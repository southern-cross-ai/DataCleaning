  Going Home</b></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;craggy cliffs upon the Norman  coast looked something like the terraced walls and turreted roofs of a ruined  city in the hot afternoon sunshine, as the Empress steamer sped swiftly onward  towards Dieppe.  At least they looked thus in the eyes of a very young lady, who stood alone on  the deck of the steam-packet, with yearning eyes fixed upon that foreign shore.</p>
<p>It was four o'clock upon a burning August afternoon in the year  1853. The steamer was fast approaching the harbour. Several moustachioed  gentlemen, of various ages, costumes, and manners, were busy getting together  carpet-bags, railway-rugs, camp-stools, newspapers, and umbrellas, preparatory  to that eager rush towards the shore by which almost all marine voyagers are  apt to testify their contempt for Neptune,  when they&nbsp;have no longer need of his service or fear of his vengeance. Two  or three English families were collected in groups, holding guard over small  mounds or barrows of luggage, having made all preparation for landing at first  sight of the Norman shore dim in the distance; and of course about two hours  too soon.</p>
<p>Several blooming young English damsels, gathered under maternal  wings, were looking forward to sea-bathing in a foreign watering-place. The  &Eacute;tablissement des Bains had not yet been built, and Dieppe was not so popular, perhaps, among  English pleasure-seekers as it now is. There were several comfortable-looking  British families on board the steamer, but, of all the friendly matrons and  pretty daughters assembled on the deck, there seemed no one in any way  connected with that lonely young lady who leant against the bulwark with a  cloak across her arm and a rather shabby carpet-bag at her feet.</p>
<p>She was very young&mdash;indeed of that age which in the other sex is  generally called the period of hobbledehoyhood. There was more ankle to be seen  below the hem of her neat muslin frock than is quite consistent with elegance  of attire in a young lady of fifteen; but, as the ankle so revealed was rounded  and slender, it would have been hypercritical to have objected to the shortness  of the skirt, which had evidently been outgrown by its wearer.</p>
<p>Then, again, this lonely traveller was not only young but  pretty. In spite of the shortness of her frock, and the shabbiness of her straw  bonnet, it was impossible for the most spiteful of the British misses to affirm  the contrary. She was very pretty: so pretty that it was a pleasure to look at  her, in her unconscious innocence, and to think how beautiful she would be  by-and-bye, when that bright, budding, girlish loveliness bloomed out in its  womanly splendour.</p>
<p>Her skin was fair but pale,&mdash;not a sentimental or sickly pallor,  but a beautiful alabaster clearness of tint. Her eyes were grey, large, and  dark, or rendered dark by the shadow of long black lashes. I would rather not  catalogue her other features too minutely; for, though they were regular, and  even beautiful, there is something low and material in all the other features  as compared to the eyes. Her hair was of a soft golden brown, bright and  rippling like a sunlit river. The brightness of that luxuriant hair, the light  in her grey eyes, and the vivacity of a very beautiful smile, made her face  seem almost luminous as she looked at you. It was difficult to imagine that she  could ever look unhappy. She seemed an animated, radiant, and exuberant  creature, who made an atmosphere of brightness and happiness about her. Other  girls of her age would have crept to a corner of the deck, perhaps to hide  their loneliness, or would have clung to the outer fringe of one of the family  groups, making believe not to be alone; but this young lady had taken her stand  boldly against the bulwark, choosing the position from which she might soonest  hope to see Dieppe harbour, and apparently quite indifferent to observation,  though many a furtive glance was cast towards the tall but girlish figure and  the handsome profile so sharply defined against a blue background of summer  sky.</p>
<p>But there was nothing unfeminine in all this; nothing bold or  defiant; it was only the innocent unconsciousness of a light-hearted girl,  ignorant of any perils which could assail her loneliness, and fearless in her  ignorance. Throughout the brief sea-voyage she had displayed no symptoms of  shyness or perplexity. She had suffered none of the tortures common to many  travellers in their marine experiences. She had not been sea-sick; and indeed  she did not look like a person who&nbsp;<i>could</i>&nbsp;be subject to any of  the common ills this weak flesh inherits. You could almost as easily have  pictured to yourself the Goddess Hygeia suffering from a bilious headache, or  Hebe laid up with the influenza, as this auburn-haired, grey-eyed young lady  under any phase of mortal suffering. Eyes, dim in the paroxysms of  sea-sickness, had looked almost spitefully towards this happy, radiant  creature, as she flitted hither and thither about the deck, courting the balmy  ocean breezes that made themselves merry with her rippling hair. Lips, blue  with suffering, had writhed as their owners beheld the sandwiches which this young  schoolgirl devoured, the stale buns, the flat raspberry tarts, the hideous,  bilious, revolting three-cornered puffs which she produced at different stages  of the voyage from her shabby carpet-bag.</p>
<p>She had an odd volume of a novel, and a long dreary desert of  crochet-work, whose white cotton monotony was only broken by occasional dingy  oases bearing witness of the worker&rsquo;s dirty hands; they were such pretty hands,  too, that it was a shame they should ever be dirty; and she had a bunch of  flabby, faded flowers, sheltered by a great fan-like shield of newspaper; and  she had a smelling-bottle, which she sniffed at perpetually, though she had no  need of any such restorative, being as fresh and bright from first to last as  the sea breezes themselves, and as little subject to any marine malady as the  Lurleis whose waving locks could scarcely have been brighter than her own.</p>
<p>I think, if the feminine voyagers on board the Empress were  cruel to this solitary young traveller in not making themselves friendly with  her in her loneliness, the unkindness must be put down very much to that  unchristian frame of mind in which people who are sea-sick are apt to regard  those who are not. This bouncing, bright-faced girl seemed to have little need  of kindness from the miserable sufferers around her; so she was left to wander  about the deck, now reading three pages of her novel, now doing half-a-dozen  stitches of her work, now talking to the man at the wheel, in spite of all  injunctions to the contrary, now making herself acquainted with stray pet dogs;  always contented, always happy, and no one troubled themselves about her.</p>
<p>It was only now, when they were nearing Dieppe that one of the passengers, an  elderly, grey-headed Englishman, spoke to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very anxious to arrive,&rdquo; he said, smiling at her eager  face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very anxious, sir. We are nearly there, are we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we shall enter the harbour presently. You will have some  one to meet you there, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; the young lady answered, lifting her arched brown  eyebrows, &ldquo;not at Dieppe.  Papa will meet me at Paris; but he could never  come all the way to Dieppe, just to take me back  to Paris. He  could never afford such an expense as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to be sure; and you know no one at Dieppe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t know any one in all France except papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face, bright as it was even in repose, was lit up with a new  brightness as she spoke of her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very fond of your papa, I think,&rdquo; the Englishman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I love him very, very much. I have not seen him for  more than a year. The journey costs so much between England  and France, and I have been  at school near London, at Brixton; I dare say  you know Brixton; but I am going to France now, for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! You seem very young to leave school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to leave school,&rdquo; the young lady answered,  eagerly. &ldquo;I am going to a very expensive school in Paris, to finish my education; and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused here, hesitating and blushing a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to be a governess. Papa is not rich. He has no  fortune now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has had a fortune, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has had three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady&rsquo;s grey eyes were lit up with a certain look of  triumph as she said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been very extravagant, poor dear,&rdquo; she continued,  apologetically; &ldquo;and he has spent three fortunes, altogether. But he has been  always so courted and admired, you know, that it is not to be wondered at. He  knew the Prince Regent, and Mr. Sheridan, and Mr. Brummel, and the Duke of  York, and&mdash;oh, all sorts of people, ever so intimately; and he was a member of  the Beefsteak Club, and wore a silver gridiron in his button-hole, and he is  the most delightful man in society, even now, though he is very old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very old! And you are so young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Englishman looked almost incredulously at his animated  companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am papa&rsquo;s youngest child. He has been married twice. I  have no real brothers and sisters. I have only half-brothers and sisters, who  don&rsquo;t really and truly care for me, you know. How should they? They were grown  up when I was born, and I have scarcely ever seen them. I have only papa in all  the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no mother, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mamma died when I was three years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Empress&rdquo; packet was entering the harbour by this time. The  grey-headed Englishman went away to look after his portmanteaus and hat-boxes,  but he returned presently to the fair-haired school-girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me help you with your luggage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will  go and look after it if you will tell me for what to inquire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind. I have only one box. It is directed to Miss  Vane, Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Vane, I will go and find your box. Stay,&rdquo; he  said, taking out his card-case, &ldquo;this is my name, and if you will permit me, I  will see you safely to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. You are very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady accepted her new friend&rsquo;s service as frankly as  it was offered. He had grey hair, and in that one particular at least resembled  her father. That was almost enough to make her like him.</p>
<p>There was the usual confusion and delay at the Custom-house&mdash;a  little squabbling and a good deal of bribery; but everything was managed, upon  the whole, pretty comfortably. Most of the passengers dropped in at the H&ocirc;tel  de l&rsquo;Europe, or some of the other hotels upon the stony quay; a few hurried off  to the market-place to stare at the cathedral church of Saint Jacques, or the  great statue of Abraham Duquesne, the rugged sea-king, with broad-brimmed hat  and waving plumes, high boots and flowing hair, and to buy peaches and apricots  of the noisy market women. Others wandered in the slimy and slippery  fish-market, fearfully and wonderingly contemplative of those hideous  conger-eels, dog-fish, and other piscatorial monstrosities which seem peculiar  to Dieppe. Miss  Vane and her companion strolled into the dusky church of Saint Jacques  by a little wooden door in a shady nook of the edifice. A few solitary women  were kneeling here and there, half-hidden behind their high-backed rush chairs.  A fisherman was praying upon the steps of a little chapel, in the solemn  obscurity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been here before,&rdquo; Miss Vane whispered. &ldquo;I came by  Dover and Calais  the last time; but this way is so much cheaper, and I don&rsquo;t mind the long sea  voyage a bit. Thank you for bringing me to see this cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half-an-hour after this the two travellers were seated in a  first-class carriage, with other railway passengers, French and English,  hurrying through the fair Norman landscape.</p>
<p>Miss Vane looked out at the bright hills and woods, the fruitful  orchards, and white-roofed cottages, so villa-like, fantastical, and beautiful;  and her face brightened with the brightening of the landscape under the hot  radiance of the sun. The grey-headed gentleman felt a quiet pleasure in  watching that earnest, hopeful, candid face; the grey eyes, illumined with gladness;  the parted lips, almost tremulous with delight, as the sunny panorama glided by  the open window.</p>
<p>The quiet old bachelor&rsquo;s heart had been won by his companion&rsquo;s  frank acceptance of his simple service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another girl of her age would have been as frightened of a  masculine stranger as of a wild beast,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and would have given  herself all manner of missish airs; but this young damsel smiles in my face,  and trusts me with almost infantile simplicity. I hope her father is a good  man. I don&rsquo;t much like that talk of Sheridan and Beau Brummel and the  Beefsteak&nbsp;Club. No very good school for fathers, that, I should fancy. I  wish her mother had been alive, poor child. I hope she is going to a happy  home, and a happy future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The train stopped at Rouen,  and Miss Vane accepted a cup of coffee and some&nbsp;<i>brioches</i>&nbsp;from  her companion. The red August sunset was melting into grey mistiness by this  time, and the first shimmer of the moonlight was silvery on the water as they  crossed the Seine and left the lighted city  behind them. The grey-headed Englishman fell asleep soon after this, and before  long there was a low chorus of snoring, masculine and feminine, audible in the  comfortable carriage; only broken now and then, when the train stopped with a  jerk at some fantastic village that looked like a collection of Swiss toy  cottages in the dim summer night.</p>
<p>But, let these matter-of-fact people snore and slumber as they  might, there was no such thing as sleep for Eleanor Vane. It would have been  utter sacrilege to have slept in the face of all that moonlighted beauty, to  have been carried sleeping through that fairy landscape. The eager  school-girl&rsquo;s watchful eyes drank in the loveliness of every hill and valley,  the low scattered woodland, the wandering streams, and that perplexing Seine, which the rumbling carriage crossed so often with  a dismal hollow sound in the stillness of the night.</p>
<p>No; Miss Vane&rsquo;s bright grey eyes were not closed once in that  evening journey; and at last, when the train entered the great Parisian  station, when all the trouble and confusion of arrival began&mdash;that wearisome  encounter of difficulty which makes cowardly travellers wish the longest  journey longer than it is&mdash;the young lady&rsquo;s head was thrust out of the window,  and her eager eyes wandered hither and thither amongst the faces of the crowd.</p>
<p>Yes, he was there&mdash;her father. That white-haired old man, with  the gold-headed cane, and the aristocratic appearance. She pointed him out  eagerly to her fellow-passenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is papa&mdash;you see,&mdash;the handsome man. He is coming this way,  but he doesn&rsquo;t see us. Oh, let me out, please; let me go to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She trembled in her eagerness, and her fair face flushed crimson  with excitement. She forgot her carpet-bag, her novel, her crochet, her  smelling-bottle, her cloak, her parasol&mdash;all her paraphernalia; and left her  companion to collect them as best he might. She was out of the carriage and in  her father&rsquo;s arms she scarcely knew how. The platform seemed deserted all in a  moment, for the passengers had rushed away to a great dreary&nbsp;<i>salle  d&rsquo;attente</i>, there to await the inspection of their luggage. Miss Vane, her  fellow-traveller, and her father were almost alone, and she was looking up at  the old man&rsquo;s face in the lamplight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, dear, papa, darling, how well you are looking; as well as  ever, as well as ever, I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father drew himself up proudly. He was past seventy years of  age, but he was a very handsome man. His beauty was of that patrician type  which loses little by age. He was tall and broad-chested, erect as a Grenadier,  but not fat. The Prince Regent might become corpulent, and lay himself open to  the insolent sneers of his sometime boon companion and friend; but Mr. George  Mowbray Vandeleur Vane held himself on his guard against that insidious foe which  steals away the graces of so many elderly gentlemen. Mr. Vane&rsquo;s aristocratic  bearing imparted such a stamp to his clothes, that it was not easy to see the  shabbiness of his garments; but those garments were shabby; carefully as they  had been brushed, they bore the traces of that slow decay which is not to be  entirely concealed, whatever the art of the wearer.</p>
<p>Miss Vane&rsquo;s travelling companion saw all this. He had been so  much interested by the young lady&rsquo;s frank and fearless manner, that he would  fain have lingered in the hope of learning something of her father&rsquo;s character,  but he felt that he had no excuse for delaying his departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wish you good night, now, Miss Vane,&rdquo; he said, kindly,  &ldquo;since you are safely restored to your papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane lifted his grey eyebrows, looked at his daughter  interrogatively; rather suspiciously, the traveller thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa, dear,&rdquo; the young lady answered, in reply to that  questioning look, &ldquo;this gentleman was on board the boat with me, and he has  been so very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She searched in her pocket for the card which her acquaintance  had given her, and produced that document, rather limp and crumpled. Her father  looked at it, murmured the name inscribed upon it twice or thrice, as if trying  to attach some importance thereto, but evidently failed in doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the honour of&mdash;a&mdash;haw&mdash;knowing this name sir,&rdquo; he said,  lifting his hat stiffly about half a yard from his silvered head; &ldquo;but for your  courtesy and kindness to my child, I hope you will accept my best thanks. I was  prevented by important business of&mdash;a&mdash;haw&mdash;not altogether undiplomatic  character&mdash;from crossing the Channel to fetch my daughter; and&mdash;aw&mdash;also&mdash;prevented  from sending my servant&mdash;by&mdash;aw&mdash;I thank you for your politeness, sir. You are a  stranger, by the way. Can I do anything for you in Paris? Lord Cowley is my very old friend; any  service that I can render you in that quarter&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traveller bowed and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am no stranger in Paris. I will wish you  good night; good night, Miss Vane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Vane was not going to let his daughter&rsquo;s friend off so  easily. He produced his card-case, murmured more pompous assurances of his  gratitude, and tendered further offers of patronage to the quiet traveller, who  found something rather oppressive in Mr. Vane&rsquo;s civility. But it was all over  at last, and the old man led his daughter off to look for the trunk which  contained all her worldly possessions.</p>
<p>The stranger looked wistfully after the father and child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she may have a happy future,&rdquo; he thought, rather  despondingly; &ldquo;the old man is&nbsp;poor and pompous. He tells lies which bring  hot blushes into his daughter&rsquo;s beautiful face. I am very sorry for her.&rdquo;</p>

  The Entresol In The Rue L&rsquo;archev&egrave;que</b></h2>
<p>Mr. Vane&nbsp;took his daughter away from the  station in one of those secondary and cheaper vehicles which are distinguished  by the discriminating Parisian by some mysterious difference of badge. The  close, stifling carriage rattled over the uneven stones of long streets which  were unfamiliar to Eleanor Vane, until it emerged into the full glory of the  lighted Boulevard. The light-hearted school-girl could not suppress a cry of  rapture as she looked once more at the broad thoroughfare, the dazzling lamps,  the crowd, the theatres, the caf&eacute;s, the beauty and splendour, although she had  spent her summer holiday in Paris only a year before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so beautiful again, papa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;just as if I&rsquo;d  never seen it before; and I&rsquo;m to stop here now, and never, never to leave you  again, to go away for such a cruel distance. You don&rsquo;t know how unhappy I&rsquo;ve  been, sometimes, papa dear. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you then, for fear of making you  uneasy; but I can tell you now, now that it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy!&rdquo; gasped the old man, clenching his fist, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve not  been unkind to you&mdash;they&rsquo;ve not dared&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, dearest father. They&rsquo;ve been very, very good. I was  quite a favourite, papa. Yes, though there were so many rich girls in the  school, and I was only a half-boarder, I was quite a favourite with Miss  Bennett and Miss Lavinia; though I know I was careless and lazy sometimes, not  on purpose, you know, papa, for I tried hard to get on with my education, for  your sake, darling. No, everybody was very kind to me, papa; but I used to  think sometimes how far I was from you; what miles and miles and miles of sea  and land there were between us, and that if you should be ill&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane broke down, and her father clasped her in his arms,  and cried over her silently. The tears came with very little provocation to the  old man&rsquo;s handsome blue eyes. He was of that sanguine temperament which to the  last preserves the fondest delusions of youth. At seventy-five years of age he  hoped and dreamed and deluded himself as foolishly as he had done at seventeen.  His sanguine temperament had been for ever leading him astray for more than  sixty years. Severe judges called George Vane a liar; but perhaps his shallow  romances, his pitiful boasts, were very often highly-coloured versions of the  truth, rather than actual falsehood.</p>
<p>It was past twelve o&rsquo;clock when the carriage drove away from the  lights and splendour into the darkness of a labyrinth of quiet streets behind  the Madeleine. The Rue l&rsquo;Archev&egrave;que was one of these dingy and quiet streets,  very narrow, very close and stifling in the hot August midnight. The vehicle  stopped abruptly at a corner, before a little shop, the shutters of which were  closed, of course, at this hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a butcher&rsquo;s shop, I am sorry to say, my love,&rdquo; Mr. Vane  said, apologetically, as he handed his daughter on to the pavement; &ldquo;but I find  myself very comfortable here, and it is conveniently adjacent to the  Boulevards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man paid the driver, who had deposited mademoiselle&rsquo;s  box upon the threshold of the little door beside the butcher&rsquo;s shop. The&nbsp;<i>pour-boire</i>&nbsp;was  not a very large one, but Mr. Vane bestowed it with the air of a prince. He  pushed open the low door, and took his daughter into a narrow passage. There  was no porter or portress, for the butcher&rsquo;s shop and the apartments belonging  to it were abnormal altogether; but there was a candle and box of matches on a  shelf in a corner of the steep corkscrew staircase. The driver carried  Eleanor&rsquo;s box as far as the entresol in consideration of his&nbsp;<i>pour-boire</i>,  but departed while Mr. Vane was opening the door of an apartment facing the  staircase.</p>
<p>The entresol consisted of three little rooms, opening one out of  another, and so small and low that Miss Vane almost fancied herself in a doll&rsquo;s  house. Every article of furniture in the stifling little apartment bore the  impress of its nationality. Tawdry curtains of figured damask, resplendent with  dirty tulips and monster roses, tarnished ormolu mouldings, a gilded clock with  a cracked dial and a broken shade, a pair of rickety bronze candlesticks, a  couple of uncompromising chairs covered with dusty green velvet and relieved by  brass-headed nails, and a square table with a long trailing cover of the same  material as the curtains completed the adornments of the sitting-room. The  bed-chambers were smaller, closer, and hotter. Voluminous worsted curtains  falling before the narrow windows, and smothering the little beds, made the  stifling atmosphere yet more stifling. The low ceilings seemed to rest on the  top of poor Eleanor&rsquo;s head. She had been accustomed to large, airy rooms and  broad, uncurtained open windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How hot it is here, papa,&rdquo; she said, drawing a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It always is hot in Paris  at this time of year, my dear,&rdquo; Mr. Vane answered; &ldquo;the rooms are small you  see, but convenient. That is to be your bed-room, my love,&rdquo; he added,  indicating one of the little chambers.</p>
<p>He was evidently habituated to Parisian lodging houses, and saw  no discomfort in the tawdry grandeur, the shabby splendour, the pitiful attempt  to substitute scraps of gilding and patches of velvet for the common  necessaries and decencies of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let me look at you, my dear; let me look at you,  Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Mowbray Vane set the candlestick upon the rusty velvet  cover of the low mantelpiece, and drew his daughter towards him. She had thrown  off her bonnet and loose grey cloak, and stood before her father in her scanty  muslin frock with all her auburn hair hanging about her face and shoulders, and  glittering in the dim light of that one scrap of wax candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pet, how beautiful you have grown, how beautiful!&rdquo; the old  man said, with an accent of fond tenderness. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll teach Mrs. Bannister a  lesson some of these days, Eleanor. Yes,&nbsp;<i>our</i>&nbsp;turn will come,  my love; I know that I shall die a rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Vane was accustomed to hear this remark from her father.  She inherited something of his sanguine nature, and she loved him very dearly,  so she may be forgiven if she believed in his vague visions of future grandeur.  She had never seen anything in her life but chaotic wrecks of departed splendour,  confusion, debt, and difficulty. She had not been called upon to face poverty  in the fair hand-to-hand struggle which ennobles and elevates the sturdy  wrestler in the battle of life. No, she had rather been compelled to play at  hide-and-seek with the grim enemy. She had never gone out into the open, and  looked her foe full in the eyes, hardy, resolute, patient, and steadfast. She  was familiar with all those debasing tricks and pitiful subterfuges whereby the  weak and faint-hearted seek to circumvent the enemy; but she had never been  taught the use of those measures by which he may be honestly beaten.</p>
<p>The Mrs. Bannister of whom George Vane had spoken, was one of  his elder daughters, who had been very, very ungrateful to him, he declared,  and who now in his old age doled him out the pitiful allowance which enabled  him to occupy an entresol over a butcher&rsquo;s shop, and dine daily at one of the  cheap restaurants in the Palais Royal.</p>
<p>Mr. Vane was wont to lament his daughter&rsquo;s cruel lack of  affection in very bitter language, freely interspersed with quotations from  &ldquo;King Lear;&rdquo; indeed I believe he considered his case entirely parallel with  that of the injured British monarch and father; ignoring the one rather  important fact that, whereas Lear&rsquo;s folly had been the too generous division of  his own fortune between his recreant daughters,&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;weakness  had been the reckless waste and expenditure of the portions which his children  had inherited from their mother.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bannister, instigated thereto by her husband, had protested  some years before against the several acts of folly and extravagance by which  the fortune which ought to have been hers had been fooled away. She declined to  allow her father more than the pittance alluded to above; although, as she was  now a rich widow, and of course entirely her own mistress, she might have done  much more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my darling,&rdquo; Mr. Vane said, as he proudly contemplated his  youngest child&rsquo;s beauty, &ldquo;we will turn the tables upon Mrs. Bannister and the  rest of them, yet, please God. My Benjamin, my youngest, brightest darling,  we&rsquo;ll teach them a lesson. They may poke their old father away in a foreign  lodging, and stint him of money for any little innocent pleasure; but the day  will come, my love, the day will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded his head two or three times with solemn  significance. I don&rsquo;t think his daughter had the remotest idea what vision it  was that lured him onward through all present miseries, cheating him with some  shadowy hope, far away in the future. I think that even he could scarcely have  explained what it was he looked forward to in the day that was to come; but the  sanguine, impulsive nature, dwarfed and fettered by the cruel bonds of poverty,  was too elastic to be entirely repressed even by those galling chains; and  having hoped all his life, and having enjoyed such successes and good fortune  as fall to the lot of very few men, he went on hoping in his old age, blindly  confident that some unlooked-for and undreamed-of revolution in the wheel of  life would lift him out of his obscurity and set him again on the pinnacle he  had once occupied so proudly.</p>
<p>He had had a host of friends and many children, and he had  squandered more than one fortune, not being any more careful of other people&rsquo;s  money than of his own; and now, in his poverty and desolation, the child of his  old age was the only one who clung to him and loved him and believed in him;  the only one whom he loved, perhaps, truly and unreservedly, though he wept  frequently over the ingratitude of the others. It may be that Eleanor was the  only one whom he could love with any comfort to himself, because the only one  he had never injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, papa, dear,&rdquo; this youngest and best loved of the old man&rsquo;s  children pleaded gently, &ldquo;Mrs. Bannister, Hortensia, has been very good&mdash;has she  not?&mdash;in sending the money for my education at Madame Marly&rsquo;s, where she was  finished herself. That was very generous of her, wasn&rsquo;t it, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane shook his head, and lifted his grey eyebrows with a  deprecating expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hortensia Bannister cannot perform a generous act in a generous  manner, my dear. You recognise the viper by the reptile&rsquo;s sting: you may  recognise Hortensia in pretty much the same manner. She gives, but she insults  the recipients of her&mdash;ahem&mdash;bounty. Shall I read you her letter, Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, dear papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady had seated herself, in a somewhat hoydenish  manner, upon the elbow of her father&rsquo;s chair, and had wound her soft round arm  about his neck. She loved him and believed in him. The world which had courted  and admired him while he had money and could boast such acquaintance as the  Prince and Sheridan, Sir Francis Burdett, Lord Castlereagh, Mr. Pitt, and the  Duke of York, had fallen away from him of late; and the few old associates who  yet remained of that dead-and-gone cycle were apt to avoid him, influenced  perhaps by the recollection of small loans of an occasional five-pound note,  and &ldquo;a little silver,&rdquo; which had not been repaid. Yes, the world had fallen  away from George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane, once of Vandeleur  Park, Cheshire,  and Mowbray Castle,  near York. The  tradesmen who had helped to squander his money had let him get very deep in  their books before they closed those cruel ledgers, and stopped all supplies.  He had existed for a long time&mdash;he had lived as a gentleman, he said  himself&mdash;upon the traditions of the past, the airy memories of the fortunes he  had wasted. But this was all over now, and he had emigrated to the city in  which he had played the Grand Seigneur in those glorious early days of the  Restoration, and he was compelled to lead a low and vulgar life, disgracing  himself by pettifogging ready-money dealings, utterly degrading to a gentleman.</p>
<p>He could not bring himself to own that he was better and happier  in this new life, and that it was pleasant to be able to walk erect and defiant  upon the Boulevards, rather than to be compelled to plunge down dark alleys,  and dive into sinuous byways, for the avoidance of importunate creditors, as he  had been in free England.</p>
<p>He took his wealthy daughter&rsquo;s letter from the breast-pocket of  his coat; a fashionable coat, though shabby now, for it had been made for him  by a sentimental German tailor, who had wept over his late patron&rsquo;s altered  fortunes, and given him credit for a suit of clothes. That compassionate German  tailor never expected to be paid; and the clothes were a benefaction, a gift as  purely and generously given as any Christian dole offered in the holy name of  charity; but Mr. Vane was pleased with the fiction of an expected payment, and would  have revolted against the idea of receiving a present from the good-natured  tradesman.</p>
<p>The letter from Hortensia Bannister was not a long one. It was  written in sharp and decisive paragraphs, and in a neat, firm hand. Rather a  cruel-looking hand, Eleanor Vane thought.</p>
<p>The old man put a double gold eyeglass over his nose, and began  to read.</p>
<p class="note"><i>Hyde Park Gardens, August 13, 1853.</i> </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My  dear Father,&mdash;In compliance with your repeated solicitations I  have determined upon taking measures by which I hope the future welfare of your  youngest daughter may be secured.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I must, however, remind you that Eleanor Vane and I are the  children of different mothers; that she has therefore less claim upon me than a  sister usually has; and I freely confess I never heard of one sister being  called upon to provide for another.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You must also remember that I never entertained any degree of  friendship or affection for Eleanor&rsquo;s mother, who was much below you in  station&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor started; she was too impetuous to listen quite passively  to this letter. Her father felt the sudden movement of the arm about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother was an angel, my dear,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and this woman  is&mdash;never mind what. My daughters chose to give themselves airs to your poor  mother because she had been their governess, and because her father had failed  as a sugar-broker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to the letter, groping nervously for the place at  which he had left off, with the point of his well-shaped finger&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And who also was the indirect cause of injury to myself and my  sisters, as she participated in the extravagant expenditure, of at least some  part of the money which by every legal and moral claim belonged to us.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;But you tell me that you have no power to make any provision  whatsoever for your daughter; and that, unless I assist you, this unhappy girl  may, in the event of your death, be flung penniless upon the world, imperfectly  educated, and totally incompetent to get her living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She speaks of my death very freely,&rdquo; the old man murmured, &ldquo;but  she&rsquo;s right enough. I shan&rsquo;t trouble anybody long, my dear; I shan&rsquo;t trouble  anybody long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tender arms wound themselves more closely about George  Vane&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, darling,&rdquo; the soft voice whispered, &ldquo;you have never  troubled&nbsp;<i>me</i>. Don&rsquo;t go on with that horrid letter, papa. We won&rsquo;t  accept any favours from such a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, my love, for your sake; if I stoop, it is for your  sake, Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man went on reading.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Under these circumstances,&rdquo; the writer continued, &ldquo;I have come  to the following determination. I will give you a hundred pounds, to be paid to  Madame Marly, who knows you, and has received a great deal of money from you  for my education and that of my sisters, and who will, therefore, be inclined  to receive Eleanor upon advantageous terms. For this sum of money Madame Marly  will, I feel assured, consent to prepare my half-sister for the situation of  governess in a gentleman&rsquo;s family; that is, of course, premising that Eleanor  has availed herself conscientiously of the advantages afforded her by her  residence with the Misses Bennett.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I shall write to Madame Marly by this post, using my best  influence with her for Eleanor&rsquo;s benefit; and, should I receive a favourable  reply to this letter, I will immediately send you a hundred pounds, to be paid  by you to Madame Marly.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I do this in order that you may not appear to my old  instructress&mdash;who remembers you as a rich man&mdash;in the position of a pauper; but  in thus attempting to spare your feelings, and perhaps my own, I fear that I  run some risk.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Let me therefore warn you that this money is the last I will  ever pay for my half-sister&rsquo;s benefit. Squander or misuse it if you please. You  have robbed me often, and would not perhaps hesitate to do so again. But bear  in mind, that this time it is Eleanor you will rob and not me.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The only chance she will have of completing her education is  the chance I now give her. Rob her of this and you rob her of an honourable  future. Deprive her of this and you make yourself answerable for any  misfortunes which may befall her when you are dead and gone.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Forgive me if I have spoken harshly, or even undutifully; my  excuse lies in your past follies. I have spoken strongly because I wished to  make a strong impression, and I believe that I have acted for the best.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Once for all, remember that I will attend to no future  solicitations on Eleanor&rsquo;s behalf. If she makes good use of the help I now  afford her, I may perhaps be tempted to render her further  services&mdash;unsolicited&mdash;in the future. If she or you make a bad use of this one  chance, I wash my hands of all concern in your future miseries.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The money will be made payable at Messrs. Blount&rsquo;s, Rue de la  Paix.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I trust you attend the Protestant Church  in the Rue Rivoli.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;With best wishes  for your welfare, temporal and eternal,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I remain, my dear  father,&#8288;<br>
&ldquo;Your affectionate  daughter,&#8288;<br>
&ldquo;Hortensia Bannister.&rdquo;&#8288;</p>
<p>George Vane burst into tears as he finished the letter. How  cruelly she had stabbed him, this honourable, conscientious daughter, whom he  had robbed certainly, but in a generous, magnanimous, reckless fashion, that  made robbery rather a princely virtue than a sordid vice. How cruelly the old  heart was lacerated by that bitter letter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I would touch the money,&rdquo; cried Mr. Vane, elevating his  trembling hands to the low ceiling with a passionate and tragic gesture. &ldquo;Have  I been such a wretch to you, Eleanor, that this woman should accuse me of  wishing to snatch the bread from your innocent lips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I been such an unnatural father, such a traitor, liar,  swindler, and cheat, that my own daughter should say these things to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice rose higher with each sentence, and the tears streamed  down his wrinkled cheeks.</p>
<p>Eleanor tried to kiss away those tears; but he pushed her from  him with passionate vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away from me, my child, I am a wretch, a robber, a  scoundrel, a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, papa,&rdquo; cried Eleanor, &ldquo;you are all that is good,  you have always been good to me, dear, dear papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what right then does this woman insult me with such a letter  as that?&rdquo; asked the old man, drying his eyes, and pointing to the crumpled  letter which he had flung upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has no right, papa,&rdquo; answered Eleanor. &ldquo;She is a wicked,  cruel woman. But we&rsquo;ll send back her money. I&rsquo;d rather go out into the world at  once, papa, and work for you: I&rsquo;d rather be a dressmaker. I could learn soon if  I tried very hard. I do know a little about dressmaking. I made this dress, and  it fits very well, only I cut out both the backs for one side, and both sleeves  for one arm, and that wasted the stuff you know, and made the skirt a little  scanty. I&rsquo;d rather do anything, papa, than accept this money,&mdash;I would indeed. I  don&rsquo;t want to go to this grand Parisian school, except to be near you, papa,  darling. That was the only thing I ever cared for. The Miss Bennetts would take  me as a pupil teacher, and give me fifteen pounds a-year, and I&rsquo;d send every  shilling of it to you, papa, and then you needn&rsquo;t live over a wretched shop  where the meat smells nasty in the warm weather. We won&rsquo;t take the money, will  we, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head, and made a motion with his lips and  throat, as if he had been gulping down some bitter draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of ineffable resignation,  &ldquo;for your sake I would suffer many humiliations; for your sake I will endure  this. We will take no notice of this woman&rsquo;s letter; though I could write her a  reply that&mdash;but no matter. We will let her insolence pass, and she shall never  know how keenly it has stung me, here, here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tapped his breast as he spoke, and the tears rose again to  his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will accept this money, Eleanor,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we will  accept her bounty; and the day may come when you will have ample power to  retaliate&mdash;ample power, my dear. She has called me a thief, Eleanor,&rdquo; exclaimed  the old man, suddenly returning to his own wrongs,&mdash;&ldquo;a thief! My own daughter  has called me a thief, and accused me of the baseness of robbing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, papa, darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if your father could rob you of this money, Eleanor; as if I  could touch a penny of it. No, so help me Heaven! not a penny of it to save me  from starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His head sank forward upon his breast, and he sat for some  minutes muttering to himself in broken sentences, as if almost unconscious of  his daughter&rsquo;s presence. In that time he looked older than he had looked at any  moment since his daughter had met him at the station. Looking at him now,  wistfully and sorrowfully, Eleanor Vane saw that her father was indeed an old  man, vacillating and weak of purpose, and with ample need of all the compassionate  tenderness, the fond affection which overflowed her girlish heart as she looked  at him. She knelt down on the slippery oaken floor at his feet, and took his  tremulous hand in both of hers.</p>
<p>He started as she touched him, and looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had nothing to eat; you&rsquo;ve been  nearly an hour in the house, and you&rsquo;ve had nothing to eat. But I&rsquo;ve not  forgotten you, Nell, you&rsquo;ll find I&rsquo;ve not forgotten you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose from his chair, and went over to a buffet, from which he  took a couple of plates and tumblers, some knives and forks, and two or three  parcels wrapped in white paper, and neatly tied with narrow red tape. He put  these on the table, and going a second time to the buffet produced a pint  bottle of claret, in a basket; very dusty and cobwebby; and therefore, no  doubt, very choice.</p>
<p>The white paper parcels contained very recherch&eacute; comestibles. A  slender wedge of truffled turkey, some semi-transparent slices of German  sausage, and an open plum tart, with a great deal of rich ruby coloured syrup,  and an utterly uneatable crust.</p>
<p>Miss Vane partook very freely of this little collation, praising  her father for his goodness and indulgence as she ate the simple feast he had  prepared for her. But she did not like the Burgundy in the dusty basket, and preferred  to drink some water out of one of the toilette bottles.</p>
<p>Her father, however, enjoyed the pint of good wine, and  recovered his equanimity under its generous influence. He had never been a  drunkard; he had indeed one of those excitable natures which cannot endure the  influence of strong drinks, and a very little wine had considerable effect upon  him.</p>
<p>He talked a good deal, therefore, to his daughter, told her some  of his delusive hopes in the future, tried to explain some of the plans which  he had formed for his and her advancement, and was altogether very happy and  social. The look of age which had been so strong upon him half an hour before  faded out like a gray morning shadow under the broadening sunlight. He was a  young man again, proud, hopeful, defiant, handsome, ready to run through three  more fortunes, if they should fall to his lot.</p>
<p>It was past two o&rsquo;clock when Eleanor Vane lay down, thoroughly  exhausted, but not weary&mdash;she had one of those natures which seem never to grow  weary&mdash;to fall asleep for the first time in four-and-twenty hours.</p>
<p>Her father did not quite so quickly fall into a peaceful  slumber. He lay awake for upwards of an hour, tumbling and tossing to and fro  upon the narrow spring mattress, and muttering to himself.</p>
<p>And even in his sleep, though the early summer dawn was gray in  the room when he fell into a fitful and broken slumber, the trouble of his  eldest daughter&rsquo;s letter was heavy upon him, for every now and then he  muttered, disjointedly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thief&mdash;swindler. As if&mdash;as if&mdash;I would&mdash;rob&mdash;my own daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter  3<br>
  The Story Of The Past</b></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;history of George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane was the  history of many men whose lot was to shine in that brilliant orbit of which  George, Prince Regent, was the ruling star. Around that dazzling royal planet  how many smaller lights revolved, twinkling in humble emulation of their  prince&rsquo;s glory. What were fortune, friends, children, wives or creditors, when  weighed in the balance, if the royal favour, the princely smile hung on the  other side of the scale? If George the Fourth was pleased to bring ruin upon  himself and his creditors, how should his friends and associates do less?  Looking backward at the spurious glitter, the mock splendour, the hollow  delight of that wonderful age which is so near us in point of time, so far away  from us by reason of the wide differences which divide to-day from that foolish  yesterday, we can of course afford to be very wise, and can clearly see what a  very witch&rsquo;s sabbath was that long revelry in which the fourth George of  England led the dance. But who shall doubt that the dancers themselves saw the  fantastic caperings of their leader in a very different light, and looked upon  their model as worthy of all mortal praise and imitation.</p>
<p>The men of that frivolous era seem to have abandoned themselves  to unmanly weakness, and followed the fashions set them by the fat and  pale-faced Royal Adonis, as blindly as the women of to-day emulate the Imperial  caprices of the&nbsp;Tuilleries, sacrificing themselves as burnt offerings to  the Moloch of fashion, in obedience to the laws made by a lady who lives in a  palace; and who, when she wears her silken robe three yards in length and six  in circumference, can scarcely be expected to foresee the nervous tortures  by-and-bye to be endured by Mr. John Smith, of Peckham Rye, whose wife will  insist on having a hoop and train&nbsp;<i>al looj&eacute;nee</i>, and sweeping her  superabundant skirts into the fender and across the back of the grate every  time she steers her difficult way about the worthy Smith&rsquo;s fourteen feet by  twelve front parlour.</p>
<p>Yes, if Cleopatra melts pearls in her wine, and sails in a  galley of gold, we must have sham jewels to dissolve in our inferior vintages,  and sham gold to adorn our galleys. If Pericles, or Charles, or George, affects  splendour and ruin, the prince&rsquo;s devoted subjects must ruin themselves also,  never letting their master see anything but smiling faces amid the general  wreck, and utterly heedless of such minor considerations as wives and children,  creditors and friends.</p>
<p>George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane ruined himself with a grace that  was only second to that of his royal model. He began life with a fair estate  left him by his father, and having contrived to squander the best part of his  patrimony within a few years of his coming of age, was so lucky as to marry the  only daughter and heiress of a rich banker, thereby acquiring a second fortune  just at that critical moment when the first was on the verge of exhaustion. He  was not a bad husband to the simple girl who loved and worshipped him with a  foolishly confiding worship. It was not in his nature to be wilfully bad to  anybody, for he was of a genial, generous spirit, with warm affections for  those who pleased him and ministered to his happiness. He introduced his young  wife to very brilliant people, and led her into sacred and inner circles  whither her father the banker could never have taken her; but he squandered her  money foolishly and recklessly. He broke down the bulwarks of parchment with  which the lawyers had hoped to protect her fortune. He made light of the  settlements which were to provide for the future of his children. They were  only blooming and beautiful young creatures in cambric frocks and blue sashes;  and surely, Mr. Vane urged, they had nothing to complain of, for hadn&rsquo;t they  splendid apartments and costly dresses, nurses, governesses, masters,  carriages, ponies, and indulgences of every kind? What did they want then, or  in what manner did he fail in his duty towards those innocent darlings? Had not  his Royal Highness, the Duke of Kent himself, come to Vandeleur to stand  sponsor for Edward George? Had not Hortensia Georgina received her second name  after the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, in whose lovely arms she had been  dandled when only a fortnight old.</p>
<p>Were there any earthly honours or splendours, within the limit  of reasonable desire, which George Vane had failed to procure for his wife and  children?</p>
<p>The gentle lady was fain to answer this question in the  negative, and to accept it for what it was not; namely, an answer to the  questions she had ventured to ask touching the future of those unconscious  children. Mr. Vane could always persuade his simple wife to sign away any of  those parchment defences the lawyers had devised for her protection; and when  after an elegant little&nbsp;<i>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</i>&nbsp;dinner, in the arrangement  of which the&nbsp;<i>ch&egrave;f</i>&nbsp;had displayed his most consummate skill, the  affectionate husband produced a diamond bracelet, or an emerald heart, from its  morocco casket, and clasped the jewel upon his wife&rsquo;s slender arm, or hung it  round her delicate throat, with the tears glistening in his handsome blue eyes,  gentle Margaret Vane forgot the sacrifices of the morning, and all those  shadowy doubts which were wont to torment her when she contemplated the future.</p>
<p>Then again, Mr. Vane had an unfailing excuse for present  imprudence in the expectation of a third fortune, which was to come to him from  his bachelor uncle and godfather, Sir Milwood Mowbray, of Mowbray Castle, York;  so there were no vulgar retrenchments either at Vandeleur Park or in Berkeley  Square, and when Sir Milwood&rsquo;s fortune did come, in the due course of life and  death, to his nephew&rsquo;s hands, it only came just in time to stave off the ruin  that threatened George Vane&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p>If Mr. Vane had then taken his wife&rsquo;s advice, all might have  been well; but the Mowbray fortune seemed like the other two fortunes, quite  inexhaustible, the sanguine gentleman forgetting that he was in debt to full  half its amount. The French&nbsp;<i>ch&egrave;f</i>&nbsp;still prepared dinners which  might have made Oude himself tremble for his laurels; the German governess and  the Parisian lady&rsquo;s-maids still attended upon Mr. Vane&rsquo;s daughters; the old  career of extravagance went on. George Vane carried his family to the  continent, and plunged them into new gaieties at the court of the restored  Louis. He sent his daughters to the most expensive finishing school in Paris, that very Madame  Marly&rsquo;s of whom mention has been made in the last chapter. He took them to Italy and Switzerland. He hired a villa by  the lake of Como;  a chateau on the borders of Lausanne.  He followed the footsteps of Byron and D&rsquo;Orsay, Madame de Stael and Lady  Blessington; he affected art, literature, and music. He indulged his children&rsquo;s  every caprice, he gratified their wildest fancies. It was only when the sons  saw themselves penniless and professionless, with the great battle of life all  before them, and with no weapons wherewith to fight; and the daughters found  themselves left portionless to win the best husbands they might in the  matrimonial lottery; it was only at this crisis that these ungrateful children  turned round upon poor indulgent Lear, and reproached him for the extravagances  they had helped him to perpetrate.</p>
<p>This was a cruelty which George Vane could never bring himself  to comprehend. Had he denied them anything, these heartless children, that they  should turn upon him now in his old age&mdash;it would have been rather a dangerous  thing for anyone else to have alluded to his age, though he spoke freely enough  of his grey hairs when bewailing his wrongs&mdash;and be angry with him, because he  could not give them fortunes? This thanklessness was worse than a serpent&rsquo;s  tooth. It was now that Mr. Vane began to quote &ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; piteously likening  himself to that too confiding monarch.</p>
<p>But he was sixty years old now and had lived his life. His  gentle and trusting wife had died ten years before, his money was gone, and of  all his six children there was not one who would say a word in his defence. The  most affectionate and dutiful of them were only silent, and thought they did  much in withholding their reproaches. So he let them go their ways, the two  sons to fight the battle of life how they might&mdash;the two daughters to marry.  They were both handsome and accomplished, and they married well. And being left  quite alone in the world, with nothing left him but the traditions of a  brilliant past, Mr. Vane united his misfortunes to those of a very beautiful  girl who had been his daughter&rsquo;s governess, and who had fallen in love with his  splendid graces, in the very simplicity of her heart, thinking his grey hairs  more beautiful than the raven locks of meaner men.</p>
<p>Yes; George Vane possessed the gift of fascination in a  dangerous degree, and his second wife loved and believed in him in the day of his  decline, as entirely as his first wife had done in the brighter hours of his  prosperity. She loved and trusted him. She bore with a life of perpetual debt  and daily difficulty. She sacrificed herself to the mean shifts and petty  stratagems of a dishonest existence. She, whose nature was truth itself,  humiliated herself for her husband&rsquo;s sake, and helped to play that pitiful,  skulking game of hide-and-seek in which George Vane hoped to escape the honest  struggles of poverty.</p>
<p>But she died young, worn out, perhaps, by these incessant  miseries, and not able to draw consolation from the sham splendour and tinselly  grandeur with which George Vane tried to invest his fallen state. She died  within five years of her marriage, leaving a distracted and despairing old man  as the sole guardian and protector of her only child.</p>
<p>This calamity was the bitterest blow that George Vane had ever  been called upon to endure. He had loved his second wife, the wife of his  poverty and humiliation, far more dearly than he had loved the obedient partner  of his splendour and prosperity. She had been more to him a thousand times,  this gentle girl who had so uncomplainingly accepted the hardships of her lot,  because there had been no idle vanities, no hollow glories, no Princes and Beefsteak  Clubs, to stand between him and his love of her.</p>
<p>She was lost, and he remembered how little he had done to prove  his affection for her.&nbsp;<i>She</i>&nbsp;had never reproached him; no word  of upbraiding had ever crossed those tender lips. But how did he know that he  had not wronged her as cruelly as he had wronged those noisy children who had  betrayed and deserted him?</p>
<p>He remembered how often he had slighted her advice, her loving  counsel, so pure and true, so modestly offered, so gently spoken. He remembered  how many humiliations he had forced upon her, how many falsehoods he had  compelled her to tell; how often he had imposed upon her affection, suffering  her to slave for him in his blind selfishness.</p>
<p>He could remember all these things now that she was gone, and  that it was too late; too late to fall at her feet and tell her that he was all  unworthy of her love and goodness; too late to offer her even such poor  atonement for the past as penitence and tears. A hundred tokens of her in his  poor lodgings recalled her a hundred times a day, bringing the tears into this  poor broken-down mourner&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>He did not need the presence of his little daughter, whose dark  grey eyes looked at him like hers, whose auburn hair had the same golden glory  that he had so often seen glistening in the sunshine as he sat lazily watching  the low evening light upon his wife&rsquo;s drooping head. It seemed only yesterday  that she had stood in the window working for him&mdash;for him.</p>
<p>His affliction left him for a long time a broken old man. He did  not care in this dull interval of despair to keep up those outward shams of  prosperity which he had so persistently preserved. His fashionable coats and  boots, treasured so carefully of late, were no longer objects of tender care  and delight to him. He ceased to go out into that ignorant and careless world  in which he could still&nbsp;play the fine gentleman. He shut himself up and  abandoned himself to his grief, and it was a long time before his frivolous  nature recovered the shock he had suffered. It is not to be wondered at that,  in the agony of his bereavement, his youngest child became unspeakably dear to  him. He had severed all the links which had bound him to the past, and to his  elder children. His second marriage had made a new era in his life. If he  thought of these elder children at all, it was only to remember that some of  them were living in luxury, and that they ought to support him in his penniless  old age. If he wrote to them, he wrote begging-letters, appealing to them in  exactly the same spirit as he might have appealed to the Duke of Wellington or  Miss Burdett Coutts.</p>
<p>Yes; his youngest daughter usurped the place of an only child in  the old man&rsquo;s heart. He indulged her as he had indulged the ungrateful elder  children. He could not give her carriages and horses, liveried servants and  splendid houses, but he could now and then prevail upon some weak-minded  creditor to trust him, and would come home triumphant to his shabby lodging,  bearing spoils for his beloved Eleanor. He would hire a brougham from a confiding  livery-stable keeper, and would take his little girl for a drive in the  country. He would get her fine dresses from the silk-mercers who had supplied  his elder daughters, and he would compensate her for the shabby miseries of her  every-day existence by chance flashes of radiance and glory.</p>
<p>Then, again, he would very often obtain small sums of money,  loans from private friends, it may be, or fleeting treasures from a mysterious  source, of which his innocent little daughter had no knowledge. So, for the  first ten or eleven years of her life, Miss Vane&rsquo;s existence was chequered by  sudden glimpses of abnormal wealth&mdash;wonderful feast days of luxury and  extravagance&mdash;which contrasted sharply with the dreary poverty of her ordinary  experiences.</p>
<p>Thus it was no uncommon thing for this young lady to dine to-day  in a tawdry and rather dirty parlour at Chelsea upon tea and red-herrings, and  to-morrow to sit opposite her father in one of the sunny windows at the Crown  and Sceptre, eating white-bait with the calm enjoyment of a connoisseur, and  looking placidly on while Mr. Vane gave himself ducal airs to the waiters, and  found fault with the icing of his sparkling hock. There was scarcely any  extravagance which this little girl had not seen her father perpetrate. She had  received from him a birthday present of a two-guinea wax doll, at the very time  at which her schooling account, at a certain humble little seminary near Cheyne  Walk, remained unpaid, and her education was brought to a dead lock by reason  of this default. She had sighed for that golden-haired waxen plaything, and her  father gave it to her because he loved her as he had always loved, weakly and  foolishly.</p>
<p>She loved him in return: repaying him a hundredfold for his  affection by her innocent love and trust. To her he was all that was perfect,  all that was noble and generous. The big talk, the glowing and sentimental  discourse by which he was wont to impose upon himself, imposed upon her. She  believed in that fancy portrait which he painted of himself, and which he  himself believed in as a most faithful and unflattered likeness. She believed  in that highly-coloured picture, and thought that George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane  was indeed what he represented himself, and thought himself to be, an injured  old man, a sainted martyr to the forgetfulness of the world, and the  ingratitude of his children.</p>
<p>Poor Eleanor was never weary of listening to her father&rsquo;s  stories about the Prince Regent, and all the lesser planets of the darkened sky  in which Mr. Vane&rsquo;s light had once shone. She used to walk in the park with the  old man in the sunny summer evenings, proud to see him bow to great people, who  returned his recognition with friendly courtesy. She liked to fancy him in the  days that were gone, riding side by side with those mighty ones of the earth,  whom he was now content to watch wistfully across the iron railings. She was  pleased to stroll in the dusky gloaming of the soft May night, and to look up  at the lights in that princely mansion in Berkeley Square which George Vane had  once occupied. He showed her the windows which had belonged to this and that  apartment, the drawing-room, the first Mrs. Vane&rsquo;s boudoir, the little girls&rsquo;  nursery and morning room. She fancied all those fairy chambers radiant with  light and splendour, and then remembering the shabby rooms at Chelsea, clung closer to her father&rsquo;s arm, in  her tender sorrow for his fallen state.</p>
<p>But she had inherited much of George Vane&rsquo;s sanguine  temperament, and almost as firm as her belief in the past, which had been a  reality, was her confidence in the splendid future, which her father hoped in.  Nothing could have been more shadowy than the foundations upon which Mr. Vane  had built for himself an airy castle. In his youth and middle age his most  intimate friend and companion had been a certain Maurice de Crespigny, the  owner of a noble estate in Berkshire,  and&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;a friend of the Prince Regent&rsquo;s. So, while George  Vane&rsquo;s two estates had melted away, and his three fortunes had been expended,  Mr. de Crespigny, who was an invalid and a bachelor, had contrived to keep his  land and his money.</p>
<p>There was only the difference of two or three years between the  ages of the two friends. I believe that Maurice de Crespigny was the younger of  the two. And it was during their early college life that the young men had  entered into a romantic alliance, very chivalrous and honourable in its nature,  but scarcely likely to stand the wear and tear of worldly experience.</p>
<p>They were to be friends through life and until death. They were  to have no secrets from each other. If by any chance they should happen to fall  in love with the same person&mdash;and I really think these sentimental collegians  rather wished that such a contingency might arise&mdash;one of them, the most noble,  the most heroic, was quietly to fall back and suffer in silence, while the  weaker won the prize. If either died a bachelor, he was to leave his fortune to  the other, whatever less noble and more common-place claimants, in the way of  heirs presumptive, might press upon him.</p>
<p>These vows had been made at least&nbsp;five-and-forty years ago,  but out of this folly of the past George Vane built his hope in the future.  Maurice de Crespigny was now a soured and hypochondriacal old bachelor, shut in  and defended on every side by greedy and sycophantic relations, and utterly  unapproachable to his shabby old bosom friend; who could as easily have made  his way out of one of the lowest dungeons of the Bastille as he could force an  entrance into that closely-guarded citadel within which his college companion  sat, lonely and dismal, a desolate old man, watched over by sharp eyes,  greedily noteful of every token of his decay, ministered to by hands that would  have worked eagerly at his winding-sheet, if by so doing they could have  hastened the hour of his death.</p>
<p>If George Vane&mdash;remembering his old friend, perhaps, with some  latent feeling of tenderness intermingled with his mercenary hopes&mdash;made an  effort to penetrate the cruel barriers about him, he was repulsed with ignominy  by the two maiden nieces who kept watch and ward at Woodlands. If he wrote to  Mr. de Crespigny, his missive was returned unopened, with a satirical  intimation that the dear invalid&rsquo;s health was not in a state to endure the  annoyance of begging letters. He had made a hundred attempts to cross the lines  of the enemy, and had been mortified by a hundred failures; but his sanguine  nature was not to be subdued by any humiliation, and he still believed, firmly  and entirely, that whenever Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s will came to be opened, his  name, and his alone, would appear as sole heir to his old friend&rsquo;s wealth. He  forgot that Maurice de Crespigny was his junior by some two or three years; for  he had always heard of him of late as a feeble invalid tottering upon the verge  of the grave, while he himself was erect and stalwart, broad chested, and  soldierly-looking, so very soldierly in appearance that the sentinels on guard  in the park were wont to salute him as he passed them, believing him to be some  military magnate.</p>
<p>Yes, he believed the day would come when poor De Crespigny&mdash;he  always spoke of his friend with a certain pitiful tenderness&mdash;would drop quietly  into his grave, and when he would reign at Woodlands with his darling Eleanor,  avenging himself upon his ungrateful elder children, reopening accounts with  his old creditors&mdash;in all his visions of grandeur and patronage he never thought  of paying his debts&mdash;and arising from the dull ashes of his poverty, a splendid  ph&oelig;nix, golden plumed and exultant.</p>
<p>He taught his daughter this belief as religiously as he taught  her the simple prayers which she said nightly at his knee. With all his faults  he was no unbeliever, though the time which he devoted to religious observances  made a very small portion of his existence. He taught Eleanor to believe in the  day that was to come, and the little girl saw the light of future splendour  gleaming athwart the dreary swamp of difficulty through which she waded  patiently by her father&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>But the day came when George Vane and his child were to be  separated, for a time at least. Eleanor&rsquo;s twelfth birthday was very near at  hand, and she had as yet received no better education than the rather limited  course of instruction which was to be obtained for a guinea and a half a  quarter at the day school near Cheyne Walk. For nearly six years, inclusive of  many intervals of non-attendance consequent upon non-payment, Miss Vane had  frequented this humble seminary, in company with the daughters of the butchers  and bakers and other plebeian inhabitants of the district; but by the time she  was twelve years old the various sources from which her father&rsquo;s very desultory  income had been drawn had one by one run dry and failed him. The weakest and  most long-suffering of his creditors had crossed his name out of their ledgers;  his friends had ceased to believe in the fiction of delayed remittances, urgent  temporary need, and early repayment, and he could no longer count upon an  occasional five-pound note when the Chelsea landlady became clamorous, and the  Chelsea general dealer refused to send home another ounce of tea, except on  payment of ready money.</p>
<p>A desperate crisis had come, and in his despair the old man  forgot his pride. For Eleanor&rsquo;s sake, if not for his own, he must endure  humiliation. He must appeal to his eldest daughter, the hard-hearted but  wealthy Hortensia Bannister, who had lost her stockbroker husband a twelvemonth  before, and was now a rich and childless widow. Yes&mdash;he wiped the tears of  humiliation away from his faded cheeks as he arrived at this resolution&mdash;he  would try and forget the past, and would take Eleanor with him to Hyde Park  Gardens, and appeal to her cruel sister in her behalf. His determination was  speedily carried out, for he went to work with something of that desperate  courage which a condemned criminal may feel when he goes to execution, and one  sunny morning in the early June of 1850, he and his daughter sat in Mrs.  Bannister&rsquo;s handsome drawing-room, fearfully awaiting the advent of that lady.  She came to them after a very brief delay, for she was business-like and  uncompromising in her habits, and she had been prepared for this visit by a  long, pitiful, explanatory letter from her father, in reply to which she had  written very coldly and concisely, appointing an early interview.</p>
<p>She was a severe-looking woman of about five-and-thirty, with a  hard face, and heavy black eyebrows, which met over her handsome aquiline nose  when she frowned, which she did a great deal too often, poor Eleanor thought.  Her features were like those of her father, but her grim and stony expression  was entirely her own, and was perhaps the result of that early and bitter  disappointment of finding herself a portionless girl, deserted by the man she  loved, who fell away from her when he discovered the state of her father&rsquo;s  fortunes, and compelled to marry for money, or to accept the wretched  alternative of a life of poverty and drudgery.</p>
<p>This harsh, disappointed woman affected no pretence of tender  feeling for her half-sister. Perhaps the sight of Eleanor&rsquo;s childish beauty was  scarcely pleasant to her. She herself had drawn a dreary blank in the great  lottery of life in spite of her wealth, and she may have envied this child her  unknown future, which could not well be so dismal as the childless widow&rsquo;s  empty existence.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Bannister was a religious woman, and tried to do her  duty in a hard, uncompromising way, in which good works were not beautified by  any such flimsy adornments as love and tenderness. So when she heard that her  father lived from day to day a wretched hand-to-mouth existence, haunted by the  grim phantom of starvation, she was seized with a sudden sense that she had  been very wicked to this weak old man, and she agreed to allow him a decent  pittance, which would enable him to live about as comfortably as a half-pay  officer or a small annuitant. She made this concession sternly enough, and  lectured her father so severely that he may be perhaps forgiven if he was not  very grateful for his daughter&rsquo;s bounty, so far as he himself went; but he did  make a feeble protestation of his thankfulness when Mrs. Bannister further  declared her willingness to pay a certain premium in consideration of which  Eleanor Vane might be received in a respectable boarding-school as an  apprentice or pupil teacher.</p>
<p>It was thus that the little girl became acquainted with the  Misses Bennett of Wilmington House, Brixton; and it was in the household of  these ladies that three years of her life had been passed. Three quiet and  monotonous years of boarding-school drudgery, which had only been broken by two  brief visits to her father, who had taken up his abode in Paris; where he lived  secure from the persecution of a few of his latter-day creditors&mdash;not the  west-end tradesmen who had known him in his prime,&nbsp;<i>they</i>&nbsp;were  resigned and patient enough under their losses&mdash;but a few small dealers who had  trusted him in his decline, and who were not rendered lenient by the memory of  former profits.</p>
<p>In Paris,  Mr. Vane had very little chance of obtaining any information about his friend  Maurice de Crespigny, but he still looked forward confidently to that visionary  future in which he was to be master of the Woodlands estate. He had taken care  to write a letter, soon after Eleanor&rsquo;s birth, which had happened to reach his  friend, announcing the advent of this youngest child, and dwelling much on his  love for her. He cherished some visionary notion that, in the event of his  death occurring before that of Maurice de Crespigny, the old man might leave  his wealth to Eleanor. The contumely with which he had been treated by the maiden  harpies who kept watch over his old friend had been pleasant to him rather than  otherwise, for in the anger of these elderly damsels he saw an evidence of  their fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they knew that poor De Crespigny&rsquo;s money was left to them,  they wouldn&rsquo;t be so savage,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident they&rsquo;re by no means too  confident about the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there were other relatives of the old man&rsquo;s, less fortunate  than the maiden sisters, who had found their way into the citadel, and planted  themselves&nbsp;<i>en permanence</i>&nbsp;at Woodlands. There was a married  niece, who had once been a beauty. This lady had been so foolish as to marry  against her rich uncle&rsquo;s wishes, and was now a widow, living in the  neighbourhood of Woodlands upon an income of two hundred a year. This lady&rsquo;s only  son, Launcelot Darrel, was heir-at-law to Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune. But  the maiden sisters were patient and indefatigable women. No sacred fire was  ever watched more carefully by classic vestal than was the ireful flame which  burned in Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s heart when he remembered his married niece&rsquo;s  ingratitude and disobedience. The unwearying old maids kept his indignation  alive by every feminine subtlety, by every diplomatic device. Heaven knows what  they wanted with their uncle&rsquo;s money, for they were prim damsels who wore stuff  shoes and scanty dresses made in the fashion of their youth. They had outlived  the very faculty of enjoyment, and their wants were almost as simple as those  of the robins that perched upon their window-sills; but for all this they were  as eager to become possessors of the old man&rsquo;s wealth as the most heartless and  spend-thrift heir, tormented by Israelitish creditors, and subsisting entirely  upon post obits.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter  4<br>
  Upon The Threshold Of A Great Sorrow</b></h2>
<p>It&nbsp;was nearly noon when Eleanor Vane  awoke upon the morning after her journey, for this young lady was a good  sleeper, and was taking her revenge for four-and-twenty hours of wakefulness. I  doubt, indeed, if she would have opened her eyes when she did, had not her  father tapped at the door of her tiny chamber and told her the hour.</p>
<p>She woke smiling, like a beautiful infant who has always seen  loving eyes watching above its cradle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, darling,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is it you? I&rsquo;ve just been dreaming  that I was at Brixton. How delightful to wake and hear your voice. I won&rsquo;t be  long, papa dear. But you haven&rsquo;t waited breakfast all this time, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear. I have a cup of coffee and a roll brought me every  morning at nine from a&nbsp;<i>traiteur&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;over the way. I&rsquo;ve ordered  some breakfast for you, but I wouldn&rsquo;t wake you till twelve. Dress quickly,  Nell. It&rsquo;s a lovely morning, and I&rsquo;ll take you for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed a lovely morning. Eleanor Vane flung back the  tawdry damask curtains, and let the full glory of the August noontide sun into  her little room. Her window had been open all the night through, and the  entresol was so close to the street that she could hear the conversation of the  people upon the pavement below. The foreign jargon sounded pleasant to her in  its novelty. It was altogether different to the French language as she had been  accustomed to hear it at Brixton; where a young lady forfeited a halfpenny  every time she forgot herself so far as to give utterance to her thoughts or  desires in the commonplace medium of her mother tongue. The merry voices, the  barking of dogs, the rattling of wheels and ringing of bells in the distance  mingled in a cheerful clamour.</p>
<p>As Eleanor Vane let in that glorious noontide sunlight, it  seemed to her that she had let in the morning of a new life; a new and happier  existence, brighter and pleasanter than the dull boarding school monotony she  had had so much of.</p>
<p>Her happy young soul rejoiced in the sunshine, the strange city,  the change, the shadowy hopes that beckoned to her in the future, the  atmosphere of love which her father&rsquo;s presence always made in the shabbiest  home. She had not been unhappy at Brixton, because it was her nature to be  happy under difficulties, because she was a bright, spontaneous creature to  whom it was almost impossible to be sorrowful; but she had looked forward  yearningly to this day, in which she was to join her father in Paris, never  perhaps to go far away from him again. And it had come at last, this  long-hoped-for day, the sunny opening of a new existence. It had come; and even  the heavens had sympathy with her gladness, and wore their fairest aspect in  honour of this natal day of her new life.</p>
<p>She did not linger long over her toilet, though she lost a good  deal of time in unpacking her box&mdash;which had not been very neatly packed, by the  way&mdash;and had considerable trouble in finding hair-brushes and combs, cuffs,  collars, and ribbons, and all the rest of the small paraphernalia with which  she wished to decorate herself.</p>
<p>But when she emerged at last, radiant and smiling, with her long  golden hair falling in loose curls over her shoulders, and her pale muslin  dress adorned with fluttering blue ribbons, her father was fain to cry out  aloud at the sight of his darling&rsquo;s beauty. She kissed him a dozen times, but  took very little notice of his admiration&mdash;she seemed, in fact, scarcely  conscious that he did admire her&mdash;and then ran into the adjoining room to caress  a dog, an eccentric French poodle, which had been George Vane&rsquo;s faithful  companion during the three years he had spent in Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; Eleanor cried joyously, returning to the  sitting-room with the dingy white animal in her arms, &ldquo;I am so pleased to find  Fido. You didn&rsquo;t speak of him in your letters, and I was afraid you had lost  him perhaps, or that he was dead. But here he is, just as great a darling, and  just as dirty as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poodle, who was divided in half, upon that unpleasant  principle common to his species, and who was white and curly in front, and  smooth and pinky behind, reciprocated Miss Vane&rsquo;s caresses very liberally. He  leaped about her knees when she set him down upon the slippery floor, and  yelped wild outcries of delight. He was not permitted to pass the night in Mr.  Vane&rsquo;s apartments, but slept in a dismal outhouse behind the butcher&rsquo;s shop,  and it was thus that Eleanor had not seen him upon her arrival in the Rue  L&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que.</p>
<p>The young lady was so anxious to go out with her father, so  eager to be away on the broad boulevards with the happy idle people of that  wonderful city in which nobody ever seems to be either busy or sorrowful, that  she made very short work of her roll and coffee, and then ran back to her  little bed-chamber to array herself for a promenade. She came out five minutes  afterwards, dressed in a black silk mantle and a white transparent bonnet,  which looked fleecy and cloud-like against her bright auburn hair. That  glorious hair was suffered to fall from under the bonnet and stream about her  shoulders like golden rain, for she had never yet attained the maturer dignity  of wearing her luxuriant tresses plaited and twisted in a hard knot at the back  of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, papa, please, where are we to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever you like, my darling,&rdquo; the old man answered; &ldquo;I mean  to give you a treat to-day. You shall spend the morning how you like, and we&rsquo;ll  dine on the Boulevard Poissonnier. I&rsquo;ve received a letter from Mrs. Bannister.  It came before you were up. I am to call in the Rue de la Paix for a hundred  and six pounds. A hundred to be paid to Madame Marly, and six for me; my  monthly allowance, my dear, at the rate of thirty shillings a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane sighed as he named the sum. It would have been better  for this broken down old spendthrift if he could have received his pittance  weekly, or even daily, for it was his habit to dine at the Trois Fr&egrave;res, and  wear pale straw-coloured gloves, and a flower in his button-hole, at the  beginning of the month, and to subsist on rolls and coffee towards its close.</p>
<p>He unfolded the narrow slip of paper upon which his eldest  daughter had written the banker&rsquo;s address and the amount which Mr. Vane was to  demand, and looked at the magical document fondly, almost proudly. Any one  unfamiliar with his frivolous and sanguine nature, might have wondered at the  change which had taken place in his manner since the previous night, when he  had tearfully bewailed his daughter&rsquo;s cruelty.</p>
<p>He had been an old man then, degraded, humiliated, broken down  by sorrow and shame: to-day he was young, handsome, gay, defiant, pompous,  prepared to go out into the world and hold his place amongst the butterflies  once more. He rejoiced in the delicious sensation of having money to spend.  Every fresh five-pound note was a new lease of youth and happiness to George  Vane.</p>
<p>The father and daughter went out together, and the butcher  neglected his business in order to stare after Miss Vane, and the butcher&rsquo;s  youngest child, a tiny damsel in a cambric mob-cap, cried out, &ldquo;Oh, la belle  demoiselle!&rdquo; as Eleanor turned the corner of the narrow street into the sunny  thoroughfare beyond. Fido came frisking after his master&rsquo;s daughter, and Mr.  Vane had some difficulty in driving the animal back. Eleanor would have liked  the dog to go with them in their noontide ramble through the Parisian streets,  but her father pointed out the utter absurdity of such a proceeding.</p>
<p>Mr. Vane conducted his daughter through a maze of streets behind  the Madeleine. There was no Boulevard Malesherbes in those days, to throw this  part of the city open to the sweep of a park of artillery. Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes lit  up with gladness as they emerged from the narrower streets behind the church  into the wide boulevard, not as handsome then as it is to-day, but very broad  and airy, gay and lightsome withal.</p>
<p>An involuntary cry of delight broke from Eleanor&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is so different from Brixton. But  where are we going first, papa, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the way, my dear, to Blount &amp; Co.&rsquo;s, in the Rue de la  Paix. We&rsquo;ll get this money at once, Nelly, and we&rsquo;ll carry it straight to  Madame Marly. They had no occasion to insult us, my dear. We have not sunk so  low, yet. No, no, not quite so low as to rob our own children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, darling, don&rsquo;t think of that cruel letter. I don&rsquo;t like  to take the money when I remember that. Don&rsquo;t think of it, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;<i>will</i>&nbsp;think of it, my dear,&rdquo; he answered, in  a tone of sorrowful indignation&mdash;the indignation of an honourable man, who  rebels against a cruel stigma of dishonour. &ldquo;I will think of it, Eleanor. I  have been called a thief&mdash;a thief, Eleanor. I am not very likely to forget&nbsp;<i>that</i>,  I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in the Rue de la Paix by this time. George Vane was  very familiar with the banker&rsquo;s office, for he had been in the habit of  receiving his monthly pension through an order on Messrs. Blount &amp; Co. He  left Eleanor at the foot of the stairs, while he ascended to the office on the  first floor; and he returned five minutes afterwards, carrying a bundle of  notes in one hand, and a delicious little roll of napoleons in the other. The  notes fluttered pleasantly in the summer air, as he showed them to his  daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go at once to Madame Marly, my darling,&rdquo; he said,  gaily, &ldquo;and give her these, without a moment&rsquo;s unnecessary delay. They shall  have no justification in calling me a thief, Eleanor. You will write to your  sister by this afternoon&rsquo;s post, perhaps, my dear, and tell her that I did not  try to rob you. I think you owe so much as that to your poor old father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Vane&rsquo;s daughter clung lovingly to his arm, looking up  tenderly and entreatingly in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, darling, how can you say such things,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I will  write and tell Mrs. Bannister that she has been very cruel, and that her  insulting letter has made me hate to take her paltry money. But, papa, dearest,  how can you talk of robbing&nbsp;<i>me</i>. If this money is really mine, take  it, take every penny of it, if&mdash;if&mdash;you owe it to anybody who worries you, or if  you want it for anything in the world. I can go back to Brixton and earn my  living to-morrow, papa. Miss Bennett and Miss Lavinia told me so before I came  away. You don&rsquo;t know how useful they began to find me with the little ones.  Take the money, papa, dear, if you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane turned upon his daughter with almost tragic  indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you know me so little that you dare to  insult me by such a proposition as this? No, if I were starving I would not  take this money. Am I so lost and degraded that even the child I love turns  upon me in my old age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand which held the bank notes trembled with passionate  emotion as the old man spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, darling,&rdquo; Eleanor pleaded, &ldquo;indeed, indeed, I did not  mean to wound you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hear no more of this, then, Eleanor, let me hear no more  of it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Vane, drawing himself up with a dignity that would have  become a toga, rather than the old man&rsquo;s fashionable over-coat. &ldquo;I am not angry  with you, my darling, I was only hurt, I was only hurt. My children have never  known me, Eleanor, they have never known me. Come, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane put aside his tragic air, and plunged into the Rue St.  Honor&eacute;, where he called for a packet of gloves that had been cleaned for him.  He put the gloves in his pocket, and then strolled back into the Rue  Castiglione, looking at the vehicles in the roadway as he went. He was waiting  to select the most elegantly appointed of the hackney equipages crawling slowly  past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity the Government insist on putting a painted badge  upon them,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;When I last called on Madame Marly, Charles  the Tenth was at the Tuileries, and I had my travelling chariot and pair at  Meurice&rsquo;s, besides a Britska for Mrs. Vane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had pitched upon a very new and shining vehicle, with a smart  coachman, by this time, and he made that half hissing, half whistling noise  peculiar to Parisians when they call a hackney carriage.</p>
<p>Eleanor sprang lightly into the vehicle, and spread her flowing  muslin skirts upon the cushions as she seated herself. The passers by looked  admiringly at the smiling young Anglaise with her white bonnet and nimbus of  glittering hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Au Bois, Cocher,&rdquo; Mr. Vane cried, as he took his place by his  daughter.</p>
<p>He had bought a tiny bouquet for his button-hole near the  Madeleine, and he selected a pair of white doeskin gloves, and drew them  carefully on his well-shaped hands. He was as much a dandy to-day as he had been  in those early days when the Prince and Brummel were his exalted models.</p>
<p>The drive across the Place de la Concorde, and along the Champs  Elys&eacute;es, was an exquisite pleasure to Eleanor Vane; but it was even yet more  exquisite when the light carriage rolled away along one of the avenues in the  Bois de Boulogne, where the shadows of the green leaves trembled&nbsp;on the  grass, and all nature rejoiced beneath the cloudless August sky. The day was a  shade too hot, perhaps, and had been certainly growing hotter since noon, but  Eleanor was too happy to remember that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice it is to be with you, papa, darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and  how I wish I wasn&rsquo;t going to this school. I should be so happy in that dear  little lodging over the butcher&rsquo;s, and I could go out as morning governess to  some French children, couldn&rsquo;t I? I shouldn&rsquo;t cost you much, I know, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my love. Your education must be completed. Why should  you be less accomplished than your sisters? You shall occupy as brilliant a position  as ever they occupied, my love, or a better one, perhaps. You have seen me  under a cloud, Eleanor; but you shall see the sunshine yet. You&rsquo;ll scarcely  know your old father, my poor girl, when you see him in the position he has  been used to occupy; yes, used to occupy, my dear. This lady we are going to  see, Madame Marly,&nbsp;<i>she</i>&nbsp;remembers, my love. She could tell you  what sort of a man George Vane was five-and-twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house in which the fashionable school-mistress who had  &ldquo;finished&rdquo; the elder daughters of George Vane still received her pupils, was a  white walled villa, half-hidden in one of the avenues of the Bois   de Boulogne.</p>
<p>The little hired carriage drew up before a door in the garden  wall, and a portress came out to reply to the coachman&rsquo;s summons.</p>
<p>Unhappily, the portress said, Madame was not at home. Madame&rsquo;s  assistants were at home, and would be happy to receive Monsieur and  Mademoiselle. That might be perhaps altogether the same thing, the portress  suggested.</p>
<p>No, Monsieur replied, he must see Madame herself. Ah, but then  nothing could be so unfortunate. Madame, who so seldom quitted the Pension, had  to-day driven into Paris  to arrange her affairs, and would not return until sunset.</p>
<p>Mr. Vane left his card with a few words written upon it in  pencil to the effect that he would call at two o&rsquo;clock the next day, in the  charge of the portress, and the carriage drove back towards Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear witness, Eleanor,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;bear witness that I  tried to pay this money away immediately after receiving it. You will be good  enough to mention that fact in your letter to my eldest daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had carried the notes in his hand all this time, as if eager  to deliver them over to the school-mistress, but he now put them into his  breast-pocket. I think upon the whole he was rather pleased at the idea of  retaining custody of the money for the next twenty-four hours. It was not his  own, but the mere possession of it gave him a pleasant sense of importance; and  again he might very probably have an opportunity of displaying the bank notes,  incidentally, to some of his associates. Unhappily for this lonely old man, his  few Parisian acquaintances were of a rather shabby and not too reputable  calibre, and were therefore likely to be somewhat impressed by the sight of a  hundred and twenty-five napoleons, in crisp, new notes upon the Bank of France.</p>
<p>It was past three when Mr. Vane and his daughter alighted in  front of the Palais Royal, and the coachman claimed payment for two hours and  a-half. The old man had changed the first of his six Napoleons at the  glove-cleaners, and he had a handful of loose silver in his waistcoat pocket,  so the driver was quickly paid and dismissed, and Eleanor entered the Palais  Royal, that paradise of cheap jewellery and dinners, hanging on her father&rsquo;s  arm.</p>
<p>Mr. Vane bore patiently with his daughter&rsquo;s enthusiastic  admiration of the diamonds and the paste, the glittering realities and almost  as glittering shams in the jewellers&rsquo; windows. Eleanor wanted to look at  everything, the trinkets, and opera-glasses, and portmanteaus, and  china,&mdash;everything was new and beautiful. The fountain was playing; noisy  children were running about amongst equally noisy nurses and well-dressed  loungers. A band was playing close to the fountain. The chinking of tea-spoons  and cups and saucers, sounded in the Caf&eacute; de la Rotonde: people had not begun  to dine yet, but the windows and glazed nooks in the doorways of the  restaurants were splendid with their displays of enormous pears and peaches.  George Vane allowed his daughter to linger a long time before all the shops. He  was rather ashamed of her exuberant delight, and unrestrained enthusiasm, as so  much pleasure in these simple things was scarcely consistent with that&nbsp;<i>haut  ton</i>&nbsp;which the old man still affected even in his downfall. But he had  not the heart to interfere with his daughter&rsquo;s happiness&mdash;was it not strange  happiness to him to have this beautiful creature with him, clinging to his arm,  and looking up at him with a face that was glorified by her innocent joy.</p>
<p>They left the Palais Royal at last, before half its delights  were exhausted, as Eleanor thought, and went through the Rue Richelieu to the  Place de la Bourse, where Mr. Vane&rsquo;s eager companion looked wistfully at the  doors of the theatre opposite the great Temple of Commerce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how I should like to go to a theatre  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Vane had seen a good deal of the English drama during her  Chelsea life, for the old man knew some of the London managers, men who  remembered him in his prosperity, and were glad to give him admission to their  boxes now and then, out of pure benevolence. But the Parisian theatres seemed  mysteriously delightful to Eleanor, inasmuch as they were strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get tickets for the theatres here, papa,&rdquo; she asked,  &ldquo;as you used in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my love,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not quite such an easy matter. I  know one of the scene-painters at the Ambigu&mdash;a very clever fellow&mdash;but he  doesn&rsquo;t get many orders to give away. I&rsquo;ll tell you what, though, Eleanor, I&rsquo;ll  take you to the Porte St. Martin to-night&mdash;why should I deny my child an  innocent pleasure&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take you to the Porte St. Martin, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Vane paused, and a gloomy shadow crept over his face&mdash;a  shade that made him look&nbsp;an old man. His youthfulness of appearance  entirely depended upon the buoyancy of a nature which contended with age. The  moment his spirits sank he looked what he was&mdash;an old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what, papa, dearest?&rdquo; Eleanor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I had an appointment for to-night, my love, with&mdash;with a  couple of gentlemen who&mdash;But I won&rsquo;t keep it, Eleanor,&mdash;no, no, I&rsquo;ll not keep it.  I&rsquo;ll take you to the theatre. I can afford you that pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear papa, you never refused me any pleasure; but it  would be so selfish of me to ask you to break your appointment with these two  gentlemen. You had better keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my dear&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;it would be better&mdash;perhaps. Yes, I&rsquo;ll take  you to the Porte St. Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane spoke hesitatingly. The shadow had not yet left his  face. Had his daughter been less occupied by the delights of the Parisian  shops, the novelty and gaiety of the crowd, she must surely have observed the  change in that idolised father.</p>
<p>But she observed nothing, she could remember nothing but her  happiness. This glorious day of reunion and delight seemed indeed the beginning  of a new life. She looked back wonderingly at the dull routine of her  boarding-school existence. Could it be possible that it was only a day or two  since she was in the Brixton school-room hearing the little ones, the  obstinate, incorrigible little ones, their hateful lessons,&mdash;their odious,  monotonous repetitions of dry facts about William the Conquerer and Buenos  Ayres, the manufacture of tallow candles, and the nine parts of speech?</p>
<p>They strolled on the boulevard till six o&rsquo;clock, and then  ascended the shining staircase of a restaurant on the Boulevard Poissonnier,  where Eleanor saw herself reflected in so many mirrors that she was almost  bewildered by the repetition of her own auburn hair and white bonnet.</p>
<p>The long saloons were filled with eager diners, who looked up  from their knives and forks as the English girl went by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dine &agrave; la carte here,&rdquo; her father whispered: &ldquo;this is a f&ecirc;te  day, and I mean to give you a first-class dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane found a vacant table in an open window. The house was  at a corner of the boulevard, and this window looked down the crowded  thoroughfare towards the Madeleine. Eleanor exclaimed once more as the prospect  burst upon her, and she saw all the boulevard with its gay splendour, spread  out, as it were, at her feet; but her father was too busy with the waiter and  the&nbsp;<i>carte</i>&nbsp;to observe her manifestation of delight.</p>
<p>Mr. Vane was an epicure, and prided himself upon his talent for  ordering a dinner. There was a good deal of&nbsp;<i>finesse</i>&nbsp;displayed  by him now-a-days in the arrangement of a repast; for poverty had taught him  all kinds of little diplomatic contrivances whereby he might, as it were,  mingle economy and extravagance. He ordered such and such dishes &ldquo;for one,&rdquo;  intending to divide them with his child. A few Ostend oysters, some soup,&mdash;<i>pur&eacute;e cr&eacute;cy</i>&mdash;a  little dish of beef and olives, a&nbsp;<i>sole normande</i>, a quarter of a  roast chicken, and a&nbsp;<i>Charlotte Plombi&egrave;res</i>.</p>
<p>It was a long time since Eleanor had eaten one of her father&rsquo;s  epicurean feasts, and she did ample justice to the dinner, even in spite of the  ever recurrent distractions upon the boulevard below.</p>
<p>The dishes followed each other slowly, for the unresting waiters  had many claimants on their attention, and the sun was low in the cloudless  western sky when Mr. Vane and his daughter left the restaurant. It was nearly  night; the lights began to shine out through a hot white mist, for the heat had  grown more and more oppressive as the day had declined. The Parisians sitting  at little marble tables on the pavement outside the caf&eacute;s fanned themselves  with their newspapers, and drank effervescing drinks pertinaciously. It was a  night upon which one should have had nothing more laborious to do than to sit  outside Tortoni&rsquo;s and eat ices.</p>
<p>The noise and clamour, the oppressive heat, the bustle and  confusion of the people rushing to the theatres made Eleanor&rsquo;s head ache. One  cannot go on being unutterably happy for ever, and perhaps the day&rsquo;s excitement  had been almost too much for this young school-girl. She had walked long  distances already upon the burning asphalte of the wonderful city, and she was  beginning to be tired. Mr. Vane never thought of this: he had been accustomed  to walk about day after day, and sometimes all day, for what should a lonely  Englishman do in Paris  but walk about? and he forgot that the fatigue might be too much for his  daughter. He walked on, therefore, with Eleanor still clinging to his arm, past  the Ambigu, beyond the Barri&egrave;re St. Antoine, and still the long, lamp-lit  boulevard stretched before them, away into immeasurable distance as it appeared  to Miss Vane.</p>
<p>The hot white mist seemed to grow denser as the evening  advanced; the red sun blazed and flashed on every available scrap of crystal;  the gas-lamps, newly illumined, strove against that fast fading sun. It was all  light, and heat, and noise, and confusion, Eleanor thought, upon the boulevard.  Very splendid, of course, but rather bewildering. She would have been glad to  sit down to rest upon one of the benches on the edge of the pavement; but, as  her father did not seem tired, she still walked on, patiently and  uncomplainingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go into one of the theatres presently, Nelly,&rdquo; Mr. Vane  said.</p>
<p>He had recovered his spirits under the invigorating influence of  a bottle of Cliquot&rsquo;s champagne, and the gloomy shadow had quite passed away  from his face.</p>
<p>It was nearly nine o&rsquo;clock, and quite dark, when they turned  towards the Madeleine again, on their way back to the Porte St. Martin. They  had not gone far when Mr. Vane stopped, suddenly confronted by two young men  who were walking arm-in-arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; one of them cried in French, &ldquo;you have served us a  handsome trick, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Vane stammered out an apology. His daughter had returned  from school, he said, and he wished to show her Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; the Frenchman answered; &ldquo;but&nbsp;we were aware of  Mademoiselle&rsquo;s return, and it was arranged in spite of that that we should meet  this evening: was it not so, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to his companion, who nodded rather sulkily, and  turned away with a half weary, half dissatisfied air.</p>
<p>Eleanor looked at the two young men, wondering what new friends  her father had made in Paris.  The Frenchman was short and stout, and had a fair, florid complexion. Eleanor  was able to see this, for his face was turned to the lamplight, as he talked to  her father. He was rather showily dressed, in fashionably cut clothes, that  looked glossy and new, and he twirled a short silver-headed cane in his gloved  hands.</p>
<p>The other man was tall and slender, shabbily and untidily  dressed in garments of a rakish cut, that hung loosely about him. His hands  were thrust deep in the pockets of his loose overcoat, and his hat was slouched  over his forehead.</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane only caught one passing glimpse of this man&rsquo;s face  as he turned sulkily away; but she could see the glimmer of a pair of bright,  restless black eyes under the shadow of his hat, and the fierce curve of a very  thick black moustache, which completely concealed his mouth. He had turned, not  towards the lighted shop windows, but to the roadway; and he was amusing  himself by kicking a wisp of straw to and fro upon the sharp edge of the  curbstone, with the toe of his shabby patent leather boot.</p>
<p>The Frenchman drew George Vane aside, and talked to him for a few  minutes in an undertone, gesticulating after the manner of his nation, and  evidently persuading the old man to do something or other which he shrank from  doing. But Mr. Vane&rsquo;s resistance seemed of a very feeble nature, and the  Frenchman conquered, for his last shrug was one of triumph. Eleanor, standing  by herself, midway between the sulky young man upon the curbstone and her  father and the Frenchman, perceived this. She looked up anxiously as Mr. Vane  returned to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; the old man said, hesitatingly, nervously trifling  with his glove as he spoke; &ldquo;do you think you could find your way back to the  Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find my way back? Why, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I mean, could you find your way back a&mdash;alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She echoed the word with a look of mingled disappointment and  alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here the Frenchman interposed eagerly.</p>
<p>Nothing was more simple, he said; Mademoiselle had only to walk  straight on to the Rue Neuve des Petits Champs; she would then, and then&mdash;</p>
<p>He ran off into a string of rapid directions, not one of which  Eleanor heard. She was looking at her father, Heaven knows how earnestly, for  she saw in his face, in his nervous, hesitating manner, something that told her  there was some sinister influence to be dreaded from this garrulous, eager  Frenchman and his silent companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, dear,&rdquo; she said, in a low, almost imploring voice, &ldquo;do  you really wish me to go back alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, you see, my dear, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t exactly wish&mdash;but there are  appointments which, as Monsieur remarks, not&mdash;not unreasonably, should not be  broken, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will stay out late, papa, perhaps, with these gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my love, no, no; for an hour or so; not longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor looked up sorrowfully in the face she loved so dearly.  Vague memories of grief and trouble in the past, mingled with as vague a  presentiment of trouble in the future, filled her mind: she clasped her hands  imploringly upon her father&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come home with me to-night, papa,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is my first  night at home. Come back, and we&rsquo;ll play&nbsp;<i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>&nbsp;as we used at Chelsea. You remember  teaching me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vane started, as if the tender grasp upon his arm had stung  into his flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t come home to-night, Eleanor. At least, not for an  hour. There&mdash;there are social laws, my dear, which must be observed; and  when&mdash;when a gentleman is asked to give another his revenge, he&mdash;he can&rsquo;t refuse.  I&rsquo;ll put you into a carriage, my darling, if you think you can&rsquo;t find your  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, papa dear, it&rsquo;s not that. I can find my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman here interposed for the second time with some  complimentary speech, addressed to Eleanor, who very imperfectly understood its  purport. He had slipped his arm through that of George Vane, taking possession  of him in a manner by that friendly gesture. In all this time the other man had  never stirred from his sulky attitude upon the edge of the pavement.</p>
<p>Mr. Vane took his daughter&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I can&rsquo;t take you to the theatre, my love,&rdquo; he said,  in the same hesitating manner, &ldquo;I&mdash;I regret that you should be disappointed,  but&mdash;good night, my dear, good night. I shall be home by eleven; but don&rsquo;t sit  up for me; don&rsquo;t on any account sit up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed her hand, held it for a few moments, as if scarcely  knowing what to do with it, and then suddenly dropped it with something of a  guilty manner.</p>
<p>The Frenchman, with his arm still linked in the old man&rsquo;s,  wheeled sharply round, and walked away towards the Barri&egrave;re Saint Antoine,  leaving Eleanor standing alone amongst the passers-by, looking wistfully after  her father. The other man looked up as the Frenchman led Mr. Vane away, and  slowly followed them, with his head bent and his hands in his pockets. Eleanor  stood quite still, watching her father&rsquo;s erect figure, the short Frenchman, and  the tall, sulky stranger following the other two, until all three were out of  sight. Then turning homewards with a half-repressed sigh, she looked sadly down  the long lamplit vista. It was very beautiful, very gay, brilliant, and  splendid; but all that splendour and gaiety made her feel only the more lonely,  now that her father had left her. The first day, the natal day of her new life,  seemed to end very drearily, after all.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter  5<br>
  Waiting</b></h2>
<p>Miss Vane&nbsp;walked very slowly homeward  through the hot, breathless summer night. She was too sorrowful, too much  depressed by the sudden disappointment which had fallen like a dark shadow upon  the close of the day which had begun so brightly, to be embarrassed by any  uncomfortable sense of her loneliness in the crowded thoroughfare.</p>
<p>No one molested or assailed her&mdash;she walked serene in her youth  and innocence; though the full radiance of the lamplight rarely fell upon her  face without some passing glance of admiration resting there also. She never  once thought that her father had done wrong in leaving her to walk alone  through that crowded Parisian    street. In the unselfishness of her loving nature  she scarcely remembered her disappointment about the theatre: not even when she  passed the brilliantly lighted edifice, and looked, a little wistfully perhaps,  at the crowd upon the threshold.</p>
<p>She was uneasy and unhappy about her father, because in all her Chelsea experiences she  remembered evil to have resulted from his going out late at night; vague and  mysterious trouble, the nature of which he had never revealed to her, but whose  effects had haunted him and depressed him for many dreary days. He had been  sometimes, indeed, very often, poorer after a late absence from his shabby Chelsea lodging; he had  been now and then richer; but he had always been alike remorseful and miserable  after those occasional nights of dissipation.</p>
<p>His daughter was sorrowful therefore after parting with him.  She knew that, in spite of his declaration that he would be home at eleven, it  would be between one and two in the morning when he returned; not tipsy&mdash;no,  thank Heaven, he was no drunkard&mdash;but with a nervous, wretched, half- demented  manner, which was perhaps more sad to see than any ordinary intoxication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in hopes papa would always stay at home with me now that  I am grown up,&rdquo; the young lady thought very sadly. &ldquo;When I was little, of  course it was different; I couldn&rsquo;t amuse him. Though we were very happy  sometimes then; and I could play&nbsp;<i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>, or cribbage, or whist with  two dummies. If I can get on very well with my education at Madame Marly&rsquo;s, and  then get a situation as morning governess for a large salary&mdash;morning  governesses do get high salaries sometimes&mdash;how happy papa and I might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her spirits revived under the influence of cheering thoughts  such as these. I have said before that it was scarcely possible for her to be  long unhappy. Her step grew lighter and faster as she walked homeward. The  glory of the gas lights brightened with the brightening of her hopes. She no  longer felt her loneliness in the indifferent crowd. She began to linger now  and then before some of the most attractive of the shops, with almost the same  intense rapture and delight that she had felt in the morning.</p>
<p>She was standing before a book-stall, or rather an open shop  perhaps, reading the titles of the paper-covered romances with the full glare  of the shadeless gas lights on her face, when she was startled by a loud,  hearty English voice, which exclaimed without one murmur of warning or  preparation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that this tall young woman with the golden curls,  is Miss Eleanor Vandeleur Vane, of Regent  Gardens, King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea,  London,  Middlesex. Please don&rsquo;t tell me anything of the kind, for I can&rsquo;t possibly  believe anybody but Jack-and-the-beanstalk could have grown at such a rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane turned round with her face lit up with smiles to  greet this noisy gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick,&rdquo; she cried, putting both her hands into the broad  palm held out before her, &ldquo;is it really you? Who would have thought of seeing  you in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or you, Miss Vane? We heard you were at school at Brixton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dick,&rdquo; the young lady answered; &ldquo;but I have come home now.  Papa lives here, you know, and I am going to a finishing school in the Bois de Boulogne, and then I am going to be a morning  governess, and live with papa always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a great deal too pretty for a governess,&rdquo; said the  young man, looking admiringly at the bright face lifted up to him; &ldquo;your  mistress would snub you. Miss Vane, you&rsquo;d better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try our shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, be a scene-painter, Dick?&rdquo; cried Eleanor, laughing. &ldquo;It  would be funny for a woman to be a scene-painter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Miss Vane. But nobody talked of scene-painting. You  don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d ask you to stand on the top of a ladder to put in skies and  backgrounds, do you? There are other occupations at the Royal Waterloo Ph&oelig;nix  besides scene-painting. But I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you about that: I know how  savage your poor old dad used to be when we talked of the Ph&oelig;nix. What do you  think I am over here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re doing a great drama in eight acts and thirty-two  tableaux at the Porte St. Martin, Raoul l&rsquo;Empoisonneur it&rsquo;s called, Ralph the  Poisoner, and I&rsquo;m over here to pick up the music, sketch the scenery and  effects, and translate the play. Something like versatility there, I think, for  five-and-thirty shillings a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Richard, you were always so clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure; it runs in the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Signora, she is well, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well; the teaching goes on&nbsp;<i>tant bon que mauvais</i>,  as our friends over here say. The Clementi is a little thinner in tone than  when you heard it last, and a little further off concert pitch; but as most of  my aunt&rsquo;s pupils sing flat, that&rsquo;s rather an advantage than otherwise. But  where&nbsp;are you going, Miss Vane? because, wherever it is, I&rsquo;d better see  you there. If we stand before this book-stall any longer, the proprietor may  think we&rsquo;re going to buy something, and as the Parisians don&rsquo;t seem a buying  people, the delusion might be too much for his nerves. Where shall I take you,  Miss Vane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que, if you please, behind the Madeleine.  Do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than I know myself. Miss V. The Signora lived in that  direction when I was a boy. But how is it that you are all alone in the streets  at this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa had an appointment with two gentlemen, and he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he left you to walk home alone. Then he still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still what, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man had stopped hesitatingly, and looking furtively at  Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He still stays out late at night sometimes: a bad habit. Miss  Vane. I was in hopes he would have been cured of it by this time; especially as  there are no dens in the Palais Royal, now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No dens in the Palais Royal,&rdquo; cried Eleanor. &ldquo;What do you  mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my dear Miss Nelly, except that Paris used to be a very wild and wicked  place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no. Our modern Lutetia is a very paradise of innocent  delights, whose citizens enjoy themselves virtuously under the sheltering  dictatorialism of a paternal government. You don&rsquo;t understand me&mdash;well, never  mind, you are still the bright-faced child you were in the King&rsquo;s Road,  Chelsea, only taller and prettier&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Vane had taken her companion&rsquo;s arm, and they were walking  away towards the Madeleine by this time; the young lady clinging to her new  friend almost as confidingly as she had done to her father.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the confidence was misplaced. This young man, with  the loud voice and the somewhat reckless manner, was only assistant  scene-painter and second violin player at a transpontine theatre. He was bound  by no tie of relationship to the beautiful girl hanging upon his arm. Indeed,  his acquaintance with Mr. Vane and his daughter had been of that accidental and  desultory kind out of which the friendships of poor people generally arise.</p>
<p>The young man had lodged with his aunt in the same house that  for nearly six years had sheltered the proud old spendthrift and his motherless  child, and some of Eleanor&rsquo;s earliest memories were of Signora Piccirillo and  her nephew Richard Thornton. She had received her first lessons upon the  pianoforte from the kind Signora, whose Neapolitan husband had died years and  years before, leaving her nothing but an Italian name, which looked very  imposing at the top of the circulars which the music-mistress was wont to  distribute amongst her pupils.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton, at eight-and-twenty, seemed a very elderly  person in the eyes of the school-girl of fifteen. She could remember him years,  and years, and years ago, as it seemed to her, sitting in his shirt sleeves  through the long summer afternoons, under the shadow of the scarlet runners in  the little garden at Chelsea,  smoking dirty clay pipes and practising popular melodies upon his fiddle. Her  father had thought him a nuisance, and had been lofty and reserved in his  patronage of the young man; but to Eleanor, Dick had been the most delightful  of playfellows, the wisest of counsellors, the most learned of instructors.  Whatever Richard did. Miss Vane insisted upon also doing, humbly following the  genius she admired, with little toddling steps, along the brilliant pathway his  talents adorned.</p>
<p>I am afraid she had learned to play &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Rory O&rsquo;More,&rdquo; upon Richard&rsquo;s violin, before she had mastered Haydn&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Surprise,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman?&rdquo; upon the Signora&rsquo;s shabby old grand  piano. She smeared her pinafores with poor Dick&rsquo;s water-colours, and insisted  upon producing replicas of the young scene-painter&rsquo;s sketches, with all the  houses lopsided, and the trunks of all the trees gouty. If Dick kept rabbits or  silkworms, there was no greater happiness for Miss Vane than to accompany him  to Covent Garden market in quest of cabbage or  mulberry leaves. I do not mean that she ever deserted her father for the  society of her friend; but there were times when Mr. Vane absented himself from  his little girl; long days, in which the old man strolled about the streets of  the West-end, on the look-out for the men he had known in his prosperity, with  the hope of borrowing a pound or two, or a handful of loose silver, for the  love of Auld Lang Syne; and longer nights, in which the old man disappeared  from the Chelsea lodging for many dreary hours.</p>
<p>Then it was that Eleanor Vane was thrown into the companionship  of the Signora and her nephew. Then it was that she read Richard&rsquo;s books and  periodicals, that she revelled in &ldquo;Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; and gloated over &ldquo;Wagner,  the Wehr Wolf.&rdquo; Then it was that she played upon the young man&rsquo;s violin, and  copied his pictures, and destroyed his water-colours, and gorged his rabbits  and silkworms, and loved and tormented, and admired him, after the manner of  some beautiful younger sister, who had dropped from the clouds to be his  companion.</p>
<p>This is how these two stood towards each other. They had not met  for three years until to-night, and in the interim Miss Eleanor Vane had grown  from a hoyden of twelve into a tall, slender young damsel of fifteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were so altered, Miss Vane,&rdquo; Richard said, as they walked  along the boulevard, &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t help wondering how it was I knew you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not altered a bit, Dick,&rdquo; answered the young lady,  &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t call me Miss Vane&mdash;it sounds as if you were laughing at me. Call me  Nell, as you used to do, at Chelsea.  Do you know, Dick, I contrived to go to Chelsea  once last summer. It was against papa&rsquo;s wish, you know, that I should let them  find out where I came from at Brixton; because, you see, Chelsea, or at least  the King&rsquo;s Road, sounds vulgar, papa thought. Indeed, I believe he said he  lived in Cadogan Place,  when the Miss Bennetts asked&nbsp;him the question. He explained it to me  afterwards, you know, poor dear; and it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a story, for he had  lodged there for a fortnight once, just after his marriage with mamma, and when  he was beginning to get poor. So I was obliged to manage so cleverly to get to  Regent&rsquo;s Gardens, Dick, and when I did get there you were gone, and the  Signora&rsquo;s rooms were to let, and there was a nasty cross old woman in our  lodgings, and the scarlet runners in the garden were so neglected, and I saw  your rabbit-hutches, all broken and forgotten in the corner by the dust-hole,  but the rabbits were gone. The dear old place seemed so changed, Dick, though  Mr. and Mrs. Migson were very kind, and very pleased to see me, but they  couldn&rsquo;t tell me where you and the Signora were living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we moved two or three times after leaving Regent&rsquo;s Gardens.  You see we&rsquo;re obliged to study the pupils, Nell, rather than our own  convenience. Chelsea  was a long way from the Waterloo Ph&oelig;nix, in spite of the short cuts; but  wherever the Signora&rsquo;s pupils are thickest, we&rsquo;re obliged to pitch our tents.  They&rsquo;re thickest about Tottenham-court    Road and Euston    Square way now: so we&rsquo;re living in the Pilasters, Dudley Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pilasters! That sounds quite grand, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;<i>Magnifique et pas cher</i>. We&rsquo;ve a  chimney-sweep next door but one, and no end of mangles. The Pilasters would be  very nice, if we&rsquo;d two sides of the way, but unfortunately we haven&rsquo;t; the  other side&rsquo;s stables. It isn&rsquo;t my prejudices make me object to that; but the  grooms make such an abominable noise cleaning down their horses, and I wake  every morning out of a dream in which it&rsquo;s Boxing-night, and my transformation  scene is getting the goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man laughed cheerily, and guided his companion across  the road to the other side of the boulevard. It was past ten o&rsquo;clock when they  reached the corner of the Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que, and the butcher&rsquo;s shop was closed.</p>
<p>Eleanor knew that she had only to push open the little side  door, and that she would find the key of her father&rsquo;s rooms in the custody of  the butcher&rsquo;s wife. She was very tired, almost ready to drop, poor girl, for  she had walked a long way since alighting at the Palais Royal with her father;  but she was almost sorry that she had reached her destination. The sense of her  loneliness returned, now that she was to part with her old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for seeing me home, Dick,&rdquo; she said,  shaking hands with the young scene-painter. &ldquo;It was very selfish of me to bring  you so far out of your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selfish of you! Why, you don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d let you prowl about  the streets by yourself, Nell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s face flushed as her friend said this: there was a  reproach to her father implied in the speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my own fault that I was so late,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was only  just nine when papa left me; but I loitered a little, looking at the shops. I  shall see you again, Dick, I hope. But of course I shall, for you&rsquo;ll come and  see papa, won&rsquo;t you? How long do you stay in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a week, I suppose. I&rsquo;ve a week&rsquo;s leave of absence, and  double salary, besides my expenses. They know the value of a clever man at the  Ph&oelig;nix, Miss Vane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are you staying, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the H&ocirc;tel des Deux Mondes, near the markets. I&rsquo;ve an  apartment in convenient proximity to the sky, if I want to study atmospheric  effects. And so you live here, Nell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those are our windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor pointed to the open sashes of the entresol: the fluffy  worsted curtains were drawn, but the windows were wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expect your papa home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock at the latest,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton sighed. He remembered Mr. Vane&rsquo;s habits, and he  remembered that the little girl in pinafores had been wont to keep abnormal  hours in her long watches for her father&rsquo;s coming. He had often found her, on  his return from the transpontine theatre at one or two o&rsquo;clock, with the door  of the little sitting-room ajar, waiting patiently for the old man&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t sit up for your papa, Nell,&rdquo; he said, as he shook  hands with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, papa told me not to sit up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, then. You look tired, Nell. I&rsquo;ll call to-morrow,  and I&rsquo;ll take you to the theatre, if your papa will let you go, and you shall  see &lsquo;Raoul l&rsquo;Empoisonneur.&rsquo; Such a scene, Nell, in the seventh act. The stage  divided into eight compartments, with eight different actions going on  simultaneously, and five murders before the fall of the curtain. It&rsquo;s a great  piece, and ought to make Spavin and Cromshaw&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yours, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Cromshaw will shake me by the hand in that delightful,  gentlemanly manner of his: and Spavin&mdash;why Spavin will give me a five-pound note  for my adaptation of &lsquo;Raoul,&rsquo; and tell every member of the company, in  confidence, that all the great scenes have been written in by him, and that the  piece was utter rubbish till he reconstructed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Richard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Nell, poorer than the gentleman who wrote the almanack, I  dare say. But never mind, Nell. I don&rsquo;t think the game of life pays for much  expenditure in the way of illumination. I think the wisest people are those who  take existence easily. Spavin&rsquo;s wealth can&rsquo;t give him anything better than  diamond studs and a phaeton. The virtuous peasant, Nell, who can slap his  chest, and defy his enemies to pick a hole in his green baize jerkin, gets the  best of it in the long run, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wish you were rich, Dick, for the Signora&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;  Eleanor said, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, Nelly. I wish I was lessee of the Ph&oelig;nix, and I&rsquo;d  bring you out as Juliet, with new palace arches for the ball-room, and a  lime-light in the balcony scene. But, good night, my dear; I mustn&rsquo;t keep you  standing here, like this, though parting is such sweet sorrow, that I really  shouldn&rsquo;t have the heart to go away to-night if I didn&rsquo;t mean to call  to-morrow. That line&rsquo;s rather longer than the original, Nell, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane laughed heartily at her old&nbsp;friend&rsquo;s random  talk, as she wished him good night. All the light-heartedness of her careless  childhood seemed to return to her in Richard Thornton&rsquo;s society. Her childhood  had not been an unhappy one, remember; for in all her father&rsquo;s troubles, he had  so contrived as to keep his head above water, somehow or other, and the  influence of his over-sanguine spirit had kept Eleanor bright and hopeful under  every temporary cloud in the domestic sky.</p>
<p>But the sense of her loneliness came back as she pushed open the  door and entered the dark passage at the side of the shop. The butcher&rsquo;s wife  came out at the sound of her footstep, and gave her the key, with some kindly  word of greeting which Eleanor scarcely understood.</p>
<p>She could only say, &ldquo;Bon soir, madame,&rdquo; in her school-girl  French, as she dragged herself slowly up the little winding stair, thoroughly  worn out, physically and mentally, by this time.</p>
<p>The little entresol seemed terribly close and stifling. She drew  back the curtains, and looked out through the open window, but even the street  itself seemed oppressively hot in the moonless, airless August night.</p>
<p>Eleanor found half a wax candle in a flat china candlestick, and  a box of matches, set ready for her. She lighted this candle, and then flung  off her bonnet and mantle, before she sat down near the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have a very short time to wait, if papa comes home at  eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Alas! she remembered in her old childish experiences, that he  had never come home at the promised hour. How often, ah, how often, she had  waited, counting the weary hours upon the church clocks,&mdash;there was one which  chimed the quarters; and trembling sometimes at those strange sounds which  break the night silence of every house. How often she had &ldquo;hoped against hope,&rdquo;  that he might, for this once, return at the time he had promised.</p>
<p>She took the candle in her hand and looked about for a book. She  wanted to wile away the dreary interval which she knew must elapse before her  father&rsquo;s return. She found a novel of Paul F&eacute;val&rsquo;s, in a dirty and tattered  cover, on the little marble-topped writing-table. The leaves were crumpled, and  smeared with stains and splotches of grease, for it was Mr. Vane&rsquo;s habit to  amuse himself with a work of fiction while he took his matutinal roll and  coffee. He had taken to novel reading in his frivolous old age, and was as fond  of a sentimental story as any school-girl,&mdash;as his daughter herself.</p>
<p>Miss Vane drew the lumbering little table to the open window,  and sat down before it, with her candle close to her elbow, and the tattered  book spread out before her. No breath of air flickered the flame of her candle,  or ruffled the golden hair swept back from her brow.</p>
<p>The passers-by upon the opposite side of the street&mdash;they were  few and far between by this time&mdash;looked up at the lighted window, and saw a  pretty picture by the dim glimmer of that solitary candle. The picture of a  girl, serene in her youth and innocence, bending over her book: her pale muslin  dress and yellow hair faintly visible in the subdued light.</p>
<p>The rattle of wheels and the cries of coachmen sounded far off  upon the Boulevard, and in the Rue de Rivoli, and only made the silence more  palpable in the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que. Now and then a carriage came into that  quiet corner, and Eleanor Vane looked up from her book, breathless, eager,  expectant, fondly hoping that her father might have come back to her in some  hired vehicle; but the solitary carriage always rolled away, until the sound of  its wheels mixed with the rattle of the distant wheels upon the Boulevards.</p>
<p>There were clocks in the distance that struck the quarters. How  long those quarters seemed! Paul F&eacute;val was very interesting no doubt. There was  an awful mystery in those greasy tattered pages; a ghastly mystery about two  drowned young women, treacherously made away with, as it seemed, upon the shore  of a dreary river overshadowed by willows. There were villains and rascals  paramount throughout this delightful romance; and there was mystery and murder  enough for half a dozen novels. But Eleanor&rsquo;s thoughts wandered away from the  page. The dreary river-bank, and the ghostly pollard-willows, the drowned young  women, and the ubiquitous villain, all mingled themselves with her anxious  thoughts about her father; and the trouble in the book seemed to become a part  of the trouble in her own mind, adding its dismal weight to her anxieties.</p>
<p>There were splotchy engravings scattered here and there through  the pages of Monsieur F&eacute;val&rsquo;s romance, and Eleanor fancied by-and-by that the  villain in these pictures was like the sulky stranger who had followed her  father and the Frenchman away towards the Barri&egrave;re Saint Antoine.</p>
<p>She fancied this, although she had scarcely seen that silent  stranger&rsquo;s face. He had kept it, as it seemed, purposely averted, and she had  only caught one glimpse of the restless black eyes under the shadow of his hat,  and the thick moustache that shrouded his mouth. There is always something  mysterious and unpleasant in the idea of anything that has been hidden from us,  however trivial and insignificant that thing may be. Eleanor Vane, growing more  and more nervous as the slow hours crept away, began to worry herself with the  vivid recollection of that one brief glimpse in which she had seen the silent  stranger&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cannot have a good countenance,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;or the  recollection of it would not make me so uncomfortable. How rude he was, too! I  did not much like the Frenchman, but at least he was polite. The other man was  very disagreeable. I hope he is not a friend of papa&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And then she returned  to the drowned young women, and the water-side, and the willows; trying in vain  to bury herself in the romance, and not to listen so eagerly for the striking  of the quarters. Sometimes she thought, &ldquo;Before I turn over to the next page,  papa will be home,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Before I can finish this chapter I shall hear his step  upon the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breathless though the night was, there were many sounds that  disturbed and mocked this&nbsp;anxious watcher. Sometimes the door below  shook&mdash;as if by some mysterious agency, there being no wind&mdash;and Eleanor fancied  that her father&rsquo;s hand was on the latch. Sometimes the stairs creaked, and she  started from her chair, eager to run and receive him, and firmly believing that  he was stealing stealthily up to his apartments, anxious not to disturb the  sleepers. She had known his cautious footfall sound exactly thus in her old  days&rsquo; midnight watches.</p>
<p>But all these sounds were only miserable delusions. Quarter  after quarter, each quarter longer than the last, hour after hour, struck from  the clocks distant and near. The rattling of the wheels upon the Boulevards had  died gradually away, and at last had ceased altogether.</p>
<p>It was long past four, and Eleanor had pushed aside her book  altogether. It was daylight,&mdash;grey, cold, morning, chill and dismal after the  oppressive August night, and she stood now in the window watching the empty  street.</p>
<p>But still the quarters chimed from the distant clocks; those  distant chimes had become terribly distinct now in the early morning stillness.  But the silence was not long-lived. The rumble of waggon wheels sounded far  away in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;. The rush and clatter of a detachment of cavalry clashed  upon the asphalte of the Place de la Concorde. The early sound of a horn called  out some wretched recruits to perform their morning exercise in the court-yards  of the Louvre. The cheerful voices of workpeople echoed in the streets, dogs  were barking, birds singing, the yellow sun mounting in a cloudless heaven.</p>
<p>But there were no signs of the coming of George Vane with the  morning sunlight, and as the day grew older and brighter, the anxious face of  the pale watcher at the open window only grew paler and more anxious.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter  6<br>
  The Black Building By The River</b></h2>
<p>Richard Thornton&nbsp;was by no means an early riser. He  was generally one of the last of those gentlemen who shuffled into the  orchestra at the ten o&rsquo;clock rehearsal of a new melodrama, in which all the  effect of a murder or an abduction depended upon the pizzicato twittering of  violins, and the introduction of explosive chords at particular crises in the  action of the piece. Mr. Thornton was a sluggard, who complained most bitterly  of the heartlessness of stage-managers and prompter&rsquo;s minions in the shape of  unresting call-boys, who seemed to take a malicious delight in nailing cruel  slips of paper to the door-post of the Ph&oelig;nix; terrible mandates, wherein the  Full Band was called at ten; &ldquo;no ten minutes;&rdquo; the meaning of this last  mysterious clause being that the ten minutes&rsquo; grace which is usually accorded  to the tardy performer shall on this occasion be cut off and done away with.</p>
<p>But Richard was out for a holiday now. The eyes of Messrs.  Spavin and Cromshaw would fain have followed him in his Parisian wanderings, to  see that he did double work for his double wage; but the proprietors of the  Royal Waterloo Ph&oelig;nix not being blest with the gift of clairvoyance, Mr.  Thornton defied and snapped his fingers at them, secure in the consciousness of  his own value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If J. T. Jumballs, the author of all the original dramas  they&rsquo;ve done at the Ph&oelig;nix for the last ten years, understood French, he&rsquo;d do  &lsquo;Raoul&rsquo; for two pound ten,&rdquo; thought Richard, as he stood before his  looking-glass in the blazing August sunshine, rubbing his chin contemplatively  and wondering whether the bristles would be too strong if he let them stop till  another morning.</p>
<p>If the honest truth is to be recorded, it must be acknowledged  that Mr. Thornton was by no means too scrupulous in the performance of his  toilet. He had a habit of forgetting to shave until his chin was covered by an  appearance of red stubble, dappled here and there by patches of blue and brown,  for his beard was wont to crop up in unexpected hues, which surprised even  himself. He sympathised with the great lexicographer in not having any  overstrained partiality for clean linen, and, indeed, usually wore a coloured  shirt, the bosom of which was arabesqued with stray splashes of whitewash and  distemper, to say nothing of occasional meandering evidences of the numerous  pints of porter imbibed by the young artist during his day&rsquo;s labour. When Mr.  Thornton bought a new suit of clothes he put them on, and wore them  continuously, and ate and drank and painted in them until they were so worn and  frayed, and enfeebled by ill treatment, that they began to drop away from him  in rusty fragments like the withered leaves which fall from a sturdy young oak.  There were people who declared that Mr. Thornton slept in his ordinary costume,  but of course this was a cruel slander.</p>
<p>To walk eight or nine miles a-day to and fro between the place  of your abode and the scene of your occupation; to paint the best part of the  scenery for a large theatre in which new pieces are brought out pretty  frequently; to play second fiddle, and attend early rehearsals upon cold  mornings; to jot down the music cues in a melodrama, or accompany Mr. Grigsby  in his new comic song, or Madame Rosalbini in her latest cachuca, and to adapt  a French drama, now and then, by way of adding a few extra pounds to your  income, is not exactly to lead an idle life: so perhaps poor Richard Thornton  may be forgiven if his friends had occasion to laugh at his indifference upon  the subject of soap and water. They even went so far as to call him &ldquo;Dirty  Dick,&rdquo; in their more facetious moments; but I don&rsquo;t think the obnoxious  soubriquet wounded Richard&rsquo;s feelings. Everybody liked him and respected him as  a generous-hearted, genial-tempered, honourable-minded fellow, who would  scarcely have told a lie to save his life, and who scorned to drink a pint of  beer that he couldn&rsquo;t pay for, or to accept a favour which he didn&rsquo;t mean to  return.</p>
<p>People at the Ph&oelig;nix knew that Richard Thornton&rsquo;s father had  been a gentleman, and that the young man had a certain pride of his own. He was  the only man in the theatre who neither abused nor flattered his employers. The  carpenters and gasmen touched their caps when they talked to him, though he was  shabbier than any of those&nbsp;<i>employ&eacute;s;</i>&nbsp;the little ballet girls  were fond of him, and came to tell him their troubles when the&nbsp;cruel  stage-manager had put their names down for shilling fines in a horrible book  which was to be seen on the treasury table every Saturday morning. The old  cleaners of the theatre told Mr. Thornton about their rheumatic knee-joints,  and came to him for sympathy after dreary hours of scouring. He had patience  with and compassion for every one. People knew that he was kind and  tender-hearted, for his pencil initials always appeared in some obscure corner  of every subscription list against a sum which was bulky when taken in relation  to the amount of his salary. People knew that he was brave, for he had once  threatened to fling Mr. Spavin into the pit, when that gentleman had made some  insinuation impeaching Richard&rsquo;s honour as to the unfair use of gold-leaf in  the Enchanted Caves of Azure Deep. They knew that he  was dutiful, and kind, and true to the old music-mistress with whom he lived,  and whom he helped to support. They knew that when other men made light of  sacred things, and were witty and philosophical upon very solemn subjects,  Richard Thornton would leave the assembly gravely and quietly, how eloquent or  lively soever he might have been before. People knew all this, and were  respectful to the young scene-painter, in spite of the rainbow smears of paint  upon his shabby coat, and the occasional fringe of mud upon the frayed edges of  his trousers.</p>
<p>Upon this august morning Mr. Thornton made very short work of  his toilet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go out to breakfast,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;though I can get two  courses and a dessert in the Palais Royal, to say nothing of half a bottle of  sour claret, for fifteen pence. I&rsquo;ll get some coffee and rolls, and go to work  at some of the scenes for &lsquo;Raoul.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang a bell near his bed, pushed a table to the window which  looked out into the quadrangle of the hotel, and sat down with a battered tin  box of water-colours and a few squares of Bristol board before him. He had to  ring several times before one of the waiters condescended to answer his  summons, but he worked away cheerily, smoking as he worked, at a careful  water-coloured copy of a rough pencil-sketch which he had made a couple of  nights before in the pit of the theatre.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t leave off to eat his breakfast when it came,  by-and-by, but buttered his rolls and drank his coffee in the pauses of his  work, only laying down his brush for a minute or so at a time. The scene was a  street in old Paris, the houses very dark and brown, with over-hanging latticed  windows, exterior staircases, practicable bridges, and all sorts of devices  which called for the employment of a great deal of glue and pasteboard in  Richard&rsquo;s model. This scene was only one out of eight, and the young  scene-painter wanted to take perfect models of all the eight scenes back to the  Ph&oelig;nix. He had M. Michel L&eacute;vy&rsquo;s sixty centimes edition of the new play spread  open before him, and referred to it now and again as he painted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Enter&nbsp;<i>Raoul</i>&nbsp;down staircase in  flat.&nbsp;<i>Raoul&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;a doctor, and the house with the staircase is  his. The house at the corner belongs to&nbsp;<i>Gobemouche</i>, the comic  barber, and the practicable lattice is&nbsp;<i>Madeline&rsquo;s</i>. She&rsquo;ll come to  her window by-and-by to talk to the doctor, whom she thinks a very excellent man;  though he&rsquo;s been giving her mild doses of&nbsp;<i>aqua tofana</i>&nbsp;for the  last three weeks.&nbsp;<i>Catherine de&rsquo; Medicis</i>&nbsp;comes over the  practicable bridge, presently, disguised as a nun. I wonder how many melodramas  poor&nbsp;<i>Catherine</i>&nbsp;has appeared in since she left this mortal  stage. Did she ever do anything except poison people, I wonder, while she was  alive? She never does at the Porte Saint Martin, or on the Surrey side of the Thames. I must sketch the costumes, by-and-bye.&nbsp;<i>Raoul</i>&nbsp;in  black velvet and scarlet tights, a pointed beard, straight eyebrows, short  black hair,&mdash;austere and dignified. Cromshaw will do&nbsp;<i>Raoul</i>, of  course, and Spavin will play the light-comedy soldier who gets drunk, and tears  off&nbsp;<i>Catherine&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;velvet mask in the last scene. Yes, that&rsquo;ll be  a great scene on our side of the water.&nbsp;<i>Charles the Ninth</i>&mdash;he&rsquo;s a  muff, so anybody can play him&mdash;has just finished reading the arsenicated edition  of a treatise on hawking, closes the last page of the book, feels the first  spasm.&nbsp;<i>Catherine</i>, disguised as a nun, has been followed by  Spavin&mdash;by the comedy-soldier, I mean&mdash;to the Louvre, after a conversation having  been overheard between her and&nbsp;<i>Raoul</i>. The&nbsp;<i>King</i>, in the  agonies of spasmodic affection, asks who has murdered him. &lsquo;That woman&mdash;that  sorceress&mdash;that fiend in human form!&rsquo; cries the soldier, snatching the mask  from&nbsp;<i>Catherine&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;face.&mdash;&lsquo;Merciful Heaven, it is my mother!&rsquo;  shrieks the&nbsp;<i>King</i>, falling dead with a final spasm. That &lsquo;it is my  mother!&rsquo; ought to be good for three rounds of applause, at least. I dare  say&nbsp;<i>Spavin</i>&nbsp;will have the speech transferred from the&nbsp;<i>King&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;part  to his own. &lsquo;Merciful Heaven, it is&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;mother!&rsquo; would do just  as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Richard Thornton, not having risen very early, worked on  till past five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon before his model was finished. He got  up with a sigh of relief when the pasteboard presentment of the old Parisian street  stood out upon the little table, square and perfect.</p>
<p>He filled his pipe and walked up and down before the table,  smoking and admiring his work in an innocent rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Nelly,&rdquo; he thought presently. &ldquo;I promised I would call in  the Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que to-day, to pay my respects to the old chap. Not that he&rsquo;d  particularly care to see me, I dare say; but Nell is such a darling. If she  asked me to stand on my head, and do poor old Goffie&rsquo;s gnome-fly business, I  think I should try and do it. However, it is too late to call upon Mr.  Vandeleur Vane to-day, so I must put that off till to-morrow. I must drop in  again at half-price at the Porte Saint Martin, to have another look at the  scene in eight compartments. That&rsquo;ll be rather a poser for the machinist at the  Ph&oelig;nix, I flatter myself. Yes, I must have one more look at it, and&mdash;Ah!  by-the-bye, there&rsquo;s the Morgue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Thornton finished his pipe and rubbed his chin with a  reflective air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must have a look at the Morgue before I go,&rdquo; he thought;  &ldquo;I promised that old nuisance J. T. Jumballs that I&rsquo;d refresh my memory  about&nbsp;the Morgue. He&rsquo;s doing a great drama in which one half of the&nbsp;<i>dramatis  person&aelig;</i>&nbsp;recognise the other half dead on the marble slabs. He&rsquo;s never  been across the Channel, and I think his notions of the Morgue are somewhat  foggy. He fancies it&rsquo;s about as big as Westminster Abbey, I know, and he wants  the governors to give him the whole depth of the stage for his great scene, and  set it obliquely, like the Assyrian hall in &lsquo;Sardanapalus,&rsquo; so as to give the  idea of illimitable extent. I&rsquo;m to paint the scene for him. &lsquo;<i>The interior of  the Morgue by lamplight. The meeting of the living and the dead.</i>&rsquo; That&rsquo;ll  be rather a strong line for the bill, at any rate. I&rsquo;ll go and have some dinner  in the Palais Royal, and then go down and have a look at the gloomy place. An  exterior wouldn&rsquo;t be bad, with Notre Dame in the distance, but an interior&mdash;Bah!  J. T. J. is a clever fellow, but I wish his genius didn&rsquo;t lie so much in the  charnel-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put on his hat, left his room, locked the door, and ran down  the polished staircase whistling merrily as he went. He was glad to be released  from his work, pleased at the prospect of a few hours&rsquo; idleness in the foreign  city. Many people, inhabitants and visitors, thought Paris dull, dreary, and deserted in this hot  August weather, but it was a delightful change from the Pilasters and the  primeval solitudes of Northumberland    Square, that quaint, grim, quadrangle of big  houses, whose prim middle-class inhabitants looked coldly over their smart wire  window-blinds at poor Richard&rsquo;s shabby coat.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornton got an excellent dinner at a great bustling  restaurateur&rsquo;s in the Palais Royal, where for two francs one might dine upon  all the delicacies of the season, in a splendid saloon, enlivened by the  martial braying of a brass band in the garden below.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<i>carte du jour</i>&nbsp;almost bewildered Richard by  its extent and grandeur, and he chose haphazard from the catalogue of soups  which the obliging waiter gabbled over for his instruction. He read all the  pleasing by-laws touching the non-division of dinners, and the admissibility of  exchanges in the way of a dish for a dessert, or a dessert for a dish, by payment  of a few extra centimes. He saw that almost all the diners hid themselves  behind great wedges of orange-coloured melon at an early stage of the banquet,  and generally wound up with a small white washing-basin of lobster salad, the  preparation of which was a matter of slow and solemn care and thought. He  ordered his dinner in humble imitation of these accomplished&nbsp;<i>habitu&eacute;s</i>,  and got very good value for his two francs, and then paid his money, bowed to  the graceful lady who sat in splendid attire in a very bower of salads and  desserts, and went down a broad staircase that led into a street behind the  Palais Royal, and thence to the Rue Richelieu.</p>
<p>He treated himself to a cup of coffee and a cigar at a caf&eacute; in  the Place de la Bourse, and then strolled slowly away towards the Seine, smoking, and dawdling to look at this and that as  he walked along. It was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock therefore when he emerged, from  some narrow street, upon the quay, and made his way towards that bridge beneath  whose shadow the Morgue hides, like some foul and unhallowed thing. He did not  much like the task which Mr. Jumballs had imposed upon him, but he was too  good-natured to refuse compliance with the transpontine dramatist&rsquo;s desire, and  far too conscientious to break a promise once made, however disagreeable the  performance of that promise might prove.</p>
<p>He walked on resolutely, therefore, towards the black, shed-like  building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there are no bodies there to-night,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;One  glance round the place will show me all I want to see. I hope there are no poor  dead creatures there to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped before going in and looked at a couple of women who  were standing near, chattering together with no little gesticulation.</p>
<p>He asked one of these women the question, Were there any bodies  in the Morgue?</p>
<p>Yes,&mdash;the women both answered with one voice. There had not long  been brought the body of a gentleman, an officer it was thought, poisoned in a  gaming-house. A murder, perhaps, or a suicide; no one knew which.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton shrugged his shoulders as he turned away from  the idle gossips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people would call me a coward if they knew how I dislike  going into this place,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>He threw away his cigar, took off his hat, and slowly crossed  the dark threshold of the Parisian dead-house.</p>
<p>When he came out again, which was not until after the lapse of  at least a quarter of an hour, his face was almost as white as the face of the  corpse he had left within. He went upon the bridge, scarcely knowing where he  went, and walking like a man who walks in his sleep.</p>
<p>Not more than half a dozen yards from the Morgue he came  suddenly upon the lonely figure of a girl, whose arm rested on the parapet of  the bridge and whose pale face was turned towards the towers of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>She looked up as he approached, and called him by his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>&nbsp;here, Eleanor,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come away, child;  come away, for pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter  7<br>
  Suspense</b></h2>
<p>Eleanor Vane&nbsp;and the scene-painter stood upon  the bridge looking at each other for a few moments after Richard&rsquo;s cry of mingled  terror and astonishment.</p>
<p>Had not Eleanor&rsquo;s mind been entirely absorbed by one cruel  anxiety, she would have wondered at her old friend&rsquo;s strange greeting. As it  was, she took no heed of his manner. The shadows of the summer night were  gathering over the city and upon the quiet river; the towers of Notre Dame  loomed dimly through the twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Richard!&rdquo; Eleanor cried, &ldquo;I have been so unhappy. Papa  didn&rsquo;t come home all last night, nor yet to-day. I waited for him hour after  hour until late in the afternoon; and then the house seemed unbearable; I&nbsp;<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>&nbsp;stay  in any longer, and I came out to look for him. I have been far up on the  Boulevard where I parted with him last night, and all the way along the crowded  streets&nbsp;about there: and then through other streets, till I found myself  down here by the water, and I&rsquo;m so tired. Oh, Dick, Dick, how unkind of papa  not to come home. How unkind of my darling father to give me this misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clasped her hands convulsively upon her companion&rsquo;s arm, and  bending her head, burst into tears. Those tears were the first which she had  shed in all her trouble; the first relief after long hours of agonising  suspense, of weary watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can papa treat me so?&rdquo; she cried, amid her sobbing.  &ldquo;How can he treat me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, suddenly raising her head, she looked at Richard Thornton,  her clear grey eyes dilated with a wild terror, which gave her face a strange  and awful beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;Richard! you don&rsquo;t think that there&mdash;that  there is&mdash;anything wrong&mdash;that anything has happened to my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not wait for him to answer, but cried out directly, as  if shrinking in terror from the awful suggestion in her own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should happen to him? he is so well and strong, poor  darling. If he is old, he is not&nbsp;<i>like</i>&nbsp;an old man, you know.  The people of the house in the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que have been very kind to me;  they say I am quite foolish to be frightened, and they told me that papa  stopped out all night once last summer. He went to Versailles to see some friends, and stayed  away all night without giving any notice that he was going to do so. I know  it&rsquo;s very silly of me to be so frightened, Richard. But I always was frightened  at Chelsea if  he stayed out. I used to fancy all sorts of things. I thought of all kinds of  dreadful things last night, Dick, and to-day, until my fancies almost drove me  mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During all this time the scene-painter had not spoken. He seemed  utterly unable to offer any word of comfort to the poor girl who clung to him  in her distress, looking to him for consolation and hope.</p>
<p>She looked wonderingly into his face, puzzled by his silence,  which seemed unfeeling, and it was not like Richard to be unfeeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard!&rdquo; she cried, almost impatiently. &ldquo;Richard, speak to me!  You see how much misery I&rsquo;ve suffered, and you don&rsquo;t say a word! You&rsquo;ll help me  to find papa, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked down at her. Heaven knows she would have  seen no lack of tenderness or compassion in his face, if it had not been hidden  by the gathering gloom of the August evening. He drew her hand through his arm,  and led her away towards the other side of the water, leaving the black roof of  the dead-house behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing I would not do to help you, Eleanor,&rdquo; he said,  gently. &ldquo;God knows my heart, my dear, and He knows how faithfully I will try to  help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will look for papa, Richard, if he should not come home  to-night&mdash;he may be at home now, you know, and he may be angry with me for  coming out alone, instead of waiting quietly at home till he returned; but if  he should not come to-night, you&rsquo;ll look for him, won&rsquo;t you, Richard? You&rsquo;ll  search all Paris  till you find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do everything that I could do for you if I were your  brother, Eleanor,&rdquo; the young man answered gravely; &ldquo;there are times in our  lives when nobody but God can help us, my dear, and when we must turn to Him.  It&rsquo;s in the day of trouble that we want His help, Nelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. I prayed, last night, again, and again, and  again, that papa might come back soon. I have been saying the same prayer all  to-day, Richard; even just now, when you found me standing by the parapet of  the bridge, I was praying for my dear father. I saw the church towers looking  so grand and solemn in the twilight, and the sight of them made me remember how  powerful God is, and that He can always grant our prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it seems best and wisest in His sight, Nell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course; sometimes we pray for foolish things, but there  could be nothing foolish in wishing my darling father to come back to me. Where  are you taking me, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor stopped suddenly, and looked at her companion. She had  need to ask the question, for Richard Thornton was leading her into a labyrinth  of streets in the direction of the Luxembourg, and seemed to have very  little notion whither he was going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the way home, Richard,&rdquo; Eleanor said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know  where we are, but we seem to be going further and further away from home. Will  you take me back to the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que, Dick? We must cross the river again,  you know, to get there. I want to go home at once. Papa may have come home, and  he&rsquo;ll be angry, perhaps, if he finds me absent. Take me home, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, my dear. We&rsquo;ll cross the water further on, by the  Louvre; and now tell me, Eleanor&mdash;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t very well make inquiries about your  father, unless I fully understand the circumstances under which you parted from  him last night. How was it, my dear? What happened when Mr. Vane left you upon  the Boulevard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were walking in a broad, quiet street in which there were  very few passers-by. The houses stood back behind ponderous gates, and were  hidden by sheltering walls. The stately mansions between court and garden had  rather a decayed aspect, which gave a certain dreariness to their grandeur. The  fashionable world seemed to have deserted this quiet quarter for the leafy  avenues leading away from the Champs Elys&eacute;es.</p>
<p>Richard and Eleanor walked slowly along the broad footway. The  stillness of the soft summer night had some effect upon the school-girl&rsquo;s fever  of impatience. The grave, compassionate tones of her friend&rsquo;s voice soothed  her. The burst of passionate weeping which had almost convulsed her slight  frame half an hour before, had been an unspeakable relief to her. She clung to  her companion&rsquo;s arm confidingly, and walked patiently by his side, without  questioning him as to where he was leading her, though she had a vague idea  that he was not taking her homewards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be foolish about papa,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I will do as you  tell me, Richard, I will trust in God. I am sure my dear father will return to  me. We are so fond of each other; you know, Richard, we are all the world to  each other; and my poor darling looks so hopefully forward to the&nbsp;day in  which he will have Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune. I don&rsquo;t hope for that quite so  much as papa does, Dick; for Mr. de Crespigny may live to be a very, very old  man, and it seems so wicked to wish for any one&rsquo;s death. The day I look forward  to is the day when I shall have finished my education, and be able to work for  papa. That must be almost better than being rich, I should think, Dick. I can&rsquo;t  imagine any happier fate than to work for those we love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face brightened as she talked, and she turned to her  companion, looking to him for sympathy; but Richard&rsquo;s head was averted, and he  seemed to be staring absently at the houses upon the opposite side of the way.</p>
<p>He was silent for some moments after Eleanor had left off  speaking; and then he said, rather abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, my dear, how did you part with your father last  night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we had been dining on the Boulevard; and after dinner,  papa took me for a long walk, ever so far, past all the theatres, and he had  promised to take me to the Ambigu or the Porte Saint Martin; but as we were  coming back we met two gentlemen, friends of papa&rsquo;s, who stopped him and said  they had an appointment with him, and persuaded him to go back with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back with them! Back where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean back towards a big stone gateway we had passed a little  time before. I only know they turned that way, but I don&rsquo;t know where they  went. I stood and watched them till they were out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the two men, what were they like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them was a little Frenchman, stout and rosy-faced, with  a light moustache and beard like the Emperor&rsquo;s. He was smartly dressed, and had  a cane, which he kept twirling when he talked to papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what he said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he spoke in a low voice, and he talked French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you speak French, Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not as they speak it here. The people seem to talk so  fast here, it&rsquo;s quite difficult to understand them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the other man, Nell, what was he like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was a disagreeable-looking man, and seemed to have a  sulky manner, as if he was offended with papa for breaking his appointment, and  didn&rsquo;t care how the matter ended. I scarcely saw his face, at least only for a  moment, just long enough to see that he had black eyes, and a thick black  moustache. He was tall, and shabbily dressed, and I fancied he was an  Englishman, though he never once spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never spoke! It was the Frenchman, then, who persuaded your  father to go away with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he seemed very anxious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Thornton muttered something between his set teeth,  something which sounded like a curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me one thing, Eleanor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your poor father never  was too well off, I know. He could not be likely to have much money about him  last night. Do you know if he had any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had a great deal of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a great deal? A few pounds, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, much more than that,&rdquo; Eleanor answered. &ldquo;He had a hundred  pounds&mdash;a hundred pounds in new bank notes, French notes. It was the money my  half-sister, Mrs. Bannister, had sent him, to pay for my education at Madame  Marly&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bannister,&rdquo; said Richard, catching at the name. &ldquo;Ah, to be  sure, I remember now. Mrs. Bannister is your sister. She is very well off, is  she not, and has been kind to you? If you were in any trouble, you would go to  her, I suppose, Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to her if I were in trouble! Oh, no, no, Dick, not for the  world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not? She has been kind to you, hasn&rsquo;t she, Nell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very kind in paying money for my education, and all  that; but you know, Richard, there are some people who seem to do kind things  in an unkind manner. If you knew the cruel letter that Mrs. Bannister wrote to  papa&mdash;the cruel, humiliating things she said only a few days ago, you couldn&rsquo;t  wonder that I don&rsquo;t like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is your sister, Nell; your nearest relation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she ought to love you, and be kind to you. She lives at  Bayswater, I think I&rsquo;ve heard you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in Hyde Park   Gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. Mrs. Bannister, Hyde Park Gardens,  Bayswater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated the name and address, as if he wished to impress  them upon his memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take you home now, Nell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My poor child, you  must be tired to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I think about being tired, Richard,&rdquo; exclaimed Eleanor,  &ldquo;when I am so anxious about papa? Oh, if I only find him at home, what  happiness it will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she hung heavily upon her friend&rsquo;s arm, and Richard knew  that she was very tired. She had been wandering about Paris for several hours, poor child, hither  and thither, in the long, unfamiliar streets, following all sorts of unlikely  people who looked in the distance something like her father; hoping again and  again, only again and again to be disappointed.</p>
<p>They turned into a wider thoroughfare presently, and the  scene-painter called the first hackney vehicle which passed him, and lifted  Eleanor into it. She was almost fainting with fatigue and exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you had to eat to-day, Nell?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She hesitated a little, as if she had forgotten what she had  eaten, or indeed whether she had eaten at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some coffee and a couple of rolls sent for papa this  morning. He has his breakfast sent him from a&nbsp;<i>traiteur&rsquo;s</i>, you know.  I had one of the rolls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve had nothing since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. How could I eat when I was so wretched about papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard shook his head reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling Nell!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you promised me just now that you&rsquo;d  be a good girl, and trust in Providence.  I shall take you somewhere and give you some supper, and then you must promise  me to go home and get a good night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do whatever you tell me, Richard,&rdquo; Eleanor answered,  submissively, &ldquo;but let me go home first, please, and see if papa has come  back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene-painter did not for a few moments reply to this  request, but he answered presently in an abstracted tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall do what you like, Nell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told the coachman to drive to the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que, but he  would not let Eleanor alight from the vehicle when they reached the corner of  the street and the little butcher&rsquo;s shop, eager as she was to spring out and  run into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, Nell,&rdquo; he said, authoritatively. &ldquo;I will  make all inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor obeyed him. She was enfeebled and exhausted by a weary  night of watching, a long day of agitation and anxiety, and she was too weak to  oppose her old friend. She looked hopelessly up at the open windows on the  entresol. They were exactly as she had left them four or five hours ago. No  glimmer of light gave friendly token that the rooms were occupied.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton talked to the butcher&rsquo;s wife for a long time,  as it seemed to Eleanor, but he had very little to tell her when he came back  to the carriage. Mr. Vane had not returned: that was all he said.</p>
<p>He took his companion to a caf&eacute; near the Madeleine, where he  insisted upon her taking a large cup of coffee and a roll. It was all he could  persuade her to take, and she begged to be allowed to sit at one of the tables  outside the caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>She might see her father go by, she said, on his way to the Rue  de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que.</p>
<p>The two friends sat at a little iron table rather apart from the  groups of animated loungers sitting at other tables drinking coffee and  lemonade. But George Mowbray Vandeleur Vane did not pass that way throughout  the half hour during which Eleanor lingered over her cup of coffee.</p>
<p>It was past ten o&rsquo;clock when Richard Thornton bade her good  night at the threshold of the little door beside the butcher&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must promise me not to sit up to-night, Nelly,&rdquo; he said, as  he shook hands with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mind you keep your promise this time. I will come and see  you early to-morrow. God bless you my dear, and good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed her hand tenderly. When she had closed the door  behind her, he crossed the narrow street, and waited upon the other side of the  way until he saw a light in one of the entresol windows. He watched while  Eleanor came to this window and drew a dark curtain across it, and then he  walked slowly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless her, poor child,&rdquo; he murmured, in a low,  compassionate voice, &ldquo;poor lonely child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave thoughtfulness of his expression never changed as he  walked homewards to the H&ocirc;tel des Deux Mondes. Late as it was when he reached  his chamber on the fifth storey, he seated himself at the table, and pushing  aside his clay pipe and tobacco-pouch, his water-colours and brushes, his  broken palettes and scraps of Bristol board, and all the litter of his day&rsquo;s  work, he took a few sheets of foreign letter paper and a tiny bottle of ink  from a shabby leather desk, and began to write.</p>
<p>He wrote two letters, both rather long, and folded, sealed, and  addressed them.</p>
<p>One was directed to Mrs. Bannister, Hyde Park Gardens,  Bayswater; the other to Signora Picirillo, the Pilasters, Dudley Street,  Northumberland Square.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton put both these letters in his pocket and went  out to post them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have acted for the best,&rdquo; he muttered, as he went  back to the hotel near the market-place; &ldquo;I can do nothing more until  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter  8<br>
  Good Samaritans</b></h2>
<p>George Vane&nbsp;did not come home. Eleanor kept  the promise made to her faithful friend, and tried to sleep. She flung herself,  dressed as she was, upon the little bed near the curtained alcove. She would  thus be ready to run to her father, whenever he came in, she thought, to  welcome and minister to him. She was thoroughly worn out, and she slept; a wretched  slumber, broken by nightmares and horrible dreams, in which she saw her father  assailed by all kinds of dangers, a prey to every manner of misfortune and  vicissitude. Once she saw him standing on a horrible rock, menaced by a swiftly  advancing tide, while she was in a boat only a few paces from him, as it  seemed, doing battle with the black waves, and striving with all her might to  reach and rescue him, but never able to do so.</p>
<p>In another dream he was wandering upon the crumbling verge of a  precipice&mdash;he seemed a white haired, feeble, tottering old man in this  vision&mdash;and again she was near him, but unable to give him warning of his  danger, though a word would have done so. The agony of her endeavour to utter  the one cry which would have called that idolised father from his death, awoke  her.</p>
<p>But she had other dreams, dreams of quite a different character,  in which her father was restored to her, rich and prosperous, and he and she  were laughing merrily at all the foolish tortures she had inflicted upon herself;  and other dreams again, which seemed so real that she fancied she must be  awake; dreams in which she heard the welcome footsteps upon the stair, the  opening of the door, and her father&rsquo;s voice in the next room calling to her.</p>
<p>These dreams were the worst of all. It was terrible to awake  after many such delusions and find she had been again deluded. It was cruel to  awake to the full sense of her loneliness, while the sound of the voice she had  heard in her dream still lingered in her ears.</p>
<p>The dark hours of the short summer night seemed interminable to  her in this wretched, bewildered, half-sleeping, half-waking state; far longer  than they had appeared when she sat up&nbsp;watching for her father&rsquo;s return.  Every fresh dream was a slow agony of terror and perplexity.</p>
<p>At last the grey daylight stole in through the half-closed  shutters, the vague outlines of the furniture grew out of the darkness, duskily  impalpable and ghastly at first, then sharp and distinct in the cold morning  light. She could not rest any longer she got up and went to the window; she  pushed the sash open, and sank down on her knees with her forehead resting on  the window sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wait for him here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I shall hear his step  in the street. Poor dear, poor dear, I can guess why he stays away. He has  spent that odious money, and does not like to return and tell me so. My darling  father, do you know me so little as to think that I would grudge you the last  farthing I had in the world, if you wanted it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts rambled on in strange confusion until they grew  bewildering, her brain became dizzy with perpetual repetitions of the same  idea; when she lifted her head&mdash;her poor, weary, burning, heavy head, which  seemed a leaden weight that it was almost impossible to raise&mdash;and looked from  the window, the street below reeled beneath her eyes, the floor upon which she  knelt seemed sinking with her into some deep gulf of blackness and horror; a  thousand conflicting sounds&mdash;not the morning noises of the waking city&mdash;hissed  and buzzed, and roared and thundered in her ears, growing louder and louder and  louder, until they all melted away in the fast-gathering darkness.</p>
<p>The sun was shining brightly into the room when the  compassionate mistress of the house found Mr. Vane&rsquo;s daughter half-kneeling,  half-lying on the ground, with her head upon the cold sill of the open window,  and her golden hair streaming in draggled curls about her shoulders. Her thin  muslin frock was wet with the early dew. She had fainted away, and had lain  thus, helpless and insensible, for several hours.</p>
<p>The butcher&rsquo;s wife undressed her and put her to bed. Richard  Thornton came to the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que half an hour afterwards, and went away  again directly to look for an English doctor. He found one, an elderly man with  grave and gentle manners, who declared that Miss Vane was suffering from fever  brought on by intense mental excitement: she was of a highly nervous  temperament, he said, and that she required little to be done for her; she only  wanted repose and quiet. Her constitution was superb, and would triumph over a  far more serious attack than this.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton took the doctor into the adjoining room, the  little sitting-room which bore the traces of Mr. Vane&rsquo;s occupation, and talked  to him in a low voice for some minutes. The medical man shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very sad,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it will be better to tell her the  truth, if possible, as soon as she recovers from the delirium. The anxiety and  suspense have overtaxed her brain. Anything would be better than that this  overstrained state of the mind should continue. Her constitution will rally  after a shock; but, with her highly nervous and imaginative nature, everything  is to be dreaded from prolonged mental irritation. She is related to you, I  suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, poor child! I wish she were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is not without near relatives, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she has sisters&mdash;or at least half-sisters&mdash;and brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should be written to, then, immediately,&rdquo; the doctor said,  as he took up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have written to one of her sisters, and I have written to  another lady, a friend, who will be of more use, I fancy, in this crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor went away, promising to send some saline draughts to  keep the fever under, and to call again in the evening.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton went into the little bed-chamber where the  butcher&rsquo;s wife sat beside the curtained alcove, making up some accounts in a  leather-covered book. She was a hearty pleasant-mannered young woman, and had  taken up her post by the invalid&rsquo;s bed very willingly, although her presence  was always much needed in the shop below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chut</i>&rdquo; she whispered, with her finger on her lip, &ldquo;she  sleeps,&nbsp;<i>pauvrette!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard sat down quietly by the open window. He took out Michel  L&egrave;vy&rsquo;s edition of &ldquo;Raoul,&rdquo; a stump of lead pencil, and the back of an old  letter, and set to work resolutely at his adaptation. He could not afford to  lose time, even though his adopted sister lay ill under the shadow of the  worsted curtains that shrouded the alcove on the other side of the little room.</p>
<p>He sat long and patiently, turning the Poison drama into English  with wonderful ease and rapidity, and meekly bearing a deprivation that was no  small one to him, in the loss of his clay pipe, which he was in the habit of  smoking at all hours of the day.</p>
<p>Eleanor awoke at last, and began talking in a rambling,  incoherent way about her father, and the money sent by Mrs. Bannister, and the  parting upon the Boulevard.</p>
<p>The butcher&rsquo;s wife drew back the curtain, and Richard Thornton  went to the bedside and looked down tenderly at his childish friend.</p>
<p>Her amber-tinted hair was scattered on the pillow, tangled and  roughened by the constant movement of her restless head. Her grey eyes were  feverishly bright, and burning spots blazed upon the cheeks which had been so  deathly pale on the previous night. She knew Richard, and spoke to him; but the  delirium was not over, for she mixed the events of the present with the Chelsea experiences of  long ago, and talked to her old friend of the signora, the violin, and the  rabbits. She fell off into a heavy sleep again, after taking the effervescing  medicine sent her by the English surgeon, and slept until nearly twilight. In  these long slumbers her fresh and powerful constitution asserted itself, and  took compensation for the strain that had been made upon it in the past day or  two.</p>
<p>Richard went away in the afternoon, and did not return till late  at night, when the butcher&rsquo;s wife told him that her charge had been very  restless, and had asked repeatedly for her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; the good woman said,&nbsp;shrugging her  shoulders with a despairing gesture. &ldquo;Are we to tell her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Richard answered. &ldquo;Keep her quiet; keep her as quiet  as you can. And if it is positively necessary to tell her anything, say that  her father has been taken ill, away from home, and cannot be brought back yet.  Poor child! it seems so cruel to keep her in suspense, and still more cruel to  deceive her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butcher&rsquo;s wife promised to do all in her power to keep her  patient quiet. The doctor had sent an opiate. Miss Vane could not sleep too  much, he said.</p>
<p>So another night passed, this time very peacefully for Eleanor,  who lay in a heavy slumber broken by no cruel dreams. She was very, very weak  the next day, for she had scarcely eaten anything since the roll and coffee  which Richard had made her take; and though she was not exactly delirious, her  mind seemed almost incapable of receiving any very vivid impression. She  listened quietly when they told her that her father could not come home because  he was ill.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton came to the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que several times  during this second day of Eleanor&rsquo;s illness, but he only stayed a few minutes  upon each occasion. He had a great deal to do, he told the butcher&rsquo;s wife, who  still kept faithfully to her post in the sick room, only stealing away now and  then, while Eleanor was asleep, to attend to her business.</p>
<p>It was past eleven o&rsquo;clock that night when the scene-painter  came for the last time. Eleanor had grown worse as the evening advanced, and  was by this time terribly feverish and restless. She wanted to get up and dress  herself, and go to her father. If he was ill, how could they keep her from him,  how could they be so cruel as to keep her from his side?</p>
<p>Then, starting up suddenly from her pillow, she would cry out  wildly that they were deceiving her, and that her father was dead.</p>
<p>But help and comfort was near at hand. When Richard came, he did  not come alone. He brought a lady with him; an elderly, grey-headed woman,  dressed in shabby black.</p>
<p>When this lady appeared upon the threshold of the dimly-lighted  little bedchamber, Eleanor Vane suddenly sprang up in bed, and threw out her  arms with a wild cry of surprise and delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Signora!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;the dear, kind Signora!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady took off her bonnet, and then went close up to the bed,  and seating herself on the edge of the mattress, drew Eleanor&rsquo;s fair head upon  her bosom, smoothing the tangled golden hair with unspeakable tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor child!&rdquo; she murmured again and again. &ldquo;My poor, poor  child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear Signora,&rdquo; Eleanor cried, wonderingly, &ldquo;how is it that  you are here? Why didn&rsquo;t Richard tell me that you were in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have only just arrived, my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only just arrived! Only just arrived in Paris! But why did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to see you, Eleanor,&rdquo; the Signora answered, very gently.  &ldquo;I heard that you were in trouble, my dear, and I have come to you, to help and  comfort you, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butcher&rsquo;s wife had withdrawn into the little sitting-room  where Richard sat in the darkness. Eleanor Vane and the Signora were therefore  quite alone.</p>
<p>Hitherto the invalid&rsquo;s head had rested very quietly upon her  friend&rsquo;s bosom, but now she lifted it suddenly and looked full in the Signora&rsquo;s  face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came to me because I was in trouble,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How should  I be in trouble so long as my father lives? What sorrow can come to me while he  is safe? He is ill, they say, but he will get better; he will get better, won&rsquo;t  he? He will be better soon, dear Signora; he will be better soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited for an answer to her breathless questioning, looking  intently in the pale quiet face of her friend; then suddenly, with a low,  wailing cry, she flung up her hands and clasped them wildly above her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all deceived me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you have all deceived  me: my father is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Signora drew her arm caressingly round Eleanor Vane, and  tried to shelter the poor burning head once more upon her shoulder; but Eleanor  shrank from her with an impatient gesture, and, with her hands still clasped  above her head, stared blankly at the dead wall before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, my dear,&rdquo; the Signora said, trying to unclasp the  rigid hands which were so convulsively clasped together. &ldquo;Eleanor, my dear,  listen to me; for pity&rsquo;s sake try and listen to me, my own dear love. You must  know, you must have long known, my dear, that heavy sorrows come to us all,  sooner or later. It is the common lot, my love, and we must all bow before the  Divine hand that afflicts us. If there were no sorrow in this world, Eleanor,  we should grow too much in love with our own happiness; we should be frightened  at the approach of grey hairs and old age; we should tremble at the thought of  death. If there were no better and higher life than this, Eleanor, sorrow and  death would indeed be terrible. You know how very much affliction has fallen to  my share, dear. You have heard me speak of the children I loved; all taken from  me, Nelly, all taken away. If it were not for my dear nephew, Richard, I should  stand quite alone in the world, a desolate old woman, with no hope on this side  of the grave. But when my sons were taken from me, God raised me up another son  in him. Do you think that God ever abandons us, Eleanor, even when He afflicts  us most heavily? I have lived a long life, my dear, and I tell you no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Signora waited in vain for some change in the rigid  attitude, the stony face. Eleanor Vane still stared blankly at the dead wall  before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all deceived me,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;my father is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was useless talking to her; the tenderest words were dull and  meaningless jargon to her ears. That night the fever grew worse, and the  delirium was at its height. The butcher&rsquo;s wife was relieved by a very patient  and accustomed&nbsp;watcher, for the Signora had sat by many sick-beds, hoping  against hope, until despair crept into her heart, as the grey shadows of  approaching death came over a beloved face, never again to pass away.</p>
<p>The fever lasted for several days and nights, but throughout  every change the English doctor declared that Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s constitution would  carry her through a worse attack than this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you told her,&rdquo; he said one morning to the Signora,  &ldquo;there will be less to tell her by-and-by, when she begins to get strong  again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was, therefore, something more to be told.</p>
<p>Little by little the fever passed away; the crimson spots faded  out of the invalid&rsquo;s hollow cheeks; the unnatural lustre of the grey eyes grew  less and less vivid; little by little the mind grew clearer, the delirious  wanderings less frequent.</p>
<p>But with the return of perfect consciousness there came terrible  bursts of grief&mdash;grief that was loud and passionate in proportion to the  impulsive vehemence of Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s character. This was her first sorrow, and  she could not bear it quietly. Floods of tears drowned her pillow night after  night; she refused to be comforted; she repulsed the patient Signora; she would  not listen to poor Richard, who came sometimes to sit by her side, and tried  his best to beguile her from her grief. She rebelled against their attempted  consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was my father to you?&rdquo; she cried, passionately. &ldquo;You can  afford to forget him. He was all the world to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not in Eleanor&rsquo;s nature to be long ungrateful for the  tenderness and compassion of those who were so patient with her in this dark  hour of her young life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good you are to me,&rdquo; she cried sometimes, &ldquo;and what a  wretch I am to think so little of your goodness. But you don&rsquo;t know how I loved  my father. You don&rsquo;t know&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know. I was to have worked for him; I was  to have worked for him by-and-by, and we were to have led such a happy life  together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was growing strong again in spite of her grief. Her elastic  temperament asserted itself in spite of her sorrow, which she never ceased to  think of night and day, and she arose after her illness like a beautiful flower  which had been beaten and crushed by the storm.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton&rsquo;s leave of absence had expired for some days,  but the Royal Ph&oelig;nix Theatre closed its doors in the hot summer months, and he  was therefore comparatively free. He stayed in Paris with his aunt, for they were both bent  upon one purpose, to be accomplished at any sacrifice to themselves. Thank  Heaven! there are always good Samaritans in the world, who&nbsp;do do&nbsp;not  mind turning backward upon their life&rsquo;s journey when there is a desolate and  wounded traveller in need of their help and tenderness.</p>
<p>The Parisian atmosphere was cooling down in the early days of  September&mdash;faint but refreshing breezes were beginning to blow away the white  mists of summer heat upon the boulevards, when Eleanor Vane was well enough to  sit in the little saloon above the butcher&rsquo;s shop, and drink tea in the English  fashion with her two friends.</p>
<p>She was well enough to do this, and Richard and the Signora were  beginning to think of turning homewards; but before they could well leave Paris there was something  that ought to be told to Eleanor&mdash;something that she&nbsp;<i>must</i>&nbsp;know  sooner or later&mdash;something that it would be perhaps better for her to know at  once.</p>
<p>But they had waited from time to time, thinking that she might  ask some question which would lead to the revelation that must ultimately be  made to her.</p>
<p>Upon this September afternoon she sat near the open window,  looking very beautiful and virginal in a loose white muslin dressing-gown, and  with her long golden curls falling upon her shoulders. She had been silent for  a long time: her two companions watching her furtively, observant of every  change in her countenance. Her cup of tea stood untasted on a little table at  her side, and she was sitting with her hands loosely locked together in her  lap.</p>
<p>She spoke at last, and asked that very question which must  inevitably lead to the revelation her friends had to make to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never told me how papa died,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;his death  must have been sudden, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane spoke very quietly. She had never before mentioned  her dead father&rsquo;s name with so little outward evidence of emotion. The hands  loosely locked together upon her lap stirred with a slightly tremulous motion;  the face, turned towards the Signora and Richard Thornton, had a look of fixed  intensity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa died suddenly, did he not?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, very suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so. But why was he not brought home? Why couldn&rsquo;t I  see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly, and turned her face away towards the open  window. She was trembling violently now from head to foot.</p>
<p>Her two companions were silent. That terrible something which  was as yet unrevealed must be told sooner or later; but who was to tell it to  this girl, with her excitable nature, her highly wrought nervous temperament?</p>
<p>The Signora shrugged her shoulders despondingly, as she looked  at her nephew. Mr. Thornton had been painting all the afternoon in the little  sitting-room. He had tried to interest Eleanor Vane in the great set scenes he  was preparing for&nbsp;<i>Raoul</i>. He had explained to her the nature of a  vampire trap in the wainscot of the poisoner&rsquo;s chamber, and had made his  pasteboard model limp in his repeated exhibition of its machinery. The vampire  trap was a subtle contrivance which might have beguiled any one from their  grief, Dick thought; but the wan smile with which Eleanor watched his work only  made the scene-painter&rsquo;s heart ache. Richard sighed as he returned his aunt&rsquo;s  look. It seemed quite a hopeless case as yet. This poor lonely child of fifteen  might go melancholy mad, perhaps, in her grief for a spendthrift father.</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane turned upon them suddenly while&nbsp;they sat  silent and embarrassed, wondering what they should say to her next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father committed suicide!&rdquo; she said, in a strangely quiet  voice.</p>
<p>The Signora started and rose suddenly, as if she would have gone  to Eleanor. Richard grew very pale, but sat looking down at the litter upon the  table, with one hand trifling nervously amongst the scraps of card-board and  wet paint-brushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Eleanor Vane, &ldquo;you have deceived me from first to  last. You told me first that he was not dead; but when you could no longer keep  my misery a secret from me, you only told me half the truth&mdash;you only told me  half the cruel truth. And even now, when I have suffered so much that it seems  as if no further suffering could touch me, you still deceive me, you still try  to keep the truth from me. My father parted from me in health and spirits.  Don&rsquo;t trifle with me, Signora; I am not a child any longer, I am not a foolish  school-girl, whom you can deceive as you like. I am a woman, and will know the  worst. My father killed himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had risen in her excitement, but clung with one hand to the  back of her chair, as if too weak to stand without that support.</p>
<p>The Signora went to her, and wound her arms about the slight  trembling figure; but Eleanor seemed almost unconscious of that motherly  caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth,&rdquo; she cried vehemently, &ldquo;did my father kill  himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is feared that he did, Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pale face grew a shade whiter, and the trembling frame  became suddenly rigid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is feared that he did!&rdquo; Eleanor Vane repeated. &ldquo;It is not  certain then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me the truth?&rdquo; cried the girl, passionately.  &ldquo;Do you think you can make my misery less to me by dropping out your words one  by one? Tell me the worst. What can there be worse than my father&rsquo;s death; his  unhappy death; killed by his own hand, his poor desperate hand? Tell me the  truth. If you don&rsquo;t wish me to go mad, tell me the truth at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Eleanor, I will,&rdquo; the Signora answered gently. &ldquo;I wish  to tell you all. I wish that you should know the truth, sad as it may be to  hear. This is the great sorrow of your life, my dear, and it has fallen upon  you very early. I hope you will try and bear it like a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane shook her head with an impatient gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of my sorrow,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what does it matter  what I suffer? My father, my poor father, what must he have suffered before he  did this dreadful act? Don&rsquo;t talk about me; tell me of him, and tell me the  worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, my darling, I will; but sit down, sit down, and try to  compose yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll stand here till you have told me the truth. I&rsquo;ll not  stir from this spot till I know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She disengaged herself from the Signora&rsquo;s supporting arm, and  with her hand still resting on the chair, stood resolute, and almost defiant,  before the old music-mistress and her nephew. I think the Signora and the scene-painter  were both afraid of her, she looked so grand in her beauty and despair.</p>
<p>She seemed indeed, as she had said, no longer a child or a  school-girl, but a woman, desperate and almost terrible in the intensity of her  despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell Eleanor the truth of this sad story,&rdquo; Richard said,  &ldquo;it may be told very briefly. When your father parted with you, Nelly, on the  night of the 11th of August, he and the two men who were with him went at once  to an obscure caf&eacute; in one of the streets near the Barri&egrave;re Saint Antoine. They  were in the habit of going there, it seems, sometimes playing billiards in the  large open room on the ground floor, sometimes playing cards in a&nbsp;<i>cabinet  particulier</i>&nbsp;on the entresol. Upon this night they went straight to the  private room. It was about half-past nine when they went in. The waiter who  attended upon them took them three bottles of Chambertin and a good deal of  seltzer-water. Your father seemed in high spirits at first. He and the dark  Englishman were playing &eacute;cart&eacute;, their usual game; and the Frenchman was looking  over your father&rsquo;s hand, now and then advising his play, now and then  applauding and encouraging him. All this came out upon inquiry. The Frenchman  quitted the caf&eacute; at a little before twelve; your father and the young  Englishman stayed till long after midnight, and towards one o&rsquo;clock they were  heard at high words, and almost immediately after one the Englishman went away,  leaving your father, who sent the waiter for some brandy and writing materials.  He wanted to write a letter before he left, he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene-painter paused, looking anxiously at the face of his  listener. The rigid intensity of that pale young face had undergone no change;  the grey eyes, fixed and dilated, were turned steadily towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the waiter took your father the things he had asked for,  he found him sitting at the table with his face hidden in his hands. The man  placed the brandy and writing materials upon the table, and then went away, but  not before he had noticed a strange faint smell&mdash;the smell of some drug, he  thought; but he had no idea then what drug. The waiter went down stairs; all  the ordinary frequenters of the place were gone, and the lights were out. The  man waited up to let your father out, expecting him to come down stairs every  moment. Three o&rsquo;clock struck, and the waiter went up-stairs upon the pretence  of asking if anything was wanted. He found your father sitting very much as he  had left him, except that this time his head was resting upon the table, which  was scattered with torn scraps of paper. He was dead, Eleanor. The man gave the  alarm directly, and a doctor came to give assistance, if any could have been  given; but the drug which the waiter had smelt was opium, and your father had  taken a quantity which would have killed the strongest man in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely tell you, my dear; but your poor father left,  among the scraps of paper upon&nbsp;the table, one fragment much larger and  more intelligible than the rest. It is evidently part of a letter addressed to  you; but it is very wildly and incoherently worded; and you must remember that  it was written under circumstances of great mental excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor stretched out her hand with an authoritative gesture.  Richard hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you to fully understand the nature of this letter before  you read it, Eleanor; I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kept the story of my father&rsquo;s death from me out of mistaken  kindness,&rdquo; the girl said, in an unfaltering voice; &ldquo;I will try and remember how  good you have been to me, so that I may forgive you that; but you cannot keep  from me the letter my father wrote to me before he died. That is mine, and I  claim it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her see it, poor child,&rdquo; said the Signora.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton took a leather memorandum-book from one of the  pockets of his loose coat. There were several papers in this book. He selected  one, and handed it silently to Eleanor Vane. It was a sheet of note-paper,  written upon in her father&rsquo;s hand, but a part of it had been torn away.</p>
<p>Even had the whole of the letter been left, the writer&rsquo;s style  was so wild and incoherent that it would have been no easy task to understand  his meaning. In its torn and fragmentary state, this scrap of writing left by  George Vane was only a scribble of confused and broken sentences. The sheet of  paper had been torn from the top to the bottom, so that the end of each line  was missing. The following broken lines were therefore all that Eleanor could  decipher, and in these the words were blotted and indistinct.</p>
<p class="note">&#8288;My poor Eleanor,&mdash;My poor injured<br>
  worst your cruel sister, Hortensia Bannis<br>
  could not be bad enough. I am a thief<br>
  robbed and cheated my own<br>
  been decoyed to this hell upon eart<br>
  wretches who are base enough to<br>
  a helpless old man who had trusted<br>
  to be gentlemen. I cannot return<br>
  look in my child&rsquo;s face after<br>
  money which was to have<br>
  education. Better to die and rid<br>
  But my blood be upon the head of<br>
  who has cheated me this night out of<br>

  never forget, Eleanor, never forget Robert Lan<br>
  murderer of your helpless old<br>
  a cheat and a villain who<br>
  some day live to revenge the fate<br>
  poor old father, who prays that God will<br>
  helpless old man whose folly<br>
madness have</p>
<p>There was no more. These lines were spread over the first leaf  of a sheet of note-paper; the second leaf, as well as a long strip of the  first, had been torn away.</p>
<p>This was the only clue to the secret of his death which George  Vane had left behind him.</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane folded the crumpled scrap of paper, and put it  tenderly in her bosom. Then, falling on her knees, she clasped her hands, and  lifted them towards the low ceiling of the little chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;hear the vow of a desolate creature,  who has only one purpose left in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Signora Picirillo knelt down beside her, and tried to clasp her  in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, my dear!&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;remember how this letter was  written&mdash;remember the state of your father&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember nothing,&rdquo; answered Eleanor Vane, &ldquo;except that my  father tells me to revenge his murder. For he was murdered,&rdquo; she cried, passionately,  &ldquo;if this money&mdash;this wretched money, which he would have died sooner than  lose&mdash;was taken from him unfairly. He was murdered. What did the wretch who  robbed him care what became of the poor, broken-hearted, helpless old man whom  he had wronged and cheated? What did he care? He left my father, left him in  his desolation and misery; left him after having stripped and beggared him;  left him to die in his despair. Listen to me, both of you, and remember what I  say. I am very young, I know, but I have learnt to think and act for myself  before to-day. I don&rsquo;t know this man&rsquo;s name, I never even saw his face; I don&rsquo;t  know who he is, or where he comes from; but sooner or later I swear to be  revenged upon him for my father&rsquo;s cruel death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor, Eleanor!&rdquo; cried the Signora; &ldquo;is this womanly? Is this  Christian-like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned upon her. There was almost a supernatural light,  now, in the dilated grey eyes. Eleanor Vane had risen from her knees, and stood  with her slender figure drawn to its fullest height, her long auburn hair  streaming over her shoulders, with the low light of the setting sun shining  upon the waving tresses until they glittered like molten gold. She looked, in  her desperate resolution and virginal beauty, like some young martyr of the middle  ages waiting to be led to the rack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it is womanly or Christian-like,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;but I know that it is henceforward the purpose of my life, and that it  is stronger than myself.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter  9<br>
  Looking To The Future</b></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;story which Richard Thornton had told Eleanor Vane  was the simple record of an unhappy truth. The gay and thoughtless spendthrift,  the man about town, who had outlived his age and spent three fortunes, had  ended his life, by his own desperate hand, in an obscure&nbsp;<i>caf&eacute;</i>&nbsp;near  the Barri&egrave;re Saint Antoine.</p>
<p>Amongst other habits of the age in which George Vane had lived,  gambling was pretty prevalent. Mr. Vane&rsquo;s sanguine nature was the very nature  which leads a man to the gaming-table, and holds him there under the demoniac  fascination of the fatal green cloth, hoping against hope, until his pockets  are empty, and he must needs crawl dispirited away, having no more money to  lose.</p>
<p>This was the one vice of George Vane&rsquo;s life. He had tried to  redeem his every-day extravagances by the gamester&rsquo;s frenzied speculations, the  gamester&rsquo;s subtle combinations, which are so infallible in theory, so ruinous  in practice. Eleanor had never known this. If her father stayed out late at  night, and she had to wait and watch for him through long weary hours of  suspense and anxiety, she never knew why he stayed, or why he was often so  broken down and wretched when he came home. Other people could guess the reason  of the old man&rsquo;s midnight absences from his shabby lodging, but they were too  merciful to tell his little girl the truth. In Paris, in a strange city, where  his acquaintance were few, the old vice grew stronger, and George Vane spent  his nights in gambling for pitiful stakes in any low haunts to which his  disreputable associates deluded him. He picked up strange acquaintance in these  days of his decadence, as poor people very often do: young men who were  wandering about the world, out at elbows, professionless young reprobates,  getting a very doubtful living by the exercise of their wits, men who were  content to flatter and pay court to the old beau so long as they could win a  few francs from him to pay for the evening&rsquo;s diversion.</p>
<p>With such men George Vane had associated for a long time. They  won pitiful sums of him, and cheated him without scruple; but his life was a  very dull one, remember; he had lived for the world, and society of some kind  or other was absolutely necessary to him. He clung, therefore, to these men,  and was fain to accept their homage in the hour of his decline; and it was with  such men as these he had spent the night before his death. It was such men as  these who had robbed him of the money which, but for an unhappy accident, would  have been safely handed over to the schoolmistress in the Bois   de Boulogne.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s death caused very little excitement in Paris. Public  gambling-houses had been abolished by the order of the Government long before;  and it was no longer a common thing for desperate men to scatter their brains  upon the table on which they had just squandered their money; but still people  knew very well that there was plenty of card-playing, and dice-throwing, and  billiard-playing, always going on here and there in the brilliant city, and the  suicide of a gambler more or less was not a thing to make any disturbance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bannister wrote a stiffly-worded letter in reply to that in  which Richard Thornton told her of her father&rsquo;s death, enclosing an order on  Messrs. Blount for the sum she considered sufficient to pay for the old man&rsquo;s  funeral, and to support Eleanor for a few weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should advise her early return to England,&rdquo; the stockbroker&rsquo;s  widow wrote, &ldquo;and I will endeavour to find her some decent situation&mdash;as nursery  governess or milliner&rsquo;s apprentice, perhaps&mdash;but she must remember that I expect  her to support herself, and that she must not look to me for any further  assistance. I have performed my duty to my father at a considerable loss to  myself, but with his death all claim upon me ceases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Vane had been buried during the early days of his  youngest daughter&rsquo;s illness. They placed him amongst a cluster of neglected  graves, in a patch of ground upon the outskirts of P&egrave;re la Chaise, and Richard  Thornton ordered a roughly hewn cross from one of the stonemasons near the  cemetery. So, far away from the lofty monuments of the Russian princes and the  marshals of the First Empire; far away from Abelard and Heloise, and all the  marble chapels in which devoted survivors pray for the souls of the beloved  dead; in a desolate and unhallowed patch of weedy turf, where the bones of the  departed were only suffered to rest peaceably for a given number of years, and  were stirred up out of their coffins periodically to make room for new-comers,  George Vane slept the last sleep. He might have been buried as a nameless suicide  but for the chance which had taken Richard Thornton to the Morgue, where he  recognised Eleanor&rsquo;s father in the unknown dead man who had been last brought  to that gloomy shelter; for he had had no papers which could give any clue to  his identity about him at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Upon the morning after that quiet September afternoon on which  Eleanor Vane had learned the true story of her father&rsquo;s death, Signora  Picirillo for the first time spoke seriously of the future. In the intensity of  her first great grief, Eleanor Vane had never once thought of the desolation of  her position, nor yet of the sacrifices which the Signora and Richard were  making for her sake. She never remembered that they were both lingering in Paris solely on her  account; she only knew that they were there, and that she saw them daily, and  that the sight of them, good and kind as they were, was pain and weariness to  her, like the sight of everything else in the world.</p>
<p>She had been singularly quiet since the revelation made to her.  After the first burst of passionate vehemence which had succeeded her perusal  of her dead father&rsquo;s letter, her manner had grown&nbsp;almost unnaturally calm.  She had sat all the evening apart near the window, and Richard had tried in  vain to beguile her attention even for a moment. She kept silence, brooding  upon the scrap of paper which lay in her bosom.</p>
<p>This morning she sat in a listless attitude, with her head  resting on her hand. She took no heed of the Signora&rsquo;s busy movements from room  to room. She made no effort to give her old friend any assistance in all the  little household arrangements which took so long to complete, and when at last  the music-mistress brought her needle-work to the window, and sat down opposite  the invalid, Eleanor looked up at her with a dull weary gaze that struck  despair to the good creature&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nelly, my dear,&rdquo; the Signora said, briskly, &ldquo;I want to have a  little serious conversation with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what, dear Signora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the future, my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane uttered the word almost as if it had been  meaningless to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear. You see even I can talk hopefully of the future,  though I am an old woman; but you, who are only fifteen, have a long life  before you, and it is time you began to look forward to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do look forward,&rdquo; Eleanor said, with a gloomy expression upon  her face. &ldquo;I do look forward to the future; and to meeting that man, the man  who caused my father&rsquo;s death. How am I to find him, Signora? Help me in that.  You have been kind to me in everything else. Only help me to do that and I will  love you better than ever I have loved you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Signora shook her head. She was a light-hearted, energetic  creature, who had borne very heavy burdens through a long life; but the burdens  had not been able to crush her. Perhaps her unselfishness had upheld her  throughout all her trials. She had thought and cared so much for other people,  that she had had little time left for thinking of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Eleanor,&rdquo; she said, gravely, &ldquo;this will never do. You must  not be influenced by that fatal letter. Your poor father had no right to lay  the responsibility of his own act upon another man. If he chose to stake this  unfortunate money upon the hazard of a pack of cards, and lost it, he had no  right to charge this man with the consequences of his own folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the man cheated him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As your father thought. People are very apt to fancy themselves  cheated when they lose money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa would never have written so positively, if he had  not&nbsp;<i>known</i>&nbsp;that the man cheated him. Besides, Richard says they  were heard at high words; that was no doubt when my poor dear father accused  this wretch of being a cheat. He and his companion were wicked, scheming men,  who had good reason to hide their names. They were pitiless wretches, who had  no compassion upon the poor old man who trusted them and believed in their  honour. Are&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;going to defend them, Signora Picirillo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defend them, Eleanor? no: they were bad men, I have no doubt.  But, my darling child, you must not begin life with hatred and vengeance in  your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hate the man who caused my father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; cried Eleanor  Vane. &ldquo;Do you think I shall ever cease to hate him, Signora? Do you think that  I shall ever forget to pray that the day may come when he and I will stand face  to face, and that he may be as helpless and as dependent upon my mercy as my  father was on his? Heaven help him on that day! But I don&rsquo;t want to talk of  this, Signora: what is the use of talking? I may be an old woman, perhaps,  before I meet this man, but surely, surely I shall meet him sooner or later. If  I only knew his name&mdash;if I only knew his name, I think I could trace him from  one end of the earth to the other. Robert Lan&mdash;Lan&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head sank forward on her breast, and her eyes fixed  themselves dreamily on the sunlit street below the open window. The French  poodle, Fido, lay at her feet, and lifted up his head every now and then to  lick her hand. The animal had missed his master, and had wandered about the  little rooms, sniffing on the thresholds of closed doors, and moaning dismally  for several days after Mr. Vane&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>The Signora sighed as she watched Eleanor. What was she to do  with this girl, who had taken a horrible vendetta upon herself at fifteen years  of age, and who seemed as gloomily absorbed in her scheme of vengeance as any  Corsican chieftain?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; the music-mistress said presently, with rather a  sharp accent, &ldquo;do you know that Richard and I will be compelled to leave Paris to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave Paris  to-morrow, Signora!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The Ph&oelig;nix opens early in October, and our Dick will have  all the scenes to paint for the new piece. Besides, there are my pupils; you  know, my love, they cannot be kept together for ever unless I go back to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane looked up with almost a bewildered expression, as  if she had been trying to comprehend all that Signora Picirillo had said; then  suddenly a light seemed to dawn upon her, and she rose from her chair and flung  herself upon a carpeted hassock at the feet of her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Signora,&rdquo; she said, clasping the music-mistress&rsquo;s hand in  both her own, &ldquo;how wicked and ungrateful I have been all this time! I forget  everything but myself and my own trouble. You came over to Paris on my account. You told me so when I  was ill, but I had forgotten, I had forgotten; and Richard has stopped in Paris because of me. Oh,  what can I do to repay you both, what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor hid her face upon the Signora&rsquo;s lap, and wept silently.  Those tears did her good; they beguiled her for a little while, at least, from  the one absorbing thought of her father&rsquo;s melancholy fate.</p>
<p>Signora Picirillo tenderly smoothed the soft ripples of auburn  hair lying on her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Eleanor, shall I tell you what you can do to make us  both very happy, and to repay&nbsp;us tenfold for any little sacrifice we may  have made on your account?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to choose your pathway in life, Nelly, and to choose  it quickly. In all the world you have only your half-sisters and brothers to  whom you can appeal for assistance. You have some claim upon them, you know,  dear, but I sometimes think you are too proud to avail yourself of that claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane lifted her head with a gesture of superb defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would starve rather than accept a penny from Mrs. Bannister,  or from her sister or brothers. If they had been different, my father would  never have died as he did. He was deserted and abandoned by all the world, poor  dear, except his helpless child, who could do nothing to save him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t mean to apply to Mrs. Bannister, what will you  do, Nelly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane shook her head hopelessly. The whole fabric of the  future had been shattered by her father&rsquo;s desperate act. The simple dream of a  life in which she was to have worked for that beloved father was over, and it  seemed to Eleanor as if the future existed no longer: there was only the sad,  desolate present,&mdash;a dreary spot in the great desert of life, bounded by a  yawning grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me what I mean to do, Signora?&rdquo; she said  piteously. &ldquo;How does it matter what I do? Nothing I can do will bring my father  back. I will stay in Paris,  and get my living how I can, and look for the man who murdered my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor,&rdquo; cried the Signora, &ldquo;are you mad? How could you stay  in Paris, when  you don&rsquo;t know one living creature in the whole city? How, in mercy&rsquo;s name,  could you get your living in this strange place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could be a nursery-governess or a nursery-maid; anything!  What do I care how low I sink, if I can only stay here, where I am likely to  meet that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor, my dear! For pity&rsquo;s sake do not delude yourself in  this manner. The man you want to find is an adventurer, no doubt. In Paris one day, in London  another, or away in America  perhaps, or at the further extremity of the globe. Do you hope to find this man  by walking about the streets of Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you expect to meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Eleanor, be reasonable. It is utterly impossible that you  can remain in Paris.  If Mrs. Bannister does not claim the right of exercising some authority over  you, I claim it as your oldest friend. My dear, you will not refuse to listen  to me, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, dear Signora. If you think I mustn&rsquo;t stay in Paris, I&rsquo;ll go back to England, to the Miss Bennetts.  They&rsquo;ll give me fifteen pounds a-year as junior teacher. I may as well live  with them, if I mustn&rsquo;t stay here. I must earn some money, I suppose, before I  can even try to find the man who caused my father&rsquo;s death. How long it will be  before I can earn anything worth speaking of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed wearily, and fell again into a gloomy silence, from  which the poodle vainly tried to arouse her by many affectionate devices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may consider it settled, Nelly, my dear,&rdquo; the Signora  said, cheerfully. &ldquo;You will leave Paris  to-morrow morning, with Richard and me. You can stay with us, my dear, till  you&rsquo;ve made up your mind what to do. We&rsquo;ve a little spare room, which is only  used now as a receptacle for empty boxes and Richard&rsquo;s painting litter. We&rsquo;ll  fit it up for you, my darling, and make you as comfortable as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear Signora!&rdquo; said Eleanor, kneeling by her friend&rsquo;s  chair. &ldquo;How good you are to me. But while I have been ill there must have been  a great deal of money spent: for the doctor, and the jelly, and fruit and  lemonade you have given me&mdash;who found the money, Signora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister, Mrs. Bannister, my dear; she sent some money in  answer to a letter from Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s face crimsoned suddenly, and the music-mistress  understood the meaning of that angry flush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard didn&rsquo;t ask for any money, my love. He only wrote to  tell your sister what had happened. She sent money for all necessary expenses.  It is not all gone yet, Nelly; there will be enough to pay your journey back to  England;  and even then something left. I have kept an account of all that has been  spent, and will give it to you when you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor looked down at her white morning-gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there enough left to buy a black frock?&rdquo; she asked, in a low  voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my darling. I have thought of that. I have had mourning  made for you. The dressmaker took one of your muslin frocks for a pattern, so  there was no occasion to trouble you about the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good you are to me, how very, very good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane could only say this. As yet she only dimly felt how  much she owed to these people, who were bound to her by no tie of relationship,  and who yet stepped aside from their own difficult pathway to do her service in  her sorrow. She could not learn to cling to them, and depend upon them yet. She  had loved them long ago, in her father&rsquo;s lifetime; but now that he was dead,  every link that had bound her to life, and love, and happiness, seemed suddenly  severed, and she stood alone, groping blindly in the thick darkness of a new  and dreary world, with only one light shining far away at the end of a  wearisome and obscure pathway, and that a lurid and fatal star, that beckoned  her onward to some unknown deed of hate and vengeance.</p>
<p>Heaven knows what vague scheme of retribution she cherished in  her childish ignorance of the world. Perhaps she formed her ideas of life from  the numerous novels she had read, in which the villain was always confounded in  the last chapter, however triumphant he might be through two volumes and  three-quarters of successful iniquity.</p>
<p>George Vane&rsquo;s sanguine and romantic visions of wealth and  grandeur, of retaliation upon those who had neglected and forgotten him, had  not been without effect upon the mind of his youngest daughter. That plastic  mind had been entirely in the old man&rsquo;s hands, to mould in what form he  pleased. Himself entirely the slave of impulse, it was not to be supposed that  he could teach his daughter those sound principles without which man, like a  rudderless vessel, floats hither and thither before every current in the sea of  life. He suffered Eleanor&rsquo;s impulsive nature to have full sway; he put no curb  upon the sanguine temperament which took everything in the extreme. As blindly  as the girl loved her father, so blindly she was ready to hate those whom he  called his enemies. To investigate the nature of the wrongs they had done him  would have been to take their side in the quarrel. Reason and Love could not go  hand-in-hand in Eleanor&rsquo;s creed; for the questions which Reason might ask would  be so many treacheries against Love.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered, then, that she held the few broken  sentences written by her father, on the threshold of a shameful death, as a  solemn and sacred trust not to be violated or lost sight of, though her future  life should be sacrificed to the fulfilment of one purpose.</p>
<p>Such thoughts as these, indistinct, ignorant, and childish,  perhaps, but not the less absorbing, filled her mind. It may be that this new  purpose of revenge, enabled her the better to endure her loss. She had  something to live for, at least. There was a light far away athwart the long  gloomy pathway through an unknown world, and, however lurid that guiding star  might be, it was better than total darkness.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter  10<br>
  Hortensia Bannister Holds Out A Helping Hand</b></h2>
<p>Signora Picirillo&nbsp;was very well contented with her  morning&rsquo;s work. She had obtained Eleanor&rsquo;s consent to a speedy departure from Paris; that was the grand  point. Once away from the scene of the terrible catastrophe of George Vane&rsquo;s  death, the young girl&rsquo;s sunshiny nature would reassert itself, and little by  little the great grief would be forgotten.</p>
<p>In all this dreary period of sickness and misery the good  music-mistress had grown to love Mr. Vane&rsquo;s daughter even more than she had  loved her long ago, when Eleanor&rsquo;s childish fingers had first stumbled slowly  over the keys of the pianoforte, in a feeble endeavour to master the grand  difficulties of Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow&rsquo;s life had been a very sorrowful one. Perhaps its most  tranquil period had come within the last ten years. It was ten years since, her  Italian husband and her children having one by one died, she had found herself  alone in the world, with a gaunt, long-legged hobadahoy of eighteen, her dead  sister&rsquo;s orphan son, for her sole protector.</p>
<p>This long-legged hobadahoy was Richard Thornton, the only child  of the Signora&rsquo;s pretty younger sister and a dashing cavalry officer, who had  married a penniless and obscure girl for the love of her pretty face, and had  died within a couple of years of his marriage, leaving his widow to drag out  the remnant of a fretful, helpless life in dependence upon her sister. The  Signora had been used to carrying other people&rsquo;s burdens from a very early  age. She was the eldest child of a clever violinist, who had been for twenty  years leader of the orchestra in one of the principal London theatres; and from babyhood had been a  brave-hearted, self-reliant creature. When her sister died, therefore, and with  the last words upon her pale, tremulous lips prayed the Signora to protect the  helpless boy, Richard Thornton, Eliza Picirillo freely accepted the charge, and  promised to perform it faithfully. The poor faded beauty died with a smile upon  her face, and when Signor Picirillo&mdash;who was a teacher of languages at a few  suburban schools, and a lazy, good-tempered&nbsp;nonenity&mdash;came home that  evening, he found that there was to be another member of his domestic circle,  and another mouth to be fed henceforth.</p>
<p>The Signora&rsquo;s cruse of oil held out bravely, in spite of the  demands upon it; and by-and-by, when the honest-hearted music-mistress would  otherwise have been terribly desolate, there was Richard, a tall lad, ready to  stand by her sturdily in the battle of life, and as devoted to her as the most  affectionate of sons. The boy had shown considerable talent at a very early  age, but it was a versatile kind of talent which did not promise ever to burst  forth into the grander gift of genius. His aunt taught him music, and he taught  himself painting, intending to be something in the way of Maclise or Turner  by-and-by, and scraping together some of the shillings he earned with his  violin in order to attend a dingy academy somewhere in Bloomsbury.</p>
<p>But the great historical subjects after Maclise&mdash;&ldquo;The Death of  the Bloody Boar at Bosworth,&rdquo; a grand battle scene, with a lurid sunset in the  background, and Richmond&rsquo;s face and armour all ablaze with crimson lake and  gamboge, from the flaming reflection of the skies, was the&nbsp;<i>magnum opus</i>&nbsp;which  poor Dick fondly hoped to see in the Royal Academy&mdash;were not very saleable; and  the Turneresque landscapes, nymphs and ruins, dryads and satyrs, dimly visible  through yellow mist and rose-coloured fog, cost a great deal of time and money  to produce, and were not easily convertible into ready cash. So, when Richard  had gone the usual weary round amongst the picture-dealers, and had endured the  usual heart-burnings and agonies which wait upon ambitious youth, he was glad  to accept the brush flung aside by a scene-painter at the Ph&oelig;nix, where Dick  received a scanty salary as second violinist; a salary which was doubled when  the young man practised the double duty of second violin and assistant  scene-painter.</p>
<p>These simple people were the only friends of Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s  childhood. They were ready to accept the responsibility of her future welfare  now, when her rich sister would have sent her into the world, lonely and  helpless, to sink to the abject drudgery which well-to-do people speak so  complacently of, when they recommend their poor relations to get an honest  living and trouble them no longer.</p>
<p>Richard Thornton was enraptured at the idea of taking this  beautiful younger sister home with him, although that idea involved the  necessity of working for her till she was able to do something for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be better for us than all this sad business,  aunty,&rdquo; the young scene-painter said when he called in the Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que,  and found his aunt alone in the little sitting-room. Eleanor was lying down  after the morning&rsquo;s excitement, while her friend packed her slender wardrobe  and made all preparations for departure. &ldquo;Nothing could be better for us,&rdquo; the  young man said. &ldquo;Why, Nell&rsquo;s golden hair will light up the Pilasters with  perpetual sunshine, and I shall always have a model for my subject-pictures.  Then what a companion she&rsquo;ll be for you in the long dreary nights when I am  away at the Ph&oelig;nix, and how capitally she&rsquo;ll be able to help you with your  pupils; for, of course, she plays and sings, like anything, by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she wants to go back to the Miss Bennetts, the people at  the Brixton school, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Lord bless you, aunty, we won&rsquo;t let her go,&rdquo; cried Mr.  Thornton; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make a prima donna or a leading tragedy-actress, or something  of that kind, of her. We&rsquo;ll teach her to make a hundred pounds a-week out of  her white arms and her flashing gray eyes. How beautiful she looked last night  when she was on her knees, vowing vengeance against that scoundrel who won her  father&rsquo;s money, with her yellow hair all streaming over her shoulders, and her  eyes flashing sparks of fire! Wouldn&rsquo;t she bring the house down, if she did  that at the Ph&oelig;nix? She&rsquo;s a wonderful girl, aunty; the sort of girl to set all London in a blaze some  day, somehow or other. Miss Bennett&rsquo;s and Brixton, indeed!&rdquo; cried Richard,  snapping his fingers contemptuously, &ldquo;you could no more chain that girl down to  a governess&rsquo;s drudgery, than you could make a flash of forked lightning do duty  for a farthing candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Eleanor Vane went back to England with her friends. They  chose the Dieppe and Brighton  route for its economy; and over the same sunlit landscape upon which she had  gazed so rapturously less than a month ago, Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes wandered now wearily  and sadly, seeing nothing but desolation wherever they looked. She recognised  swelling hills and broad patches of low verdure, winding glimpses of the river,  far-away villages glimmering whitely in the distance, and she wondered at the  change in herself which made all these things so different to her. What a child  she had been a month ago; what a reckless, happy child, looking forward in  foolish certainty to a long life with her father, ignorant of all sorrows  except the petty troubles she had shared with him, ready to hope for anything  in the boundless future, with a whole fairy-land of pleasure and delight  spreading out before her eager feet!</p>
<p>Now she was a woman, alone in a horrible desert, over whose  dreary sands she must crawl slowly and wearily to the end she hoped to reach.</p>
<p>She sat back in a corner of the second-class carriage with her  face hidden in a veil, and with the dog Fido curled up in her lap. Her father  had been fond of the faithful creature, she remembered.</p>
<p>It was early in the gray bleakness of a September morning when  the cab, carrying Eleanor and her friends, rattled under an archway leading out  of Dudley Street,  Bloomsbury, into the queer little retreat  called the Pilasters. The grooms were already at work in the mews, and the  neighbourhood was enlivened by that hissing noise with which horses are  generally beguiled during the trials of the equine toilet. The chimney-sweep  had left his abode and was whooping dismally in Northumberland Square. Life began early  in the Pilasters, and already the inmates of many houses were astir, and the  sharp voices of mothers clamoured denunciations on the elder daughters who  acted as unsalaried nursemaids to the younger branches of the family.</p>
<p>The place popularly known as the Pilasters is one of the  queerest nooks in London.  It consists of a row of tumble-down houses, fronted by a dilapidated colonnade,  and filled with busy life from cellar to attic. But I do not believe that the  inhabitants of the Pilasters are guilty of nefarious practices, or that vice  and crime find a hiding-place in the cellars below the colonnade. The retreat  stands by itself, hidden between two highly respectable middle-class streets,  whose inhabitants would scarcely tolerate Alsatian habits or Field Lane proclivities in their near  neighbours. Small tradesmen find a home in the Pilasters, and emerge thence to  work for the best families in Dudley    Street and &ldquo;the Squares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, amongst small tailors and mantua-makers, cheap  eating-houses, shabby beer-shops, chimney-sweeps and mangles, Signora Picirillo  had taken up her abode, bringing her faded goods and chattels, the remnants of  brighter times, to furnish the first-floor over a shoemaker&rsquo;s shop. I am afraid  the shoemaker was oftener employed in mending old shoes than in making new  ones, but the Signora was fain to ignore that fact, and to be contented with  her good fortune in having found a very cheap lodging in a central  neighbourhood.</p>
<p>This was a shabbier place than any that Eleanor Vane had ever  lived in, but she showed no distaste for its simple arrangements. The Signora&rsquo;s  hopes were realised by-and-by. At first the girl sat all day in a despondent  attitude, with the French poodle in her lap, her head drooping on her breast,  her eyes fixed on vacancy, her whole manner giving evidence of an all-absorbing  grief which was nearly akin to despair. She went to Brixton very soon after her  return to England;  but here a very cruel disappointment awaited her. The Misses Bennett heard her  sorrowful story with pitiful murmurs of regret and compassion, but they had  engaged a young person as junior teacher, and could do nothing to help her. She  returned to the Pilasters, looking the image of pale despair; but the Signora  and Richard both declared to her that nothing could be happier for them than  her consenting to remain with them.</p>
<p>So it seemed very much as if the Pilasters was to be Eleanor  Vane&rsquo;s permanent abode. The neighbours had stared at her a great deal at first,  admiring her pale face and flowing hair, and&nbsp;pitying her because of her  black frock; but they were familiar with her now, and gave her good day in a  friendly manner as she passed under the shadow of the colonnade on her way out  or in.</p>
<p>Little by little the air of dull despondency gave way before  this young woman&rsquo;s earnest desire to be of use to the people who were so kind  to her. She played remarkably well, for she had had plenty of the drudgery of  pianoforte-playing at the Brixton school, and she was able to take some of the  Signora&rsquo;s pupils off her hands. She sang, too, in a rich contralto, which  promised to be powerful and beautiful by-and-by; and she practised the ballads  in the old operas which the Signora kept, neatly bound, but yellow with age, in  her feeble music-stand.</p>
<p>As her friends had hoped, her sunshiny nature re-asserted  itself. The outer evidences of her great sorrow gradually passed away, though  the memory of her loss still filled her mind; the image of her father, and the  thought of that father&rsquo;s unhappy death, were still for ever present with her.  It was not in her nature to be long reserved or unsocial; and by-and-by, when  she had been nearly six months in her new home, and the London sparrows were  chirping in the bright spring sunshine about the mews and under the colonnade,  Miss Vane began to sing at her work as she flitted to and fro in the low rooms,  dusting the grand pianoforte and the old china&mdash;touching up the frame of  Richard&rsquo;s unsaleable picture, the flaring Battle of Bosworth, which illuminated  one side of the room. Wherever she went the faithful French poodle ran frisking  by her side; whatever sunshine could find its way into the dusky London chamber seemed to  concentrate itself about her golden head. Gaiety, life, and brightness, went  with her up and down the dark staircase&mdash;in and out of the dingy rooms. Her  youth and beauty turned the shabby lodging into a fairy palace, as it seemed to  Richard and his aunt. When she sat down and ran her agile fingers over the  piano, dashing into fantasias and scenas, sparkling and rippling with joyous  treble meanderings among the upper notes, the old Clementi grew young again  beneath her touch, the worn-out strings were revivified by the wondrous  magnetism of her youth and vitality. The flute-like treble trills and triplets  seemed like the joyous chirpings of a hundred birds. The music-mistress and the  scene-painter used to sit and watch her as she played; their admiring eyes  followed her as she flitted to and fro, and they wondered at her grace and  beauty.</p>
<p>She had her father&rsquo;s aristocratic elegance, her father&rsquo;s power  of fascination. All the dangerous gifts which had been so fatal to George Vane,  were inherited by his youngest daughter. Like him, a creature of impulse,  spontaneous, sanguine, volatile, she influenced other people by the force of  her own superabundant vitality. In her bright hopefulness she made an  atmosphere of hope in which other people grew hopeful. The dullest rejoiced in  her joyous vivacity, her unconscious loveliness. Yes, perhaps Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s  greatest charm lay in her utter ignorance of the fact that she was charming. In  the three years&rsquo; drudgery of a boarding-school she had never learned the power  of her own fascination. She knew that people loved her, and she was grateful to  them for their affection; but she had never discovered that it was by some  wondrous magnetic attraction inherent in herself, that she obtained so much  love and devotion.</p>
<p>Nobody had ever taken the trouble to tell her that she was  beautiful. She had generally worn shabby frocks, and the rippling golden hair  had not very often been smooth, so perhaps the school-girls at Brixton scarcely  knew how lovely their companion was. The delicate aquiline profile, the  flashing gray eyes, pale face, red lips and amber hair, were counterbalanced by  the silk dresses and lace furbelows of young ladies, whose wealthy fathers paid  full price for their education. Poverty learns its place in the little world of  a young ladies&rsquo; boarding-school quite as surely as in the larger world beyond  the garden wall which bounds that establishment. But Eleanor had held her own  at the Misses Bennett&rsquo;s seminary by some mysterious power against which her  richer companions had in vain rebelled. Her frank acknowledgment of her  poverty, coupled with the fact of her father&rsquo;s former wealth and grandeur,  perhaps enabled her to do this. If she wore shabby frocks, she looked more  aristocratic in her shabbiness than the other young ladies in their stiff silks  and prim finery. They recognised this fact, they acknowledged something in  their playfellow which lifted her above themselves, and the half-boarder dealt  out patronage and regal condescensions to the most remunerative pupils in the  school. She reigned by reason of her unacknowledged beauty, and that divine  something, dimly recognised by all about her, but as yet wholly undeveloped.  The school-girl was clever, brilliant, fascinating, but it was yet to be  discovered what the woman would be. It was yet to be discovered whether these  budding qualities would develop into the many flowers of a bright and versatile  mind, or burst forth suddenly and mysteriously into that rare tropical blossom,  that mental once-in-a-century flourishing aloe, which men call Genius. The good  music-mistress watched her young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e with love and wonder, not unalloyed  by fear. What was she to do with this strange and beautiful bird which she had  brought home to her nest? Would it be right to fetter this bright spirit for  ever? Was it fair to immure all this joyous loveliness in that shabby lodging;  to stifle such superabundant vitality in the close atmosphere of a dull and  monotonous existence?</p>
<p>The faithful creature had been accustomed to consider others,  and she thought of this seriously and constantly. Eleanor was contented and  happy. She was earning money now by giving lessons here and there, and she  contributed to the family purse. The days slipped by very rapidly, as it  seemed, in that peaceful monotony. Miss Vane&rsquo;s frocks appeared to grow shorter  and shorter as the young lady sprang up into bright womanhood. She was nearly  seventeen now, and had been more than a year and a half living under the shadow  of the Bloomsbury Pilasters. Richard and his aunt consulted together as to what  her future life ought to be; but they never came nearer to any conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to talk of her going away&nbsp;from us, you  know, aunty,&rdquo; the scene-painter said; &ldquo;but what are we to do without her? All  the sunshine and poetry of our lives will go away with her when she leaves us!  Besides! what is she to be? A governess? Bah! who would doom her to that  ladylike drudgery? An actress? No, aunty carissima, I should never like to see  that bright young beauty behind the glare of the foot-lights. I think I&rsquo;d  rather she should live here for ever and ever, than that her nature should ever  be vulgarised by contact with the world. Let us keep her, aunty; she doesn&rsquo;t  want to leave us. Those who have any actual claim upon her have abandoned her.  She came across my pathway like some wandering homeless angel. I shall never  forget her face when I first saw it on the lamplit boulevard, and recognised  the little girl I had known three years before in the fair-haired young beauty  of fifteen. She doesn&rsquo;t want to go away. Why should you talk of her leaving us,  aunty dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Signora Picirillo shrugged her shoulders with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows I have no wish to part with her, Dick,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;but we ought to do what&rsquo;s right for her sake. This is no place for George  Vane&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while the music-mistress and her nephew were speculating and  theorising upon the future of their prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, practical Mrs. Bannister was  contemplating the infliction of a death-blow which was to shatter the happiness  of the humble Bloomsbury circle with one  merciless stroke. Early in the bleak March of 1855, Eleanor received a  coldly-worded epistle from her half-sister, to the effect that an opportunity  had now arisen for her advancement in life; and that if she wished ever to  attain a&nbsp;<i>respectable</i>&nbsp;position&mdash;the adjective was mercilessly  underlined&mdash;she would do well to avail herself of it. For further information  and advice she was to call early the next morning in Hyde Park Gardens.  Miss Vane would fain have left this letter unanswered, and at first stoutly refused  to obey Mrs. Bannister&rsquo;s summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want with her condescension and patronage?&rdquo; she said,  indignantly. &ldquo;Does she think that I forget the cruel letter she wrote to my  father; or that I forgive her for its heartless insolence? Let her keep her  favours for those who solicit them. I want nothing from her. I only want to be  left in peace with the friends I love. Do you want to get rid of me, Signora,  that you persuade me to dance attendance upon Mrs. Bannister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very hard for poor Signora Picirillo to be compelled to  urge the child&rsquo;s acceptance of the hand so coldly extended to her, but the good  creature felt that it was her duty to do so, and Miss Vane loved her  protectress far too dearly to persist in opposing her. She went, therefore, early  the next morning to her half-sister&rsquo;s house at Bayswater, where the spacious  rooms seemed doubly spacious when compared with the little sitting-room over  the colonnade, the sitting-room which was more than half filled by Clementi&rsquo;s  old-fashioned piano. Here the gorgeous Erard&rsquo;s grand, in a case of carved  walnut wood and ebony, and with all manner of newfangled improvements, was only  an oasis upon the great desert of splendid Brussels carpet.</p>
<p>Hortensia Bannister was pleased to be very gracious to her half-sister.  Perhaps she was all the more so because Eleanor made no pretence of affection  for her. This cold, hard-natured woman would have been suspicious of mercenary  motives lurking beneath any demonstration of sisterly love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you have been learning to get your own  living, Eleanor,&rdquo; she said,&ldquo;and above all, that you have been cultivating your  talent for the piano. I have not forgotten you, you will find. The people with  whom you have been living sent me their address when they brought you from Paris, and I knew where  to find you when any opportunity should present itself for your advancement.  This opportunity has now presented itself. My old acquaintance, Mrs. Darrell,  the niece of your father&rsquo;s friend, Maurice de Crespigny, who is still living,  though very old and infirm, has written to me saying that she requires a young  person who would act as companion and musical governess to a lady who lives  with her. This young lady is no relation of Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s, but is a kind of  ward or pupil, I believe. Your youth, in this instance, Eleanor, happens to be  an advantage, as the young lady requires a companion of her own age. You will  receive a moderate salary, and will be treated as a member of the family. Let  me hear you play, by-the-by, that I may be able to speak positively as to your  qualifications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Vane sat down to the piano. The strings of the Erard  vibrated under her touch. She was almost frightened at the grand tones that  came out of the instrument as she dashed over the keys. She played very  brilliantly, however, and her sister condescended to say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I may conscientiously give a good account of your  playing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You sing, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; I think you may consider the engagement a  settled thing. There is only one question to arrange. Of course you must be  aware that the position which your father occupied was once a very elevated  one. His most intimate friend was Mr. de Crespigny, the uncle of the lady whose  house I wish you to enter. Under these circumstances you cannot wonder when I  tell you that I should strongly object to Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s knowing who you really  are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, Hortensia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that I shall recommend you as a young person in whose  career I feel interested. If you go to Hazlewood at all, you must go under an  assumed name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hortensia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bannister, lifting her handsome black  eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want this situation, and I should hate to take a false  name. I would rather stay with my friends, please. I love them very dearly, and  am very happy with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bannister, &ldquo;what is the use of  trying to do some people a&nbsp;service? Here have I been scheming as to how I  could manage to avail myself of this chance, and now this ungrateful girl turns  round and tells me she doesn&rsquo;t want the situation. Do you know what you are  refusing, Eleanor Vane? Have you learnt your father&rsquo;s habit of pauperism, that  you prefer to be a burden upon this penniless music-teacher and her son, or  nephew, or whatever he is, rather than make an honest effort to get your own  living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor started up from the piano: she had been sitting before  it until now, softly fingering the white ivory keys, and admiring the beauty of  the tones. She started up, looking at her sister, and blushing indignantly to  the very roots of her golden hair.</p>
<p>Could this be true? Could she be indeed a burden to the friends  she loved so dearly?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think that, Hortensia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you think I am any  burden to the dear Signora, or Richard, I will take any situation you like,  however hard. I&rsquo;ll toil night and day, and work my fingers to the bone, rather  than be a trouble or a burden to them any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remembered how little she earned by her few pupils. Yes,  Hortensia was no doubt right. She was a burden to those good people who had  taken her to their home in her hour of desolation and misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the situation, Hortensia,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a  false name. I&rsquo;ll do anything in the world rather than impose upon the goodness of  my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Bannister, coldly. &ldquo;Pray do not let  us have any heroics about it. The situation is a very good one, I can assure  you, and there are many girls who would be glad to snap at such a chance. I  will write to my friend, Mrs. Darrell, and recommend you to her notice. I can  do no more. I cannot, of course, ensure you success; but Ellen Darrell and I  were great friends some years since, and I know that I have considerable  influence with her. I&rsquo;ll write and tell you the result of my recommendation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor left Hyde    Park Gardens  after taking two or three sips of some pale sherry which her half-sister gave  her. The wine seemed of a sorry vintage, and tasted very much as if the grapes  of which it was made had never seen the sun. Miss Vane was glad to set down her  wine-glass and escape from the cold splendour of her half-sister&rsquo;s  drawing-room.</p>
<p>She walked slowly and sorrowfully back to Bloomsbury.  She was to leave her dear friends there; leave the shabby rooms in which she  had been so happy, and to go out into the bleak world a dependent upon grand  people, so low and humiliated that even her own name must be abandoned by her  before she could enter upon the state of dependence. The Bohemian sociality of  the Pilasters was to be exchanged for the dreary splendour of a household in  which she was to be something a little above the servants.</p>
<p>But it would be cowardly and selfish to refuse this situation,  for no doubt cruel Mrs. Bannister had spoken the truth. She had been a burden  upon her poor friends.</p>
<p>She was very gloomy and despondent, thinking of these things,  but through every gloomy thought of the present a darker image loomed far away  in the black future. This was the image of her vengeance, the vague and  uncertain shadow that had filled her girlish dreams ever since the great sorrow  of her father&rsquo;s death had fallen upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go to Hazlewood,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;if I spend my life at Mrs.  Darrell&rsquo;s, how can I ever hope to find the murderer of my father?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Richard Thornton&rsquo;s Promise</b></h2>
<p>Eleanor Vane looked very sadly at all the common, every-day sights  connected with the domestic economy of the Pilasters, when she went back to Bloomsbury, after her interview with Mrs. Bannister. She had  only lived a year and a-half in that humble locality, but it was in her nature to  become quickly attached to places as well as persons, and she had grown very fond  of the Pilasters. Everybody about the place knew her and loved her. The horses looked  out of their open stable-doors as she passed; the dogs came tumbling from their  kennels, dragging half-a-dozen yards of rusty iron chain and a heap of straw at  their heels, to greet her as she went by; the chimney-sweeps&rsquo; children courted her  notice; and at all the little shops where she had been wont to give orders and pay  bills for the Signora, the simple tradespeople tendered her their admiration and  homage. Her beauty was a pride to the worthy citizens of the Pilasters. Could all  Bloomsbury, from Dudley Street to the Squares, produce sunnier  golden hair or brighter gray eyes than were to be seen under the shadow of the dilapidated  colonnade when Eleanor Vane went by?</p>
<p>In this  atmosphere of love and admiration, the girl had been very happy. She had one of  those natures in which there lies a wondrous power of assimilation with the manners  and habits of others. She was never out of place; she was never in the way. She  was not ambitious. Her sunny temperament was the centre of perpetual peace and happiness,  only to be disturbed by very terrible thunder-claps of grief and trouble. She had  been very happy with the Signora; and to-day, when she looked round the little sitting-room,  her eyes resting sadly now on the old piano, now on a shelf of tattered books, romances  dear to Richard and herself, and not too well treated by either; now on the young  man&rsquo;s flaming <i>magnum opus</i>, the picture she had loved to criticise and abuse  in mischievous enjoyment of the painter&rsquo;s anguish; now as she looked at these things,  and remembered how soon she must go away from them, the slow tears trickled down  her cheeks, and she stood hopeless, despondent on the gloomy threshold of her new  life.</p>
<p>She  had found the familiar rooms empty upon her return from Bayswater, for the Signora  was away teaching beyond the regions of the New Road, and Richard was hard at work at  the Ph&oelig;nix, where there were always new pieces to be produced and new scenes to  be painted. Eleanor had the little sitting-room all to herself; she took off her  bonnet and sat down upon the old-fashioned chintz-covered sofa. She buried her head  in the cushions and tried to think.</p>
<p>The  prospect of a new existence, which would have been delightful to most girls of her  age, was utterly distasteful to her. Her nature was adhesive; she would have gone  to the furthest end of the world with her father if he had lived, or with Richard  and the Signora, whom she loved only less than she had loved him. But to sever every  tie, and go out alone into the world with nothing between her and desolation, was  unspeakably terrible to this affectionate, impulsive girl.</p>
<p>If it  had been simply a question of her own advantage, if by the sacrifice of her own  advancement, her every prospect in life, she might have stayed with the friends  she loved, she would not have hesitated for a moment. But it was not so. Mrs. Bannister  had clearly told her that she was a burden upon these generous people who had sheltered  and succoured her in her hour of misery. The cruel word pauperism had been flung  in her teeth, and with a racking brain this poor girl set herself to calculate how  much her maintenance cost her friends, and how much she was able to contribute out  of her own pitiful earnings.</p>
<p>Alas!  the balance told against her when the sum was done. Her earnings were very, very  small as yet; not because her talent was unappreciated, but because her pupils were  poor, and a music-mistress, whose address was Bloomsbury Pilasters, could scarcely  demand high payment for her services, or hope to obtain a very aristocratic connection.</p>
<p>No,  Mrs. Bannister&mdash;stern, uncompromising, and disagreeable as the truth itself&mdash;had no  doubt been right. Her duty lay before her, plainly indicated by that unpleasant  monitor. She was bound to leave these dear friends, and to go out into the world  to fight a lonely battle for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may  be able to do something for them,&rdquo; she thought; and this thought was the only gleam  of light which illumined the darkness of her sorrow. &ldquo;I may be able to save money  enough to buy the Signora a black silk dress, and Richard a meerschaum. I should  so like to buy Dick a meerschaum; I know the one he&rsquo;d like&mdash;a bull-dog&rsquo;s head, with  a silver collar round the neck. We looked at it one night at a shop in Holborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  rose from the sofa at last with an aching heart and troubled brain, when the early  shadows of the spring twilight were gathering in the room. She made up the fire  and swept the hearth, and arranged the tea-things on the comfortable round table,  and then sat down on a low stool by the fender to toast great rounds of bread which  would be as nothing in comparison to Richard&rsquo;s all-devouring capacity after a hard  day&rsquo;s work in the scene-room at the Ph&oelig;nix. How pleasant it was to perform all these  little familiar offices of love and duty. How sorrowfully she looked back to her  simple, free-and-easy life, now that she was to go amongst strangers who would exact  all manner of ceremonious observances from her. The Bohemianism of her existence  had been its greatest charm, and this poor benighted girl trembled at the prospect  of a life in which she would have to go through all those terrible performances  which she had read of, fearfully and wonderingly, in certain erudite essays upon  Etiquette, but which had never yet come within the range of her experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is my duty to go away from them,&rdquo; she kept saying to herself; &ldquo;it is my duty to  go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  had schooled herself in this difficult duty by the time her friends came home, and  she told them very quietly that she had seen Mrs. Bannister, and had agreed to accept  her patronage and services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  going to be a sort of companion or musical governess&mdash;I scarcely know which&mdash;to a  young lady at a country house called Hazlewood,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I am not  sorry to leave you, dear Signora, but Hortensia says it is better that I should  do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  don&rsquo;t think that I am not sorry to lose you, Nelly, when I tell you that I think  your sister is right,&rdquo; the Signora answered gently, as she kissed her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.</p>
<p>Perhaps  Eleanor was a little disappointed at this reply. She little dreamed how often Eliza  Picirillo had struggled against the selfishness of her affection, before she had  grown thus resigned to this parting.</p>
<p>Mr.  Richard Thornton groaned aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall  go out and pull down a couple of the Pilasters, and bury myself under them, &agrave; la  Sampson,&rdquo; he said piteously. &ldquo;What is to become of us without you, Eleanora? Who  will come over to the Ph&oelig;nix, and applaud my great scenes with the ferule of an  umbrella? Who&rsquo;ll cut up half-quartern loaves into toast when I am hungry, or have  Welsh rarebits in readiness on the hob, when I come home late at night? Who&rsquo;ll play  Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &lsquo;Songs without Words&rsquo; to me, and darn my stockings, and sew buttons&mdash;absurd  institutions, invented by ignorant people, who have never known the blessing of  pins&mdash;upon my shirts? Who&rsquo;ll abuse me when I go unshaven, or recommend blacking as  an embellishment for my boots? Who&rsquo;ll career in and out of the room with a dirty  white French poodle at her heels, looking like a fair-haired Esmeralda with a curly-coated  goat? What are we to do without you, Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was a sharp pain at poor Dick&rsquo;s heart as he apostrophised his adopted sister. Were  his feelings quite brotherly? was there no twinge of the fatal torture so common  to mankind mingled with this young man&rsquo;s feelings as he looked at the beautiful  face opposite to him, and remembered how soon it would have vanished from that shabby  chamber, leaving only dismal emptiness behind?</p>
<p>The  Signora looked at her nephew and sighed. Yes, it was far better that Eleanor should  go away. She could never have grown to love this honest-hearted, candid, slovenly  scene-painter, whose coat was a perfect landscape in distemper by reason of the  many coloured splashes which adorned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  poor Dick would have fallen in love with her, and would have broken his good, honest  heart,&rdquo; Eliza Picirillo said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad she&rsquo;s going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So from  the road which Destiny had appointed for her to tread, there was not one voice to  call Eleanor Vane aside. The affectionate and the indifferent alike conspired to  urge her onward. It was only her own inclination that would have held her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I could have stayed in London,&rdquo;  she thought, &ldquo;there might have been some chance of my meeting that man. All scamps  and villains come to hide themselves in London.  But in a quiet country village I shall be buried alive. When I pass the threshold  of Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s house, I bid good-bye to the hope of crossing that man&rsquo;s pathway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  letter came very quickly from Mrs. Bannister. Mrs. Darrell had accepted her dear  friend&rsquo;s recommendation, and was ready to receive Miss Vincent. It was under this  name the stockbroker&rsquo;s widow had introduced her half-sister to the notice of her  friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will receive a salary of thirty pounds a year,&rdquo; Hortensia Bannister wrote, &ldquo;and  your duties will be very light. Do not forget that your name at Hazlewood is to  be Vincent, and that you are carefully to avoid all reference to your father. You  will be amongst people who knew him well; and must, therefore, be on your guard.  I have described you as the orphan daughter of a gentleman who died in reduced circumstances,  and have thus strictly adhered to the truth. No questions will be asked of you,  as Mrs. Darrell is satisfied with my recommendation, and is too well bred to feel  any vulgar curiosity as to your past history. I send you, per parcel delivery, a  box of dresses and other wearing apparel, which will be of use to you. I also send  you five pounds for such little extra expenditure as may be necessary. Hazlewood  is thirty miles from London, and about seven from  Windsor. You will  go down by the Great Western, and stop at Slough,  where a conveyance will meet you; but I will write further upon this matter before  you go. Mrs. Darrell has kindly accorded you a fortnight&rsquo;s delay for such preparations  as you may require to make. You will be expected at Hazlewood on the 6th of April.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  only one other remark to make. I know that your father cherished a foolish notion  upon the subject of the Woodlands property. Pray bear in mind that no such idea  has ever been entertained by me. I know the Darrell family quite well enough to  feel assured that they will take care of their own rights, which I am content to  acknowledge, Remember, therefore, that I have no wish or expectation with regard  to Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s will; but it is, on the other hand, perfectly true, that  in his youth he did make a solemn promise that, in the event of his dying a bachelor,  he would leave that money to my father or his heirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane took very little notice of this final paragraph in her sister&rsquo;s letter. Who  cared for Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune? What was the good of it <i>now?</i> It  could not bring her father back to life; it could not blot out that quiet, unwitnessed  death-scene in the Parisian caf&eacute;; it could not rehabilitate the broken name, or  restore the shattered life. What could it matter who inherited the vile and useless  dross?</p>
<p>The  fortnight passed in a feverish unsatisfactory manner. Richard and the Signora took  care to conceal the poignancy of their regret at parting with the gay-hearted girl,  who had brought such new brightness into their narrow lives. Eleanor wept by stealth;  dropping many bitter tears over her work, as she remodelled Mrs. Bannister&rsquo;s silk  dresses, reducing those garments to the dimensions of her own girlish figure. The  last night came by-and-bye, the night of the 5th of April, the eve of a sorrowful  parting, and the beginning of a new existence.</p>
<p>It happened  to be a Sunday evening, and Eleanor and Richard walked out together in the quiet  Bloomsbury streets while the bells were ringing  for evening service, and the lamps glimmering dimly from the church windows. They  chose the loneliest streets in the old-fashioned middle-class quarter. Eleanor was  very pale, very silent. This evening walk had been her express desire, and Richard  watched her wonderingly. Her face had an expression which he remembered in the Rue  l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que, when he had told her the story of her father&rsquo;s death&mdash;an unnaturally  rigid look, strangely opposed to the changeful brightness common to that youthful  countenance.</p>
<p>They  had strolled slowly hither and thither in the deserted streets for some time. The  bells had ceased ringing, and the church-goers had all disappeared. The gray twilight  was stealing into the streets and squares, and the lights began to shine out from  the lower windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  quiet you are, Nelly,&rdquo; Richard said at last; &ldquo;why were you so anxious that we should  come out together alone, my dear? I fancied you had something particular to say  to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  something particular to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  about?&rdquo; asked Mr. Thornton.</p>
<p>He looked  thoughtfully at his companion. He could only see her profile&mdash;that clearly-defined,  almost classical outline&mdash;for she had not turned towards him when she spoke. Her  gray eyes looked straight before her into empty space, and her lips were tightly  compressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  love me, don&rsquo;t you, Richard?&rdquo; she asked presently, with a suddenness that startled  the scene-painter.</p>
<p>Poor  Dick blushed crimson at that alarming inquiry. How could she be so cruel as to ask  him such a question? For the last fortnight he had been fighting with himself&mdash;Heaven  knows how sturdily and honestly&mdash;in the heroic desire to put away this one fatal  thought from his mind; and now the girl for whose sake he had been doing battle  with his own selfishness, strikes the tenderest of all chords with her ignorant  hand, and wounds her victim to the very quick.</p>
<p>But  Miss Vane had no consciousness of the mischief she had done. Coquetry was an unknown  science to this girl of seventeen. In all matters connected with that womanly accomplishment  she was as much a child now that her seventeenth birthday was past, as she had been  in the old days at Chelsea  when she had upset Richard&rsquo;s colour-boxes and made grotesque copies of his paintings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  you love me, Dick,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;quite as much as if I were your real sister,  instead of a poor desolate girl who flung herself upon you and yours in the day  of her affliction. I know you love me, Dick, and would do almost anything for my  sake, and I wanted to speak to you to-night alone, because I am going to say something  that would distress the dear Signora, if she were to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is it, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  remember the story of my father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only  too well, Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you remember the vow I made when you told me that story, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do remember, Nelly,&rdquo; he said, after a pause; &ldquo;but I had hoped that you had forgotten  that foolish vow. For it was foolish, you know, my dear, as well as unwomanly,&rdquo;  the young man added gravely.</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  eyes flashed defiance upon her friend, as she turned to him for the first time that  evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;you thought that I had forgotten, because I was not always talking of  that man who caused my father&rsquo;s death. You thought my sorrow for my father was only  childish grief, that was to be forgotten when I turned my back upon the country  where he lies in his abandoned grave&mdash;his unconsecrated grave, poor dear! You thought  that nobody would ever try to avenge the poor, lonely old man&rsquo;s murder&mdash;for it was  a murder, Richard Thornton! What did the wretch who robbed him care for the anguish  of the heart he broke? What did he care what became of his victim? It was as base  and cruel a murder as was ever done upon this earth, Richard, though the world would  not call it by that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor,  my dear Eleanor! why do you talk of these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  girl&rsquo;s voice had risen with the vehemence of her passion, and Richard Thornton dreaded  the effect which this kind of conversation might have upon her excitable nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nelly,  my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would be better to forget all this. What good can you do  by cherishing these painful recollections? You are never likely to meet this man;  you do not even know his name. He was a scamp and an adventurer, no doubt; he may  be dead by this time. He may have done something to bring himself within the power  of the law, and he may be in prison, or transported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  may have done something to bring himself within the power of the law,&rdquo; repeated  Eleanor. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean  that he may have committed some crime for which he could be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could  he be punished by the law for having cheated my father at cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  sort of charge is always difficult to be proved, Nell; impossible to be proved after  the fact. No, I&rsquo;m afraid the law could never touch him for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  if he were to commit some other crime, he might be punished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I met him, Richard,&rdquo; cried Eleanor Vane, with a dangerous light kindling in her  eyes, &ldquo;I would try and lure him on to commit some crime, and then turn round upon  him and say, &lsquo;The law of the land could not avenge my father&rsquo;s death, but it can  punish you for a lesser crime. I have twisted the law to my own purpose, and made  it redress my father&rsquo;s wrongs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton stared aghast at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  Eleanor,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you talk like a Red Indian! This is quite shocking. You  frighten me, really; you do indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  sorry for that, Richard,&rdquo; Miss Vane answered meekly. She was a child in all things  which concerned her affections alone. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t grieve you or the dear Signora  for the world. But there are some things that are stronger than ourselves, Richard,  and the oath that I took a year and a-half ago in the Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que is one of  those things. I have never forgotten, Dick. Night after night&mdash;though I&rsquo;ve been happy  and light-hearted enough in the day, Richard dear, for I could not be otherwise  than happy with you and the Signora&mdash;night after night I have lain awake thinking  of my father&rsquo;s death. If that death had been a common one; if he had died in my  arms at the will of God instead of by the cruelty of a wretch, my grief might have  worn itself out by this time. But as it is, I cannot forget; I cannot forgive. If  all the Christian people in the world were to talk to me, I could never have one  merciful feeling towards this man. If he were going to be hung to-morrow, I should  be glad; and could walk barefoot to the place of his execution to see him suffer.  There is no treachery that I should think base if employed against him. There is  no slow torture I could inflict upon him that would seem cruel enough to satisfy  my hatred of him. Think what a helpless old man my father was; a broken-down gentleman;  the sort of man whom everybody pities, whom everybody respects. Remember this; and  then remember the cold-blooded deliberation of the wretch who cheated him out of  the money which was more than money to him&mdash;which represented honour&mdash;honesty&mdash;his  child&rsquo;s future&mdash;all he valued. Remember the remorseless cruelty of the wretch who  looked on while this helpless old man suffered a slow agony of six or seven hours&rsquo;  duration, and then left him alone in his misery and desolation. Think of this, Richard  Thornton, and don&rsquo;t wonder any longer if my feelings towards this man are not <i>Christian-like</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Eleanor, if I regret the vehemence of your feeling upon this subject, I do  not defend the man whose treachery hurried your father to his unhappy death; I only  wish to convince you of the folly you commit in cherishing these ideas of vengeance  and retribution. Life is not a three-volume novel or a five-act play, you know,  Nelly. The sudden meetings and strange coincidences common in novels are not very  general in our every-day existence. It is not at all likely that in the whole course  of your life you will ever again encounter this man. From the moment of your father&rsquo;s  death all clue to him was lost; for it was only your father who could have told  us who and what he was, or, at least, who and what he represented himself to be.  He is lost in the vast chaos of humanity now, my dear, and you have not the frailest  clue by which you might hope to find him. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, then, abandon all thought  of an impossible revenge. Have you forgotten the words we heard in the Epistle a  few weeks ago: &lsquo;Vengeance is mine,&rsquo; I will repay, saith the Lord. If the melo-dramatic  revenge of the stage is not practicable in real life, we know at least, my dear&mdash;for  you see we have it from very high authority&mdash;that wicked deeds do not go unpunished.  Far away at the remotest limits of the earth, this man, whom your puny efforts would  be powerless to injure, may suffer for his crime. Try and think of this, Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I  cannot</i>,&rdquo; answered the girl. &ldquo;The letter which my father wrote me before he died  was a direct charge which I will never disobey. The only inheritance I received  from him was that letter; that letter in which he told me to avenge his death. I  dare say you think me mad as well as wicked, Richard; but in spite of all you have  said, <i>I believe that I shall meet this man!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  scene-painter sighed and relapsed into despondent silence. How could he argue with  this girl? What could he do but love and admire her, and entrust himself to her  direction if she had need of a slave. While he was thinking this, Eleanor clasped  both her hands upon his arm and looked up earnestly in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard,  dear,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;I think you would serve me if you had the power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would  go through fire and water to do so, Nelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want  you to help me in this matter. You know as little of this man as I do, but you are  much cleverer than me. You mix with other people and see something of the world;  not much, I know, but still a great deal more than I do. I am going away into a  quiet country place, where there is no possible chance of meeting this man; you  will stay in London&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  I may brush against him in the streets any day, Nell, without being a shade the  wiser as to his identity. My dear child, for any practical purpose you will be as  near the man in Berkshire as I shall be in Bloomsbury.  Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of him any longer, Nelly. I can&rsquo;t tell you how this subject distresses  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t  leave off talking of him,&rdquo; said the young lady, resolutely, &ldquo;until you have made  me a promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  if ever you do come across any clue which may lead to the identification of the  man I want to find, you will follow it up, patiently and faithfully, sparing neither  trouble nor cost; for my sake, Richard, for my sake. Will you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,  my dear,&rdquo; Mr. Thornton answered. &ldquo;I do promise, and I will keep my promise honestly  if ever the chance of doing so should come to me. But I must tell you frankly, Nell,  I don&rsquo;t believe it ever will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless  you for the promise, notwithstanding, Richard,&rdquo; Eleanor said, warmly. &ldquo;It has made  me much happier. There will be two people henceforth, instead of one, set against  this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dark  frown over-shadowed her face. It seemed as if she had uttered those last few words  in the form of a threat and a defiance, which the man, whoever he was, and wherever  he was, might hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know all the strange things they say now about second sight, clairvoyance, odic  force, magnetic attraction&mdash;all sorts of long words whose meaning I don&rsquo;t understand,  Richard&mdash;I wonder sometimes if this man <i>knows</i> that I hate him, and that I  am watching for him, thinking of him, praying to meet him day and night. Perhaps  he does know this, and will hold himself on his guard against me, and try and avoid  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard  shrank from entering upon this subject; the conversation had been altogether disagreeable  to him. There was a horrible discrepancy between this girl&rsquo;s innocent youthful beauty  and all this determined talk of fierce and eager vengeance, which would have been  more natural to a Highland  or Corsican chieftain, than to a young lady of seventeen.</p>
<p>It was  dark now, and they went back to the Pilasters, where Eliza Picirillo was spending  that last night very sadly. The shabby room was only illumined by the glimmer of  a low fire, for the Signora had not cared to light the candles until her two children  came home. She had been sitting by the dingy window watching for their return, and  had fallen asleep in the darkness.</p>
<p>There  is no need to dwell upon that last night. It was like the eves of all partings,  very sad, very uncomfortable. Everything was disorganised by that approaching sorrow.  Conversation was desultory and forced, and Richard was glad to be employed in cording  Eleanor&rsquo;s boxes. She had two trunks now, and had a wardrobe that seemed to her magnificent,  so liberally had Mrs. Bannister bestowed her cast-off dresses upon her half-sister.</p>
<p>So the  last night passed away, the April morning came, and Eleanor&rsquo;s new life began.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  Gilbert Monckton</b></h2>
<p>Eleanor Vane was not to go down to Berkshire  alone. The beginning of her new life, that terrible beginning which she so much  dreaded, was to make her acquainted with new people.</p>
<p>She  had received the following communication from Mrs. Darrell.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Hazlewood, April 3rd, 1855.&#8288;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Madam,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;As  it would of course be very improper for a young lady of your age to travel alone,  I have provided against that contingency.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My  friend, Mr. Monckton, has kindly promised to meet you in the first-class waiting-room  at the Great Western Station, at three o&rsquo;clock on Monday afternoon. He will drive  you here on his way home.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I am,  Madam,&#8288;<br>
&ldquo;Yours faithfully,&#8288;<br>
&ldquo;Ellen Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eliza  Picirillo worked harder upon a Monday than on any other day in the week. She left  the Pilasters immediately after an early breakfast, to go upon a wearisome round  amongst her pupils. Richard was in the thick of the preparations for a new piece,  so poor Eleanor was obliged to go alone to the station, to meet the stranger who  had been appointed as her escort to Hazlewood.</p>
<p>She  quite broke down when the time came for bidding farewell to her old friend. She  clung about the Signora, weeping unrestrainedly for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  bear to go away from you,&rdquo; she sobbed piteously, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  my love,&rdquo; the music-mistress answered tenderly, &ldquo;if you really don&rsquo;t wish to go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no, it isn&rsquo;t that. I feel that I must go&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  I too, my dear girl. I believe you would do very wrong in refusing this situation.  But Nelly, my darling, remember that this is only an experiment. You may not be  happy at Hazlewood. In that case you will not fail to remember that your home is  always here; that come to it when you may, you will never fail to find a loving  welcome; and that the friends you leave behind you here are friends whom nothing  upon earth can ever estrange from you. Remember this, Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, dear, dear Signora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I could have gone with her to the station, I shouldn&rsquo;t have cared so much,&rdquo; Richard  murmured despondently, &ldquo;but the laws of Spavin and Cromshaw are as the laws of Draco.  If I don&rsquo;t get on with the Swiss ch&acirc;let and moonlit Alpine peaks, the new piece  can&rsquo;t come out on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So poor  Eleanor went to the station alone, and was overcharged by the cabman who carried  the two trunks which Richard had neatly addressed to Miss Vincent, Hazlewood, Berks.</p>
<p>She  was received by a civil porter, who took charge of her luggage while she went to  the waiting-room to look for the stranger who was to be her escort.</p>
<p>She  was no more a coquette than she had been nearly two years before, when she travelled  alone between London and Paris, and she was prepared to accept the services  of this stranger quite as frankly as she had accepted the care and protection of  the elderly gentleman who had taken charge of her upon that occasion.</p>
<p>But  how was she to recognise the stranger. She could not walk up to every gentleman  in the waiting-room, to ask him if he were Mr. Monckton.</p>
<p>She  had in almost all her wanderings travelled in second-class carriages, and waited  in second-class waiting-rooms. She shrank back, therefore, rather timidly upon the  threshold of the spacious carpeted saloon, and looked a little nervously at the  occupants of that gorgeous chamber. There was a group of ladies near the fire-place,  and two or three gentlemen in different parts of the room. One of these gentlemen  was a little man with gray hair and a red face; the other was very young and very  sandy; the third was a tall man of about forty, with close-cut black hair, and a  square massive face and head, not exactly a handsome face, perhaps, but a countenance  not easily to be overlooked.</p>
<p>This  tall man was standing near one of the windows, reading a newspaper. He looked up  as Eleanor pushed open the swinging door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder  which of them is Mr. Monckton,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Not that fidgetty young man with the  red hair, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While  she still stood doubtfully upon the threshold, hesitating what to do&mdash;she little  knew what a pretty picture she made in that timid, fluttering attitude&mdash;the tall  man threw down his newspaper upon the sofa beside him, and walked across the room  to where she stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Vincent, I believe?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Eleanor  blushed at the sound of that false name, and then bent her head in reply to the  question. She could not say yes. She could not fall into this disagreeable falsehood  all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s friend and legal adviser, Mr. Monckton,&rdquo; the gentleman said quietly,  &ldquo;and I shall be very happy to perform the duty she has entrusted to me. We are in  very good time, Miss Vincent. I know that young ladies are generally <i>ultra</i> punctual upon these occasions, and I came very early in order to anticipate you,  if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  did not speak. She was looking furtively at the face of Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s friend and  legal adviser. A good and wise adviser, Miss Vane thought: for the face, not strictly  handsome, seemed to bear in its every feature the stamp of three qualities&mdash;goodness,  wisdom, and strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  sure he is very good,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;but I would not like to offend him for the  world, for though he looks so kind now, I know he must be terrible when he&rsquo;s angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  looked almost fearfully at the strongly-marked black eyebrows, thinking what a stormy  darkness must overshadow the massive face when they contracted over the grave, brown  eyes&mdash;serious and earnest eyes, but with a latent fire lurking somewhere in their  calm depths, Eleanor thought.</p>
<p>The  girl&rsquo;s mind rambled on thus while she stood by the stranger&rsquo;s side in the sunlit  window. Already the blankness of her new life was broken by this prominent figure  standing boldly out upon its very threshold. Already she was learning to be interested  in new people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  isn&rsquo;t a bit like a lawyer,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I fancied lawyers were always shabby old  men, with blue bags. The men who used to come to Chelsea after papa were always nasty disagreeable  men, with papers about the Queen and Richard Roe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton looked thoughtfully down at the girl by his side. There was a vein of silent  poetry, and there were dim glimpses of artistic feeling hidden somewhere in the  nature of this man, very far below the hard, business-like exterior which he presented  to the world. He felt a quiet pleasure in looking at Eleanor&rsquo;s young beauty. It  was her youthfulness, perhaps, her almost childlike innocence, which made her greatest  charm. Her face was not that of a common beauty: her aquiline nose, gray eyes, and  firmly-moulded mouth had a certain air of queenliness very rarely to be seen; but  the youth of the soul shining out of the clear eyes was visible in every glance,  in every change of expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you know much of Berkshire, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; the  lawyer asked, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I have never been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are very young, and I daresay have never left home before?&rdquo; Mr. Monckton said. He  was wondering that no relative or friend had accompanied the girl to the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  been at school,&rdquo; Eleanor answered; &ldquo;but I have never been away from home before&mdash;to&mdash;to  get my own living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought  not. Your papa and mamma must be very sorry to lose you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  neither father nor mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;  said Mr. Monckton; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  after a pause he said, in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  the young lady you are going to will like you all the better for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  Eleanor asked involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  she has never known either father or mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor  girl!&rdquo; murmured Eleanor, &ldquo;they are both dead, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer did not answer this question. He was so far professional, even in his conversation  with Miss Vane, that he asked a great many more questions than he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you like going to Hazlewood, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; he said, by-and-bye, rather abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I am leaving very dear friends to go to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers,  who may illtreat you, eh?&rdquo; muttered Mr. Monckton. &ldquo;You need have no apprehension  of that sort of thing, I assure you, Miss Vincent. Mrs. Darrell is rather rigid  in her ideas of life; she has had her disappointments, poor soul, and you must be  patient with her: but Laura Mason, the young lady who is to be your companion, is  the gentlest and most affectionate girl in Christendom, I should think. She is a  sort of ward of mine, and her future life is in my hands; a very heavy responsibility,  Miss Vincent; she will have plenty of money by-and-bye&mdash;houses, and horses, and carriages,  and servants, and all the outer paraphernalia of happiness: but Heaven knows if  she will be happy, poor girl. She has never known either mother or father. She has  lived with all manner of respectable matrons, who have promised to do a mother&rsquo;s  duty to her, and have tried to do it, I daresay; but she has never had a mother,  Miss Vincent. I am always sorry for her when I think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer sighed heavily, and his thoughts seemed to wander away from the young lady  in his charge. He still stood at the window, looking out at the bustle on the platform,  but not seeing it, I think, and took no further notice of Eleanor until the bell  rang for the starting of the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he said, rousing himself suddenly from his reverie; &ldquo;I have forgotten  all about your ticket. I&rsquo;ll put you into a carriage, and then send a porter for  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton scarcely spoke to his companion half a dozen times during the brief journey  to Slough. He sat with a newspaper before him,  but Eleanor noticed that he never turned its leaves, and once, when she caught a  glimpse of the lawyer&rsquo;s face, she saw that it wore the same gloomy and abstracted  expression that she had observed upon it as Mr. Monckton stood in the window of  the waiting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  must be very fond of his ward,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;or he could never be so sorry because  she has no mother. I thought lawyers were hard, cruel men, who cared for nothing  in the world. I always used to fancy my sister Hortensia ought to have been a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By-and-bye,  as they drew very near to the station, Mr. Monckton dropped his newspaper with another  sigh, and turning to Eleanor, said, in a low, confidential voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope  you will be very good to Laura Mason, Miss Vincent. Remember that she stands quite  alone in the world; and that however friendless, however desolate you may be&mdash;I say  this because you tell me you are an orphan&mdash;you can never be so friendless or so  desolate as she is.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Hazlewood</b></h2>
<p>A phaeton and pair was in waiting for Mr. Monckton outside the Slough station. The vehicle was very plain, but had a certain  quiet elegance of its own, and the horses had been sold at Tattersall&rsquo;s for something  over five hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane&rsquo;s spirits rose in spite of herself as she sat by the lawyer&rsquo;s side, driving  at a rapid rate through the pretty pastoral country. They crossed the river almost  immediately after leaving Slough, and dashed into Berkshire.  They skirted Windsor Park and Forest, leaving  the black outline of the castle keep looming in the dim distance behind them; and  then turned into a quiet country road, where the green banks were dotted by clumps  of early primroses, and the white-thorns were bursting into flower.</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked rapturously at all this rural beauty. She was a Cockney, poor child, and  her experience of the country was confined to rambles in Greenwich Park,  or on Richmond Terrace; happy rambles with her father, prior to expensive dinners  at the Crown and Sceptre, or the Star and Garter, as the case might be.</p>
<p>But  the country, the genuine country, the long roads and patches of common, the glimpses  of wood and water, the great deserts of arable land, the scattered farm-houses,  and noisy farm-yards; all these were strange and new to her, and her soul expanded  in the unfamiliar atmosphere.</p>
<p>If that  drive could have lasted for ever, it would have been very delightful; but she knew  that those splendid chestnut horses were carrying her at a terrible rate to her  new home. Her new home! What right had she to call Hazlewood by that name? She was  not going home. She was going to her first situation.</p>
<p>All  the pride of birth, the foolish and mistaken pride in shipwrecked fortune and squandered  wealth which this girl&rsquo;s weak-minded father had instilled into her, arose and rebelled  against this bitter thought. What humiliation Mrs. Bannister&rsquo;s cruelty had inflicted  upon her!</p>
<p>She  was thinking this when Mr. Monckton suddenly turned his horses&rsquo; heads away from  the main road, and the phaeton entered a lane above which the branches of the still  leafless trees made an overarching roof of delicate tracery.</p>
<p>At the  end of this lane, in which the primroses seemed to grow thicker than in any other  part of the country, there were some low wooden gates, and an old-fashioned iron  lamp-post. On the other side of the gates there was a wide lawn shut in by a shrubbery  and a grove of trees, and beyond the lawn glimmered the sunlit windows of a low  white house; a rambling cottage, whose walls were half-hidden by trellis-work and  ivy, and not one of whose windows or chimneys owned a fellowship with the others.</p>
<p>Pigeons  were cooing and hens clucking somewhere behind the house, a horse began to neigh  as the carriage stopped, and three dogs, one very big, and two very little ones,  ran out upon the lawn, and barked furiously at the phaeton.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane could not help thinking the low-roofed, white-walled, ivy-covered irregular  cottage very pretty, even though it <i>was</i> Hazlewood.</p>
<p>While  the dogs were barking their loudest, a delicate little figure, fluttering in white  and blue, came floating out of a window under the shadow of a verandah, and ran  towards the gates.</p>
<p>It was  the figure of a young lady, very fragile-looking and graceful. A young lady, whose  complexion was fairer than a snow-drop, and whose loose floating hair was of the  palest shade of flaxen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be  quiet, Julius C&aelig;sar; be quiet, Mark Antony,&rdquo; she cried, to the dogs, who ran up  to her and leaped and whirled about her, jumping almost higher than her head in  an excess of canine spirits. &ldquo;Be quiet, you big, wicked Julius C&aelig;sar, or you shall  go back to the stables, sir. Is this the way you behave yourself when I&rsquo;ve had ever  so much trouble to get you a half-holiday? Please, don&rsquo;t mind them, Miss Vincent,&rdquo;  the young lady added, opening the gate, and looking up pleadingly at Eleanor; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re  only noisy. They wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you for the world; and they&rsquo;ll love you very much  by-and-by, when they come to know you. I&rsquo;ve been watching for you such a time, Mr.  Monckton. The train must have been very slow this afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  train travelled at its usual speed, neither slower nor faster,&rdquo; the lawyer said,  with a quiet smile, as he handed Eleanor out of the phaeton. He left the horses  in the care of the groom, and walked on to the lawn with the two girls. The dogs  left off barking at a word from him, though they had made very light of Miss Mason&rsquo;s  entreaties. They seemed to know him, and to be accustomed to obey him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  the afternoon <i>seemed</i> dreadfully long,&rdquo; the young lady said.&rdquo; I thought the  train <i>must</i> be behind its time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,  of course, you never thought of looking at your watch, Miss Mason,&rdquo; the lawyer said,  pointing to a quantity of jewelled toys which hung at the young lady&rsquo;s blue sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the good of looking at one&rsquo;s watch, if one&rsquo;s watch won&rsquo;t go?&rdquo; said Miss Mason; &ldquo;the  sun has been going down ever so long, but the sun&rsquo;s so changeable, there&rsquo;s no relying  on it. Mrs. Darrell has gone out in the pony-carriage to call upon some people near  Woodlands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane started at the sudden mention of a name which had been so familiar to her from  her dead father&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  I am all alone,&rdquo; continued Miss Mason, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m very glad of that, because we shall  get to know each other so much better by ourselves; shan&rsquo;t we, Miss Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George  Monckton had been walking between the two girls, but Laura Mason came round to Eleanor,  and put her hand in that of Miss Vane. It was a fat little childish hand, but there  were rings glittering upon it, small as it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  I shall like you very much,&rdquo; Laura Mason whispered. &ldquo;Do you think you shall like  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  looked up into Eleanor&rsquo;s face, with an entreating expression in her blue eyes; they  were really blue eyes, a bright forget-me-not, or turquoise blue, as different as  possible to the clear gray of Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes, which was for ever changing, sometimes  purple, sometimes brown, sometimes black.</p>
<p>How  could Miss Vane reply to this childish question, except in the affirmative? She  had every inclination to love the babyish young lady, who was so ready to cling  to her and confide in her. She had expected to find a haughty young heiress who  would have flaunted her wealth before her penniless companion. But she had another  reason for inclining tenderly towards this girl. She remembered what Mr. Monckton  had said to her in the railway carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However  friendless or desolate you may be, you can never be so friendless and desolate as  she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  pressed the hand that clung to hers, and said, gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I shall love you, Miss Mason, if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you&rsquo;ll not be dreadful about triplets, and arpeggios, and cinquepaced passages,&rdquo;  the young lady said, piteously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind music a bit, in a general way, you  know; but I never could play triplets in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  led the way into a sitting-room under the verandah, as she talked. Eleanor went  with her, hand-in-hand, and Mr. Monckton followed, keeping an attentive watch upon  the two girls.</p>
<p>The  sitting-room was, like the exterior of the cottage, very irregular and very pretty.  It stood at one end of the house, and there were windows upon three sides of the  room,&mdash;an oriel at the end opposite the door, a bay opening on to the verandah, and  three latticed windows with deep oaken seats upon the other side.</p>
<p>The  furniture was pretty, but very simple and inexpensive. The chintz curtains and chair-covers  were sprinkled with rose-buds and butterflies; the chairs and tables were of shining  maple-wood, and there was a good supply of old china arranged here and there upon  brackets and cabinets of obsolete form. The pale cream-coloured walls were hung  with a few prints and water-coloured sketches; but beyond this the chamber had no  adornments.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason led Eleanor to one of the window-seats, where a litter of fancy-work, and  two or three open books tumbled carelessly here and there amongst floss-silks and  Berlin wools and  scraps of embroidery, gave token of the young lady&rsquo;s habits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you take off your things here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or shall I show you your own room at  once? It&rsquo;s the blue room, next to mine. There&rsquo;s a door between the two rooms, so  we shall be able to talk to each other whenever we like. How dreadfully you must  want something to eat after your journey! Shall I ring for cake and wine, or shall  we wait for tea? We always drink tea at seven, and we dine very early; not like  Mr. Monckton, who has a grand late dinner every evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather  a desolate dinner, sometimes, Miss Mason,&rdquo; he said, gravely; &ldquo;but you remind me  that I shall be hardly in time for it, and my poor housekeeper makes herself wretched  when the fish is spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked  at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six  o&rsquo;clock, I declare; good-bye, Laura; good-bye, Miss Vincent. I hope you will be  happy at Hazlewood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>sure</i> I shall be happy with Miss Mason,&rdquo; Eleanor answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;  exclaimed Mr. Monckton, elevating his straight black eyebrows, &ldquo;is she so very fascinating,  then? I&rsquo;m sorry for it,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath as he walked away after shaking  hands with the two girls.</p>
<p>They  heard the phaeton driving away three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason shrugged her shoulders with an air of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you like him very much. He&rsquo;s very good, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, very, very good, and I do like him. But I&rsquo;m afraid of him, I think, because  he&rsquo;s so good. He always seems to be watching one and finding out one&rsquo;s faults. And  he seems so sorry because I&rsquo;m frivolous, and I can&rsquo;t help being frivolous when I&rsquo;m  happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  are you always happy?&rdquo; Eleanor asked. She thought it very possible that this young  heiress, who had never known any of those bitter troubles which Miss Vane had found  associated with &ldquo;money matters,&rdquo; might indeed be <i>always</i> happy. But Laura  Mason shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always,  except when I think,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but when I think about papa and mamma, and wonder  who they were, and why I never knew them, I can&rsquo;t help feeling very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  died when you were very young, then?&rdquo; Eleanor said.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason shook her head with a sorrowful gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely  know when they died,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I know that I can remember nothing about them;  the first thing I recollect is being with a lady, far down in Devonshire&mdash;a  lady who took the charge of several little girls. I stayed with her till I was ten  years old, and then I was sent to a fashionable school at Bayswater, and I stayed  there till I was fifteen, and then I came here, and I&rsquo;ve been here two years and  a-half. Mr. Monckton is my guardian, you know, and he says I am a very lucky girl,  and will have plenty of money by-and-by; but what&rsquo;s the use of money if one has  no relations in all the wide world? and he tells me to attend to my education, and  not to be frivolous, or care for dress and jewellery, but to try and become a good  woman. He talks to me very seriously, and almost frightens me sometimes with his  grave manner; but, for all that, he&rsquo;s very kind, and lets me have almost everything  I ask him for. He&rsquo;s tremendously rich himself, you know, though he is only a professional  man, and he lives at a beautiful place four miles from here, called Tolldale Priory.  I used to ask him questions about papa and mamma, but he would never tell me anything.  So now I never speak to him about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  sighed as she finished speaking, and was silent for some few minutes; but she very  quickly recovered her spirits and conducted Eleanor to a pretty rustic chamber with  a lattice window looking on to the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Darrell&rsquo;s man is gone to fetch your luggage,&rdquo; Miss Mason said, &ldquo;so you must have  my brushes and combs, please, for your hair, and then we&rsquo;ll go down to tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  led Eleanor into the adjoining apartment, where the dressing-table was littered  with all manner of womanly frivolities, and here Miss Vane re-arranged her luxuriant  golden brown hair, which no longer was allowed to fall about her shoulders in rippling  curls, but was drawn simply away from her forehead, and rolled in a knot at the  back of her head. She was a woman now, and had begun the battle of life.</p>
<p>A pony-carriage  drove up to the gate while Eleanor was standing at the glass by the open window,  and Mrs. Darrell got out and walked across the lawn towards the house.</p>
<p>She  was a tall woman, unusually tall for a woman, and she was dressed in black silk,  which hung about her angular limbs in heavy, lustreless folds. Eleanor could see  that her face was pale, and her eyes black and flashing.</p>
<p>The  two girls went down stairs hand-in-hand. Tea was prepared in the dining-room, a  long wainscoted apartment older than the rest of the house, and rather gloomy-looking.  Three narrow windows upon one side of this room looked towards the shrubbery and  grove at the back of the house, and the trunks of the trees looked gaunt and black  in the spring twilight. A fire was burning upon the low hearth, and a maid-servant  was lighting a lamp in the centre of the table as the two girls went in.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell welcomed her dependant very politely; but there was a harshness and a stiffness  in her politeness which reminded Eleanor of her half-sister, Mrs. Bannister. The  two women seemed to belong to the same school, Miss Vane thought.</p>
<p>The  lamplight shone full upon Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s face, and Eleanor could see now that the  face was a handsome one, though faded and careworn. The widow&rsquo;s hair was gray, but  her eyes retained the flashing brightness of youth. They were very dark and lustrous,  but their expression was scarcely pleasant. There was too much of the hawk or eagle  in their penetrating glance.</p>
<p>But  Laura Mason did not seem at all afraid of her protectress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Vincent and I are good friends already, Mrs. Darrell,&rdquo; she said, gaily, &ldquo;and we  shall be as happy together as the day is long, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  I hope Miss Vincent will teach you industrious habits, Laura,&rdquo; Mrs. Darrell answered,  gravely.</p>
<p>Miss  Mason made a grimace with her pretty red under lip.</p>
<p>Eleanor  took the seat indicated to her, a seat at the end of the dining-table, and exactly  opposite to Mrs. Darrell, who sat with her back to the fire-place.</p>
<p>Sitting  here, Eleanor could scarcely fail to observe an oil painting&mdash;the only picture in  the room&mdash;which hung over the mantelpiece. It was the portrait of a young man, with  dark hair clustering about a handsome forehead, regular features, a pale complexion,  and black eyes. The face was very handsome, very aristocratic, but there was a want  of youthfulness, of the fresh, eager spirit of boyhood, in its expression. A look  of listlessness and hauteur hung like a cloud over the almost faultless features.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell watched Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes as the girl looked at this picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are looking at my son, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but perhaps it is scarcely necessary  to tell you so. People say there is a strong likeness between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was indeed a very striking resemblance between the faded face below and the pictured  face above. But it seemed to Eleanor Vane as if the mother&rsquo;s face, faded and careworn  though it was, was almost the younger of the two. The listless indifference, the  utter lack of energy in the lad&rsquo;s countenance, was so much the more striking when  contrasted with the youthfulness of the features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  exclaimed Laura Mason, &ldquo;that is Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s only son, Launcelot Darrell. Isn&rsquo;t  that a romantic name, Miss Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  started. This Launcelot Darrell was the heir presumptive to the De Crespigny estate.  How often she had heard the young man&rsquo;s name! It was he, then, who would have stood  between her father and fortune, had that dear father lived, or whose claim of kindred  would, perhaps, have had to make way for the more sacred right of friendship.</p>
<p>And  this young man&rsquo;s portrait was hanging in the room where she sat. He lived in the  house, perhaps. Where should he live except in his mother&rsquo;s house?</p>
<p>But  Eleanor&rsquo;s mind was soon relieved upon this point, for Laura Mason, in the pauses  of the business of the tea-table, talked a good deal about the original of the portrait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think him handsome, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; she asked, without waiting for an answer.  &ldquo;But of course you do; everybody thinks him handsome; and then Mrs. Darrell says  he&rsquo;s so elegant, so tall, so aristocratic. He is to have Woodlands by-and-by, and  all Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s money. But of course you don&rsquo;t know Woodlands or Mr. de Crespigny.  How should you, when you&rsquo;ve never been in Berkshire  before? And he&mdash;not Mr. Crespigny, he&rsquo;s a nasty, fidgety, hypochon&mdash;what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s name&mdash;old  man?&mdash;but Launcelot Darrell is so accomplished. He&rsquo;s an artist, you know, and all  the water-coloured sketches in the drawing-room and the breakfast-parlour are his;  and he plays and sings, and he dances exquisitely, and he rides and plays cricket,  and he&rsquo;s a&mdash;what you may call it&mdash;a crack shot; and, in short, he&rsquo;s an Admirable Crichton.  You musn&rsquo;t fancy I&rsquo;m in love with him, you know, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; the young lady added,  blushing and laughing, &ldquo;because I never saw him in my life, and I only know all  this by hearsay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  never saw him!&rdquo; repeated Eleanor.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell did not live at Hazlewood, then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  the widow interposed; &ldquo;my son has enemies, I am sorry to say, amongst his own kindred.  Instead of occupying the position his talents, to say nothing of his birth, entitle  him to, he has been compelled to go out to India in a mercantile capacity. I do  not wonder that his spirit rebels against such an injustice. I do not wonder that  he cannot forgive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell&rsquo;s face darkened as she spoke, and she sighed heavily. By-and-by, when the  two girls were alone together in the breakfast-room, Laura Mason alluded to the  conversation at the tea-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think I ought to have talked about Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I know his mother  is unhappy about him, though I don&rsquo;t exactly know why. You see his two aunts who  live at Woodlands are nasty, scheming old-maids, and they contrived to keep him  away from his great-uncle, Mr. de Crespigny, who is expected to leave him all his  money. Indeed, I don&rsquo;t see who else he can leave it to now. There was an old man&mdash;a  college friend of Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s&mdash;who expected to get the Woodlands estate; but  of course that was an absurd idea; and the old man&mdash;the father of that very Mrs.  Bannister who recommended you to Mrs. Darrell, by-the-bye&mdash;is dead. So all chance  of that sort of thing is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Launcelot Darrell is sure to have the fortune?&rdquo; Eleanor said, interrogatively,  after a very long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  if Mr. de Crespigny dies without a will. But those two cantankerous old-maids, Mrs.  Darrell&rsquo;s sisters, are at him night and day, and they may persuade him at last,  or they may have succeeded in persuading him, perhaps, ever so long ago, to make  a will in their favour. Of course all this makes Mrs. Darrell very unhappy. She  idolises her son, who is an only child, and was terribly spoiled when he was a boy,  they say; and she does not know whether he will be a rich man or a pauper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,  in the meantime, Mr. Darrell is in India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  He went to India  three years ago. He&rsquo;s overseer to an indigo-planter up the country, at some place  with an unpronounceable name, hundreds and hundreds of miles from Calcutta. He&rsquo;s not at all happy,  I believe, and he very seldom writes&mdash;not above once in a twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is not a good son, then,&rdquo; Eleanor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know about that! Mrs. Darrell never complains, and she&rsquo;s very proud of him.  She always speaks of him as &lsquo;my son.&rsquo; But, of course, what with one thing and another,  she is often very unhappy. So, if she is a little severe, now and then, we&rsquo;ll try  and bear with her, won&rsquo;t we, Eleanor? I may call you Eleanor, mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  pretty flaxen head dropped upon Miss Vane&rsquo;s shoulder, as the heiress asked this  question, and the blue eyes were lifted pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; I would much rather be called Eleanor than Miss Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you&rsquo;ll call me Laura. Nobody ever calls me Miss Mason except Mr. Monckton when he  lectures me. We shall be very, very happy together, I hope, Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope  so, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was a sudden pang of mingled fear and remorse at Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s heart as she said  this. Was she to be happy, and to forget the purpose of her life? Was she to be  happy, and false to the memory of her murdered father? In this quiet country life;  in this pleasant girlish companionship which was so new to her, was she to abandon  that one dark dream, that one deeply-rooted desire which had been in her mind ever  since her father&rsquo;s untimely death?</p>
<p>She  recoiled with a shudder of dread from the simple happiness which threatened to lull  her to a Sybarite rest, in which that deadly design might lose its force and, little  by little, fade out of her mind.</p>
<p>She  disengaged herself from the slight arms which had encircled her in a half-childish  caress, and rose suddenly to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura,&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;Laura, you mustn&rsquo;t talk to me like this. My life is not like yours.  I have something to do,&mdash;I have a purpose to achieve; a purpose before which every  thought of my mind, every impulse of my heart, must give way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  purpose, Eleanor?&rdquo; asked Laura Mason, almost alarmed by the energy of her companion&rsquo;s  manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot  tell you. It is a secret,&rdquo; Miss Vane replied.</p>
<p>Then  sitting down once more in the deep window-seat by Laura&rsquo;s side, Eleanor Vane drew  her arm tenderly round the frightened girl&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try and do my duty to you, Laura, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I know I shall be happy  with you. But if ever you see me dull and silent, you&rsquo;ll understand, dear, that  there is a secret in my life, and that there is a hidden purpose in my mind that  sooner or later must be achieved. Sooner or later,&rdquo; she repeated, with a sigh, &ldquo;but  Heaven only knows when.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  was silent and absent-minded during the rest of the evening, though she played one  of her most elaborate fantasias at Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s request, and perfectly satisfied  that lady&rsquo;s expectations by the brilliancy of her touch. She was very glad when,  at ten o&rsquo;clock, the two women servants of the simple household and a hobadahoyish  young man, who looked after the pony and pigs and poultry-yard, and smelt very strongly  of the stable, came in to hear prayers read by Mrs. Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  you&rsquo;re tired, dear,&rdquo; Laura Mason said, as she bade Eleanor good night at the door  of her bed-room, &ldquo;so I won&rsquo;t ask you to talk to me to-night. Get to bed, and go  to sleep at once, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Eleanor did not go to bed immediately; nor did she fall asleep until very late that  night.</p>
<p>She  unfastened one of her trunks, and took from it a little locked morocco casket, which  held a few valueless and old-fashioned trinkets that had been her mother&rsquo;s, and  the crumpled fragment of her father&rsquo;s last letter.</p>
<p>She  sat at the little dressing-table, reading the disjointed sentences in that melancholy  letter, before she undressed, and then replaced the scrap of paper in the casket.</p>
<p>She  looked at the lawn and shrubbery. The shining leaves of the evergreens trembled  in the soft April breeze, and shimmered in the moonlight. All was silent in that  simple rustic retreat. The bare branches of the tall trees near the low white gates  were sharply defined against the purple sky. High up in the tranquil heavens the  full moon shone out from a pale back-ground of fleecy cloud.</p>
<p>The  beauty of the scene made a very powerful impression upon Eleanor Vane. The window  from which she had been accustomed to look in Bloomsbury abutted on a yard, a narrow  gorge of dirt and disorder, between the dismal back walls of high London houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought  never to have come here,&rdquo; Eleanor thought bitterly, as she let fall her dimity window  curtain and shut out the splendour of the night. &ldquo;I ought to have stayed in London; there was some hope of my meeting that man in London, where strange things  are always happening. But here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  fell into a gloomy reverie. Secluded in that quiet rustic retreat, what hope could  she have of advancing, by so much as one footstep, upon the dark road she had appointed  for herself to tread?</p>
<p>It was  very long before she fell asleep. She lay for hours, tumbling and tossing feverishly  upon her comfortable bed.</p>
<p>The  memories of her old life mingled themselves with thoughts of her new existence.  She was haunted now by the recollection of her father, and her father&rsquo;s death; now  by her fresh experiences of Hazlewood, by the widow&rsquo;s grey hair and penetrating  gaze, and by the pictured face of Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  The Prodigal&rsquo;s Return</b></h2>
<p>The course of Eleanor&rsquo;s life at Hazlewood was peaceful and  monotonous. She had been engaged simply as a &ldquo;companion&rdquo; for Laura Mason. That common  epithet which is so often twisted into the signification of a household drudge&mdash;an  upper-servant, who works harder than any of her fellows&mdash;in this case meant purely  and simply what it was originally intended to mean. Eleanor&rsquo;s only duties were to  teach Laura Mason music, and to be the companion and associate of all her girlish  pleasures and industries.</p>
<p>Not  that Miss Mason was very industrious. She had a habit of beginning great undertakings  in the way of fancy work, and the more gigantic the design the more ardent was her  desire to attempt it&mdash;but she rarely got beyond the initiative part of her labour.  There was always some &ldquo;Dweller on the Threshold&rdquo; in the shape of a stitch that couldn&rsquo;t  be learnt, or a skein of silk that couldn&rsquo;t be matched, or a pattern that <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> come right; and one after another of the gigantic undertakings was flung aside to  decay in dusty oblivion, or to be finished by Eleanor or Mrs. Darrell.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason was not made for the active service of life. She was one of the holiday soldiers  in the great army, fit for nothing but to wear gilded epaulettes and gorgeous uniforms,  and to turn out upon gala days to the sound of trumpet and drum.</p>
<p>She  was a loving, generous-hearted, confiding creature; but, like some rudderless boat  drifting hither and thither before a stormy ocean, this frivolous, purposeless girl  flung herself, helpless and dependent, upon the mercy of other people.</p>
<p>The  rich City solicitor, Mr. Monckton, the head of a celebrated legal firm familiar  in the Bankruptcy Court, took the trouble to say very little about his pretty, flaxen-haired,  and blue-eyed ward.</p>
<p>He spoke  of her, indeed, with an almost pointed indifference. She was the daughter of some  people he had known in his early youth, he said, and her fortune had been entrusted  to his care. She would be rich, but he was none the less anxious about her future.  A woman was not generally any the safer in this world for being an heiress.</p>
<p>This  was all Gilbert Monckton had ever said to Mrs. Darrell upon the subject of his ward&rsquo;s  past history. Laura herself had talked freely enough of her two first homes. There  was little to tell, but, upon the other hand, there seemed nothing to conceal.</p>
<p>Upon  one subject Mr. Monckton was very strict, and that was the seclusion of the home  he had chosen for his ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  Miss Mason is of age she will of course choose for herself,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but until  that time comes I must beg, Mrs. Darrell, that you will keep her out of all society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under  these circumstances it was especially necessary that Laura Mason should have a companion  of her own age. Hazlewood was a hermitage, never approached by any visitors except  some half-dozen elderly ladies, who were intimate with Mrs. Darrell, and Mr. Monckton,  who came about once a fortnight to dine and spend the evening.</p>
<p>He used  to devote himself very much to Laura and her companion during these visits. Eleanor  could see how earnestly he watched the flaxen-haired girl, whose childish simplicity  no doubt made her very bewitching to the grave man of business. He watched her and  listened to her; sometimes with a pleased smile, sometimes with an earnest and anxious  face; but his attention very rarely wandered from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  must love her very dearly,&rdquo; Eleanor thought, remembering how earnestly he had spoken  in the railway carriage.</p>
<p>She  wondered what was the nature of the affection which the solicitor felt for his ward.  He was old enough to be her father, it was true, but he was still in the prime of  life; he had not that beauty of feature and complexion which a school-girl calls  handsome, but he had a face which leaves its impress upon the minds of those who  look at it.</p>
<p>He was  very clever, or at least he seemed so to Eleanor; for there was no subject ever  mentioned, no topic ever discussed, with which he did not appear thoroughly familiar,  and upon which his opinions were not original and forcible. Eleanor&rsquo;s intellect  expanded under the influence of this superior masculine intelligence. Her plastic  mind, so ready to take any impression, was newly moulded by its contact with this  stronger brain. Her education, very imperfect before, seemed to complete itself  now by the force of association with a clever man.</p>
<p>Of course  all this came about by slow degrees. She did not very rapidly become familiar with  Gilbert Monckton, for his grave manner was rather calculated to inspire diffidence  in a very young woman; but little by little, as she grew accustomed to his society,  accustomed to sit quietly in the shade, only speaking now and then, while Laura  Mason talked familiarly to her guardian, she began to discover how much she had  gained from her association with the lawyer. It was not without some bitterness  of spirit that Eleanor Vane thought of this. She felt as if she had been an interloper  in that quiet Hazlewood household. What right had she to come between Laura and  her guardian, and steal the advantages Mr. Monckton intended for his ward? It was  for Laura&rsquo;s sake he had been earnest or eloquent; it was for Laura&rsquo;s benefit he  had described this, or explained that. What right, then, had she, Eleanor, to remember  what Laura had forgotten, or to avail herself of the advantages Laura was too frivolous  to value?</p>
<p>There  was a gulf between the two girls that could not be passed, even by affection. Eleanor  Vane&rsquo;s mental superiority placed her so high above Laura Mason that perfect confidence  could not exist between them. Eleanor&rsquo;s love for the light-hearted, heedless girl  had something almost motherly in its nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  we shall never quite understand each other, Laura,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I think I could  give up my life for your sake, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or  I for you, Nelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no, Laura. I know you are unselfish as an angel, and you&rsquo;d wish to do so; but yours  is not the giving-up nature, my darling. You&rsquo;d die under a great sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  I should, Nelly,&rdquo; the girl answered, drawing closer to her friend, and trembling  at the very thought of calamity; &ldquo;but how you speak, dear. Had you ever a great  sorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  a very great one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  yet you are happy with us, and can sing and play, and ramble about in the woods  with me, Nell, as if you had nothing on your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Laura, but I can remember my sorrow all the time. It&rsquo;s hidden so deep in my heart  that the sunshine never reaches it, however happy I may seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura  Mason sighed. The spoiled child of fortune could not help wondering how she would  act under the influence of a great misery. She would sit down upon the ground in  some darkened room, she thought, and cry until her heart broke and she died.</p>
<p>The  summer faded into autumn, and autumn into winter, and the early spring flowers bloomed  again in the shrubberies and on the lawn at Hazlewood. The primroses were pale upon  the tender grass of the sloping banks in the wooded lane near the gates, and still  no event had happened to break the tranquil monotony of that secluded household.  Eleanor had grown familiar with every nook in the rambling old cottage; even with  Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s apartments, a suite of rooms on the bed-room floor, looking  out into the grove at the back of the house. These rooms had been shut up for years,  ever since Launcelot had sailed for India, and they had a gloomy, desolate  look, though fires were lighted in them periodically, and every scrap of furniture  was kept carefully dusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  rooms must always be ready,&rdquo; Mrs. Darrell said. &ldquo;Mr. de Crespigny may die without  having made a will, and my son may be called home suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the  three rooms, a bed-room, dressing-room, and sitting-room, were kept in perfect order,  and Laura and Eleanor wandered into them sometimes, in the idleness of a wet afternoon,  and looked at the pictures upon the walls, the unfinished sketches piled one upon  the top of another on the easel, or tried the little cottage piano, upon which Mr.  Darrell had been wont to accompany himself when he sang. His mother always insisted  upon this piano being tuned when the tuner came from Windsor to attend to Laura Mason&rsquo;s modern grand.  The two girls used to talk a good deal of the widow&rsquo;s handsome son. They had heard  him spoken of by his mother, by the servants, and by the few humble neighbours in  scattered cottages near Hazlewood. They talked of his uncertain fortunes, his accomplishments,  his handsome, haughty face, which Laura declared was faultless. Miss Vane had been  a twelvemonth at Hazlewood. Her eighteenth birthday was past, and the girlishness  of her appearance had matured into the serene beauty of early womanhood. The golden  tints of her hair had deepened into rich auburn, her gray eyes looked darker under  the shadow of her dark brows. The Signora and Richard Thornton declared that she  had altered very much since she had left them, and were surprised at her matured  beauty when she went to spend a brief Christmas holiday with her old friends. She  bought the silk gown for Eliza Piccirillo, and the meerschaum pipe for poor Dick,  who needed no memorial of his adopted sister, for her image haunted him only too  perpetually, to the destruction of all other images which might else have found  a place in the scene-painter&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane felt a pang of remorse as she remembered how very easily she had borne her  separation from these faithful friends. It was not that she loved them less, or  forgot their goodness to her. She had no such ingratitude as that wherewith to reproach  herself; but she felt as if she had committed a sin against them in being happy  in the calm serenity of Hazlewood.</p>
<p>She  said this to Richard Thornton during the brief Christmas visit. They had walked  out once more in the quiet streets and squares in the early winter twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel  as if I had grown selfish and indifferent,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The months pass one after  another. It is two years and a half since my father died, and I am not one step  nearer to the discovery of the man who caused his death. Not one step. I am buried  alive at Hazlewood. I am bound hand and foot. What can I do, Richard; what can I  do? I could go mad almost when I remember that I am a poor helpless girl, and that  I may never be able to keep the oath I swore when I first read my dead father&rsquo;s  letter. And you, Richard, in all this time you have done nothing to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  scene-painter shook his head sadly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  can I do, my dear Eleanor? What I told you nearly a year ago, I tell you again now.  This man will never be found. What hope have we? what chance of finding him? We  might hear his name to-morrow, and we should not know it. If either of us met him  in the street, we should pass him by. We might live in the same house with him,  and be ignorant of his presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Richard,&rdquo; cried Eleanor Vane. &ldquo;I think if I met that man some instinct of hate and  horror would reveal his identity to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  poor romantic Nelly, you talk as if life was a melodrama. No, my dear, I say again,  this man will never be found; the story of your father&rsquo;s death is unhappily a common  one. Let that sad story rest, Nell, with all the other mournful records of the past.  Believe me that you cannot do better than be happy at Hazlewood; happy in your innocent  life, and utterly forgetful of the foolish vow you made when you were little better  than a child. If all the improbabilities that you have ever dreamt of were to come  to pass, and vengeance were in your grasp, I hope and believe, Nell, that a better  spirit would arise within you, and prompt you to let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton spoke very seriously. He had never been able to speak of Eleanor&rsquo;s scheme  of retribution without grief and regret. He recognised the taint of her father&rsquo;s  influence in this vision of vengeance and destruction. All George Vane&rsquo;s notions  of justice and honour had been rather the meretricious and flimsy ideas of a stage  play, than the common-sense views of real life. He had talked incessantly to his  daughter about days of retribution; gigantic vengeances which were looming somewhere  in the far-away distance, for the ultimate annihilation of the old man&rsquo;s enemies.  This foolish, ruined spendthrift, who cried out against the world because his money  was spent, and his place in that world usurped by wiser men, had been Eleanor&rsquo;s  teacher during her most impressionable years. It was scarcely to be wondered at,  then, that there were some flaws in the character of this motherless girl, and that  she was ready to mistake a pagan scheme of retribution for the Christian duty of  filial love.</p>
<p>Midsummer  had come and gone, when an event occurred to break the tranquillity of that simple  household.</p>
<p>The  two girls had lingered late in the garden one evening early in July. Mrs. Darrell  sat writing in the breakfast-parlour. The lamplight glimmered under the shadow of  the verandah, and the widow&rsquo;s tall figure seated at her desk was visible through  the open bay-window.</p>
<p>Laura  and her companion had been talking for a long time, but Eleanor had lapsed into  silence at last, and stood against the low white gate with her elbow resting upon  the upper bar, looking thoughtfully out into the lane. Miss Mason was never the  first to be tired of talking. A silvery torrent of innocent babble was for ever  gushing from her red, babyish lips; so, when at last Eleanor grew silent and absent-minded,  the heiress was fain to talk to her dogs, her darling silky Skye, whose great brown  eyes looked out from a ball of floss silk that represented the animal&rsquo;s head; and  her Italian greyhound, a slim shivering brute, who wore a coloured flannel paletot,  and exhibited a fretful and whimpering disposition, far from agreeable to any one  but his mistress.</p>
<p>There  was no moon upon this balmy July night, and the hulking hobadahoy of all work came  out to light the lamp while the two girls were standing at the gate. This lamp gave  a pleasant aspect to the cottage upon dark nights, and threw a bright line of light  into the darkness of the lane.</p>
<p>The  boy had scarcely retired with his short ladder and flaming lantern, when the two  pet dogs began to bark violently, and a man came out of the darkness into the line  of lamplight.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason gave a startled scream, but Eleanor caught her by the arm, to check her foolish  outcry.</p>
<p>There  was nothing very alarming in the aspect of the man. He was only a tramp: not a common  beggar, but a shabby-genteel-looking tramp, whose threadbare coat was of a fashionable  make, and who, in spite of his ragged slovenliness, had something the look of a  gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Darrell still lives here, does she not?&rdquo; he asked rather eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  Eleanor who answered. The dogs were still barking and Laura was still looking very  suspiciously at the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you tell her, please, that she is wanted out here by some one who has something  important to communicate to her,&rdquo; the man said.</p>
<p>Eleanor  was going towards the house to deliver this message, when she saw Mrs. Darrell coming  across the lawn. She had been disturbed at her writing by the barking of the dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is the matter, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; she asked, sharply. &ldquo;Who are you and Laura talking  to, out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  walked from the two girls to the man, who stood back a little way outside the gate,  with the lamplight shining full upon his face.</p>
<p>The  widow looked sternly at this man who had dared to come to the gate at nightfall  and to address the two girls under her charge.</p>
<p>But  her face changed as she looked at him, and a wild cry broke from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot,  Launcelot, my son!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Launcelot</b></h2>
<p>Mrs. Darrell stood for some time clasped in her son&rsquo;s embrace, and  sobbing violently. The two girls withdrew a few paces, too bewildered to know what  to do, in the first shock of the surprise that had come so suddenly upon them.</p>
<p>This  was Launcelot Darrell, then, the long absent son, whose portrait hung above the  mantelpiece in the dining-room, whose memory was so tenderly cherished, every token  of whose former presence was so carefully preserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  boy, my boy,&rdquo; murmured the widow, in a voice which seemed strange to the two girls,  from its new accent of tenderness; &ldquo;my own and only son, how is it that you come  back to me thus? I thought you were in India. I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  in India,  mother, when my last letter to you was written,&rdquo; the young man answered; &ldquo;but you  know how sick and tired I was of the odious climate, and the odious life I was compelled  to lead. It grew unbearable at last, and I determined to throw everything up, and  come home; so I sailed in the first vessel that left Calcutta after I had formed this determination.  You&rsquo;re not sorry to see me back, are you, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry  to see you, my boy, my boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell led her son across the lawn and into the house, through an open window.  She seemed utterly unconscious of the presence of her two charges. She seemed to  have forgotten their very existence in the wonderful surprise of her son&rsquo;s return.  So Laura and Eleanor went up to Miss Mason&rsquo;s room and shut themselves in, to talk  over the strange adventures of the evening, while the mother and son were closeted  together in the breakfast-room below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  it all romantic, Nelly, dear?&rdquo; Miss Mason said, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;I wonder whether  he came all the way from India  in that dreadful coat and that horrid shabby hat? He looks just like the hero of  a novel, doesn&rsquo;t he, Nell? dark and pale, and tall and slender. Has he come back  for good, do you think? I&rsquo;m sure he ought to have Mr. De Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Vane shrugged her shoulders. She was not particularly interested in the handsome  prodigal son who had made his appearance so unexpectedly; and she had enough to  do to listen to all Laura&rsquo;s exclamations, and sympathise with her curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t  sleep a bit to-night, Nelly,&rdquo; Miss Mason said, as she parted with her friend. &ldquo;I  shall be dreaming of Launcelot Darrell, with his dark eyes and pale face. What a  fierce, half-angry look he has, Nell, as if he were savage with the world for having  treated him badly. For he must have been badly treated, you know. We know how clever  he is. He ought to have been made a governor-general or an ambassador, or something  of that kind, in India.  He has no right to be shabby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should  think his shabbiness was his own fault, Laura,&rdquo; Miss Vane answered, quietly. &ldquo;If  he is clever, you know, he ought to be able to earn money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  thought of Richard Thornton, as she spoke, working at the Ph&oelig;nix Theatre for the  poor salary that helped to support the Bohemian comforts of the primitive shelter  in the Pilasters, and Dick&rsquo;s paint and whitewash bespattered coat seemed glorified  by contrast with that of the young prodigal in the room below.</p>
<p>The  two girls went down to the breakfast-room early the next morning, Laura Mason arrayed  in her prettiest and brightest muslin morning dress, which was scarcely so bright  as her beaming face. The young lady&rsquo;s gossamer white robes fluttered with the floating  ribbons and delicate laces that adorned them. She was a coquette by nature, and  was eager to take her revenge for all the monotonous days of enforced seclusion  which she had endured.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell was sitting at the breakfast table when the two girls entered the room.  Her Bible lay open amongst the cups and saucers near her. Her face was pale, and  looked even more care-worn than usual, and her eyes were dimmed by the tears that  she had shed. The heroism of the woman who had borne her son&rsquo;s absence silently  and uncomplainingly, had given way under the unlooked-for joy of his return.</p>
<p>She  gave her hand to each of the girls as they wished her good morning. Eleanor almost  shuddered as she felt the deadly coldness of that wasted hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  will begin breakfast at once, my dears,&rdquo; Mrs. Darrell said, quietly; &ldquo;my son is  fatigued by a long journey, and exhausted by the excitement of his return. He will  not get up, therefore, until late in the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  widow poured out the tea, and for some little time there was silence at the breakfast  table. Neither Eleanor nor Laura liked to speak. They both waited&mdash;one patiently,  the other very impatiently&mdash;until Mrs. Darrell should please to tell them something  about her son&rsquo;s extraordinary return.</p>
<p>It seemed  as if the mistress of Hazlewood, usually so coldly dignified and self-possessed,  felt some little embarrassment in speaking of the strange scene of the previous  night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need  scarcely tell you, Laura,&rdquo; she said, rather abruptly, after a very long pause, &ldquo;that  if anything could lessen my happiness in my son&rsquo;s return, it would be the manner  of his coming back to his old home. He comes back to me poorer than when he went  away. He came on foot from Southampton here; he  came looking like a tramp and a beggar to his mother&rsquo;s house. But it would be hard  if I blamed my poor boy for this. The sin lies at his uncle&rsquo;s door. Maurice de Crespigny  should have known that Colonel Darrell&rsquo;s only son would never stoop to a life of  commercial drudgery. My son&rsquo;s letters might have prepared me for what has happened.  Their brevity, their bitter, despondent tone, might have told the utter hopelessness  of a commercial career for my son. He tells me that he left India because his  position there,&mdash;a position which held out no promise of improvement,&mdash;had become  unbearable to him. He comes back to me penniless, with the battle of life before  him. You can scarcely wonder, then, that my happiness in his return is not quite  unalloyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  indeed, dear Mrs. Darrell,&rdquo; Laura answered, eagerly; &ldquo;but still you must be very  glad to have him back: and if he didn&rsquo;t make a fortune in India, he can make one in England, I dare say. He is so handsome,  and so clever, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young lady stopped suddenly, blushing under the cold scrutiny of Ellen Darrell&rsquo;s  eyes. Perhaps in that moment a thought flashed across the mind of the widow; the  thought of a wealthy marriage for her handsome son. She knew that Laura Mason was  rich, for Mr. Monckton had told her that his ward would have all the advantages  in after life which wealth can bestow, but she had no idea of the amount of the  girl&rsquo;s fortune.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell slept late after his pedestrian journey. Miss Mason&rsquo;s piano was kept shut,  out of consideration for the traveller; and Laura and Eleanor found the bright summer&rsquo;s  morning unusually long in consequence. They had so few pursuits, or amusements,  that to be deprived of one seemed very cruel. They were sitting after their early  dinner, in a shady nook in the shrubbery, Laura lying on the ground, reading a novel,  and Eleanor engaged in some needle-work achievement which was by-and-bye to be presented  to the Signora; when the rustling leaves of the laurel screen that inclosed and  sheltered their retreat, were parted, and the handsome face, the face which had  looked worn and haggard last night, but which now had only an aristocratic air of  languor, presented itself before them in a frame of dark and shining foliage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good  morning, or good afternoon, young ladies,&rdquo; said Mr. Darrell, &ldquo;for I hear that your  habits at Hazlewood are very primitive, and that you dine at three o&rsquo;clock. I have  been looking for you during the last half-hour, in my anxiety to apologise for any  alarm I may have given you last night. When the landless heir returns to his home,  he scarcely expects to find two angels waiting for him on the threshold. I might  have been a little more careful of my toilet, had I been able to foresee my reception.  What luggage I had I left at Southampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  never mind your dress, Mr. Darrell,&rdquo; Laura answered gaily, &ldquo;we are both so glad  you have come home. Ain&rsquo;t we, Eleanor? for our lives are so dreadfully dull here,  though your mamma is very kind to us. But do tell us all about your voyage home,  and your journey here on foot, and all the troubles you have gone through? Do tell  us your adventures, Mr. Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young lady lifted her bright blue eyes with a languishing glance of pity; but suddenly  dropped them under the young man&rsquo;s glance. He looked from one to the other of the  two girls, and then, strolling into the grassy little amphitheatre where they were  sitting, flung himself into a rustic arm-chair, near the table at which Eleanor  Vane sat at work.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell was a handsome likeness of his mother. The features which in her face were  stern and hard, had in his an almost feminine softness. The dark eyes had a lazy  light in them, and were half-hidden by the listless droop of the black lashes that  fringed their full white lids. The straight nose, low forehead, and delicately moulded  mouth, were almost classical in their physical perfection; but there was a want  in the lower part of the face; the chin receded a little where it should have projected,  the handsome mouth was weak and undecided in expression.</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell might have sat as a painter&rsquo;s model for all the lovers in prose or poetry;  but he would never have been mistaken for a hero or a statesman. He had all the  attributes of grace and beauty, but not one of the outward signs of greatness. Eleanor  Vane felt this want of power in the young man as she looked at him. Her rapid perception  seized upon the one defect which marred so much perfection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I had need of help against the murderer of my father,&rdquo; the girl thought, &ldquo;I would  not ask this man to aid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  now, Mr. Darrell,&rdquo; said Laura, throwing down her book, and settling herself for  a flirtation with the prodigal son, &ldquo;tell us all your adventures. We are dying to  hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  adventures, my dear Miss Mason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  your Indian experiences, of course, and your journey home. All your romantic escapes,  and thrilling perils, tiger-hunting, pig-sticking&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t sound romantic, but  I suppose it is&mdash;lonely nights in which you lost yourself in the jungle, horrible  encounters with rattle-snakes, brilliant balls at Government House&mdash;you see I know  all about Indian life&mdash;rides on the race-course, flirtations with Calcutta belles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man laughed at Miss Mason&rsquo;s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know more about the delights of an Indian existence than I do,&rdquo; he said, rather  bitterly; &ldquo;a poor devil who goes out to Calcutta with only one letter of introduction,  and an empty purse, and is sent up the country, within a few days of his arrival,  to a lonely station, where his own face is about the only white one in the neighbourhood,  hasn&rsquo;t very much chance of becoming familiar with Government House festivities,  or Calcutta belles, who reserve their smiles for the favoured children of fortune,  I can assure you. As to tiger-hunts and pig-sticking, my dear Miss Mason, I can  give you very little information upon those points, for an indigo planter&rsquo;s overseer,  whose nose is kept pretty close to the grindstone, has enough to do for his pitiful  stipend, and very little chance of becoming a Gordon Gumming or a Jules Gerard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura  Mason looked very much disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t like India,  then, Mr. Darrell?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hated  it,&rdquo; the young man answered, between his set teeth.</p>
<p>There  was so much suppressed force in Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s utterance of these three words,  that Eleanor looked up from her work, startled by the young man&rsquo;s sudden vehemence.</p>
<p>He was  looking straight before him, his dark eyes fixed, his strongly marked eyebrows contracted,  and a red spot burning in the centre of each pale and rather hollow cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  why did you hate India?&rdquo;  Laura asked, with unflinching pertinacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  does a man hate poverty and humiliation, Miss Mason? You might as well ask me that.  Suppose we drop the subject. It isn&rsquo;t a very agreeable one to me, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  your voyage home,&rdquo; pursued Laura, quite unabashed by this rebuff; &ldquo;you can tell  us your adventures during the voyage home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had  no adventures. Men who travel by the overland route may have something to tell,  perhaps: I came the cheapest and the slowest way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  a sailing vessel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what was the name of the vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  <em>Indus</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  <em>Indus</em>, that&rsquo;s an easy name to remember. But of  course you had all sorts of amusements on board; you played whist in the cuddy&mdash;what  is the cuddy, by-the-bye?&mdash;and you got up private theatricals, and you started an  amateur newspaper, or a magazine, and you crossed the line, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, we went through the usual routine. It was dreary enough. Pray tell me something  about Hazlewood, Miss Mason; I am a great deal more interested in Berkshire than you can possibly be in my Indian experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young lady was fain to submit. She told Mr. Darrell such scraps and shreds of gossip  as form the &ldquo;news&rdquo; in a place like Hazlewood. He listened very attentively to anything  Miss Mason had to tell about his uncle, Maurice de Crespigny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  those tiger cats, my maiden aunts, are as watchful as ever,&rdquo; he said, when Laura  had finished. &ldquo;Heaven grant the harpies may be disappointed. Do any of the Vane  family ever try to get at the old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked up from her work, but very quietly; she had grown accustomed to hear her  name spoken by those who had no suspicion of her identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I believe not,&rdquo; Miss Mason answered; &ldquo;old Mr. Vane died two or three years ago,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  my mother wrote me word of his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  were in India  when it happened, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  face blanched, and her heart beat with a fierce heavy throbbing against her breast.  How dared they talk of her dead father in that tone of almost insolent indifference.  The one passion of her young life had as strong a power over her now as when she  had knelt in the little chamber in the Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que, with her clasped hands  uplifted to the low ceiling, and a terrible oath upon her girlish lips.</p>
<p>She  dropped her work suddenly, and rising from her rustic seat, walked away from the  shade of the laurels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor,&rdquo;  cried Laura Mason, &ldquo;where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell sat in a careless attitude, trifling with the reels of silk, and balls of  wool, and all the paraphernalia of fancy work scattered upon the table before him,  but he lifted his head as Laura uttered her friend&rsquo;s name, and perhaps for the first  time looked steadily at Miss Vane.</p>
<p>He sat  looking at her for some minutes while she and Laura stood talking together a few  paces from him. It was perhaps only a painter&rsquo;s habit of looking earnestly at a  pretty face that gave intensity to his gaze. He dropped his eyelids presently, and  drew a long breath, that sounded almost like a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An  accidental likeness,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;there are a hundred such likenesses in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got  up and walked back to the house, leaving the two girls together. Laura had a great  deal to say about his handsome face, and the easy grace of his manner; but Eleanor  Vane was absent and thoughtful. The mention of her father&rsquo;s name had brought back  the past. Her peaceful life, and all its quiet contentment, melted away like a curtain  of morning mist that rises to disclose the ghastly horror of a battle-field; and  the dreadful picture of the past arose before her; painfully vivid, horribly real.  The parting on the boulevard; the long night of agony and suspense; the meeting  with Richard on the bridge by the Morgue; her father&rsquo;s torn, disjointed letter;  and her own vengeful wrath; all returned to her; every voice of her heart seemed  to call her away from the commonplace tranquillity of her life to some desperate  act of justice and retribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  have I to do with this frivolous girl?&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;what is it to me whether Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s nose is Grecian or aquiline, whether his eyes are black or brown? What  a wretched, useless life I am leading in this place, when I should be hunting through  the world for the murderer of my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  sighed wearily as she remembered how powerless she was. What could she do to get  one step nearer to the accomplishment of that one purpose, which she called the  purpose of her life? Nothing! She remembered with a chill feeling of despair that  however, in her moments of exaltation, she might look forward to some shadowy day  of triumph and revenge, her better sense always told her that Richard Thornton had  spoken the truth. The man whose treachery had destroyed George Vane had dropped  into the chaos of an over-crowded universe, leaving no clue behind him by which  he might be traced.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  The Lawyer&rsquo;s Suspicion</b></h2>
<p>Mr. Monckton came to Hazlewood upon the day after Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  arrival. The grave solicitor had known the young man before his departure for India,  but there seemed no very great intimacy between them, and Mr. Darrell appeared rather  to avoid any familiarity with his mother&rsquo;s rich friend.</p>
<p>He answered  Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s questions about India and indigo-planting with an air  of unwillingness that was almost insolent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  last few years of my life have not been so very pleasant as to make me care to look  back at them,&rdquo; he said, bitterly. &ldquo;Some men keep a diary of the experiences of each  day&mdash;I found the experiences dreary enough in themselves, and had no wish to incur  the extra dreariness of writing about them. I told my uncle, when he forced a commercial  career upon me, that he was making a mistake, and the result has proved that I was  right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell spoke with as much indifference as if he had been discussing the affairs  of a stranger. He evidently thought that the mistakes of his life rested upon other  people&rsquo;s shoulders; and that it was no shame to him, but rather to his credit as  a fine gentleman, that he had come home penniless and shabby to sponge upon his  mother&rsquo;s slender income.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  now you have come back, what do you mean to do?&rdquo; Mr. Monckton asked, rather abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall  go in for painting. I&rsquo;ll work hard, down in this quiet place, and get a picture  ready for the Royal   Academy next year. Will you  sit for me, Miss Mason? and you, Miss Vincent? you would make a splendid Rosalind  and Celia. Yes, Mr. Monckton, I shall try the sublime art whose professors have  been the friends of princes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  if you fail&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I fail, I&rsquo;ll change my name, and turn itinerant portrait-painter. But I don&rsquo;t suppose  my uncle Maurice means to live for ever. He must leave his money to somebody, and  whatever wills he may have made&mdash;and I daresay he&rsquo;s made half a dozen&mdash;the chances  are that he&rsquo;ll tear the last of them up, half an hour before his death, and die  while he&rsquo;s thinking about the wording of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man spoke as carelessly as if the Woodlands fortune were scarcely worth a  discussion. It was his habit to speak indifferently of all things, and it was rather  difficult to penetrate his real sentiments, so skilfully were they hidden by this  surface manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  had a formidable rival once in your uncle&rsquo;s affections!&rdquo; Mr. Monckton said presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which  rival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Damon of Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s youth, George Vandeleur Vane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s face darkened at the mention of the dead man&rsquo;s name. It had always been  the habit of the De Crespigny family to look upon Eleanor&rsquo;s father as a subtle and  designing foe, against whom no warfare could be too desperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  uncle could never have been such a fool as to leave his money to that spendthrift,&rdquo;  Mr. Darrell said.</p>
<p>Eleanor  had been sitting at an open window bending over her work during this conversation;  but she rose hastily as Launcelot spoke of her father. She was ready to do battle  for him then and there, if need were. She was ready to fling off the disguise of  her false name, and to avow herself as George Vane&rsquo;s daughter, if they dared to  slander him. Whatever shame or humiliation was cast upon him should be shared by  her.</p>
<p>But  before she could give way to this sudden impulse, Gilbert Monckton spoke, and the  angry girl waited to hear what he might say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  every reason to believe that Maurice de Crespigny would have left his money to his  old friend had Mr. Vane lived,&rdquo; the lawyer said. &ldquo;I never shall forget your uncle&rsquo;s  grief when he read the account of the old man&rsquo;s death in a &lsquo;Galignani&rsquo; which was  put purposely in his way by one of your aunts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Mr. Darrell, bitterly, &ldquo;George Vane&rsquo;s death cleared the way for those harpies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or  for you, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.  I have not come home to wait for a dead man&rsquo;s shoes, Mr. Monckton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell had been listening to this conversation, with her watchful eyes fixed upon  Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s face. She spoke now for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  is only one person who has a right to inherit my uncle&rsquo;s fortune,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and  that person is my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  glanced at the young man as she spoke; and in that one kindling glance of maternal  pride the widow revealed how much she loved her son.</p>
<p>The  young man was leaning in a lounging attitude over the piano, turning the leaves  of Laura&rsquo;s open music-book, and now and then striking his fingers on the notes.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton took up his hat, shook hands with his ward and with Mrs. Darrell, and paused  by the window at which Eleanor sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  silent you have been this morning, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The  girl blushed as she looked up at the lawyer&rsquo;s grave face. She always felt ashamed  of her false name when Mr. Monckton addressed her by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  are you and Laura coming to see my new picture?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever  Mrs. Darrell likes to bring us,&rdquo; Eleanor answered, frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  hear, Mrs. Darrell?&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;these two young ladies are coming over to  Tolldale to see a genuine Raphael that I bought at Christie&rsquo;s a month ago. You will  be taking your son to see his uncle, I have no doubt&mdash;suppose you come and lunch  at the Priory on the day you go to Woodlands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  will be to-morrow,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Darrell. &ldquo;My uncle cannot deny himself to Launcelot  after an absence of nearly five years, and even my sisters can scarcely have the  impertinence to shut the door in my son&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well; Woodlands and the Priory lie close together. You can cross the park and get  into Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s grounds by the wicket-gate, and so surprise the enemy. That  will be the best plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you please, my dear Mr. Monckton,&rdquo; said the widow.</p>
<p>She  was gratified at the idea of stealing a march upon her maiden sisters, for she knew  how difficult it was to effect an entrance to the citadel so jealously guarded by  them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  young ladies,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Monckton, as he crossed the threshold of the bay window,  &ldquo;will you honour me with your company to the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two girls rose and went out on-to the lawn with the lawyer. Laura Mason was accustomed  to obey her guardian, and Eleanor was very well pleased to pay all possible respect  to Gilbert Monckton. She looked up to him as something removed from the common-place  sphere in which she felt so fettered and helpless. She fancied sometimes that if  she could have told him the story of her father&rsquo;s death, he might have helped her  to find the old man&rsquo;s destroyer. She had that implicit confidence in his power which  a young and inexperienced girl almost always feels for a man of superior intellect  who is twenty years her senior.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton and the two girls walked slowly across the grass, but Laura Mason was distracted  by her dogs before she reached the gate, and ran away into one of the shrubberied  pathways after the refractory Italian greyhound.</p>
<p>The  lawyer stopped at the gate. He was silent for some moments, looking thoughtfully  at Eleanor, as if he had something particular to say to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Vincent, how do you like Mr. Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>
<p>The  question seemed rather insignificant after the pause that had preceded it.</p>
<p>Eleanor  hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely  know whether I like or dislike him,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he only came the night before last,  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  my question is what we call a leading one. Never mind, you shall tell me what you  think by-and-by, when you have had more time to form an opinion. You think the young  man handsome, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes! very handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you are not the girl to be fascinated by a handsome face. I can see that you mean  that by the contemptuous curl of your lip. Quite true, no doubt, Miss Vincent; but  there are some young ladies less strong-minded than yourself, who may be easily  bewitched by the delicate outline of a classical profile, or the light of a pair  of handsome dark eyes. Eleanor Vincent, do you remember what I said to you when  I brought you down to Hazlewood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton was in the habit of addressing both the girls by their Christian names  when he spoke seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I remember perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  I said to you then implied an amount of trust which I don&rsquo;t often put in an acquaintance  of a couple of hours. That little girl yonder,&rdquo; added the lawyer, glancing towards  the pathway in which Laura Mason flitted about, alternately coaxing and remonstrating  with her dogs, &ldquo;is tender-hearted and weak-headed. I think you would willingly do  anything to serve her, and me. You can do her no better service than by shielding  her from the influence of Launcelot Darrell. Don&rsquo;t let my ward fall in love with  the young man&rsquo;s handsome face, Miss Vincent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  was silent, scarcely knowing how to reply to this strange appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  think I am taking alarm too soon, I daresay,&rdquo; the lawyer said, &ldquo;but in our profession  we learn to look a long way ahead. I don&rsquo;t like the young man, Miss Vincent. He  is selfish, and shallow, and frivolous,&mdash;false, I think, as well. And, more than  this, there is a secret in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  and that secret is connected with his Indian experiences.&rdquo;</p>

  The Shadow On Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s Life</b></h2>
<p>Tolldale Priory was a red brick mansion, lying deep in a valley, almost  hidden amidst the thick woodland that surrounded it: a stately dwelling-place, shrouded  and well-nigh entombed by the old trees that shut it in on every side, and made  a screen through which only a glimpse of crimson brick could be seen from the bye-road  or lane that approached the great iron gates.</p>
<p>From  the hill-tops, high above that wooded valley, looking down into the sombre depths  of verdure, one could see the gabled roof of the mansion, glimmering amid the woodland,  like some rich jewel in its casket; and, at a little distance, the massive square  tower of an ivy-grown old church, at which a few tenant-farmers about Tolldale,  and the lords of the Priory and their retainers, were wont to worship.</p>
<p>The  house was large and handsome; there was a long banqueting hall with a roof of black  oak, rich in quaint and monstrous carvings, and a gloomy corridor, that were said  to belong to the reign of Henry the Second; but the rest of the mansion had been  built in the time of Queen Anne, and was of that prim and square order of architecture  which Sir John Vanbrugh and his followers affected.</p>
<p>The  garden was prim and square, like the house, and shut in from the road by high red  brick walls, over some part of which the stone-moss had crept, and the ivy trailed  for centuries; but the garden had grown out of the stiffness of Queen Anne&rsquo;s day,  for every tree and shrub, every flower and weed, patch of grass, or cluster of ivy,  grew so luxuriantly in this fertile valley, that it would have needed three times  the number of gardeners that had been kept at Tolldale for the last twenty years,  to preserve the neat order of the flower-beds and pathways, the holly hedges, the  huge bushes of boxwood that had once been fashioned into the grim semblances of  lions, swans, bears, and elephants, and all the other stiff beauties of the pleasure-grounds.</p>
<p>Behind  the house a couple of peacocks stalked moodily about a stony courtyard, and a great  watch-dog showed his sulky head at the mouth of his kennel, and barked incessantly  at the advent of any visitor, as if the Priory had been some weird and enchanted  dwelling to which no stranger had right of approach. The entrance to the house most  commonly used, opened into this stony courtyard; and in the dusky, flagged hall,  hung the ponderous and roomy riding-boots and the heavy saddle of some Tolldale  who had distinguished himself in the civil wars.</p>
<p>The  rainbow colours that glimmered on the stone pavement of this dusky entrance-hall  were reflected from the crests and coats of arms, the interlaced ciphers, the coronets  and bloody hands, emblazoned on the mullioned windows, whose splendour chastened  and subdued the daylight, tempering the garish glory of heaven for the benefit of  aristocratic eyes. But of all these crests and ciphers, of all these honourable  insignia, not one belonged to the present owner of the house&mdash;Mr. Gilbert Monckton,  the lawyer.</p>
<p>Tolldale  Priory had changed hands several times since the monkish days in which the older  part of the house had been built. Gilbert Monckton had bought the estate twenty  years before of a Mr. Ravenshaw, a reckless and extravagant gentleman, with an only  daughter, whose beauty had been very much talked about in the neighbourhood. Indeed,  report had gone so far as to declare that Gilbert Monckton had been desperately  in love with this Margaret Ravenshaw, and that it was for her sake he had invested  a great part of the splendid fortune left him by his father in the purchase of the  Tolldale estate; thereby freeing the young lady&rsquo;s father from very terrible embarrassments,  and enabling him to retire to the Continent with his only child.</p>
<p>There  had been, certainly, considerable grounds for this report, as immediately after  the transfer of the property, Gilbert Monckton quitted England, leaving his business  in the hands of the two junior partners of the house&mdash;both much older men than himself,  by-the-bye. He remained abroad for nearly two years, during which time everybody  believed him to be travelling with Mr. Ravenshaw and his daughter, and at the end  of that time returned; an altered man.</p>
<p>Yes,  every one who had been intimate with Gilbert Monckton declared that a blight had  fallen upon his life, and it was only natural that they should go a little further  than this, and conclude that this change had been brought about by an unhappy attachment;  or, in plainer words, that Margaret Ravenshaw had jilted him.</p>
<p>However  this might be, the lawyer kept his secret. There was no unmanly sentimentalism in  his nature. Whatever his sorrow was, he bore it very quietly, keeping it entirely  to himself, and asking sympathy from no living creature. But from the hour of his  return to England,  he devoted himself to his profession with a determination and an assiduity that  he had never before displayed.</p>
<p>This  was the great change that his disappointment&mdash;whatever that disappointment may have  been&mdash;had made in him. He did not become either a misanthrope or a bore. He became  purely and simply a man of business. The frank, light-hearted young squire, who  had shunned his father&rsquo;s office as if every sheet of parchment or scrap of red tape  had been infected by the pestilent vapours of a plague-stricken city, was transformed  into the patient and plodding lawyer, whose gigantic grasp of thought and unfailing  foresight were almost akin to genius.</p>
<p>For  ten years Tolldale Priory was uninhabited by its new master, and left in the care  of a snuff-taking old housekeeper and a deaf gardener, who effectually kept all  visitors at bay by a systematic habit of failing to hear the great bell at the iron  gates; which might clang never so loudly under the shadow of its wooden pent-house  without apparently producing the faintest impression upon the aural nerves of the  two superannuated guardians of the mansion. But at last the day came upon which  Mr. Monckton grew tired of his London dwelling-place  in a dingy square in Bloomsbury, and determined to take possession of his Berkshire estate. He sent a couple of upholsterers to Tolldale  Priory, with strict injunctions to set the old furniture in order, but to do nothing  more; not so much as to alter the adjustment of a curtain or the accustomed position  of a chair or table.</p>
<p>Perhaps  he wished to see the familiar rooms looking exactly as they had looked when he had  sat by Margaret Ravenshaw&rsquo;s side, a bright and hopeful lad of twenty. He kept the  snuff-taking old housekeeper and the deaf gardener, and brought his own small staff  of well-trained servants from London.  The town-bred servants would have willingly rebelled against their new dwelling-place,  and the verdant shades that seemed to shut them in from the outer world; but their  wages were too liberal to be resigned for any but a very powerful reason, and they  submitted as best they could to the dreary solitude of their new abode:</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton travelled backwards and forwards between Tolldale and London almost every day, driving to the station  in his phaeton in the morning, and being met by his groom on his return in the evening.  The lawyer&rsquo;s professional duties had taxed his strength to the utmost, and grave  physicians had prescribed country air and occasional repose as absolutely necessary  to him. For nearly ten years, therefore, he had lived at the Priory, forming few  acquaintances, and positively no friends. His most intimate associates had been  the De Crespignys. This had no doubt arisen from the circumstance of the Woodlands  estate adjoining Tolldale. Mr. Monckton accepted the acquaintances whom accident  forced upon him, but he sought none. Those who knew him best said that the shadow  which had so early fallen upon his life had never passed away.</p>
<p>Of course  Eleanor Vane had heard these things during her residence at Hazlewood. The knowledge  of them invested the grave lawyer with a halo of romance in her girlish eyes. He,  like herself, had his secret, and kept it faithfully.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Unforgotten</b></h2>
<p>Mrs. Darrell drove her son and the two girls to Tolldale Priory in  accordance with Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s wish. The widow had no particular desire to bring  either Laura or Eleanor into contact with her uncle, Maurice de Crespigny, for she  nourished that intense jealousy of all visitors who crossed the threshold of the  old man&rsquo;s house, which is only known to expectant heirs whose chances of a fortune  tremble in the wavering balance of an invalid&rsquo;s caprice. But Mrs. Darrell could  not afford to offend Mr. Monckton. He paid a high price for her protection of his  ward, and was by no means the sort of man to be thwarted with impunity.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell lolled by his mother&rsquo;s side, smoking a cigar and taking very little notice  of the blossoming hedgerows and glimpses of luxuriant pastoral landscape. The two  young ladies sat upon a low seat, with their backs to the ponies, and had therefore  ample opportunity of observing the prodigal son&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>For  the first time since Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s return Eleanor Vane did watch that handsome face,  seeking in it for some evidence of those words which Gilbert Monckton had spoken  to her the day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is selfish, and shallow, and frivolous; false, I think, as well; more than this,  he has a secret&mdash;a secret connected with his Indian experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  is what Mr. Monckton had said. Eleanor asked herself what right he had to say so  much?</p>
<p>It was  scarcely likely that a girl of Eleanor&rsquo;s age, so unaccustomed to all society, so  shut in from the outer world by her narrow and secluded life, could fail to be a  little interested in the handsome stranger, whose advent had not been without a  tinge of romance. She was interested in him, and all the more so because of that  which Gilbert Monckton had said to her. There was a secret in Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  life. How strange this was! Had every creature a secret, part of themselves, hidden  deep in their breasts, like that dark purpose of her own that had grown out of the  misery of her father&rsquo;s untimely death&mdash;some buried memory, whose influence was to  overshadow all their lives?</p>
<p>She  looked at the young man&rsquo;s face. It had an expression of half-defiant recklessness  which seemed almost habitual to it; but it was not the face of a happy man.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason was the only person who talked much during that drive to Tolldale. That young  lady&rsquo;s tongue ran on in a pretty, incessant babble, about nothing in particular.  The wild flowers in the hedgerows, the distant glimpses of country, the light clouds  floating in the summer sky, the flaming poppies in the yellowing corn, the noisy  fowl upon the margin of a pond, the shaggy horses looking over farm-yard gates,&mdash;every  object, animate and inanimate, between Hazlewood and Tolldale was the subject of  Miss Mason&rsquo;s remark. Launcelot Darrell looked at her now and then with an expression  of half-admiring amusement, and sometimes aroused himself to talk to her; but only  to relapse very quickly into a half-contemptuous, half-sulky silence.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton received his guests in a long low library, looking out into the neglected  garden; a dusky chamber, darkened by the shadows of trailing parasites that hung  over the narrow windows. But this room was an especial favourite with the grave  master of the house. It was here he sat during the long lonely evenings that he  spent at home. The drawing-rooms on the first-floor were only used upon those rare  occasions when the lawyer opened his house to his friends of long standing, dashing  clients, who were very well pleased to get a week&rsquo;s shooting in the woody coverts  about the Priory.</p>
<p>Neither  Laura nor Eleanor felt very enthusiastic about the Raphael, which seemed to the  two girls to represent an angular and rather repellent type of female beauty, but  Launcelot Darrell and his host entered into an artistic discussion that lasted until  luncheon was announced by the lawyer&rsquo;s grey-haired butler, a ponderous and dignified  individual who had lived with Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s father, and who was said to know  more about his master&rsquo;s history than was known by Gilbert&rsquo;s most intimate friends.</p>
<p>It was  nearly three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when luncheon was finished, and the party  set out to attempt an invasion upon Woodlands. Launcelot Darrell gave his arm to  his mother, who in a manner took possession of her son, and the two girls walked  behind with the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have never seen Mr. de Crespigny, I suppose, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton said,  as they went out of the iron gates and struck into a narrow pathway leading through  the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!  But I am very anxious to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  hesitated. She was for ever being reminded of her assumed name, and the falsehood  to which she had submitted out of deference to her half-sister&rsquo;s pride.</p>
<p>Fortunately  the lawyer did not wait for an answer to his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice  de Crespigny is a strange old man,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a very strange old man. I sometimes  think there is a disappointment in store for Launcelot Darrell; and for his maiden  aunts as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A disappointment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I doubt very much if either the maiden ladies or their nephew will get Maurice de  Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  to whom will he leave it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is not for me to answer that question, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I merely speculate  upon the chances, in perfect ignorance as to facts. Were I Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s legal  adviser, I should have no right to say as much as this; but as I am not, I am free  to discuss the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton and Eleanor were alone by this time, for Laura Mason had flitted on to  the party in advance, and was talking to Launcelot Darrell. The lawyer&rsquo;s face clouded  as he watched his ward and the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  remember what I said to you yesterday, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; he said, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  very much afraid of the influence that young man&rsquo;s handsome face may have upon my  poor frivolous ward; I would move her out of the way of that influence if I could,  but where could I remove her? Poor child! she has been shifted about enough already.  She seems happy at Hazlewood; very happy, with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Eleanor answered, frankly; &ldquo;we love each other very dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you would do anything to serve her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything  in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  is one way in which you might serve her,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice, as if speaking  to himself rather than to Eleanor, &ldquo;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did  not finish the sentence, but walked on in silence, with his eyes bent upon the ground.  He only looked up now and then to listen, with an uneasy expression, to the animated  conversation of Launcelot and Laura. They walked thus through the shadowy woodland,  where the rustling sound of a pheasant&rsquo;s flight amongst the brushwood and the gay  tones of Laura&rsquo;s voice only broke the silence.</p>
<p>Beyond  the wood they came to a grassy slope dotted by groups of trees, and bounded by an  invisible fence.</p>
<p>Here,  on the summit of a gentle elevation, stood a low white villa&mdash;a large and important  house&mdash;but built in the modern style, and very inferior to Tolldale Priory in dignity  and grandeur.</p>
<p>This  was Woodlands, the house which Maurice de Crespigny had built for himself some twenty  years before, and the house whose threshold had so long been jealously guarded by  the two maiden nieces of the invalid.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton looked at his watch as he and Eleanor joined Mrs. Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-past  three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Mr. de Crespigny generally takes an airing in his Bath-chair  at about this time in the afternoon. You see, I know the habits of the Citadel,  and know therefore how to effect a surprise. If we strike across the park we are  almost sure to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led  the way to a little gate in the fence. It was only fastened by a latch, and the  party entered the grassy enclosure.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane&rsquo;s heart beat violently. She was about to see her father&rsquo;s old and early friend,  that friend whom he had never been suffered to approach, to whom he had been forbidden  to appeal in the hour of his distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  my poor father could have written to Mr. de Crespigny for help when he lost that  wretched hundred pounds, he might have been saved from a cruel death,&rdquo; Eleanor thought.</p>
<p>Fortune  seemed to favour the invaders. In a shady avenue that skirted one side of the slope,  they came upon the old man and the two sisters. The maiden ladies walked on either  side of their uncle&rsquo;s Bath-chair, erect and formidable-looking as a couple of grenadiers.</p>
<p>Maurice  de Crespigny looked twenty years older than his spendthrift friend had looked up  to the hour of his death. His bent head nodded helplessly forward. His faded eyes  seemed dim and sightless. The withered hand lying idle upon the leathern apron of  the Bath-chair, trembled like a leaf shaken by the autumn wind. The shadow of approaching  death seemed to hover about this feeble creature, separating him from his fellow-mortals.</p>
<p>The  two maiden ladies greeted their sister with no very demonstrative cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen!&rdquo;  exclaimed Miss Lavinia, the elder of the two, &ldquo;this is an unexpected pleasure. I  am sure that both Susan and myself are charmed to see you; but as this is one of  our poor dear invalid&rsquo;s worst days, your visit is rather unfortunately timed. If  you had written, and given us notice of your coming&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  would have shut the door in my face,&rdquo; Mrs. Darrell said, resolutely. &ldquo;Pray do not  put yourself to the trouble of inventing any polite fictions on my account, Lavinia.  We understand each other perfectly. I came here by the back way, because I knew  I should be refused admittance at the front door. You keep watch well, Lavinia,  and I beg to compliment you upon your patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  widow had approached her uncle&rsquo;s chair, leaving the rest of the party in the background.  Pale and defiant, she did battle with her two sisters, fighting sturdily in the  cause of her idolised son; who seemed a great deal too listless and indifferent  to look after his own interests.</p>
<p>The  ladies in possession glared at their sister&rsquo;s pale face with spiteful eyes; they  were a little daunted by the widow&rsquo;s air of resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  are those people, Ellen Darrell?&rdquo; asked the younger of the two old maids. &ldquo;Do you  want to kill my uncle, that you bring a crowd of strangers to intrude upon him at  a time when his nerves are at their worst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  not brought a crowd of strangers. One of those people is my son, who has come to  pay his respects to his uncle after his return from India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot  Darrell returned!&rdquo; exclaimed the two ladies, simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  returned to look after his own interests; returned with very grateful feelings towards  those who prompted his being sent away from his native country to waste his youth  in an unhealthy climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Some</i> people get on in India,&rdquo;  Miss Lavinia de Crespigny said, spitefully; &ldquo;but I never thought Launcelot Darrell  would do any good there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  kind it was in you to advise his going, then,&rdquo; Mrs. Darrell answered promptly. Then  passing by the astonished Miss Lavinia, she went up to her uncle, and bent over  him.</p>
<p>The  old man looked up at his niece, but with no glance of recognition in his blue eyes,  which had grown pale with age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle  Maurice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Darrell, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  invalid nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, yes!&rdquo; he said; but there was a vacant smile upon his face, and it seemed as  if the words were uttered mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  are you glad to see me, dear uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, yes,&rdquo; the old man answered, in exactly the same tone.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell looked up hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  he always like this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  answered Miss Susan, briskly, &ldquo;he is only so when he is intruded upon and annoyed.  We told you it was one of your uncle&rsquo;s bad days, Ellen; and yet you are heartless  enough to insist on persecuting him.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell turned upon her sister with suppressed rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  will the day come in which I shall be welcome to this place, Susan de Crespigny?&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;I choose my own time, and seize any chance I can of speaking to my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  looked back at the group she had left behind her, and beckoned to her son.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell came straight to his uncle&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  remember Launcelot, Uncle Maurice,&rdquo; Mrs. Darrell said, entreatingly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you  remember Launcelot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two maiden sisters watched their uncle&rsquo;s face with eager and jealous glances. It  seemed as if the thick clouds were fading away from the old man&rsquo;s memory, for a  faint light kindled in his faded eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot!&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;yes, I remember Launcelot. In India,  poor lad, in India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  went to India,  dear uncle, and he has been away some years. You remember how unfortunate he was;  the indigo planter to whom he was to have gone failed before he got to Calcutta, so that my poor boy  could not even deliver the one letter of introduction which he took with him to  a strange country. He was thrown upon his own resources, therefore, and had to get  a living as he could. The climate never agreed with him, Uncle Maurice, and he was  altogether very unhappy. He stayed as long as he could endure a life that was utterly  unsuited to him; and then flung everything up for the sake of returning to England.  You must not be angry with my poor boy, dear Uncle Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  old man seemed to have brightened up a good deal by this time. He nodded perpetually  as his niece talked to him, but there was a look of intelligence in his face now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  not angry with him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he was free to go, or free to return. I did the best  I could for him; but of course he was free to choose his own career, and is so still.  I don&rsquo;t expect him to defer to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell turned pale. This speech appeared to express a renunciation of all interest  in her son. She would almost rather that her uncle had been angry and indignant  at the young man&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  Launcelot wishes to please you in all he does, dear uncle,&rdquo; pleaded the widow. &ldquo;He  will be very, very sorry if he has offended you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is very good,&rdquo; the old man answered; &ldquo;he has not offended me. He is quite free,  quite free to act for himself. I did the best I could for him&mdash;I did the best; but  he is perfectly free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two maiden sisters exchanged a look of triumph. In this hand-to-hand contest for  the rich man&rsquo;s favour, it did not seem as if either Ellen Darrell or her son were  gaining any great advantage.</p>
<p>Launcelot  bent over his great-uncle&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  very happy to find you alive and well, sir, on my return,&rdquo; he said, respectfully.</p>
<p>The  old man lifted his eyes, and looked earnestly at the handsome face bent over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are very good, nephew,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I sometimes think that, because I have a little  money to leave behind me, everybody wishes for my death. It&rsquo;s hard to fancy that  every breath one draws is grudged by those who live with us. That&rsquo;s very hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo;  cried the maiden nieces, simultaneously, with a little shriek of lady-like horror.  &ldquo;When have you ever fancied that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  old man shook his head, with a feeble smile upon his tremulous lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are very good to me, my dears,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;very good; but sick men have strange fancies.  I sometimes think I&rsquo;ve lived too long for myself and others. But never mind that;  never mind that. Who are those people there?&rdquo; he asked, in a different tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends  of mine, uncle,&rdquo; Mrs. Darrell answered; &ldquo;and one of them is a friend of yours. You  know Mr. Monckton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monckton!  O, yes&mdash;yes! Monckton, the lawyer,&rdquo; muttered the old man; &ldquo;and who is that girl yonder?&rdquo;  he cried suddenly, with quite an altered voice and manner, almost as if the shock  of some great surprise had galvanised him into new life. &ldquo;Who is that girl yonder,  with fair hair and her face turned this way? Tell me who she is, Ellen Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed  to Eleanor Vane as he spoke. She was standing a little way apart from Gilbert Monckton  and Laura; she had taken off her broad straw hat and slung it across her arm, and  the warm summer breeze had swept the bright auburn hair from her forehead. Forgetful  of every necessity for caution, in the intensity of her desire to see her dead father&rsquo;s  dearest friend, she had advanced a few paces from her companions, and stood watching  the group about the old man&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  is she, Ellen Darrell?&rdquo; repeated Mr. de Crespigny.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell looked almost frightened by her uncle&rsquo;s eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  young lady is only the musical instructress of another young lady I have in my care,  Uncle Maurice,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;What is there in her that attracts your attention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  old man&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears that rolled slowly down his withered cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  George Vane and I were students together at Maudlin,&rdquo; answered Maurice de Crespigny,  &ldquo;my friend was the living image of that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell turned sharply round, and looked at Eleanor as if she would have almost  annihilated the girl for daring to resemble George Vane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  your eyes must deceive you, my dear uncle,&rdquo; said the widow; &ldquo;I knew Mr. George Vane  well enough, and I never saw any likeness to him in this Miss Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice  de Crespigny shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  eyes do not deceive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my memory that&rsquo;s weak sometimes; my eyesight  is good enough. When you knew George Vane his hair was grey, and his handsome looks  faded; when I first knew him he was as young as that girl yonder, and he was like  her. Poor George! poor George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  three sisters looked at each other. Whatever enmity might exist between Mrs. Darrell  and the two maiden ladies, the three were perfectly agreed upon one point&mdash;namely,  that the recollection of George Vane and his family must, at any price, be kept  out of Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>The  old man had not spoken of his friend for years, and the maiden sisters had triumphed  in the thought that all memories of their uncle&rsquo;s youth had become obscured and  obliterated by the gathering shadows of age. But now, at the sight of a fair-haired  girl of eighteen, the old memories came back in all their force. The sudden outburst  of feeling came upon the sisters like a thunderbolt, and they lost that common instinct  of self-preservation, that ordinary presence of mind, which would have prompted  them to hustle the old man off, and carry him at once out of the way of this tiresome,  intrusive, fair-haired young woman who had the impertinence to resemble George Vane.</p>
<p>The  sisters had never heard of the birth of Mr. Vane&rsquo;s youngest daughter. Many years  had elapsed since the intercourse between Mrs. Darrell and Hortensia Bannister had  extended to more than an occasional epistolary communication, and the stockbroker&rsquo;s  widow had not thought it necessary to make any formal announcement of her half-sister&rsquo;s  birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  that girl to come here,&rdquo; cried Maurice de Crespigny, pointing with a trembling hand  to Eleanor. &ldquo;Let her come here, I want to look at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell thought it would be scarcely wise to oppose her uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Vincent!&rdquo; she called, sharply, to the girl; &ldquo;come here, if you please, my uncle  wishes to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane was startled by the widow&rsquo;s summons, but she came eagerly to the old man&rsquo;s  chair. She was very anxious to see the friend of her dead father. She went close  up to the Bath-chair, and stood beside the old man.</p>
<p>Maurice  de Crespigny laid his hand upon hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;yes, yes. It&rsquo;s almost the same face&mdash;almost the same. God bless you, my  dear! It makes me fifty years younger to look at you. You are like a friend who  was once very dear to me&mdash;very dear to me. God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  girl&rsquo;s face grew pale with the intensity of her feeling. Oh! that her father had  been alive; that she might have pleaded for him with this old man, and have reunited  the broken links of the past. But of what avail now were Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s  compassionate words? They could not recalSl the dead. They could not blot out the  misery of that dreadful eleventh of August&mdash;that horrible night upon which the loss  of a pitiful sum of money had driven George Vane to the commission of the fatal  act which had ended his life. No! His old friend could do nothing for him, his loving  daughter could do nothing for him now&mdash;except to avenge his death.</p>
<p>Carried  away by her feelings, forgetful of her assumed character, forgetful of everything  except that the hand now clasped in hers was the same that had been linked in that  of her father, years and years ago, in the warm grasp of friendship, Eleanor Vane  knelt down beside the old man&rsquo;s chair, and pressed his thin fingers to her lips.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Like The Memory Of A Dream</b></h2>
<p>Mrs. Darrell drove away from Tolldale Priory late in the afternoon,  and in a very despondent state of mind. She had done no good by her visit to Woodlands,  and it seemed painfully probable that she had done a great deal of harm; for the  unfortunate accident of a resemblance between Laura Mason&rsquo;s companion and the late  George Vane had stirred up the memories of the past in that turbid stream, the old  man&rsquo;s mind. The widow scarcely opened her lips during the homeward drive. She would  fain have punished Eleanor for that unhappy chance by which she happened to resemble  the dead man, and she had not failed to remark unpleasantly upon Miss Vane&rsquo;s conduct  at Woodlands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One  would really think you wished to trade upon your likeness to Mr. Vane, and to insinuate  yourself into my uncle&rsquo;s good graces, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; the widow said, rather sharply.</p>
<p>Eleanor  blushed crimson, but did not attempt to reply to her employer&rsquo;s bitter speech. The  falsehood of an assumed name was perpetually placing her in positions against which  her truthful nature revolted.</p>
<p>If Mrs.  Darrell had been free to dismiss Eleanor Vane, she would doubtless have done so,  for the girl&rsquo;s presence had now become a source of alarm to her. There were two  reasons for this sentiment of alarm. First, the likeness which Maurice de Crespigny  had discovered between Eleanor and his dead friend, and which might prompt him at  any moment to some capricious fancy for the girl; and, secondly, the fact that Eleanor&rsquo;s  beauty and fascinations might not be without their effect upon Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>The  widow knew by cruel experience that her son was not a man to surrender his lightest  caprice at the entreaty of another. At seven-and-twenty years of age he was as much  a spoiled child as he had been at seven. Ellen Darrell looked back at the bitter  trials of the past, and remembered how hard it had been to keep her son true even  to his own interests. Selfish and self-willed, he had taken his own way; always  relying upon his handsome face, his shallow versatility, his showy accomplishments,  to carry him through every difficulty, and get him out of every dilemma; always  eager for the enjoyment of the present hour, and reckless as to any penalties to  be paid in the future.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell had concentrated every feeling of her heart into one passion: her love for  this young man. Frigid and reserved to others, with him she was impulsive, vehement,  spontaneous, ready to pour out her heart&rsquo;s blood at his feet, if he had needed such  an evidence of her devotion. For him she was jealous and exacting; harsh to others;  desperate and unforgiving to those whom she thought his enemies.</p>
<p>For  Launcelot she was anxious and ambitious. The hope that her uncle Maurice would leave  his fortune to the young man, or, on the other hand, would die without a will, thus  leaving Launcelot to succeed as heir-at-law, never entirely deserted her. But, even  if that hope should fail, her sisters were elderly women like herself. If they succeeded  in cajoling Maurice de Crespigny out of his fortune, they must surely eventually  leave it to their only nephew, Launcelot. This was how the widow reasoned. But there  was another chance which she fancied she saw for her son&rsquo;s advancement. Laura Mason,  the heiress, evidently admired the young man&rsquo;s handsome face and dashing manners.  What more likely than that Launcelot might succeed in winning the hand and fortune  of that capricious young lady?</p>
<p>Under  these circumstances Mrs. Darrell would have been very glad to have removed Eleanor  Vane out of her son&rsquo;s way; but this was not easily to be done. When the widow sounded  Laura Mason upon the subject, and dimly suggested the necessity of parting with  Eleanor, the heiress burst into a flood of tears, and declared passionately that  she would not live without her darling Nelly; and when Mrs. Darrell went even further  than this, and touched upon the subject in a conversation with Mr. Monckton, the  lawyer replied very decidedly that he considered Miss Vincent&rsquo;s companionship of  great benefit to his ward, and that he could not hear of any arrangement by which  the two girls would be separated.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell, therefore, could do nothing but submit, in the hope that for once her son  might consent to be governed by his interests, rather than by those erratic impulses  which had led him in the reckless and riotous days of his early youth.</p>
<p>She  pleaded with him, entreating him to be prudent and thoughtful for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have suffered so much from poverty, Launcelot,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;that surely you will  lose no opportunity of improving your position. Look back, my boy; remember that  bitter time in which you were lost to me, led away by low and vicious companions,  and only apppealing to me when you found yourself in debt and difficulty. Think  of your Indian life, and the years you have wasted,&mdash;you who are so clever and accomplished,  and who ought to have been so fortunate. Oh, Launcelot, if you knew what a bitter  thing it is to a mother to see her idolised child waste every opportunity of winning  the advancement which should be his by right,&mdash;yes, by right, Launcelot, by the right  of your talents. I never reproached you, my boy, for coming home to me penniless.  Were you to return to me twenty times, as you came back that night, you would always  find the same welcome, the same affection. My love for you will never change, my  darling, till I go to my grave. But I suffer very bitterly when I think of your  wasted youth. You must be rich, Launcelot; you cannot afford to be poor. There are  some men to whom poverty seems a spur that drives them on to greatness, but it has  clogged your footsteps, and held you back from the fame you might have won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad,  so it has, mother,&rdquo; the young man answered, bitterly; &ldquo;a shabby coat paralyses a  man&rsquo;s arm, to my mind, and it&rsquo;s not very easy for a fellow to hold his head very  high when the nap&rsquo;s all worn off his hat. But I don&rsquo;t mean to sit down to a life  of idleness, I can tell you, mother; I shall turn painter. You know I&rsquo;ve got on  with my painting pretty well during the last few years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad of that, my dear boy. You had plenty of time to devote to your painting, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty  of time; oh, yes, I was pretty well off for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you were not so hard worked in India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  always. That depended upon circumstances,&rdquo; the young man answered, indifferently.  &ldquo;Yes, mother, I shall turn painter, and try and make a fortune out of my brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell sighed. She wished to see her son made rich by a quicker road than the slow  and toilsome pathway by which an artist reaches fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you could make a wealthy marriage, Launcelot,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you might afford to devote  yourself to art, without having to endure the torturing anxieties which must be  suffered by a man who has only his profession to depend upon. I wouldn&rsquo;t for the  world wish you to sell yourself for money, for I know the wretchedness of a really  mercenary marriage; but if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man flung back the dark hair from his forehead, and smiled at his mother as  he interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I should fall in love with this Miss Laura Mason, who, according to your account,  is to have a power of money one of these days, I should prove myself a wise man.  That&rsquo;s what you mean, isn&rsquo;t it, <i>madre mia?</i> Well, I&rsquo;ll do my best. The young  lady is pretty, but her childishness is positively <i>impayable</i>. What&rsquo;s the  amount of the fortune that is to counterbalance so much empty-headed frivolity?  Eh, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  quite answer that question, Launcelot. I only know that Mr. Monckton told me Laura  will be very rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  Gilbert Monckton, although a lawyer, is one of those uncompromising personages who  never tell a lie. Well, mother, we&rsquo;ll see about it; I can&rsquo;t say anything more than  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man had been standing before his easel with his palette and brushes in his  hand during this conversation, now and then putting a touch here and there into  a picture that he had been working at since his return. He had taken up his abode  in his old apartments. His mother spent a good deal of her time with him; sitting  at needlework by the open window, while he painted; listening while, in his idler  moments, he sat at the piano, composing a few bars of a waltz, or trying to recall  some song that he had written long ago; always following him with watchful and admiring  eyes, shadowed only by the mother&rsquo;s anxiety for her son&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell did not seem to be altogether a bad young man. He accepted his mother&rsquo;s  love with something of that indolent selfishness common to those spoiled children  of fortune upon whom an extra share of maternal devotion has been lavished. He absorbed  the widow&rsquo;s affection, and gave her in return an easy-going, graceful attention,  which satisfied the unselfish woman, and demanded neither trouble nor sacrifice  from the young man himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,  if the wealthy heiress were the poor companion, mother,&rdquo; Mr. Darrell said, presently,  working away with his brush as he spoke, &ldquo;your scheme would be charming. Eleanor  Vincent is a glorious girl; a little bit of a spitfire, I should think, quiet and  gentle as she is with us; but a splendid girl; just the sort of wife for an indolent  man; a wife who would rouse him out of his lethargy and drive him on to distinction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes,  Launcelot Darrell, who had never in his life resisted any temptation, or accepted  any guidance except that of his own wishes, was led by them now, and, instead of  devoting himself to the young heiress, chose to fall desperately in love with her  fair-haired companion. He fell in love with Eleanor Vane; desperately, after his  own fashion. I doubt if there was any great intensity in the young man&rsquo;s desperation,  for I do not believe that he was capable of any real depth of feeling. There was  a kind of hollow, tinselly fervour in his nature which took the place of true passion.  It may be that with him all emotions&mdash;love and remorse, penitence, pity, regret,  hate, anger, and revenge&mdash;were true and real so long as they lasted; but all these  sentiments were so short-lived, by reason of the fickleness of his mind, that it  was almost difficult to believe even in their temporary truth.</p>
<p>But  Eleanor Vane, being very young and inexperienced, had no power of analysing the  character of her lover. She only knew that he was handsome, accomplished, and clever;  that he loved her, and that it was very agreeable to be loved by him.</p>
<p>I do  not believe that she returned the young man&rsquo;s affection. She was like a child upon  the threshold of a new world: bewildered and dazzled by the glorious aspect of the  unknown region before her; beguiled and delighted by its beauty and novelty. All  the darker aspects of the great passion were unknown to her, and undreamed of by  her. She only knew that in the blank horizon that had so long bounded her life,  a new star had arisen&mdash;a bright and wonderful planet, which for a while displaced  the lurid light that had so long shone steadfastly across the darkness.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane yielded herself up to the brief holiday-time which generally comes once in  almost every woman&rsquo;s life, however desolate and joyless the rest of that life may  be. The holiday comes,&mdash;a fleeting summer of gladness and rejoicing. The earth lights  up under a new sun and moon; the flowers bloom into new colours and scatter new  perfumes on the sublimated atmosphere; the waters of the commonest rivers change  to melted sapphires, and blaze with the splendour of a million jewels in the sunshine.  The dull universe changes to fairyland; but, alas! the holiday-time is very short:  the children grow tired of paradise, or are summoned back to school; the sun and  moon collapse into commonplace luminaries, the flowers fade into every-day blossoms,  the river flows a gray stream under a November sky, and the dream is over.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell had been little more than a fortnight at Hazlewood, when he declared his  love for Miss Mason&rsquo;s companion. The young people had been a great deal together  in that fortnight; wandering in the grassy lanes about Hazlewood, and in the shadowy  woods round Tolldale Priory, or on breezy hills high above the lawyer&rsquo;s sheltered  mansion. In hope of an alliance between Launcelot and Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s ward, Mrs.  Darrell was obliged to submit to the necessity which threw her son very much into  the society of the companion as well as of the heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  will surely never be so foolish as to thwart my plan for his future,&rdquo; thought the  anxious mother. &ldquo;Surely, surely, he will consent to be guided by his own interests.  Gilbert Monckton must know that it is only likely an attachment may arise between  Launcelot and Laura. He would not leave the girl with me unless he were resigned  to such an event, and ready to give his consent to their marriage. My son is poor,  certainly; but the lawyer knows that he is likely to inherit a great fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While  the mother pondered thus over her son&rsquo;s chances of advancement, the young man took  life very easily; spending his mornings at his easel, but by no means over-exerting  himself, and dawdling away his afternoons in rustic rambles with the two girls.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason was very happy in the society of this new and brilliant companion. She was  bewitched and fascinated by Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s careless talk, which sounded very witty,  very profound, sarcastic, and eloquent in the ears of an ignorant girl. She admired  him and fell in love with him, and wearied poor Eleanor with her very unreserved  rhapsodies about the object of her affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  it&rsquo;s very bold and wicked and horrid to fall in love with anybody before they fall  in love with one, you know, Eleanor,&rdquo; the young lady said in not very elegant English;  &ldquo;but he is so handsome and so clever. I don&rsquo;t think any one in the world could help  loving him.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I have no hope in  loving thee,&#8288;<br>
  &#8288;I only ask to  love;<br>
  I <i>ber</i>-rood upon my silent heart,<br>
&#8288;As on its nest  a dove;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>added  Miss Mason, quoting that favourite poet of all desponding lovers, poor L. E. L.</p>
<p>I think  Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s ward rather enjoyed the hopelessness of her attachment. The brooding  upon her silent heart was scarcely an accurate exposition of her conduct, as she  talked reams of sentiment to Eleanor upon the subject of her unrequited affection.  Miss Vane was patient and tender with her, listening to her foolish talk, and dreading  the coming of that hour in which the childish young beauty must be rudely awakened  from her rose-coloured dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  want to marry him, you know, Eleanor,&rdquo; the young lady said; &ldquo;I only want to be allowed  to love him. You remember the German story in which the Knight watches the window  of his lost love&rsquo;s convent cell. I could live for ever and ever near him; and be  content to see him sometimes; or to hear his voice, even if I did not see him. I  should like to wear boy&rsquo;s clothes, and be his page, like Viola, and tell him my  own story, you know, some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  remembered her promise to Gilbert Monckton, and tried sometimes to check the torrent  of sentimental talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  your love is very poetical, and I dare say it&rsquo;s very true, my pet,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but  do you think Mr. Darrell is quite worth all this waste of affection? I sometimes  think, Laura dear, that we commit a sin when we waste our best feelings. Suppose  by-and-bye you should meet some one quite as worthy of your love as Launcelot Darrell;  some one who would love you very devotedly; don&rsquo;t you think you would look back  and regret having lavished your best and freshest feelings upon a person who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  doesn&rsquo;t care a straw for me,&rdquo; cried the heiress, half crying. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you mean,  Eleanor Vincent. You mean to insinuate that Launcelot doesn&rsquo;t care for me. You are  a cruel, heartless girl, and you don&rsquo;t love me a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  the young lady bemoaned her disappointment, and wept over the hardships of her lot,  very much as she might have cried for any new plaything a few years before.</p>
<p>It was  upon a burning August morning that Launcelot Darrell declared himself to Eleanor  Vane. The two girls had been sitting to him for a picture,&mdash;Eleanor as Rosalind,  and Laura as Celia,&mdash;a pretty feminine group. Rosalind in her womanly robes, and  not her forester&rsquo;s dress of grey and green; for the painter had chosen the scene  in which Celia promises to share her cousin&rsquo;s exile.</p>
<p>This  picture was to be exhibited at the Academy, and was to make Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s fortune.  Laura had been called from the room to attend to some important business with a  dressmaker from Windsor,  and Eleanor and Launcelot were alone.</p>
<p>The  young man went on painting for some time, and then, throwing down his brush with  a gesture of impatience, went over to the window near which Eleanor sat on a raised  platform covered with a shabby drapery of red baize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you think the picture will be a success, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I think so, and hope so; but I am no judge, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  judgment must be as good as the public judgment, I should think,&rdquo; Launcelot Darrell  answered, rather impatiently. &ldquo;The critics will try to write me down, I dare say,  but I don&rsquo;t look to the critics to buy my picture. They&rsquo;ll call me crude and meretricious,  and hard and cold, and thin and grey, I&rsquo;ve no doubt; but the best picture, to my  mind, is the picture that sells best, eh, Miss Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  lifted her arched eyebrows with a look of surprise; this very low view of the question  rather jarred upon her sense of the dignity of art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose  you think my sentiments very mercenary and contemptible, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; said the  painter, interpreting the expression of her face; &ldquo;but I have lived out the romance  of my life, or one part of that romance, at any rate, and have no very ardent aspiration  after greatness in the abstract. I want to earn money. The need of money drives  men into almost every folly; further, sometimes: into follies that touch upon the  verge of crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man&rsquo;s face darkened suddenly as he spoke, and he was silent for a few moments,  not looking at his companion, but away out of the open window into vacancy, as it  seemed.</p>
<p>The  memory of Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s words flashed back upon Eleanor&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;There is a  secret in Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; the lawyer had said; &ldquo;a secret connected with  his Indian experience.&rdquo; Was he thinking of that secret now, Eleanor wondered. But  the painter&rsquo;s face brightened almost as suddenly as it had been overshadowed. He  flung back his head with an impetuous gesture. It seemed almost as if he had cast  some imaginary burden from off his shoulders by the same sudden movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want  to earn money, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Art in the abstract is very grand, no doubt.  I quite believe in the man who stabbed his model in order to get the death agony  for his picture of the Crucifixion; but I must make art subservient to my own necessities.  I must earn money for myself and my wife, Eleanor. I might marry a rich woman, perhaps,  but I want to marry a poor one. Do you think the girl I love will listen to me,  Eleanor? Do you think she will accept the doubtful future I can offer her? Do you  think she will be brave enough to share the fortunes of a struggling man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing  could be more heroic than the tone in which Launcelot Darrell spoke. He had the  air of a man who means to strive, with the sturdy devotion of a martyr, to win the  end of his ambition, rather than that of a sanguine but vacillating young gentleman  who would be ready to fling himself down under the influence of the first moment  of despondency, and live upon the proceeds of the pawning of his watch, while his  unfinished picture rotted upon the canvas.</p>
<p>He had  something of George Vane&rsquo;s nature, perhaps; that fatally hopeful temperament common  to men who are for ever going to do great things, and for ever failing to achieve  even the smallest. He was one of those men who are perpetually deluding other people  by the force of their power of self-delusion.</p>
<p>Self-deluded  and mistaken now, it was scarcely strange if he deceived Eleanor Vane, who was carried  away by the impetuous torrent of words in which he told her that he loved her, and  that the future happiness of his life depended upon the fiat which must issue from  her lips.</p>
<p>Only  very faltering accents came from those tremulous lips. Miss Vane was not in love;  she was bewildered, and perhaps a little bewitched by the painter&rsquo;s vehemence. He  was the first young, elegant, handsome, and accomplished man with whom she had ever  been thrown much in contact. It is scarcely wonderful, then, if this inexperienced  girl of eighteen was a little influenced by the ardour of his admiration&mdash;by the  eloquence of his wild talk.</p>
<p>She  had risen from her seat in her agitation, and stood with her back to the sunlit  window, trembling and blushing before her lover.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell was not slow to draw a flattering inference from these signs of womanly  confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  love me, Eleanor,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;yes, you love me. You think, perhaps, my mother would  oppose our marriage. You don&rsquo;t know me, dearest, if you can believe I would suffer  any opposition to come between me and my love. I am ready to make any sacrifice  for your sake, Eleanor. Only tell me that you love me, and I shall have a new purpose  in life; a new motive for exertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell held the girl&rsquo;s two hands clasped in both his own, as he pleaded thus, using  hackneyed phrases with a vehement earnestness that gave new life to the old words.  His face was close to Eleanor&rsquo;s, with the broad light of the sunny summer sky full  upon it. Some sudden fancy&mdash;some vague idea, dim and indistinct as the faint memory  of some dream whose details we strive vainly to recall&mdash;flashed into the mind of  George Vane&rsquo;s orphan daughter as she looked into her lover&rsquo;s black eyes. She recoiled  from him a little; her eyebrows contracted into a slight frown; her blushes faded  out with the effort which she made to seize upon and analyse that sudden fancy.  But her effort was vain: transient as a gleam of summer lightning the thought had  flashed across her brain, only to melt utterly away.</p>
<p>While  she was still trying to recall that last idea, while Launcelot Darrell was still  pleading for an answer to his suit, the door of the painting-room was pushed open&mdash;it  had been left ajar by volatile Miss Mason, most likely&mdash;and the widow entered, pale,  stern, and sorrowful-looking.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  Recognition</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Laura was with  you,&rdquo; Mrs. Darrell said, rather sharply, as she scrutinised Eleanor&rsquo;s face with  no very friendly eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  was with us until a few minutes ago,&rdquo; Launcelot answered carelessly; &ldquo;but she was  called away to see a milliner or a dressmaker, or some such important personage  in the feminine decorative art line. I don&rsquo;t believe that young lady&rsquo;s soul ever  soars above laces and ribbons, and all those miscellaneous fripperies which women  dignify by the generic title of their &lsquo;things&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell frowned darkly at her son&rsquo;s contemptuous allusion to the heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura  Mason is a very amiable and accomplished girl,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The  young man shrugged his shoulders, and took up his palette and brushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you settle yourself once more in the Rosalind attitude, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I suppose our volatile Celia will be back presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you go and look for her, Launcelot?&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Darrell, &ldquo;I want to speak to  Miss Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell flung down his brushes and turned suddenly towards his mother with a look  of angry defiance in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  have you to say to Miss Vincent that you can&rsquo;t say before me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What do  you mean, mother, by breaking in upon us like this, and scowling at us as if we  were a couple of conspirators?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell drew herself to her fullest height, and looked half sternly, half contemptuously  at her son. His nature, in every quality weaker and meaner than her own, prompted  him to shrink from any open contest with her. Dearly as she loved this selfish,  handsome scapegrace, there were times in which her better sense revolted against  the weakness of her affection; and at such times Launcelot Darrell was frightened  of his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  a great deal to say to Miss Vincent,&rdquo; the widow answered, gravely. &ldquo;If you refuse  to leave us together, I have no doubt Miss Vincent will have the good taste to come  elsewhere with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked up startled and bewildered by the suppressed passion in the widow&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  come with you anywhere, Mrs. Darrell,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you wish to speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  this way, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell swept out of the room, and Eleanor followed her, before the young man had  any opportunity for remonstrance. The widow led the way to the pretty chamber in  which Miss Vane slept, and the two women went in together, Mrs. Darrell shutting  the door behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Vincent,&rdquo; she said, taking Eleanor&rsquo;s hand in her own, &ldquo;I am going to appeal to you  more frankly than one woman often appeals to another. I might diplomatise and plot  against you, but I am not base enough for that; though, I dare say, I could stoop  to a good deal that is despicable for the sake of my son. And, again, I have so  good an opinion of you that I think candour will be the wisest policy. My son has  asked you to be his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;  stammered Eleanor, looking aghast at the pale face which had an almost tragic aspect  in its earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I told you just now that I could do despicable things for my son&rsquo;s sake. I was passing  the door while Launcelot was talking to you. The door was ajar, you know. I heard  a few words, enough to tell me the subject upon which he was speaking; and I stopped  to hear more. I listened, Miss Vincent. It was very contemptible, was it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  was silent. She stood before the widow looking down upon the ground. The colour  came and went in her face; she was agitated and confused by what had happened; but  in all her agitation and confusion the memory of that sudden fancy that had flashed  across her brain while Launcelot Darrell talked to her was uppermost in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  despise me for my conduct, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; said Mrs. Darrell, reading the meaning  of the girl&rsquo;s silence; &ldquo;but the day may come in which you may experience a mother&rsquo;s  anguish; the brooding care, the unceasing watchfulness, the feverish, all-devouring  anxiety which only a mother can feel. If that day ever comes, you will be able to  forgive me; to think mercifully of me. I do not complain of my son; I never have  complained of him. But I suffer, I suffer. I see him holding no place in the world,  despised by prosperous and successful men, with a wasted youth behind him and a  blank future before. I love him, but I am not deceived in him. The day for all deception  is past. He will never be rich or prosperous by any act of his own. There are but  two chances for him: the chance of inheriting my uncle&rsquo;s fortune, or the chance  of marrying a rich woman. I speak very frankly, you see, Miss Vincent, and I expect  equal candour from you. Do you love my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam&mdash;Mrs.  Darrell&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  would not answer him just now; I ask you to answer me. The prosperity of his future  life hangs upon your reply. I know that he <i>might</i> marry a girl who does love  him, and who can bring him a fortune which will place him in the position he ought  to occupy. Be generous, Miss Vincent. I ask you to tell me the truth. That is the  least you can do. Do you love my son, Launcelot Darrell? Do you love him with your  whole heart and soul, as I love him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  lifted her head suddenly, and looked full in the widow&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  madam,&rdquo; she answered, proudly, &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  God for that! Even if you had loved him, I would not have shrunk from asking you  to sacrifice yourself for his happiness. As it is, I appeal to you without hesitation.  Will you leave this place; will you leave me my son, with the chance of planning  his future after my own fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,  Mrs. Darrell,&rdquo; Eleanor said, earnestly. &ldquo;I thought, perhaps, till to-day&mdash;I may have  fancied that I&mdash;I mean that I was flattered by your son&rsquo;s attention, and perhaps  believed I&mdash;I loved him a little,&rdquo; the girl murmured shyly; &ldquo;but I know now that  I have been mistaken. Perhaps it is the truth and intensity of your love that shows  me the shallowness and falsehood of my own. I remember how I loved my father,&rdquo;&mdash;her  eyes filled with tears as she spoke,&mdash;&ldquo;and, looking back at my feelings for him,  I know that I do not love Mr. Darrell. It will be much better for me to go away. I  shall be sorry to leave Laura; sorry to leave Hazlewood, for I have been very happy  here&mdash;too happy, perhaps. I will write to your son, and tell him that I leave this  place of my own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  you, my dear,&rdquo; the widow said, warmly; &ldquo;my son would be very hard with me if he  thought that my influence had been the means of thwarting any whim of his. I know  him well enough to know that this sentiment, like every other sentiment of his,  will not endure for ever. He will be angry and offended, and wounded by your departure,  but he will not break his heart, Miss Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  me go away at once, Mrs. Darrell,&rdquo; said Eleanor; &ldquo;it will be better for me to go  at once. I can return to my friends in London.  I have saved some money while I have been with you, and I shall not go back to them  penniless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are a generous and noble-hearted girl. It shall be my care to provide you with at  least as good a home as you have had here. I am not selfish enough to forget how  much I have asked of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you will let me go at once. I would rather not see Laura, or say good-by to her.  We have grown so fond of each other. I never had a sister&mdash;that is to say, never  a&mdash;and Laura has been like one to me. Let me go away quietly without seeing her,  Mrs. Darrell. I can write to her from London  to say good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  shall do just as you like, my dear,&rdquo; the widow answered. &ldquo;I will drive you over  to Windsor in time  for the four-o&rsquo;clock train, and you will get into town before dark. I must go now  and see what my son is doing. If he should suspect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  shall suspect nothing till I am gone,&rdquo; said Eleanor. &ldquo;It is past one o&rsquo;clock now,  Mrs. Darrell, and I must pack all my things. Will you keep Laura out of my room,  please, for if she came here, she&rsquo;d guess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, I&rsquo;ll go and see&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make all arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell hurried out of the room, leaving Eleanor to contemplate the sudden change  in her position. The girl dragged one of her trunks out of a recess in the simply-furnished  bedchamber, and, sitting down upon it in a half-despondent attitude, reflected on  the unlooked-for break in her existence. Once more she was called upon to disunite  herself from the past, and begin life anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am  I never to know any rest?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I had grown so accustomed to this place.  I shall be glad to see the Signora and Richard once more; but Laura, Mr. Monckton,&mdash;I  wonder whether they will be sorry for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By three  o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, all Eleanor&rsquo;s preparations were completed. Her trunks  packed, and handed over to the factotum of the Hazlewood establishment, who was  to see them safely despatched by luggage train after the young lady&rsquo;s departure.  At three o&rsquo;clock precisely Miss Vincent took her seat beside Mrs. Darrell in the  low basket carriage.</p>
<p>Circumstances  had conspired to favour the girl&rsquo;s unnoticed departure from Hazlewood. Laura Mason  had been prostrated by the intense strain upon her faculties caused by an hour&rsquo;s  interview with her dressmaker, and had flung herself upon the sofa in the drawing-room  after sopping up half a pint of eau-de-Cologne on her flimsy handkerchief. Worn  out by her exertions, and lulled by the summer heat, the young lady had fallen into  a heavy slumber of two or three hours&rsquo; duration.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell had left the house almost immediately after the scene in the painting-room,  striding out of the hall without leaving any intimation as to the direction in which  he was going, or the probable hour of his return.</p>
<p>Thus  it was that the little pony-carriage drove quietly away from the gates of Hazlewood,  and Eleanor left the house in which she had lived for upwards of a year without  any one caring to question her as to the cause of her departure.</p>
<p>Very  few words were said by either Mrs. Darrell or her companion during the drive to  Windsor. Eleanor  was absorbed in gloomy thought. She did not feel any intense grief at leaving Hazlewood;  but some sense of desolation, some despondency at the thought that she was a wanderer  on the face of the earth, with no real claim upon any one, no actual right to rest  anywhere. They drove into Windsor  while she was thinking thus. They had come through the park, and they entered the  town by the gateway at the bottom of the hill. They had driven up the hill and were  in the principal street below the castle wall, when Mrs. Darrell uttered an exclamation  of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot!&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;and we must pass him to get to the station. There&rsquo;s no help for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked up. Yes, before the door of one of the principal hotels stood Mr. Launcelot  Darrell, with two other young men. One of these men was talking to him, but he was  paying very little attention. He stood upon the edge of the curbstone, with his  back turned to his companion, kicking the pebbles on the road with the toe of his  boot, and staring moodily before him.</p>
<p>In that  one moment,&mdash;in the moment in which the pony-carriage, going at full speed, passed  the young man,&mdash;the thought which had flashed, so vague and indistinct, so transient  and intangible, through the mind of Eleanor Vane that morning, took a new shape,  and arose palpable and vivid in her brain.</p>
<p>This  man, Launcelot Darrell, was the sulky stranger, who had stood on the Parisian Boulevard,  kicking the straws upon the curbstone, and waiting to entrap her father to his ruin.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  On The Track</strong></h2>
<p>The little pony-carriage drove on to the station; and Eleanor,  like some traveller in a dream, saw the castle walls and turrets, the busy street  and hurrying people spin past her eyes, and melt into confusion. She did not know  how she entered the railway station, or how she came to be walking quietly up and  down the platform with Mrs. Darrell. There was a choking sensation in her dry throat,  a blinding mist before her eyes, and a confusion that was almost terrible to bear  in her brain. She wanted to get away; anywhere, so long as it was away from all  the world. In the meantime, she walked up and down the platform with Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  mother by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  mad,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I am mad. It <em>cannot</em> be so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again  and again in the course of Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s brief association with the widow&rsquo;s son,  something, some fancy, some shadowy recollection, vague and impalpable as the faintest  clouds in the summer sky above Hazlewood, had flashed across her mind, only to be  blotted away before she could even try to define or understand it. But now these  passing fancies all culminated in one conviction; Launcelot Darrell was the man  whom she had seen lounging on the kerbstone of the Boulevard on the night of her  last parting with her father.</p>
<p>In vain  she reasoned with herself that she had no justifiable grounds for this conviction&mdash;the  conviction remained, nevertheless. The only foundation for her belief that Launcelot  Darrell, from amongst all other men, was the one man whom she sought to pursue,  was a resemblance in his attitude as he stood lounging in the Windsor street, to  the attitude of the young man on the Boulevard. Surely this was the slightest, the  weakest foundation on which belief ever rested. Eleanor Vane could acknowledge this;  but she could not lessen the force of that belief. At the very moment when the memory  of her father, and her father&rsquo;s death, had been furthest from her thoughts, this  sudden conviction, rapid and forcible as inspiration, had flashed upon her.</p>
<p>The  matter was beyond reason, beyond argument.</p>
<p>The  young man loitering listlessly upon the kerbstone of the Windsor street, was the man who had loitered on  the Boulevard; waiting, sulkily enough, while his companion tempted George Vane  to his destruction.</p>
<p>It seemed  as if the girl&rsquo;s memory, suddenly endowed with a new and subtle power, took her  back to that August night in the year &rsquo;53, and placed her once more face to face  with her father&rsquo;s enemy. Once more the dark, restless eyes, the pale, cowering face,  and moustachioed lip, overshadowed by the slouched hat, flashed upon her for a moment,  before the sulky stranger turned away to keep moody silence throughout his companion&rsquo;s  babble. And with that memory of the past, was interlinked the face and figure of  Launcelot Darrell; so closely, that do what she would, Eleanor Vane could not disassociate  the two images.</p>
<p>And  she had suffered this man, of all other men, to tell her that he loved her; she  had taken a romantic pleasure in his devotion; day after day, and hour after hour,  she had been his companion; sharing his enjoyments, sympathising with his pursuits,  admiring and believing him. This day&mdash;this very day&mdash;he had held her hand, he had  looked in her face, and the words she had spoken to Richard Thornton had proved  only a vain boast, after all. No instinct in her own heart had revealed to her the  presence of her father&rsquo;s murderer.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell looked furtively every now and then at the girl&rsquo;s face. The iron rigidity  of that white face almost startled the widow. Was it the expression of terrible  grief restrained by a superhuman effort of will?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does  this girl love my son, I wonder?&rdquo; the widow thought; and then the answer, prompted  by a mother&rsquo;s pride, came quickly after the question. &ldquo;Yes, how could she do otherwise  than love him? How could any woman on earth be indifferent to my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something,  almost akin to pity, stirred faintly in the heart which was so cold to every creature  upon earth, except this spoiled and prodigal son; and Mrs. Darrell did her best  to comfort the banished girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  afraid you are ill, my dear Miss Vincent,&rdquo; the widow said. &ldquo;The excitement of this  sudden departure has been too much for you. Pray, my dear, do not think that I submit  to this necessity without very great regret. You have given me perfect satisfaction  in everything you have done, ever since you entered my house. No praises I can bestow  upon you in recommending you to a new home will go beyond the truth. Forgive me,  forgive me, my poor child; I know I must seem very cruel; but I love my son so dearly&mdash;I  love him so dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was real feeling in the tone in which these words were spoken; but the widow&rsquo;s voice  sounded far away to Eleanor Vane, and the words had no meaning. The girl turned  her stony face towards the speaker, and made a feeble effort to understand what  was said to her; but all power of comprehension seemed lost in the bewilderment  of her brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want  to get back to London,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;I want to get away from this place. Will it be long before the train  starts, Mrs. Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  five minutes. I have put up your money in this envelope, my dear, a quarter&rsquo;s salary,  the quarter began in June, you know, and I have paid you up to September. I have  paid for your ticket, also, in order that your money might not be broken into by  that expense. Your luggage will be sent to you to-morrow. You will get a cab at  the station, my dear. Your friends will be very much surprised to see you, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  friends!&rdquo; repeated Eleanor, in an absent tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  the good music-mistress and her son. I have your address, Miss Vincent, and you  may rely on hearing from me in a few days. I shall take care that you suffer no  inconvenience from this sudden change in all our plans. Good-bye, and God bless  you, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  had taken her seat in the carriage by this time, and the train was about to move.  Mrs. Darrell held out her hand; but the girl drew away from her with a sudden movement  of terror. &ldquo;Oh, please do not shake hands with me!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am very, very  unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  train moved away before the widow could reply to this strange speech, and the last  thing that Eleanor saw, was the pale face of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s mother turned towards  her with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor  child,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Darrell, as she walked slowly back to the station-door, before  which her pony-carriage waited. &ldquo;She feels this very much, but she has acted nobly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  widow sighed as she remembered that the worst part of the struggle was yet to come.  She would have her son&rsquo;s indignation to encounter and to endure; not the stormy  passion of a strong man, unfairly separated from the woman he loves; but the fretful  irritation of a spoiled child who has been robbed of a favourite toy.</p>
<p>It was  nearly dark when Eleanor Vane reached the Pilasters. She paid and dismissed the  cab in Dudley Street,  and made her way on foot under the familiar archway, and into the Colonnade, where  the same children seemed to be playing the same games in the dusky light, the same  horses peering from the stable-doors, the same cabmen drinking at the oldfashioned  public-house at the corner.</p>
<p>The  Signora was giving a singing-lesson to a stolid young person with a fat face and  freckles, who was being prepared for the lyric drama, and wished to appear at one  of the opera houses as Norma, after a dozen lessons or so. Eliza Picirillo was trying  her hardest to simplify a difficult passage for this embryo Grisi&rsquo;s comprehension,  when Eleanor Vane opened the door of the little sitting-room, and appeared upon  the threshold.</p>
<p>It would  have been natural to the girl to have rushed to the piano and flung herself into  the arms of the Signora at the risk of upsetting the stolid pupil; and there was  something so very unnatural in her manner as she paused in the open doorway,&mdash;something  so wan and ghost-like in her appearance, that Eliza Picirillo rose in alarm from  her music-stool and stared aghast at this unexpected visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo;  she exclaimed, &ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear Signora, it is I! I&mdash;I know I have come back very unexpectedly; I have a great  deal to tell you by-and-by. But I am tired to death. May I sit down, please, while  you finish your lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>May</em> you sit down! My darling Nelly, is that the way you talk in your old home. My dear,  dear child, do you think you can ever come so unexpectedly as to fail to find a  welcome from Eliza Picirillo. Here, my dear, sit down and make yourself as comfortable  as you can, until I&rsquo;m able to attend to you. Excuse me, Miss Dodson, we&rsquo;ll go on  with the duet directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  music-mistress wheeled forward an old easy-chair, her own favourite seat, and Eleanor  dropped wearily into it. Signora Picirillo removed the girl&rsquo;s bonnet, and tenderly  smoothed her tumbled hair, murmuring expressions of welcome and affection, and whispering  a promise that the lesson should be very soon finished.</p>
<p>She  went back to Norma after seeing Eleanor comfortably ensconced in the arm-chair,  and hammered away sturdily and conscientiously at the &ldquo;<em>Deh, Conte</em>&rdquo; duet,  in which Miss Dodson gave a very mild interpretation of the Italian composer&rsquo;s meaning,  and sang about Pollio, her children, and her wrongs as placidly as if she had been  declaiming her wish to be a butterfly, or any other sentiment common to English  ballad-singers.</p>
<p>But  when Miss Dodson had finished singing, and had put on her bonnet and shawl, which  operation occupied a good deal of unnecessary time, and had rolled up her music,  and found her gloves, which had fallen off the piano and hidden themselves in an  obscure and dusty corner of the room, and had further entered into a detailed and  intricate explanation of her engagements and domestic circumstances, before making  an appointment for the next lesson, and had been finally hustled out of the room  and lighted down the stairs, and fully instructed as to the nearest way from the  Pilasters to Camden Town, Eliza Picirillo was able to give her full attention to  the pale-faced girl who had returned so suddenly to her old shelter. The music-mistress  was almost frightened at the expression of Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s face. She remembered only  too well having seen that look before, upon the September night in Paris; when the girl of fifteen  had sworn to be revenged upon her father&rsquo;s enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nelly,  my darling,&rdquo; she said, seating herself beside Eleanor&rsquo;s chair, &ldquo;how is it that you  come home so suddenly? Nothing could be greater happiness than to have you back,  my dear. But I know that something has happened; I can see it in your face, Nelly.  Tell me, my dear, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is nothing to be sorry about, dear Signora; I have come away because&mdash;because Mrs.  Darrell wished it. Her son&mdash;her only son has come home from India, and she wants him to marry a  rich woman, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  he has fallen in love with <em>you</em>, eh, Nelly?&rdquo; asked the Signora. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m  not surprised to hear that, my dear; and you are honourable enough to beat a retreat,  and leave the young man free to make a mercenary marriage at his mother&rsquo;s bidding.  Dear, dear, what strange things people are ready to do for money now-a-days. I&rsquo;m  sure you&rsquo;ve acted very wisely, my darling; so cheer up, and let me see the bright  smile that we&rsquo;ve been accustomed to. There&rsquo;s nothing in all this to make you look  so pale, Nelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  I look pale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  as pale as a ghost weary with a long night&rsquo;s wandering. Nelly, dear,&rdquo; said the Signora,  very gently, &ldquo;you weren&rsquo;t in love with this young man; you didn&rsquo;t return his affection,  did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  love with him!&rdquo; cried Eleanor Vane, with a shudder, &ldquo;oh! no, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  yet you seem sorry at having left Hazlewood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  sorry&mdash;I&mdash;I had many reasons for wishing to stay there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  were attached to your companion, Miss Mason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I was very much attached to her,&rdquo; answered Eleanor; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me any more questions  to-night, dear Signora. I&rsquo;m tired out with my journey and the excitement of&mdash;all&mdash;that  has happened to-day. I will explain things more fully to-morrow; I am glad to come  back to you&mdash;very, very glad to see you once more, dearest friend; but I had a strong  reason for wishing to stay at Hazlewood,&mdash;I have a powerful motive for wanting to  go back there, if I could go back&mdash;which I fear I never can.&rdquo; The girl stopped abruptly,  as if absorbed in her own thoughts, and almost unconscious of her friend&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  well, my dear, I won&rsquo;t question you any further,&rdquo; Eliza Picirillo said, soothingly.  &ldquo;Goodness knows, my dear, I am glad enough to have you with me, without worrying  you about the why and the wherefore. But I must go and try and get your little room  ready again for you, or perhaps, as it&rsquo;s late, you&rsquo;d better sleep with me to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you please, dear Signora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  music-mistress hurried away to make some preparations in the bed-chamber adjoining  the little sitting-room, and Eleanor Vane sat staring at the guttering tallow candles  on the table before her, lost in the tumult and confusion of thoughts which as yet  took no distinct form in her brain.</p>
<p>At the  very moment in which she had set a barrier between herself and Hazlewood, that might  prevent her ever crossing the threshold of its gates, she had made a discovery which  rendered that retired country dwelling-house the one spot upon earth to which she  had need to have free access.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancied  that I was going away from my revenge when I left London  to go into Berkshire,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;now I leave  my revenge behind me at Hazlewood. And yet how can it be as I think? How can it  be so? Launcelot Darrell went to India a year before my father died.  Can it be only a likeness after all&mdash;an accidental likeness between <em>that man</em> and Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  sat thinking of these things&mdash;reasoning with herself upon the utter improbability  of the identity of the two men, yet yielding again and again to that conviction  which had forced itself upon her, sudden and irresistible, in the Windsor Street,&mdash;while  the Signora bustled about between the two rooms, stopping to cast a stolen glance  now and then at Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s thoughtful face.</p>
<p>Mr.  Richard Thornton came in by-and-by. The Ph&oelig;nix was closed as to dramatic performances,  but the scene-painter&rsquo;s work never stopped. The young man gave utterance to a cry  of delight as he saw the figure sitting in his aunt&rsquo;s easy-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nell!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, &ldquo;has the world come to an end, and have you dropped into your proper  position in the general smash! Eleanor, how glad I am to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held  out both his hands. Miss Vane rose and mechanically put her white fingers in the  weather-beaten looking palms held out to receive them.</p>
<p>In that  moment the scene-painter saw that something had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter, Nell?&rdquo; he cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,  Dick,&rdquo; said the girl, in a whisper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the Signora to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t want the Signora to know what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  found that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  man who caused my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  In The Shipbroker&rsquo;s Office</strong></h2>
<p>Eleanor Vane employed the morning after her arrival at the Pilasters  in writing to Laura Mason. She would have written a long letter if she could, for  she knew what grief her sudden departure must have caused her childish and confiding  companion; but she could not write of anything except the one thought that absorbed  her whole brain, leaving her for the common business of life a purposeless and powerless  creature. The explanation which she gave of her sudden departure was lame and laboured;  her expressions of regard were trite and meaningless. It was only when she came  to that subject which was the real purpose of her letter; it was only when she came  to write of Launcelot Darrell, that there was any vigour or reality in her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  a favour to ask you, dear Laura,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;and I must beg you to use your best  discretion in granting it. I want you to find out for me the date of Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s  departure for Calcutta,  and the name of the vessel in which he sailed. Do this, Laura, and you will be serving  me; perhaps serving him also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I find that he really was in India  at the date of my father&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; Eleanor thought, &ldquo;I <em>must</em> cease to suspect  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later  in the day, Miss Vane went out with Richard into the streets and squares in which  all their secret conferences had taken place. She told the scene-painter very simply  and briefly of what had happened, and poor Dick listened to her story with a tender  respect, as he would have listened to anything from her. But he shook his head with  a sad smile when she had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you think now, Richard?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  that you are the dupe of a foolish fancy, Nelly,&rdquo; the young man answered. &ldquo;You are  deceived by some chance resemblance between this Mr. Darrell and the man you saw  upon the Boulevard. Any dark pale-faced man lounging moodily on a kerbstone would  have reminded you of the figure which is so interwoven with the memories of that  mournful time in Paris.  Forget it, Nelly, my dear; forget that dark chapter in the history of your girlhood.  Your father&rsquo;s rest will be none the sweeter because the brightness of your youth  is blighted by these bitter memories. Do your duty, Eleanor, in the state to which  you are called. You are not called upon to sacrifice the fairest years of your life  to a Quixotic scheme of vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quixotic!&rdquo;  cried Eleanor, reproachfully, &ldquo;you would not speak like this, Richard, if <em>your</em> father had suffered as my father suffered through the villany of a gambler and cheat.  It is no use talking to me, Dick,&rdquo; she added, resolutely, &ldquo;if this conviction which  I cannot get out of my mind is a false one, it&rsquo;s falsehood must be proved; if it  is true&mdash;why then it will seem to me as if Providence had flung this man across my  pathway, and that I am appointed to bring punishment upon him for his wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  Eleanor; but this Mr. Darrell is <em>not</em> the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you know he is not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,  according to your own account, Launcelot was in India in the year &rsquo;53.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  they <em>say</em> that he was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you any reason to doubt the fact?&rdquo; asked Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Eleanor, &ldquo;when Mr. Darrell first returned to Hazlewood, Laura Mason was  very anxious to hear all about what she called his &lsquo;adventures&rsquo; in India.  She asked him a great many questions, and I remember&mdash;I cannot tell you, Dick, how  carelessly I listened at the time, though every word comes back to me now as vividly  as if I had been a prisoner on trial for my life, listening breathlessly to the  evidence of the witnesses against me&mdash;I remember now how obstinately Launcelot Darrell  avoided all Laura&rsquo;s questions, telling her at last, almost rudely, to change the  subject. The next day Mr. Monckton came to us, and he talked about India,  and Mr. Darrell again avoided the question in the same sullen, disagreeable manner.  You may think me weak and foolish, Richard, and I dare say I am so, but Mr. Monckton  is a very clever man. <em>He</em> could not be easily deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  what of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  said, &lsquo;Launcelot Darrell has a secret, and that secret is connected with his Indian  experiences.&rsquo; I thought very little of this at the time, Dick; but I think I understand  it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,  and the young man&rsquo;s secret&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  that he never went to India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Richard, I think and believe this, and you must help me to find out whether I am  right or wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  scene-painter sighed. He had hoped that his beautiful adopted sister had long since  abandoned or forgotten her Utopian scheme of vengeance, in the congenial society  of a gay-hearted girl of her own age; and, behold, here she was, vindictive, resolute,  as upon that Sunday evening, a year and a half ago, on which they had walked together  in those dingy London streets.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane interrupted her companion&rsquo;s sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember  your promise, Richard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You promised to serve me, and you must do so&mdash;you <em>will</em> do so, won&rsquo;t you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  avenging fury had transformed herself into a siren as she spoke, and looked archly  up at her companion&rsquo;s face, with her head on one side, and a soft light in her grey  eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t refuse to serve me, will you, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refuse,&rdquo;  cried the young man. &ldquo;Oh, Nelly, Nelly, you know very well there is nothing in the  world I could refuse you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Vane accepted this assurance with great composure. She had never been able to disassociate  Richard Thornton with those early days in which she had accompanied him to Covent Garden to buy mulberry leaves for his silkworms, and  learned to play &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; upon the young musician&rsquo;s violin. Nothing was  further from her thoughts than the idea that poor Dick&rsquo;s feelings could have undergone  any change since those childish days in the King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea.</p>
<p>The  letter which Eleanor so feverishly awaited from Laura Mason came by return of post.  The young lady&rsquo;s epistle was very long, and rather rambling in its nature. Three  sheets of note-paper were covered with Miss Mason&rsquo;s lamentations for her friend&rsquo;s  absence, reproachful complainings against her friend&rsquo;s cruelty, and repeated entreaties  that Eleanor would come back to Hazlewood.</p>
<p>George  Vane&rsquo;s daughter did not linger over this feminine missive. A few days ago she would  have been touched by Laura&rsquo;s innocent expressions of regard; now her eyes hurried  along the lines, taking little note of all those simple words of affection and regret,  and looking greedily forward to that one only passage in the letter which was likely  to have any interest for her.</p>
<p>This  passage did not occur until Eleanor had reached the very last of the twelve pages  which Miss Mason had covered with flowing Italian characters, whose symmetry was  here and there disfigured by sundry blots and erasures. But as her eyes rested upon  the last page, Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s hand tightened upon the paper in her grasp, and the  hot blood rushed redly to her earnest face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  I have found out all you want to know, dear Nell,&rdquo; wrote Miss Mason, &ldquo;though I am  puzzled out of my wits to know why you should want to know it&mdash;when I did exercises  in composition at Bayswater, they wouldn&rsquo;t let me put two &lsquo;knows&rsquo; so near together;  but you won&rsquo;t mind it, will you, dear? Well, darling, I&rsquo;m not very clever at beating  about the bush or finding out anything in a diplomatic way; so this afternoon at  tea&mdash;I am writing to catch the evening post, and Bob is going to take my letter to  the village for sixpence&mdash;I asked Launcelot Darrell, who was not drinking his tea,  like a Christian, but lolling in the window smoking a cigar: he has been as sulky  as a bear ever since you left&mdash;oh, Nelly, Nelly, he isn&rsquo;t in love with you, is he?&mdash;I  should break my heart if I thought he was&mdash;I asked him, point blank, what year and  what day he sailed for India. I suppose the question sounded rather impertinent,  for he coloured up scarlet all in a minute, and shrugged his shoulders in that dear  disdainful way of his that always reminds me of Lara or the Corsair&mdash;L. and the C.  were the same person, though, weren&rsquo;t they&mdash;and said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t keep a diary, Miss  Mason, or I should be happy to afford you any information you may require as to  my antecedents.&rsquo; I thought I should have dropped through the floor, Nelly,&mdash;the floor  won&rsquo;t let one drop through it, or else I&rsquo;m sure I should,&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t have asked  another question, even for your sake, dear; when, strange to say, Mrs. Darrell got  me quite out of the difficulty. &lsquo;I am sorry you should answer Laura so very unkindly,  Launcelot,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;there is nothing strange in her question. <em>I</em> remember  the date of your departure from your native country only too vividly. You left this  house upon the 3rd of October, &rsquo;52, and you were to sail from Gravesend  on the 4th, in the Princess Alice. I have reason to remember the date, for it seemed  as if my uncle chose the very worst season of the year for sending you upon a long  sea voyage. But he was prompted, no doubt, by my sisters. I ought to feel no anger  against him, poor old man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane glanced hurriedly at the concluding words of the letter. Then, with the last  sheet crumpled in her hand, she sat motionless and absorbed, thinking over its contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  Launcelot Darrell sailed for India  upon the 4th of October, &rsquo;52, he is not likely to have been in Paris in &rsquo;53. If I can only prove to myself that  he did sail upon that date, I will try and believe that I have been deluded by some  foolish fancy of my own. But why did his face flush scarlet when Laura questioned  him about his voyage&mdash;why did he pretend to have forgotten the date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  waited impatiently for the arrival of her friend and counsellor, Richard Thornton.  He came in at about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, while his aunt was still absent  amongst her out-of-door pupils, and flung himself, jaded and worn out, on the chintz-covered  sofa. But, tired as he was, he aroused himself by an effort to listen to that portion  of Laura Mason&rsquo;s letter which related to Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you think now, Dick?&rdquo; Miss Vane asked, when she had finished reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty  much what I thought before, Nell,&rdquo; answered Mr. Thornton; &ldquo;this young fellow&rsquo;s objection  to talk of his Indian voyage is no proof that he never went upon that voyage. He  may have half-a-dozen unpleasant recollections connected with that part of his life.  I don&rsquo;t particularly care about talking of the Ph&oelig;nix; but I never committed a murder  in the obscurity of the flies, or buried the body of my victim between the stage  and the mezzanine floor. People have their secrets, Nell, and we have no right to  pry into the small mysteries which may lurk under a change of countenance or an  impatient word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane took very little notice of the young man&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can  you find out if Launcelot Darrell sailed in the Princess Alice, Dick?&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>The  scene-painter rubbed his chin, reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can <em>try</em> and find out, my dear,&rdquo; he said, after a pause; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s open to anybody.  The Princess Alice! She&rsquo;s one of Ward&rsquo;s ships, I think. If the shipbrokers are inclined  to be civil, they&rsquo;ll perhaps help me; but I have no justification for bothering  them upon the subject, and they <em>may</em> tell me to go about my business. If I  could give them a good reason for my making such an inquiry, I might very likely  find them willing to help me. But what can I tell them, except that a very beautiful  young person with grey eyes and auburn hair has taken an absurd crotchet into her  obstinate head, and that I, her faithful slave, am compelled to do her bidding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind what they say to you, Richard,&rdquo; Miss Vane replied, authoritatively, &ldquo;they <em>must</em> answer your question, if you only go on asking them long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Thornton smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the true feminine method of obtaining information, isn&rsquo;t it, Nell?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;however,  I&rsquo;ll do my best, and if the shipbrokers are to be &lsquo;got at,&rsquo; as sporting gentlemen  say, it shall go hard if I don&rsquo;t get a list of the passengers who sailed in the  Princess Alice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,  dear Dick!&rdquo; cried Eleanor, holding out her hands to her young champion. The young  man sighed. Alas, he knew only too well that all this pretty friendliness was as  far away from any latent tenderness or hidden emotion as the bold blusterous North  from the splendid sunny South.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder  whether she knows what love is,&rdquo; thought the scene-painter; &ldquo;I wonder whether her  heart has been touched ever so slightly by the fatal emotion. No; she is a bright  virginal creature, all confidence and candour, and she has yet to learn the mysteries  of life. I wish I could think less of her and fall in love with Miss Montalembert&mdash;her  name is plain Lambert, and she has added the Monta for the sake of euphony. I wish  I could fall in love with Lizzie Lambert, popularly known as Elise Montalembert,  the soubrette at the Ph&oelig;nix. She is a good little girl, and earns a salary of four  pounds a week. She&rsquo;s fond of the Signora, too, and we could leave the Pilasters  and go into housekeeping upon our joint salaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Thornton&rsquo;s fancies might have rambled on in this wise for some time, but he was  abruptly aroused from his reverie by Eleanor Vane, who had been watching him rather  impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  are you going to the shipbroker&rsquo;s, Dick?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  am I going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  you&rsquo;ll go at once, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh!  Well, my dear Nell, Cornhill&rsquo;s a good step from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you can take a cab,&rdquo; cried the young lady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve plenty of money, Dick, and do you  think I shall grudge it for such a purpose? Go at once Richard, dear, and take a  cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  pulled a purse from her pocket, and tried to force it into the young man&rsquo;s hand,  but he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid the shipbroker&rsquo;s office would be closed, Nelly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better wait  till to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the young lady would not hear of this. She was sure the shipbroker&rsquo;s office wouldn&rsquo;t  close so early, she said, with as much authority as if she had been intimately acquainted  with the habits of shipbrokers, and she bustled Dick down stairs and out of the  house before he well knew where he was.</p>
<p>He returned,  in about an hour and a half; very tired and dusty; having preferred his independence  and an omnibus, to the cab offered by Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  no use, Nelly,&rdquo; he said despondently, as he threw off his hat, and ran his dirty  fingers through the rumpled shock of dusty brown hair that had been blown about  his face by the hot August wind, &ldquo;the office was just closing, and I couldn&rsquo;t get  anything out of the clerks. I was never so cruelly snubbed in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Vane looked very much disappointed, and was silent for a minute or so. Then her  face suddenly brightened, and she patted Richard&rsquo;s shoulder with a gesture expressive  of patronage and encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind, Dick,&rdquo; she said smilingly, &ldquo;you shall go again to-morrow morning, early; and  I&rsquo;ll go with you. We&rsquo;ll see if these shipbroker&rsquo;s clerks will snub <em>me</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snub  you!&rdquo; cried Richard Thornton, in a rapture of admiration. &ldquo;I think that, of all  the members of the human family, paid officials are the most unpleasant and repulsive;  but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a clerk in Christendom who could snub you, Miss Vane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  smiled. Perhaps for the first time in her life the young lady was guilty of a spice  of that feminine sin called coquetry. Her boxes had arrived from Hazlewood upon  the previous evening. She was armed therefore with all those munitions of war without  which a woman can scarcely commence a siege upon the fortress of man&rsquo;s indifference.</p>
<p>She  rose early the next morning&mdash;for she was too much absorbed in the one great purpose  of her life to be able to sleep very long or very soundly&mdash;and arrayed herself for  her visit to the shipbroker.</p>
<p>She  put on a bonnet of pale blue crape, which was to be the chief instrument in the  siege&mdash;a feminine battering ram or Armstrong gun before which the stoutest wall must  have crumbled&mdash;and smoothed her silken locks, her soft amber-dropping tresses, under  this framework of diaphanous azure. Then she went into the little sitting-room where  Mr. Richard Thornton was loitering over his breakfast, to try the effect of this  piece of milliner&rsquo;s artillery upon the unhappy young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  the clerks snub me, Dick?&rdquo; she asked, archly.</p>
<p>The  scene-painter replied with his mouth full of egg and bread-and-butter, and was more  enthusiastic than intelligible.</p>
<p>A four-wheel  cab jolted Miss Vane and her companion to Cornhill, and the young lady contrived  to make her way into the sanctum sanctorum of the shipbroker himself, in a manner  which took Richard Thornton&rsquo;s breath away from him, in the fervour of his admiration.  Every barrier gave way before the blue bonnet and glistening auburn hair, the bright  grey eyes and friendly smile. Poor Dick had approached the officials with that air  of suppressed enmity and lurking hate with which the Englishman generally addresses  his brother Englishman; but Eleanor&rsquo;s friendliness and familiarity disarmed the  stoniest of the clerks, and she was conducted to the shipbroker&rsquo;s private room by  an usher who bowed before her as if she had been a queen.</p>
<p>The  young lady told her story very simply. She wished to ascertain if a gentleman called  Launcelot Darrell had sailed in the Princess Alice on the 4th of October, &rsquo;52.</p>
<p>This  was all she said. Richard Thornton stood by, fingering difficult passages in his  last overture on the brim of his hat, out of sheer perturbation of spirit, while  he wondered at and admired Miss Vane&rsquo;s placid assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall  be extremely obliged if you can give me this information,&rdquo; she said, in conclusion,  &ldquo;for a great deal depends upon my being able to ascertain the truth of this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  shipbroker looked through his spectacles at the earnest face turned so trustingly  towards his own. He was an old man, with granddaughters as tall as Eleanor, but  was nevertheless not utterly dead to the influence of a beautiful face. The auburn  hair and diaphanous bonnet made a bright spot of colour in the dinginess of his  dusty office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should  be very ungallant were I to refuse to serve a young lady,&rdquo; the old man said politely.  &ldquo;Jarvis,&rdquo; he added, turning to the clerk who had conducted Eleanor to his apartment,  &ldquo;do you think you could contrive to look up the list of passengers in the Princess  Alice, October 4, &rsquo;52?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Jarvis, who had told Richard to go about his business upon the day before, said  he had no doubt he could, and went away to perform this errand.</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  breath grew short and quick, and her colour rose as she waited for the clerk&rsquo;s return.  Richard executed impossible passages on the brim of his hat. The shipbroker watched  the girl&rsquo;s face, and drew his own deductions from the flutter of agitation visible  in that bright countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;  he thought, &ldquo;a love affair, no doubt. This pretty girl in the blue bonnet has come  here to look after a runaway sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  clerk returned, carrying a ledger, with his thumb between two of the leaves. He  opened the uninteresting-looking volume, and laid it on the table before his employer,  pointing with his spare forefinger to one particular entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A berth  was taken for a Mr. Launcelot Darrell, who was to share his cabin with a Mr. Thomas  Halliday,&rdquo; the shipbroker said, looking at the passage to which the clerk pointed.</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  face crimsoned. She had wronged the widow&rsquo;s son then after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the name was crossed out afterwards,&rdquo; continued the old man, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s another  entry further down, dated October 5th. The ship sailed without Mr. Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  crimson flush faded out of Eleanor&rsquo;s face and left it deadly pale. She tottered  forwards a few paces towards the table, with her hand stretched out, as if she would  have taken the book from the shipbroker and examined the entry for herself. But  midway between the chair she had left and the table, her strength failed her, and  she would have fallen if Richard Thornton had not dashed his hat upon the ground,  and caught her sinking figure in his outstretched arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear  me!&rdquo; exclaimed the shipbroker, &ldquo;bless my soul: a glass of water, Jarvis; this is  very sad, very sad, indeed. A runaway lover, I suppose, or a brother, perhaps. These  sort of things are always happening. I assure you, if I had the gift that some of  you young people have, I could write half a dozen romances out of the history of  this office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  clerk came back with the glass of water; it was rather a murky-looking fluid, but  a few drops between Eleanor&rsquo;s pale lips served to bring the life back to her.</p>
<p>She  lifted her head with the proud resolution of a queen, and looked at the compassionate  shipbroker with a strange smile. She had heard the old man&rsquo;s suppositions about  lovers and brothers. How far away his simple fancy led him from the bitter truth.</p>
<p>She  held out her hand to him as she rose from her chair, erect and dauntless as a fair-haired  Joan of Arc, ready to gird on the sword in defence of her king and country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank  you very much, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for what you have done for me to-day. My father  was an old man; as old or older perhaps than yourself; and he died a very cruel  death. I believe that your kindness of this day will help me to avenge him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  Resolved</strong></h2>
<p>Launcelot Darrell had not sailed for Calcutta in the Princess Alice. This point once  established, it was utterly vain for Richard Thornton to argue against that sudden  conviction, that indomitable belief which had taken possession of Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s  mind, respecting the identity between the man who had won her father&rsquo;s money at  &eacute;cart&eacute;, and Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s only son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell  you, Richard,&rdquo; she said, when the scene-painter argued with her, &ldquo;that nothing but  proof positive of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s absence in India  at the date of my father&rsquo;s death would have dispossessed me of the idea that flashed  upon me on the day I left Berkshire. He was not  in India  at that time. He deceived his mother and his friends. He remained in Europe; and led, no doubt, an idle, dissipated life. He must  have lived by his wits, for he had no money from his mother; no one to help him&mdash;no  profession to support him. What is more likely than that he went to Paris,&mdash;the paradise of scoundrels,  I have heard you say, Richard,&mdash;under an assumed name? What more likely? Why, <em>he  was there!</em> The man I saw on the Boulevard, and the man I saw in the Windsor Street, are  one and the same. You cannot argue me out of that settled idea, Richard Thornton,  for it is the truth. It is the truth, and it shall be the business of my life to  prove that it is so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what then, Eleanor?&rdquo; Mr. Thornton asked gravely. &ldquo;Supposing you can prove this;  by such evidences as will be very difficult to get at; by such an investigation  as will waste your life, blight your girlhood, warp your nature, unsex your mind,  and transform you from a candid and confiding woman into an amateur detective? Suppose  you do all this,&mdash;and you little guess, my dear, the humiliating falsehoods, the  pitiful deceptions, the studied basenesses, you must practise if you are to tread  that sinuous pathway,&mdash;what then? What good is effected; what end is gained? Are  you any nearer to the accomplishment of the vow you uttered in the Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean  that to prove this man&rsquo;s guilt is not to avenge your father&rsquo;s death. Neither you  nor the law have any power to punish him. He may or may not have cheated your poor  father. At this distance of time you can prove nothing against him, except that  he played &eacute;cart&eacute; in the private room of a caf&eacute;, and that he won all your father&rsquo;s  money. He would only laugh in your face, my poor Nelly, if you were to bring such  a charge as this against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I can once prove that, which I now believe as firmly as if every mortal proof had  demonstrated its truth, I know how to punish Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know how to punish him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  His uncle&mdash;that is to say, his great uncle&mdash;Maurice de Crespigny, was my father&rsquo;s  firmest friend. I need not tell you that story, Dick, for you have heard it often  enough from my poor father&rsquo;s own lips. Launcelot Darrell expects to inherit the  old man&rsquo;s money, and will do so if Mr. de Crespigny dies without making a will.  But if I could prove to the old man that my father died a melancholy and untimely  death through his nephew&rsquo;s treachery, Launcelot Darrell would never inherit a sixpence  of that money. I know how eagerly he looks forward to it, though he affects indifference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you would do this, Eleanor?&rdquo; asked Richard, staring aghast at his companion; &ldquo;you  would betray the secrets of this young man&rsquo;s youth to his uncle, and compass his  ruin by that revelation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would  do what I swore to do in the Rue l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que. I would avenge my father&rsquo;s death.  The last words my poor father ever wrote appealed to me to do that. I have never  forgotten those words. There may have been a deeper treachery in that night&rsquo;s work  than you or I know of, Richard. Launcelot Darrell knew who my father was&mdash;he knew  of the friendship between him and Mr. de Crespigny. How do we know that he did not  try to goad the poor old man to that last act of his despair; how do we know that  he did not plan those losses at cards, in order to remove his uncle&rsquo;s friend from  his pathway? Oh, God! Richard, if I thought that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  girl rose from her chair in a sudden tumult of passion, with her hands clenched  and her eyes flashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I could think that his treachery went beyond the baseness of cheating my father  of his money for the money&rsquo;s sake, I would take his life for that dear life as freely  and as unhesitatingly as I lift my hand up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  raised her clenched hand towards the ceiling as she spoke, as if to register some  unuttered vow. Then, turning abruptly to the scene-painter, she said, almost imploringly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t be, Richard; he cannot have been so base as that. He held my hand in his only  a few days ago. I would cut off that hand if I could think that Launcelot Darrell  had planned my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you cannot think it, my dear Eleanor,&rdquo; Richard answered, earnestly. &ldquo;How should  the young man know that your father would take his loss so deeply to heart? We none  of us calculate the consequences of our sins, my dear. If this man cheated, he cheated  because he wanted money. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Nelly, leave him and his sin in the  hands of Providence.  The future is not a blank sheet of paper, Nelly, for us to write any story we please  upon; but a wonderful chart mapped out by a divine and unerring hand. Launcelot  Darrell will not go unpunished, Nelly. &lsquo;My faith is strong in Time,&rsquo; as the poet  says. Leave the young man to Time&mdash;and to Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane shook her head, smiling bitterly at her friend&rsquo;s philosophy. Poor mad Constance&rsquo;s reply always rose, in some shape or other, to  the girl&rsquo;s lips in answer to Richard&rsquo;s arguments. The Cardinal reasons with wonderful  discretion, but the bereaved mother utters one sentence that is more powerful than  all the worthy man&rsquo;s prim moralities:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  talks to me, that never had a son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is no use preaching to me,&rdquo; Miss Vane said. &ldquo;If <em>your</em> father had died by this  man&rsquo;s treachery, you would not feel so charitably disposed towards him. I <em>will</em> keep the promise made three years ago. I <em>will</em> prove Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s guilt;  and that guilt shall stand between him and Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  forget one point in this business, Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  may take you a very long time to obtain the proof you want. Mr. de Crespigny is  an old man, and an invalid. He may die before you are in a position to denounce  his nephew&rsquo;s treachery to your poor father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  was silent for a few moments. Her arched brows contracted, and her mouth grew compressed  and rigid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must  go back to Hazlewood, Dick,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;Yes, you are right; there is no  time to be lost. I <em>must</em> go back to Hazlewood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  is not very practicable, is it, Nell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>must</em> go back. If I go in some disguise&mdash;if I go and hide myself in the village, and watch  Launcelot Darrell when he least thinks he is observed. I don&rsquo;t care how I go, Richard,  but I must be there. It can only be from the discoveries I make in the present,  that I shall be able to trace my way back to the history of the past. I must go  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  begin at once upon the business of a detective? Eleanor, you shall not do this,  if I can prevent you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton&rsquo;s unavowed love gave him a certain degree of authority over the impulsive  girl. There is always a dignity and power in every feeling that is really true.  Throughout the story of Notre Dame de Paris, the hunchback&rsquo;s love for Esmeralda  is never once contemptible. It is only Ph&oelig;bus, handsome, glittering, false, and  hollow, who provokes our scorn.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane did not rebel against the young man&rsquo;s tone of authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Dick, Dick,&rdquo; she cried, piteously, &ldquo;I know how wicked I am. I have been nothing  but a trouble to you and the dear Signora. But I cannot forget my father&rsquo;s death.  I cannot forget the letter he wrote to me. I must be true to the vow I made then,  Richard, if I sacrifice my life in keeping my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eliza  Picirillo came in before the scene-painter could reply to this speech. It had been  agreed between the two young people that the Signora should know nothing of Miss  Vane&rsquo;s discoveries; so Eleanor and Richard saluted the music-mistress in that strain  of factitious gaiety generally adopted under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Signora  Picirillo&rsquo;s perceptions were perhaps a little blunted by the wear and tear of half-a-dozen  hours&rsquo; labour amongst her out-door pupils, and as Eleanor bustled about the room  preparing the tea-table and making the tea, the good music-mistress fully believed  in her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e&rsquo;s simulated liveliness. When the table had been cleared, and Richard  had gone to smoke his short meerschaum amongst the damp straw and invalid cabs in  the promenade before the Pilasters, Eleanor seated herself at the piano and practised.  Her fingers flew over the keys in a thousand complexities of harmony, but her mind,  for ever true to one idea, brooded upon the dark scheme of vengeance which she had  planned for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  what may,&rdquo; she thought, again and again, &ldquo;at any price I must go back to Hazlewood.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  The One Chance</strong></h2>
<p>Eleanor Vane lay awake through the greater part of the night which  succeeded her interview with the shipbroker. She lay awake, trying to fashion for  herself some scheme by which she might go back to Hazlewood. The discovery which  she had to make, the proof positive that she wanted to obtain of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  guilt, could only be procured by long and patient watchfulness of the young man  himself. The evidence that was to condemn him must come from his own lips. Some  chance admission, some accidental word, might afford a clue that would guide her  back to the secret of the past. But to obtain this clue she must be in intimate  association with the man whom she suspected. In the careless confidence of daily  life, in the freedom of social intercourse, a hundred chances might occur which  could never be brought about while the gates of Hazlewood were closed upon her.</p>
<p>There  was one other chance, it was true. Launcelot Darrell had asked her to become his  wife. His love, however feeble to withstand the wear and tear of time, must for  the moment, at least, be real. A line from her would no doubt bring him to her side.  She could lure him on by affecting to return his affection, and in the entire confidence  of such an association she might discover.</p>
<p>No!  not for the wide world&mdash;not even to be true to her dead father&mdash;could she be so false  to every sentiment of womanly honour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard  was right,&rdquo; she thought, as she dismissed this idea with a humiliating sense of  her own baseness in having even for one brief moment entertained it. &ldquo;He was right.  What shame and degradation I must wade through before I can keep my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  to keep her promise she must go back to Hazlewood. This was the point to which she  always returned. But was it possible for her to regain her old position in Mrs.  Darrell&rsquo;s house? Would not Mrs. Darrell take care to keep her away, having once  succeeded in banishing her from Launcelot&rsquo;s society?</p>
<p>Miss  Vane was not a good schemer. Transparent, ingenuous, and impulsive, she had the  will and the courage which would have prompted her to denounce Launcelot Darrell  as a traitor and a cheat; but not the slow and patient attributes which are necessary  for the watcher who hopes to trace a shameful secret through all the dark intricacies  of the hidden pathway that leads to it.</p>
<p>It was  long after daylight when the young lady fell asleep, worn out, harassed, and baffled.  The night had brought no counsel. Eleanor Vane dropped off into a fitful slumber,  with a passionate prayer upon her lips,&mdash;a prayer that Providence would set her in  the way of bringing vengeance upon her father&rsquo;s destroyer.</p>
<p>She  flung herself upon Providence&mdash;after  the manner of a great many persons&mdash;when she found her own intellect powerless to  conduct her to the end she wanted to gain.</p>
<p>Throughout  the next day Miss Vane sat alone on the chintz-covered sofa by the window, looking  down at the children playing hop-scotch and gambling for marbles upon the rugged  flags below; &ldquo;weary of the rolling hours,&rdquo; and unable to bring herself to the frame  of mind necessary for the ordinary purposes of life. Upon any other occasion she  would have tried to do something whereby she might lighten the Signora&rsquo;s burden,  being quite competent to take the pupils off her friend&rsquo;s hands; but to-day she  had suffered Eliza Picirillo to trudge out under the broiling August sky, through  the stifling London streets, and had made no attempt to lessen her labours. She  seemed even incapable of performing the little domestic offices which she had been  in the habit of doing. She let the London dust accumulate upon the piano; she left  the breakfast-table scattered with the d&eacute;bris of the morning&rsquo;s meal; she made no  effort to collect the stray sheets of music, the open books, the scraps of needlework  that littered the room; but with her elbow on the smoky sill of the window, and  her head resting on her hand, she sat, looking wearily out, with eyes that saw nothing  but vacancy.</p>
<p>Richard  had gone out early, and neither he nor his aunt were expected to return till dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can  have everything ready for them when they come back,&rdquo; she thought, looking listlessly  at the unwashed tea-things, which seemed to stare at her in mute reproachfulness;  and then her eyes wandered back to the sunny window, and her mind returned with  a cruel constancy to the one idea that occupied it.</p>
<p>Had  she been really looking at the objects on which her eyes seemed to be fixed, she  must have been surprised by the advent of a tall and rather distinguished-looking  stranger, who made his way along the straw-littered promenade between the colonnade  and the stables, erasing the chalk plans of the hop-scotch players with the soles  of his boots, and rendering himself otherwise objectionable to the juvenile population.</p>
<p>This  stranger came straight to the shop of the shoemaker with whom Signora Picirillo  lodged, and inquired for Miss Vincent.</p>
<p>The  shoemaker had only heard Eleanor&rsquo;s assumed name a day or two before, when Laura&rsquo;s  letter had arrived at the Pilasters. He had a vague idea that the beautiful, golden-haired  young woman, who had first entered his dwelling in the early freshness of budding  girlhood, was going to distinguish herself as a great musical genius, and intended  to astonish the professional world under a false name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  Miss Eleanor you want, I suppose, sir?&rdquo; the man said, in answer to the stranger&rsquo;s  question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Eleanor&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,  if you&rsquo;ll please to step up-stairs, sir. The young lady&rsquo;s all alone to-day, for  Mr. Richard he&rsquo;s over the water a scene-paintin&rsquo; away for dear life, and the S&rsquo;nora  she&rsquo;s out givin&rsquo; lessons; so poor young miss is alone, and dismal enough she must  be, cooped in-doors this fine weather. It&rsquo;s bad enough when one&rsquo;s obliged to it,  you know, sir,&rdquo; the man added, rather obscurely. &ldquo;Will you please to walk up, sir?  It&rsquo;s the door facing you at the top of the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  shoemaker opened a half-glass door communicating with a tiny back parlour and a  steep staircase that twisted corkscrew-wise up to the first floor. The visitor waited  for no further invitation, but ascended the stairs in a few strides, and paused  for a moment before the door of Signora Picirillo&rsquo;s sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  one of these here London  managers, I dessay,&rdquo; thought the simple cordwainer, as he went back to his work.  &ldquo;Mr. Cromshaw come here one day after Mr. Richard, in a ph<em>ee</em>aton and pair,  and no end of diamond rings and breast-pins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane had not noticed the stranger&rsquo;s footsteps on the uncarpeted stair, but she started  when the door opened, and looked round. Her unexpected visitor was Mr. Monckton.</p>
<p>She  rose in confusion, and stood with her back to the window, looking at the lawyer.  She was too much absorbed by her one idea to be troubled by the untidiness of the  shabby chamber, by the disorder of her own hair or dress, or by any of those external  circumstances which are generally so embarrassing to a woman. She only thought of  Gilbert Monckton as a link between herself and Hazlewood. She did not even wonder  why he had come to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may  find out something; I may learn something from him,&rdquo; she thought. Against the great  purpose of her life, even this man, who of all others she most respected and esteemed,  sank into utter insignificance. She never cared to consider what he might think.  She only regarded him as an instrument which might happen to be of use to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are very much surprised to see me, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; the lawyer said, holding out his  hand.</p>
<p>The  girl put her hand loosely in his, and Gilbert Monckton started as he felt the feverish  heat of the slim fingers that touched his so lightly. He looked into Eleanor&rsquo;s face.  The intense excitement of the last three days had left its traces on her countenance.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell had made a confidant of the lawyer. It had been absolutely necessary to  explain Eleanor&rsquo;s absence. Mrs. Darrell had given her own version of the business,  telling the truth, with sundry reservations. Miss Vincent was a handsome and agreeable  girl, she said; it was of vital consequence to Launcelot that he should not form  any attachment, or entertain any passing fancy, that might militate against his  future prospects. An imprudent marriage had separated her, Mrs. Darrell, from her  uncle, Maurice de Crespigny. An imprudent marriage might ruin the young man&rsquo;s chance  of inheriting the Woodlands estate. Under these circumstances it was advisable that  Miss Vincent should leave Hazlewood; and the young lady had very generously resigned  her situation, upon the matter being put before her in a proper light.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Darrell took very good care not to make any allusion to that declaration of love  which she had overheard through the half-open door of her son&rsquo;s painting-room.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton had expressed no little vexation at the sudden departure of his ward&rsquo;s  companion; but his annoyance was of course felt solely on account of Miss Mason,  who told him, with her eyes streaming, and her voice broken by sobs, that she could  never, never be happy without her darling Eleanor.</p>
<p>The  lawyer said very little in reply to these lamentations, but took care to get Miss  Vincent&rsquo;s address from his ward, and on the day after his visit to Hazlewood went  straight from his office to the Pilasters.</p>
<p>Looking  at the change in Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s face, Mr. Monckton began to wonder very seriously  if the departure from Hazlewood had been a matter of great grief to her; and whether  it might not be that Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s alarms about her son&rsquo;s possible admiration for  the penniless companion were founded on stronger grounds than the widow had cared  to reveal to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  afraid that Laura&rsquo;s frivolous fancy might be caught by this young fellow,&rdquo; he thought,  &ldquo;but I could never have believed that this girl, who has ten times Laura&rsquo;s intellect,  would fall in love with Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought  this, while Eleanor&rsquo;s feverish hand lay, loose and passive, in his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was not quite kind of you to leave Hazlewood without seeing me, or consulting me,  Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;you must remember that I confided to you a trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  You promised that you would look after my foolish young ward, and take care that  she did not fall in love with Mr. Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton watched the girl&rsquo;s face very closely while he pronounced Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  name, but there was no revelation in that pale and wearied countenance. The gray  eyes returned his gaze, frankly and unhesitatingly. Their brightness was faded,  but their innocent candour remained in all its virginal beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried  to do what you wished,&rdquo; Miss Vane answered. &ldquo;I am afraid that Laura does admire  Mr. Darrell. But I can&rsquo;t quite understand whether she is serious or not, and in  any case nothing I could say would influence her much, though I know she loves me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I suppose not,&rdquo; said Mr. Monckton, rather bitterly, &ldquo;women are not easily to be  influenced in these matters. A woman&rsquo;s love is the sublimation of selfishness, Miss  Vincent. It is delightful to a woman to throw herself away; and she is perfectly  indifferent as to how many unoffending victims she drags to destruction in her downfall.  An Indian woman sacrifices herself out of respect to her dead husband. An English  woman offers up her husband and children on the altar of a living lover. Pardon  me if I speak too plainly. We lawyers become acquainted with strange stories. I  should not at all wonder if my ward were to insist upon making herself miserable  for life because Launcelot Darrell has a Grecian nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton seated himself, uninvited, by the table on which the unwashed tea-things  bore testimonies to Eleanor&rsquo;s neglect. He looked round the room, not rudely, for  in one brief observant glance he was able to see everything, and to understand everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you ever <em>lived</em> here, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I lived here a year and a half before I went to Hazlewood. I was very happy,&rdquo; Eleanor  added hastily, as if in deprecation of the lawyer&rsquo;s look, which betrayed a half-compassionate  interest. &ldquo;My friends are very good to me, and I never wish for a better home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you have been accustomed to a better home, in your childhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  not very much better. I always lived in lodgings, with my poor father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  father was not rich then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  not at all rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  was a professional man, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  he had no profession. He had been rich&mdash;very rich&mdash;once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  colour rose to Eleanor&rsquo;s face as she spoke, for she suddenly recollected that she  had a secret to keep. The lawyer might recognise George Vane by this description,  she thought.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton fancied that sudden blush arose from wounded pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive  me for asking you so many questions, Miss Vincent,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I am very much  interested in you. I have been very much interested in you for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was  silent for some minutes. Eleanor had resumed her seat near the window, and sat in  a thoughtful attitude, with her eyes cast upon the ground. She was wondering how  she was to make good use of this interview in discovering as much as possible of  Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s antecedents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you forgive me if I ask you a few more questions, Miss Vincent?&rdquo; the lawyer asked,  after this brief silence.</p>
<p>Eleanor  raised her eyes, and looked him full in the face. That bright, straight, unfaltering  gaze was perhaps the greatest charm which Miss Vane possessed. She had no reason  to complain that Nature had gifted her with a niggardly hand; she had beauty of  feature, of outline, of colour; but this exquisitely candid expression was a rarer  beauty, and a higher gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe  me,&rdquo; said Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;that I am actuated by no unworthy motive when I ask you  to deal frankly with me. You will understand, by-and-bye, why and by what right  I presume to question you. In the meantime I ask you to confide in me. You left  Hazlewood at Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s wish, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was at her wish that I left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her  son had made you an offer of his hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  question would have brought a blush to the face of an ordinary girl. But Eleanor  Vane was removed from ordinary women by the exceptional story of her life. From  the moment of her discovery of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s identity, all thoughts of him  as a lover, or an admirer, had been blotted out of her mind. He was removed from  other men by the circumstances of his guilt; as she was set apart from other women  by the revengeful purpose in her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;Mr. Darrell asked me to be his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  did you&mdash;did you refuse him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  I gave him no answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  did not love him then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love  him! Oh, no, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  eyes dilated with a look of surprise as she spoke, as if it was most astounding  to her that Gilbert Monckton should ask her such a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  you do not think Launcelot Darrell worthy of a good woman&rsquo;s love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do  not,&rdquo; answered Eleanor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of him, please. At least, I mean, don&rsquo;t talk  of him, and of&mdash;love,&rdquo; she added hastily, remembering that the very thing she wished  was that the lawyer should talk of Launcelot Darrell. &ldquo;You&mdash;you must know a great  deal of his youth. He was idle and dissipated, was he not; and&mdash;and&mdash;a card-player?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A card-player?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;a  gambler; a man who plays cards for the sake of winning money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never  heard any one say so. He was idle, no doubt, and loitered away his time in London under the pretence  of studying art; but I never remember hearing that gambling was one of his vices.  However, I don&rsquo;t come here to speak of him, but of you. What are you going to do,  now that you have left Hazlewood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  was cruelly embarrassed by this question. Her most earnest wish was to return to  Hazlewood, or at least to the neighbourhood. Absorbed by this wish she had formed  no scheme for the future. She had not even remembered that she stood alone in the  world, with only a few pounds saved out of her slender salary, unprovided with that  which is the most necessary of all weapons in any warfare, Money!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  scarcely know what I shall do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mrs. Darrell promised to procure me a  situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  as she spoke she remembered that to accept a situation of Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s getting  would be in some manner to eat bread provided by the kinswoman of her father&rsquo;s foe,  and she made a mental vow to starve rather than to receive the widow&rsquo;s patronage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do  not put much confidence in Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s friendship when her own end is gained,&rdquo;  Gilbert Monckton said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Ellen Darrell is only capable of loving one  person, and that person is, according to the fashion of the world, the one who has  used her worst. She loves her son, Launcelot, and would sacrifice a hecatomb of  her fellow-creatures for his advantage. If she can get you a new home, I dare say  she will do so. If she cannot, she has succeeded in removing you from her son&rsquo;s  pathway, and will trouble herself very little about your future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane lifted her head with a sudden gesture of pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do  not want Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you would not refuse the counsel, or even the help of any one you liked, would you,  Eleanor?&rdquo; returned the lawyer. &ldquo;You are very young, very inexperienced,&mdash;the life  at Hazlewood suited you, and it might have gone on for years without danger of unhappiness  or disquiet, but for the coming of Launcelot Darrell. I have known you for a year  and a half, Miss Vincent, and I have watched you very closely. I think I know you  very well. Yes, if a lawyer&rsquo;s powers of penetration and habit of observation are  to go for anything, I <em>must</em> know you by this time. I may have been an egregious  fool twenty years ago; but I must be wise enough now to understand a girl of eighteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said  this rather as if reasoning with himself than talking to Eleanor. Miss Vane looked  at him, wondering what all this talk would lead to, and what motive, under heaven,  could have induced a lawyer of high standing to leave his chambers in the middle  of the business day, for the purpose of sitting in a shabby lodging-house chamber,  with his elbow resting upon a dirty table-cloth amid the confusion of unwashed breakfast  cups and saucers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor  Vincent,&rdquo; Mr. Monckton said by-and-bye, after a very long pause, &ldquo;country people  are most intolerable gossips. You cannot have lived at Hazlewood for a year and  a half without having heard something of my history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  you heard that there was some secret trouble in the early part of my life&mdash;that there  were some unpleasant circumstances connected with my purchase of Tolldale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane was utterly unskilled in the art of prevarication. She could not give an evasive  answer to a straight question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;I have heard people say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you have no doubt heard them say that my trouble&mdash;like every other trouble upon this  earth, as it seems to me&mdash;was caused by a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I heard that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  very young when that sorrow came to me, Eleanor Vincent, and very ready to believe  in a beautiful face. I was deceived. My story is all told in those three words,  and it is a very old story after all. Great tragedies and epic poems have been written  upon the same theme until it has become so hackneyed that I have no need to enlarge  upon it. I was deceived, Miss Vincent, and for twenty years I have profited by that  bitter lesson. Heaven help me if I feel inclined to forget it now. I am forty years  of age, but I do not think that the brightness of my life has quite gone yet. Twenty  years ago I was in love, and in the ardour and freshness of my youth, I dare say  I talked a great deal of nonsense. I am in love once more, Eleanor. Will you forgive  me if all my faculty for sentimental talk is lost? Will you let me tell you, in  very few and simple words, that I love you; that I have loved you for a very long  time; and that you will make me unspeakably happy if you can think my earnest devotion  worthy of some return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every  vestige of colour faded slowly from Eleanor&rsquo;s face. There had been a time&mdash;before  the return of Launcelot Darrell&mdash;when a word of praise, an expression of friendliness  or regard from Gilbert Monckton, had been very precious to her. She had never taken  the trouble to analyse her feelings. That time, before the coming of the young man,  had been the sunniest and most careless period of her youth. She had during that  interval been false to the memory of her father&mdash;she had suffered herself to be happy.  But now a gulf yawned between her and that lapse of forgetfulness. She could not  look back clearly; she could not remember or recall her former feelings. Gilbert  Monckton&rsquo;s offer might then have awakened some answering sentiment in her own breast.  Now his hand struck upon the slackened chords of a shattered instrument; and there  was no music to respond harmoniously to the player&rsquo;s touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can  you love me, Eleanor? Can you love me?&rdquo; the lawyer asked, imploringly, taking the  girl&rsquo;s hands in his own. &ldquo;Your heart is free: yes, I know that; and that at least  is something. Heaven forgive me if I try to bribe you. But my youth is passed, and  I can scarcely expect to be loved for myself alone. Think how dreary and undefended  your life must be, if you refuse my love and protection. Think of that, Eleanor.  Ah! if you knew what a woman is when thrown upon the world <em>without</em> the shelter  of a husband&rsquo;s love, you would think seriously. I want you to be more than my wife,  Eleanor. I want you to be the guardian and protectress of that poor frivolous girl  whose future has been trusted to my care. I want you to come and live at Tolldale,  my darling, so as to be near that poor child at Hazlewood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near  Hazlewood! The hot blood rushed into Eleanor&rsquo;s face at the sound of those two words,  then faded suddenly away and left her deadly white, trembling and clinging to the  back of her chair for support. To all else that Gilbert Monckton had said she had  listened in a dull stupor. But now her intellect arose and grasped the full importance  of the lawyer&rsquo;s supplication. In a moment she understood that the one chance which  of all other things upon this earth she had most desired, and which of all other  things had seemed furthest removed from her, was now within her reach.</p>
<p>She  might go back to Hazlewood. She might return as Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s wife. She did  not stop to consider how much was involved in this. It was her nature to be ruled  by impulse, and impulse only; and she had yet to learn submission to a better guidance.  She could go back to Hazlewood. She would have returned there as a kitchen-maid,  had the opportunity of so doing offered itself to her; and she was ready to return  as Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  prayers have been heard,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;My prayers have been heard: Providence will give me power  to keep my promise. Providence  will set me face to face with that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane stood with her hands clasped upon the back of her chair, thinking of this,  and looking straight before her, in utter unconsciousness of the earnest eyes that  were fixed upon her face, while the lawyer waited breathlessly to hear her decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor,&rdquo;  he cried, entreatingly, &ldquo;Eleanor, I have been deceived once; do not let me be a  woman&rsquo;s dupe, now that there are streaks of grey amongst my hair. I love you, my  dear. I can make you independent and secure; but I do not offer you a fortune or  a position of sufficient magnitude or grandeur to tempt an ambitious woman. For  God&rsquo;s sake, do not trifle with me. If you love me now, or can hope to love me in  the future, be my wife. But if any other image holds the smallest place in your  heart&mdash;if there is one memory, or one regret, that can come between us, Eleanor,  dismiss me from you unhesitatingly. It will be merciful to me&mdash;to you also, perhaps&mdash;to  do so. I have seen a union in which there was love on one side, and indifference&mdash;or  something worse than indifference&mdash;upon the other. Eleanor, think of all this, and  then tell me, frankly, if you can after all be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane dimly comprehended that there was a depth of passionate feeling beneath the  quiet earnestness of the lawyer&rsquo;s manner. She tried to listen, she tried to comprehend;  but she could not. The one idea which held possession of her mind, kept that mind  locked against every other impression. It was not his love, it was not his name,  or his fortune, that Gilbert Monckton offered her&mdash;he offered her the chance of returning  to Hazlewood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are very good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will be your wife. I will go back to Hazlewood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  held out her hand to him. No trace of womanly confusion, or natural coquetry, betrayed  itself in her manner. Pale and absorbed she held out her hand, and offered up her  future as a small and unconsidered matter, when set against the one idea of her  life&mdash;the promise to her dead father.</p>

  Accepted</strong></h2>
<p>When  a man sets his happiness in the balance, he is apt to be contented with a very slight  turning of the scale. He is not likely to be critical as to the wording of the verdict  which gives him the prize he has asked for.</p>
<p>Mr.  Gilbert Monckton had no contemptible opinion of his own judgment and deliberation,  his perceptive faculties and powers of reasoning; but as blindly as <em>Macbeth</em> accepted the promises of the oracular voices in the witches&rsquo; cave, so did this grave  and eminent lawyer receive those few cold words in which Eleanor Vane consented  to be his wife.</p>
<p>Not  that he refrained from reflecting upon the girl&rsquo;s manner of accepting his offer.  He did reflect upon it; and proved to himself, by unerring logic, that she could  scarcely have spoken in any other way. There were a thousand reasons why she should  have employed those very words, and pronounced them in that very tone. Maidenly  modesty, innocent surprise, inexperience, girlish timidity:&mdash;he ran over a whole  catalogue of causes, naming every possible cause, save one, and that one was the  thing he had most dreaded&mdash;indifference, or even repugnance to himself. He looked  into her face. His professional career had given him the faculty of putting together  the evidences of smiles and frowns, involuntary contractions of the eyebrows, scarcely  perceptible compressions of the lips, every tone and semi-tone in the facial diapason.  He looked at Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s face, and said to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  girl <em>cannot</em> be mercenary. She is as pure as an angel; as unselfish as Jephtha&rsquo;s  daughter; as brave as Judith, or Joan of Arc. She <em>cannot</em> be anything but  a good wife. The man who wins her has reason to thank God for His bounty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  with such thoughts as these that the lawyer received the feminine decision which  was to influence his future life. He bent over the girl&rsquo;s fair head&mdash;tall as she  was, her face was only on a level with Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;and pressed his  lips to her forehead, solemnly, almost as if setting a seal upon his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  darling,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice, &ldquo;my darling, you have made me very happy; I dare  not tell you how much I love you. I struggled against my love, Eleanor. I once meant  to have kept the secret till I went down to my grave. I think I could have kept  silence so long as you remained within my reach, protected and sheltered by people  whom I could trust, happy in the bright years of your innocent girlhood. But when  you left Hazlewood, when you went out into the world, my courage failed. I wanted  to give you my love as a shield and a defence. Better that I should be deceived,  I thought; better that I should be miserable, than that she should be undefended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane listened to the lawyer&rsquo;s happy talk. He could have talked to her for ever,  now that the ice was broken, and the important step&mdash;so long considered, so long  avoided&mdash;actually taken. It seemed as if his youth came back to him, bestowed by  some miraculous power; invisible, but most palpably present in that shabby Bloomsbury dwelling. His youth came back: the intellectual  cobwebs of twenty years were swept away by one stroke of some benevolent witch&rsquo;s  broomstick. Cherished prejudices, fondly nursed doubts and suspicions, were blotted  out of his mind, leaving the tablet fair and bright as it had been before the coming  of that shadow which had darkened so much of this man&rsquo;s life. Sudden almost as the  conversion of Saul, was this transformation of the misanthropical solicitor under  the master influence of a true and pure affection.</p>
<p>For  twenty years he had sneered at women, and at men&rsquo;s belief in them; and now, at the  end of twenty years, he believed; and, escaping out of the prison which he had made  for himself, he spread his recovered wings and was free.</p>
<p>A sigh  escaped from Eleanor&rsquo;s lips as she listened to her lover. The time in which she  could have hoped to pay him back all this great debt which he was heaping upon her,  was past and gone. She felt a sense of oppression beneath the load of this obligation.  She began to perceive&mdash;as yet only dimly, so intense was the egotism engendered out  of the single purpose of her life&mdash;that she was binding herself to something that  she might not be able to perform; she was taking upon herself a debt that she could  scarcely hope to pay. For a moment she thought this, and was ready, under this new  impulse, to draw back and say, &ldquo;I cannot become your wife; I am too much tied and  bound by the obligations of the past, to be able to fulfil the duties of the present.  I am set apart from other women, and must stand alone until the task I have set  myself is accomplished, or the hope of its fulfilment abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  thought this, and the words trembled on her lips; but in the next moment the image  of her father arose angry and reproachful, as if to say to her, &ldquo;Have you so little  memory of my wrongs and my sorrows that you can shrink from any means of avenging  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  idea banished every other consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  keep my promise first, and do my duty to Gilbert Monckton afterwards,&rdquo; thought Eleanor.  &ldquo;It will be easy to be a good wife to him. I used to like him very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  recalled the old days in which she had sat a little way apart from the lawyer and  his ward, envying Laura Mason her apparent influence over Mr. Monckton; and for  a moment a faint thrill of pleasure and triumph vibrated through her veins as she  remembered that henceforth her claim upon him would be higher than that of any other  living creature. He would be her own&mdash;her lover, her husband&mdash;adviser, friend, instructor;  everything in the wide world to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  let me avenge my father&rsquo;s cruel death,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and then I may be a good and  happy wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton could have stood for ever by the side of his betrothed wife in the sunny  window looking out upon the mews. The prospect of a few stable doors, lounging grooms  smoking and drinking in the intervals of their labour, scantily draperied women  hanging out newly-washed linen, and making as it were triumphal arches of wet garments  across the narrow thoroughfare, the children playing hopscotch, or called away from  that absorbing diversion to fetch damp steaming quartern loaves and jugs of beer  for their elders,&mdash;all these things were beautiful in the eyes of the owner of Tolldale  Priory. An overplus of that sunshine which filled his breast glorified these common  objects, and Mr. Monckton gazed upon the angular proportions of the bony Roman-nosed  horses, the classic outlines of decrepit Hansom cabs, and all the other objects  peculiar to the neighbourhood of the Pilasters, with such a radiance of contentment  and delight upon his face as might have induced the observer, looking at his face  and <em>not</em> at the prospect, to believe that the bay of Naples was spread out  in purple splendour under the open window of Miss Vane&rsquo;s sitting-room.</p>
<p>Signora  Picirillo returned from her day&rsquo;s labours, and found the lawyer thus absorbed; but  he understood directly who she was, and greeted her with a cordiality that very  much astonished the music mistress. Eleanor Vane slipped out of the room while Mr.  Monckton was explaining himself to the Signora. She was only too glad to get away  from the man to whom she had so rashly bound herself. She went to the glass to brush  her hair away from her hot forehead, and then threw herself on the bed, prostrated  by all the excitement she had undergone, powerless even to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost  wish I could lie here for ever,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;it seems so like peace to lie still  and leave off thinking.&rdquo; Her youth had held out bravely against the burdens she  had put upon her strength and spirits, but the young energies had given way at last,  and she fell into a heavy dreamless slumber; a blessed and renovating sleep from  which nature takes compensation for the wrongs that have been done her.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton told his story very briefly and simply. He had no occasion to say much  himself, for Eleanor had written a great deal about him in her letters to the Signora,  and had often talked of him during her one holiday at the Pilasters.</p>
<p>Eliza  Picirillo was too entirely unselfish to feel otherwise than pleased at the idea  that Eleanor Vane had won the love of a good man whose position in life would remove  her from every danger and from every trial; but, mingled with this unselfish delight,  there was a painful recollection. The music mistress had fathomed her nephew&rsquo;s secret,  and she felt that Eleanor&rsquo;s marriage would be a sad blow to Richard Thornton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  believe poor Dick ever hoped to win her love,&rdquo; Signora Picirillo thought; &ldquo;but if  he could have gone on loving her and admiring her, and associating with her, in  a frank brotherly way, he might have been happy. Perhaps it&rsquo;s better as it is, though;  perhaps that very uncertainty might have blighted his life and shut him out from  some possible happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  my dear girl is an orphan,&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton said, &ldquo;I feel that you, Madame Picirillo,  are the only person I need consult. I have heard from Eleanor how much she owes  you; and believe me that when I ask her to become my wife, I do not wish her to  be less your adopted daughter. She has told me that in the greatest miseries of  her life, you were as true a friend to her as her own mother could have been. She  has never told me what those miseries were, but I trust her so fully that I do not  care to torment her with questions about a past which she tells me was sorrowful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eliza  Picirillo&rsquo;s eyelids fell under the earnest gaze of the lawyer; she remembered the  deception that had been practised upon Mrs. Darrell in deference to the pride of  Eleanor&rsquo;s half-sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  Mr. Monckton must know Nelly&rsquo;s story before he marries her,&rdquo; thought the straightforward  Signora. She explained this to Eleanor the next morning when the girl rose, invigorated  by a long sleep, and inspired by a desperate hopefulness&mdash;the hope of avenging her  father&rsquo;s wrongs speedily.</p>
<p>For  some time Miss Vane passionately combated the Signora&rsquo;s arguments. Why should she  tell Gilbert Monckton her real name? she demanded. She wished to keep it a secret  from Mr. de Crespigny; from the people at Hazlewood. She must keep it a secret,  she said.</p>
<p>But  little by little Eliza Picirillo overcame this determination. She explained to the  passionate girl that if her marriage was to be legally unassailable, she must be  married in her true name. She explained this; and she said a great deal about the  moral wrong which would be done if Eleanor persisted in deceiving her future husband.</p>
<p>The  marriage was pushed on with terrible haste, as it seemed to Richard Thornton and  the Signora; but even the brief delay that occurred between Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s declaration  of his love and the day fixed for the wedding was almost intolerable to Eleanor.  The all-important step which was to make her the lawyer&rsquo;s wife seemed nothing to  her. She ignored this great crisis of her life altogether, in her desire to return  to Hazlewood, to discover and denounce Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s treachery before Maurice  de Crespigny&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>There  were preparations to be made, and a trousseau to be provided. It was a very simple  trousseau, fitter for the bride of some young curate with seventy pounds a year,  than for the lady who was to be mistress of Tolldale Priory. Eleanor took no interest  in the pretty girlish dresses, pale and delicate in colour, simple and inexpensive  in texture and fashion, which the Signora chose for her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. There was a settlement  to be drawn up also; for Gilbert Monckton insisted upon treating his betrothed as  generously as if she had been a woman of distinction, with an aristocratic father  to bargain and diplomatise for her welfare; but Eleanor was as indifferent to the  settlement as about the trousseau, and could scarcely be made to understand that,  on and after her wedding-day, she would be the exclusive possessor of a small landed  estate worth three hundred a year.</p>
<p>Once,  and once only, she thanked Gilbert Monckton for his generosity; and this was when,  for the first time, the thought flashed into her mind, that this three hundred a  year, to which she was so indifferent, would enable her to place Eliza Picirillo  in a position of independence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear  Signora,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you shall never work after I am married. How good it is of  you to give me this money, Mr. Monckton,&rdquo; she added, her eyes filling with sudden  tears; &ldquo;I will try to deserve your goodness, I will, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  upon the evening on which Eleanor spoke these few grateful and earnest words to  her betrothed husband, that the revelation of her secret was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  going to Doctors&rsquo; Commons to-morrow morning, Signora,&rdquo; the lawyer said, as he rose  to leave the little sitting-room,&mdash;he had spent his evenings in the Pilasters during  his brief courtship, perfectly at home, and unspeakably happy in that shabby and  Bohemian colony. &ldquo;Eleanor and I have determined that our marriage is to take place  at St. George&rsquo;s, Bloomsbury.  A very quiet wedding. My two partners, yourself, and Mr. Thornton, are to be the  only witnesses. The Berkshire people will be surprised  when I take my young wife back to Tolldale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was  going away, when the Signora laid her hand on Eleanor&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <em>must</em> tell him to-night, Nelly,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;he must not be allowed to  take out the licence in a false name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  girl bent her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  do as you wish, Signora,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Five  minutes afterwards, when Gilbert Monckton gave Eleanor his hand, she said, quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  not say good night yet. I will come downstairs with you, I have something to say  to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  went down the narrow staircase, and out into the colonnade with Mr. Monckton. It  was ten o&rsquo;clock; the shops were closed, and the public-house was quiet. Under the  August moonlight the shabby tenements looked less common-place, the dilapidated  wooden colonnade was almost picturesque. Miss Vane stood with her face turned frankly  towards her lover, her figure resting slightly against one of the slender pillars  before the shoemaker&rsquo;s emporium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is it that you want to tell me, Eleanor dearest?&rdquo; Mr. Monckton asked, as she paused,  looking half-doubtfully in his face, as if uncertain what she should say to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want  to tell you that I have done very wrong&mdash;I have deceived you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deceived  me! Eleanor! Eleanor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  saw the lawyer&rsquo;s face turn pale under the moonlight. That word deception had such  a terrible meaning to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have deceived you. I have kept a secret from you, and I can only tell it to you  now upon one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon  what condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  you do not tell it to Mr. de Crespigny, or to Mrs. Darrell, until you have my permission  to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton smiled. His sudden fears fled away before the truthfulness of the girl&rsquo;s  voice, the earnestness of her manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  tell Mr. de Crespigny, or Mrs. Darrell?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course not, my dear. Why should  I tell them anything which concerns you, and that you wish me to keep from them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  promise, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most  certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  give me your solemn promise that you will not tell Mr. de Crespigny, or any member  of his family, the secret which I am going to confide to you; under no circumstances  whatever, will you be tempted to break that promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  Nelly,&rdquo; cried Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;you are as serious as if you were administering some  terrible oath to the neophyte in a political society. I shall not break my promise,  my dear, believe me. My profession has accustomed me to keeping secrets. What is  it, Eleanor; what is this tremendous mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Vane lifted her eyes, and looked full in her lover&rsquo;s face, upon the watch for any  change of expression that might indicate displeasure or contempt. She was very fearful  of losing the lawyer&rsquo;s confidence and esteem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  I went to Hazlewood,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I went in a false name, not at my own wish, but  to please my sister, who did not want Mrs. Darrell to know that any member of her  family could be in a dependent position. My name is not Vincent. I am Eleanor Vane,  the daughter of Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton&rsquo;s astonishment was unbounded. He had heard George Vane&rsquo;s history from Mrs.  Darrell, but he had never heard of the birth of the old man&rsquo;s youngest daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor  Vane,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;then Mrs. Bannister is your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is my half-sister, and it was at her wish that I went to Hazlewood under a false  name. You are not angry with me for having done so, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry  with you? No, my dear, the deception was harmless enough; though it was a piece  of foolish pride upon your sister&rsquo;s part. My Eleanor was in no way degraded by having  to turn her accomplishments to use and profit. My poor self-reliant girl,&rdquo; he added,  tenderly, &ldquo;going out into the world with a secret to keep. But why do you wish this  secret to be still preserved, Eleanor; you are not ashamed of your father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashamed  of his name? Oh, no, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  keep your real name a secret, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  tell you why. But you&rsquo;ll keep your promise. You are too honourable to break your  promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton looked wonderingly at the girl&rsquo;s earnest face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  my dear, I won&rsquo;t break my promise,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand your anxiety  for this concealment. However, we will say nothing more about it, Nelly,&rdquo; he added,  as if in reply to an appealing look from Miss Vane; &ldquo;your name will be Monckton  when you go back to Berkshire; and nobody will dare to question your right to that  name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer put his lips to the girl&rsquo;s forehead, and bade her good night upon the threshold  of the shoemaker&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  bless you, my own darling!&rdquo; he, said in a very low voice, &ldquo;and preserve our faith  in each other. There must be no secrets between you and me, Nelly.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
An Insidious Demon</strong></h2>
<p>On a bright September morning a hired carriage took Miss  Vane and her friends to the quiet old church in Hart Street, Bloomsbury.  There was a little crowd assembled about the door of the shoemaker&rsquo;s dwelling, and  sympathetic spectators were scattered here and there in the mews, for a marriage  is one of those things which the cleverest people can never contrive to keep a secret.</p>
<p>Miss  Eleanor Vane&rsquo;s pale fawn-coloured silk dress, black mantle, and simple white bonnet  did not form the established costume of a bride, but the young lady looked so very  beautiful in her girlish dress and virginal innocence, that more than one of the  lounging grooms who came out of the stables to see her go by to her hired carriage,  confidentially remarked to an acquaintance that he only wished he could get such  a young woman for <em>his</em> missus. Richard Thornton was not in attendance upon  the fair young bride. There was a scene to be painted for Spavin and Cromshaw upon  that particular day which was more important than any scene Dick had ever painted  before. So the young man set out early upon that September bridal morning, after  saluting Eleanor Vane in the most tender and brotherly fashion: but I am sorry to  say that instead of going straight to the Royal Ph&oelig;nix Theatre, Mr. Thornton walked  with a slow and listless gait across Westminster Bridge, then plunged with a sudden  and almost ferocious impetus into the remotest intricacies of Lambeth, scowling  darkly at the street boys who came in his way, skirting the Archbishop&rsquo;s palace,  glowering at the desolation of Vauxhall, and hurrying far away into the solitudes  of Battersea-fields, where he spent the better part of the afternoon in the dreary  parlour of an obscure public-house, drinking adulterated beer and smoking bad tobacco.</p>
<p>The  Signora wore a rustling black silk dress&mdash;Eleanor&rsquo;s present of the previous Christmas&mdash;in  honour of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s wedding; but Eliza Picirillo&rsquo;s heart was sadly divided upon  this quiet bridal day, half rejoicing in Miss Vane&rsquo;s fortune and advancement, half  sorrowful for poor desolate Dick wandering away amongst the swamps by the waterside.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton and his two partners were waiting for the bride in the portico of the church.  The senior partner, an old man with white hair, was to give Eleanor away, and paid  her many appropriate though rather obsolete compliments upon the occasion. Perhaps  it was now for the first time that Miss Vane began to regard the step she was about  to take as one of a somewhat serious and indeed awful nature; perhaps it was now  for the first time that she began to think she had committed a sin in accepting  Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s love so lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  he knew that I did not promise to marry him because I loved him, but because I wanted  to get back to Hazlewood,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>But  presently the grave shadows passed away from her face and a faint blush rose to  her cheek and brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  love him by-and-bye, when I have avenged my father&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Some  such thought as this was in her mind when she took her place beside Gilbert Monckton  at the altar.</p>
<p>The  autumn sunshine streamed in upon them through the great windows of the church, and  wrapped them in yellow light, like the figures of Joseph and Mary in an old picture.  The bride and bridegroom looked very handsome standing side by side in this yellow  sunshine. Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s twenty years&rsquo; seniority only dignified and exalted  him, investing the holy marriage promise of love and protection with a greater solemnity  than it could have had when spoken by a stripling of one or two and twenty.</p>
<p>Everything  seemed auspicious upon this wedding morning. The lawyer&rsquo;s partners were in the highest  spirits, the beadle and pew-opener were elevated by the idea of prospective donations.  The Signora wept quietly while the marriage service was being read, picturing to  herself her nephew Richard, smoking and drinking desperately in his desolate painting-room:  but when the ceremony was over the good music mistress dried her tears, banishing  all traces of sorrow before she kissed and complimented the bride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are to come and see us at the Priory, dear Signora,&rdquo; Eleanor said, as she clung  about her friend before leaving the vestry; &ldquo;Gilbert says so, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  voice faltered a little, and she glanced shyly at her husband as she spoke of him  by his Christian name. It seemed as if she had no right to allude so familiarly  to Mr. Monckton, of Tolldale Priory. And presently Eliza Picirillo stood alone&mdash;or  attended only by the beadle, obsequiously attentive in proportion to the liberality  of the donation he had just received&mdash;under the portico of the Bloomsbury church,  watching the lawyer&rsquo;s carriage drive away towards the Great Northern railway station.  Mr. Monckton, in the absence of any preference upon Eleanor&rsquo;s part, had chosen a  quiet Yorkshire watering-place as the scene of  his honeymoon.</p>
<p>Signora  Picirillo sighed as she went down the steps before the church, and took her seat  in the hired vehicle that was to take her back to the Pilasters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  Bloomsbury has seen the last of Eleanor,&rdquo; she thought,  sadly; &ldquo;we may go down to see her, perhaps, in her grand new house, but she will  never come back to us. She will never wash the tea-things and make tea and toast  again for a tired-out old music mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  low gleams of red and orange in the last sunset of September sank behind the grey  line of the German   Ocean, after the closing day  of Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s honeymoon. Upon the first of October the lawyer was to take  his young wife to Tolldale Priory. Mr. and Mrs. Monckton walked upon the broad sands  as that low orange light faded out of the western sky. The lawyer was grave and  silent, and every now and then cast a furtive glance at his companion&rsquo;s face. Sometimes  that glance was succeeded by a sigh.</p>
<p>Eleanor  was paler and more careworn than she had looked since the day after her visit to  the shipbroker&rsquo;s office. The quiet and seclusion of the place to which Gilbert Monckton  had brought his bride had given her ample opportunity of brooding on the one idea  of her life. Had he plunged her into a vortex of gaiety, it is possible that she  might have been true to that deep-rooted purpose which she had so long nursed in  her breast; but, on the other hand, there would have been some hope that the delights  of change and novelty, delights to which youth cannot be indifferent&mdash;might have  beguiled the bride from that for-ever-recurring train of thought which separated  her from her husband as effectually as if an ocean had rolled between them.</p>
<p>Yes,  Gilbert Monckton had discovered the fatal truth that marriage is not always union,  and that the holiest words that were ever spoken cannot weave the mystic web which  makes two souls indissolubly one, if there be one inharmonious thread in the magical  fabric. Gilbert Monckton felt this, and knew that there was some dissonant note  in the chord which should have been such a melodious unison.</p>
<p>Again  and again, while talking to his wife, carried away, perhaps, by the theme of which  he was speaking, counting on her sympathy as a certainty, he had looked into Eleanor&rsquo;s  face, and seen that her thoughts had wandered far away from him and his conversation,  into some unknown region. He had no clue by which he could follow those wanderings;  no chance word ever fell from his wife&rsquo;s lips which might serve as the traitor silk  that guided ruthless Eleanor to Rosamond&rsquo;s hiding-place. So thus, before the honeymoon  was over, Gilbert Monckton began to be jealous of his bride, thereby fostering for  himself a nest of scorpions, or a very quarry of young vultures, which were henceforth  to make their meals off his entrails.</p>
<p>But  it was not the ferocious or Othello-like jealousy. The green-eyed monster did not  appear under his more rugged and uncivilised form, finding a vent for his passions  in pillows, poison, and poniards. The monster disguised himself as a smooth and  philosophical demon. He hid his diabolical attributes under the gravity and wisdom  of a friendly sage. In other words, Gilbert Monckton, feeling disappointed at the  result of his marriage, set himself to reason upon the fact, and was for ever torturing  himself with silent arguments and mute conjectures as to the cause of that indescribable  something in his young wife&rsquo;s manner which told him there was no perfect union between  them. The lawyer reproached himself for his weak folly in having built a fairy palace  of hope upon the barren fact of Eleanor&rsquo;s acceptance of his hand. Did not girls,  situated as George Vane&rsquo;s daughter had been situated, marry for money, again and  again, in these mercenary days? Who should know this better than Gilbert Monckton  the solicitor, who had drawn up so many marriage settlements, been concerned in  so many divorces, and assisted at so many matrimonial bargains, whose sordid motives  were as undisguised as in any sale of cattle transacted in the purlieus of Smithfield?  Who should know better than he, that beautiful and innocent girls every day bartered  their beauty and innocence for certain considerations set down by grave lawyers,  and engrossed upon sheets of parchment at so much per sheet?</p>
<p>He did  know this, and in his mad arrogance he had said to himself, &ldquo;I&mdash;amongst all other  men&mdash;will be an exception to the common rule. The girl I marry is poor; but she will  give herself to me for no meaner consideration than my love and my truth and my  devotion; and those shall be hers until my dying day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton had said this; and already a mocking demon had made a permanent perch for  himself upon this wretched man&rsquo;s shoulders, for ever whispering insidious doubts  into his ear, for ever instilling shadowy fears into his mind.</p>
<p>Eleanor  had not seemed happy during those few honeymoon weeks. She had grown weary of the  broad sands stretching far away, flat and desolate under the September sky, and  weary of the everlasting and unbroken line that bounded that wide gray sea. This  weariness she had displayed frankly enough; but she had not revealed its hidden  source, which lay in her feverish impatience to go back to the neighbourhood of  Hazlewood, and to make the discovery she wished to make before Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s  death.</p>
<p>She  had sounded her husband upon the subject of the old man&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you think Mr. de Crespigny will live long?&rdquo; she asked, one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven  knows, my dear,&rdquo; the lawyer answered, carelessly. &ldquo;He has been an invalid for nearly  twenty years now, and he may go on being an invalid for twenty years more, perhaps.  I fancy that his death will be very sudden whenever it does happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  do you think that he will leave his money to Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  face grew a little paler as she mentioned the young man&rsquo;s name. The invisible familiar  perched upon Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s shoulder directed the lawyer&rsquo;s attention to that fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know. Why should you be interested in Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s welfare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  not interested in his welfare, I only asked you a question, Gilbert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even  the malice of the familiar could take no objection to the tone in which Eleanor  said this: and Mr. Monckton was ashamed of the passing twinge which Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  name had caused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare  say De Crespigny will leave his money to young Darrell, my dear,&rdquo; he said, in a  more cordial voice; &ldquo;and though I have no very high opinion of the young man&rsquo;s character,  I think he ought to have the fortune. The maiden ladies should have annuities, of  course. Goodness knows they have fought hard enough for the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  can people act so contemptibly for the sake of money!&rdquo; cried Eleanor, with sudden  indignation.</p>
<p>The  lawyer looked admiringly at her glowing face, which had crimsoned with the intensity  of her feeling. She was thinking of her father&rsquo;s death, and of that hundred pounds  which had been won from him on the night of his suicide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  thought Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;she cannot be mercenary. That bright, impulsive creature  could never be guilty of any deliberate meanness,&mdash;and what could be a worse meanness  than that of the woman who could marry a man out of sordid and mercenary motives,  beguiling him by a simulated affection, and thereby compassing her own advancement?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I have won her heart, in its untainted freshness,&rdquo; thought Gilbert Monckton, &ldquo;I  must be content, though that girlish heart may seem cold. She will love me better  by-and-by. She will learn to confide in me; she will learn to sympathise with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By such  arguments as these Mr. Monckton endeavoured to satisfy himself, and sometimes, indeed,  succeeded in doing so,&mdash;that his young wife&rsquo;s absent and thoughtful manner was a  matter of course; the thoughtfulness of a girl unused to her new position, and perhaps  a little bewildered by its strangeness. But on the morning of the 1st of October,  Gilbert Monckton perceived a change in Eleanor&rsquo;s manner, and on that morning the  demon familiar took up a permanent station upon the lawyer&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton was no longer grave and listless. A feverish impatience, a sudden flow  of high spirits, seemed to have taken possession of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  observe,&rdquo; whispered the familiar spirit, as Mr. Monckton sat opposite his wife in  a compartment of the express train that was to take them to London, <em>en route</em> for Berkshire, &ldquo;you observe the  glow in her cheeks, the brightness of her eyes. You saw her turn pale the other  day when she mentioned Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s name. You know what the young man&rsquo;s mother  told you. You can do the commonest sum in logical arithmetic, I suppose. You can  put two and two together. Your wife has been wearied to death of the North, and  the sea, and the sands, and <em>you</em>. She is in high spirits to-day, and it is  very easy to account for the change in her manner. She is glad to go back to Berkshire&mdash;she is glad to go back there, because <em>she will  see Launcelot Darrell.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton, with a cambric handkerchief thrown over his face, kept a covert watch  upon his wife from between its artfully-adjusted folds, and enjoyed such converse  as this with the spirit he had chosen for his companion.</p>

  Slow Fires</strong></h2>
<p>The new life which began for Eleanor Monckton at Tolldale Priory seemed very  strange to her. The prim respectability of the old mansion weighed heavily upon  her spirits. The best part of her existence had been spent in a very free-and-easy  and Bohemian manner; and her improved position was at first more strange than pleasant  to her. The well-trained servants who waited upon her in respectful silence, acknowledging  her as their mistress, and obsequiously eager to give her pleasure, were very different  people to the familiar landladies of those lodgings in which she had lived with  her father, or the good-natured shoemaker-landlord at the Pilasters.</p>
<p>At Hazlewood  she had been only a dependant; and those who served her had given her their service  out of love for her brightness and beauty; rendering her little benefits with frank  smiles and familiar greetings. But the mistress of Tolldale had a certain dignity  to support; and new duties to learn in her new position.</p>
<p>At first  those duties seemed very hard to the impulsive girl, who had a sort of instinctive  contempt for all ceremonial usages and stereotyped observances. They seemed more  especially hard, perhaps, because Gilbert Monckton expected his young wife to assume  her new position as a thing of course, and was inclined to be very jealous of any  omission that derogated from her dignity.</p>
<p>He was  inclined to be jealous of her girlish inconstancy of thought and action, seeing  in all this an evidence that she regretted the freedom of her girlhood. He was inclined  to be jealous. That one sentence reveals the secret of a great deal of misery which  this gentleman made for himself. He was inclined to be jealous of anything and everything,  where his young wife was concerned.</p>
<p>It was  thus that Gilbert Monckton began his married life. It was thus that, of his own  doing, he set a breach between himself and the woman he idolised. And when the breach  was made, and the dreary gulf of distrust and misapprehension stretched black and  impassable between this weak man and that which he loved dearest in all the world,  he could only cast himself down beside the yawning ravine and bemoan his desolation.</p>
<p>I have  called Gilbert Monckton a weak man advisedly. In all the ordinary business of life,  and in all the extraordinary businesses that fell in his professional pathway, the  lawyer&rsquo;s clearness of perception and power of intellect were unsurpassed by any  of his compeers. Strong; stern; decided and unyielding, where his judgment was once  formed; he was trusted as an oracle by those who had dealings with him. But in his  love for his wife he was weaker and more irresolute than any desponding swain of  five-and-twenty.</p>
<p>He had  been deceived once by a woman whom he had loved as he now loved Eleanor; and he  could not forget that early deception. The shadow that had fallen upon his life  was not to be lifted off by any sunshine of trust and love. He had been deceived  once, and he might be deceived again.</p>
<p>The  wrong which a woman&rsquo;s falsehood does to the man whom she betrays is a lasting and  sometimes irrecoverable wrong. The wound festers, deep down below the outer scar;  and while sympathetic friends are rejoicing in the slow obliteration of that surface  evidence of the past, the poison&rsquo;s corroding power still endures, gaining force  by time.</p>
<p>The  secret sorrow of Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s youth had made him suspicious of all womanly  truth and purity. He watched his wife, as it had been his habit to watch his ward,  doubtfully and fearfully: even when he most admired her, regarding her in some wise  as a capricious and irresponsible being, who might at any moment turn upon him and  betray him.</p>
<p>He had  fought against his love for his ward&rsquo;s beautiful companion. He had tried to shut  his mind against all consciousness of her fascinations; he had endeavoured not to  believe in her. If she had stayed at Hazlewood, that silent struggle might have  gone on in the lawyer&rsquo;s breast for years; but her sudden departure had taken the  grave man of forty off his guard: hurried away by an impulse, he had revealed the  secret that had been so skilfully repressed, and, for the second time in his life,  perilled his happiness upon the hazard of a woman&rsquo;s truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do I know of her more than I knew of Margaret Ravenshaw?&rdquo; he thought, sometimes;  &ldquo;can I trust her because she looks full in my face, with eyes that are as clear  as the sky above my head? There is generally some landmark by which a man&rsquo;s character  can be understood, however practised he may be in hypocrisy; but a woman&mdash;&mdash; Bah! a woman&rsquo;s  beauty defies a physiognomist. We trust and believe because we admire. &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t  be wicked with such a Grecian nose,&rsquo; we say. &lsquo;Those exquisitely-moulded lips cannot  speak anything but the truth!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Gilbert  Monckton&rsquo;s young wife had seemed happy in her new home, he would have accepted the  fair omen, and would have sunned himself in the brightness of her gaiety. But she  was not happy; he could clearly see that; and day and night he tormented himself  with vain endeavours to find out the cause of her uncertain spirits, her fits of  abstraction, her long pauses of thoughtful silence.</p>
<p>And  while Mrs. Monckton&rsquo;s husband was nursing all these tortures, and every day widening  the gulf of his own making, his wife, absorbed by her own secret purpose, was almost  unconscious of all else in the world. If she saw the lawyer&rsquo;s face thoughtful or  gloomy, she concluded that his moodiness arose from business anxieties with which  she had no concern. If he sighed, she set down his melancholy to the same professional  causes. A tiresome will-case, a troublesome chancery suit&mdash;something in those dusty  offices had annoyed him; and that professional something had of course no concern  for her.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton had taken upon herself an unnatural office; she had assumed an abnormal  duty; and her whole life fashioned itself to fit that unwomanly purpose. She abnegated  the privileges, and left unperformed the duties of a wife&mdash;true to nothing except  to that fatal promise made in the first madness of her grief for George Vane&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>She  had been more than a week at Tolldale Priory, and she had not advanced one step  upon the road which she had so desperately determined to pursue. She had not yet  seen Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton had spent the day after his return to Berkshire  in riding about the neighbourhood, calling upon those few people with whom he kept  up any acquaintance, and informing them of his marriage with the young lady who,  a few weeks before, had been the companion of his ward. Of course he received friendly  congratulations and good wishes from every one to whom he imparted this intelligence;  and of course when his back was turned, the same people who had tendered those good  wishes set to work to wonder at his folly, and to prognosticate all manner of evil  from his absurd and imprudent marriage.</p>
<p>His  longest visit was paid to Hazlewood, and here his tidings afforded real and unmixed  satisfaction. Launcelot Darrell was at work in his painting-room, and was therefore  out of the way of hearing the news. The widow was pleased to think that Eleanor&rsquo;s  marriage would secure her son against the immediate danger of taking a penniless  wife; and Laura was sincerely rejoiced at the idea of seeing her friend again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may  come to Tolldale soon, mayn&rsquo;t I, Mr. Monckton?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Dear Nelly, I do so  long to see her! But to think of her being married to you! I never was so surprised  in my life. Why you must be old enough to be her father. It does seem so funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton did not feel particularly grateful to his ward for the extreme candour  of these remarks, but he invited the young lady to spend the following day with  Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall  be in town to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I dare say Mrs. Monckton will find the Priory  dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Monckton!&rdquo; cried Laura; &ldquo;oh, to be sure; why, that&rsquo;s Nelly, of course! Find the  Priory dull? Yes, I should think she would indeed! Poor Eleanor, in those damp,  over-grown gardens, with the high walls all round, and the tops of the trees above  the walls. How lonely she&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonely!  I shall come home to dinner every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  at seven o&rsquo;clock; and from breakfast-time till seven poor Nell must amuse herself  in the best way she can. But I&rsquo;m not going to grumble; I&rsquo;m only too happy to think  she will be near me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton stood by the garden-gate&mdash;that gate near which he had so often loitered  with Eleanor&mdash;listening with no very great satisfaction to his ward&rsquo;s frivolous prattle.  His young wife would feel unhappy in the dulness of her new life, perhaps. If that  were to be so, it would be proof positive that she did not love him. He could never  have felt dull or lonely in her society, though Tolldale had been some grim and  isolated habitation in the middle of an African desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  you think she will be dull, Laura?&rdquo; he said, rather despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why <em>of course</em> she will,&rdquo; answered the young lady; &ldquo;but now don&rsquo;t think me inquisitive,  please,&rdquo; she added, in a very insinuating tone, &ldquo;but I do <em>so</em> much want you  to tell me something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  want me to tell you what?&rdquo; asked the lawyer, rather sharply.</p>
<p>Laura  linked her hand through his arm, and raising herself on tip-toe, so as to bring  her rosy lips within easier reach of his ear, whispered archly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does  she <em>really</em> love you? Was it <em>really</em> a love-match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton started as violently as if that infantine whisper had been the envenomed  hiss of a snake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, child?&rdquo; he said, turning sharply upon his ward; &ldquo;of course Eleanor  and I married because we loved each other? Why else should we have married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  to be sure. Girls marry for money sometimes. I heard Mrs. Darrell say that one of  the Penwoods, of Windsor,  married a horrid, old, rich city man for the sake of his money. But I don&rsquo;t think  Eleanor would do that sort of thing. Only it seems so funny that she should have  been in love with you all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  what time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  all the time she and I were together. How could she help talking of you, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer bit his lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  never talked of me, then?&rdquo; he said, with a feeble attempt to make his tone careless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, she spoke of you sometimes, of course; but not in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  in what way? When will you learn to express yourself clearly, Miss Mason? Are you  going to be a child all your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton&rsquo;s ward looked up at him with a half comic look of terror. He was not accustomed  to speak so sharply to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be angry, please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know I don&rsquo;t always express myself clearly. I dare  say it&rsquo;s because I used to get other girls to do my themes&mdash;they call exercises in  composition themes, you know&mdash;when I was at school. I mean that Eleanor didn&rsquo;t talk  of you as if she was in love with you&mdash;not as I talk&mdash;not as I <em>should</em> talk  of any one if I were in love with them,&rdquo; added the young lady, blushing very much  as she corrected herself.</p>
<p>Miss  Mason had only one idea of the outer evidences of the master-passion. A secret or  unrequited affection which did not make itself known by copious quotations of Percy  Shelley and Letitia Landon, was in her mind a very common-place affair.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  set you up as a judge of how a woman should speak of a man she loves?&rdquo; he said,  sharply. &ldquo;My wife has too much modesty to advertise her affection for any man. By-the-bye,  Miss Mason, would you like to come and live at Tolldale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura  looked at her guardian with unmitigated surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  and live at Tolldale!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t like me; I thought you despised  me because I&rsquo;m so frivolous and childish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despise  you, Laura,&rdquo; cried Gilbert Monckton, &ldquo;not like you! My poor dear child, what a brute  I must have been if I ever have given you such an impression as that. I am very  fond of you, my dear,&rdquo; he added, gravely, laying his hand upon the girl&rsquo;s head as  he spoke, and looking down at her with sorrowful tenderness. &ldquo;I am very much attached  to you, my poor dear child. If I ever seem vexed with your girlish frivolity, it  is only because I am anxious about your future. I am very, very anxious about your  future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  why are you so anxious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  your mother was childish and light-hearted like you, Laura, and her life was not  a happy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  poor mother. Ah, how I wish you would tell me about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura  Mason looked very serious as she said this. Her hands were folded round the lawyer&rsquo;s  arm, her bright blue eyes seemed to grow of a more sombre colour as she looked earnestly  upward to his grave face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  now, my dear; some day, some day, perhaps, we&rsquo;ll talk about all that. But not now.  You haven&rsquo;t answered my question, Laura. Would you like to live at Tolldale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young lady blushed crimson and dropped her eyelids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should dearly like to live with Eleanor,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think it would be quite right to leave Mrs. Darrell, would it? The money you pay  her is of great use to her, you know; I have heard her say she could scarcely get  on without it, especially now that Launcelot&mdash;now that Mr. Darrell has come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  blushes deepened as Laura Mason said this.</p>
<p>The  lawyer watched those deepening blushes with considerable uneasiness. &ldquo;She is in  love with this dark-eyed young Apollo,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are very scrupulous about Mrs. Darrell and her convenience, Laura,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I  should have fancied you would have been delighted to live with your old friend and  companion. You&rsquo;ll come to-morrow to spend the day with Eleanor, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  send the carriage for you, after it has taken me to Slough.  Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton rode slowly homewards. His interview with Laura had not been altogether  agreeable to him. The girl&rsquo;s surprise at his marriage with Eleanor had irritated  and disturbed him. It seemed like a protest against the twenty years that divided  his age from that of his young wife. There was something abnormal and exceptionable  in the marriage, it seemed, then; and the people who had congratulated him and wished  him well, were so many bland and conventional hypocrites, who no doubt laughed in  their sleeves at his folly.</p>
<p>The  lawyer rode back to Tolldale Priory with a moody and overclouded brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  girl is in love with Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She betrayed her secret in  her childish transparence. The young man must be wonderfully attractive, since people  fall in love with him in this manner. I don&rsquo;t like him; I don&rsquo;t believe in him;  I should not like Laura to be his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet  in the next moment Mr. Monckton reflected that, after all, a marriage between his  ward and Launcelot might not be altogether unadvisable. The young man was clever  and gentlemanly. He came of a good stock, and had at least brilliant expectations.  He might marry Laura and go to Italy,  where he could devote a few years to the cultivation of his art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  the poor child is really very much in love with him, and he returns her affection,  it would be cruel to come between them with any prudential tyranny,&rdquo; thought Mr.  Monckton. &ldquo;The young man seems really anxious to achieve success as an artist, and  if he is to do so he ought certainly to study abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer&rsquo;s mind dwelt upon this latter point throughout the remainder of his ride,  and when he crossed the stone-paved hall where the cavalier&rsquo;s boots and saddles  hung in the mysterious coloured light that stole through the emblazoned windows,  he had almost come to the determination that Laura Mason and Launcelot Darrell ought  to be married forthwith. He found his wife sitting in one of the windows of the  library, with her hands lying idle in her lap, and her eyes fixed upon the garden  before her. She started as he entered the room, and looked up at him with a bright  eagerness in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have been to Hazlewood?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have just come from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you have seen&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  stopped suddenly. Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s name had risen to her lips, but she checked  herself before uttering it, lest she should betray her eager interest in him. She  had no fear of that interest being misconstrued; no idea of such a possibility had  ever entered her head. She only feared that some chance look or word might betray  her vengeful hatred of the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  saw Laura&mdash;and&mdash;and Mrs. Darrell, I suppose?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I saw Laura and Mrs. Darrell,&rdquo; answered Gilbert Monckton, watching his wife&rsquo;s face.  He had perceived the hesitation with which she had asked this question. He saw now  that she was disappointed in his reply.</p>
<p>Eleanor  was incapable of dissimulation, and her disappointment betrayed itself in her face.  She had expected to hear something of Launcelot Darrell, something which would have  at least given her an excuse for questioning her husband about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  did not see Mr. Darrell, then?&rdquo; she said, after a pause, during which Mr. Monckton  had placed himself opposite to her in the open window. The afternoon sunshine fell  full upon Eleanor&rsquo;s face; lighting up every change of expression; revealing every  varying shade of thought that betrayed itself unconsciously in a countenance whose  mobility was one of its greatest charms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Darrell was in his painting-room; I did not see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was a pause. Eleanor was silent, scarcely knowing how to fashion any question that  might lead to her gaining some information about the man whose secrets she had set  herself to unravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you know, Eleanor,&rdquo; said the lawyer after this pause, during which he had kept close  watch upon his wife&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I think I have discovered a secret that concerns Launcelot  Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudden  blushes lit up Eleanor Monckton&rsquo;s cheeks like a flaming fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret!&rdquo;  she repeated. &ldquo;You have found out a secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I believe that my ward, Laura Mason, has fallen in love with the young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  face changed. Her feverish eagerness gave place to a look of indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  that all?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She  had no very great belief in the intensity of Miss Mason&rsquo;s feelings. The girl&rsquo;s sentimental  talk and demonstrative admiration had to her mind something spurious in their nature;  Mrs. Monckton was ready to love Laura very dearly when the business of her life  should be done, and she could have time to love anybody, but in the meantime she  gave herself no uneasiness about Miss Mason&rsquo;s romantic passion for the young painter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura  is as inconstant as the wind,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;She will hate Launcelot Darrell when  I tell her how base he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  what was Eleanor&rsquo;s surprise when Mr. Monckton said, very quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  the girl is really attached to this young man, and he returns her affection&mdash;she  is so pretty and fascinating, that I should think he could scarcely help being in  love with her&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see why the match should not take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked up suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, no, no,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you would never let Laura marry Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  why not, Mrs. Monckton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  insidious imp which the lawyer had made his bosom companion of late, at this moment  transformed itself into a raging demon, and gnawed ravenously at the vitals of its  master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  shouldn&rsquo;t Laura marry Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  you have a bad opinion of him. What did you say to me by the garden-gate at Hazlewood,  when Mr. Darrell first came home? You said he was selfish, shallow, frivolous; false,  perhaps. You said there was a secret in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought  so then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  have you ceased to think so now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know. I may have been prejudiced against the young man,&rdquo; answered Mr. Monckton,  doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think you were,&rdquo; Eleanor said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he is a good man. Pray, pray don&rsquo;t  let Laura marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  clasped her hands in her eagerness, as she looked up in her husband&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton&rsquo;s brow darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  does it matter to you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked surprised at the almost angry abruptness of her husband&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  matters a great deal to me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I should be very sorry if Laura were to  make an unhappy marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  must her marriage with Launcelot Darrell be necessarily unhappy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  because he is a bad man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  right have you to say that, unless you have some special reason for thinking it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  a special reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot  tell you&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ravenous demon&rsquo;s tooth grew sharper than usual when Eleanor said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Monckton,&rdquo; the lawyer said, sternly, &ldquo;I am afraid that there can be very little  happiness in store for you and me if you begin your married life by keeping secrets  from your husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton was too proud to say more than this. A dull despair was creeping into his  breast, a sick loathing of himself and of his folly. Every one of those twenty years  which made him his young wife&rsquo;s senior rose up against him, and gibed and twitted  him.</p>
<p>What  right had he to marry a young wife, and believe that she could love him? What justification  could he find for his own folly in taking this girl from poverty and obscurity,  and then expecting that she should feel any warmer sentiment than some feeble gratitude  to him for having given her an advantageous bargain? He had given her a handsome  house and attentive servants, carriages and horses, prosperity and independence,  in exchange for her bright youth and beauty, and he was angry with her because she  did not love him.</p>
<p>Looking  back at that interview in the Pilasters&mdash;every circumstance of which was very clear  to him now, by the aid of a pair of spectacles lent him by the jealous demon his  familiar&mdash;Mr. Monckton remembered that no confession of love had dropped from Eleanor&rsquo;s  lips. She had consented to become his wife, nothing more. She had, no doubt&mdash;in those  moments of maidenly hesitation, during which he had waited so breathlessly&mdash;deliberately  weighed and carefully balanced the advantages that were to be won from the sacrifice  demanded of her.</p>
<p>Of course  the perpetual brooding upon such fancies as these very much tended to make Gilbert  Monckton an agreeable and lively companion for an impulsive girl. There is something  remarkable in the persistency with which the sufferer from that terrible disease  called jealousy strives to aggravate the causes of his torture.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>

<p>Laura Mason came to live at Tolldale. Gilbert Monckton argued with  himself that his most reasonable motive for marrying Eleanor Vane had lain in his  desire to provide a secure home and suitable companionship for his ward. The girl  was very glad to be with Eleanor; but a little sorry to leave Hazlewood, now that  Mr. Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s presence gave a new charm to the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  that he is very lively, you know, Nelly,&rdquo; Miss Mason remarked to her guardian&rsquo;s  wife in the course of a long discussion of Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s merits. &ldquo;He never seems  happy. He&rsquo;s always roaming about the place, looking as if he had something upon  his mind. It makes him look very handsome, though, you know; I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d  look half so handsome if he hadn&rsquo;t anything on his mind. He was awfully dull and  gloomy after you went away, Nell; I&rsquo;m sure he must have been in love with you. Mrs.  Darrell says he wasn&rsquo;t; and that he admires another person; quite a different person.  Do you think I&rsquo;m the person, Eleanor dear?&rdquo; asked the young lady, blushing and smiling,  as she looked shyly up at her companion&rsquo;s grave face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know, Laura; but I almost hope not, for I should be very sorry if you were to marry  Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; Eleanor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  why should you be sorry, Nelly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason pouted her under lip and shrugged her shoulders, with the prettiest air of  impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very unkind of you to say so, Nell,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s good! Or if he  isn&rsquo;t good, I like him all the better for it,&rdquo; she added, with charming inconsistency.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to marry a good man, like my guardian, or Mr. Neate, the curate of  Hazlewood parish. The Corsair wasn&rsquo;t good; but see how fond Gulnare and Medora were  of him. I don&rsquo;t suppose it was good of the Giaour to kill Hassan; but who could  have had the heart to refuse to marry the Giaour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton did not attempt to argue with a young lady who expressed such opinions  as these. Laura&rsquo;s romantic infatuation only made Eleanor more impatient for the  coming of that hour in which she should be able to denounce Launcelot Darrell as  a cheat and a traitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  shall be disinherited, and through me,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He shall be cast off by the  woman who has loved him, and through me. And when he suffers most, I will be as  pitiless to his sufferings, as he was pitiless to the old man whom he cheated and  abandoned to despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fortnight  passed after Eleanor&rsquo;s arrival at the Priory before she had any opportunity of seeing  Launcelot Darrell. She had proposed going to Hazlewood several times, but upon each  occasion Mr. Monckton had contrived to interpose some objection to her visit. She  began to despair of entering upon the silent struggle with her father&rsquo;s destroyer.  It seemed as if she had come to Tolldale for no purpose. In her impatience she dreaded  that Maurice de Crespigny would die, leaving his fortune to his nephew. She knew  that the old man&rsquo;s life hung by a slender thread, which at any moment might be severed.</p>
<p>But  at last the opportunity she had so anxiously awaited arrived unexpectedly, not brought  about by any scheming or foresight upon her part. Laura had been a few days at the  Priory, and the two girls were walking in one of the sheltered pathways of the old-fashioned  garden, waiting for Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s arrival, and the clanging summons of the  great dinner-bell.</p>
<p>The  October sunshine was bright and pleasant, the autumn flowers enlivened the dark  luxuriance of the garden with their gaudy splendour. The tall hollyhocks waved in  the breeze.</p>
<p>The  two girls had walked up and down the smooth gravel path for some time in silence.  Eleanor was absorbed in her own thoughts, and even Laura could not talk for ever  without encouragement.</p>
<p>But  presently this latter young lady stopped with a blush and a start, clasping her  hand tightly about her companion&rsquo;s wrist. At the other end of the sheltered walk,  amongst the flickering patches of sunshine that trembled on the filbert-trees, she  had perceived Launcelot Darrell advancing towards them.</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is the matter, Laura?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>In the  next moment she recognised Mr. Darrell. The chance had come at last.</p>
<p>The  young man advanced to meet Mrs. Monckton and her companion. He was pale, and had  a certain gravity in his face expressive of some hidden sorrow. He had been in love  with Eleanor Vane, after his own fashion, and was very much disposed to resent her  desertion of him. His mother had told him the reason of that desertion very frankly,  after Eleanor&rsquo;s marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come  to offer you my congratulations, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; he said, in a tone which was intended  to wound the young wife to the quick, but which, like everything else about this  young man, had a certain spuriousness, a tone of melodrama that robbed it of all  force. &ldquo;I should have accompanied my mother when she called on you the other day&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused  abruptly, looking at Laura with an air of ill-concealed vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can  I speak to you alone, Mrs. Monckton?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;I have something particular to  say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you can say it before Laura, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  not before Laura, or before any one. I must speak to you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason looked at the object of her admiration with a piteous expression in her childish  face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  cruel he is to me,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I do believe he is in love with Eleanor. How wicked  of him to be in love with my guardian&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton did not attempt to refuse the privilege which the young man demanded of  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  quite willing to hear anything you may have to say to me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well!&rdquo; cried Laura. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll go away if you want to talk about secrets  that I musn&rsquo;t hear. Only I don&rsquo;t see how you can have any secrets. You haven&rsquo;t known  Mr. Darrell a day longer than I have, Eleanor, and I can&rsquo;t imagine what he can have  to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After  this protest Miss Mason turned her back upon her companions, and ran away towards  the house. She shed a few silent tears behind the shelter of a great clump of chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t care for me a bit,&rdquo; she muttered, as she dried her eyes; &ldquo;Mrs. Darrell is  a wicked old storyteller. I feel just as poor Gulnare must have felt when the Corsair  was so rude to her, after she&rsquo;d committed a murder for his sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  and Launcelot left the sheltered pathway, and walked slowly across the broad lawn  towards an old sundial, quaint in shape, and covered with the moss that had slowly  crept over the gray stonework. Here the young man stopped, lounging against the  mossgrown pedestal and resting his elbow upon the broken dial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  come here to-day to tell you that you have treated me very ill, Eleanor Monckton,&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>The  young wife drew herself up proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean  that you jilted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jilted  you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  You played fast and loose with me. You listened to my declaration of love. You suffered  me to believe that you loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.  Darrell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  did more, Eleanor,&rdquo; cried the young man, passionately; &ldquo;you <em>did</em> love me.  This marriage with Gilbert Monckton, a man twenty years your senior, is a marriage  prompted by base and mercenary motives. You loved me, Eleanor; your silence admitted  it that day, if your words did not. You had no right to be cajoled by my mother;  you had no right to leave Hazlewood without a word of explanation to me. You are  falsehearted and mercenary, Mrs. Monckton; and you have married this man here because  he is the owner of a fine house, and can give you money to spend upon your womanly  caprices&mdash;your selfish vanities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed  scornfully to her silk dress as he spoke, and to the golden trinkets that glittered  at her waist.</p>
<p>She  looked at him with a strange expression in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think  of me as you please,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;think that I was in love with you, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  as if she had said to him, &ldquo;Fall into a trap of your own setting, if you please.  I am not base enough to lay such a snare for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Eleanor, you were false and mercenary. You were foolish, perhaps, as well; for I  may be a rich man before very long. I may be master of the Woodlands property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think you ever will inherit that fortune,&rdquo; Eleanor said, slowly. &ldquo;You talk of my  being base and mercenary; you are at liberty to think so if you please. But have <em>you</em> never done base things for the sake of money, Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man&rsquo;s face darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody  is immaculate, I dare say,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have been very poor, and have been obliged  to do what the rest of the world does when its purse is empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Eleanor  watched his moody face she suddenly remembered that this was not the way her cards  must be played. The task which she had set herself to perform was not to be accomplished  by candour and openness. This man had betrayed her father, and she must betray him.</p>
<p>She  held out her hand to Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  us be friends,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I wish to be friends with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  were two witnesses looking on at this gesture. Laura Mason was standing by her guardian,  watching the group beside the sundial. Gilbert Monckton had returned from town,  and had come into the garden in search of his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  sent me away from them,&rdquo; Laura said, as her guardian looked at Launcelot and Eleanor.  &ldquo;He had something particular to say to her; so I wasn&rsquo;t to hear it, and they sent  me away. You&rsquo;ll ask him to dinner, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  answered the lawyer, sharply.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell held Eleanor&rsquo;s hand some moments before he released it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish  to be friends with you, Mr. Darrell,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to Hazlewood to-morrow  to see your pictures, if you please. I want to see how the Rosalind and Celia goes  on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  hated herself for her hypocrisy. Every generous impulse of her soul revolted against  her falsehood. But these things were only a natural part of the unnatural task which  she had set herself to perform.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
  Keeping Watch</strong></h2>
<p>Two pair of jealous eyes kept constant watch upon Eleanor Monckton, for some  time after that October afternoon on which the lawyer and Miss Mason had stood side  by side, looking at the two figures by the sun-dial.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton was too proud to complain. He laid down the fair hopes of his manhood in  the grave that already held the broken dreams of his youth. He bowed his head, and  resigned himself to his fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  mistaken,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;it was too preposterous to suppose that at forty I could  win the love of a girl of eighteen. My wife is good and true, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  what? Could this girl be good and true? Had she not deceived her lover most cruelly,  most deliberately, in her declaration of utter indifference towards Launcelot Darrell?</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton remembered her very words, her sudden look of astonishment, her almost  shuddering gesture of surprise, as he asked the important question&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you do not love Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love  him! oh, no, no, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  in spite of this emphatic denial, Mrs. Monckton had, ever since her arrival at Tolldale  Priory, betrayed an intense, an almost feverish interest in the young scapegrace  artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  she is capable of falsehood,&rdquo; thought the lawyer, &ldquo;there must surely be no truth  upon this earth. Shall I trust her, and wait patiently for the solution of the mystery?  No; between man and wife there should be no mystery! She has no right to keep any  secret from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mr.  Monckton hardened his heart against his beautiful young wife, and set himself sternly  and indefatigably to watch her every look, to listen to every intonation of her  voice, to keep a rigorous guard over his own honour and dignity.</p>
<p>Poor  Eleanor was too innocent to read all these signs aright; she only thought that her  husband was changed; that this stern and gloomy companion was not the same Gilbert  Monckton whom she had known at Hazlewood; not the patient &ldquo;guide, philosopher, and  friend,&rdquo; whose subdued bass voice, eloquent in the dusky evenings, long ago&mdash;a year  is very long to a girl of eighteen&mdash;in Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s simple drawing-room, had seemed  a kind of intellectual music to her.</p>
<p>Had  she not been absorbed always by that one thought, whose intensity had reduced the  compass of her mind to a monotone, the young wife would have very bitterly felt  this change in her husband. As it was, she looked upon her disappointment as something  very far away from her; something to be considered and regretted by-and-by; by-and-by,  when the grand business of her life was done.</p>
<p>But  while the gulf between the young wife and her husband every day grew wider, this  grand business made no progress. Day after day, week after week, passed by, and  Eleanor Monckton found herself no nearer the end.</p>
<p>She  had paid several visits to Hazlewood; she had acted her part to the best of her  abilities, which were very mediocre in all matters where deception is necessary;  she had watched and questioned Launcelot Darrell; but she had obtained no vestige  of proof which she might set before Maurice de Crespigny when she denounced his  niece&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>No:  whatever secrets were hidden in the young man&rsquo;s breast, he was so guarded as to  baffle Eleanor Monckton at every point. He was so thoroughly self-possessed as to  avoid betraying himself by so much as a look or a tone.</p>
<p>He was,  however, thrown a good deal in Eleanor&rsquo;s society; for Mr. Monckton, with a strange  persistance, encouraged the penniless artist&rsquo;s attentions to Laura Mason: while  Launcelot Darrell, too shallow to hold long to any infatuation, influenced upon  one side by his mother, and flattered upon the other by Laura&rsquo;s unconcealed admiration,  was content, by-and-by, to lay down his allegiance at this new shrine, and to forgive  Mrs. Monckton for her desertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor  and my mother were both right, I dare say,&rdquo; the young man reflected, contemplating  his fate with a feeling of despondent languor. &ldquo;They were wiser than me, I dare  say. I ought to marry a rich woman. I could never drag out an existence of poverty.  Bachelor poverty is bad enough, but, at least, there&rsquo;s something artistic and Bohemian  about that. Chambertin one day, and vin ordinaire the next; Veuve Cliquot at the  Trois Fr&egrave;res or the Caf&eacute; de Paris  to-night, and small beer in a garret to-morrow morning. But married poverty, squalid  desolation, instead of reckless gaiety; a sick wife and lean hungry children, and  the husband carrying wet canvasses to the pawnbroker! Bah! Eleanor was right; she  has done a good thing for herself; and I&rsquo;d better go in and win the heiress, and  make myself secure against any caprice of my worthy great-uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  thus that Launcelot Darrell became a frequent visitor at Tolldale Priory, and as,  at about this time, Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s business became so unimportant as to be easily  flung entirely into the hands of the two junior partners, the lawyer was almost  always at home to receive his guest.</p>
<p>Nothing  could have been more antagonistic than the characters of the two men. There was  no possibility of sympathy or assimilation between them. The weakness of one was  rendered more evident by the strength of the other. The decided character of the  lawyer seemed harsh and rigid when contrasted with the easy-going, languid good-nature  of the artist.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton, perceiving this wide difference between the two men, admired her husband  as much as she despised Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>If the  lawyer could have known this,&mdash;if he could have known that when his wife&rsquo;s earnest  eyes followed every change of expression in the young man&rsquo;s face, when she listened  most intently to his careless and rambling, yet sometimes almost brilliant talk,  she read his shallow nature and its worthlessness better than that nature had ever  yet been read by the closest observer,&mdash;if Gilbert Monckton could have understood  these things, what wasted agonies, what futile tortures, might have been spared  him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  would have become of me if I had loved this man?&rdquo; Eleanor thought, as day by day,  with an intellect rendered preternaturally clear by the intensity of her one desire,  she grew more familiar with Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>In the  meanwhile, Laura Mason walked along a pathway of roses, whose only thorns were those  jealous twinges which the young lady experienced on account of Eleanor Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  loved her first,&rdquo; the heiress thought, despondently, &ldquo;I know he did, and he made  her an offer upon the day the dressmaker brought home my blue silk, and it was so  short-waisted I was obliged to make her take it back for alteration. And that was  why she&mdash;I mean Eleanor, not the dressmaker&mdash;left Hazlewood. And it&rsquo;s not pleasant  to think that the man one idolises has idolised somebody else not three months before  he proposes to one; and I don&rsquo;t think it was right of Eleanor to lead him on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  by this latter very vague phrase that Miss Mason was in the habit of excusing her  lover&rsquo;s delinquency. Eleanor had led him on; and he was thereby in a manner justified  for that brief infatuation which had beguiled him from poor Laura. In what this  &ldquo;leading on&rdquo; had consisted the young lady did not seek to understand. She wanted  to forgive her lover, and she wanted reasons for her forgiveness; as weak women  do when they deliver themselves up to the bondage of a sentimental affection for  a handsome face. But although Launcelot Darrell had made his peace with Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s  ward, wooing her with a great many tender words and pretty stereotyped phrases under  the gloomy shadow of the yew trees in the old-fashioned priory garden, and although  he had formally demanded her hand, and had been accepted by her guardian and herself,  Laura was not yet quite satisfied. Some lingering sentiment of distrust still held  its place in her breast, and the jealous twinges, which, as I have said, constituted  the thorns upon her rose-bestrewn pathway, were very sharp and numerous.</p>
<p>Nor  was Mr. Monckton wholly free from anxiety on his ward&rsquo;s account. He had consented  to her engagement with Launcelot Darrell. He had done even more; he had encouraged  the young man&rsquo;s suit, and now that it was too late to undo his work, he began to  argue with himself as to the wisdom of his conduct.</p>
<p>He tried  to palter with his conscience; but he could not disguise from himself that the leading  motive which had induced him to consent to his ward&rsquo;s engagement was his desire  to remove Launcelot Darrell out of the society of his wife. He could not be so blind  to his own weakness as to be unaware of the secret pleasure he felt in being able  to demonstrate to Eleanor the worthlessness of an affection which could be so easily  transferred from one object to another.</p>
<p>Apart  from this, Gilbert Monckton tried to believe that he had taken the best course within  his power of choice, for the frivolous girl whom it was his duty to protect. To  have opposed Laura&rsquo;s attachment would have been to cause her great unhappiness.  The young man was clever and agreeable. He was the descendant of a race which was  almost noble by right of its origin. His character would grow stronger with time,  and it would be the guardian&rsquo;s duty to foster all that was good in the nature of  his ward&rsquo;s husband; and to put him in a fair way of occupying an honourable position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  try and develope his talent&mdash;his genius, perhaps,&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton thought; &ldquo;he  shall go to Italy,  and study the old masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it  was settled that the marriage should take place early in the spring, and that Launcelot  and his wife should start immediately afterwards upon a tour through the great art  cities of the continent. It was arranged that they should remain away for at least  a twelvemonth, and that they should spend the winter in Rome.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton grew deathly pale when her husband announced to her the probable date of  the marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  soon!&rdquo; she said, in a low, half-stifled voice. &ldquo;So soon! why December has already  begun&mdash;the spring will be here directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton watched her face with a thoughtful frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is there to wait for?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Eleanor  was silent for a few moments. What could she say? Could she suffer this engagement  to continue? Could she allow Launcelot Darrell to hold his place amongst these people  who so ignorantly trusted in him? She would have spoken, perhaps, and confided at  least some part of her secret to her husband, but she refrained from doing so: for  might not he too laugh at her, as Richard Thornton had done? Might not he, who had  grown lately cold and reserved in his manner towards her, sometimes even sarcastic  and severe&mdash;might not he sternly reprobate her mad desire for vengeance, and in some  manner or other frustrate the great purpose of her life?</p>
<p>She  had trusted Richard Thornton, and had implored his help. No good had ever come of  that confidence: nothing but remonstrances, reproaches, entreaties; even ridicule.  Why, then, should she trust any one else? No, she was resolved henceforward to hold  her secret in her own keeping, and to look to herself alone for victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  should the marriage be delayed?&rdquo; Mr. Monckton demanded, rather sharply, for the  second time, &ldquo;is there any reason for delay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Eleanor faltered, &ldquo;not if you think Mr. Darrell worthy of Laura&rsquo;s confidence; not  if you think him a good man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you any reason to think otherwise of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton evaded a direct answer to this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was you who first taught me to doubt him,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;  answered her husband, &ldquo;I had quite forgotten that. I wonder, Eleanor, that you should  appear so much interested in this young man, since you have so bad an opinion of  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton left the room after launching this dart at the breast which he believed  was guilty of hiding from him a secret regard for another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  help her, poor child!&rdquo; thought the lawyer, &ldquo;she married me for my position; and  perhaps thought that it would be an easy thing to conquer some slight sentimental  predilection for Launcelot Darrell. She tries to do her duty, I believe; and when  this young man is safely out of the way she may learn to love me, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such  reflections as these were generally followed by a change in the lawyer&rsquo;s manner,  and Eleanor&rsquo;s failing spirits revived in the new sunshine of his affection. George  Vane&rsquo;s daughter had already learned to love her husband. No difficult task lay before  her; there was no sentiment of repulsion or dislike to be overcome. She had respected  and admired Gilbert Monckton from the hour of her meeting with him at the Great  Western Terminus; and she was ready to love him truly and cordially whenever she  could succeed in her great purpose, and disengage her mind from its one absorbing  idea.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
  An Old Man&rsquo;s Fancy</strong></h2>
<p>Although Eleanor Monckton&rsquo;s utmost watchfulness revealed to her  nothing that could be twisted into a proof of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s identity with  the man who had been the indirect cause of her father&rsquo;s death, she made some progress  in another quarter, very much to the annoyance of several people, amongst whom must  be included the young painter.</p>
<p>Maurice  de Crespigny, who for some years past had not been known to take an interest in  anything, exhibited a very great interest in Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s young wife.</p>
<p>The  old man had never forgotten the day upon which he had been suddenly carried back  to the past, by the apparition of a fair-haired girl who seemed to him the living  image of his lost friend. He had never forgotten this; and, when, a few days after  Eleanor&rsquo;s arrival at Tolldale, he happened to encounter her in one of his airings,  he had insisted on stopping to talk to her, much to the aggravation of his two maiden  warders.</p>
<p>Eleanor  caught eagerly at any chance of becoming familiar with her father&rsquo;s friend. It was  to him she looked for her promised vengeance. The law could give her no redress;  but Maurice de Crespigny held in his hand the disposition of that wealth for which  his young kinsman hoped, and thus possessed power to punish the cheat and traitor  who had robbed a helpless old man.</p>
<p>Even  if this motive had not existed, Eleanor&rsquo;s love for her dead father would have been  sufficient to inspire her with every tender feeling towards the owner of Woodlands.  Her manner, modified by this tenderness, acted almost like a spell upon Maurice  de Crespigny. He insisted upon coming, in the course of his daily airing, to that  part of the grounds where the two estates were only divided by a slender wire fence,  and where he might hope to meet Eleanor. By-and-by he extorted from her the promise  to meet him on every fine day at a particular hour, and it was in vain that the  maiden sisters endeavoured by every stratagem they could devise, to detain him in-doors  at this appointed time. They were fain to pray for perpetual wet weather, for storms  and fogs, whirlwinds, and other caprices of nature, which might keep the invalid  a prisoner to the house.</p>
<p>But  at last even rain and tempest ceased to be of any avail to these distressed and  expectant spinsters, for Maurice de Crespigny insisted upon inviting Mr. and Mrs.  Monckton to Woodlands. They were to come whenever they could, every day if they  could, the old man wrote, with a tremulous hand that was apt to go a little astray  over the paper; but which was yet strong enough and firm enough to inscribe a decent  signature at the foot of a Will.</p>
<p>The  two sisters never saw him write without thinking of this document. Was it made,  and made in their favour? Was it yet to make? or was it never to be made? and was  Launcelot Darrell to succeed to that coveted fortune, as heir-at-law?</p>
<p>Lavinia  and Sarah de Crespigny were agonised by the mere thought of this latter possibility.  It was not the money alone that they thought of, the lands and tenements alone that  they considered. There was the familiar house in which they had lived so long, the  household treasures which their own careful hands had dusted, as things too sacred  to be approached by meaner fingers.</p>
<p>There  were the old silver salvers, the antique tea and coffee services, the great dragon-china  jars on the staircase, the inlaid card-tables in the green parlour,&mdash;would the ruthless  heir-at-law come into possession, and seize even upon those particular household  gods which were most sacred to the maiden sisters?</p>
<p>They  knew that they had no claim to any great mercy from Launcelot Darrell. Had they  not urged his Indian voyage, and for ever offended him by so doing? It would have  been better perhaps to have been friendly towards him, and to have suffered him  to remain in England,  and to be as much at Woodlands as he pleased, thereby affording him ample opportunity  for giving offence to his great-uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  can count upon an old man&rsquo;s caprices,&rdquo; thought the maiden sisters, &ldquo;perhaps because  our uncle has seen very little of Launcelot, he may be all the more kindly disposed  towards him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the  other hand there was now the more imminent danger of this sudden fancy with which  Eleanor Monckton had inspired the invalid; and the sisters grew paler and more lugubrious  every day as they watched the progress of this eccentric friendship.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton placed no obstacle in the way of his wife&rsquo;s visits to Woodlands. He knew  how sternly the doors of Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s house were guarded against his widowed  niece and her son; and he knew that there at least Eleanor was not likely to meet  Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton was therefore free to visit her dead father&rsquo;s friend when she pleased;  and she was not slow to avail herself of this privilege. It was of vital importance  to her to be on familiar terms with Maurice de Crespigny, to be able to enter his  house when and how she would. She saw enough in the old man&rsquo;s face, in the fearful  uncertainty of his health&mdash;which one day suffered him to be bright and cheerful,  and on the next laid him prostrate and helpless upon a sick bed&mdash;to convince her  that his state was terribly precarious. He might linger for years. He might die  suddenly. He might die leaving his fortune to fall into the hands of Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>The  sisters watched, with ever-increasing alarm, the progress that Mrs. Monckton was  making in their uncle&rsquo;s favour. The old man seemed to brighten under the influence  of Eleanor&rsquo;s society. He had no glimmering idea of the truth; he fully believed  that the likeness which the lawyer&rsquo;s young wife bore to George Vane was one of those  accidental resemblances so common to the experience of every one. He believed this;  and yet in spite of this he felt as if Eleanor&rsquo;s presence brought back something  of his lost youth. Even his memory was revivified by the companionship of his dead  friend&rsquo;s daughter; and he would sit for hours together, talking, as his nieces had  not heard him talk in many monotonous years; telling familiar stories of that past  in which George Vane had figured so prominently.</p>
<p>To Eleanor  these old memories were never wearisome; and Maurice de Crespigny felt the delight  of talking to a listener who was really interested. He was accustomed to the polite  attention of his nieces, whose suppressed yawns sometimes broke in unpleasantly  at the very climax of a story, and whose wooden-faced stolidity had at best something  unpleasantly suggestive of being listened to and stared at by two Dutch clocks.  But he was not accustomed to see a beautiful and earnest face turned towards him  as he spoke; a pair of bright grey eyes lighting up with new radiance at every crisis  in the narrative; and lovely lips half parted through intensity of interest.</p>
<p>These  things the old man was not accustomed to, and he became entirely Eleanor&rsquo;s slave  and adorer. Indeed, the elderly damsels congratulated themselves upon Miss Vincent&rsquo;s  marriage with Gilbert Monckton; otherwise, Maurice de Crespigny being besotted and  infatuated, and the young woman mercenary, there might have been a new mistress  brought home to Woodlands instead of to Tolldale Priory.</p>
<p>Happily  for Eleanor, the anxious minds of the maiden sisters were set in some degree at  rest by a few words which Maurice de Crespigny let drop in a conversation with Mrs.  Monckton. Amongst the treasures possessed by the old man&mdash;the relics of a past life,  whose chief value lay in association&mdash;there was one object that was peculiarly precious  to Eleanor. This was a miniature portrait of George Vane, in the cap and gown which  he had worn sixty years before, at Magdalen  College, Oxford.</p>
<p>This  picture was very dear to Eleanor Monckton. It was no very wonderful work of art,  perhaps, but a laborious and patient performance, whose production had cost more  time and money than the photographic representations of half the members of the  Lower House would cost to day. It showed Eleanor a fair-haired stripling with bright  hopeful blue eyes. It was the shadow of her dead father&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p>Her  eyes filled with tears as she looked at the little ivory portrait in its oval case  of slippery red morocco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crocodile!&rdquo;  thought one of the maiden sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sycophant!&rdquo;  muttered the other.</p>
<p>But  this very miniature gave rise to that speech which had so much effect in calming  the terrors of the two ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  my dear,&rdquo; Maurice de Crespigny said; &ldquo;that portrait was painted sixty years ago.  George Vane would have been close upon eighty if he had lived. Yes, close upon eighty,  my love. You don&rsquo;t see your own likeness to that picture, perhaps; people seldom  do see resemblances of that kind. But the lad&rsquo;s face is like yours, my dear, and  you bring back the memory of my youth, just as the scent of some old-fashioned flower,  that our advanced horticulture has banished to a cottager&rsquo;s garden, brings back  the grass-plot upon which I played at my mother&rsquo;s knees. Do you know what I mean  to do, Mrs. Monckton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  lifted her eyebrows with an arch smile, as who should say, &ldquo;Your caprices are quite  beyond my power of divination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean  to leave that miniature to you in my Will, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  maiden sisters started simultaneously, agitated by the same emotion, and their eyes  met.</p>
<p>The  old man had made a Will, or meant to make a Will, then. That admission, at least,  was something. They had suffered so much from the apprehension that their uncle  would die without a Will, and that Launcelot Darrell would inherit the estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  my dear,&rdquo; Maurice de Crespigny repeated, &ldquo;I shall leave that miniature to you when  I die. It&rsquo;s not worth anything intrinsically; but I don&rsquo;t want you to be reminded  of me, when I&rsquo;m dead and gone, except through your own tender feelings. You&rsquo;ve been  interested in my stories of George Vane&mdash;who, with all his faults, and I&rsquo;m not slow  to acknowledge them, was a brighter and a better man than me&mdash;and it may please you  sometimes to look at that picture. You&rsquo;ve brought a ray of sunlight across a very  dismal pathway, my love,&rdquo; added the invalid, quite indifferent to the fact that  this remark was by no means complimentary to his devoted nurses and guardians, &ldquo;and  I am very grateful to you. If you were poor, I should leave you money. But you are  the wife of a rich man; and, beyond that, my fortune is already disposed of. I am  not free to leave it as I might wish; I have a duty to perform, my dear; a duty  which I consider sacred and imperative; and I shall fulfil that duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  old man had never before spoken so freely of his intentions with regard to his money.  The sisters sat staring blankly at each other, with quickened breaths and pale faces.</p>
<p>What  could this speech mean? Why, clearly that the money must be left to them. What other  duty could Maurice de Crespigny owe to any one? Had they not kept guard over him  for years, shutting him in, and separating him from every living creature? What  right had he to be grateful to any one but them, inasmuch as they had taken good  care that no one else should ever do him a service?</p>
<p>But  to the ears of Eleanor Monckton, the old man&rsquo;s speech had another signification;  the blood mounted to her face, and her heart beat violently. &ldquo;He is thinking of  Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;he will leave his fortune to Launcelot Darrell.  He will die before he learns the secret of my father&rsquo;s wrongs. His Will is already  made, no doubt, and he will die before I can dare to say to him, &lsquo;Your niece&rsquo;s son  is a trickster and a villain!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was the only occasion upon which Maurice de Crespigny ever spoke of his intentions  with regard to the fortune that he must leave behind him. He said, plainly enough,  that Eleanor was to have none of his money; and the sisters, who had until now kept  a jealous watch upon the old man and his favourite, were henceforward content to  let Mrs. Monckton come and go as she pleased. But for all this Eleanor was no nearer  the accomplishment of her great purpose.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell came to Tolldale, and in a certain easy and somewhat indifferent manner  paid his homage to his affianced wife. Laura was happy by fits and starts; and by  fits and starts utterly miserable, when the horrible pangs of jealousy&mdash;jealousy  of Eleanor, and jealous doubts of her lover&rsquo;s truth&mdash;tortured her breast. Gilbert  Monckton sat day after day in the library or the drawing-room, or Eleanor&rsquo;s morning-room,  as the case might be, keeping watch over his wife and the lovers.</p>
<p>But  though the days and weeks went by with an unnatural rapidity, as it seemed to Mrs.  Monckton, with a wearisome slowness in the opinion of her husband&mdash;the progress of  time brought George Vane&rsquo;s daughter no further onward, by so much as one step, upon  the pathway which she had chosen for herself.</p>
<p>Christmas  came; and the girl whose youth had been spent in the shabby lodgings in which her  father had hidden the poverty of his decline, the patient young housekeeper who  had been used to eke out ounces of tea, and to entreat for brief respite and grace  from aggrieved chandlers, was called upon to play my Lady Bountiful at Tolldale  Priory, and to dole out beef and bread, blankets and brandy, coals and flannels,  to a host of hungry and shivering claimants.</p>
<p>Christmas  passed, and the new year struggled into life under every disadvantage of bad weather;  while the spring, the dreaded early spring, which was to witness Laura&rsquo;s marriage,  approached with a stealthy footfall, creeping day by day nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>Eleanor,  in very despair, appealed to Richard Thornton.</p>
<p>She  appealed to him from the force of habit, perhaps: as a fretful child complains to  its mother, rather than from any hope that he could aid her in her great scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Richard,&rdquo; she wrote, despairingly, &ldquo;help me, help me, help me! I thought all would  be so easy if I could once come to this place. But I am here, and I see Launcelot  Darrell every day, and yet I am no nearer the end. What am I to do? January is nearly  over; and in March, Laura Mason is to marry that man. Mr. de Crespigny is very ill,  and may die at any moment, leaving his money to his niece&rsquo;s son. Is this man, who  caused my father&rsquo;s death, to have all the brightest and best things this world can  give? Is he to have a noble fortune and an amiable wife? and am I to stand by and  permit him to be happy; remembering what happened upon that dreadful night in Paris&mdash;remembering  that my father lies in his unconsecrated grave, and that his blood is upon this  man&rsquo;s head? Help me, Richard. Come to me; help me to find proof positive of Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s guilt. You can help me, if you please. Your brain is clearer, your perception  quicker, than mine. I am carried away by my own passion&mdash;blinded by my indignation.  You were right when you said I should never succeed in this work. I look to you  to avenge my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
  A Powerful Ally</strong></h2>
<p>Richard Thornton was not slow to respond to Eleanor&rsquo;s summons. The same  post which carried Mrs. Monckton&rsquo;s letter to the young man, conveyed another letter,  addressed to the Signora, urging her to abandon her pupils, for a time at least,  and to come at once to Tolldale.</p>
<p>Eleanor  had not forgotten the faithful friends who had succoured her in the day of her desolation,  but the Signora&rsquo;s habits of independence were not to be conquered, and Mrs. Monckton  found there was very little that Eliza Picirillo would consent to accept from her.</p>
<p>She  had insisted upon removing the music-mistress from the eccentric regions of the  Pilasters to a comfortable first-floor in Dudley Street. She had furnished this new  shelter with easy chairs, and Brussels carpets, an Erard&rsquo;s piano, and proof impressions  of the Signora&rsquo;s favourite pictures; and in doing this she had very nearly exhausted  her first year&rsquo;s income, much to the satisfaction of Gilbert Monckton, who implored  her to call upon him freely for any money she might want for her friends.</p>
<p>It pleased  him to see her do these things. It was a delight to him to see her thus tenderly  grateful to the friends of her adversity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mercenary  woman would have cast off these humble associations,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;this girl must  be the noble creature I believed her to be, when I flung down my happiness for the  second time at a woman&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  although Eleanor would have gladly lavished every shilling she possessed upon Eliza  Picirillo and her nephew, she could not persuade either the music-mistress or the  scene-painter to work less hard than it had been their wont to do for many wearisome  years. The Signora still went from house to house in attendance upon her out-of-door  pupils, and still received young ladies bent on wearing the laurel crown of the  lyric drama. Richard still painted snow-clad mountain-tops, and impossible Alpine  passes, impracticably prosperous villages, and wide-spreading farm-lands of yellow  corn, bounded by rustic white palings, and inhabited by husbandmen in linen gaiters  and chintz waistcoats. It was in vain, therefore, that Mrs. Monckton had hitherto  implored her friends to come to Tolldale, and it was only in consequence of a very  serious misunderstanding with Messrs. Spavin and Cromshaw, which for a time threw  the scene-painter out of employment, that Richard Thornton was able to respond to  Eleanor&rsquo;s earnest appeal.</p>
<p>A January  that had been bleaker and colder than even January is expected to be, was drawing  to a close, when Signora Picirillo and her nephew arrived at the Priory. The woods  round Tolldale were shrouded with snow, the broad lawns before Woodlands were as  white as Richard&rsquo;s Alpine passes, and Maurice de Crespigny had been for many weeks  a prisoner to the house. Laura&rsquo;s wedding-day was appointed for the fifteenth of  March, and that young lady was, when unoccupied by her lover&rsquo;s society, entirely  absorbed in the millinery and mantua-making necessary for the preparation of her  bridal outfit.</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton had considerably modified the eccentric fashion of his beard, and had bought  a new suit of clothes in honour of his fair young hostess. The scene-painter had  not seen Eleanor since the morning on which he had fled away from the Pilasters  to hide his sorrows amongst the swamps of Battersea. The meeting, therefore, was  a painful one to him; all the more painful, perhaps, because Mrs. Monckton received  him with the frankly affectionate welcome which she would have bestowed upon a brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must help me, Dick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for the sake of others, if not for my sake; you  cannot now refuse to fathom this mystery. If Launcelot Darrell is the man I believe  him to be, he is no fit husband for an affectionate and trusting girl. He has no  right to inherit Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune! The marriage between Laura and  this man is to take place upon the fifteenth of March. Maurice de Crespigny may  die to-morrow. We have very little time before us, Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mr.  Thornton was fain to obey the imperious young lady, who had been in the habit of  ordering him about ever since those old days in which he had kept rabbits and silkworms  for her gratification. He set himself to his task very faithfully, and did his best  to become acquainted with Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>The  well-born young artist, who meant to do something very great in the Academy, at  his earliest convenience, treated the scene-painter with a supercilious good-nature  that was by no means agreeable to Mr. Thornton.</p>
<p>Dick  had resolved <em>not</em> to be prejudiced against Eleanor&rsquo;s fancied enemy, lest that  young lady&rsquo;s vehement impulses should have led her into rather an awkward mistake;  but there was something in the insolent assurance of Launcelot Darrell that aroused  Richard&rsquo;s indignation, and it was not without an effort that he contrived to be  commonly civil to poor Laura&rsquo;s affianced husband.</p>
<p>Launcelot  dined at Tolldale upon the evening of the arrival of Eleanor&rsquo;s guests, and it was  at the dinner-table that Richard first had an opportunity of observing the man he  had been entreated to watch. Mr. Monckton, sitting at the bottom of the table, and  looking at his wife athwart a glittering array of glass and silver, became aware  of a change in Eleanor&rsquo;s manner. A change that mystified and bewildered him, but  which was not altogether unpleasant to him.</p>
<p>The  lawyer&rsquo;s jealousy had been chiefly aroused by the perpetual uneasiness of Eleanor&rsquo;s  manner when Launcelot Darrell was present; by the furtive, yet unguarded watch which  she kept upon the young man&rsquo;s movements. To-night, for the first time, her manner  had changed. It was no longer Launcelot Darrell, but Richard Thornton whom she watched.</p>
<p>Following  every varying expression of her face, Gilbert Monckton saw that she looked at the  scene-painter with an earnest, questioning, appealing glance, that seemed to demand  something of him, or urge him on to the performance of something that she wanted  done. Looking from his wife to Richard, the lawyer saw that Launcelot Darrell was  still watched, but this time the eyes that observed him were those of the Signora&rsquo;s  nephew.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton felt very much like a spectator, who looks on at a drama which is being  acted in a language that is unknown to him. The <em>dramatis person&aelig;</em> come in,  they are earnest or vehement, joyous or sorrowful, as the case may be, but not having  any clue to the plot, the wretched looker-on can scarcely feel intense delight in  the performance.</p>
<p>Eleanor  contrived to question her ally in the course of the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Richard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is Launcelot Darrell the man who cheated my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, Mrs. Monckton, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you think&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  he is by no means the most delightful or the best of men. He snubs me because I  paint scenery for the Phoenix;  and he accepts that silly little girl&rsquo;s homage with the air of a sultan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t like him, Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Thornton drew a long breath, as if by some powerful effort of his will he repressed  a vehement and unseemly expression of feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  he&rsquo;s&mdash;you know what a great tragedian used to call people when they rang down the  act-drop three minutes before Lear had finished using bad language to his eldest  daughter, or came up in the witches&rsquo; cauldron with their backs to the audience&mdash;and  nervous people have been known to do that, Eleanor:&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t pleasant to stand on  a rickety ladder and talk to a quick-tempered tragedian out of a canvas saucepan,  with the smell of burning rosin in your nostrils, and another nervous apparition  wanting to get you off the ladder before you&rsquo;ve finished your speech. I think Launcelot  Darrell is&mdash;a beast, Mrs. Monckton; and I have no doubt he would  cheat at cards, if he had the chance of doing it with perfect safety and convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  think that?&rdquo; cried Eleanor, seizing upon this latter part of Richard&rsquo;s speech; &ldquo;you  think that he would cheat a helpless old man. Prove that, Richard, prove it, and  I will be as merciless to Launcelot Darrell as he was to my father&mdash;his uncle&rsquo;s friend,  too; he knew that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor  Monckton,&rdquo; Richard said, earnestly, &ldquo;I have never been serious before upon this  matter; I have hoped that you would outlive your girlish resolution; I hoped above  all that when you married&mdash;&rdquo; his voice trembled a little here, but he went bravely  on&mdash;&ldquo;new duties would make you forget that old promise; and I did my best, Heaven  knows, to wean you from the infatuation. But now that I have seen this man, Launcelot  Darrell, it seems to me as if there may have been something of inspiration in your  sudden recognition of him. I have already seen enough of him to know at least that  he is no fit husband for that poor little romantic girl with the primrose-coloured  ringlets; and I will do my best to find out where he was, and what he was doing,  during those years in which he is supposed to have been in India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will do this, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs. Monckton:&rdquo; the young man addressed his old companion by this name, using the  unfamiliar appellation as a species of rod by which he kept in order and subdued  certain rebellious emotions that would arise as he remembered how utterly the beautiful  girl, whose presence had made sunshine in the shabbiest, if not the shadiest of  places, was now lost to him. &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Monckton, I will try and fathom the mystery.  This Launcelot Darrell must be very clever if he can have contrived to do away with  every vestige of the years in which he was or was not in India. However softly Time may tread,  he leaves his footmarks behind him, and it will be strange if we can&rsquo;t find some  tell-tale impression whereby Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s secret may be discovered. By-the-bye,  Mrs. Monckton, you have had a good deal of time for observation. What have you done  towards investigating the young man&rsquo;s antecedents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  blushed, and hesitated a little before she answered this very direct question</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  watched him very closely,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve listened to every word he has ever  said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  be sure. In the expectation, no doubt, that he would betray himself by frowns and  scowls, and other facial contortions, after the manner of a stage villain; or that  he would say, &lsquo;At such a time I was in Paris;&rsquo; or, &lsquo;At such a time I cheated at  cards.&rsquo; You go cleverly to work, Mrs. Monckton, for an amateur detective!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  ought I to have done, then?&rdquo; Eleanor asked despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  should have endeavoured to trace up the history of the past by those evidences which  the progress of life can scarcely fail to leave behind it. Watch the man&rsquo;s habits  and associations, rather than the man himself. Have you had access to the rooms  in which he lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  I have been with Laura to Hazlewood often since I came here. I have been in Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  have you seen nothing there? no book, no letter, no scrap of evidence that might  make one link in the story of this man&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing  particular. He has some French novels on a shelf in one corner of his sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  but the possession of a few French novels scarcely proves that he was in Paris in the year &rsquo;53. Did  you look at the titles of the books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.  What could I have gained by seeing them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something,  perhaps. The French are a volatile people. The fashion of one year is not the fashion  of another. If you had found some work that made a <em>furore</em> in that particular  year, you might have argued that Launcelot Darrell was a <em>fl&acirc;neur</em> in the Galerie  d&rsquo;Orleans or on the Boulevard where the book was newly exhibited in the shop-windows.  If the novels were new ones, and not Michel Levey&rsquo;s eternal reprints of Sand and  Souli&eacute;, Balzac and Bernard, you might have learnt something from them. The science  of detection, Mrs. Monckton, lies in the observation of insignificant things. It  is a species of mental geology. A geologist looks into a gravel pit, and tells you  the history of the creation; a clever detective looks over a man&rsquo;s carpet-bag, and  convicts that man of a murder or a forgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  I have been very stupid,&rdquo; Eleanor murmured almost piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven  forbid that you should ever be very clever in such a line as this. There must be  detective officers; they are the polished blood-hounds of our civilised age, and  very noble and estimable animals when they do their duty conscientiously; but fair-haired  young ladies should be kept out of this <em>gal&egrave;re</em>. Think no more of this business,  then, Eleanor. If Launcelot Darrell was the man who played &eacute;cart&eacute; with your father  on the 11th of August, &rsquo;53, I&rsquo;ll find a proof of his guilt. Trust me to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  trust you, Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton held out her hand with a certain queenliness of gesture, as if she would  thereby have ratified a bond between herself and her old friend; and as the flower  of bygone chivalry were wont to vow the accomplishment of great deeds on the jewelled  hilt of a cross-handled sword, so Richard Thornton, bending his honest head, swore  allegiance upon the hand of Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s young wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One  word more, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; said the scene-painter, &ldquo;and then we had better leave  off talking, or people will begin to wonder why we are so confidential and mysterious.  This Mr. Darrell is an artist, I understand. Does he paint much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, a great deal; that is to say, he begins a great many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely;  he does a good many rough sketches, scraps of pencil and crayon, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  he fills portfolios with such scraps, and litters his studio with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  I must have a look at his studio, Mrs. Monckton. An artist&mdash;yes, even the poorest  artist, the furthest away from the sublimity of genius, is sure to be fond of his  art. He makes a confidant of it; he betrays a hundred secrets, that he keeps locked  from every living creature, in the freedom of his studio. His pencil is the outer  expression of his mind, and whatever falsehoods he may impose upon his fellow-men,  his sketch-book will tell the truth. It will betray him when he is false, and reveal  him when he is true. I must have a look at Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s studio, Mrs. Monckton.  Let me see the man&rsquo;s pictures, and I may be able to tell you more about the man  himself.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
  The Testimony Of The Sketch-Book</strong></h2>
<p>It is only natural that one painter should take an interest in the work of  another. Mr. Darrell testified no surprise, therefore, when Richard Thornton appeared  at Hazlewood the morning after his arrival at Tolldale, under convoy of Mrs. Monckton  and Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  come to say how sorry I was at your not coming to dinner last night, dear Mrs. Darrell,&rdquo;  Laura said to the lady who was so soon to be her mother-in-law; &ldquo;and I want to ask  you whether I ought to have the sprigged muslin morning dresses trimmed with pink  or blue, or whether I ought to have three of them pink and three blue, for Launcelot  might get tired of seeing me in the same colours, you know, and I might have two  of them trimmed with peach, if it came to that; and Eleanor has come with me; and  Mr. Thornton&mdash;Mr. Thornton, Mrs. Darrell; Mrs. Darrell, Mr. Thornton&mdash;has come too,  because he is an artist, and wants to see Launcelot&rsquo;s pictures&mdash;especially the beautiful  picture that&rsquo;s going into the Academy, and that the committee is sure to hang on  the line; and I&rsquo;m sure Launcelot will let Mr. Thornton see his studio,&mdash;won&rsquo;t you,  dear Launcelot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason pursed up her rosy lips, and put her head on one side like an insinuating  canary, as she addressed her affianced husband. She looked very pretty in her winter  costume, with a good deal of rich brown fur about her, and a dash of scarlet here  and there. She looked like a fashionably-dressed Red Ridinghood, simple enough to  be deluded by the weakest-minded of wolves. She was so pretty that her lover glanced  down at her with a gratified smile, deriving considerable pleasure from the idea  that she belonged to him, and that she was, on the whole, something to be rather  proud of; something that added to the young sultan&rsquo;s dignity, and bore testimony  to his supreme merits.</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked at the lovers with a contemptuous curve lifting her firm upper lip. She despised  Launcelot Darrell so utterly, that she was almost cruel enough to despise Laura  for loving him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she thought, &ldquo;Mr. Monckton is right. Shallow, selfish and frivolous! He is all these,  and he is false as well. Heaven help you, Laura, if I cannot save you from a marriage  with this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell was very well pleased to do the honours of his studio to Richard Thornton.  It would be quite a new sort of thing to this scene-painting fellow, the embryo  Academician thought: the poor devil would pick up fresh ideas, and get a glimpse  at the higher regions of art for the first time in his life perhaps.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell led the way to that pleasant, prettily-furnished room which he called his  studio. The &ldquo;Rosalind and Celia&rdquo; still occupied the post of honour on the easel.  Mr. Darrell worked very hard, but in that spasmodic fashion which is antagonistic  to anything like progress. The enthusiasm which upon one occasion kept him at his  picture long after the fading light had given him notice to leave it, entirely deserted  him upon another, and was perhaps followed by a fit of disgust with himself and  with his art, which kept him idle for weeks together.</p>
<p>He made  a merit of this fitfulness, depreciating a power of steady and persistent labour  as the faculty of a tradesman, rather than an artist. He took credit to himself  for the long pauses of idleness in which he waited for what he called inspiration;  and imposed upon his mother by his grand talk about earnestness, conscientiousness,  reverence for the sublimity of art, and a great many more fine phrases by which  he contrived to excuse the simple fact of his laziness. So Eleanor Vane, as sorrowful <em>Rosalind</em>, still smiled sadly upon a simpering <em>Celia:</em>&mdash;it had been quite  impossible to prevent Miss Mason&rsquo;s assuming the conventional simper of the weak-minded  sitter, who can&rsquo;t forget that his portrait is being taken, and that he is in a manner  in the very act of handing down his smile to posterity, or to the furniture brokers&mdash;out  of an unfinished background, and clad in robes of unfinished satin and velvet. Mr.  Thornton wondered as he looked at the young man&rsquo;s work, and remembered how many  miles of canvas it had been his own fate to cover since first he had handled his  brushes, and splashed in sky borders and cloud pieces for the chief scene-painter  at the Ph&oelig;nix.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell, with his mahlstick in his hand, smiled with sublime patronage upon Eleanor&rsquo;s  humble friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  sort of thing is rather different to what you&rsquo;ve been used to, I suppose?&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;rather another kind of work than your pantomime scenes, your grots of everlasting  bliss, and caves of constant content, where the water-falls are spangles sewn upon  white tape, and the cloudless skies are blue gauze and silver foil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  we&rsquo;re not always painting transformations, you know,&rdquo; Mr. Thornton answered, in  nowise offended by the artist&rsquo;s graceful insolence; &ldquo;scene-painting isn&rsquo;t <em>all</em> done with Dutch metal and the glue-pot: we&rsquo;re obliged to know a little about perspective,  and to have a slight knowledge of colour. Some of my brotherhood have turned out  tolerable landscape-painters, Mr. Darrell. By-the-bye, you don&rsquo;t do anything in  the way of landscape, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Launcelot Darrell answered, indifferently, &ldquo;I used to try my hand at landscape;  but human interest, human interest, Mr. Thornton, is the strong point of a picture.  To my mind a picture should be a story, a drama, a tragedy, a poem&mdash;something that  explains itself without any help from a catalogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.  An epic upon a Bishop&rsquo;s half-length,&rdquo; Richard Thornton answered, rather absently.  He saw Eleanor&rsquo;s watchful eyes fixed upon him, and knew that with every moment she  was losing faith in him. Looking round the room he saw, too, that there were a couple  of bloated portfolios leaning against the wall, and running over with sheets of  dirty Bristol board and crumpled drawing paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Launcelot Darrell repeated, &ldquo;I have tried my hand at landscape. There are a few  in one of those portfolios&mdash;the upper one, I think&mdash;not the purple one; I keep private  memoranda and scraps in that. The green portfolio, Mr. Thornton; you may find some  things there that will interest you&mdash;that might be useful to you, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  artist threw down his mahlstick, and strolled across the room to talk to Laura Mason  and his mother, who were sitting near the fire. In doing this he left Eleanor and  Richard side by side, near the easel and the corner in which the portfolios leaned  against the wall.</p>
<p>There  was a large old-fashioned window in this corner of the room, the casement against  which Eleanor had stood when Launcelot Darrell asked her to be his wife. The window  was in a deep recess, shaded by thick crimson curtains, and in the recess there  was a table. Any one sitting at this table was almost concealed from the other inmates  of the room.</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton lifted both the portfolios, and placed them on this table. Eleanor stood  beside him, breathless and expectant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  purple portfolio contains private memoranda,&rdquo; whispered the young man; &ldquo;it is in  that portfolio we must look, Mrs. Monckton. There is no such thing as honour in  the road we have chosen for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  scene-painter untied the strings of the loaded scrap-book, and flung it open. A  chaotic mass of drawings lay before him. Crayon sketches; pencil scraps; unfinished  and finished water-coloured drawings; rough caricatures in pen-and-ink, and in water-colours;  faint indications of half-obliterated subjects; heads, profiles, chins, and noses;  lithographed costumes, prints, etchings, illustrations torn out of books and newspapers;  all flung together in bewildering confusion.</p>
<p>Mr.  Thornton, seated at the table with his head bent over the papers before him, and  with Eleanor standing at his shoulder, began steadily and deliberately to examine  the contents of this purple portfolio.</p>
<p>He carefully  scrutinised each drawing, however slight, however roughly done, however unpretentious.  He looked also at the back of each drawing, sometimes finding a blank, sometimes  finding a faint pencil indication of a rubbed-out sketch, or a rough outline in  pen-and-ink.</p>
<p>For  a long time he found nothing in which the utmost ingenuity could discover any relation  to that period of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s existence which Eleanor believed to have been  spent in Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belisarius.  Girl with basket of strawberries. Marie Antoinette. Headsman. Flower-girl. Oliver  Cromwell refusing the crown. Oliver Cromwell denouncing Sir Harry Vane. Oliver Cromwell  and his daughters. Fairfax,&rdquo;&mdash;muttered  Richard, as he looked over the sketches. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, Eleanor, that a man&rsquo;s  sketch-book contains the record of his life? These Cromwell drawings are all dated  in the same year. Nearly ten years ago; that is to say, when Mr. Darrell had very  little knowledge of anatomy and a tremendous passion for republicanism. Further  on we come to a pastoral strata, you see. The Water-mill: Rosa.  There is a perpetual recurrence of Rosa and the Water-mill: Rosa in a bridal dress;  the mill by moonlight; Rosa in simple russet cloak; the mill in a thunder-storm;  Rosa sad; the mill at sunset: and the series bears date two years later, when the  artist was desperately in love with a rustic beauty in this neighbourhood. Now we  lose sight of Rosa, and come upon a Roman period:  the artist goes in for the grand and classic. The Roman period lasts a very short  time. Now we are in London;  yes, we are up to our eyes in student life in the metropolis. Here are sketches  of artist existence in Clipstone Street  and the purlieus of Fitzroy Square.  Here is the Haymarket by night. An opera-box. Lady Clara Vere de Vere. Lady Clara  at the flower show&mdash;in Hyde Park&mdash;at a concert&mdash;aha!  the artist is in love again, and this time the beauty is high-born and unapproachable.  Here are pen-and-ink hints at contemplated suicide; a young man lying on a pallet  bed, an empty bottle on the floor labelled Prussic Acid; another young man leaning  over the parapet of Waterloo Bridge on a moonlit night, with St. Paul&rsquo;s in the background. Yes, there have  been wasted love and despair, and a wild yearning for death, and that generally  morbid and unpleasant state of mind which is the common result of idleness and strong  liquors. Stay!&rdquo; cried Richard Thornton suddenly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all wrong here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Eleanor. She had watched the young man&rsquo;s examination of the  drawings with eager interest, with ever-increasing impatience, in her desire to  come to something that should be evidence against Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; she said, and then she added impatiently: &lsquo;How slow you are, Dick!  What do I want to know of this man except the one proof that will identify him with  that man upon the Boulevard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid we&rsquo;ve been making a mistake all this time,&rdquo; Richard said, in rather a despondent  tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid these sketches must have been done by some companion of Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s.  I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re none of them his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  his? But why&mdash;why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  the first lot, the Cromwells and the Rosas, are all signed with a flourishing autograph&mdash;&lsquo;Launcelot  Darrell, pinxt.,&rsquo; in full, as if the young man were rather proud of his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; but what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  London life sketches, the Lady Claras and the suicides, which are much better than  the first lot, though I should have thought they had been by the same man, are all  signed with a monogram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A monogram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  of two initials. I&rsquo;ve been trying to make them out for ever so long, and I&rsquo;ve only  just succeeded. The two letters are R. L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton felt Eleanor&rsquo;s hand, which had been resting lightly upon the back of his  chair, tighten suddenly upon the rosewood scrollwork, he heard her breath grow quicker,  and when he turned his head he saw that she was deadly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is coming home to him, Richard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The man who cheated my father called  himself &lsquo;Robert Lan&mdash;&rsquo; Part of the name was torn away in my father&rsquo;s letter, but  the initials of that false name are R. L. Go on, Dick; go on quickly, for pity&rsquo;s  sake; we shall find something more presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton had spoken in a whisper, but at this moment the scene-painter laid his  hand upon her wrist and reminded her by a gesture of the need of caution. But Mr.  Darrell, and the two ladies at the other end of the roomy studio, were in no manner  observant of anything that might be going on in the curtained recess of the window.  Laura was talking, and her lover was laughing at her, half pleased, half amused,  by her childish frivolity.</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton turned over a heap of sketches without speaking.</p>
<p>But  presently he came upon a water-colour drawing of a long lamplit street, crowded  with figures in grotesque costumes, and with masks upon their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  have crossed the Channel, Eleanor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here is Paris in Carnival time, and here is the assumed  name, too, in full,&mdash;&lsquo;Robert Lance, March 2nd, &rsquo;53.&rsquo; Be quiet, Eleanor, be calm,  for Heaven&rsquo;s sake. The man is guilty; I believe that now, as fully as you do; but  we have to bring his guilt home to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep  that sketch, Richard,&rdquo; whispered the girl, &ldquo;keep it. It is the proof of his false  name. It is the proof that he was in Paris when he  was believed to be in India.  It is the proof that he was in Paris  a few months before my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  scene-painter folded the tumbled sheet of drawing-paper and thrust it into the breast  pocket of his loose coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go  on, Richard; go on,&rdquo; said Eleanor; &ldquo;there may be something more than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man obeyed his eager companion; one by one he looked at the pen-and-ink sketches,  the crayon drawings, the unfinished scraps in Indian ink or water colour.</p>
<p>They  all bore evidence of a life in Paris and its neighbourhood. Now a <em>d&eacute;bardeur</em> hanging on the arm of a student; now a grisette drinking <em>limonade gaseuse</em> with an artisan beyond the barrier; a funeral train entering the gates of P&egrave;re la  Chaise; a showman on the Boulevard; a group of Zouaves; a bit of landscape in the  forest of Saint Germain, with equestrian figures beneath an arch of foliage; a scene  in the Champs Elys&eacute;es.</p>
<p>And  at last, a rough pencil sketch of a group in a small chamber at a <em>caf&eacute;;</em> an  old man seated at a lamplit table playing <em>&eacute;cart&eacute;</em> with a man whose face was  hidden; an aristocratic-looking, shabby, genteel old man, whose nervous fingers  seemed to clutch restlessly at a little pile of napoleons on the table before him.</p>
<p>There  was a third figure: the figure of a smartly dressed Frenchman standing behind the  old man&rsquo;s chair; and in this watcher of the game Eleanor recognised the man who  had persuaded her father to leave her on the Boulevard, the companion of the sulky  Englishman.</p>
<p>The  sketch was dated August 12, 1853; the very day on which Richard Thornton had recognised  the dead man in the ghastly chamber of the Morgue. On the back of the drawing were  written these words, &ldquo;Sketch for finished picture to be called &lsquo;The last of the  Napoleons&rsquo;&mdash;Robert Lance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  likeness of the principal figure to George Vane was unmistakable. The man who had  been heartless enough to cheat his kinsman&rsquo;s friend, had made this record of the  scene of his cruelty, but had not been so callous as to carry out his design after  the suicide of his victim.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
  Maurice De Crespigny&rsquo;s Will</strong></h2>
<p>Richard Thornton folded the pencil sketch and put it in his pocket with  the water-coloured drawing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told  you that Launcelot Darrell would make a confidant of his pencil,&rdquo; he said in a low  voice. &ldquo;We may as well tie up the portfolio, Mrs. Monckton; there will be nothing  more in it that can help us. The memory of your father would scarcely be pleasant  to this young man after the 12th of August. When he made this sketch he had yet  to learn the consequences of what he had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  stood behind the scene-painter&rsquo;s chair, silent and motionless. Her face was pale,  and her mouth compressed and rigid with the effort by which she controlled her agitation.  But a flame of fire burned in her luminous grey eyes, and her delicate nostrils  quivered with a convulsive movement. Mr. Thornton carefully replaced the sketches  in the purple portfolio, tied the strings, and laid the book in its old place against  the wall. Then, unfastening the green portfolio, he went rapidly through the landscape  scraps which it contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  hand is weak here,&rdquo; Richard said; &ldquo;Mr. Launcelot Darrell has no sympathy with nature.  He might be a clever figure-painter if he had as much perseverance as he has talent.  His pictures are like himself; shallow, artificial, and meretricious; but they are  clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  scene-painter said this with a purpose. He knew that Eleanor stood behind him, erect  and statuesque, with her hand grasping the back of his chair, a pale Nemesis bent  on revenge and destruction. He wanted, if possible, to let her down to commonplace  feeling, by his commonplace talk, before Launcelot Darrell saw her face. But, looking  round at that pale young face, Richard saw how terrible was the struggle in the  girl&rsquo;s breast, and how likely she was at any moment to betray herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor,&rdquo;  he whispered, &ldquo;if you want to carry this business to the end, you must keep your  secret. Launcelot Darrell is coming this way. Remember that an artist is quick to  observe. There is the plot of a tragedy in your face at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton tried to smile; but the attempt was very feeble; the smile wan and sickly.  Launcelot Darrell came to the curtained recess, but he was not alone: Laura Mason  came with him, talking very fast, and asking innumerable questions, now turning  to her lover, now appealing to Eleanor or Richard Thornton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a time you&rsquo;ve been looking over the sketches,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and how do you like them,  and which do you like best? Do you like the sea-side bits, or the forest sketches?  There&rsquo;s a picture of Tolldale with the cupola and the dinner-bell, Eleanor; I like  the sketches in the other portfolio best; Launcelot lets <em>me</em> look at them,  though he won&rsquo;t allow any one else to see them. But I don&rsquo;t like Rosa. I&rsquo;m terribly jealous of Rosa&mdash;yes,  I am, Launcelot; and it&rsquo;s not a bit of use telling me you were never in love with  her, and you only admired her because she was a pretty rustic model. Nobody in the  world could believe that, could they, Mr. Thornton? Could they, Eleanor? When an  artist paints the same face again and again, and again and again, he must be in  love with the original; mustn&rsquo;t he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody  answered the young lady&rsquo;s eager questions. Launcelot Darrell smiled and twisted  his dark moustache between his slender, womanish fingers. Laura&rsquo;s unrestrained admiration  of him was very agreeable; and he was beginning to be in love with her, after his  own fashion, which was a very easy one.</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked at her husband&rsquo;s ward with a strange expression in her face&mdash;a stern unpitying  gaze that promised little good to the young heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is this foolish girl&rsquo;s fancy to me, that it should weigh against my father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;  she thought. &ldquo;What is it to me that she may have to suffer? Let me remember the  bitterness of his sufferings; let me remember that long night upon which I watched  for him,&mdash;that miserable night in which he despaired and died. Surely the remembrance  of this will shut every thought of pity from my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps  Eleanor Monckton had need to reason with herself thus. It might be difficult to  be true to her scheme of vengeance, when, in the path she had to tread, this girl&rsquo;s  heart must be trampled upon; this innocent, childish, confiding little creature  who had clung to her, and trusted in her, and loved her, from the hour of their  first meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should  I be pitiful, or merciful, or just to her, if I suffered her to marry a bad man?&rdquo;  Mrs. Monckton asked herself. &ldquo;No; for her sake as much as for the memory of my father,  it is my duty to denounce Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout  the drive back to Tolldale, Mrs. Monckton silently brooded upon the morning&rsquo;s work.  Richard Thornton had indeed proved a powerful ally. How often she had been in that  studio, and not once had the idea of looking amongst the artist&rsquo;s sketches for the  evidence of his life occurred to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told  you that you could help me, Richard,&rdquo; she said, when she found herself alone with  the scene-painter. &ldquo;You have given me the proof which I have waited for so long.  I will go to Woodlands to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  show those two sketches to Mr. de Crespigny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  will that proof be strong enough to convince a man whose powers of perception must  be weakened by age? What if Mr. de Crespigny should fail to understand the evidence  of those sketches? What if he should refuse to believe your accusation of his nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  show him my father&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  forget that your father&rsquo;s letter accuses Robert Lance, and not Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the sketches are signed &lsquo;Robert Lance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Darrell may deny his identity with the man who signed himself by that name.  You cannot ask Maurice de Crespigny to believe in his nephew&rsquo;s guilt on the testimony  of a pencil drawing which that nephew may boldly repudiate. No, Eleanor, the work  of to-day is only one step upon the road we have to tread. We must be patient, and  wait for more conclusive proof than that which we hold in these two sketches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  sighed wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  in the meantime the 15th of March may come, or Mr. de Crespigny may die,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Oh, let me go to him at once; let me tell him who I am, and show him my father&rsquo;s  letter; let me tell him the cruel story of his old friend&rsquo;s death! He knows nothing  but that which he learned from a brief notice in a newspaper. He cannot refuse to  believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have asked me to help you, Eleanor,&rdquo; he said, gravely; &ldquo;if I am to do so, you must  have some faith in my counsel. Wait until we have fuller power to prove our case,  before you reveal yourself to Mr. de Crespigny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton could not very well refuse to submit herself to the scene-painter&rsquo;s guidance.  He had already most decisively demonstrated the superiority of his deliberate policy,  as compared with the impulsive and unconsidered course of action recklessly followed  by a headstrong girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must  obey you, Dick,&rdquo; Eleanor said, &ldquo;because you are so good to me, and have done so  much to prove that you are a great deal wiser than I am. But if Mr. de Crespigny  should die while we are waiting for further proof, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  blame me for his death, I suppose, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; interrupted Richard, with a quiet  smile, &ldquo;after the manner of your sex?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  had no little difficulty in obeying her counsellor, for when Gilbert Monckton met  his wife at dinner, he told her that he had been at Woodlands that morning, and  that her friend Maurice de Crespigny was daily growing weaker, and was not expected  to live through the early spring months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  old man is fading slowly away,&rdquo; the lawyer said. &ldquo;His quiet and temperate habits  have enabled him to hold out much longer than the doctors expected. It is like the  gradual going out of a candle, they say. The flame sinks little by little in the  socket. You must go and see the poor old man, Eleanor, before he dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before  he dies!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Monckton, &ldquo;before he dies! Do you think he will die very  soon, then, or suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I think he may go off suddenly at last. The medical men say as much, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked at Richard Thornton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must  see him, and must see him before he dies,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is his mind unimpaired, Gilbert?  Is his intellect still as clear as it was a week ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;I have every reason to believe so; for while I was talking  to the two ladies in the breakfast-parlour, Henry Lawford, the Windsor attorney,  came in, and asked me to go up to Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s room. What do you think I was  wanted for, Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  wanted to act as witness to the old man&rsquo;s will, in conjunction with Lawford&rsquo;s clerk.  I need scarcely tell you I was not a little astonished to find that Maurice de Crespigny  had only now made up his mind as to the disposal of his money. I suppose he has  made half a dozen wills, and destroyed one after another according to his humour.  I only hope the maiden sisters may get a decent reward for their long years of patience  and expectation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  trembling fingers trifled nervously with the ornaments at her watch chain. It was  with difficulty that she could control her agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  to whom is the fortune left?&rdquo; she asked, breathlessly. &ldquo;Did you hear that, Gilbert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  my dear, it isn&rsquo;t usual to make the witness to a will acquainted with the body of  the deed. I saw poor Maurice de Crespigny execute his feeble autograph, and I put  my own muscular-looking signature in the place indicated to me, and I asked no questions.  It was enough for me to know that <em>I</em> had no interest in the document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  did Mr. de Crespigny say nothing&mdash;nothing that could lead you to guess who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.  de Crespigny said nothing whatever calculated to throw any light upon his intentions.  He seemed relieved by the idea that his will was made and the business settled.  Lawford wanted to carry off the document, but the old man insisted on keeping it  in his possession. He wished to look over it, he said. He wanted to see if his intentions  had been fully carried out, in the spirit as well as in the letter. He put the parchment  under his pillow, and then laid down with an air of satisfaction. I dare say he  has gone through the same little comedy again and again before to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he will destroy this will?&rdquo; Eleanor said, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>There  was a double danger of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s getting the fortune. He would get it  if it was bequeathed to him. He would take it as heir-at-law if his great-uncle  died without a will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Mr. Monckton answered, indifferently, &ldquo;the old man may change his mind again, if  he lives long enough to repent of this new will. But I doubt his surviving so long  as to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  have you no idea, Gilbert,&mdash;have you no idea as to whom the fortune is left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  is a question that concerns you, Laura,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a great deal more nearly than  it does us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  question?&rdquo; asked Miss Mason, looking up from an elaborate piece of embroidery which  she had been showing to Signora Picirillo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  are talking of Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune, my dear; you are interested in the disposal  of that, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, of course,&rdquo; answered the young lady, &ldquo;I ought to be interested for Launcelot&rsquo;s  sake, I know; and I know that he ought to have the fortune, and that nobody has  any right to deprive him of it, especially those nasty old maids who had him sent  to India against his will, and I dare say he will have horrid pains in his liver  from the climate when he&rsquo;s older. Of course he ought to have the fortune, and yet  sometimes I think it would be nicer for him to be poor. He may never be a great  artist if he&rsquo;s rich, perhaps; and I&rsquo;d rather go to Rome with him and sit by his  easel while he works, and pay the hotel bills, and the travelling expenses, and  all that sort of thing, out of my own money, than have him a country gentleman.  I shouldn&rsquo;t like him to be a country gentleman; he&rsquo;d have to hunt, and wear top-boots  and nasty leather gaiters, like a common ploughman, when he went out shooting. I  hate country gentlemen. Byron hasn&rsquo;t one country gentleman in all his poems, and  that horrid husband in Locksley Hall will show you what an opinion Tennyson has  of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason went back to the signora and the embroidery, satisfied with having settled  the business in her own manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  couldn&rsquo;t look like the Corsair if he had Woodlands,&rdquo; she murmured, despondently;  &ldquo;he&rsquo;d have to shave off his moustache if they made him a magistrate. What would  be the good of his talking seriously to poachers if he wore turned-down collars  and loose handkerchiefs round his neck? People would never respect him unless he  was a Guy; with creaky boots, and big seals hanging to his watch-chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  pushed the question still further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  think that Mr. de Crespigny has left his fortune to Launcelot Darrell, don&rsquo;t you,  Gilbert?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Her  husband, prompted by the evil spirit that was his occasional companion, looked at  her, rather suspiciously; but her eyes met his own with an unfaltering gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  are you so interested in this fortune, and in Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  tell you by-and-by. But tell me now, if you think the estate is left to Mr. Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  it scarcely unlikely that it is so. The fact of Maurice de Crespigny making a fresh  will within six months of the young man&rsquo;s return looks rather as if he had been  led to relent of some previous determination by the presence of his niece&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  Mr. de Crespigny has seen very little of Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not,&rdquo; answered Mr. Monckton, coldly. &ldquo;I may be quite wrong in my conjecture. You  ask for my opinion, and I give it you freely. Pray let us change the subject. I  hate the idea of all this speculation as to who shall stand in a dead man&rsquo;s shoes.  As far as Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s interests are concerned, I really think there is an  undercurrent of common sense in Laura&rsquo;s romantic talk. He may be all the better  for being a poor man. He may be all the better for having to go to Italy and work at  his art for a few years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton looked sharply at his young wife as he said this. I rather think that the  demon familiar had prompted this speech, and that the lawyer watched Eleanor&rsquo;s face  in the desire to discover whether there was anything unpleasant to her in the idea  of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s long absence from his native country.</p>
<p>But,  clever as Gilbert Monckton was, the mystery of his wife&rsquo;s face was as yet beyond  his power to read. He watched her in vain. The pale and thoughtful countenance told  nothing to the man who wanted the master key by which alone its expression could  be read.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
  Richard&rsquo;s Discovery</strong></h2>
<p>An almost ungovernable impulse prompted Eleanor Monckton to make her way at  once into Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s sick-chamber, and say to him, &ldquo;Launcelot Darrell  is the wretch who caused your old friend&rsquo;s cruel death. I call upon you, by the  memory of the past, to avenge that old friend&rsquo;s bitter wrongs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  struggle was a terrible one, but discretion in the end triumphed, and Eleanor submitted  herself to the guidance of her devoted slave and ally. She knew now that Launcelot  Darrell was guilty; but she had known that from the moment in which she had seen  him lounging in the Windsor Street.  The task that lay before her was to procure such proof as must be convincing to  the old man. In spite of her impetuous desire for immediate action, Eleanor was  compelled to acknowledge that the testimony of the sketch-book was not strong enough  in itself to condemn Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>The  young man&rsquo;s answer to any accusation brought against him on such evidence would  be simple enough.</p>
<p>Nothing  would be easier than for him to say, &ldquo;My name is not Robert Lance. The drawing abstracted  by unfair means from my portfolio is not mine. I am not responsible for the actions  of the man who made that sketch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  against this simple declaration there would be nothing but Eleanor&rsquo;s unsupported  assertion of the identity between the two men.</p>
<p>There  was nothing to be done, then, except to follow Richard Thornton&rsquo;s advice, and wait.</p>
<p>This  waiting was very weary work. Estranged from her husband by the secret of her life,&mdash;unhappy  in the society of Laura Mason, against whose happiness she felt that she was, in  a manner, plotting; restrained and ill at ease even in the familiar companionship  of Eliza Picirillo,&mdash;Eleanor Monckton wandered about the great rambling mansion which  had become her home, restless and unhappy, yearning with a terrible impatience for  the coming of the end, however dark that end might be. Every day, and often more  than once in the course of the day, she locked herself in her room, and opened the  desk in which she kept Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s sketches and her dead father&rsquo;s last letter.  She looked at these things almost as if she feared that by some diabolical influence  they might be taken from her before they had served as the instruments of her revenge.  So the weary days wore themselves out. The first week of Richard&rsquo;s visit; the second  week of Richard&rsquo;s visit passed by; the middle of February came, and nothing more  had been done.</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  health began to suffer from the perpetual mental fever of anxiety and impatience.  Her husband saw her day by day growing thinner and paler; a hectic flush crimsoned  her cheek now at every trifling agitation, with every surprise, however insignificant;  but, except for these transient blushes, her face was as colourless as marble.</p>
<p>Her  husband saw this, and made himself miserable because of the change in his young  wife. He made himself still more wretched by reason of those unworthy doubts and  suspicions that were for ever torturing him. &ldquo;Why was Eleanor ill? Why was she unhappy?&rdquo;  He asked himself this latter question a thousand times a day, and always answered  it more or less after the same fashion.</p>
<p>She  was unhappy because of the swiftly approaching marriage between Laura Mason and  Launcelot Darrell. She had opposed that marriage with all the power she possessed.  She had over-estimated her own fortitude when she sacrificed her love for the young  artist to her desire to win a brilliant position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  should she be different from other women?&rdquo; the lawyer thought. &ldquo;She has married  me for my money, and she is sorry for what she has done, and perhaps upon the eve  of poor Laura&rsquo;s wedding day, there will be a repetition of the scene that took place  at Lausanne eighteen  years ago.&rdquo; This was the manner of meditation to which Mr. Monckton abandoned himself  when the black mood was upon him.</p>
<p>All  this time Launcelot Darrell came backwards and forwards between Hazlewood and Tolldale,  after the free-and-easy manner of an accepted lover, who feels that, whatever advantages  he may obtain by the matrimonial treaty which he is about to form, his own transcendent  merits are so far above every meaner consideration as to render the lady the gainer  by the bargain.</p>
<p>He came,  therefore, whenever it pleased him to come. Now dawdling away a morning over the  piano with Laura Mason; now playing billiards with Richard Thornton, who associated  with him as it were under protest, hating him most cordially all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  detectives must have a hard time of it,&rdquo; reflected Mr. Thornton, after one of these  mornings. &ldquo;Imagine having to hob-and-nob with a William Palmer, on the chance of  his dropping out a word or two that might help to bring him to the gallows. The  profession is extremely honourable, no doubt, but I don&rsquo;t think it can be a very  pleasant one. I fancy, upon the whole, a muddy crossing and a good broom must be  more agreeable to a man&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  15th of February came, dark, cold, and dreary, and Eleanor reminded the scene-painter  that only one month now remained before the day appointed for Laura&rsquo;s marriage.  That young lady, absorbed amongst a chaos of ribbons and laces, silks and velvets,  had ceased to feel any jealousy of her guardian&rsquo;s wife. Her lover&rsquo;s easy acceptance  of her devotion was sufficient for her happiness. What should the Corsair do but  twist his black moustachios and permit Medora to worship him?</p>
<p>It was  on this very 15th of February that, for the first time since the visit to Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s studio, Mr. Richard Thornton made a discovery.</p>
<p>It was  not a very important one, perhaps, nor did it bear directly upon the secret of the  artist&rsquo;s life, but it was something.</p>
<p>The  scene-painter left Tolldale soon after breakfast upon this bleak February day, in  a light dog-cart which Mr. Monckton placed at the disposal of such of his guests  who might wish to explore the neighbouring country. He did not return until dusk,  and broke in upon Eleanor&rsquo;s solitude as the shadows were gathering outside the window  of the room in which she sat. He found his old companion alone in a little morning-room,  next her husband&rsquo;s study. She was sitting on a low stool by the hearth, her head  resting on her hands, and the red firelight on her face; her attitude altogether  expressive of care and despondency.</p>
<p>The  door of communication between Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s study and the room in which Eleanor  sat was closed.</p>
<p>The  girl started and looked up as Richard Thornton opened the door. The day had been  wet as well as cold; drops of rain and sleet hung about the young man&rsquo;s rough great-coat,  and he brought a damp and chilly atmosphere into the room. Eleanor took very little  notice of his return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  it you, Richard?&rdquo; she said, absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs. Monckton, I have been out all day; I have been to Windsor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I met Launcelot Darrell there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  met Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; repeated Eleanor. &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; she cried, suddenly, rising  as she spoke, and going to where the young man stood, &ldquo;you have found out something  more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  not found what we want, Eleanor. I have not found the proof that you must lay before  Mr. de Crespigny, when you ask him to disinherit his nephew. But I think I have  made a discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  discovery?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Monckton, with suppressed eagerness; &ldquo;do not speak loudly,  Dick,&rdquo; she added, in a hurried whisper, &ldquo;my husband is in the next room. I sit with  him sometimes when he is at work there with his law papers, but I can&rsquo;t help fancying  that my presence annoys him. He is not the same to me that he used to be. Oh, Richard,  Richard, I feel as if I was divided from every creature in the world, except you:  I can trust you, for you know my secret. When will this end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  soon, my dear, I hope,&rdquo; Mr. Thornton answered, gravely. &ldquo;There was a time when I  urged you to abandon your purpose, Eleanor, but I do so no longer. Launcelot Darrell  is a bad man, and the poor little girl with the blue eyes and flaxen ringlets must  not be suffered to fall into his power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no, not for the world. But you have made some discovery to-day, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  so. You remember what Mr. Monckton told us the other day. You remember his telling  us that Mr. de Crespigny had only that day made his will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I remember it perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura  Mason was present when her guardian told us this. It is only natural she should  tell Launcelot Darrell what had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  tells him everything; she would be sure to tell him that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,  and Mr. Darrell has not been slow to act upon the hint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean  that Launcelot Darrell has been guilty of the baseness of bribing Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s  clerk, in order to find out the secret of the contents of that will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you know this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I discovered  it by the merest chance. You owe me no praises, Eleanor. I begin to think that the  science of detection is, after all, very weak and imperfect; and that the detective  officer owes many of his greatest triumphs to patience, and a series of happy accidents.  Yes, Eleanor, Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s eagerness, or avarice, whichever you will, would not  suffer him to wait until his great uncle&rsquo;s death. He was determined to know the  contents of that will; and, whatever the knowledge has cost him, I fancy he is scarcely  satisfied with his bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I believe that he is disinherited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was a noise as of the movement of a heavy chair in the next room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo;  Eleanor whispered; &ldquo;my husband is going to dress for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bell  rang while she was speaking, and Richard heard the door of the next room opened  and shut.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
  What Happened At Windsor</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated Richard  Thornton, &ldquo;I have reason to believe that the will witnessed by your husband is a  very unpleasant piece of literature in the estimation of Launcelot Darrell, for  I fancy that it cuts him off without even the meagre consolation of that solitary  shilling which is usually inherited by unhappy elder sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  tell me why you think this, Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,  my dear Mrs. Monckton. The story is rather a long one, but I think I can tell it  in a quarter of an hour. Can you dress for dinner in the other quarter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a nuisance civilisation is, Nelly. We never dressed for dinner in the Pilasters;  indeed, the fashion amongst the leading families in that locality leans rather the  other way. The gentlemen in the cab and chimney line generally take off their coats  when the mid-day meal is announced in order to dine in their shirt-sleeves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard,  Richard!&rdquo; cried Eleanor, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  well, Mrs. Monckton, seriously, you shall have my Windsor adventures. I hate this man Launcelot  Darrell, for I believe he is a shallow, selfish, cold-hearted coxcomb, or else I  don&rsquo;t think I could have brought myself to do what I&rsquo;ve done to-day. I&rsquo;ve been playing  the spy, Eleanor, for a couple of hours at least. The Duke of Otranto used to find  plenty of people for this kind of work,&mdash;artists, actors, actresses, priests, women,  every creature whom you would least suspect of baseness. But they manage these things  better in France.  We don&rsquo;t take to the business so readily upon this side of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  girl&rsquo;s impatience was almost uncontrollable. She watched the hands of a little clock  upon the chimney-piece: the firelight flashed every now and then upon the dial,  and then faded out, leaving it dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  coming to the story, Nell, if you&rsquo;ll only be patient,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr. Thornton.  He was getting over that secret sorrow which he had nursed for such a long time  in the lowest depths of a most true and faithful breast. He was growing reconciled  to the Inevitable; as we all must, sooner or later; and he had reassumed that comfortable  brotherly familiarity which had been so long habitual to him in his intercourse  with Eleanor. &ldquo;Only be patient, my dear, and let me tell my story my own way,&rdquo; he  pleaded. &ldquo;I left here early this morning in your husband&rsquo;s dog-cart, intending to  drive over to Windsor  and amuse myself by exploring the town, and the castle, if possible, to see if there  was anything in my way to be picked up&mdash;donjon keeps, turret staircases, secret corridors,  and so on, you know. You know what sort of a morning it was, bleak and dismal enough,  but until twelve o&rsquo;clock no rain. It was within a quarter of an hour of twelve when  I got into Windsor, and the rain was just beginning, spiteful drops of rain and  particles of sleet, that came down obliquely and cut into your face like so many  needle-points. I stopped at an inn in a perpendicular street below the castle, which  looks as if it means to topple down and annihilate this part of the town some of  these days. I put up the dog-cart, and asked a few questions about the possibility  of getting admission to the royal dwelling-place. Of course I was informed that  such admission was to-day utterly impracticable. I could have seen the state apartments  yesterday. I could see them, most likely, by the end of next week, but I couldn&rsquo;t  see them when I wanted to see them. I hinted that my chief desire was to see secret  passages, donjon keeps, moats, and sliding panels; but neither the landlord nor  the waiter seemed to understand me, and I sat down rather despondently by the window  of the tavern parlour to wait till the rain was over, and I could go out and prowl  upon the castle terrace to study wintry effects in the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  Launcelot Darrell, Richard&mdash;where did you meet Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  coming to him presently. The perpendicular street wasn&rsquo;t particularly lively upon  this wretched February day; so, as there weren&rsquo;t any passers-by to look at, I amused  myself by looking at the houses facing the inn. Immediately opposite to me there  was a house very superior to the others in style&mdash;a red brick house of the Georgian  era, modernised by plate-glass windows and green blinds&mdash;not a large house, but eminently  respectable. A dazzling brass plate adorned the door, and upon this brass plate,  which winked and twinkled in the very face of the rain, I read the name of Mr. Henry  Lawford, solicitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  lawyer who made Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.  Upon one side of the door there was a bell-handle inscribed Visitors, on the other  a duplicate handle inscribed Office. I hadn&rsquo;t been looking at the house above five  minutes, when a young man, with a slender silk umbrella, struggling against the  wind, rang the office-bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  young man was Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo; Eleanor cried, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  was. The door was opened by a boy, of whom Mr. Darrell asked several questions.  Whatever the answers were, he walked away, and the door was shut. But from his manner  of strolling slowly along the street, I was convinced that he was not going far,  and that he meant to come back. People don&rsquo;t usually stroll in a sharp rain that  comes down obliquely and seems to drift in your face from every point of the compass.  He&rsquo;ll come back presently, I thought; so I ordered a bottle of pale ale and I waited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  he came back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  he came back in about half an hour; but, ten minutes or so before he returned, I  saw a shabby-genteel, elderly man let himself in with a latch-key at a small green  side door with &lsquo;Clerk&rsquo;s Office&rsquo; painted in white letters on the panel. I knew by  the look of this man that he must be a clerk. There&rsquo;s a look about an attorney&rsquo;s  clerk that you can&rsquo;t mistake, even when he doesn&rsquo;t carry a blue bag; and this man  did carry one. Ten minutes afterwards Launcelot Darrell returned. This time he knocked  with the handle of his umbrella at the green door, which was opened by the boy,  who went to fetch the elderly clerk. This elderly clerk and Mr. Darrell stood on  the door-step talking confidentially for about five minutes, and then our friend  the artist went away; but this time again strolled slowly through the rain; as if  he had a certain interval to dispose of, and scarcely knew what to do with himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose  the amateur detective business fills a man&rsquo;s mind with all manner of suspicious  fancies, Eleanor. However that may be, I could not help thinking that there was  something queer in these two visits of Launcelot Darrell to the red brick house  opposite me. What did he want with a lawyer, in the first place? and if he did want  a lawyer, why didn&rsquo;t he go straight to Mr. Lawford, who was at home&mdash;for I could  see his head across the top of the wire blind in one of the plate-glass windows  as he bent over his desk&mdash;instead of tampering with small boys and clerks? There  was something mysterious in the manner of his hanging about the place; and as I  had been watching him wearily for a long time without being able to find out anything  mysterious in his conduct, I determined to make the most of my chances and watch  him to some purpose to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll come back,&rsquo;  I thought, &lsquo;unless I&rsquo;m very much mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  very much mistaken, for Launcelot Darrell did not come back; but a few minutes after  the clock struck one, the green door opened, and the elderly clerk came out, without  the blue bag this time, and walked nimbly up the street in the direction that Launcelot  Darrell had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to his  dinner,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;or he&rsquo;s going to meet Launcelot Darrell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put  on my hat, and went out of the house. The clerk was toiling up the perpendicular  street a good way ahead of me, but I managed to keep him in sight and to be close  upon his heels when he turned the corner into the street below the towers of the  castle. He walked a little way along this street, and then went into one of the  principal hotels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, my friend!&rsquo; I  said, to myself, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t ordinarily take your dinner at that house, I imagine.  It&rsquo;s a cut above your requirements, I should think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went  into the hotel, and made my way to the coffee-room. Mr. Launcelot Darrell and the  shabby genteel clerk were sitting at a table drinking sherry and soda-water. The  artist was talking to his companion in a low voice, and very earnestly. It was not  difficult to see that he was trying to persuade the seedy clerk to something which  the clerk&rsquo;s sense of caution revolted from. Both men looked up as I went into the  room, which they had had all to themselves until that moment; and Launcelot Darrell  flushed scarlet as he recognised me. It was evident, therefore, that he did not  care to be seen in the company of Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good morning, Mr.  Darrell,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come over to have a look at the castle, but I find strangers  are not admitted to-day, so I&rsquo;m obliged to content myself with walking about in  the wet for an hour or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot  Darrell answered me in that patronising manner which renders him so delightful to  the people he considers inferior to himself. He had quite recovered from the confusion  my sudden appearance had caused, and muttered something about Mr. Lawford, the attorney,  and &lsquo;business.&rsquo; Then he sat biting his nails in an uncomfortable and restless manner,  while I drank another bottle of pale ale. That&rsquo;s another objection to the detective  business; it involves such a lot of drinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left  the hotel, and left Mr. Darrell and the clerk together; but I didn&rsquo;t go very far.  I contrived somehow or other to be especially interested in that part of the exterior  of the castle visible from the street in which the hotel is situated, and in a manner,  kept one eye upon the stately towers of the royal residence, and the other upon  the doorway out of which Launcelot Darrell and Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s clerk must by-and-by  emerge. In about half an hour I had the satisfaction of seeing them appear, and  contrived, most innocently of course, to throw myself exactly in their way at the  corner of the perpendicular street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  amply rewarded for any trouble that I had taken; for I never saw a face that so  plainly expressed rage, mortification, disappointment, almost despair, as did the  face of Launcelot Darrell, when I came against him at the street corner. He was  as white as a sheet, and he scowled at me savagely as he passed me by. Not as if  he recognised me; the fixed look in his face showed that his mind was too much absorbed  in one thought for any consciousness of exterior things; but as if in his suppressed  fury he was ready to go blindly against anybody or anything that came in his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  why, Richard, why was he so angry?&rdquo; cried Eleanor, with her hands clenched and her  nostrils quivering with the passage of her rapid breath. &ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless  I&rsquo;m very much mistaken, Mrs. Monckton, it means that Launcelot Darrell has been  tampering with the clerk of the lawyer who drew up Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s last will,  and that he now knows the worst&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  that is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  plain fact, that unless that will is altered the brilliant Mr. Darrell will not  inherit a penny of his kinsman&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  second dinner bell rang while Richard was speaking, and Eleanor rushed from the  room to make some hurried change in her toilette, and to appear in the drawing-room,  agitated and ill at ease, ten minutes after Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s punctilious butler had  made his formal announcement of the principal meal of the day.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36<br>
  Another Recognition</strong></h2>
<p>Launcelot Darrell came to Tolldale Priory upon the day after Richard&rsquo;s visit  to Windsor, and  it was easy for Eleanor, assisted by her knowledge of what had transpired, to see  the change in his manner. She spent an hour in the drawing-room that morning for  the purpose of seeing this change, and thereby finding confirmation of that which  Richard Thornton had told her. But the alteration in the young man&rsquo;s manner must  have been very obvious, for even Laura, who was not particularly observant of any  shades of feeling that did not make themselves manifest by the outward expression  of word or gesture, perceived that there was something amiss with her lover, and  drove Launcelot Darrell well-nigh mad with her childish questionings and lamentations.</p>
<p>Why  was he so quiet? Why was he so much paler than usual? Why did he sigh sometimes?  Why did he laugh in that strange way? Oh, no, not in his usual way. It was no use  saying that it was so. Had he a headache? Had he been sitting up late at night?  Had he been drinking horrid wine that had disagreed with him? Had he been a naughty,  naughty, cruel, false, treacherous boy, and had he been to some party that he hadn&rsquo;t  told his poor Laura about, drinking champagne, and flirting with girls, and dancing,  and all that? Or had he been working too much at his Rosalind and Celia?</p>
<p>With  such questions as these did the young lady harass and torment her lover throughout  that uncomfortable February morning; until at last Mr. Darrell turned upon her in  a rage, declaring that his head was nearly split asunder, and plainly telling her  to hold her tongue.</p>
<p>Indeed,  Mr. Launcelot Darrell made very little effort to disguise his feelings, but sat  over the fire in a low easy chair, with his elbows resting on his knees and his  handsome dark eyes bent moodily upon the blaze. He roused himself now and then from  a fit of gloomy thought to snatch up the polished-steel poker, and plunge it savagely  amongst the coals, as if it was some relief to him to punish even them. Another  man might have feared the inferences which spectators might draw from his conduct,  but the principle upon which Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s life had been based involved an  utter contempt for almost every living creature except himself, and he apprehended  no danger from the watchfulness of the inferior beings about him.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason, sitting on a low ottoman at his feet, and employed in working a pair of embroidered  slippers&mdash;the third pair she had begun for the use of her future lord and master&mdash;thought  him more like the Corsair to-day than ever; but thought at the same time that some  periods of Medora&rsquo;s existence must have been rather dreary. No doubt it was Conrad&rsquo;s  habit to sit and stare at the coals, and to poke the fire savagely when things went  amiss with him; when his favourite barque was scuttled by a mutinous crew, or his  cargo confiscated by the minions of the law.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell was engaged to dine at the Priory upon this 16th of February. Mr. Monckton  had invited him, in order that some matters connected with Laura&rsquo;s fortune might  be discussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is time we should fully understand each other, Darrell,&rdquo; the lawyer said; &ldquo;so I  shall expect you to give me a couple of hours in my study this evening after dinner,  if you&rsquo;ve no objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course  Mr. Darrell had no objection, but he had an almost spiteful manner that day in his  intercourse with poor Laura, who was bewildered by the change in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  think it&rsquo;s strange that I should dislike all this ceremony about settlements and  allowance. Yes, Laura, that&rsquo;s a pleasant word, isn&rsquo;t it? Your guardian honoured  me by telling me he should make us a handsome allowance for the first few years  of our married life. You think I ought to take kindly to this sort of thing, I dare  say, and drop quietly into my position of genteel pauperism, dependent upon my pencil,  or my wife, for the dinner I eat and the coat I wear. No, Laura,&rdquo; cried the young  man, passionately, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take kindly to it; I can&rsquo;t stand it. The thought of  my position enrages me against myself, against you, against everybody and everything  in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell talked thus to his betrothed while Richard and Eleanor were both in the  room; the scene-painter sitting in a window making furtive sketches with a fat little  stump of lead pencil upon the backs of divers letters; Mrs. Monckton standing at  another window looking out at the leafless trees, the black flowerless garden beds,  the rain-drops hanging on the dingy firs and evergreens.</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell knew that he was overheard; but he had no wish that it should be otherwise.  He did not care to keep his grievances a secret. The egotism of his nature exhibited  itself in this. He gave himself the airs of a victim, and made a show of despising  the benefits he was about to accept from his confiding betrothed. He in a manner  proclaimed himself injured by the existence of his future wife&rsquo;s fortune; and he  forced her to apologise to him for the prosperity which she was about to bestow  upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  if it was being a pauper to take my money,&rdquo; cried Miss Mason, with great tenderness,  albeit in rather obscure English; &ldquo;as if I grudged you the horrid money, Launcelot.  Why, I don&rsquo;t even know how much I&rsquo;m to have. It may be fifty pounds a-year&mdash;that&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;ve had to buy my dresses and things since I was fifteen&mdash;or it may be fifty  thousand. I don&rsquo;t want to know how much it is. If it <em>is</em> fifty thousand a-year,  you&rsquo;re welcome to it, Launcelot, darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot  darling&rdquo; shrugged his shoulders with a peevish gesture which exhibited him as rather  a discontented darling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  talk like a baby, Laura,&rdquo; he said, contemptuously; &ldquo;I suppose the &lsquo;handsome allowance&rsquo;  Mr. Monckton promises will be about two or three hundred a-year, or so; something  that I&rsquo;m to eke out by my industry. Heaven knows he has preached to me enough about  the necessity of being industrious. One would think that an artist was a bricklayer  or a stonemason, to hear him talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  turned away from the window as Launcelot Darrell said this; she could not suffer  her husband to be undefended while she was by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  no doubt whatever Gilbert said was right, Mr. Darrell,&rdquo; she exclaimed, lifting her  head proudly, as if in defiance of any voice that should gainsay her husband&rsquo;s merits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  doubt, Mrs. Monckton; but there&rsquo;s a certain sledge-hammer-like way of propounding  that which is right that isn&rsquo;t always pleasant. I don&rsquo;t want to be reminded that  an artist&rsquo;s calling is a trade, and that when the Graces bless me with a happy thought,  I must work like a slave until I&rsquo;ve hammered it out upon canvas and sent it into  the market for sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some  people think the Graces are propitiated by hard labour,&rdquo; Richard Thornton said,  quietly, without raising his eyes from his rapid pencil, &ldquo;and that the happiest  thoughts are apt to come when a man has his brush in his hand, rather than when  he&rsquo;s lying on a sofa reading French novels; and I&rsquo;ve known artists who preferred  that method of waiting for inspiration. For my own part, I believe in the inspiration  that grows out of patient labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Mr. Darrell answered, with an air of lazy indifference&mdash;an air which plainly expressed  that he disdained to discuss art-topics with a scene-painter, &ldquo;I dare say you find  it answer&mdash;in your line. You must splash over a good deal of canvas before you can  produce a transformation scene, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter  Paul Rubens got over a good deal of canvas,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and Raffaelle Sanzio  d&rsquo;Urbino did something in that way, if we may judge by the cartoons and a few other  trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course, there were giants in those days. I don&rsquo;t aspire to rival any such Patagonians.  I don&rsquo;t see why people should be compelled to walk through a picture gallery a mile  long before they can pronounce an opinion upon a painter&rsquo;s merits. I should be very  well contented if my chance with posterity rested upon half-a-dozen pictures no  bigger than Millais&rsquo;s &lsquo;Huguenot;&rsquo; and as good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;m sure you could do dozens and dozens as good as that,&rdquo; cried Laura. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s  only a lady tying a scarf round her lover&rsquo;s arm, and a lot of green leaves. Of course  it&rsquo;s very pretty, you know, and one feels very much for her, poor thing, and one&rsquo;s  afraid that he&rsquo;ll let those cruel Catholics kill him, and that she&rsquo;ll die broken-hearted.  But you could paint lots of pictures like that, Launcelot, if you chose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man did not condescend to notice his affianced wife&rsquo;s art-criticism. He relapsed  into gloomy silence, and once more betook himself to that savage kind of consolation  afforded by a sturdy exercise of the poker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  Launcelot,&rdquo; pleaded Miss Mason, presently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you needn&rsquo;t be unhappy about  my having money, and you&rsquo;re being poor. There&rsquo;s Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune, you  know; he can&rsquo;t be shameful and wicked enough to leave it to any one but you. My  guardian said, only the other day, that he thought it would be left to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  ah, to be sure,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Darrell, moodily; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s <em>that</em> chance, of  course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  couldn&rsquo;t leave Woodlands to those two old maids, you know, Launcelot, could he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the  surprise of the two listeners, Richard Thornton and Eleanor, the young man burst  into a harsh disdainful laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  respected maiden aunts!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;poor devils, they&rsquo;ve had a nice time of  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until  this moment Richard and Eleanor had most firmly believed that the will which disinherited  Launcelot Darrell bequeathed the Woodlands fortune to the two maiden sisters, Lavinia  and Sarah de Crespigny; but the young man&rsquo;s disdainful laugh, and the contemptuous,  yet half pitying tone in which he spoke of the two sisters, plainly revealed that  if he knew the secret of the disposal of Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune, and knew  that it was not left to himself, he knew also that equal disappointment and mortification  awaited his aunts.</p>
<p>He had  been in the habit of speaking of them with a savage though suppressed animosity.  Today his tone was utterly changed. He had a malicious pleasure, no doubt, in thinking  of the disappointment in store for them; and he could afford now to feel a kind  of disdainful compassion for all their wasted labours, their useless patience.</p>
<p>But  to whom, then, could the fortune be left?</p>
<p>Eleanor  and Richard looked at each other in amazement. It might have been supposed that  the old man had left his wealth to Eleanor herself, influenced by the caprice that  had induced him to attach himself to her, because of her likeness to his dead friend.  But this could not be, for the invalid had distinctly declared that he should leave  nothing but George Vane&rsquo;s miniature to his new favourite, and Maurice de Crespigny  was not a man to say one thing and mean another. He had spoken of a duty to be fulfilled,  a duty which he was determined to perform.</p>
<p>Yet,  to whom could he possibly owe any duty, except to his kindred? Had he any other  relations except his three nieces and Launcelot Darrell? He might have other claims  upon him. He might have some poor and modest kindred who had kept aloof from him  and refrained from paying court to him, and whose forbearance he might choose to  reward in an unlooked-for, unthought-of manner.</p>
<p>And  again, he might have bequeathed his money to some charitable institution, or in  trust for some new scheme of philanthropy. Such a course would scarcely be strange  in a lonely old man, who in his nearest relations might only recognise eager, expectant  harpies keeping anxious watch for the welcome hour of his death.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton did not trouble herself much about this question. She believed from Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s manner, that Richard Thornton had drawn the right inference from the meeting  of the young man and the lawyer&rsquo;s clerk.</p>
<p>She  believed implicitly that Launcelot Darrell was disinherited by his great-uncle&rsquo;s  last will, and that he knew it.</p>
<p>This  belief inspired her with a new feeling. She could afford to be patient now. If Maurice  de Crespigny should die suddenly, he would not die leaving his wealth to enrich  the traitor who had cheated a helpless old man. Her only thought now must be to  prevent Laura&rsquo;s marriage; and for this she must look to her husband, Gilbert Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  will never let the girl whose destiny has been confided to him, marry a bad man,&rdquo;  she thought; &ldquo;I have only to tell him the story of my father&rsquo;s death, and to prove  to him Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  dinner went off very quietly. Mr. Monckton was reserved and silent, as it had lately  become his habit to be. Launcelot Darrell had still the gloomy, discontented air  that had made him a very unpleasant companion throughout that day. The young man  was not a hypocrite, and had no power of concealing his feelings. He could tell  any number of lies that might be necessary for his own convenience or safety, but  he was not a hypocrite. Hypocrisy involves a great deal of trouble on the part of  those who practise it; and is, moreover, the vice of a man who sets no little value  upon the opinion of his fellow-creatures. Mr. Darrell was of a listless and easy  temperament, and nourished an utter abhorrence of all work, either physical or mental.  On the other hand, he had so good an opinion of himself as to be tolerably indifferent  to the opinions of others.</p>
<p>If he  had been accused of a crime, he would have denied having committed it for his own  sake. But he never troubled himself to consider what other people might think of  him, so long as their opinion had no power to affect his personal comfort or safety.</p>
<p>The  cloth had been removed, for old fashions held their ground at Tolldale Priory, where  a dinner<em> &agrave; la Russe</em>, would have been looked upon as an absurd institution,  more like children playing at a feast, than sensible people bent upon enjoying a  substantial meal. The cloth had been removed, and that dreary ceremonial, a good  old English dessert was in progress, when a servant brought Launcelot Darrell a  card upon a salver, and presented it to him solemnly amid the silence of the company.</p>
<p>The  young man was sitting next Eleanor Monckton, and she saw that the card was of a  highly glazed and slippery nature, and of an abnormal size, between the ordinary  sizes of a gentleman&rsquo;s and a lady&rsquo;s card.</p>
<p>The  blood rushed to Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s forehead as he read the name upon the card,  and Eleanor saw his under lip contract with a sudden movement, expressive of intense  vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  did this&mdash;this gentleman come here?&rdquo; he asked, turning to the servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  gentleman has driven over from Hazlewood, sir. Hearing you were dining here, he  came on to see you, he says; is he to be shown into the drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no;  I&rsquo;ll come out and see him. Will you excuse me, Mr. Monckton: this is an old acquaintance  of mine? Rather a pertinacious acquaintance, as you may perceive by his manner of  following me up to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell rose, pushed aside his chair, and went out of the dining-room, followed  by the servant.</p>
<p>The  hall was brilliantly lighted, and in the few moments during which the servant slowly  followed Launcelot Darrell, Eleanor had an opportunity of seeing the stranger who  had come to the Priory.</p>
<p>He was  standing under the light of the large gas-lamp, shaking the rain-drops from his  hat, and with his face turned towards the dining-room door.</p>
<p>He was  short and stout, smartly dressed, and foppish-looking even in his travelling costume;  and he was no other than the talkative Frenchman who had persuaded George Vane to  leave his daughter alone upon the Boulevard on the night of August 11th, 1853.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37<br>
  Launcelot&rsquo;s Troubles</strong></h2>
<p>Eleanor Monckton sat looking at the door which had closed upon the scene  in the lamp-lit hall, almost as if the intensity of her gaze could have pierced  the solid oaken panel and revealed to her that which was taking place outside the  dining-room.</p>
<p>Richard  Thornton and her husband, both watching her face, wondered at the sudden change  in its expression,&mdash;the look of rapt wonder and amazement that had come over it from  the moment in which Launcelot Darrell had gone out into the hall. Richard guessed  that something strange and unexpected had occurred, but Gilbert Monckton, who was  quite in the dark as to his wife&rsquo;s feelings, could only stare blankly at her face,  and mutely wonder at the mystery which tortured him. Laura Mason, who had been throughout  the day alarmed by her lover&rsquo;s manner, was too anxious about Launcelot Darrell to  observe the face of her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure there&rsquo;s something wrong,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there is, Mr. Monckton. You don&rsquo;t  know how Launcelot&rsquo;s been going on all day, frightening me out of my wits. Hasn&rsquo;t  he now, Eleanor? Hasn&rsquo;t he, Mr. Thornton? Saying he won&rsquo;t be a pauper, dependent  upon his wife, and that you&rsquo;ve wounded his feelings by talking about Art as if you  were a bricklayer; or as if he was a bricklayer, I forget which. I had a presentiment  all day that something was going to happen; and Launcelot did go on so, staring  at the fire, and hammering the coals, and sighing as if he had something awful on  his mind&mdash;as if he&rsquo;d committed a crime, you know, and was brooding over it,&rdquo; added  the young lady, with an evident relish of the last idea.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton looked contemptuously at his ward. The girl&rsquo;s frivolous babble was in horrible  discord with his own anxiety&mdash;a kind of parody of his own alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by committing crimes, Laura?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll never learn  to talk like a reasonable being. Is there anything so very miraculous in the fact  that some old acquaintance of Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s has come down to Berkshire  to see him, and that, having taken so much trouble, he scarcely cares to go back <em>without</em> seeing him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura  Mason breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think, then, that Launcelot has done something dreadful, and that this man  has come to arrest him!&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It seems so odd his coming here on a dark winter&rsquo;s  night; and Launcelot looked angry when he saw the card the servant gave him. I&rsquo;m  sure it&rsquo;s something dreadful. Let&rsquo;s go into the drawing-room, Eleanor. We shall  have to pass through the hall, and if there&rsquo;s anything wrong we can find out all  about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  started as Laura addressed her, and rose suddenly, aroused by the necessity of having  to attend to something that had been said to her, but scarcely knowing what that  something was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo;  exclaimed her husband, &ldquo;how pale you are, and how strangely you look at that door.  One would think that you were influenced by Laura&rsquo;s absurd fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I&rsquo;m not frightened of anything; only I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  paused, hesitating, and looking down in painful embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only  what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happened  to see the person who has come to speak to Mr. Darrell, and&mdash;and&mdash;his face reminded  me of a man I saw a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard  looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  was there anything so very startling in the mere coincidence of a likeness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, nothing startling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon  my word, Eleanor,&rdquo; exclaimed Gilbert Monckton, impatiently, &ldquo;we seem to live in  an atmosphere of mystery, which, to say the least of it, is far from agreeable to  those who are only honoured with the post of lookers-on. There, there, go to the  drawing-room with Laura. Mr. Thornton and I will follow you almost immediately.  We shall have very little pleasure in sitting over our wine, with a consciousness  that a kind of Gunpowder Plot is going on in the hall outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer filled his glass with claret, and pushed the crystal jug towards Richard;  but he left the wine untasted before him, and he sat silently brooding over his  suspicions with a bent brow and rigidly-compressed lips.</p>
<p>It was  no use to struggle against his destiny, he thought. Life was to be always a dreary  French novel, in which he was to play the husband and the victim. He had loved and  trusted this girl. He had seen innocence and candour beaming in her face, and he  had dared to believe in her; and from the very hour of her marriage a horrible transformation  had taken place in this frank and fearless creature. A hundred changes of expression,  all equally mysterious to him, had converted the face he loved into a wearisome  and incomprehensible enigma, which it was the torment of his life to endeavour vainly  and hopelessly to guess. Richard Thornton opened the door, and Eleanor gladly made  her escape from the dining-room, holding Laura&rsquo;s hand in hers, and with the Signora  following close behind her. The three women entered the hall in a group, and stood  for a moment looking at Launcelot Darrell and the stranger.</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell stood near the open hall-door with his hands in his pockets, and his head  bent in that sulky attitude which Eleanor had good reason to remember. The stranger,  smoothing the wet nap of his hat with a careful hand, seemed to be talking in a  tone of remonstrance, and, as it were, urging something upon his companion. This  was only to be guessed by the expression of his face, as the voice in which he spoke  was scarcely above a whisper.</p>
<p>The  three ladies crossed the hall and went into the drawing-room. Eleanor had no need  to confirm her sudden recognition of the Frenchman by any second scrutiny of his  face. She sat down near the broad hearth, and began to think how this man&rsquo;s unlooked-for  coming might affect the fulfilment of her purpose. Would he be likely to thwart  her? or could he not, perhaps, be induced to help her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must  talk to Richard,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He knows the world better than I do. I am almost  as much a child as Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While  Mrs. Monckton sat looking absently at the fire, and trying to imagine how the advent  of the Frenchman might be made subservient to the scheme of her life, Miss Mason  burst into a torrent of panegyric upon the stranger&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  such a good-natured-looking dear,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;with curly hair and a mustache  just like the Emperor&rsquo;s; and the idea of my frightening myself so about him, and  thinking he was a dreadful creature in a slouched hat, and with his coat collar  turned up to hide his face, come to arrest Launcelot for some awful crime. I&rsquo;m not  a bit frightened now, and I hope Launcelot will bring him in to tea. The idea of  his being a foreigner, too. I think foreigners are <em>so</em> interesting. Don&rsquo;t  you, Nelly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton looked up at the sound of her name. She had not heard a word that Laura  had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,  dear?&rdquo; she asked, listlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think foreigners interesting, Nelly?&rdquo; repeated the young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting?  No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What;  not Frenchmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton gave a faint shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frenchmen!&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t like them, I&mdash; How do I know, Laura? baseness and treachery  belong to no peculiar people, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton and the scene-painter came into the drawing-room at this moment, followed  pretty closely by Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  have you done with your friend, Darrell?&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton asked, with a look of  surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; the young man answered indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  let him go, without asking him to rest, or take some refreshment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I contrived to get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t usually &lsquo;contrive to get rid&rsquo; of people when they come here on a wet winter  night,&rdquo; said Mr. Monckton. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give Tolldale Priory a name for inhospitality,  I fear. Why didn&rsquo;t you ask your friend to stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I didn&rsquo;t care to introduce him to you,&rdquo; Launcelot Darrell answered coolly; &ldquo;I never  said he was a friend of mine. He&rsquo;s only an acquaintance, and a very intrusive acquaintance.  He had no right to ferret out my whereabouts, and to come down here after me. A  man doesn&rsquo;t want past associations forced upon him, however agreeable they may have  been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  still less when those associations are disagreeable. I understand. But who is this  man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a Frenchman, a <em>commis voyageur</em>, or something of that kind; by no means a  distinguished acquaintance. He&rsquo;s a good fellow, in his own particular fashion, and  would go out of his way to do me a service, I dare say; but he&rsquo;s rather too fond  of absinthe, or brandy, or any other spirit he can get hold of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  mean that he is a drunkard,&rdquo; said Mr. Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  say that. But I know that the poor devil has had more than one attack of delirium  tremens in the course of his life. He&rsquo;s over here in the interests of a patent mustard,  I believe, lately invented by some great Parisian gastronomer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed;  and where did you make his acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  same crimson hue that had mounted to Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s forehead when the Frenchman&rsquo;s  card was handed to him, dyed his face now, and he hesitated for a few moments before  replying to Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s straight question. But he recovered himself pretty  quickly, and answered with his accustomed carelessnes of manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  did I know him? Oh, in London,  of course. He was an inhabitant of that refuge for the destitute of all nations,  some years ago, while I was sowing my wild oats there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before  you went to India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course before I went to India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton looked sharply at the young man&rsquo;s face. There were moments when the lawyer&rsquo;s  prudence, when the conscientious scruples of an honest man got the better of the  husband&rsquo;s selfish fears; and in those moments Gilbert Monckton doubted whether he  was doing his duty towards his ward in suffering her to marry Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>Was  the young man worthy of the trust that was to be confided to him? Was he a fitting  husband for an inexperienced and frivolous girl?</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton could only answer this question in one way. He could only satisfy his conscience  by taking a cynical view of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot  Darrell is as good as other young men, I dare say,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good-looking,  and conceited, and shallow, and idle; but the poor little girl has chosen to fall  in love with him, and if I come between them, and forbid this marriage, and make  the silly child unhappy by forcing my choice upon her, I may be quite as much mistaken  as she, and after all marry her to a bad man. I may just as well let her draw her  own number in the great lottery, and trust to Providence for its being a lucky one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  to-night there was something in Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s manner which aroused a vague  suspicion in the breast of the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  your friend, the <em>commis voyageur</em>, has gone back to Windsor, I suppose?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  I couldn&rsquo;t very well avoid giving him a shelter, as he chose to come, though he  came uninvited. I sent him back to Hazlewood with a few lines addressed to my mother,  who will do her best to make him comfortable, I dare say. Poor soul, she would scarcely  refuse to shelter a stray dog, if the wandering cur were in any way attached to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Darrell, you have reason to value your mother&rsquo;s affection,&rdquo; answered the lawyer,  gravely. &ldquo;But we must not forget that we&rsquo;ve a good deal of business to transact  to-night. Will you come with me into my study, as soon as you&rsquo;ve finished that cup  of tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell bowed, and set down his teacup on the nearest table. Eleanor and Richard  had both watched him closely since his coming into the drawing-room. It was easy  to see that he had by no means recovered from the unpleasant surprise caused him  by the Frenchman&rsquo;s visit. His careless manner was only assumed, and it was with  evident difficulty that he responded to each new demand made upon his attention.</p>
<p>He followed  Gilbert Monckton slowly and silently from the room, without having lingered to speak  so much as a word to Laura, without having even made her happy by so much as a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  might have spoken to me,&rdquo; the young lady murmured, disconsolately, as she watched  her lover&rsquo;s retreating figure.</p>
<p>Two  hours elapsed before the gentlemen returned to the drawing-room; two dreary hours  for Laura, who sat yawning over a book, or playing with one of her dogs, which,  by virtue of their high-breeding and good conduct, were constant occupants of the  drawing-room at Tolldale. Richard Thornton and Mrs. Monckton played a game of chess,  the strangest game, perhaps, that ever was played, for the moving backwards and  forwards of the ivory pieces was a mere pretence, by means of which Eleanor contrived  to take counsel with her faithful ally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you think this man&rsquo;s coming will help us, Dick?&rdquo; she asked, when she had told the  story of her recognition of the Frenchman.</p>
<p>Richard  shook his head, not negatively, but reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  can I tell?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the man may or may not be inclined to betray his friend.  In any case it will be very difficult for us to get at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  for <em>you</em>, Richard,&rdquo; murmured Eleanor, persuasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  for <em>me</em>,&rdquo; echoed the young man. &ldquo;Syren, mermaiden, witch of the sea, avaunt!  It was you and the blue bonnet that settled for the shipbroker and his clerks. Have  you the blue bonnet still, Nell; or have you any other influence in the millinery  line that you can bring to bear upon this traveller in mustard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  if he should remember me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  scarcely likely. His face was impressed upon your mind by the awful circumstance  that followed your meeting with him. You have changed very much since you were fifteen  years of age, Mrs. Monckton. You were a feminine hobbledehoy then. Now you are&mdash;never  mind what. A superb Nemesis in crinoline, bent on deeds of darkness and horror.  No, I do not see any reason to fear this man&rsquo;s recognition of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  expression of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s face had subsided into a settled gloom when he  reappeared in the drawing-room with Mr. Monckton.</p>
<p>The  lawyer seated himself at a reading-table, and began to open the evening papers which  were sent from Windsor  to Tolldale. Launcelot strolled over to Laura Mason, and, sitting down beside her,  amused himself by pulling the silky ears of the Skye terrier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  tell me everything, Launcelot,&rdquo; said Miss Mason. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much I&rsquo;ve suffered  all this evening. I hope the interview was a pleasant one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, remarkably pleasant,&rdquo; answered the young man, with a sneer. &ldquo;I shall not be  exposed to the reproach of having made a mercenary marriage, Laura, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Launcelot?&rdquo; cried the young lady, staring aghast at her lover. &ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t mean that my guardian&rsquo;s been deceiving me all this time, and that I&rsquo;m a poor  penniless creature after all, and that I ought to have been a companion, or a nursery  governess, or something of that kind, as Eleanor was before her marriage. You don&rsquo;t  mean that, Launcelot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  precisely,&rdquo; answered Mr. Darrell; &ldquo;but I mean that the noble allowance of which  your guardian has talked so much is to be two hundred a-year; which, as we are so  unfortunate as to possess the habits of a gentleman and a lady, will not go very  far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  ain&rsquo;t I rich,&mdash;ain&rsquo;t I an heiress?&rdquo; cried Miss Mason. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I what-you-may-call-&rsquo;ems&mdash;expectations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. I believe there is some vague promise of future wealth held out as a compensation  for all present deprivations. But really, although your guardian took great pains  to explain the dry business details to me, I was almost too tired to listen to him;  and certainly too stupid to understand very clearly what he meant. I believe there  is some money which you are to have by-and-by, upon the death of somebody. But as  it seems that the somebody is a person in the prime of life, who has the power of  altering his will at any moment that he may take it into his head to do so, I look  upon that expectation as rather a remote contingency. No, Laura, we must look our  position straight in the face. A life of hard work lies before me; a life of poverty  before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason made a wry face. Her mind had little power to realise anything but extremes.  Her idea of poverty was something very horrible. An existence of beggary, with the  chance of being called upon to do plain needlework for her daily bread, and with  the workhouse at the end of the prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I shall love you all the same, Launcelot,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;however poor we may be,  and I&rsquo;ll wear dresses without any trimming, and imitation lace. I suppose <em>you</em> wouldn&rsquo;t know imitation lace from real Valenciennes,  Launcelot, and it&rsquo;s so cheap. And I&rsquo;ll try and make pies and puddings, and I&rsquo;ll  learn to be economical, and I&rsquo;ve lots of jewellery that my guardian has given me,  and we can sell that if you like. I&rsquo;ll work as hard as that poor woman in the poem,  Launcelot, for your sake. &lsquo;Stitch, stitch, stitch, band and gusset, and seam.&rsquo; I  don&rsquo;t mind the seams, dear; <em>they&rsquo;d</em> be easy if one didn&rsquo;t prick one&rsquo;s fingers  and make knots in one&rsquo;s thread; but I&rsquo;m afraid I shall never be able to manage the  gussets. Only promise me that you&rsquo;ll love me still, Launcelot. Tell me that you  don&rsquo;t hate me because I&rsquo;m poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man took the soft little hand that was laid with an imploring gesture on his  wrist, and pressed it tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should  be a brute if I wasn&rsquo;t grateful for your love, Laura,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wish <em>you</em> to be a rich woman. I&rsquo;m not the sort of fellow who could contentedly accept a degraded  position, and sponge upon a wife&rsquo;s fortune. I only wanted&mdash;I only wanted <em>my own</em>,&rdquo;  he muttered with a savage accent; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m set upon and hemmed in on every side, and  I&rsquo;ve a hundred mortifications and miseries to bear for want of money. But I&rsquo;ll try  and make you a good husband, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will, Launcelot,&rdquo; cried the girl, melted by some touch of real earnestness in her  lover&rsquo;s tone that was new and welcome to her. &ldquo;How good it is of you to say that.  But how should you be otherwise than good; and you will be a great painter, and  all the world will admire you and talk about you, and we shall be so happy,&mdash;shan&rsquo;t  we, Launcelot?&mdash;wandering through Italy together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man answered her with a bitter laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Laura,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the sooner we get to Italy the better. Heaven knows, I&rsquo;ve  no particular interest that need keep me in England, now.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter38"></a>Chapter 38<br>
  Mr. Monckton Brings Gloomy Tidings From Woodlands</strong></h2>
<p>For some few days after the Frenchman&rsquo;s arrival, Launcelot Darrell stopped  away from the Priory, much to the regret of his betrothed, whose delight in her <em>trousseau</em> was not sufficient to fill the blank made by her lover&rsquo;s absence.  Miss Mason roamed diconsolately about the house, looking out at the bare trees,  and the desolate garden walks, and quoted Tennyson until she became obnoxious to  her fellow-creatures by reason of her regret that he did not come, and her anxiety  that the day should be done, and other lamentations to the same effect.</p>
<p>She  ran out of doors sometimes under the bleak February sky, with a cambric handkerchief  over her head, as a sensible protection from the bitter atmosphere, and her light  ringlets flying in the wind, to stand at a little doorway in the high garden wall,  and watch for her lover&rsquo;s coming by a narrow pathway through the wood, which it  was his wont to make a short cut for himself in dry weather.</p>
<p>She  was standing in this narrow doorway upon the afternoon of the 22nd of February&mdash;only  twenty-one days before that eventful morning which was to make her Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  wife&mdash;with Eleanor Monckton by her side. The short winter&rsquo;s day was closing in, there  at least in the low woodland, whatever light might linger on the hill-tops above  Tolldale. The two women were silent: Eleanor was in very low spirits, for on this  day she had lost her friend and counsellor, Richard Thornton, who had had no alternative  but to leave Tolldale, or to forfeit a very remunerative and advantageous engagement  at one of the Edinburgh theatres, whither he had been summoned to paint the scenery  for a grand Easter burlesque, about to be produced with unusual splendour, by a  speculative Scottish manager; and who had, therefore, departed, taking his aunt  with him. George Vane&rsquo;s daughter felt terribly helpless in the absence of this faithful  ally. Richard had promised to attend to her summons, and to return to Tolldale at  any hour, if she should have need of his services, but he was separated from her  by a long distance, and how could she tell when the moment of that need might come.  She was alone, amongst people who had no sympathy with the purpose of her life,  and she bitterly felt the desolation of her position.</p>
<p>It was  no very great wonder, then, if she was thoughtful and silent, and by no means the  joyous, light-hearted companion whom Laura Mason had loved and clung to at Hazlewood,  before the coming of Launcelot Darrell. This young lady watched her now, furtively,  almost fearfully, wondering at the change in her, and speculating as to the cause  of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <em>must</em> have been in love with Launcelot,&rdquo; Laura thought; &ldquo;how could she help  being in love with him? And she married my guardian because he&rsquo;s rich, and now she&rsquo;s  sorry for having done so. And she&rsquo;s unhappy because I&rsquo;m going to be married to Launcelot.  And, oh! suppose Launcelot should still be in love with her; like the hero of a  dreadful French novel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  dusky shadows were gathering thickly in the wood, when two figures emerged from  the narrow pathway. A tall, slenderly-built young man, who switched the low brushwood  and the fern with his light cane as he walked along, and a puffy little individual  with a curly brimmed hat, who trotted briskly by his side.</p>
<p>Laura  was not slow to recognise her lover even in that dusky light, and Eleanor knew that  the young man&rsquo;s companion was the French commercial traveller.</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell introduced his friend to the two ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur  Victor Bourdon, Mrs. Monckton, Miss Mason,&rdquo; he muttered hastily; &ldquo;I daresay you  have thought me very neglectful, Laura,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;but I have been driving Monsieur  Bourdon about the neighbourhood for the last day or two. He&rsquo;s a stranger in this  part of the country, though he&rsquo;s almost as much an Englishman as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur  Bourdon laughed as he acknowledged the compliment with an air that was evidently  intended to be fascinating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-a-a-se,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;we have been to Vindsor. It is very naice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell frowned, and looked angrily at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Bourdon wanted to have a look at the state apartments,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he wanted to compare  them with those interminable galleries at Versailles,  I suppose, to the disparagement of our national glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the apartments are closed,&rdquo; said Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  of course,&rdquo; answered Mr. Darrell, looking at her rather suspiciously, &ldquo;they always  are closed when you happen to want to see them. Just like everything else in this  world of anomalies and paradoxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  has taken his friend to Windsor,&rdquo;  Eleanor thought; &ldquo;had this visit any relation to his last visit? Did he go there  to see Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s clerk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  was helpless without Richard, and could not answer this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  write to him to-night,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and ask him to come back to me directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  in the next moment she was ashamed of herself for her selfishness. She might sacrifice  her own life to her scheme of vengeance. The voice of her father crying to her from  his unsanctified grave, seemed for ever urging her to do that; but she had no right  to call upon others to make the same sacrifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she thought, &ldquo;wherever the road I have chosen may lead me, however difficult the  path may be to follow, I will henceforward tread it alone. Poor Dick! I have tormented  him long enough with my sorrows and my helplessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  come to dine, of course, Launcelot,&rdquo; Miss Mason said, while Eleanor stood motionless  and silent in the doorway, absorbed in these thoughts, and looking like some pale  statue in the dusk; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve brought your friend, Monsieur&mdash;Monsieur Bourdon to  dine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  but no, mademoiselle,&rdquo; exclaimed the Frenchman, in a transport of humility, &ldquo;I am  not one of yours. Monsieur Darrell is so good as to call me his friend, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Frenchman murmured something of a deprecatory nature, to the effect that he was  only a humble commercial traveller in the interests of a patent article that was  very much appreciated by all the crowned heads of Europe, and one which would doubtless,  by the aid of his exertions and those of his compatriots, become, before long, a  cosmopolitan necessity, and the source of a colossal fortune.</p>
<p>Eleanor  shuddered and shrank away from the man with a gesture almost expressive of disgust,  as he turned to her in his voluble depreciation of himself and glorification of  the merchandise which it was his duty to praise.</p>
<p>She  remembered that it was this man, this loquacious vulgarian, who had been Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s tool on the night of her father&rsquo;s death. This was the wretch who had stood  behind George Vane&rsquo;s chair, and watched the old man&rsquo;s play, and telegraphed to his  accomplice.</p>
<p>If she  could have forgotten Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s treachery, this presence would have been  enough to remind her of that pitiless baseness, to inspire her with a tenfold disgust  for that hideous cruelty. It seemed as if the Frenchman&rsquo;s coming had been designed  by Providence to  urge her to new energy, new determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  man who could make this creature his accomplice in a plot against my father shall  never inherit Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;he shall never marry  my husband&rsquo;s ward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  linked her arm in Laura&rsquo;s as she thought this; as if by that simple and involuntary  action she would have shielded her from Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>In the  next moment a footstep&mdash;the firm tread of a man&mdash;sounded on the crisp gravel of the  garden walk behind the two girls, and presently Gilbert Monckton laid his hand lightly  upon his wife&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>She  was startled by his unexpected coming, and turning suddenly round, looked at him  with a scared face; which was a new evidence against her in his troubled mind, a  new testimony that she was keeping some secret from him.</p>
<p>He had  left Tolldale Priory early that morning to give a day&rsquo;s attention to that business  of which he had been lately so neglectful, and had returned a couple of hours before  his usual time for coming home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  brings you out into the garden this bitter afternoon, Eleanor?&rdquo; he said, sternly;  &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll catch cold in that thin shawl; and you, too, Laura; I should have thought  a seat by the drawing-room fire far more comfortable than this dreary garden. Good  evening, gentlemen; you had better bring your friend into the house, Mr. Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man muttered something of an apologetic nature, and Monsieur Victor Bourdon  acknowledged the lawyer&rsquo;s cold salutation with an infinite number of bows and smirks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have come home by an earlier train than usual, Gilbert,&rdquo; Mrs. Monckton said, by  way of saying something that might break the silence which had followed her husband&rsquo;s  coming; &ldquo;we did not expect you until seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came  to Windsor by the  three o&rsquo;clock express,&rdquo; answered Mr. Monckton. &ldquo;I have not come straight home. I  stopped at Woodlands to inquire after the invalid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked up with a new and eager expression in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  Mr. de Crespigny&mdash;he is better, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Eleanor, I fear that you will never see him again. The doctors scarcely hope that  he will last out the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  girl set her lips firmly, and raised her head with a resolute gesture&mdash;a mute expression  of determination and defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>will</em> see him again,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I will not trust my hope of vengeance to a chance.  He may have altered his will, perhaps. He may have destroyed it. Come what may,  I will stand beside his sick bed. I will tell him who I am, and call upon him, in  my dead father&rsquo;s name, to do an act of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell stood with his head bent and his eyes fixed upon the ground.</p>
<p>As it  was the habit of Eleanor to lift her forehead with something of the air of a young  war-horse who scents the breath of the battle-field afar, so it was this young man&rsquo;s  manner to look moodily earthward under the influence of any violent agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo;  he said, slowly, &ldquo;the old man is dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Monckton; &ldquo;your great-uncle is dying. You may be master of Woodlands,  Launcelot, before many days are past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he muttered; &ldquo;I may: <em>I may</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter39"></a>Chapter 39<br>
  Launcelot&rsquo;s Counsellor</strong></h2>
<p>Mr. Darrell, and his friend the commercial traveller, did not linger  long at the garden gate. There was nothing very cordial or conciliatory in Gilbert  Monckton&rsquo;s manner, and he had evidently no wish to cultivate any intimate relations  with Monsieur Victor Bourdon.</p>
<p>Nor  was Launcelot Darrell by any means anxious that his companion should be invited  to stop at Tolldale. He had brought the Frenchman to the Priory, but he had only  done so because Monsieur Bourdon was one of those pertinacious gentlemen not easily  to be shaken off by the victims who are so unfortunate as to have fallen into their  power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said the artist, as the two men walked away from the Priory in the murky dusk, &ldquo;what  do you think of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  which <em>her?</em> <em>La belle future</em>, or the otha-i-r?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you think of Mrs. Monckton? I don&rsquo;t want your opinion of my future wife, thank  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur  Bourdon looked at his companion with a smile that was half a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is so proud, this dear Monsieur Lan&mdash;Darrell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You ask of me what I think  of Mrs. Monck-a-tonne,&rdquo; he continued in English; &ldquo;shall I tell you what I think  without reserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  then that she is a woman of a thousand&mdash;in all that there is of resolute&mdash;in all that  there is of impulsive&mdash;in all that there is of daring&mdash;a woman unapproachable, unsurpassable;  beautiful to damn the angels! If in the little business that we came to talk about  lately, this woman is to be in the way; I say to you, my friend, beware! If there  is to be any contest between you and her, beware!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray  don&rsquo;t go into heroics, Bourdon,&rdquo; answered Launcelot Darrell, with evident displeasure.  Vanity was one of the artist&rsquo;s strongest vices; and he writhed at the notion of  being considered inferior to any one, above all, to a woman. &ldquo;I knew Mrs. Monckton,  and I knew that she was a clever, high-spirited girl, before to-day. I don&rsquo;t want  you to tell me that. As to any contest between her and me, there&rsquo;s no chance of  that arising. <em>She</em> doesn&rsquo;t stand in my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you refuse to tell your devoted friend the name of the person who does stand in  your way?&rdquo; murmured Monsieur Bourdon, in his most insinuating tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  that information cannot be of the least consequence to my devoted friend,&rdquo; answered  Launcelot Darrell, coolly. &ldquo;If my devoted friend has helped me, he will expect to  be paid for his help, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  certainly!&rdquo; cried the Frenchman, with an air of candour; &ldquo;you will recompense me  for my services if we are successful; and above all for the suggestion which first  put into your head the idea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  suggestion which prompted me to the commission of a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,  my friend, even the trees in this wood may have ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Bourdon,&rdquo; continued Launcelot, bitterly, &ldquo;I have good reason to thank you, and to  reward you. From the hour in which we first met until now, you have contrived to  do me some noble services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur  Bourdon laughed a dry, mocking laugh, which had something of the diabolically grotesque  in its sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  what a noble creation of the poet&rsquo;s mind is Faust!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;that excellent,  that amiable hero; who would never, of his own will, do any harm; but who is always  led into the commission of all manner of wickedness by Mephistopheles. And then,  when this noble but unhappy man is steeped to the very lips in sin, he can turn  upon that wicked counsellor and say, &lsquo;Demon, it is for your pleasure these crimes  have been committed!&rsquo; Of course he forgets, this impulsive Faust, that it was he,  and not Mephistopheles, who was in love with poor Gretchen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be a fool, Bourdon,&rdquo; muttered the artist, impatiently. &ldquo;You know what I mean. When  I started in life I was too proud to commit a dishonourable action. It is you, and  such as you, who have made me what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  exclaimed the Frenchman, snapping his fingers with a gesture of unutterable contempt.  &ldquo;You asked me just now to spare you my heroics; I say the same thing now to you.  Do not let us talk to each other like the personages of a drama at the Ambigu. It  is your necessities that have made you what you are, and that will keep you what  you are so long as they exist and are strong enough to push you to disagreeable  courses. Who says it is pleasant to go out of the straight line? Not I, Monsieur  Lance! Believe me, it is more pleasant, as well as more proper, to be virtuous than  to be wicked. Give me an annuity of a few thousand francs, and I will be the most  honourable of men. You are afraid of the work that lies before you, because it is  difficult, because it is dangerous; but not because it is dishonourable. Let us  speak frankly, and call things by their right names. You want to inherit this old  man&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Launcelot Darrell. &ldquo;I have been taught from my babyhood to expect it. I  have a right to expect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely;  and you don&rsquo;t want this other person, whose name you won&rsquo;t tell me, to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, then. Do not let us have any further dispute about the matter. Do not abuse  poor Mephistopheles because he has shown the desire to help you to gain your own  ends; and has already by decision and promptitude of action achieved that which  you would never have effected by yourself alone. Tell Mephistopheles to go about  his business, and he will go. But he will not stay to be made a&mdash;what you call&mdash;an  animal which is turn out into the wilderness with other people&rsquo;s sins upon his shoulders?&mdash;a  scape-goat; or a paws-cat, which pull hot chestnuts from the fire, and burn her  fingers in the interests of her friend. The chestnuts, in this case, here, are <em>very</em> hot, my friend; but I risk to burn my fingers with the shells in the hope to partake  the inside of the nut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never  meant to make a scapegoat of you, nor a cat&rsquo;s-paw,&rdquo; said Launcelot Darrell, with  some alarm in his tone. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you, Bourdon. You&rsquo;re a very good  fellow in your way, I know; and, if your notions are a little loose upon some subjects,  why, as you say, a man&rsquo;s necessities are apt to get the upper hand of his principles.  If Maurice de Crespigny has chosen to make an iniquitous will, to the ruin of his  rightful heir, and for the mere gratification of an old madman&rsquo;s whim, the consequences  of his injustice must rest on his head, not on mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most  assuredly,&rdquo; cried the Frenchman, &ldquo;that argument is not to be answered. Be happy,  my friend, we will bring about a posthumous adjustment of the old man&rsquo;s errors.  The wrong done by this deluded testator shall be repaired before his ashes are carried  to their resting-place. Have no fear, my friend; all is prepared, as you know, and,  let the time come when it may, we are ready to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell gave a long sigh, a fretful, discontented inspiration, that was expressive  of utter weariness. This young man had in the course of his life committed many  questionable and dishonourable actions; but he had always done such wrong as it  were under protest, and with the air of a victim, who is innocently disposed, but  too easily persuaded, and who reluctantly suffers himself to be led away by the  counsels of evil-minded wretches.</p>
<p>So now  he had the air of yielding to the subtle arguments of his friend, the agent for  patent mustard.</p>
<p>The  two men walked on in silence for some little time. They had left the wood long ago,  and were in a broad lane that led towards Hazlewood. Launcelot Darrell strolled  silently along with his head bent and his black eyebrows contracted. His companion&rsquo;s  manner had its usual dapper airiness; but every now and then the Frenchman&rsquo;s sharp  greenish blue eyes glanced from the pathway before him to the gloomy face of the  artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  is one thing that I forgot, in speaking of Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; Monsieur Bourdon said  presently; &ldquo;and that is that I fancy I have seen her somewhere before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can account for that,&rdquo; Launcelot Darrell answered carelessly. &ldquo;I was inclined  to think the same thing myself when I first saw her. She is like George Vane&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George  Vane&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the girl we saw on the Boulevard upon the night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man stopped abruptly, and gave another of those fretful sighs by which he  made a kind of sulky atonement for the errors of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do  not remember the daughter of George Vane,&rdquo; murmured the Frenchman, reflectively.  &ldquo;I know that there was a young girl with that wearisome old Englishman&mdash;a sort of  overgrown child, with bright yellow hair and big eyes; an overgrown child who was  not easily to be shaken off; but I remember no more. Yet I think I have seen this  Mrs. Monckton before to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I tell you Eleanor Monckton is like that girl. I saw the likeness when I first came  home, though I only caught one glimpse of the face of George Vane&rsquo;s daughter on  the Boulevard that night. And, if I had not had reason for thinking otherwise, I  should have been almost inclined to believe that the old schemer&rsquo;s daughter had  come to Hazlewood to plot against my interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do  not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  remember George Vane&rsquo;s talk about his friend&rsquo;s promise, and the fortune that he  was to inherit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  perfectly. We used to laugh at the poor hopeful old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  used to wonder why I took such an interest in the poor old fellow&rsquo;s talk. Heaven  knows I never wished him ill, much less meant him any harm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except  so far as getting hold of his money,&rdquo; murmured Monsieur Bourdon, in an undertone.</p>
<p>The  young man turned impatiently upon his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  do you delight in raking up unpleasant memories?&rdquo; he said in a half-savage, half-peevish  tone. &ldquo;George Vane was only one amongst many others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most  certainly! Amongst a great many others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  if I happened to play <em>&eacute;cart&eacute;</em> better than most of the men we knew&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  say nothing of that pretty little trick with an extra king in the lining of your  coat sleeve, which I taught you, my friend.&mdash;But about George Vane, about the friend  of George Vane, about the promise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George  Vane&rsquo;s friend is my great-uncle, Maurice de Crespigny; and the promise was made  when the two were young men at Oxford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the promise was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A romantic,  boyish business, worthy of the Minerva Press. If either of the two friends died  unmarried, he was to leave all his possessions to the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing  the other to survive him. But Monsieur de Crespigny cannot leave his money to the  dead. George Vane is dead. You need no longer fear him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I have no reason to fear <em>him!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  of whom then have you fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  you mind that, Bourdon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very clever fellow, and a very good-natured  fellow, when you please. But it&rsquo;s sometimes safest to keep one&rsquo;s own secrets. You  know what we talked about yesterday. Unless I take your advice I&rsquo;m a ruined man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you will take it? Having gone so far, and taken so much trouble, and confided so  much in strangers, you will surely not recede?&rdquo; said Monsieur Bourdon, in his most  insinuating tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  my great-uncle is dying, the crisis has come, and I must decide, one way or the  other,&rdquo; answered Launcelot Darrell, slowly, in a thick voice that was strange to  him. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;can&rsquo;t face ruin, Bourdon. I think I <em>must</em> take your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>knew</em> that you would take it, my friend,&rdquo; the commercial traveller returned, quietly.</p>
<p>The  two men turned out of the lane and climbed a rough stile leading into a meadow that  lay between them and Hazlewood. The lights burned brightly in the lower windows  of Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s house, and the clock of the village church slowly struck six as  Launcelot and his companion crossed the meadow.</p>
<p>A dark  figure was dimly visible, standing at a low wicket-gate that opened from the meadow  into the Hazlewood shrubbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  my mother,&rdquo; muttered Launcelot, &ldquo;watching for me at the gate. She&rsquo;s heard the news,  perhaps. Poor soul, if I didn&rsquo;t care about the fortune for my own sake, I should  for hers. I think a disappointment would almost kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again  a coward&rsquo;s argument,&mdash;a new loophole by means of which Launcelot Darrell tried to  creep out of the responsibility of his own act, and to make another, in a manner,  accountable for his sin.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter40"></a>Chapter 40<br>
  Resolved</strong></h2>
<p>Eleanor Monckton walked slowly back to the house, by the side of her husband,  whose eyes never left his wife&rsquo;s face during that short walk between the garden-gate  and the long French window by which the two girls had left the drawing-room. Even  in the dusk, Gilbert Monckton could see that his wife&rsquo;s face was unusually pale.</p>
<p>She  spoke to him as they entered the drawing-room, laying her hand upon his arm as she  addressed him, and looking earnestly at him in the red firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  Mr. de Crespigny really dying, Gilbert?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear  that, from what the medical men say, there is very little doubt about it. The old  man is going fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  paused for a few moments, with her head bent and her face hidden from her husband.</p>
<p>Then,  suddenly looking up, she spoke to him again; this time with intense earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gilbert,  I want to see Mr. de Crespigny before he dies; I want to see him alone&mdash;I must see  him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer stared at his wife in utter bewilderment. What in Heaven&rsquo;s name was the meaning  of this sudden energy, this intense eagerness, which blanched the colour in her  cheeks, and held her breathless? Her friendly feeling for the invalid, her womanly  pity for an old man&rsquo;s infirmities, could never have been powerful enough to cause  such emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  want to see Maurice de Crespigny, Eleanor?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Monckton, in a tone of  undisguised wonder. &ldquo;But why do you want to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  something to tell him&mdash;something that he <em>must</em> know before he dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer started. A sudden light broke in upon his bewildered mind,&mdash;a light that showed  him the woman he loved in very odious colours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  want to tell him who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  tell him who I am? yes!&rdquo; Eleanor answered absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  for what reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton was silent for a moment, looking thoughtfully at her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  reason is a secret, Gilbert,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I cannot even tell it to you&mdash;yet. But I  hope to do so very, very soon. Perhaps to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer bit his under lip, and walked away from his wife with a frown upon his face.  He left Eleanor standing before the fireplace, and took two or three turns up and  down the room, pacing backwards and forwards in moody silence.</p>
<p>Then,  suddenly returning to her, he said, with an air of angry resolution that chilled  her timid confidence in him, and cast her back upon herself, &ldquo;Eleanor, there is  something in all this that wounds me to the very quick. There is a mystery between  us; a mystery that has lasted too long. Why did you stipulate that your maiden name  should be kept a secret from Maurice de Crespigny? Why have you paid him court ever  since your coming to this place? And why, now that you hear of his approaching death,  do you want to force yourself into his presence? Eleanor, Eleanor, there can be  but one reason for all this, and that the most sordid, the most miserable and mercenary  of reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George  Vane&rsquo;s daughter looked at her husband with a stare of blank dismay, as if she was  trying, but trying in vain, to attach some meaning to his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sordid  reason&mdash;a mercenary reason,&rdquo; she repeated slowly, in a half whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Eleanor,&rdquo; answered Gilbert Monckton, passionately. &ldquo;Why should you be different  from the rest of the world? It has been my error, my mad delusion to think you so;  as I once thought another woman who deceived me as God forbid you should ever deceive  me. It has been my folly to trust and believe in you, forgetful of the past, false  to the teaching of most bitter experience. I have been mistaken&mdash;once more&mdash;all the  more egregiously, perhaps, because this time I thought I was so deliberate, so cautious.  You are <em>not</em> different to the rest of the world. If other women are mercenary,  you too are mercenary. You were not content with having sacrificed your inclination  for the sake of making what the world calls an advantageous marriage. You were not  satisfied with having won a wealthy husband, and you sought to inherit Maurice de  Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton passed both her hands across her forehead, pushing back the loose masses  of her hair, as if she would by that movement have cleared away some of the clouds  that overshadowed her brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> seek to inherit Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!  Your father no doubt educated you in that idea. I have heard how obstinately he  built upon the inheritance of his friend&rsquo;s wealth. He taught you to share his hopes:  he bequeathed them to you as the only legacy he had to give&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  cried Eleanor, suddenly; &ldquo;the inheritance I received at my father&rsquo;s death was no  inheritance of hope. Do not say any more to me, Mr. Monckton. It seems as if my  brain had no power to bear all this to-night. If you can think these base things  of me, I must be content to endure your bad opinion. I know that I have been very  forgetful of you, very neglectful of you, since I have been your wife, and you have  reason to think badly of me. But my mind has been so full of other things; so full,  that it has seemed to me as if all else in life&mdash;except those thoughts, that one  hope&mdash;slipped by me like the events of a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton looked half-fearfully at his wife as she spoke. There was something in  her manner that he had never seen before. He had seen her only when her feelings  had been held in check by her utmost power of repression. That power was beginning  to wear out now. The strain upon Eleanor&rsquo;s intellect had been too great, and her  nerves were losing their power of tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  not say anything more to me,&rdquo; she cried, imploringly; &ldquo;do not say anything more.  It will soon be over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  will soon be over, Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Eleanor did not answer. She clasped her hands before her face; a half-stifled sob  broke from her lips, and she rushed from the room before her husband could repeat  his question.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton looked after her with an expression of unmingled anguish on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  can I doubt the truth?&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;her indignant repudiation of any design on  Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune exonerates her at least from that charge. But her  agitation, her tears, her confusion, all betray the truth. Her heart has never been  mine. She married me with the determination to do her duty to me, and to be true  to me. I believe that. Yes, in spite of all, I will believe that. But her love is  Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s. Her love, the one blessing I sought to win,&mdash;the blessing which  in my mad folly I was weak enough to hope for,&mdash;is given to Laura&rsquo;s betrothed husband.  What could be plainer than the meaning of those last broken words she spoke just  now: &lsquo;It will soon be over; it will soon be over&rsquo;? What should she mean except that  Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s marriage and departure will put an end to the struggle of her  life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mingled  with the bitterness of his grief, some feeling akin to pity had a place in Gilbert  Monckton&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>He pitied  her&mdash;yes, he pitied this girl whose life it had been his fate to overshadow. He had  come between this bright young creature and the affection of her innocent girlhood,  and, presenting himself before her in the hour of her desolation, had betrayed her  into one of those mistakes which a life-time of honest devotion is not always able  to repair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  consented to marry me on the impulse of the moment, clinging to me in her loneliness  and helplessness, and blinded to the future by the sorrow of the present. It was  an instinct of confidence and not love that drew her towards me; and now, now that  there is no retreat&mdash;no drawing back&mdash;nothing but a long vista of dreary years to  be spent with a man she does not love, this poor unhappy girl suffers an agony which  can no longer be concealed, even from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton paced up and down his spacious drawing-room, thinking of these things.  Once he looked with a sad, bitter smile at the evidences of wealth that were so  lavishly scattered about the handsome chamber. On every side those evidences met  his eyes. The Guido, upon which the firelight gleamed, kindling the face of a martyr  into supernatural glory, was worth a sum that would have been a fortune to a poor  man. Every here and there, half hidden amongst the larger modern pictures, lurked  some tiny gem of Italian art, a few square inches of painted canvas worth full a  hundred times its weight of unalloyed gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  my wife were as frivolous as Laura,&rdquo; thought Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;I could make her happy,  perhaps. Fine dresses, and jewels, and pictures, and furniture, would be enough  to make happiness for an empty-headed woman. If Eleanor had been influenced by mercenary  feelings when she married me she would have surely made more use of my wealth; she  would have paraded the jewellery I have given her, and made herself a lay figure  for the display of milliner&rsquo;s work; at least while the novelty of her position lasted.  But she has dressed as plainly as a village tradesman&rsquo;s wife, and the only money  she has spent is that which she has given to her friend the music-mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  second dinner-bell rang while Gilbert Monckton was pacing the empty drawing-room,  and he went straight to the dining-room in his frock-coat, and with no very great  appetite for the dishes that were to be set before him.</p>
<p>Eleanor  took her place at the top of the table. She wore a brown silk dress, a few shades  darker than her auburn hair, and her white shoulders gleamed like ivory against  bronze. She had bathed her head and face with cold water, and her rippling hair  was still wet. She was very pale, very grave; but all traces of violent emotion  had passed away, and there was a look of quiet determination about her mouth.</p>
<p>Laura  Mason came rustling and fluttering into the room, as Mr. and Mrs. Monckton took  their places at the dinner-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  my Pink,&rdquo;  said the young lady, alluding to a very elaborate toilette of blush-rose coloured  silk, bedizened with innumerable yards of lace and ribbon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought  you would like to see my pink, and I want to know how it looks. It&rsquo;s the new pink.  Launcelot says the new pink is like strawberry-ices, but I like it. It&rsquo;s one of  the dinner dresses in my trousseau, you know,&rdquo; she murmured, apologetically, to  Mr. Monckton; &ldquo;and I wanted to try the effect of it, though of course it&rsquo;s only  to be worn at a party. The trimmings on the cross sit beautifully; don&rsquo;t they, Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  fortunate, perhaps, on this occasion at least, that Miss Mason possessed the faculty  of keeping up a kind of conversational monologue, for otherwise there must have  been a very dreary silence at the dinner-table upon this particular evening.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton never spoke except when the business of the meal compelled him to do so.  But there was a certain tenderness of tone in the very few words he had occasion  to address to his wife which was utterly different to his manner before dinner.  It was never Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s habit to sit long over the dismal expanse of a dessert-table;  but to-night, when the cloth had been removed and the two women left the room, he  followed them without any delay whatever.</p>
<p>Eleanor  seated herself in a low chair by the fire-place. She had looked at her watch twice  during dinner, and now her eyes wandered almost involuntarily to the dial of the  clock upon the chimney-piece.</p>
<p>Her  husband crossed the room and leant for a few moments over her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  sorry for what I said this afternoon, Eleanor,&rdquo; he murmured in a low voice; &ldquo;can  you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  wife lifted her eyes to his face. Those luminous grey eyes had a look of mournful  sweetness in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive  you!&rdquo; exclaimed Eleanor, &ldquo;it is you who have so much to forgive. But I will atone&mdash;I  will atone&mdash;after to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  said these last words almost in a whisper, rather as if she had been speaking to  herself than to her husband; but Gilbert Monckton heard those whispered syllables,  and drew his own conclusions from them. Unhappily every word that Mrs. Monckton  uttered tended to confirm her husband&rsquo;s doubts and to increase his wretchedness.</p>
<p>He seated  himself in a reading-chair upon the opposite side of the hearth, and, drawing a  lamp close to his elbow, buried himself, or appeared to bury himself, in his newspapers.</p>
<p>But  every now and then the upper margin of the &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Post,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rdquo;  or the &ldquo;Saturday,&rdquo; or whatever journal the lawyer happened to be perusing&mdash;and he  took up one after the other with a fretful restlessness that betokened a mind ill  at ease&mdash;dropped a little lower than the level of the reader&rsquo;s eyes, and Mr. Monckton  looked across the edge of the paper at his wife.</p>
<p>Almost  every time he did so he found that Eleanor&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon the clock.</p>
<p>The  discovery of this fact speedily became a torture to him. He followed his wife&rsquo;s  eyes to the slowly moving hands upon the enameled dial. He watched the minute-hand  as it glided from one figure to another, marking intervals of five minutes that  seemed like five hours. Even when he tried to read, the loud ticking of the wretched  time-piece came between him and the sense of the page upon which his eyes were fixed,  and the monotonous sound seemed to deafen and bewilder him.</p>
<p>Eleanor  sat quite still in her low easy-chair. Scraps of fancy-work and open books lay upon  the table beside her, but she made no effort to beguile the evening by any feminine  occupation. Laura Mason, restless for want of employment and companionship, fluttered  about the room like some discontented butterfly, stopping every now and then before  a looking-glass, to contemplate some newly discovered effect in the elegant costume  which she called her &ldquo;pink;&rdquo; but Eleanor took no notice whatever of her murmured  exclamations and appeals for sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know what&rsquo;s come to you, Nelly, since your marriage,&rdquo; the young lady cried at last;  after vainly trying to draw Mrs. Monckton&rsquo;s attention to the manifold beauties of  gauze puffings and floating streamers of ribbon; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem to take any interest  in life. You&rsquo;re quite a different girl to what you were at Hazlewood&mdash;before Launcelot  came home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton threw down the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rdquo; and took up &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; at this juncture. He stared  with a stony face at one of Mr. Leech&rsquo;s most genial cartoons, and glanced almost  vengefully at the familiar double columns of jokes. Eleanor looked away from the  clock to answer her companion&rsquo;s peevish compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  thinking of Mr. de Crespigny,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he may be dying while we are sitting here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton dropped &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; and looked, openly this time, at his wife&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Could  it be, after all, that her abstraction of manner really arose from no deeper cause  than her regret for the loss of this old man, who was her dead father&rsquo;s friend,  and who had displayed an especial affection for her?</p>
<p>Could  it be so? No! Her words that night had revealed more than a common sorrow such as  this. They had betrayed the secret of a hidden struggle&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s grief&mdash;not easily  to be repressed or overcome. There is no knowing how long the lawyer might have  sat brooding over his troubles under cover of the newspapers, but presently he remembered  some papers which he had brought from London that afternoon, and which it was his  imperative duty&mdash;in the interests of a very important client&mdash;to read that night.</p>
<p>He pushed  away the lamp, rose from his low chair, and went to the door of the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  going to my study, Eleanor,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I shall most likely spend the rest of the  evening there, and I may be obliged to be very late. You won&rsquo;t sit up for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no; not unless you wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On  no account. Good-night. Good-night, Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even  while his wife wished him good-night, her eyes wandered uneasily back to the clock.  A quarter to ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  he hasn&rsquo;t once looked at my pink!&rdquo; murmured Miss Mason, as her guardian left the  drawing-room.</p>
<p>Scarcely  had the door closed when Eleanor Monckton rose from her chair.</p>
<p>Her  flushed cheeks flamed with crimson brightness; her eyes were lighted up as if a  fire had burned in their dilated pupils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  going to bed, Laura,&rdquo; she said abruptly; &ldquo;I am very tired. Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  took a candle from a table near the door, lit it, and hurried from the room before  Laura could question her or remonstrate with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t <em>look</em> tired,&rdquo; thought Miss Mason; &ldquo;she looks as if she were going  to a ball; or going to have the scarlatina. I think I looked like that when I was  going to have the scarlatina; and when Launcelot proposed to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five  minutes after the stable-clock struck ten, the great door of Tolldale Priory was  opened by a cautious hand, and Mrs. Monckton stole out of her house with a woollen  cloak wrapped about her, and her head almost buried in the hood belonging to the  thick winter garment. She closed the door softly, and then, without stopping to  look behind her, hurried down the broad stone steps, across the courtyard, along  the gravelled garden pathway, out at the narrow wooden door in the wall, and away  into the dreary darkness of the wood that lay between the Priory grounds and the  dwelling-place of Maurice de Crespigny.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter41"></a>Chapter 41<br>
  A Terrible Surprise</strong></h2>
<p>With the chill winds of February blowing in her face, Eleanor  Monckton entered the wood between Tolldale and Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>There  were no stars in the blank grey sky above that lonely place; black masses of pine  and fir shut in the narrow path upon either side; mysterious noises, caused by the  capricious moaning of the winter wind, sounded far away in the dark recesses of  the wood, awfully distinct amid the stillness of the night.</p>
<p>It was  very long since Eleanor had been out alone after dark, and she had never before  been alone in the darkness of such a place as this. She had the courage of a young  lioness, but she had also a highly nervous and sensitive nature, an imaginative  temperament; and the solemn loneliness of this wood, resonant every now and then  with the dismal cries of the night-wind, was very terrible to her. But above and  beyond every natural womanly feeling was this girl&rsquo;s devotion to her dead father;  and she walked on with her thick shawl gathered closely round her, and with both  her hands pressed against her beating heart.</p>
<p>She  walked on through the solitude and the darkness, not indifferently, but devotedly;  in sublime self-abnegation; in the heroic grandeur of a soul that is elevated by  love; as she would have walked through fire and water, if by the endurance of such  an ordeal she could have given fresh proof of her affection for that hapless suicide  of the Faubourg Saint Antoine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear father,&rdquo; she murmured once, in a low voice, &ldquo;I have been slow to act, but I  have never forgotten. I have never forgotten you lying far away from me in that  cruel foreign grave. I have waited, but I will wait no longer. I will speak to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think  she believed that George Vane, divided from her by the awful chasm which yawns,  mysterious and unfathomable, betwixt life and death, was yet near enough akin to  her, in his changed state of being, to witness her actions and hear her words. She  spoke to him, as she would have written to him had he been very far away from her,  in the belief that her words would reach him, sooner or later.</p>
<p>The  walk, which in the daytime seemed only a pleasant ramble, was a weary pilgrimage  under the starless winter sky. Eleanor stopped once or twice to look back at the  lighted windows of Tolldale lying low in the hollow behind her; and then hurried  on with a quicker step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  Gilbert should miss me,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;what will he do? what will he think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  quickened her pace even more at the thought of her husband. What unlooked-for difficulties  might she not have to combat if Mr. Monckton should discover her absence and send  or go himself in search of her? But she speedily reassured herself upon this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  he should come to Woodlands after me,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I will tell him that I wanted  to see Mr. de Crespigny once more. I can easily tell him that, for it is the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton had reached the outskirts of the wood by this time, and the low gate in  the iron fence&mdash;the gateway through which she had passed upon the day when, for the  first time, she saw her father&rsquo;s old friend, Maurice de Crespigny.</p>
<p>This  gate was very rarely locked or bolted, but to-night, to her surprise, she found  it wide open.</p>
<p>She  did not stop to wonder at this circumstance, but hurried on. She had grown very  familiar with every pathway in the grounds in her walks beside Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s  invalid chair, and she knew the nearest way to the house.</p>
<p>This  nearest way was across a broad expanse of turf, and through a shrubbery into the  garden at the back of the rooms occupied by the old man, who had for many years  been unable to go up and down stairs, and who had, for that length of time, inhabited  a suite of rooms on the ground-floor, opening with French windows on to a tiny lawn,  shut in and sheltered by a thick belt of pine and evergreens. It was in this shrubbery  that Eleanor paused for a few moments to recover her breath after hurrying up the  hill, and to reassure herself as to the safety of the papers which she carried in  the bosom of her dress&mdash;Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s water-colour sketch, and her father&rsquo;s  letter. The picture and the letter were safe. She reassured herself of this, and  was about to hurry on, when she was arrested by a sound near her. The laurel branches  close beside her had rustled as if parted by a man&rsquo;s strong hand.</p>
<p>Many  times, in her journey through the wood, Eleanor had been terrified by a rustling  amongst the long grass about the trunks of the trees; but each time the sight of  a pheasant flying across her pathway, or a frightened hare scudding away into the  darkness, had reassured her. But this time there could be no mistake as to what  she had heard. There was no game in Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s garden. She was not alone,  therefore. There was a man lurking somewhere under the shadow of the evergreens.  She stopped; clutched the documents that she carried in her breast, and then emerged  from the shrubbery on to the lawn, ashamed of her fears.</p>
<p>The  man whose presence had alarmed her was, no doubt, one of the servants&mdash;the gardener,  most likely&mdash;and he would admit her to the house and save her any encounter with  the maiden sisters.</p>
<p>She  looked about the garden, but could see no one. Then, in a low voice, she called  to the man by name; but there was no answer.</p>
<p>Lights  were burned in Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s bed-room, but the windows of the room which the  old man called his study, and the windows of his dressing-room, a little apartment  between the bed-chamber and the study, were dark.</p>
<p>Eleanor  waited a few minutes in the garden, expecting to hear or see one of the servants  emerge from the shrubbery; but all was quiet, and she had no alternative except  to go round to the principal door of the house, and take her chance of being admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  certain that there was some one close to me,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It must have been Brooks,  the gardener; but how odd that he didn&rsquo;t hear me when I called to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  principal entrance to Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s house was by a pair of half-glass doors,  approached by a double flight of stone steps, either from the right or the left,  as might suit the visitor&rsquo;s convenience. It was a handsome entrance; and the plate  glass which formed the upper halves of the doors appeared a very slight barrier  between the visitor waiting on the broad stone platform without, and the interior  of the house. But, for all this, no portcullis of the Middle Ages, no sturdy postern  gate of massive oak studded by ponderous iron nails, was ever more impregnable to  the besieger than these transparent doors had been under the despotic sway of the  rich bachelor&rsquo;s maiden nieces. Despairing poor relations, standing hopeless and  desperate without those fatal doors, had been well-nigh tempted to smash the plate-glass,  and thus make their way into the citadel. But, as this would have scarcely been  a likely method by which to ingratiate themselves into the favour of a testy old  man, the glass remained undamaged; and the hapless kinsfolk of Maurice de Crespigny  were fain to keep at a distance, and hope&mdash;almost against hope&mdash;that he would get  tired of his maiden watchers, and revenge himself upon their officiousness by leaving  his money away from them.</p>
<p>It was  outside these glass doors that Eleanor Monckton stood to-night, with very different  feelings in her breast to those which were wont to animate the visitors who came  to Woodlands.</p>
<p>She  pulled the brass handle of the bell, which was stiff from little usage, and which,  after resisting her efforts for a long time, gave way at last with an angry spring  that shook the distant clapper with a noisy peal which seemed as if it would have  never ceased ringing sharply through the stillness.</p>
<p>But,  loud as this peal had been, it was not answered immediately, and Eleanor had time  to contemplate the prim furniture of the dimly-lighted hall, the umbrella-stand  and barometer, and some marine views of a warlike nature on the walls; pictures  in which a De Crespigny of Nelson&rsquo;s time distinguished himself unpleasantly by the  blowing up of some very ugly ships which exploded in blazes of yellow ochre and  vermilion, and the bombardment of some equally ugly fortresses in burnt sienna.</p>
<p>A butler,  or factotum,&mdash;for there was only one male servant in the house, and he was old and  unpleasant, and had been cherished by the Misses De Crespigny because of those very  qualifications, which were likely to stand in the way of his getting any important  legacy,&mdash;emerged at last from one of the passages at the back of the hall, and advanced,  with indignation and astonishment depicted on his grim features, to the doors before  which Eleanor waited, Heaven only knows how impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot  Darrell may have come here before me,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;he may be with his uncle now,  and may induce him to alter his will. He must be desperate enough to do anything,  if he really knows that he is disinherited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  butler opened one of the hall doors, a very little way, and suspiciously. He took  care to plant himself in the aperture in such a manner as would have compelled Eleanor  to walk through his body before she could enter the hall; and as the butler was  the very reverse of Mr. Pepper&rsquo;s ghost in consistency, Mrs. Monckton could only  parley with him in the faint hope of taking the citadel by capitulation. She did  not know that the citadel was already taken, and that an awful guest, to whom neither  closely guarded doors nor oaken posterns lined with stoutest iron formed obstacle  or hindrance, had entered that quiet mansion before her; she did not know this,  nor that the butler only kept her at bay out of the sheer force of habit, and perhaps  with a spiteful sense of pleasure in doing battle with would-be legatees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want  to see Mr. de Crespigny,&rdquo; Eleanor cried, eagerly; &ldquo;I want to see him very particularly,  if you please. I know that he will see me if you will be so good as to tell him  that I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  butler opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so a door opened, and Miss  Lavinia de Crespigny appeared. She was very pale, and carried a handkerchief in  her hand, which she put to her eyes every now and then; but the eyes were quite  dry, and she had not been weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  is that?&rdquo; she exclaimed, sharply. &ldquo;What is the matter, Parker? Why can&rsquo;t you tell  the person that we can see nobody to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  just a-goin&rsquo; to tell her so,&rdquo; the butler answered; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s Mrs. Monckton, and  she says she wants to see poor master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved  away from the door, as if his responsibility had ceased on the appearance of his  mistress, and Eleanor entered the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear Miss Lavinia,&rdquo; she cried, almost breathless in her eagerness, &ldquo;do let me see  your uncle. I know he will not refuse to see me. I am a favourite with him, you  know. Please let me see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Lavinia de Crespigny applied her hand kerchief to her dry eyes before she answered  Eleanor&rsquo;s eager entreaty. Then she said very slowly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  beloved uncle departed this life an hour ago. He breathed his last in my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  in mine,&rdquo; murmured Miss Sarah, who had followed her sister into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  I was a-standing by the bedside,&rdquo; observed the butler, with respectful firmness;  &ldquo;and the last words as my blessed master said before you come into the room, Miss  Lavinia, was these: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been a good servant, Parker, and you&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;re  not forgotten.&rsquo; Yes, Miss, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;re not forgotten, Parker,&rsquo; were his  last words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two ladies looked very sharply and rather suspiciously at Mr. Parker, as if they  were meditating the possibility of that gentleman having fabricated a will constituting  himself sole legatee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> did not hear my dear uncle mention you, Parker,&rdquo; Miss Sarah said, stiffly; &ldquo;but <em>we</em> shall not forget any one he wished to have remembered; you may be sure  of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton stood, silent and aghast, staring straight before her, paralysed, dumbfounded,  by the tidings she had just heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;  she murmured at last. &ldquo;Dead! dead!&mdash;before I could see him, before I could tell him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  paused, looking round her with a bewildered expression in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do  not know <em>why</em> you should be so eager to see my uncle,&rdquo; said Miss Lavinia,  forgetting her assumption of grief, and becoming very genuine in her spiteful feeling  towards Eleanor, as a possible rival, &ldquo;nor do I know <em>what</em> you can have had  to say to him. But I do know that you have not exhibited very good taste in intruding  upon us at such an hour as this, and, above all, in remaining, now that you hear  the sad affliction&rdquo;&mdash;the handkerchief went to the eyes again here&mdash;&ldquo;which has befallen  us. If you come here,&rdquo; added Miss Lavinia, suddenly becoming spiteful again, &ldquo;in  the hope of ascertaining how my uncle&rsquo;s money has been left&mdash;and it would be only  like <em>some</em> people to do so&mdash;I can give you <em>no</em> information upon the subject.  The gardener has been sent to Windsor  to summon Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s clerk. Mr. Lawford himself started some days ago for New York on business. It&rsquo;s  very unlucky that he should be away at such a time, for we put every confidence  in him. However, I suppose the clerk will do as well. He will put seals on my uncle&rsquo;s  effects, I believe, and nothing will be known about the will until the day of the  funeral. But I do not think <em>you</em> need trouble yourself upon the subject, my  dear Mrs. Monckton, as I perfectly remember my beloved relative telling you very  distinctly that he had no idea of leaving you anything except a picture, or something  of that kind. We shall be very happy to see that you get the picture,&rdquo; concluded  the lady, with frigid politeness.</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton stood with one hand pushing the glossy ripples of auburn hair away from  her forehead, and with a look upon her face which the Misses de Crespigny&mdash;whose  minds had run in one very narrow groove for the last twenty years&mdash;could only construe  into some disappointment upon the subject of the will. Eleanor recovered her self-command  with an effort, as Miss Lavinia finished speaking, and said, very quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe  me, I do not want to inherit any of Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s property. I am very, very  sorry that he is dead, for there was something that I wanted to tell him before  he died; something that I ought to have told him long ago. I have been foolish&mdash;cowardly&mdash;to  wait so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  said the last words not to the two ladies, but to herself; and then, after a pause,  she added, slowly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope  your uncle has left his fortune to you and your sister, Miss Lavinia. Heaven grant  that he may have left it so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately  the Misses de Crespigny were in the humour to take offence at anything. The terrible  torture of suspense which was gnawing at the heart of each of the dead man&rsquo;s nieces  disposed them to be snappish to any one who came in their way. To them, to-night,  it seemed as if the earth was peopled by expectant legatees, all eager to dispute  for the heritage which by right was theirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  are extremely obliged to you for your good wishes, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; Miss Sarah said,  with vinegary politeness, &ldquo;and we can perfectly appreciate their sincerity. <em>Good</em> evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this  hint, the butler opened the door with a solemn flourish, and the two ladies bowed  Eleanor out of the house. The door closed behind her, and she went slowly down the  steps, lingering without purpose, entirely bewildered by the turn that events had  taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;  she exclaimed, in a half-whisper, &ldquo;dead! I never thought that he would die so soon.  I waited, and waited, thinking that, whenever the time came for me to speak, he  would be alive to hear me; and now he is dead, and I have lost my chance; I have  lost my one chance of avenging my father&rsquo;s death. The law cannot touch Launcelot  Darrell; but this old man had the power to punish him, and would have used that  power, if he had known the story of his friend&rsquo;s death. I cannot doubt that. I cannot  doubt that Maurice de Crespigny dearly loved my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton stopped for a few minutes at the bottom of the steps, trying to collect  her senses&mdash;trying to think if there was anything more for her to do.</p>
<p>No,  there was nothing. The one chance which fortune, by a series of events, not one  of which had been of her own contriving, had thrown into her way, was lost. She  could do nothing but go quietly home, and wait for the reading of the will, which  might, or might not, make Launcelot Darrell the owner of a noble estate.</p>
<p>But  then she remembered Richard Thornton&rsquo;s visit to Windsor, and the inferences he had drawn from  the meeting between Launcelot and the lawyer&rsquo;s clerk. Richard had most firmly believed  that the property was left away from the young man; and Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s conduct  since that day had gone far towards confirming the scene-painter&rsquo;s assertion. There  was very little doubt, then, that the will which had been drawn up by Mr. Lawford  and witnessed by Gilbert Monckton, was a will that left Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s fortune  away from Launcelot Darrell. The old man had spoken of a duty which he meant to  perform. Surely he must have alluded to his two nieces&rsquo; devotion, and the recompense  which they had earned by their patient attendance upon him. Such untiring watchers  generally succeed in reaping the reward of their labours; and why should it be otherwise  in this case?</p>
<p>But  then, on the other hand, the old man was fretful and capricious. His nerves had  been shattered by a long illness. How often, in the watches of the night, he might  have lain awake, pondering upon the disposal of his wealth, and doubtful what to  do with it, in his desire to act for the best! It was known that he had made other  wills, and had burned them when the humour seized him. He had had ample opportunity  for changing his mind. He had very likely destroyed the will witnessed by Gilbert  Monckton, in order to make a new one in Launcelot&rsquo;s favour.</p>
<p>Eleanor  stood at the bottom of the broad flight of steps with her hand upon the iron railing,  thinking of all this. Then, with a regretful sigh, she walked away from the front  of the house.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter42"></a>Chapter 42<br>
  In The Presence Of The Dead</strong></h2>
<p>The rooms that had been occupied by Maurice de Crespigny were at the back of  the house, and Eleanor, returning by the way that she had come, had occasion to  pass once more through the garden and shrubbery upon which the windows of these  rooms looked.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton paused amongst the evergreens that grew near the house, sheltering and  darkening the windows with their thick luxuriance. The Venetian shutters outside  the windows of the room in which the dead man lay were closed, and the light within  shone brightly between the slanting laths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor  old man,&rdquo; Eleanor murmured, as she looked mournfully towards this death-chamber,  &ldquo;he was very good to me; I ought to be sorry for his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  evergreens which grew in groups on either side of the windows made a thick screen,  behind which half-a-dozen people might have safely hidden themselves upon this moonless  and starless February night. Eleanor lingered for a few moments amongst these clustering  laurels before she emerged upon the patch of smooth turf which was scarcely large  enough to be dignified with the title of a lawn.</p>
<p>As she  lingered, partly because of a regretful tenderness towards the dead man, partly  because of that irresolution and uncertainty that had taken possession of her mind  from the moment in which she had heard of his death, she was startled once more  by the rustling of the branches near her. This time she was not left long in doubt:  the rustling of the branches was followed by a hissing whisper, very cautious and  subdued, but at the same time very distinct in the stillness; and Eleanor Monckton  was not slow to recognise the accent of the French commercial traveller, Monsieur  Victor Bourdon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  shutters are not fastened,&rdquo; this man whispered; &ldquo;there is a chance yet, <em>mon ami</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  speaker was within two paces of Eleanor, but she was hidden from him by the shrubs.  The companion to whom he had spoken was of course Launcelot Darrell; there could  be no doubt of that. But why were these men here? Had the artist come in ignorance  of his kinsman&rsquo;s death, and in the hope of introducing himself secretly into the  old man&rsquo;s apartments, and thus out-man&oelig;uvring the maiden nieces?</p>
<p>As the  two men moved nearer one of the windows of the bedchamber, moving very cautiously,  but still disturbing the branches as they went, Eleanor drew back, and stood, motionless,  almost breathless, close against the blank wall between the long French windows.</p>
<p>In another  moment Launcelot Darrell and his companion were standing so close to her, that she  could hear their hurried breathing as distinctly as she heard her own. The Frenchman  softly drew back one of the Venetian shutters a few inches, and peeped very cautiously  through the narrow aperture into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  is only an old woman there,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;an old woman, very grey, very respectable;  she is asleep, I think; look and see who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur  Bourdon drew back as he spoke, making way for Launcelot Darrell. The young man obeyed  his companion, but in a half-sulky, half-unwilling fashion, which was very much  like his manner on the Parisian Boulevard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  is it?&rdquo; whispered the Frenchman, as Launcelot leant forward and peered into the  lighted room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Jepcott, my uncle&rsquo;s house-keeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  she a friend of yours, or an enemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend,  I think. I know that she hates my aunts. She would rather serve me than serve them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.  We are not going to trust Mrs. Jepcott; but it&rsquo;s as well to know that she is friendly  towards us. Now, listen to me, my friend, we must have the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose  we must,&rdquo; muttered Launcelot Darrell, very sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  suppose we must! Bah!&rdquo; whispered the Frenchman, with intense scornfulness of manner.  &ldquo;It is likely we should draw back, after having gone so far as we have gone, and  made such promises as we have made. It is like you Englishmen, to turn cowards at  the very last, in any difficult business like this. You are very brave and very  grand so long as you can make a great noise about your honour, and your courage,  and your loyalty; so long as the drums are beating and the flags flying, and all  the world looking on to admire you. But the moment there is anything of difficult&mdash;anything  of a little hazardous, or anything of criminal, perhaps,&mdash;you draw back, you have  fear. Bah! I have no patience with you. You are a great nation, but you have never  produced a great impostor. Your Perkin Warbecks, your Stuart Pretenders, they are  all the same. They ride up hills with forty thousand men, and,&rdquo;&mdash;here Monsieur Bourdon  hissed out a very big French oath, to give strength to his assertion,&mdash;&ldquo;when they  get to the top they can do nothing better than ride down again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is  not to be supposed that, in so critical a situation as that in which the two men  had placed themselves, the Frenchman would have said all this without a purpose.  He knew Launcelot Darrell, and he knew that ridicule was the best spur with which  to urge him on when he was inclined to come to a stand-still. The young man&rsquo;s pride  took fire at his companion&rsquo;s scornful banter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you want me to do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want  you to go into that room and look for your uncle&rsquo;s keys. I would do it, and perhaps  do it better than you, but if that woman woke and found me there, she would rouse  the house; if she wakes up and sees you, any sentimental story of your desire to  look for the last time upon your kinsman and benefactor will satisfy her and stop  her mouth. You must search for the keys, Monsieur Robert Lance, pardon!&mdash;Monsieur  Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man made no immediate answer to this speech. He stood close to the window,  with the half-open shutter in his hand, and Eleanor could see, by the motion of  this shutter, that he was trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  do it, Bourdon,&rdquo; he gasped, after a long pause; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it. To go up to that  dead man&rsquo;s bed-side and <em>steal</em> his keys. It seems like an act of sacrilege&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;<em>can&rsquo;t</em> do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  commercial traveller shrugged his shoulders so high that it almost seemed he never  meant to bring them down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;<em>C&rsquo;est fini!</em> Live and die a pauper, Monsieur Darrell, but never  again ask me to help you in a great scheme. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Frenchman made a show of walking off, but went slowly, and gave Launcelot plenty  of time to stop him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,  Bourdon,&rdquo; the young man muttered; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be a fool. If you mean to stand by me in  this business, you must have a little patience. I&rsquo;ll do what must be done, of course,  however unpleasant it may be. I&rsquo;ve no reason to feel any great compunction about  the old man. He hasn&rsquo;t shown so much love for me that I need have any very sentimental  affection for him. I&rsquo;ll go in and look for the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had  opened the shutter to its widest extent, and he put his hand upon the window as  he spoke, but the Frenchman checked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Monsieur Bourdon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to look for the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  that way. If you open that window the cold air will blow into the room and awaken  the old woman&mdash;what you call her&mdash;Madame Jepcott. No, you must take off your boots,  and go in through one of the windows of the other rooms. We saw just now that those  rooms are empty. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two men moved away towards the windows of the sitting-room. Eleanor crept to the  Venetian shutters which Launcelot had closed, and, drawing one of them a little  way open, looked into the room in which the dead man lay. The housekeeper, Mrs.  Jepcott, sat in a roomy easy-chair, close to the fire, which burned brightly, and  had evidently been very lately replenished. The old woman&rsquo;s head had fallen back  upon the cushion of her chair, and the monotonous regularity of her snores gave  sufficient evidence of the soundness of her slumbers. Voluminous curtains of dark  green damask were drawn closely round the massive four-post bed; a thick wax candle,  in an old-fashioned silver candlestick, burned upon the table by the bedside, and  a pair of commoner candles, in brass candlesticks, brought, no doubt, from the housekeeper&rsquo;s  room, stood upon a larger table near the fireplace.</p>
<p>Nothing  had been disturbed since the old man&rsquo;s death. The maiden ladies had made a merit  of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  shall disturb nothing,&rdquo; Miss Lavinia, who was the more loquacious of the two, had  said; &ldquo;we shall not pry about or tamper with any of our beloved relative&rsquo;s effects.  You will take care of everything in your master&rsquo;s room, Jepcott; we place everything  under your charge, and you will see that nothing is touched; you will take care  that not so much as a pocket-handkerchief shall be disturbed until Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s  clerk comes from Windsor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In accordance  with these directions, everything had remained exactly as it had been left at the  moment of Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s death. The practised sick-nurse had retired, after  doing her dismal duty; the stiffening limbs had been composed in the last calm sleep;  the old man&rsquo;s eyelids had been closed upon the sightless eyeballs; the curtains  had been drawn; and that was all.</p>
<p>The  medicine bottles, the open Bible, the crumpled handkerchiefs, the purse, and paper-knife,  and spectacles, and keys, lying in disorder upon the table by the bed, had not been  touched. Eager as the dead man&rsquo;s nieces were to know the contents of his will, the  thought of obtaining that knowledge by any surreptitious means had never for one  moment entered into the head of either. They were conscientious ladies, who attended  church three times upon a Sunday, and who would have recoiled aghast from before  the mere thought of any infraction of the law.</p>
<p>Eleanor,  with the Venetian shutter a very little way open, and with her face close against  the window, stood looking into the lighted room, and waiting for Launcelot Darrell  to appear.</p>
<p>The  great four-post bedstead stood opposite the windows, the door was on Eleanor&rsquo;s right  hand. About five minutes elapsed before there was any sign of the intruder&rsquo;s coming.  Then the door was opened, very slowly, and Launcelot Darrell crept into the room.</p>
<p>His  face was almost livid, and he trembled violently. At first he looked helplessly  about him, as if paralysed by fear. Then he took a handkerchief from his pocket,  and wiped the cold perspiration from his forehead, still looking helplessly right  and left.</p>
<p>But  presently the Frenchman&rsquo;s head appeared round the edge of the door, which Launcelot  Darrell had left a little way open, a fat little hand pointed to the table by the  bed, and Monsieur Bourdon&rsquo;s hissing whisper vibrated in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;V&rsquo;l&agrave;,&mdash;the  table&mdash;the table&mdash;straight before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following  this indication, the young man began with trembling hands to search amongst the  disorder of the littered table. He had not occasion to seek very long for what he  wanted. The dead man&rsquo;s keys lay under one of the handkerchiefs. They jingled a little  as Launcelot took them up, and Mrs. Jepcott stirred in her sleep, but she did not  open her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  away, come!&rdquo; whispered the Frenchman, as Launcelot stood with the keys in his hand,  as if too much bewildered even to know that his purpose was accomplished. He obeyed  Monsieur Bourdon, and hurried from the room. He had taken off his boots at his companion&rsquo;s  instigation, and his stockinged feet made no sound upon the thick carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is he going to do with those keys?&rdquo; Eleanor thought. &ldquo;If he knows the contents of  the will, as Richard believed, what good can the keys be to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  still looked into the lighted bed-chamber, wondering what could happen next. Where  had Launcelot Darrell gone, and what was he going to do with the keys? She crept  along by the side of the house, past the window of the dressing-room, which was  still dark, and stopped when she came to the window of the old man&rsquo;s study. All  the windows upon this floor were in the same style&mdash;long French windows, opening  to the ground, and they were all sheltered by Venetian shutters. The shutters of  the sitting-room were closed, but the window was open, and through the bars of the  shutters Eleanor saw a faint glimmer of light.</p>
<p>She  drew the shutter nearest her a little way open, and looked into the room. The light  that she had seen came from a very small bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern, which the Frenchman  held in his hand. He was standing over Launcelot Darrell, who was on his knees before  the lower half of an old-fashioned <em>secr&eacute;taire</em>, at which Mr. de Crespigny  had been in the habit of writing, and in which he had kept papers.</p>
<p>The  lower half of this <em>secr&eacute;taire</em> contained a great many little drawers, which  were closed in by a pair of inlaid ebony doors. The doors were open now, and Launcelot  Darrell was busy examining the contents of the drawers one by one. His hands still  trembled, and he went to work slowly and awkwardly. The Frenchman, whose nerves  appeared in no way shaken, contrived to throw the light of the bull&rsquo;s-eye always  upon the papers in the young man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you found what you want?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  there&rsquo;s nothing yet; nothing but leases, receipts, letters, bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be  quick! Remember we have to put the keys back, and to get away. Have you the other  ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  spoke in whispers, but their whispers were perhaps more distinct than their ordinary  tones would have been. Eleanor could hear every word they said.</p>
<p>There  was a long pause, during which Launcelot Darrell opened and shut several drawers,  taking a hurried survey of their contents. Presently he uttered a half-smothered  cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  got it?&rdquo; exclaimed the Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put  in the substitute then, and lock the cabinet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell threw the document which he had taken from the drawer upon a chair near  him, and took another paper from his pocket. He put this second paper in the place  from which he had taken the first, and then shut the drawer, and closed and locked  the doors of the cabinet. He did all this in nervous haste, and neither he nor his  companion perceived that a third paper, very much like the first in shape and size,  had fallen out of one of the drawers and lay upon the carpet before the cabinet.</p>
<p>Now,  for the first time, Eleanor Monckton began to comprehend the nature of the conspiracy  which she had witnessed. Launcelot Darrell and his accomplice had substituted a  fictitious paper for the real will signed by Maurice de Crespigny and witnessed  by Gilbert Monckton and the lawyer&rsquo;s clerk. The genuine document was that which  Launcelot Darrell had flung upon the chair by the side of the <em>secr&eacute;taire</em>.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter43"></a>Chapter 43<br>
  A Brief Triumph</strong></h2>
<p>Eleanor Monckton&rsquo;s first impulse was to rush into the room and denounce Launcelot  Darrell in the presence of those who would be sure to come in answer to her call.  He would be scarcely likely to find much mercy at the hands of his aunts: he would  stand before them a detected wretch, capable of any crime, of any treachery, for  the furtherance of his own interest.</p>
<p>But  a second impulse, as rapid as the first, restrained the impetuous girl. She wanted  to know the end, she wanted to see what these two plotters would do next. Under  the influence of her desire to rush into the room, she had moved forward a few paces,  rustling the leaves about her as she stirred. The Frenchman&rsquo;s acute hearing had  detected that rustling sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick,  quick,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;take the keys back, there is some one in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell had risen from his knees. The door between the study and the dressing-room  had been left ajar; the young man pushed it open, and hurried away with the keys  in his hand. Victor Bourdon closed his lantern, and came to the window. He thrust  aside the Venetian shutters, and stepped out into the garden. Eleanor crouched down  with her back flat against the wall, completely sheltered by the laurels. The Frenchman  commenced his search amongst the bushes on the right of the window, Eleanor&rsquo;s hiding-place  was on the left. This gave her a moment&rsquo;s breathing time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  will!&rdquo; she thought in that one moment, &ldquo;they have left the genuine will upon the  chair by the cabinet. <em>If</em> I could get that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  thought had flashed like lightning through her brain. Reckless in her excitement,  she rose from her crouching position, and slid rapidly and noiselessly across the  threshold of the open window into the study, before Victor Bourdon had finished  his examination of the shrubs on the right.</p>
<p>Her  excitement seemed to intensify every sense. The only light in the room was a faint  ray which came across the small intermediate chamber from the open door of Maurice  de Crespigny&rsquo;s bed-room. This light was very little, but the open door was opposite  the cabinet, and what light there was fell upon the very spot towards which Eleanor&rsquo;s  dilated eyes looked. She could see the outline of the paper on the chair; she could  see the other paper on the floor, faint and grey in the dim glimmer from the distant  candles.</p>
<p>She  snatched the will from the chair, and thrust it into the pocket of her dress; she  picked up the other paper from the floor, and placed it on the chair. Then, with  her face and figure obscured in the loose cloak that shrouded her, she went back  into the garden.</p>
<p>As she  drew back into the shelter of the laurels she felt a man&rsquo;s garments brushing against  her own, and a man&rsquo;s hot breath upon her cheek. The Frenchman had passed her so  closely that it was almost impossible he could have failed to perceive her presence:  and yet he had seemed utterly unconscious of it.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell came back to the study almost the moment after Eleanor had left it. He was  breathing quickly, and stopped to wipe his forehead once more with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bourdon!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, in a loud whisper, &ldquo;Bourdon, where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Frenchman crossed the threshold of the window as the young man called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  been on the look-out for spies,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you seen any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  I fancy it was a false alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  then,&rdquo; said Launcelot Darrell, &ldquo;we have been luckier than I thought we should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t  you better unlock that door before we leave?&rdquo; asked Monsieur Bourdon, pointing to  the door which communicated with the other part of the house. Launcelot had locked  it on first entering the study, and had thus secured himself from any surprise in  that direction. The two men were going away when Monsieur Bourdon stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  forgotten something, my friend,&rdquo; he whispered, laying his hand on Launcelot&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  will, the genuine will,&rdquo; answered the Frenchman, pointing to the chair. &ldquo;It would  be a clever thing to leave that behind, eh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  started, and put his hand to his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must  be mad,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;this business is too much for my brain. Why did you lead  me into it, Bourdon? Are you the Devil, that you must always prompt me to some new  mischief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  shall ask me that next week, my friend, when you are the master of this house. Get  that paper there, and come away: unless you want to stop till your maiden aunts  make their appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell snatched up the paper which Eleanor had put upon the chair by the cabinet.  He was going to thrust it into his breast-pocket, when the Frenchman took it away  from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t particularly want to keep that document; or to drop it anywhere about the  garden; do you? We&rsquo;ll burn it, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you, and save them all trouble  at&mdash;what you call your law court,&mdash;Common doctors, Proctor&rsquo;s Commons, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur  Bourdon had put his bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern in his coat-pocket, after looking for spies  amongst the evergreens. He now produced a box of fusees, and setting one of them  alight, watched it fizz and sparkle for a moment, and then held it beneath the corner  of the document in his left hand.</p>
<p>The  paper was slow to catch fire, and Monsieur Bourdon had occasion to light another  fusee before he succeeded in doing more than scorching it. But it blazed up by-and-by,  and by the light of the blaze Eleanor Monckton saw the eager faces of the two men.  Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s livid countenance was almost like that of a man who looks on  at an assassination. The commercial traveller watched the slow burning of the document  with a smile upon his face&mdash;a smile of triumph, as it seemed to Eleanor Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;V&rsquo;l&agrave;!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, as the paper dropped, a frail sheet of tinder, from his hand, and  fluttered slowly to the ground. &ldquo;V&rsquo;l&agrave;!&rdquo; he cried, stamping upon the feathery gray  ashes; &ldquo;so much for that; and now our little scheme of to-night is safe, I fancy,  my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  God it&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go through this business again for twenty  fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor,  still crouching upon the damp grass close against the wall, waited for the two men  to go away. She waited, with her hands clasped upon her heart; thinking of her triumph.</p>
<p>The  vengeance had come at last. That which she had said to Richard Thornton was about  to be fulfilled. The law of the land had no power to punish Launcelot Darrell for  the cowardly and treacherous act that had led to an old man&rsquo;s most miserable death:  but the traitor had by a new crime placed himself at the mercy of the law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  will he has placed in the cabinet is a forgery,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;and I have the real  will in my pocket. He cannot escape me now,&mdash;he cannot escape me now! His fate is  in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two men had walked past the laurels out on to the grass-plat. Eleanor rose from  her crouching position, rustling the branches as she did so. At the same moment  she heard voices in the distance, and saw a light gleaming through the leaves.</p>
<p>One  of the voices that she had heard was her husband&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  much the better,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I will tell him what Launcelot Darrell is. I will  tell him to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  voices and the lights came nearer, and she heard Gilbert Monckton say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,  Miss Sarah. Why should my wife stop here? She must have gone back to Tolldale; and  I have been unlucky enough to miss her on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lawyer had scarcely spoken when, by the light of the lantern which he held, he saw  Launcelot Darrell making off into the shrubbery that surrounded the grass-plat.  The young man had not succeeded in escaping from the open space into this friendly  shelter before Gilbert Monckton perceived him. Monsieur Bourdon, perhaps better  accustomed to take to his heels, had been more fortunate, and had plunged in amongst  the evergreens at the first sound of the lawyer&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darrell!&rdquo;  cried Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;what in Heaven&rsquo;s name brings you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man stood for a few moments, irresolute, and sullen-looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  as good a right to be here as any one else, I suppose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I heard of my  uncle&rsquo;s death&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I came to ascertain if there was any truth in the report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  heard of my beloved uncle&rsquo;s death!&rdquo; cried Miss Sarah de Crespigny, peering sharply  at her nephew from under the shadow of a penthouse-like garden-hood, in which she  had invested herself before venturing into the night-air. &ldquo;How <em>could</em> you  have heard of the sad event. My sister and I gave special orders that no report  should go abroad until to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell did not care to say that one of the Woodlands servants was in his pay; and  that the same servant, being no other than Brooks the gardener, had galloped over  to Hazlewood, to communicate the tidings of his master&rsquo;s death, before starting  for Windsor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>did</em> hear of it,&rdquo; Launcelot said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s enough. I came to ascertain if it was true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you were going away from the house when I saw you!&rdquo; said Mr. Monckton, rather suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was  not going away from the house, for I had not been to the house,&rdquo; Launcelot answered  in the same tone as before.</p>
<p>He spake  in a sulky grudging manner, because he knew that he was telling a deliberate lie.  He was a man who always did wrong acts under protest, as being forced to do them  by the injustice of the world; and he held society responsible for all his errors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you seen my wife?&rdquo; Gilbert asked, still suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.  I have only this moment come. I have not seen anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>must</em> have missed her,&rdquo; muttered the lawyer, with an anxious air. &ldquo;I must have missed  her between this and Tolldale. Nobody saw her leave the house. She went out without  leaving any message, and I guessed at once that she had come up here. It&rsquo;s very  odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> very odd!&rdquo; Miss Sarah repeated, with spiteful emphasis. &ldquo;I must confess  that for my own part I do not see what motive Mrs. Monckton could have had for rushing  up here in the dead of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  time which Miss Sarah de Crespigny spoke of as the dead of the night had been something  between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock. It was now past eleven.</p>
<p>The  lawyer and Miss de Crespigny walked slowly along the gravelled pathway that led  from the grass-plat and shrubbery to the other side of the house. Launcelot Darrell  went with them, lounging by his aunt&rsquo;s side, with his head down, and his hands in  his pockets, stopping now and then to kick the pebbles from his pathway.</p>
<p>It was  impossible to imagine anything more despicable than this young man&rsquo;s aspect. Hating  himself for what he had done; hating the man who had prompted him to do it; angry  against the very workings of Providence&mdash;since by his reasoning it was Providence,  or his Destiny, or some power or other against which he had ample ground for rebellion,  that had caused all the mischief and dishonour of his life&mdash;he went unwillingly to  act out the part which he had taken upon himself, and to do his best to throw Gilbert  Monckton off the scent.</p>
<p>His  mind was too much disturbed for him to be able clearly to realise the danger of  his position. To have been seen there was ruin&mdash;perhaps! If by-and-by any doubts  should arise as to the validity of the will that would be found in Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s <em>secr&eacute;taire</em>, would it not be remembered that he, Launcelot Darrell, had been  seen lurking about the house on the night of the old man&rsquo;s death, and had been only  able to give a very lame explanation of his motives for being there. He thought  of this as he walked by his aunt&rsquo;s side. He thought of this, and began to wonder  if it might not be possible to undo what had been done? No, it was impossible. The  crime had been committed. A step had been taken which could never be retraced, for  Victor Bourdon had burned the real will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse  his officiousness,&rdquo; thought the young man. &ldquo;I could have undone it all but for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the  lawyer and his two companions reached the angle of the house on their way to the  front entrance, whence Mr. Monckton and Miss de Crespigny had come into the garden,  a dark figure shrouded in a loose cloak emerged from amidst the shrubs by the windows  of the dead man&rsquo;s apartments, and approached them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  is that?&rdquo; cried the lawyer suddenly. His heart began to beat violently as he asked  the question. It was quite a supererogatory question; for he knew well enough that  it was his wife who stood before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is I, Gilbert,&rdquo; Eleanor said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  here, Mrs. Monckton!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband, in a harsh voice, that seemed to ring  through the air like the vibration of metal that has been struck,&mdash;&ldquo;you here, hiding  in this shrubbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I came here&mdash;how long ago, Miss Sarah? It seems half a century to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  came here exactly twenty minutes ago, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; Miss de Crespigny answered  icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  by a really remarkable coincidence,&rdquo; cried Gilbert Monckton, in the same unnatural  voice in which he had spoken before, &ldquo;Mr. Darrell happens to be here too: only I  must do you the justice to say, Mrs. Monckton, that <em>you</em> appear less discomposed  than the gentleman. Ladies always have the advantage of us; they can carry off these  things so easily; deception seems to come natural to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deception!&rdquo;  repeated Eleanor.</p>
<p>What  did he mean? Why was he angry with her? She wondered at his manner as she walked  with him to the house. No suspicion of the real nature of her husband&rsquo;s feelings  entered her mind. The absorbing idea of her life was the desire to punish her father&rsquo;s  destroyer; and how could she imagine that her husband was tortured by jealous suspicions  of this man: of this man, who of all the living creatures upon the earth was most  hateful to her? How could she,&mdash;knowing her own feelings, and taking it for granted  that these feelings were more or less obvious to other people,&mdash;how could she imagine  the state of Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>She  went into the hall with her husband, followed by Miss Sarah de Crespigny and Launcelot  Darrell, and from the hall into the sitting-room usually occupied by the two ladies.  A lamp burned brightly upon the centre table, and Miss Lavinia de Crespigny sat  near it; with some devotional book in her hand. I think she tried her best to be  devout, and to employ herself with serious reflections upon the dread event that  had so lately happened; but the fatal power of the old man&rsquo;s wealth was stronger  than any holier influence, and I fear that Miss Lavinia&rsquo;s thoughts very often wandered  away from the page on which her eyes were fixed, into sundry intricate calculations  of the cumulative interest upon Exchequer bills, India five per cents., and Great  Western Railway shares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must  have an explanation of this business,&rdquo; Mr. Monckton said: &ldquo;it is time that we should  all understand each other. There has been too much mystification, and I am most  heartily tired of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked  to the fire-place and leaned his elbow upon the marble chimney-piece. From this  position he commanded a view of every one in the room. Launcelot Darrell flung himself  into a chair by the table, nearly opposite his aunt Lavinia. He did not trouble  himself to notice this lady, nor did he bow to Eleanor; he sat with his elbow resting  upon the arm of his chair, his chin in the palm of his hand, and he employed himself  by biting his nails and beating his heel upon the carpet. He was still thinking  as he had thought in the garden, &ldquo;If I could only undo what I have done. If I could  only undo the work of the last quarter of an hour, and stand right with the world  again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  in this intense desire that had taken possession of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s mind there  was mingled no regretful horror of the wickedness of what he had done; no remorseful  sense of the great injustice which he had plotted; no wish to atone or to restore.  It was selfishness alone that influenced his every thought. He wanted to put <em>himself</em> right. He hated this new position, which for the last few minutes he had occupied  for the first time in his life; the position of a deliberate criminal, amenable  to the laws by which the commonest felons are tried, likely to suffer as the commonest  felons suffer.</p>
<p>It seemed  to him as if his brain had been paralysed until now; it seemed to him as if he had  acted in a stupor or a dream; and that he now for the first time comprehended the  nature of the deed which he had done, and was able to foresee the possible consequences  of his own act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  committed forgery,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;If my crime is discovered I shall be sent to Bermuda to work amongst gangs of murderous ruffians till I  drop down dead. If my crime is discovered! How shall I ever be safe from discovery,  when I am at the mercy of the wretches who helped me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  threw off her cloak, but she refused to sit down in the chair which Miss Sarah offered  her. She stood divided by the width of half the room from her husband, with her  face fronting his, in the full glare of the lamplight. Her large gray eyes were  bright with excitement, her cheeks were flushed, her hair fell loosely about her  face, and, brown in the shadow, glittered like ruddy gold in the light.</p>
<p>In all  the beauty of her girlhood, from the hour in which Gilbert Monckton had first seen  her until to-night, she had never looked so beautiful as she looked now. The sense  that she had triumphed, the thought that she held the power to avenge her father&rsquo;s  death, lent an unnatural brilliancy to her loveliness. She was no longer an ordinary  woman, only gifted with the earthly charms of lovely womanhood: she was a splendid  Nemesis, radiant with a supernatural beauty.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter44"></a>Chapter 44<br>
  Lost</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You asked me why I came  here to-night,&rdquo; she said, looking at her husband. &ldquo;I will tell you, Gilbert: but  I must tell you a long story first, almost all the story of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  voice, resonant and musical, roused Launcelot Darrell from his gloomy abstraction.  He looked up at Eleanor, and for the first time began to wonder how and why she  had come there. They had met her in the garden. Why had she been there? What had  she been doing there? Could it be possible that she had played the spy upon him?  No! Surely there could be no fear of that? What reason should <em>she</em> have for  suspecting or watching him? <em>That</em> terror was too cowardly, too absurd, he  thought; but such foolish and unnecessary fears would be the perpetual torment of  his life henceforward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  remember, Gilbert,&rdquo; Eleanor continued, &ldquo;that when I promised to be your wife, I  told you my real name, and asked you to keep that name a secret from the people  in this house; and from Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even  in the midst of the tortures which arose out of his jealousy and suspicion, and  which to-night had reached their climax, and had taken entire possession of the  lawyer&rsquo;s mind, there was some half-doubtful feeling of wonder at Eleanor&rsquo;s calm  and self-assured manner.</p>
<p>And  yet she was deceiving him. He knew that. He had long ago determined that this second  hazard of his life was to result in ignominious failure, like the first. He had  been deceived before; gulled, hoodwinked, fooled, jilted: and the traitress had  smiled in his face, with the innocent smile of a guileless child. Eleanor was perhaps  even more skilled in treachery than that first traitress; but that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  not be deluded by her again,&rdquo; he thought, as he looked gloomily at the beautiful  face opposite to him: &ldquo;<em>nothing</em> she can say shall make me her dupe again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall  I tell you why I asked you to keep that secret for me, Gilbert?&rdquo; continued Eleanor;  &ldquo;I did so because I had a motive for coming back to the neighbourhood of this place.  A motive that was stronger than my love for you&mdash;though I did love you, Gilbert,  better than I thought; if I thought at all of anything except that other motive  which was the one purpose of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton&rsquo;s upper lip curled scornfully. Love him! That was too poor a fancy. What  had he ever been but a dupe and a cat&rsquo;s-paw for a false woman; fooled and cheated  many years ago in his early manhood; fooled and cheated to-day in his prime of life.  He smiled contemptuously at the thought of his own folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Launcelot  Darrell,&rdquo; cried Eleanor, suddenly, in an altered voice, &ldquo;shall I tell <em>you</em> why I was so eager to come back to this neighbourhood? Shall I tell you why I wanted  the secret of my name kept from you and from your kindred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man lifted his head and looked at Eleanor. Wonder and terror were both expressed  in his countenance. He wondered why Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s wife addressed him with such  earnestness. He was afraid without knowing what he feared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know what you mean, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;What could I have to do with your  false name,&mdash;or your coming back to this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything!&rdquo;  cried Eleanor: &ldquo;it was to be near you that I came back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought  as much,&rdquo; muttered the lawyer, under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was to be near you that I came back,&rdquo; Eleanor repeated, &ldquo;it was to be near you,  Launcelot Darrell, that I was so eager to come back: so eager, that I would have  stooped to any stratagem, encountered any risk, if by so doing I could have hastened  my return. It was for this that I took the most solemn step a woman can take, without  stopping to think of its solemnity. It was to deceive you that I kept my name a  secret. It was to denounce you as the wretch who cheated a helpless old man out  of the money that was not his own, and thus drove him to a shameful and a sinful  death, that I came here. I have watched and waited long for this moment. It has  come at last. Thank Heaven, it has come at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell rose suddenly from his chair. His white face was still turned towards Eleanor;  his eyes were fixed in a stare of horror. At first, perhaps, he contemplated rushing  out of the room, and getting away from this woman, who had recalled the sin of the  past, at a moment when his brain was maddened by the crime of the present. But he  stopped, fascinated by some irresistible power in the beautiful face before him.  Eleanor stood between the coward and the door. He could not pass her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know who I am now, Launcelot Darrell, and you know how much mercy you can expect  from me,&rdquo; this girl continued, in the clear, ringing voice in which she had first  addressed her enemy. &ldquo;You remember the eleventh of August. You remember the night  upon which you met my father upon the Boulevard. I stood by his side upon that night.  I was hanging upon his arm, when you and your vile associate tempted him away from  me. Heaven knows how dearly I loved him; Heaven knows how happily I looked forward  to a life in which I might be with him and work for him. Heaven only knows how happily  that bright dream might have been realised&mdash;but for you&mdash;but for you. May an old man&rsquo;s  sin rest upon your head. May a daughter&rsquo;s blighted hope rest upon your head. You  can guess now why I am here to-night, and what I have been doing; and you can guess,  perhaps, what mercy you have to expect from George Vane&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George  Vane&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah  and Lavinia de Crespigny lifted up their hands and eyes in mute dismay. Was this  woman, this viper, who had gained access to the very heart of the citadel which  they had guarded so jealously, the very creature who of all others they would have  kept remote from the dead man?</p>
<p>No!  it was impossible. Neither of Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s nieces had ever heard of the  birth of George Vane&rsquo;s youngest child. The old man had received tidings of the little  girl&rsquo;s advent in a letter sent by stealth, and had kept the intelligence a secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is too absurd!&rdquo; Miss Lavinia exclaimed; &ldquo;George Vane&rsquo;s youngest daughter is Hortensia  Bannister, and she must be at least five-and-thirty years of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell knew better than this. <em>He</em> could recall a dismal scene that had occurred  in the pale gray light of an August morning. He could remember a white-haired old  man, sitting amidst the sordid splendour of a second-rate coffee-house, crying about  his youngest daughter, and bewailing the loss of the money that was to have paid  for his darling&rsquo;s education; a wretched, broken-hearted old man, who had held his  trembling hands aloft, and cursed the wretch who had cheated him.</p>
<p>He could  see the figure now, with the shaking hands lifted high. He could see the wrinkled  face, very old and worn in that gray, morning light, and tears streaming from the  faded blue eyes. He had lived under the shadow of that curse ever since, and it  seemed as if it was coming home to him to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  Eleanor Vane,&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s wife said, in answer to Miss Lavinia. &ldquo;I am Hortensia  Bannister&rsquo;s half-sister. It was because of her foolish pride that I came to Hazlewood  under a false name. It was in order to be revenged upon Launcelot Darrell that I  have since kept my real name a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Vane! Eleanor Vane! Could it be true? Of all whom Launcelot Darrell had reason to  fear, this Eleanor Vane was the most to be dreaded. If he had never wronged her  father, even if he had not been indirectly the cause of the old man&rsquo;s death, he  would still have had reason to fear Eleanor Vane. He knew what that reason was,  and he dropped back into his chair, livid and trembling, as he had trembled when  he stole the keys from his dead uncle&rsquo;s bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice  de Crespigny and my father were bosom friends,&rdquo; continued Eleanor. Her voice changed  as she spoke of her father, and the light in her face faded as a tender shadow stole  over her countenance. She could not mention her father&rsquo;s name without tenderness,  speak of him when or where she might. &ldquo;They were bosom friends, everybody here knows  that; and my poor dear father had a foolish fancy that if Mr. de Crespigny died  before him, he would inherit this house and estate, and that he would be rich once  more, and that we should be very happy together. <em>I</em> never thought that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell looked up with a strange, eager glance, but said nothing. The sisters, however,  could not suffer Eleanor&rsquo;s words to pass without remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  never thought that; oh, dear no, I dare say not,&rdquo; Miss Lavinia observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course you never entered this house with any mercenary ideas upon the subject of  my dear uncle&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; Miss Sarah exclaimed, with biting irony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never  built any hope upon my dear father&rsquo;s fancy,&rdquo; resumed Eleanor, so indifferent to  the remarks of the two ladies that it seemed as if they had been unheard by her;  &ldquo;but I humoured it as I would have humoured any fancy of his, however foolish. But  after his death I remembered that Mr. de Crespigny had been his friend, and I only  waited to convince myself of that man&rsquo;s guilt&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed to Launcelot Darrell  as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;before I denounced him to his great-uncle. I thought that my father&rsquo;s  old friend would listen to me, and knowing what had been done, would never let a  traitor inherit his wealth. I thought that by this means I should be revenged upon  the man who caused my father&rsquo;s death. I heard to-day that Mr. de Crespigny had not  long to live; and when I came here to-night I came with the intention of telling  him the real character of the man who was perhaps to inherit his fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  maiden ladies looked at each other. It would not have been a bad thing, perhaps,  after all, if Eleanor had arrived in time to see the dying man. It was a pity that  Maurice de Crespigny should have died in ignorance of his nephew&rsquo;s character, when  there was just a chance that he might have left a will in that nephew&rsquo;s favour.  But on the other hand, George Vane&rsquo;s daughter was even a more formidable person  than Launcelot. Who could tell how she might have contrived to tamper with the old  man?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  no doubt you wished to denounce Mr. Darrell; and to denounce us, too, for the matter  of that, I dare say,&rdquo; observed Miss Sarah, &ldquo;in order that you yourself might profit  by my uncle&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> profit!&rdquo; cried Eleanor; &ldquo;what should I want with the poor old man&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  wife is rich enough to be above any suspicion of that kind, Miss de Crespigny,&rdquo;  Gilbert Monckton said, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came  too late,&rdquo; Eleanor said; &ldquo;I came too late to see my father&rsquo;s friend, but not too  late for what I have so long prayed for&mdash;revenge upon my father&rsquo;s destroyer. Look  at your sister&rsquo;s son, Miss de Crespigny. Look at him, Miss Lavinia; you have good  reason to be proud of him. He has been a liar and a traitor from first to last;  and to-night he has advanced from treachery to crime. The law could not punish him  for the cruelty that killed a helpless old man: the law can punish him for that  which he has done to-night, for he has committed a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  He has crept like a thief into the house in which his uncle lies dead, and has introduced  some document&mdash;a will of his own fabrication, no doubt&mdash;in the place of the genuine  will left in Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s private <em>secr&eacute;taire</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do <em>you</em> know this, Eleanor?&rdquo; cried Gilbert Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  it because I was outside the window of the study when he changed the papers in the  cabinet, and because I have the real will in my possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is a lie!&rdquo; shouted Launcelot Darrell, starting to his feet, &ldquo;a damnable lie, the  real will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was  burnt, as you think, Mr. Darrell; but you are mistaken. The document which your  friend Monsieur Victor Bourdon burnt was a paper which you dropped out of the <em>secr&eacute;taire</em> while you were searching for the will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  where is the genuine document, Eleanor?&rdquo; Gilbert asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo;  answered his wife, triumphantly.</p>
<p>She  put her hand into her pocket. It was empty. The will was gone.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter45"></a>Chapter 45<br>
  At Sea</strong></h2>
<p>The will was gone. Eleanor tried to think how or where she could have lost  it. It might have dropped from her pocket, perhaps. That was the only solution of  the mystery that presented itself to her mind. The open pocket of her dress might  have been caught by one of the laurel boughs as she crouched upon the ground, and  when she rose the paper had dropped out. There was no other way in which she <em>could</em> have lost it. She had been so absorbed in the watch she had kept on Launcelot Darrell,  as to forget the value of the document which she had thrust carelessly into her  pocket. Her father&rsquo;s letter and Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s sketch were still safe in the  bosom of her dress; but the will, the genuine will, in place of which the young  man had introduced some fabrication of his own, was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  me see this will, Eleanor,&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton said, advancing to his wife. Although  she had been the most skilful actress, the most accomplished deceiver amongst all  womankind, her conduct to-night could not be all acting, it could not be all deception.  She did not love him: she had confessed that, very plainly. She did not love him;  and she had only married him in order to serve a purpose of her own. But then, on  the other hand, if her passionate words were to be believed in, she did not love  Launcelot Darrell. There was some comfort in that. &ldquo;Let me see the will, Eleanor,&rdquo;  he repeated, as his wife stared at him blankly, in the first shock of her discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  find it,&rdquo; she said, hopelessly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone; it&rsquo;s lost. Oh, for pity&rsquo;s sake, go out  into the garden and look for it. I must have dropped it amongst the evergreens outside  Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s rooms. Pray go and look for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo;  the lawyer said, taking up his hat and walking towards the door of the room.</p>
<p>But  Miss Lavinia de Crespigny stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Monckton,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;pray don&rsquo;t go out into the night air. Parker is the proper  person to look for this document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  rang the bell, which was answered by the old butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has  Brooks come back from Windsor?&rdquo;  she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Miss, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A paper  has been dropped in the garden, Parker, somewhere amongst the evergreens, outside  my uncle&rsquo;s rooms. Will you take a lantern, and go and look for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,  dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Sarah, &ldquo;Brooks has been a very long time going from here to  Windsor and back  again. I wish Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s clerk were come. The place would be taken care of, then,  and we should have no further anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  lady looked suspiciously from her nephew to Eleanor, and from Eleanor to Gilbert  Monckton. She did not know whom to trust, or whom most to fear. Launcelot Darrell  sat before her, biting savagely at his nails, and with his head bent upon his breast.  Eleanor had sunk into the chair nearest her, utterly dumbfounded by the loss of  the will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  need not fear that we shall long intrude upon you, Miss de Crespigny,&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton  said. &ldquo;My wife has made an accusation against a person in this room. It is only  right, in your interest, and for the justification of her truth and honour, that  this business should be investigated&mdash;and immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  will <em>must</em> be found,&rdquo; Eleanor cried; &ldquo;it <em>must</em> have fallen from my pocket  in the shrubbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell said nothing. He waited the issue of the search that was being made. If  the will was found, he was prepared to repudiate it; for there was no other course  left to him. He hated this woman, who had suddenly arisen before him as an enemy  and denouncer, who had recalled to him the bitter memory of his first great dishonour,  and who had detected him in the commission of his first crime. He hated Eleanor,  and was ready to sacrifice her to his own safety.</p>
<p>He lifted  his head, presently, and looked about him with a scornful laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  this a farce, or a conspiracy, Mrs. Monckton?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Do you expect to invalidate  my great-uncle&rsquo;s genuine will&mdash;wherever that will may happen to be found&mdash;by the production  of some document dropped by you in the garden, and which has, very likely, never  been inside this house, much less in my uncle&rsquo;s possession. You surely don&rsquo;t expect  any one to believe your pretty, romantic story, of a suicide in Paris, and a midnight scene  at Woodlands? It would be an excellent paragraph for a hard-up penny-a-liner, but,  really, for any other purpose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take  care, Mr. Darrell,&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton said quietly, &ldquo;you will gain nothing by insolence.  If I do not resent your impertinence to my wife, it is because I begin to believe  that you are so despicable a scoundrel as to be unworthy of an honest man&rsquo;s anger.  You had much better hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was no particular eloquence in these last few words, but there was something in  the lawyer&rsquo;s tone that effectually silenced Launcelot Darrell. Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s cane  lay upon a chair by the fire-place, and while speaking he had set down his hat,  and taken up the cane; unconsciously, perhaps; but the movement had not escaped  the guilty man&rsquo;s furtive glance. He kept silence; and with his face darkened by  a gloomy scowl, still sat biting his nails. The will would be found. The genuine  document would be compared with the fabrication he had placed amongst his great-uncle&rsquo;s  papers, and perpetual shame, punishment, and misery would be his lot. What he suffered  to-night, sitting amongst these people, not one of whom he could count as a friend,  was only a foretaste of what he would have to suffer by-and-by in a criminal dock.</p>
<p>For  some time there was silence in the room. The two sisters, anxious and perplexed,  looked almost despairingly at each other, fearful that at the end of all this business  they would be the sufferers; cheated, in their helplessness, either by George Vane&rsquo;s  daughter or by Launcelot Darrell. Eleanor, exhausted by her own excitement, sat  with her eyes fixed upon the door, waiting for the coming of the old butler.</p>
<p>More  than a quarter of an hour passed in this way. Then the door opened, and Mr. Parker  made his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have found it!&rdquo; cried Eleanor, starting to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  ma&rsquo;am. No, Miss Lavinia,&rdquo; added the butler. &ldquo;I have searched every inch of the garding,  and there is nothink in the shape of a paper to be found. The housemaid was with  me, and she searched likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>must</em> be in the garden,&rdquo; exclaimed Eleanor, &ldquo;it must be there&mdash;unless it has  been blown away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  not wind enough for that, ma&rsquo;am. The s&rsquo;rubberies are &rsquo;igh, and it would take a deal  of wind to blow a paper across the tops of the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you&rsquo;ve searched the ground under the trees?&rdquo; asked Mr. Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. We&rsquo;ve searched everywhere; me and the &rsquo;ousemaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell burst into a loud laugh, an insolent, strident laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  I thought as much,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;the whole story is a farce. I beg your pardon, Mr.  Monckton, for calling it a conspiracy. It is merely a slight hallucination of your  wife&rsquo;s; and I dare say she is as much George Vane&rsquo;s daughter as I am the fabricator  of a forged will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Darrell&rsquo;s triumph had made him foolhardy. In the next moment Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s  hand was on the collar of his coat, and the cane uplifted above his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  my goodness me!&rdquo; shrieked Sarah de Crespigny, with a dismal wail, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be murder  done presently. Oh, this is too dreadful; in the dead of the night, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  before any harm could happen to Launcelot Darrell, Eleanor clung about her husband&rsquo;s  upraised arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  you said just now was the truth, Gilbert,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he is not worthy of it; he  is not, indeed. He is beneath an honest man&rsquo;s anger. Let him alone; for my sake  let him alone. Retribution must come upon him sooner or later. I thought it had  come to-night, but there has been witchcraft in all this business. I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,  Eleanor,&rdquo; said Gilbert Monckton, putting down his cane, and turning away from Launcelot  Darrell as he might have turned from a mongrel cur that he had been dissuaded from  punishing: &ldquo;This last will&mdash;what was the wording of it&mdash;to whom did it leave the fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell looked up, eagerly, breathlessly, waiting for Eleanor&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,  have you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I never knew anything about the contents of the will. I had no opportunity of looking  at it. I took it from the chair on which Launcelot Darrell threw it, and put it  in my pocket. From that moment to this I have never seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you know, then, that it was a will?&rdquo; asked Gilbert Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I heard Launcelot Darrell and his companion speak of it as the genuine will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man seemed infinitely relieved by the knowledge of Eleanor&rsquo;s ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  Mr. Monckton,&rdquo; he said, with an air of injured innocence, &ldquo;you have been very anxious  to investigate the grounds of your wife&rsquo;s accusation, and have been very ready to  believe in a most absurd story. You have even gone so far as to wish to execute  summary vengeance upon me with a walking-stick. I think it&rsquo;s my turn now to ask  a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  can ask as many as you please,&rdquo; answered the lawyer.</p>
<p>His  mind was bewildered by what had happened. Eleanor&rsquo;s earnestness, which had seemed  so real, had all ended in nothing. How if it was all acting; how if some darker  mystery lurked beneath all this tumult of accusation and denial? The canker of suspicion,  engendered by one woman&rsquo;s treachery, had taken deep root in Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s breast.  He had lost one of the purest and highest gifts of a noble nature: the power to  trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, then,&rdquo; said Launcelot Darrell, turning to Eleanor: &ldquo;Perhaps you will tell  me how I contrived to open this cabinet, out of which you say I stole one document,  and into which you declare I introduced another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  took the keys from Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!  But is there no one keeping watch in that room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  cried Miss Sarah, &ldquo;Jepcott is there. Jepcott has been there ever since my beloved  uncle expired. Nothing has been disturbed, and Jepcott has had the care of the room.  We could trust Jepcott with untold gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Miss Lavinia, &ldquo;with untold gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  she was asleep!&rdquo; cried Eleanor, &ldquo;the woman was asleep when that man went into the  room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep!&rdquo;  exclaimed Miss Sarah; &ldquo;Oh, surely not. Surely Jepcott would not deceive us; I can&rsquo;t  think that of her. The very last words I said to her were, &lsquo;Jepcott, do you feel  at all sleepy? If you feel in the least degree sleepy, have the housemaid to sit  with you&mdash;make assurance doubly sure, and have the housemaid!&rsquo; &lsquo;No, Miss,&rsquo; Jepcott  said, &lsquo;I never felt more wakeful in my life, and as to the girl, she&rsquo;s a poor, frightened  silly, and I don&rsquo;t think you could induce her to go into master&rsquo;s room, though you  were to offer her a five-pound note for doing it.&rsquo; And if Jepcott went to sleep  after this, knowing that everything was left about just as it was when my uncle  died, it was really too bad of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send  for Mrs. Jepcott,&rdquo; said Launcelot Darrell; &ldquo;let us hear what she has to say about  this very probable story of my stealing my great-uncle&rsquo;s keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Lavinia de Crespigny rang the bell, which was answered by Mr. Parker, who, though  usually slow to respond to any summons, was wonderfully prompt in his attendance  this evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  Mrs. Jepcott to come here,&rdquo; said Miss Lavinia, &ldquo;I want to speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  butler departed upon this errand, and again there was a silent pause, which seemed  a very long one, but which only extended over five minutes. At the end of that time  Mrs. Jepcott appeared. She was a respectable-looking woman, prim, and rather grim  in appearance. She had been in the dead man&rsquo;s service for five-and-thirty years,  and was about fifteen years older than the Misses de Crespigny, whom she always  spoke of as &ldquo;the young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jepcott,&rdquo;  said Miss Sarah, &ldquo;I want to know whether anybody whatever, except yourself, has  entered Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s room since you have been placed in charge of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear, no, miss,&rdquo; answered the housekeeper, promptly, &ldquo;certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  you sure of that, Jepcott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite  sure, miss, as sure as I am that I am standing here this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  speak very confidently, Jepcott, but this is really a most serious business. I am  told that you have been asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep,  Miss de Crespigny! Oh, dear, who <em>could</em> say anything of the kind? Who could  be so wicked as to tell such a story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are certain that you have not been asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  miss, quite certain. I closed my eye sometimes, for my sight is weak, as you know,  miss, and the light dazzled me, and made my eyes ache. I close my eyes generally  when I sit down of an evening, for my sight doesn&rsquo;t allow me to do needlework by  candlelight, neither to read a newspaper; and I may have closed my eyes to-night,  but I didn&rsquo;t go to <em>sleep</em>, miss, oh dear no; I was too nervous and anxious  for that, a great deal; besides, I am not a good sleeper at any time, and so I should  have heard if a mouse had stirred in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t hear me come into the room, did you, Mrs. Jepcott?&rdquo; asked Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em>,  Mr. Darrell? Oh, dear, no; neither you nor anybody else, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you don&rsquo;t think that I could have come into the room without your knowing it? You  don&rsquo;t think I could have come in while you were asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> asleep, Mr. Darrell; and as for you or anybody comin&rsquo; in without  my hearin&rsquo; &rsquo;em&mdash;why, I heard every leaf that stirred outside the windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear  that at least this part of your charge must drop to the ground, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo;  Launcelot Darrell said, scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jepcott,&rdquo;  said Miss Lavinia de Crespigny, &ldquo;go back and see if my uncle&rsquo;s keys are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  do, Mrs. Jepcott,&rdquo; explained Launcelot Darrell; &ldquo;and be sure you take notice whether  they have been disturbed since your master died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  housekeeper left the room, and returned after about three minutes&rsquo; absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  keys are quite safe, Miss Lavinia,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  they have not been disturbed?&rdquo; asked Launcelot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Darrell, they haven&rsquo;t been moved a quarter of an inch. They&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo; just where  they lay when my poor master died, half hid under a pocket-handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell drew a long breath. How wonderfully these foolish women had played into  his hands, and helped him to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  will do, Jepcott,&rdquo; said Miss Sarah, &ldquo;you may go now. Remember that you are responsible  for everything in my uncle&rsquo;s room until the arrival of Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s clerk. It would  have been a very bad business for you if Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s keys had been tampered  with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Jepcott looked rather alarmed at this remark, and retired without delay. Suppose  she had been asleep, after all, for five minutes or so, and some mischief had arisen  out of it, what might not her punishment be. She had a very vague idea of the power  of the law, and did not know what penalties she might have incurred by five minutes&rsquo;  unconscious doze. This honest woman had been in the habit of spending the evening  in a series of intermittent naps for the last ten years, and had no idea that while  closing her eyes to shade them from the glare of the light, she often slumbered  soundly for an hour at a stretch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; Launcelot Darrell said, when the housekeeper had left the room,  &ldquo;I suppose now you are convinced that all this mid-winter night&rsquo;s dream is a mere  hallucination of your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked at him with a contemptuous smile whose open scorn was not the least painful  torture he had been obliged to bear that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  not speak to me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;remember who I am; and let that memory keep you silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  door-bell rang loudly as Eleanor finished speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss de Crespigny, &ldquo;Mr. Lawford&rsquo;s clerk has come at last. He  will take charge of everything, and <em>if</em> anybody has tampered with my uncle&rsquo;s  papers,&rdquo; she added, looking first at Launcelot and then at Eleanor, &ldquo;I have no doubt  that he will find out all about it. We are poor unprotected women, but I dare say  we shall find those who will be able to defend our rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think we have any occasion to stop here,&rdquo; said Mr. Monckton; &ldquo;are you ready to come  home, Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite  ready,&rdquo; his wife answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have nothing more to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put  on your cloak, then, and come. Goodnight, Miss de Crespigny. Good-night, Miss Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Lamb, the Windsor  solicitor&rsquo;s clerk, came in while Gilbert Monckton and his wife were leaving the  room. He was the same old man whom Richard Thornton had seen at Windsor. Eleanor perceived  that this man was surprised to see Launcelot Darrell. He started, and looked at  the artist with a half-frightened, half-inquiring glance; but the young man did  not return the look.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter46"></a>Chapter 46<br>
  Laura&rsquo;s Troubles</strong></h2>
<p>Gilbert Monckton offered Eleanor his arm as they went out of the hall and  down the steps before the front entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would  have got a conveyance for you if it had been possible, Eleanor,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but of  course at this time of night that is utterly out of the question. Do you think that  you can manage the walk home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; very well indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  sighed as she spoke. She felt completely baffled by what had occurred, terribly  prostrated by the defeat which had befallen her. There was no hope, then. This base  and treacherous man was always to triumph: however wicked, however criminal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  it very late?&rdquo; she asked, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  very late&mdash;past one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  husband and wife walked homewards in silence. The road seemed even drearier than  before to Eleanor, though this time she had a companion in her dismal journey. But  this time despair was gnawing at her breast; she had been supported before by excitement,  buoyed up by hope.</p>
<p>They  reached Tolldale at last. The butler admitted them. He had sent all the other servants  to bed, and had sat up alone to receive his master. Even upon this night of bewilderment  Gilbert Monckton endeavoured to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  have been to Woodlands,&rdquo; he said to the old servant. &ldquo;Mr. de Crespigny is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had  no doubt that his own and his wife&rsquo;s absence had given rise to wonderment in the  quiet household, and he thought by this means to set all curiosity at rest. But  the drawing-room door opened while he was speaking, and Laura rushed into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  my goodness gracious,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;here you are at last. What I have suffered  this evening! Oh! what agonies I have suffered this evening, wondering what had  happened, and thinking of all sorts of horrid things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  my dear Laura, why didn&rsquo;t you go to bed?&rdquo; asked Mr. Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Go  to bed!</em>&rdquo; screamed the young lady. &ldquo;Go to bed with my poor brain bursting with  suspense. I&rsquo;m sure if people&rsquo;s brains <em>do</em> burst, it&rsquo;s a wonder mine hasn&rsquo;t  to-night, and I thought ever so many times it was going to do it. First Eleanor  goes out without leaving word where <em>she&rsquo;s</em> gone; and then you go out without  leaving word where <em>you&rsquo;re</em> gone; and then you both stay away for hours, and  hours, and hours. And there I sit all the time watching the clock, with nobody but  the Skye to keep my company, until I get so nervous, that I daren&rsquo;t look behind  me, and I almost begin to feel as if the Skye was a demon dog! And, oh, do tell  me what in goodness&rsquo; name has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  into the drawing-room, Laura; and pray don&rsquo;t talk so fast. I will tell you presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton walked into the drawing-room followed by Laura and his wife. He closed  the door carefully, and then sat himself down by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  had coals put on five times,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Mason, &ldquo;but all the coals in the world  wouldn&rsquo;t keep me from shivering and feeling as if somebody was coming in through  the door and looking over my shoulder. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the Skye I should have  gone mad. What <em>has</em> happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something  has happened at Woodlands&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Monckton began gravely, but Laura interrupted him  with a little shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t, please; I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t. I know what you&rsquo;re going  to say. You must come and sleep with me to-night, Eleanor, if you don&rsquo;t want to  find me raving mad in the morning. No wonder I felt as if the room was peopled with  ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be foolish, Laura,&rdquo; Mr. Monckton said, impatiently. &ldquo;You asked me what has happened,  and I tell you. To speak plain, Mr. de Crespigny is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I guessed that, of course, directly you began to speak in that solemn way. It&rsquo;s  very dreadful&mdash;not that he should be dead, you know, because I scarcely ever saw  him, and when I did see him, he always seemed to be deaf, or grumpy&mdash;but it seems  dreadful that people should die at all, and I always fancy they&rsquo;ll come walking  into the room at night when I&rsquo;m taking my hair down before the glass, and look over  my shoulder, as they do in German stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  please don&rsquo;t look contemptuously at me,&rdquo; cried Miss Mason, piteously; &ldquo;of course,  if you haven&rsquo;t got nerves it&rsquo;s very easy to despise these things; and I wish <em>I&rsquo;d</em> been born a man or a lawyer, or something of that sort, so that I might never be  nervous. Not that I believe in ghosts, you know; I&rsquo;m not so childish as that. I  don&rsquo;t believe in them, and I&rsquo;m not afraid of them, but <em>I don&rsquo;t like them!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton&rsquo;s contemptuous expression changed to a look of pity. This was the foolish  girl whom he had been about to entrust to the man he now knew to be a villain. He <em>now</em> knew:&mdash;bah, he had paltered with his own conscience. He had known it from  the first: and this poor child loved Launcelot Darrell. Her hopes, like his own,  were shipwrecked; and even in the egotism of his misery the strong man felt some  compassion for this helpless girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,  Mr. de Crespigny is dead,&rdquo; Laura said after a pause; &ldquo;does Launcelot know it yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was  he there to-night&mdash;up at Woodlands, in spite of his nasty old aunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  he was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked anxiously, almost piteously at Laura. The great disappointment, the death-blow  of every hope, was coming down upon her, and Eleanor, who could see the hand uplifted  to strike, and the cruel knife bared ready to inflict the fatal stab, shivered as  she thought of the misery the thoughtless girl must have to suffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  what can her misery be against my father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and how am <em>I</em> accountable  for her sorrow. It is all Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s work, it is his wicked work from first  to last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  do you think he will have the fortune?&rdquo; Laura asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know, my dear,&rdquo; her guardian answered gravely, &ldquo;but I think it matters very little  either to you or me whether he may get the fortune or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;how strangely you speak; how cruelly and coldly you  speak of Launcelot, just as if you didn&rsquo;t care whether he was rich or poor. Oh,  good heavens,&rdquo; she shrieked, suddenly growing wild with terror, &ldquo;why do you both  look at me like that? Why do you both look so anxious? I know that something dreadful  has happened; something has happened to Launcelot! It&rsquo;s not Mr. de Crespigny, it&rsquo;s  Launcelot that&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no, Laura, he is not dead. It would be better perhaps if he were. He is not a good  man, Laura, and he can never be your husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t care a bit about his not being good, as long as he isn&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; exclaimed  Laura. &ldquo;I never said he was good, and never wanted him to be good. <em>I&rsquo;m</em> not  good; for I don&rsquo;t like going to church three times every Sunday. The idea of your  saying my poor dear Launcelot musn&rsquo;t marry me because he isn&rsquo;t good. I like him  to be a little wicked, like the Giaour, or Manfred&mdash;though goodness gracious only  knows what <em>he&rsquo;d</em> done that he should go on as he did&mdash;I never asked him to  be good. Goodness wouldn&rsquo;t go well with his style of looks. It&rsquo;s fair people, with  wishy-washy blue eyes and straight hair, and no eyebrows or eyelashes in particular,  that are generally good. I hate <em>good</em> people, and if you don&rsquo;t let me marry  Launcelot Darrell now, I shall marry him when I&rsquo;m of age, and that&rsquo;ll be in three  years&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason said all this with great vehemence and indignation, and then walked towards  the door of the room; but Eleanor stopped her, and caught the slender little figure  in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!  Laura, Laura,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you must listen to us, you must hear us, my poor darling.  I know it seems very cruel to speak against the man you love, but it would be fifty  times more cruel to let you marry him, and leave you to discover afterwards, when  your life was linked to his, and never, never could be a happy life again if parted  from him, that he was unworthy of your love. It is terrible to be told this now,  Laura, it would be a thousand times more terrible to hear it then. Come with me  to your room, Laura, I will stay with you all to-night. I will tell you all I know  about Launcelot Darrell. I ought to have told you before, perhaps, but I waited;  I waited for what I begin to think will never come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t  believe anything against him,&rdquo; cried Laura, passionately, disengaging herself from  Eleanor&rsquo;s embrace; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t listen to you. I won&rsquo;t hear a word. <em>I</em> know why  you don&rsquo;t want me to marry him: you were in love with him yourself, you know you  were, and you&rsquo;re jealous of me, and you want to prevent my being happy with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all  the unlucky speeches that could have been made in the presence of Gilbert Monckton,  this was perhaps the most unlucky. He started as if he had been stung, and rising  from his seat near the fire, took a lighted candle from a side table, and walked  to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really  can&rsquo;t endure all this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Eleanor, I&rsquo;ll leave you with Laura. Say what you  have to say about Launcelot Darrell, and for pity&rsquo;s sake let me never hear his name  again. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two girls were left alone together. Laura had thrown herself upon a sofa, and was  sobbing violently. Eleanor stood a few paces from her, looking at her with the same  tender and compassionate expression with which she had regarded her from the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  I see your troubles, Laura,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I almost forget my own. My poor dear child,  God knows how truly I pity you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t want your pity,&rdquo; cried Laura. &ldquo;I shall hate you if you say anything against  Launcelot. Why should anybody pity me? I am engaged to the man I love, the only  man I ever loved,&mdash;you know that, Eleanor; you know how I fell in love with him directly  he came to Hazlewood,&mdash;and I will marry him in spite of all the world. I shall be  of age in three years, and then no horrid guardians can prevent my doing what I  like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you would not marry him, Laura, if you knew him to be a bad man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would  never believe that he is a bad man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  my darling, you will listen to me. I must tell you the truth. I have kept it from  you too long. I have been very guilty in keeping it from you. I ought to have told  you when I first came back to Tolldale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What</em> ought you to have told me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  story of my life, Laura. But I thought you would come between me and the victory  I wanted to achieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  victory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A victory  over the man who caused my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then,  little by little, interrupted by a hundred exclamations and protestations from the  sobbing girl whose head lay on her shoulder, and whose waist was encircled by her  arm, Eleanor Monckton told the story of her return to Paris, the meeting on the  Boulevard, and George Vane&rsquo;s suicide. Little by little she contrived to explain  to the wretched girl, who clung about her, and who declared again and again that  she <em>would</em> not believe anything against Launcelot, that she could not think  him cruel or treacherous,&mdash;how the artist and his vile associate, Victor Bourdon,  had cheated the old man out of the money which represented his own honour and the  future welfare of his child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  think me hard and merciless, Laura,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and I sometimes wonder at my own  feelings; but remember, only remember what my father suffered. He was cheated out  of the money that had been entrusted to him. He was afraid to face his own child.  Oh, my poor dear, how could you wrong me so cruelly,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;how could  you think that I should have spoken one word of reproach, or loved you any the less,  if you had lost a dozen fortunes of mine? No, Laura, I <em>cannot</em> forget what  my father suffered, I <em>cannot</em> be merciful to this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  task was a very hard one. Laura would not believe, or she would not acknowledge  that she believed; though she had none of the calm assurance which a perfect and  entire faith in her lover should have given her. It was useless to reason with her.  All Eleanor&rsquo;s logic was powerless against the passionate force of this girl&rsquo;s perpetual  cry, the gist of which was &ldquo;I will believe no harm of him! I love him, and I will  not cease to love him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  would not argue, or listen to Eleanor&rsquo;s calm reasoning; for Mrs. Monckton was very  calm in the knowledge of her own defeat, almost despairingly resigned, in the idea  that all struggle against Launcelot Darrell was hopeless. Laura would not listen,  would not be convinced. The man whom Eleanor had seen in Paris was not Launcelot. He was in India at that very  time. He had written letters from India, and posted them thence, with  foreign postage stamps. The shipbroker&rsquo;s books were all wrong; what was more likely  than that stupid shipbrokers&rsquo; clerks should make wrong entries in their horrid books?  In short, according to poor Laura&rsquo;s reasoning, Launcelot Darrell was the victim  of a series of coincidences. There had happened to be a person who resembled him  in Paris at the  time of George Vane&rsquo;s death. There had happened to be a mistake in the shipbroker&rsquo;s  books. The figure in the water-coloured sketch that Eleanor had stolen happened  to be like the old man. Miss Mason rejected circumstantial evidence in toto. As  for the story of the forgery, she delared that it was all a fabrication of Eleanor&rsquo;s,  invented in order that the marriage should be postponed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  very cruel, Eleanor,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve acted very treacherously, and I shouldn&rsquo;t  have thought it of you. First you fall in love with Launcelot Darrell; and then  you go and marry my guardian; and then, when you find that you don&rsquo;t like my guardian,  you begrudge me my happiness; and you now want to set me against Launcelot; but  I will not be set against him. There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  last decisive monosyllable was uttered amidst a torrent of sobs, and then, for a  long time, the two girls sat in silence upon the sofa before the expiring fire.  By and by, Laura nestled her head a little closer upon Eleanor&rsquo;s shoulder; then  a little hand, very cold, by reason of its owner&rsquo;s agitation, stole into the open  palm lying idle upon Mrs. Monckton&rsquo;s lap; and at last, in a low voice, almost stifled  by tears, she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Do</em> you think that he is wicked? Oh! Eleanor, do you <em>really</em> think that it was  he who cheated your poor old father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  that it was he, Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  do you believe that he has made a false will, for the sake of that dreadful money?  Oh, how could he care for the money, when we might have been so happy together poor!  Do you <em>really</em> believe that he has committed&mdash;forgery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  dropped her voice to a whisper as she spoke the word that was so awful to her when  uttered in relation to Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe  it, and I know it, Laura,&rdquo; Eleanor answered, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  what will they do to him? What will become of him? They won&rsquo;t hang him&mdash;will they,  Eleanor? They don&rsquo;t hang people for forgery now. Oh, Eleanor, what will become of  him? I love him so dearly, I don&rsquo;t care what he is, or what he has done. I love  him still, and would die to save him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  need not be afraid, Laura,&rdquo; Mrs. Monckton answered, rather bitterly. &ldquo;Launcelot  Darrell will escape all evil consequences of what he has done. You may be sure of  that. He will hold his head higher than he ever held it yet, Laura. He will be master  of Woodlands before next week is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  his conscience, Eleanor, his conscience! He will be so unhappy&mdash;he will be so miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura  disengaged herself from the loving arm that had supported her, and started to her  feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;where is he? Let me go to him! It is not too late to undo all this,  perhaps. He can put back the real will, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  the real will is lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  can destroy the false one, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think he will have the chance of doing that, Laura. If his heart is not hardened  against remorse, he will have plenty of time for repentance between this and the  time when the will is read. If he wishes to undo what he has done, he may make a  confession to his aunts, and throw himself upon their mercy. They are the only persons  likely to be injured by what he has done. The money was left to them in the original  will, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <em>shall</em> confess, Eleanor!&rdquo; cried Laura. &ldquo;I will throw myself upon my knees  at his feet, and I won&rsquo;t leave him till he promises me to undo what he has done.  His aunts will keep the secret, for their own sakes. They wouldn&rsquo;t like the world  to know that their nephew could do such a wicked thing. He shall confess to them,  and let them have the fortune, and then we can be married, and then we shall be  as happy together as if he had never done wrong. Let me go to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  to-night, Laura. Look at the clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  pointed to the dial of the timepiece opposite them. It was half-past two o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  see him to-morrow morning, then, Eleanor. I <em>will</em> see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  shall, my dear; if you think it wise or right to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Laura Mason did not see her lover the next morning; for when the morning came, she  was in a burning fever, brought on by the agitation and excitement of the previous  night. A medical man was summoned from Windsor  to attend upon her, and Eleanor sat by her bed-side, watching her as tenderly as  a mother watches her sick child.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton too was very anxious about his ward, and came up to the door of Laura&rsquo;s  room to make inquiries many times in the course of that day.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter47"></a>Chapter 47<br>
  Getting Over It</strong></h2>
<p>Laura  Mason was not dangerously ill. Her malady was by no means of a serious nature. The  pink-blossom tint of her cheeks was intensified into vivid carnation; the turquoise-blue  eyes shone with a feverish light; the little hands were very hot and dry. It was  in vain that the physician from Windsor  prescribed composing draughts. His patient would not be quiet or composed. In vain  Eleanor tried to soothe the wounded spirit. It would not be at rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  no use, Nelly,&rdquo; the invalid cried, impatiently, &ldquo;I must talk of him; I must talk  of my sorrows, unless you want me to go mad. Oh, my poor Launcelot! my own dear  Launcelot! how cruel it is to keep me from you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was the worst part of the business. Poor Laura was perpetually entreating to be  allowed to see Launcelot. Would they let her go to him; or would they send and ask  him to come to her? They were the most cruel and heartless creatures if they could  refuse to let her see him.</p>
<p>But  Eleanor did refuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is impossible, my darling,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I cannot send for him. It is quite impossible  that he and I should ever meet again, except as enemies. The will must be read in  a few days. Let us wait till then. If Launcelot Darrell is sorry for what he has  done, he will try to undo it. If he is not sorry, and takes possession of the estate  upon the strength of a forged will, he must be a villain, unworthy even of your  pity, Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I <em>do</em> pity him; and I love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  strange to see what a hold this unhappy affection had taken upon Laura&rsquo;s shallow  nature. This frivolous girl was as impressionable as she was volatile. The blow  was more terrible to her than it would have been to a woman of higher and grander  nature; but to such a woman the consequences of the blow would be, perhaps, lifelong,  while it was scarcely likely that Laura would suffer for ever. She did not try to  endure the grief that had fallen upon her. She was entirely without pride; and had  no more shame in bemoaning her loss of Launcelot Darrell, than she would have had  fifteen years before in crying over a broken doll. She did not care who knew her  sorrows, and would have made a confidante of the servant who waited upon her, if  Eleanor had not interfered to prevent her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  very miserable and wretched, Jane,&rdquo; she said, while the girl was smoothing her pillows  and arranging the tumbled bed-clothes, which had been twisted into mere wisps of  linen by the perpetual tossings to and fro of the invalid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the most miserable  creature that ever was born, Jane, and I wish that I was dead. I know it&rsquo;s wicked,  but I do. What&rsquo;s the good of Dr. Featherstone prescribing for me, when I don&rsquo;t want  to be prescribed for? What&rsquo;s the good of my taking lime-draughts, when I&rsquo;d much  rather die? What&rsquo;s the use of those horrid opiates, that taste like stale London porter? Opiates won&rsquo;t  give me back Launce&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  stopped abruptly at this point, checked by a warning look from Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must not speak of Launcelot Darrell to these people, Laura,&rdquo; Mrs. Monckton said,  when the servant had left the room, &ldquo;unless you want them to suspect that something  strange has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  they&rsquo;ll know it, if my wedding is put off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  guardian will explain all that, Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason bemoaned her fate even more piteously than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  hard enough to be miserable,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s still worse to be miserable,  and not to be allowed to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many  people have sorrows to endure that cannot be spoken of,&rdquo; Eleanor answered, quietly.  &ldquo;I had to bear the sorrow of my father&rsquo;s death when I dared not speak of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton saw very little of her husband during the few days of Laura&rsquo;s illness.  She only saw him, indeed, when he came to the door to make inquiries about his ward;  but even in the few brief sentences exchanged by them, she could perceive that he  was altered towards her. He had been cold and distant for a long time since their  marriage; but now his manner had the icy reserve of a man who feels that he has  been wronged. Eleanor comprehended this, and was sorry for it; but she had a dull,  hopeless feeling that nothing she could do would alter it. The great purpose of  her life had failed; and she began to think that nothing but failure could come  to any hope of hers.</p>
<p>This  feeling separated her completely from her husband. In her ignorance of the suspicions  which tortured him, she could of course make no effort to set him right. The girl&rsquo;s  innocence and the man&rsquo;s pride made a gulf that no power of affection could pass.  If Eleanor could have guessed, ever so vaguely, at the cause of her husband&rsquo;s reserve,  a few words from her might have melted the ice: but she had not the faintest notion  of the hidden source from which came those bitter waters that had swept away all  outward tokens of her husband&rsquo;s love; and those words remained unspoken. Gilbert  Monckton thought that if his wife was not false, she was at least indifferent; and  he bowed his head before the gloomy face of his Destiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  not to be loved,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good-bye, once more, to that dream. And let me try to  do my duty, and be in some way useful to my fellow creatures. Half my life has been  swallowed up by egotistical regrets. May God give me grace to use the remnant of  it more wisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had  told Eleanor that as soon as Laura was a little better he should take her to the  seaside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  poor child cannot remain here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every gossip in the neighbourhood will  be eager to know why the wedding is postponed; and unless we assign some simple  reason for the change in our arrangements, there will be no limit to people&rsquo;s speculations  and conjectures. Laura&rsquo;s illness will be the best possible excuse; and I will take  her to the south of France.  She may forget Launcelot Darrell by-and-by, when she finds herself in a strange  place, surrounded by new associations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  eagerly assented to this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing  could be wiser than such an arrangement,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I almost think the poor  girl would die if she remained here. Everything reminds her of her disappointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, I shall take her to Nice as soon as she is well enough to go. Will you  tell her that I mean to do so, and try and make her feel some interest in the idea  of the change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton had a very hard time of it in the sick room. Those frivolous people who  feel their misfortunes very acutely for the time being, are apt to throw a heavy  share of their burden upon the shoulders of their friends. Laura&rsquo;s lamentations  were very painful and not a little monotonous to hear; and there was a great deal  of hard work to be done in the way of going over the same ground again and again,  for that young lady&rsquo;s consolation. She had no idea of turning her face to the wall  and suffering in silence. Her manner had none of that artificial calm which often  causes uneasiness to those who watch a beloved sufferer through some terrible crisis.  Everything reminded her of her grief; and she would not be courageous enough to  put away the things that recalled her sorrows. She could not draw a curtain over  the bright picture of the past, and turn her face resolutely to the blank future.  She was for ever looking back, and bewailing the beauty of that vanished hope, and  insisting that the dream palace was not utterly ruined; that it might be patched  up again somehow or other, not to be what it was before, that was impossible, of  course; but to be <em>something</em>. The broken vase could surely be pieced together,  and the scent of the faded roses would hang round it still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  he repents, I will marry him, Eleanor,&rdquo; she said, at the end of almost every argument,  &ldquo;and we will go to Italy  and be happy together, and he will be a great painter. Nobody would dare to say  he had committed a forgery if he was a great painter like Holman Hunt, or Mr. Millais.  We&rsquo;ll go to Rome together, Nelly, and he shall study the old masters, and sketch  peasants from the life; and I won&rsquo;t mind even if they&rsquo;re pretty, though it isn&rsquo;t  pleasant to have one&rsquo;s husband always sketching pretty peasants; and that will divert  his mind, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  four days Laura was ordered to keep to her bed, and during that time Eleanor rarely  quitted the invalid&rsquo;s apartments, only taking brief snatches of rest in an easy  chair by the fire in Laura&rsquo;s dressing-room. On the fifth day Miss Mason was allowed  to get up, and then there were terrible scenes to be gone through; for the young  lady insisted upon having her trousseau spread out upon the bed, and the chairs,  and the sofas, and hung upon every available peg in the two rooms; until both those  apartments became a very forest of finery, about which the invalid prowled perpetually,  indulging in a separate fit of weeping over every garment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  at this darling parasol, Nelly,&rdquo; she cried, gazing at the tiny canopy of silk and  whalebone with streaming eyes; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t the real point lace over the pale pink silk  lovely? And then it&rsquo;s so becoming to the complexion, too! Oh, how happy I thought  I should be when I had this parasol. I thought I should drive on the Corso with  Launcelot, and <em>now</em>&mdash;&mdash;! And the violet-satin boots with high heels,  Nelly, made on purpose to wear with my violet-silk dress, I thought nobody <em>could</em> be unhappy with such things as those, and <em>now</em>&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every  speech ended in fresh tears, which sometimes trickled over a shining silken garment,  and flecked the lustrous fabric with spots of water that took the brightness out  of the splendid hues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  think that I should be so miserable as to cry over silk at nine and sixpence a yard,  and not to care!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura Mason; as if, in these words, she described the  highest anguish-point that human misery can reach.</p>
<p>She  had a few presents given her by Launcelot, they were <em>very</em> few, and by no  means valuable, for Mr. Darrell, as we know, was essentially selfish, and did not  care to spend his small stock of money upon other people; and she sat with these  trifles in her lap for hours together, lamenting over them, and talking about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  my silver thimble, my dear, darling little silver thimble,&rdquo; she said, perching the  scrap of glistening metal upon her little finger, and kissing it with that degree  of rapture which the French vaudeville-ists call &ldquo;explosion!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that nasty, spiteful  Amelia Shalders said a silver thimble was a vulgar present, just what a carpenter,  or any other common man, would have given to his sweetheart, and that Launcelot  ought to have given me a ring or a bracelet, as if he could go buying rings and  bracelets without any money. And I don&rsquo;t care whether my thimble&rsquo;s vulgar or not,  and I love it dearly, because he gave it me. And I&rsquo;d do lots of needlework for the  sake of using it, only I never could learn to use a thimble&mdash;quite. It always seems  so much easier to work without one, though it does make a hole in the top of one&rsquo;s  finger. Then there&rsquo;s my tablets! Nobody can say that ivory tablets are vulgar. My  darling little tablets, with the tiny, <em>tiny</em> gold pencil-case,&rdquo;&mdash;the gold pencil-case  was <em>very</em> tiny,&mdash;&ldquo;and the wee mite of a turquoise for a seal. I&rsquo;ve tried to  write &lsquo;Launcelot&rsquo; upon every leaf, but I don&rsquo;t think ivory tablets are the very  nicest things to write upon. One&rsquo;s writing seems to slide about somehow as if the  pencil was tipsy; and the lines won&rsquo;t come straight. It&rsquo;s like trying to walk up  and down the deck of a steamer, one goes where one doesn&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  bewailings over the trousseau and the presents had a beneficial effect upon the  heart-broken invalid. On the evening of the fifth day her spirits began to revive  a little, she drank tea with Eleanor at a table by the fire in the dressing-room,  and after tea tried on her wedding bonnet and mantle before the cheval glass.</p>
<p>This  performance seemed to have a peculiarly consoling effect, and after surveying herself  for a long time in the glass, and lamenting the redness of her eyelids, which prevented  full justice being done to the beauty of the bonnet, Miss Mason declared that she  felt a great deal better, and that she had a presentiment that something would happen,  and that everything would come right somehow or other.</p>
<p>As it  would have been very cruel to deprive her of this rather vague species of comfort,  Eleanor said nothing, and the evening ended almost cheerfully. But the next day  was that appointed for Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s funeral and the reading of the will; and  Laura&rsquo;s anxiety was now really greater than it had ever been. She could not help  believing Eleanor&rsquo;s story of the forgery, though she had struggled long against  the conviction that had been forced upon her, and her only hope was that her lover  would repent, and suffer his aunts to inherit the wealth which had been no doubt  bequeathed to them. Frivolous and shallow as this girl was, she could not for a  moment contemplate marrying Launcelot under any other circumstances. She could not  think of sharing with him a fortune that had been gained by fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  he will confess the truth,&rdquo; she said to Eleanor, upon the morning of the funeral,  &ldquo;he was led into doing wrong by his friend, that wicked Frenchman. It was only the  impulse of the moment. He has been sorry ever since, I dare say. He will undo what  he has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  if the real will has been destroyed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  his two aunts and his mother would share the estate between them. We were both mistaken,  you know, Eleanor, in thinking that Launcelot would be heir-at-law if his great-uncle  died without a will. My guardian told me so the other day when I asked him some  question about the fortune. And he told Launcelot the same thing that night in the  library, when they had the conversation about my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Laura  was anxious upon this eventful day, Eleanor was anxious too. It was a new crisis  in her life. Would Launcelot Darrell attempt to restore himself to the position  he had occupied before the night of his uncle&rsquo;s death, or would he hold to that  which he might acquire by his deliberate fraud, and remain a hardened and impenitent  criminal, defiant of the law he had outraged?</p>

  The Reading Of The Will</strong></h2>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton went up to Tolldale immediately after the funeral, in order to be present  at the reading of the will. He felt that he had a right to see the end of this business,  in which his wife had played so extraordinary a part. The will was to be read by  Henry Lawford&rsquo;s clerk, in the sitting-room, or study, which Maurice de Crespigny  had occupied for many years before his death.</p>
<p>There  were a great many people who, like Gilbert Monckton, thought they had a right to  be present upon this occasion; people who had been kept out of the old man&rsquo;s house  by the rigid watchfulness and the inflexible will of the two maiden ladies for the  last twenty years or so, but who were freely admitted now, as no longer capable  of doing mischief. All manner of distant relationships, so remote as to be almost  untraceable, came to light upon this occasion: cousins, by marriage; sisters-in-law  of dead first cousins, once removed; widowers, who attached themselves to the house  of Crespigny by right of departed wives; widows who declared themselves near relations  on the strength of claims held by defunct husbands; poor connections who came on  foot, and who were so poor that it was really an impertinence in them to expect  the smallest legacy; rich connections who came in splendid carriages, and who seemed  even more eager for any stray twenty pounds for a mourning ring, that might be set  against their names, than the poorest of the brotherhood. And indeed these owners  of splendid carriages might have been needier than the dusty and weatherbeaten pedestrians;  for when people try to make fifteen hundred a-year do the work of three thousand,  every accidental twenty pounds is a God-send to them.</p>
<p>However  it might be, everybody in the Woodlands drawing-room upon that particular morning  was influenced by the same feeling, a compound sensation of hope and distrust, expectancy  and despair. Surely there could never before have been so many eager faces assembled  together in the same small space. Every face, young or old, handsome or ugly, aristocratic  or plebeian, wore the same expression; and had thus a common likeness, which bore  out the idea of some tie of relationship binding the whole assembly.</p>
<p>Every  one regarded his or her neighbour as the possible inheritor of something worth having,  and therefore a personal enemy. Smiling relations were suspected of being acquainted  with the contents of the will, and secretly rejoicing in the certainty of their  own names being pleasantly mentioned therein. Frowning relations were looked at  darkly as probable arch-plotters who had worked upon the mind of the dead man. Diffident  relations were feared as toadies and sycophants, who had no doubt plied Mr. de Crespigny  with artful flatteries. Confident relations were dreaded as people who perhaps had  some secret claim upon the estate, and were silently gloating over the excellence  of their chances. Every one of these outsiders hated each other with vengeful and  murderous hate; but they all sympathised in a far deeper hatred of the four favourites  for these great legacy stakes, the two maiden ladies, Mrs. Darrell, and her son.  It was almost certain that one or other of these four people would inherit the Woodlands  property, and the bulk of the dead man&rsquo;s fortune; unless, indeed, by one of those  caprices common to eccentric valetudinarians; he should have left his wealth to  some distant connexion, who had been too proud to toady him&mdash;and had moreover never  had the chance of doing so. Yes, the three nieces and Launcelot were the first favourites  in this eager race; and the outsiders speculated freely amongst themselves as to  the chances and the &ldquo;condition&rdquo; of these four fortunate creatures. And if the outsiders  hated each other desperately for the sake of very small chances, how much more desperate  must have been the feelings of these four who were to enter for the great stake.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell met Mr. Monckton this morning for the first time since that strange scene  upon the night of Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s death. The young man had called at Tolldale  Priory during the interval, but both the lawyer and his ward had been denied to  him.</p>
<p>Perhaps  amongst all those assembled in the chamber which had so lately been tenanted by  the dead man, there was not one more painfully anxious than Gilbert Monckton, into  whose mind no mercenary thought had ever entered.</p>
<p>It was  in the hope of seeing his wife justified that Mr. Monckton had come to Woodlands  upon this day. He had brooded over Eleanor&rsquo;s denunciation of Launcelot Darrell perpetually  during the week that had elapsed since the old man&rsquo;s death; but the more he pondered  upon that passionate accusation the more bewildered and perplexed he became.</p>
<p>Let  it be remembered that he was a man whose nature had been rendered jealous and suspicious  by one cruel deception which had embittered his youth and soured a generous disposition.  His mind was penetrated with the idea that Eleanor had never loved him, and that  she <em>had</em> loved Launcelot Darrell. This belief was the tormenting spirit, the  insidious demon which had held possession of his breast ever since his brief honey-moon  on the northern coast. He could not dismiss it all in a moment. The fiend was in  possession, and was not very easily to be exorcised. That vehement denunciation,  that passionate accusation which had rushed, impetuous and angry, from Eleanor Monckton&rsquo;s  lips, might be the outburst of a jealous woman&rsquo;s fury, and might have its root in  love. Eleanor had loved this young man, and was indignant against him for his intended  marriage with Laura. If the desire to avenge her father&rsquo;s death had alone actuated  her, surely this passionate girl would have spoken before now.</p>
<p>It was  thus that Gilbert Monckton argued. He did not know how eager Eleanor had been to  speak, and how she had only been held back by the worldly wisdom of Richard Thornton.  How should he know the long trial of patience, the bitter struggle between the promptings  of passion and the cold arguments of policy which his wife had endured? He knew  nothing except that something&mdash;some secret&mdash;some master passion&mdash;had absorbed her soul,  and separated her from him.</p>
<p>He stood  aloof in the dead man&rsquo;s study while Mr. Lamb, the clerk, a grey-haired old man,  with a nervous manner and downcast eyes, arranged his papers upon a little table  near the fire and cleared his throat preparatory to commencing the reading of the  will.</p>
<p>There  was an awful silence in the room, as if everybody&rsquo;s natural respiration had been  suspended all in a moment, and then the clerk&rsquo;s low voice began very slowly and  hesitatingly with the usual formula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,  Maurice de Crespigny, being at this time,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c. The will was of some  length, and as it began with a great many insignificant legacies, mourning rings,  snuff-boxes, books, antique plate, scraps of valuable china, and small donations  of all kinds to distant relations and friends who had been lost sight of on the  lonely pathway along which the old man had crawled to his tomb under the grim guardianship  of his two warders&mdash;the patience of the chief expectants was very sorely tried. But  at last, after modest little annuities to the servants had been mentioned, the important  clauses were arrived at.</p>
<p>To every  one of the three sisters, Sarah and Lavinia de Crespigny and Ellen Darrell, the  testator bequeathed money in the funds to the amount of two hundred a-year. All  the &ldquo;rest and residue&rdquo; of his estate, real and personal, was left to Launcelot Darrell,  &ldquo;absolutely,&rdquo; without condition or reserve.</p>
<p>The  blood rushed up to the widow&rsquo;s face, and then as suddenly receded, leaving it ghastly  white. She held out her hand to her son who stood beside her chair, and clasped  his clammy fingers in her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  God,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;you have got your chance at last, Launcelot. I should  be content to die to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two sisters, pale and venomous, glared at their nephew. But they could only look  at him. They could do nothing against him. He had won and they had lost; that was  all. They felt strange buzzing noises in their ears, and the carpeted floor of the  room seemed reeling up and down like the deck of a storm-tost vessel. This was all  that they felt just at present. The shock was so great that its first effect was  only to produce a kind of physical numbness which extended even to the brain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t  suppose that either of these elderly ladies, each of whom wore stuff shoes and crisp  little curls of unnaturally brown hair upon her forehead, could, by any possibility,  have spent upon her own wants more than a hundred pounds a-year; nor had either  of them been accustomed to indulge in the sweet luxury of charity. They were neither  generous nor ambitious. They were entirely without the capacity of spending money  either upon themselves or on other people, and yet they had striven as eagerly for  the possession of this fortune as ever any proud, ambitious spirit strove for the  golden means by which he hoped to work his way upon the road that leads to glory.</p>
<p>They  were fond of money; they were fond of money, <em>per se;</em> without reference to  its uses, either noble or ignoble. They would have been very happy in the possession  of their dead kinsman&rsquo;s fortune, though they might have gone down to their graves  without having spent so much as the two hundred a-year which they received by this  cruel will. They would have hoarded the government securities in an iron safe; they  would have added interest to principal; they would have nursed the lands, and raised  the rents, and been hard and griping with the tenants, and would have counted their  gains and calculated together the increase of their wealth; but they would have  employed the same cobbler who had worked for them before their uncle&rsquo;s death; they  would still have given out their stuff shoes to be mended; and they would have been  as sharp as ever as to an odd sixpence in their dealings with the barber who dressed  their crisp brown curls.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell kept his place beside his mother&rsquo;s chair though the reading of the will  was finished, and the clerk was folding the sheets upon which it was written. Never  had any living creature shown less elation than this young man did upon his accession  to such a very large fortune.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton went up to the little table at which the lawyer&rsquo;s clerk sat, folding up  the papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you let me look at that will for a moment, Mr. Lamb?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The  clerk looked up at him with an expression of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  wish to look at it&mdash;?&rdquo; he said, hesitating a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  There is no objection to my doing so, is there? It will be sent to Doctors&rsquo; Commons,  I suppose, where anybody will be able to look at it for a shilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  clerk handed Gilbert Monckton the document with a feeble little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  it is, Mr. Monckton,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You remember your own signature, I dare say; you&rsquo;ll  find it there along with mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, there was the signature. It is not a very easy thing for  the cleverest man, who is not a professional expert, to decide upon the authenticity  of his own autograph. There it was. Gilbert Monckton looked at the familiar signature,  and tried in vain to find some flaw in it. If it was a forgery, it was a very skilful  one. The lawyer perfectly remembered the date of the will which he had witnessed,  and the kind of paper upon which it had been written. The date and the paper of  this corresponded with that recollection. </p>
<p>The  body of the will was in the handwriting of the clerk himself. It was written upon  three sheets of foolscap paper, and the signatures of the testator and the two witnesses  were repeated at the bottom of every page. Every one of the three autographs differed  from the others in some trifling point, and this circumstance, small in itself,  had considerable influence upon Gilbert Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  this will had been a forgery, prepared by Launcelot Darrell, the signatures would  have been fac-similes of each other,&rdquo; thought the lawyer; &ldquo;that is a mistake which  forgers almost always fall into. They forget that a man very rarely signs his name  twice alike. They get hold of one autograph and stereotype it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What  was he to think, then? If this will was genuine, Eleanor&rsquo;s accusation must be a  falsehood. Could he believe this? Could he believe that his wife was a jealous and  vindictive woman, capable of inventing a lie in order to revenge herself upon the  infidelity of the man she had loved? To believe this would be most everlasting misery.  Yet how could Gilbert Monckton think otherwise, <em>if</em> the will was genuine?  Everything hinged upon that, and every proof was wanting against Launcelot Darrell.  The housekeeper, Mrs. Jepcott, declared most distinctly that nobody had entered  the dead man&rsquo;s room or touched the keys upon the table by the bed. This alone, if  the woman&rsquo;s word was to be depended upon, gave the lie to Eleanor&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>But  this was not all. The will was in every particular the very opposite of such a will  as would be likely to be the work of a forger.</p>
<p>It contained  legacies to old friends of the dead man whom he had not himself seen for twenty  years, and whose very names must have been unknown to Launcelot Darrell. It was  the will of a man whose mind lived almost entirely in the past. There was a gold  snuff-box bequeathed &ldquo;to my friend Peter Sedgewick, who was stroke in the Magdalen  boat at Henley-on-the-Thames, fifty-seven years ago, when I was six in the same  boat;&rdquo; there was an onyx shirt-pin left &ldquo;to my old boon companion Henry Laurence,  who dined with me at the Beefsteak Club with George Vane and Richard Brinsley Sheridan  on my birthday.&rdquo; The will was full of personal recollections dated fifty years back;  and how was it possible that Launcelot Darrell could have fabricated such a will;  when by Eleanor&rsquo;s own admission he had no access to the genuine document until he  came to substitute the forgery after his uncle&rsquo;s death? The forgery must therefore,  Gilbert Monckton argued, have been prepared while the young man was in utter ignorance  as to the tenor of the actual will, according to Eleanor&rsquo;s story; and this, the  lawyer reasoned, was proof conclusive against his wife.</p>
<p>Launcelot  could not have fabricated such a will as this. This will, therefore, was genuine,  and Eleanor&rsquo;s accusation was only prompted by a sudden burst of jealous rage, which  had made her almost indifferent to consequences. Mr. Monckton examined the signatures  again and again, and then, looking very sharply at the clerk, said, in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  body of this will is in your handwriting, I believe, Mr. Lamb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can  you swear that this is the genuine document; the will which you wrote and witnessed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most  decidedly,&rdquo; the clerk answered, with a look of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have no suspicion whatever as to its authenticity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  sir, none! Have you any suspicion, Mr. Monckton?&rdquo; he added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.</p>
<p>The  lawyer sighed heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he said, giving the paper back to the clerk; &ldquo;I believe the will is genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just  at this moment there was a stir in the assembly, and Gilbert Monckton turned round  to see what was taking place.</p>
<p>It was  Mrs. Jepcott, the housekeeper, who was saying something to which everybody listened  intently.</p>
<p>The  reason of this attention which the housekeeper&rsquo;s smallest word received from every  member of that assembly, was the fact that she held a paper in her hand. Every eye  was fixed upon this paper. It might be a codicil revoking the will, and making an  entirely new disposition of the property.</p>
<p>A faint  red flush began to light up the wan cheeks of the two old maids, and Launcelot Darrell  grew more livid than death. But it was not a codicil; it was only a letter written  by Maurice de Crespigny, and addressed to his three nieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  night before my poor dear master died,&rdquo; the housekeeper said, &ldquo;I was sitting up  with him all alone, and he called me to him, and he told me to fetch him his dressing-gown,  which he&rsquo;d been wearing all through his illness, whenever he sat up; and I fetched  it; and he took a sealed letter out of the breast-pocket, and he said to me, &lsquo;Jepcott,  when my Will is read, I expect my three nieces will be very much disappointed, and  will think I have not treated them fairly; so I&rsquo;ve written them a letter, begging  them not to be angry with me after I&rsquo;m dead and gone; and I want you to keep it,  and take care of it, until the Will has been read, and then give it to my eldest  niece, Sarah, to read aloud to her two sisters in the presence of everybody.&rsquo; And  this is the letter, Miss,&rdquo; added Mrs. Jepcott, handing the sealed letter to Sarah  de Crespigny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  God!&rdquo; thought Gilbert Monckton, &ldquo;I shall know now whether the will is genuine. If  it is a fabrication, this letter must bring detection upon the forger.&rdquo;</p>

  Deserted</strong></h2>
<p>The  letter written by the old man to his three nieces was read aloud by Miss Sarah in  the presence of the eager assembly. Amongst all those anxious listeners there was  no one who listened more intently than Gilbert Monckton.</p>
<p>Maurice  de Crespigny&rsquo;s letter was not a long one.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My dear Nieces&mdash;Sarah,  Lavinia, and Ellen,&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You  will all three be perhaps much surprised at the manner in which I have disposed  of my estate, both real and personal; but, believe me, that in acting as I have  done I have been prompted by no unkind feeling against you; nor am I otherwise than  duly grateful for the attention which I have received from you during my declining  years.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I think  that I have done my duty; but be that as it may, I have done that which it has been  my fixed intention to do for the last ten years. I have made several wills, and  destroyed one after another, but they have all been in the main point to the same;  effect and it has only been an old man&rsquo;s whimsical fancy that has prompted me to  make sundry alterations in minor details. The income of two hundred a year which  I have left to each of you will, I know, be more than enough for your simple wants.  The three incomes, by the wording of my will, will descend to my nephew, Launcelot  Darrell, after your deaths.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I have  tried to remember many old friends who have perhaps long ere this forgotten me,  or who may laugh at an old man&rsquo;s foolish bequests.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I do  not believe that I have wronged any one; and I trust that you will think kindly  of me when I am in my grave, and never speak bitterly of</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Your  affectionate uncle,<br>
&#8288;&ldquo;Maurice de Crespigny.&#8288;</p>
<p class="note">&#8288;&ldquo;<em>Woodlands,  February 20th.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was the old man&rsquo;s letter. There was not one syllable of its contents which in any  way disagreed with the wording of the will.</p>
<p>Launcelot  Darrell drew a long breath; and his mother, sitting close to him, with her hand  in his, could feel the clammy coldness of his fingers, and hear the loud thumping  of his heart against his breast.</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton took up his hat and walked out of the room. He did not want to have any  explanation with the man whom he fully believed&mdash;in spite of all Eleanor had said&mdash;to  be the fortunate rival who had robbed him of every chance of ever winning his wife&rsquo;s  heart.</p>
<p>He had  only one feeling now; and that was the same feeling which had taken possession of  him twenty years before&mdash;an eager desire to run away; to escape from his troubles  and perplexities, to get free of this horrible atmosphere of deceit and bewilderment;  to cast every hope, every dream behind; and to go out into the world once more,  joyless, unloved, hopeless; but at any rate, not the dupe of a false woman&rsquo;s specious  pretences.</p>
<p>He went  straight back to Tolldale while the crowd at Woodlands slowly dispersed, more or  less discontented with the day&rsquo;s proceedings. He went back to the grand old mansion  in which he had never known happiness. He asked whether his wife was with Miss Mason.  No, the man told him; Mrs. Monckton was in her own room, lying down.</p>
<p>This  was the very thing he wished. He didn&rsquo;t want to see Eleanor&rsquo;s beautiful face, framed  in shining bands of hazel-brown hair; that irresistible face whose influence he  dared not trust. He wanted to see his ward alone.</p>
<p>Laura  ran out of her dressing-room at the sound of her guardian&rsquo;s footstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;is it a forgery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,  Laura, go back into your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason obeyed, and Mr. Monckton followed her into the pretty little apartment, which  was a modern bower of shining maple-wood and flowery chintz, and flimsy lace and  muslin, frivolous and airy as the young lady herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit  down in a comfortable seat, guardian,&rdquo; said Laura, offering the lawyer a slippery  chintz-covered lounging-chair, so low as to bring Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s knees inconveniently  near his chin as he sat in it. &ldquo;Sit down and tell me all about it, for goodness  gracious sake. <em>Is</em> it forged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know, my dear, whether the will is genuine or not. It would be a very difficult  question to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  oh! good gracious me,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Mason, &ldquo;how can you be so unkind as to talk  about it like that, as if it didn&rsquo;t matter a bit whether the will is forged or not?  If it isn&rsquo;t forged, Launcelot isn&rsquo;t bad; and if he isn&rsquo;t bad, of course I may marry  him, and the wedding things won&rsquo;t be all wasted. I knew that something would happen  to make everything come right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura,&rdquo;  cried Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;you must not talk like this. Do you know that you are no longer  a child, and that you are dealing with the most solemn business in a woman&rsquo;s life.  I do not know whether the will by which Launcelot Darrell inherits the Woodlands  property is genuine or not; I certainly have reason to <em>think</em> that it <em>is</em> genuine, but I will not take upon myself to speak positively. But however that may  be, I know that he is not a good man, and you shall never marry him with my consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young lady began to cry, and murmured something to the effect that it was cruel  to use her so when she was ill, and had been taking oceans of lime-draughts; but  Mr. Monckton was inflexible. &ldquo;If you were to have a dozen illnesses such as this,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;they would not turn me from my purpose, or alter my determination. When  I voluntarily took upon myself the custody of your life, Laura, I undertook that  charge with the intention of accomplishing it as a sacred duty. I have faltered  in that duty; for I suffered you to betroth yourself to a man whom I have never  been able to trust. But it is not yet too late to repair that error. You shall never  marry Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  not? If he didn&rsquo;t commit a forgery, as Eleanor says he did, why shouldn&rsquo;t I marry  him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  he has never truly loved you, Laura. You admit that he was Eleanor&rsquo;s suitor before  he was yours? You admit that, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason pouted, and sobbed, and choked once or twice before she answered. Gilbert  Monckton waited impatiently for her reply. He was about as fit to play the mentor  as the young lady whom he had taken upon himself to lecture. He was blinded and  maddened by passionate regret, cruel disappointment, wounded pride, every feeling  which is most calculated to paralyse a man&rsquo;s reasoning powers and transform a Solomon  into a fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Laura gasped at last; &ldquo;he did propose to Eleanor first, certainly. But, then, she  led him on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  led him on!&rdquo; cried Mr. Monckton. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura  looked at him with a perplexed expression of countenance, before she replied to  this eager question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>you</em> know!&rdquo; she said, after a pause; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t exactly describe how she led  him on, but she <em>did</em> lead him on. She walked with him, and she talked to him;  they were always talking together and leaving me out of the conversation, which  was very rude of them, to say the least, for if I wasn&rsquo;t intellectual enough for  them, and couldn&rsquo;t quite understand what they were talking about&mdash;for Launcelot would  talk meta&mdash;&mdash;what&rsquo;s its name? you know; and who <em>could</em> understand such  conversation as that?&mdash;they might have talked about things I <em>do</em> understand,  such as Byron and Tennyson. And then she took an interest in his pictures, and talked  about chiaro&mdash;thingembob, and foreshortening, and middle distances, and things, just  like an artist. And then she used to let him smoke in the breakfast parlour when  she was giving me my music lessons; and I should like to know who <em>could</em> play  cinquepated passages in time, with the smell of tobacco in their nose, and a fidgetty  young man reading a crackling newspaper, and killing flies with his pocket handkerchief  against the window. And then she sat for Rosalind in his picture. But, good gracious  me, it&rsquo;s no good going all over it; she led him on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton sighed. There wasn&rsquo;t much in what his ward had said, but there was quite  enough. Eleanor and Launcelot had been happy and confidential together. They had  talked of metaphysics, and literature, and poetry, and painting. The young artist  had lounged away the summer mornings, smoking and idling, in Miss Vane&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>There  was very little in all this, certainly, but quite as much as there generally is  in the history of a modern love affair. The age of romance is gone, with tournaments,  and troubadours, and knight errantry; and if a young gentleman now-a-days spends  money in the purchase of a private box at Covent Garden, and an extra guinea for  a bouquet, or procures tickets for a fashionable flower show, and is content to  pass the better part of his mornings amidst the expensive litter of a drawing-room,  watching the white fingers of his beloved in the messy mysteries of <em>Decalcomanie</em>,  he may be supposed to be quite as sincerely devoted as if he were to plant his lady&rsquo;s  point-lace parasol cover in his helmet, and gallop away with a view to having his  head split open in her service.</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton hid his face in his hands, and pondered over what he had heard. Yes, his  ward&rsquo;s foolish talk revealed to him all the secrets of his wife&rsquo;s heart. He could  see the pretty, sunny morning room, the young man lounging in the open window, with  fluttering rose-leaves all about his handsome head. He could see Eleanor seated  at the piano, making believe to listen to her pupil, and glancing back at her lover.  He made the prettiest cabinet picture out of these materials for his own torment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you think Eleanor ever loved Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo; he asked, by and by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Do</em> I think so?&rdquo; cried Miss Mason. &ldquo;Why, of course I do; and that&rsquo;s why she tries to  persuade me not to marry him. I love her, and she&rsquo;s very good to me,&rdquo; Laura added,  hastily, half-ashamed of having spoken unkindly of the friend who had been so patient  with her during the last few days. &ldquo;I love her very dearly; but if she hadn&rsquo;t cared  for Launcelot Darrell, why did she go against my marrying him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton groaned aloud. Yes, it must be so. Eleanor had loved Launcelot, and her  sudden anger, her violent emotion, had arisen out of her jealousy. She was not a  devoted daughter, nursing a dream of vengeance against her dead father&rsquo;s foe; but  a jealous and vindictive woman, bent upon avenging an infidelity against herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura,&rdquo;  said Mr. Monckton, &ldquo;call your maid, and tell her to pack your things without a moment&rsquo;s  delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  going to take you abroad,&mdash;immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good gracious! And Eleanor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor  will stay here. You and I will go to Nice, Laura, and cure ourselves of our follies&mdash;if  we can. Don&rsquo;t bring any unnecessary load of luggage. Have your most useful dresses  and your linen packed in a couple of portmanteaus, and let all be ready in an hour&rsquo;s  time. We must leave Windsor  by the four o&rsquo;clock train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  my wedding things&mdash;what am I to do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pack  them up. Burn them, if you like,&rdquo; answered Gilbert Monckton, leaving his ward to  get over her astonishment as she best might.</p>
<p>He encountered  her maid in the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Mason&rsquo;s portmanteau must be packed in an hour, Jane,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going to take  her away at once for change of air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Monckton went down-stairs to his study, and shutting himself in, wrote a very long  letter, the composition of which seemed to give him a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>He looked  at his watch when this letter was finished, folded, and addressed. It was a quarter  past two. He went up-stairs once more to Laura&rsquo;s dressing-room, and found that young  lady in the wildest state of confusion, doing all in her power to hinder her maid,  under the pretence of assisting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put  on your bonnet and shawl and go down-stairs, Laura,&rdquo; Mr. Monckton said decisively.  &ldquo;Jane will never succeed in packing those portmanteaus while you are fidgeting her.  Go down into the drawing-room, and wait there till the boxes are packed and we&rsquo;re  ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  mustn&rsquo;t I go and say good-bye to Eleanor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  she still in her own room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; the maid answered, looking up from the portmanteau before which she was kneeling.  &ldquo;I peeped into Mrs. Monckton&rsquo;s room just now, and she was fast asleep. She has had  a great deal of fatigue in nursing Miss Mason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, she had better not be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  if I&rsquo;m going to Nice,&rdquo; remonstrated Laura, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go so far away without saying  good-bye to Eleanor. She has been very kind to me, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  changed my mind,&rdquo; Mr. Monckton said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking over the matter, and I&rsquo;ve  decided on not taking you to Nice. Torquay will do just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Mason made a wry face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought  I was to have change of scene,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Torquay isn&rsquo;t change of scene, for I  went there once when I was a child. I might have forgotten Launcelot in quite a  strange place, where people talk bad French and wear wooden shoes, and everything  is different; but I shall never forget him at Torquay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert  Monckton did not notice his ward&rsquo;s lamentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Mason will want you with her, Jane,&rdquo; he said to the girl. &ldquo;You will get yourself  ready, please, as soon as you&rsquo;ve packed those portmanteaus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went  down-stairs again, gave his orders about a carriage to take him to the station,  and then walked up and down the drawing-room waiting for his ward.</p>
<p>In half-an-hour  both she and her maid were ready. The portmanteaus were put into the carriage&mdash;the  mail-phaeton which had brought Eleanor to Hazlewood two years before&mdash;and Mr. Monckton  drove away from Tolldale Priory without having uttered a word of adieu to his wife.</p>

  Gilbert&rsquo;s Letter</strong></h2>
<p>It was  late in the afternoon when Eleanor awoke, aroused by the clanging of the dinner-bell  in the cupola above her head. She had been worn out by her patient attendance upon  Laura during the last week, and had slept very heavily, in spite of her anxiety  to hear what had happened at the reading of the will. She had seen very little of  her husband since the night of Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s death, and, though the coldness  and restraint of his manner had much distressed her, she had no idea that he was  actually alienated from her, or that he had suffered his mind to become filled with  suspicions against her.</p>
<p>She  opened the door of her room, went out into the corridor, and listened. But all was  very still. She could only hear the faint jingling of glass and silver in the hall  below, as the old butler went to and fro putting the finishing touches to the dinner-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.  Monckton might have come to me to tell me about the will,&rdquo; she thought: &ldquo;he must  surely know how anxious I am to hear what has been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  bathed her flushed face, and dressed for dinner as usual. She put on a black silk  dress out of respect for her father&rsquo;s friend, whose funeral had been solemnised  during her sleep, and with a black lace shawl upon her shoulders she went down-stairs  to look for her husband.</p>
<p>She  found all very quiet&mdash;unnaturally quiet. It is strange how soon the absence of an  accustomed inhabitant makes itself felt in a house, however quiet the habits of  that missing person. Eleanor looked into the drawing-room and the study, and found  them both empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  is Mr. Monckton?&rdquo; she asked of the old butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,  ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am; two hours ago, a&rsquo;most. You knew he was going, didn&rsquo;t you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  old man&rsquo;s curiosity was excited by Eleanor&rsquo;s look of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you know as master was a-going to take Miss Mason away to the seaside for change  of air, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, I knew that he was going to do so, but not immediately. Did Mr. Monckton leave  no message for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  left a letter, ma&rsquo;am. It&rsquo;s on the mantelpiece in the study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  went to her husband&rsquo;s room with her heart beating high, and her cheeks flushed with  indignation against him for the slight he had put upon her. Yes; there was the letter,  sealed with his signet-ring. He was not generally in the habit of sealing his letters,  so he must have looked upon this as one of some importance. Mrs. Monckton tore open  the envelope. She turned pale as she read the first few lines of the letter. It  was written over two sheets of note paper, and began thus:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Eleanor,&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;When  I asked you to be my wife, I told you that in my early youth I had been deceived  by a woman whom I loved very dearly, though not as dearly as I have since loved  you. I told you this, and I implored you to remember my blighted youth, and to have  pity upon me. I entreated you to spare me the anguish of a second betrayal, a second  awakening from my dream of happiness.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Surely,  if you had not been the most cruel of women, you would have been touched by the  knowledge that I had already suffered so bitterly from a woman&rsquo;s treachery, and  you would have had mercy upon me. But you had no mercy. It suited you to come back  to this neighbourhood, to be near your former lover, Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  letter dropped from Eleanor&rsquo;s hands as she read these words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  former lover!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;my lover, Launcelot Darrell! Can my husband think that? <em>Can</em> he think that I ever loved Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  picked up the letter, and seated herself at her husband&rsquo;s writing-table. Then she  deliberately re-perused the first page of the lawyer&rsquo;s epistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  could he write such a letter?&rdquo; she exclaimed, indignantly. &ldquo;How could he think such  cruel things of me after I had told him the truth&mdash;after I had revealed the secret  of my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  went on with the letter:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;From  the hour of our return to Tolldale, Eleanor,&rdquo; wrote Gilbert Monckton, &ldquo;I knew the  truth&mdash;the hard and cruel truth&mdash;very difficult for a man to believe, when he has  built up his life and mapped out a happy future under the influence of a delusion  which leaves him desolate when it melts away. I knew the worst. I watched you as  a man only watches the woman upon whose truth his every hope depends, and I saw  that you still loved Launcelot Darrell. By a hundred evidences, small in themselves,  but damning when massed together, you betrayed your secret. You had made a mercenary  marriage, looking to worldly advantages to counterbalance your sacrifice of feeling;  and you found too late that the sacrifice was too hard for you to bear.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I watched  you day by day, and hour by hour; and I saw that as the time for Laura&rsquo;s marriage  approached, you grew hourly more unhappy, more restless, more impatient and capricious  in your manner towards Launcelot.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;On  the night of Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s death the storm burst. You met Launcelot Darrell  in the Woodlands garden&mdash;perhaps by chance, perhaps by appointment. You tried to  dissuade him against the marriage with Laura, as you had tried to dissuade Laura  from marrying him; and failing in this, you gave way to a frenzy of jealousy, and  accused your false lover of an impossible crime.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Remember,  Eleanor, I accuse you of no deadly sin; no <em>deliberate</em> treachery to me. The  wrong you have done me lies in the fact that you married me, while your heart was  still given to another. I give you credit for having tried to conquer that fatal  attachment, and I attribute your false accusations against Launcelot Darrell to  a mad impulse of jealousy, rather than the studied design of a base woman. I try  to think well of you, Eleanor, for I have loved you most dearly; and the new life  that I had made for myself owed all its brightness to my hope of winning your regard.  But it is not to be so. I bow my head to the decree, and I release you from a bond  that has no doubt grown odious to you.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I beg  you, therefore, to write me a final letter, demanding such terms of separation as  you may think fit. Let the ground of our parting be incompatibility of temper. Everything  shall be done to render your position honourable; and I trust to you to preserve  the name of Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s wife without taint or blemish. Signora Piccirillo  will no doubt act for you in this business, and consent to assume the position of  your guardian and friend. I leave you in full possession of Tolldale Priory, and  I go to Torquay with my ward, whence I shall depart for the Continent as soon as  our separation has been adjusted, and my business arrangements made.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My  address for the next fortnight will be the post-office, Torquay.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Gilbert Monckton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was the letter which the lawyer had written to his young wife. Its contents were  like a thunderbolt in the shock which they caused to Eleanor&rsquo;s senses. She sat for  a long time reading it over and over again. For the first time since her marriage  she put aside the thought of her revenge, and began to think seriously of something  else.</p>
<p>It was  too cruel. Unmixed indignation was the feeling which took possession of her mind.  She had no comprehension of the despair which had filled Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s breast  as he wrote that farewell letter. She did not know how the strong man had done battle  with his suspicions, struggling with every new doubt, and conquering it as it arose,  only to be conquered himself at last, by the irresistible force of circumstances,  every one of which seemed a new evidence against his wife. Eleanor could not know  this. She only knew that her husband had most bitterly wronged her, and she could  feel nothing but indignation&mdash;yet.</p>
<p>She  tore the letter into a hundred fragments. She wanted to annihilate its insulting  accusations. How dared he think so vilely of her? Then a feeling of despair sank  into her breast, like some actual burden, chill and heavy, that bowed her down to  the earth, and for the time paralysed her energies.</p>
<p>Nothing  but failure had met her upon every side. She had been too late in her attempt to  see Maurice de Crespigny before his death. She had failed to prove Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  guilt; though the evidence of his crime had been in her hands, though she had been  herself the witness of his wrong-doing. Everything had been against her. The chance  which had thrown her across the pathway of the very man she wished to meet, had  only given rise to delusive hopes, and had resulted in utter defeat.</p>
<p>And  now she found herself suspected and deserted by her husband,&mdash;the man whom she had  loved and respected with every better feeling of a generous nature that had been  warped and stunted by the all-absorbing motive of her life. In her indignation against  Gilbert Monckton, her hatred of Launcelot Darrell became even more bitter than before,  for it was he who had caused all this&mdash;it was he whose treachery had been the blight  of her existence, from the hour of her father&rsquo;s death until now.</p>
<p>While  Eleanor sat thinking over her husband&rsquo;s letter, the old butler came to announce  dinner, which had been waiting some time for her coming. I fancy the worthy retainer  had been prowling about the hall meanwhile, with the hope of reading the clue to  some domestic mystery in his mistress&rsquo;s face as she emerged from the study.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton went into the dining-room and made a show of eating her dinner. She had  a motive for doing this, beyond the desire to keep up appearances, which seems natural  even to the most impulsive people. She wanted to hear all about Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s  will, and she knew that Jeffreys, the butler, was sure to be pretty well informed  upon the subject.</p>
<p>She  took her accustomed seat at the dinner-table, and Mr. Jeffreys placed himself behind  her. She took a spoonful of clear soup, and then began to trifle with her spoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you heard about Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s will, Jeffreys?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  ma&rsquo;am, to tell the truth, we had Mr. Banks, the baker, from Hazlewood village, in  the servants&rsquo; hall not a quarter of an hour ago, and he <em>do</em> say that Mr. Darrell  has got all his great-uncle&rsquo;s estate, real and personil,&mdash;leastways, with the exception  of hannuities to the two old mai&mdash;the Miss de Crespignys, ma&rsquo;am, and bein&rsquo; uncommon  stingy in their dealin&rsquo;s, no one will regret as <em>they</em> don&rsquo;t come into the  fortune. Sherry, ma&rsquo;am, or &rsquo;ock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  touched one of the glasses before her almost mechanically, and waited while the  old man&mdash;who was not so skilful and rapid as he had been in the time of Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s  father&mdash;poured out some wine, and removed her soup-plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Banks of Hazlewood do say that Mr. Darrell have got the fortune.  He heard it from Mrs. Darrell&rsquo;s &rsquo;ousemaid, which Mrs. Darrell told all the servants  directly as she come back from Woodlands, and were all of a tremble like with joy,  the &rsquo;ousemaid said; but Mr. Launcelot, he were as white as a sheet, and hadn&rsquo;t a  word to say to any one, except the foreign gentleman that he is so friendly with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  paid very little attention to all these details. She only thought of the main fact.  The desperate game which Launcelot had played had been successful. The victory was  his.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton went from the dinner-table to her own room, and with her own hands dragged  a portmanteau out of a roomy old-fashioned lumber-closet, and began to pack her  plainest dresses, and the necessaries of her simple toilet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  leave Tolldale to-morrow morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will at least prove to Mr. Monckton  that I do not wish to enjoy the benefits of a <em>mercenary</em> marriage. I will  leave this place and begin the world again. Richard was right; my dream of vengeance  was a foolish dream. I suppose it is right, after all, that wicked people should  succeed in this world, and we must be content to stand by and see them triumph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  could not think without some bitterness of Laura&rsquo;s abrupt departure. <em>She</em> could not have been actuated by the same motives that had influenced Gilbert Monckton.  Why, then, had she left without a word of farewell? Why? Launcelot Darrell was the  cause of this sorrow as well as of every other, for it was jealousy about him that  had prejudiced Laura against her friend.</p>
<p>Early  the next morning Eleanor Monckton left Tolldale Priory. She went to the station  at Windsor in a  pony carriage which had been reserved for the use of herself and Laura Mason. She  took with her only one portmanteau, her desk, and dressing-case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  going alone, Martin,&rdquo; she said to the maid whom Mr. Monckton had engaged to attend  upon her. &ldquo;You know that I am accustomed to wait upon myself, and I do not think  you could be accommodated where I am going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you will not be away long, ma&rsquo;am, shall you?&rdquo; the young woman asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know. I cannot tell you. I have written to Mr. Monckton,&rdquo; Eleanor answered hurriedly.</p>
<p>In the  bleak early spring morning she left the home in which she had known very little  happiness. She looked back at the stately old-fashioned mansion with a regretful  sigh.</p>
<p>How  happy she <em>might</em> have been within those ivied walls! How happy she might have  been with her husband and Laura; but for the one hindering cause, the one fatal  obstacle&mdash;Launcelot Darrell. She thought of what her life might have been, but for  the remembrance of that solemn vow which was perpetually urging her on to its fulfilment.  The love of a good man, the caressing affection of a gentle girl, the respect of  every living creature round about her, might have been hers; but for Launcelot Darrell.</p>
<p>She  looked back at the old house, gleaming redly behind the leafless branches of the  bare oaks that sheltered it. She could see the oriel window of the morning room  that Gilbert Monckton had furnished on purpose for her, the dark crimson of the  voluminous curtains, and a Parian statuette, of his own choosing, glittering whitely  against the red light of the fire within. She saw all this, and regretted it; but  her pride was soothed by the thought that she was running away from this luxurious  home and all its elegance, to go out alone into a bleak uncomfortable world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  shall know, at least, that I did not marry him for the sake of a fine house and  horses and carriages,&rdquo; she thought, as she watched the terrace chimneys disappear  behind the trees. &ldquo;However meanly he thinks of me, he shall have no cause to think  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  still very early in the day when Eleanor arrived in London. She was determined not to go to the Signora,  since she must relate all that had happened, and would no doubt have considerable  difficulty in convincing her old friend that she had chosen the right course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Signora would want me to go back to Tolldale, and to try and justify myself in the  opinion of Gilbert Monckton,&rdquo; Eleanor thought. &ldquo;But I will never humiliate myself  to him. He has wronged me; and the consequences of that wrong must rest upon his  own head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You  see this young lady&rsquo;s nature was as undisciplined as it had been in her girlhood,  when she flung herself on her knees in the little Parisian chamber to take an oath  of vengeance against her father&rsquo;s destroyer. She had not yet learnt to submit. She  had not yet learnt the most sublime lesson that the Gospel teaches, to suffer unmerited  wrong, and take it patiently.</p>
<p>The  letter she had written to Gilbert Monckton was very brief.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Gilbert,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;you have most cruelly wronged  me, and I cannot doubt that the day will come in which you will know how baseless  your suspicions have been. Every word that I uttered in Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s house  upon the night of his death was true. I am quite powerless to prove my truth, and  I cannot be content to see Launcelot Darrell triumph. The mystery of the lost will  is more than I can comprehend, but I declare that it was in my possession five minutes  before I met you in the garden. If ever that will should be found, my justification  will be found with it. I look to you to watch my interests in this matter, but I  am quite incapable of remaining an inmate of your house while you think me the base  creature I should be if my accusations against Launcelot Darrell were in the slightest  degree false. I will never return to Tolldale until my truth has been proved. You  need not fear that I will do anything to bring discredit upon your name. I go out  into the world to get my own living, as I have done before.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Eleanor  Monckton.&rdquo;&#8288;</p>
<p>This  letter expressed very little of the indignation which filled Eleanor&rsquo;s breast. Her  pride revolted against the outrage which her husband had inflicted upon her; and  she suffered all the more acutely because beneath her apparent indifference there  lurked, in the innermost recesses of her heart, a true and pure affection for this  cruel Gilbert Monckton, whose causeless suspicions had so deeply wounded her.</p>
<p>In proportion  to the strength of her love was the force of her indignation, and she went away  from Tolldale with angry thoughts raging in her breast, and buoying her up with  a most factitious courage.</p>
<p>This  influence was still at work when she reached London. She had only a few pounds in her purse,  and it was necessary therefore that she should begin to get her own living immediately.  She had thought of this during her journey between Windsor  and London, and  had determined what to do. She took a cab, and drove to a quiet little hotel in  the neighbourhood of the Strand, left her portmanteau  and other packages there, and then walked to a certain institution for governesses  in the neighbourhood of Cavendish Square.  She had been there before, during her residence with the Signora, to make an inquiry  about pupils for the pianoforte, but had never given her name to the principal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must  call myself by a new name,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;if I want to hide myself from Gilbert  Monckton and from the Signora. I must write to her directly, by-the-bye, poor dear,  and tell her that I am safe and well; or else she will be making herself unhappy  about me, directly she hears I have left Tolldale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  principal of the Governess&rsquo; Institution was a stately maiden lady, with a rustling  silk dress and glossy braids of gray hair under a cap of point lace. She received  Eleanor with solemn graciousness, demanded her requirements and her qualifications,  and then, with a gold pencil-case poised lightly between the tips of her taper fingers,  deliberated for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Eleanor  sat opposite to her, watching her face very anxiously. She wanted some home, some  asylum, some hiding-place from a world that seemed altogether against her. She scarcely  cared where or what the place of refuge might be. She wanted to get away from Gilbert  Monckton, who had wronged and insulted her; and from Launcelot Darrell, whose treachery  was always strong enough to triumph over the truth.</p>
<p>But  of course she didn&rsquo;t say this. She only said that she wanted a situation as musical  governess, nursery governess, or companion, and that the amount of salary was of  very little importance to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo;  the lady principal replied, slowly, &ldquo;I perfectly understand your feeling, Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  name is Villars,&rdquo; Eleanor answered quickly, looking down at her muff as she spoke.</p>
<p>The  lady principal&rsquo;s eyes followed hers, and looked at the muff too. It was a very handsome  sable muff, which had cost five-and-twenty pounds, and had been given by Mr. Monckton  to his wife at the beginning of the winter. It was not at all in accord with Eleanor&rsquo;s  plain merino dress and woollen shawl, or with her desire to go out as a governess  without consideration of salary. Miss Barkham, the lady principal, began to look  rather suspiciously at her visitor&rsquo;s handsome face, and forgot to finish the sentence  which she had only just commenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  can command excellent references, Miss Villars, I suppose?&rdquo; she said, coldly.</p>
<p>Eleanor  flushed crimson. Here was an insurmountable difficulty at the very outset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;References,&rdquo;  she stammered, &ldquo;will references be necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most  decidedly. We could not think of sending out any young lady from this establishment  who could not command first-class references or testimonials. Some people are satisfied  with written testimonials; for myself, I consider a personal reference indispensable,  and I would not upon my own authority engage any lady without one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked very much distressed. She had no idea of diplomatising or prevaricating.  She blurted out the truth all at once, unappalled by the stern glances of Miss Barkham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  possibly give you a reference,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my friends do not know that I am in search  of a situation, and they must not know it. I assure you that I belong to a very  respectable family, and am quite competent to do what I profess to do.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter51"></a>Chapter 51<br>
  Mrs. Major Lennard</strong></h2>
<p>Miss Barkham stared at her visitor with a look of mingled horror and  astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  do not surely imagine, Miss Villars,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that anybody will engage you in  the responsible position of governess to their children, upon no better recommendation  than your own, I must confess, rather <em>confident</em> assertion of your merits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never  told a falsehood in my life, Miss Barkham,&rdquo; Eleanor answered, indignantly. &ldquo;If I  am without a friend whom I can ask to testify to my respectability, it is on account  of circumstances which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  be sure,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Barkham; &ldquo;that is the very thing we have to contend against.  This establishment is completely overrun by young ladies, who think there is nothing  easier than to turn their backs upon their friends and their homes, and go out into  the world to become the instructresses of the rising generation. You think me very  punctilious and strait-laced, I daresay, Miss Villars; but I don&rsquo;t know what would  become of the rising generation if <em>somebody</em> didn&rsquo;t keep watch and ward over  the doors of the school-room. Young ladies who choose to feel unhappy in the society  of their parents; young ladies who are disappointed in some sentimental affection;  young ladies who fancy themselves ill-used by their elder sisters; young ladies  who, from the very shallowness of their own minds, cannot be contented anywhere,  all come to us, and want to go out as governesses,&mdash;just for a change, they say,  in the hope of finding a little employment that will divert their minds&mdash;as if they  had any minds to be diverted! These are the amateur hangers-on of a very grave and  respectable profession, to which hundreds of estimable and accomplished women have  devoted the best and brightest years of their lives. These are the ignorant and  superficial pretenders who bring their cheap and worthless wares into the market;  in order to undersell the painstaking and patient teachers who have themselves learned  the lessons they profess to teach. And these amateurs will continue to flourish,  Miss Villars; so long as ladies, who would shudder at the idea of entrusting an  expensive silk dress to an incompetent dressmaker, are willing to confide the care  of their children to an instructress whose highest merit lies in the fact that she  is&mdash;cheap. I do not wish to wound your feelings, Miss Villars; but I assure you I  often feel sick at heart, when I see a lady who offers thirty years&rsquo; experience,  and all the treasures of a mind carefully and sedulously cultivated, rejected in  favour of some chit of nineteen who can play one showy fantasia, and disfigure,  glass vases with scraps of painted paper; and who will accept twenty pounds a year  in payment of services that are not worth five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  smiled at Miss Barkham&rsquo;s energetic protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay  you are often very much worried by incompetent people,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I assure  you <em>I</em> have made no attempt to deceive you. I don&rsquo;t profess to do much, you  know. I believe I can play pretty well. May I play you something?&rdquo; she asked, pointing  to an open pianoforte at one end of the room, a handsome grand, with all Erard&rsquo;s  patent improvements, on which governesses upon their promotion were in the habit  of showing off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  no objection to hear you play,&rdquo; Miss Barkham answered; &ldquo;but remember, I cannot possibly  procure you a situation without either references or testimonials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  went to the piano, took off her gloves, and ran her fingers over the keys. She had  played very little during the last few months, for in the feverish preoccupation  of her mind she had been unequal to any feminine employment; too restless and unsettled  to do anything but roam about the house, or sit brooding silently, with her hands  lying idle in her lap.</p>
<p>The  familiar touch of the keys filled her with a strange pleasure; she was surprised  at the brilliancy of her execution, as good players often are after an interval  of idleness. She played one of Beethoven&rsquo;s most sparkling sonatas; and even Miss  Barkham, who was perpetually listening to such performances, murmured a few words  of praise.</p>
<p>But  before Eleanor had been seated at the piano more than five minutes, a servant came  into the room and presented a card to Miss Barkham, who rose from her seat with  some appearance of vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,  I scarcely know what to do about it,&rdquo; she muttered to herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost impossible  to arrange anything at such very short notice. Excuse me, Miss Villars,&rdquo; she added,  aloud, to Eleanor, &ldquo;I am obliged to see a lady in the next room. Don&rsquo;t go until  I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  bowed, and went on playing. She finished the sonata; and then, suddenly catching  sight of her wedding ring and the thick band of gold studded with diamonds that  her husband had given her on her wedding-day, she stopped to draw the two rings  off her finger, and put them into her purse amongst the few sovereigns that formed  her whole stock of worldly wealth.</p>
<p>She  sighed as she did this, for it seemed like putting off her old life altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  better so,&rdquo; she said to herself; &ldquo;I know now that Gilbert must have thought me false  to him from the very first. I can understand his cold reserve <em>now</em>, though  it used to puzzle me so much. He changed almost immediately after our marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  Monckton grew very pensive as she remembered that she had been perhaps herself to  blame for the altered manner, and no doubt equally altered feelings, of her husband.  She had neglected her duty as a wife, absorbed in her affection as a daughter; she  had sacrificed the living to the dead; and she began to think that Richard Thornton&rsquo;s  advice had been wiser than she had believed when she refused to listen to it. She  had been wrong altogether. Classic vows of vengeance were all very well in the days  when a Medea rode upon flying dragons and slaughtered her children upon principle;  but a certain inspired teacher, writing a very long time after that much-to-be-regretted  classic age, has declared that vengeance is the right of divinity alone, and far  too terrible an attribute to be tampered with by fallible mortals, blindly hurling  the bolts of Heaven against each other&rsquo;s earthly heads.</p>
<p>She  thought this, and grew very melancholy and uncomfortable, and began to fancy that  her impulses had been about the worst guides that she could have chosen. She began  to think that she had not acted so very wisely in running away from Tolldale Priory  in the first heat of her indignation, and that she might have done better perhaps  by writing a temperate letter of justification to Gilbert Monckton, and quietly  abiding the issue. But she had chosen her path now, and must stand by her choice,  on pain of appearing the weakest and most cowardly of women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  letter is posted,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;Gilbert will receive it to-morrow morning.  I <em>should</em> be a coward to go back; for however much I may have been to blame  in the matter, he has treated me very badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  wiped away some tears that had come into her eyes as she took the rings from her  wedding finger, and then began to play again.</p>
<p>This  time she dashed into one of the liveliest and most brilliant fantasias she could  remember, a very <em>pot-pourri</em> of airs; a scientific hodge podge of Scotch melodies;  now joyous, now warlike and savage, now plaintive and tender; always capricious  in the extreme, and running away every now and then into the strangest variations,  the most eccentric cadences. The piece was one of Thalberg&rsquo;s <em>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres</em>,  and Eleanor played it magnificently. As she struck the final chords, sharp and rapid  as a rattling peal of musketry, Miss Barkham re-entered the room.</p>
<p>She  had the air of being rather annoyed, and she hesitated a little before speaking  to Eleanor, who rose from the piano and began to put on her gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,  Miss Villars,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is most incomprehensible to me, but since Mrs. Lennard  herself wishes it, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  stopped and fidgetted a little with the gold pencil-case hanging to her watch-chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  at all understand this sort of thing,&rdquo; she resumed; &ldquo;however, of course I wash my  hands of all responsibility. Have you any objection to travel, Miss Villars?&rdquo; she  asked, suddenly.</p>
<p>Eleanor  opened her eyes with a look of astonishment at this abrupt question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Objection to travel?&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you any objection to go abroad&mdash;to Paris,  for instance&mdash;if I could obtain you a situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; Eleanor answered, with a sigh, &ldquo;not at all; I would just as soon go to Paris as anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, if that is the case, I think I can get you a situation immediately.  There is a lady in the next room who was here yesterday, and who really gave me  a most severe headache with her fidgety, childish ways. However, she wants to meet  with a young lady as a companion <em>immediately</em>&mdash;that is the grand difficulty.  She leaves London for Paris by this evening&rsquo;s mail, and she put off engaging the  person she required until yesterday afternoon, when she came to me in a fever of  anxiety, and wanted me to introduce her to a lady instanter. She stopped all the  afternoon in the next room, and I took ever so many young ladies in to her, all  of whom seemed well qualified for the situation, which really demands very little.  But not one of them would suit Mrs. Lennard. She was very polite to them, and made  all kinds of affable speeches to them, and dismissed them in the most ladylike manner;  and then she told me afterwards that she didn&rsquo;t take a fancy to them, and she was  determined not to engage any one she didn&rsquo;t take a fancy to, as she wanted to be  very fond of her companion, and make quite a sister of her. That was what she said,  and, good gracious me,&rdquo; cried Miss Barkham, &ldquo;how am I to find her somebody she can  take a fancy to, and make a sister of, at a quarter-of-an-hour&rsquo;s notice? I assure  you, Miss Villars, my head felt quite in a whirl after she went away yesterday afternoon;  and it&rsquo;s beginning to be in a whirl again now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  waited very patiently while Miss Barkham endeavoured to collect her scattered senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can  scarcely hope this very capricious lady will take a fancy to me,&rdquo; she said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  my dear,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Barkham, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the very thing I came to tell you. She <em>has</em> taken a fancy to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken  a fancy to me!&rdquo; repeated Eleanor; &ldquo;but she has not seen me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course not, my dear. But she really is the most confusing, I may almost say bewildering,  person I ever remember meeting with. I was in the next room talking to this Mrs.  Lennard, who is very pretty and fashionable-looking, only a little untidy in her  dress, when you began to play that Scotch fantasia. Mrs. Lennard stopped to listen,  and after she had listened a few moments, she cried out suddenly, &lsquo;Now, I dare say  that&rsquo;s an old frump?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;What, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; for, upon my word, my dear, I didn&rsquo;t  know whether she meant the piece, or the piano, or what. &lsquo;I dare say the lady who&rsquo;s  playing is an old frump,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Old frumps almost always play well; in point  of fact, old frumps are generally very clever. But I&rsquo;m determined not to have any  one I can&rsquo;t make a sister of; and I must have one by three o&rsquo;clock this afternoon,  or Major Lennard will be cross, and I shall go mad.&rsquo; Well, Miss Villars, I told  Mrs. Lennard your age, and described your appearance and manners, that is to say,  as well as I was able to do so after our very brief acquaintance, and I had no sooner  finished, than she exclaimed, &lsquo;That will do; if she can play Scotch melodies like  that, and is nice, I&rsquo;ll engage her.&rsquo; I then explained to Mrs. Lennard that you could  give no references; &lsquo;and that of course,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;would be an insuperable objection;&rsquo;  but she interrupted me in a manner that would have appeared very impertinent in  any one but her, and cried out, &lsquo;Insuperable fiddlesticks! If she&rsquo;s nice, I&rsquo;ll engage  her. She can play to me all the morning while I paint upon velvet;&rsquo; and you&rsquo;re to  come with me, please Miss Villars, and be introduced to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  took up her muff and followed Miss Barkham on to the landing, but at this moment  three ladies appeared upon the top stair, and the principal of the establishment  was called upon to receive them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you&rsquo;ll go in by yourself, my dear,&rdquo; she whispered to Eleanor, pointing to the door  of the back drawing-room, &ldquo;I shall be much obliged; you&rsquo;ll find Mrs. Lennard a most  affable person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  readily assented. She opened the door and went into the primly-furnished back drawing-room.  Mrs. Major Lennard was a little woman, and she was standing on tiptoe upon the hearthrug,  in order to survey herself in the chimney-glass while she re-arranged the pale blue  strings of her black velvet bonnet. Eleanor paused near the door, waiting for her  to turn round, and wondering what she was like, as the face in the glass was not  visible from where Mrs. Monckton stood.</p>
<p>The  lady employed a considerable time in the important operation of tying her bonnet-strings,  then suddenly hearing the rustling of Eleanor&rsquo;s dress as she advanced a few paces,  Mrs. Lennard uttered an exclamation, and turned round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  naughty girl, you quite startled me,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Not  so much as she had startled Eleanor, who could not repress a cry of surprise at  the sight of her face. It was a very pretty face, very young-looking, though Mrs.  Major Lennard was nearly forty years of age. A fair childish face, with pink cheeks,  turquoise-blue eyes, and the palest, softest bands of flaxen hair; rather an insipid,  German kind of beauty, perhaps, but very perfect of its kind.</p>
<p>But  that which had startled Eleanor was not the babyish, delicate prettiness of the  face, but the strong resemblance which it bore to Laura Mason. It was the same face  after twenty years, not of wear and tear, but of very careful preservation. This  lady, in appearance and manner, was exactly what Laura must most surely become if  she lived to be seven-and-thirty years of age.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter52"></a>Chapter 52<br>
  Going Back To Paris</strong></h2>
<p>Eleanor was so completely bewildered by this extraordinary likeness  that she remained for some moments staring at Mrs. Major Lennard in silent surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness  me, my dear!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, &ldquo;how astonished you look! I hope I&rsquo;m not a guy.  Frederick&mdash;that&rsquo;s Major Lennard, you know&mdash;never liked this bonnet, and really I&rsquo;m  beginning quite to dislike it myself. I do think its <em>pokey</em>. But never mind  that, my dear Miss&mdash;Villars, I think Miss Barkham said,&mdash;a very nice person, Miss  Barkham, isn&rsquo;t she, but rather prim. I&rsquo;ve got all sorts of business to settle between  this and eight o&rsquo;clock, for Fred <em>will</em> travel by the night-mail, because he  sleeps all the way, and of course that makes the journey shorter&mdash;in consequence  of which I&rsquo;ve never seen Dover, except in the dark, and I always think of it with  the lamps lighted and the pier slippery, and everybody hurrying and pushing, like  a place in a dream. But the first question, my dear, that we&rsquo;ve got to settle, is  whether you like me, and think you could make a sister of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  question, asked very eagerly, was really too much for poor Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  please don&rsquo;t look so surprised,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard exclaimed, entreatingly; &ldquo;you make  me fancy I&rsquo;m a guy, and you see there&rsquo;s really no time to be lost, and we must decide  immediately, if you please. I was here all yesterday afternoon, and I saw legions  of ladies, but there wasn&rsquo;t one that I could take a fancy to, and my only motive  for engaging a companion is to have somebody that I shall like very much, and always  feel at home with, and I want some one who can play the piano and be agreeable and  lively, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re the very person, dear, and if you only think you can  like me as well as I&rsquo;m sure I shall like you, we can settle the business at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you know that I can give you no references,&rdquo; Eleanor said, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course I do,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Lennard. &ldquo;Miss Barkham told me all about it. As <em>if</em> I thought you&rsquo;d committed a murder, or done something horrid, just because you can&rsquo;t  pounce upon half-a-dozen people ready to declare you&rsquo;re an uncanonised saint all  in a moment. I like your looks, my dear, and when I like people&rsquo;s looks at first  sight, I generally like <em>them</em> afterwards. And you play magnificently, I only  wish I could; and I used to play the overture to &rsquo;S&eacute;miramide&rsquo; before I was married,  but as Frederick doesn&rsquo;t like overtures, and as we&rsquo;ve been scampering about the  world ever since, in the cabins of ships, and in tents, and all sorts of places  where you couldn&rsquo;t have pianos, unless you had them made on purpose, without legs,  I&rsquo;ve gone backwards in my music till I can&rsquo;t play so much as a polka, without skipping  the difficult parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Lennard went on to say that the matter of salary was a question to be settled between  Miss Villars and the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always  leave money matters to Frederick,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;for though he can&rsquo;t add up the bills, he looks as if he could, and that&rsquo;s <em>some</em> check upon people. But you&rsquo;ll have to wait for your quarter&rsquo;s money  now and then, I dare say, dear, because we&rsquo;re often a little behind-hand, you know,  and if you don&rsquo;t mind that, it&rsquo;ll be all the better for you, as Fred&rsquo;s almost sure  to give you a silk dress when your quarter comes due, and he can&rsquo;t pay you; that&rsquo;s  what he calls a sop to Cerberus, and I&rsquo;m sure the money he spends in keeping people  &lsquo;sweet,&rsquo; as he calls it, would keep us altogether if we paid ready money. Now, is  it a settled thing, Miss Villars? Will you accept the situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  assented without hesitation. She heard very little of Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s good-natured  babble. Her whole mind was absorbed by the sense of her defeat, and by the feeling  that she had no further chance of a victory over Launcelot Darrell. She despaired,  but she did not submit. She was only desperate and reckless, ready to go anywhere,  and finish the useless remainder of her existence anyhow. She was not prepared to  begin a new life upon a new plan, casting the old scheme of her life behind her,  as a mistake and a delusion. She was not able to do this yet.</p>
<p>While  Mrs. Lennard was gathering together a lot of frivolous-looking little whitey-brown  paper parcels that seemed to bear a strong family resemblance to herself, Miss Barkham  came into the room to ascertain the result of the interview between the two ladies.  Mrs. Lennard expressed herself in the most rapturous manner about Eleanor, paid  some small fee for the benefit of the institution, and departed, carrying her parcels  and taking Eleanor with her.</p>
<p>She  allowed her companion to assist her with the parcels, after a little good-natured  contention, and at the nearest corner summoned a cab which was dawdling lazily along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course the man will overcharge us,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard said, &ldquo;but we must be prepared  for that, and really I&rsquo;d rather be overcharged than have a row, as we generally  have when I&rsquo;m with the major, and summonses and counter-summonses, and all sorts  of disagreeables; not that I mind that half so much as foreign cabmen, who get excited,  and dance upon the pavement and make wild noises if you don&rsquo;t satisfy them; and  I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what <em>would</em> satisfy foreign cabmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Lennard took out her watch, which was a pretty little Geneva toy with an enamelled back, ornamented  with the holes that had once held diamonds. An anxious and intensely studious expression  came over Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s face as she looked at this watch, which was overweighted  by a heap of incomprehensible charms, amongst which chaotic mass of golden frivolity,  a skeleton, a watering-pot, a coffin, and a Dutch oven were distinguishable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  half-past five by <em>me</em>,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard said, after a profound contemplation  of the Geneva, &ldquo;so I should think it must be <em>about</em> a quarter to three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  took out her own watch, and settled the question. It was only half-past two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ve gained another quarter of an hour,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Lennard; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the worst  of pretty watches, they always will go too much, or else stop altogether. Freddy  bought me my watch, and he gave me my choice as to whether he should spend the money  in purple enamel and diamonds, or works, and I chose the purple enamel. But then,  of course I didn&rsquo;t know the diamonds would drop out directly,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard added,  thoughtfully.</p>
<p>She  drove about to half a-dozen shops, and collected more whitey-brown paper parcels,  a bandbox, a bird-cage, a new carpet-bag, a dog&rsquo;s collar, a packet of tea, and other  incongruous merchandise, and then ordered the man to drive to the Great Northern  Hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  staying at the Great Northern, my dear,&rdquo; she said, after giving this order. &ldquo;We  very often stay at hotels, for Frederick  thinks it&rsquo;s cheaper to pay fifteen shillings a day for your rooms than to have a  house, and servants&rsquo; wages, and coals and candles, and lard, and blacklead, and  hearthstone, and all those little things that run away with so much money. And I  should like the Great Northern very much if the corridors weren&rsquo;t so long, and the  waiters so stern. I always think waiters at grand hotels <em>are</em> stern. They  seem to look at one as if they knew one was thinking of the bill, and trying to  calculate whether it would be under ten pounds. But, oh, good gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed  Mrs. Lennard, suddenly, &ldquo;what a selfish creature I am, I&rsquo;ve quite forgotten all  this time that of course you&rsquo;ll want to go home to your mamma and papa, and tell  them where you&rsquo;re going, and get your boxes packed, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  shook her head with a sad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  no mother or father to consult,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am an orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  you?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lennard; &ldquo;then it must have been our destiny to meet, for I am  an orphan, too. Ma died while I was a baby, and poor pa died soon after my marriage.  He was disappointed in my marriage, poor dear old thing, though I&rsquo;m glad to think  it wasn&rsquo;t that, but gout in the stomach, that killed him. But you&rsquo;ll want to see  your friends, Miss Villars, won&rsquo;t you, before you leave London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Eleanor answered; &ldquo;I shall write to the only friends I have. I don&rsquo;t want to see  anyone; I don&rsquo;t want anyone to know where I am going. I left my portmanteau at an  hotel in Norfolk Street,  and I shall be glad if you will let me call for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Lennard gave the necessary order; the cabman drove to the hotel where Eleanor had  left her portmanteau, and thence to the Great Northern, where Mrs. Lennard conducted  her new companion to a very handsome apartment on the ground-floor, opening into  a palatial bed-chamber, whose splendour was a good deal impaired by the circumstances  that the stately Arabian bed, the massive easy-chairs, the sofa, the dressing-table,  and even the washhand-stand were loaded with divers articles of male and female  attire, which seemed to have been flung here and there by some harmless maniac disporting  himself about the room.</p>
<p>In the  very centre of all this disorder, upon a great black leather military travelling-case,  sat a big broad-chested man of about forty, with a good-natured, sun-burnt face,  a very fierce auburn moustache, and a thick stubble of crisp, wavy, auburn hair,  cut close to his head, in the development of which a disciple of Mr. George Coombe  would have scarcely discovered the organs that make a man either a general or a  philosopher. This sunburnt, good-humoured looking gentleman had taken off his coat  for the better accomplishment of his herculean labours; and, with his arms folded  and his legs crossed, with an embroidered slipper balanced upon the extremity of  his toes, and a meerschaum pipe in his mouth, he sat resting himself, after taking  the initiatory step of dragging everything out of the drawers and wardrobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  you <em>lazy</em> Freddy!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lennard, looking in at her lord and master with  a reproachful countenance, &ldquo;is that all you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  the blue bar&egrave;ge with the flounces to go?&rdquo; roared the major in the voice of an amiable  Stentor. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do anything till I knew that, and I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you  to come home. Have you got a companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!  yes! she&rsquo;s in the next room; such a dear, and awfully pretty. If you stare at her  much I shall be jealous, Freddy, for you know you <em>are</em> a starer, though you  never will confess it. <em>I&rsquo;ve</em> seen you, in Regent Street, when you&rsquo;ve thought I&rsquo;ve been  looking at the bonnets,&rdquo; added the lady, reproachfully.</p>
<p>Upon  this the major got up, and, lifting his wife in his arms, gave her such a hug as  a well-disposed bear might have bestowed upon the partner of his den. Major Lennard  was about six feet one and a-half in the embroidered slippers, and was as strong  as a gladiator in good training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  and be introduced to her,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Lennard; and she led her husband, in his  shirt-sleeves, nothing abashed, into the adjoining sitting-room.</p>
<p>The  major&rsquo;s conversational powers were not very startling. He made a few remarks about  the weather, which were more courteous than original. He asked Eleanor if she was  hungry, if she would have luncheon, or wait for a six o&rsquo;clock dinner, and if she  was a good sailor. Then, coming suddenly to a stand still, he demanded soda-water  and brandy.</p>
<p>It was  the habit of this amiable man to require this beverage on every possible occasion.  He was by no means a drunkard, though he was one of those good-natured noisy creatures  who can never be convivial without getting tipsy; but his existence was one perpetual  absorption of soda-water and brandy. Why he drank this mixture, which the uninitiated  are apt to consider insipid, was a mystery only to be explained by himself. He could  not have been perpetually thirsty; and I am inclined to think that this soda-water  and brandy was the desperate resource of a feeble intellect craving some employment,  rather than a physical want.</p>
<p>The  major and his wife retired to the bedroom and began their packing. When matters  grew very desperate Eleanor was summoned as a forlorn hope, and did her best to  reduce the chaos into something like order. This process occupied the time until  six o&rsquo;clock, when the major put on his coat and sat down to dinner.</p>
<p>But  even during dinner the packing business was not altogether suspended, for every  now and then, when there was a little pause in the banquet, Mrs. Lennard jumped  up from the table, and ran into the next room with her workbox, or her desk, or  something from the mantelpiece or one of the sofa-tables&mdash;sometimes a book, sometimes  a paper-knife, a thimble, a pair of scissors, a pen-wiper, or a packet of envelopes&mdash;and  then scampered back to her place before the waiter re-entered the room, and tried  to look as if she hadn&rsquo;t left her seat. The major meanwhile worked steadily on with  his knife and fork, only looking up from his plate to attend to the wants of Eleanor  and his wife.</p>
<p>At last  everything was ready. The addresses were fastened to the boxes and portmanteaus.  A bewildering canary bird&mdash;which rejoiced in every kind of noise and confusion, and  had been excruciatingly loud and shrill all the afternoon&mdash;was inducted into the  new brass cage which Mrs. Lennard had bought for it. A sharp little black-and-tan  terrier, the property of the major, was invested in the new collar, and securely  padlocked; Eleanor and Mrs. Lennard put on their shawls and bonnets; the major made  himself gigantic by the addition to his normal bulk of a rough great-coat, a Scotch  plaid, and half a dozen yards of woollen comforter; the bill was paid at the very  last moment, while the luggage was being piled upon the top of an extra cab; and  Major Lennard and his companions departed at a rattling pace for the London Bridge  terminus. There was just time enough for the major to get the tickets and choose  a comfortable carriage, before the train started. Away they flew through the darkness  of the bleak March night, and Eleanor felt that every throb of the shrieking engine  made the step that she had taken more irrevocable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  was not a word in Gilbert&rsquo;s letter that expressed sorrow at parting from me,&rdquo; she  thought. &ldquo;I had worn out his love, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  eleven o&rsquo;clock when they got to Dover.  Major Lennard slept all the way, with the lappets of his travelling cap, which was  a sort of woollen caricature of a Knight Templar&rsquo;s helmet, drawn closely over his  ears. Mrs. Lennard, who was very wide awake all the time, sat opposite to her husband,  with the canary bird on her lap. He had grown quiet at last, and had retired from  the world under a tent of green-baize. The bird&rsquo;s mistress made up for his silence  by talking incessantly throughout the journey; but it only seemed to Eleanor as  if she had a second Laura for her companion, and the succession of her own sad thoughts  was scarcely broken by Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>They  arrived in Paris  the next morning in time for breakfast at the great H&ocirc;tel du Palais, a monstrous  building, newly erected, and rich in the glitter of gilding and the glow of colour.  Here the major took up his abode, after deliberately expounding to his wife and  Eleanor the theory that the best and most expensive hotels are always the cheapest&mdash;in  the end. This moral had been the rule of the major&rsquo;s life, and had very often brought  him alarmingly near the awful abysses of insolvency.</p>
<p>The  gorgeous apartments in which Eleanor found herself were very unlike the low-ceilinged  little sitting-room in the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que; but her mind went back to that sad  time, nevertheless. She spent the morning in the agreeable employment of unpacking  Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s wardrobe, while the major and his wife sailed out of the great hotel  to sun themselves in the Rue Rivoli and on the Boulevards, and to wind up with a  drive in the Bois, and a little dinner at V&eacute;fours&rsquo;. When she had completed this  most wearisome task, and had arranged all the scraps of lace and ribbons, the gloves  and collars, and feminine furbelows, in a buhl chest of drawers and a gorgeous ebony  and gold wardrobe, Mrs. Monckton put on her bonnet and shawl, and went out into  the busy street.</p>
<p>The  tears rushed up to her eyes as she looked at the bright vista before her, and heard  the roll of the drum, and the tramp of soldiers&rsquo; feet in the courts of the Louvre.  Yes, there was the street along which she had walked by her father&rsquo;s side on the  last day of his blighted life. Her hands clenched themselves involuntarily as she  remembered that day; and that other bitter day of anguish in which she had knelt  upon the ground and sworn to be revenged upon George Vane&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>How  had she kept her oath? She smiled bitterly as she thought of the four years that  had passed since then, and the strange chance that had flung Launcelot Darrell in  her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went  away from this place while he was here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I come back to it now that  he is in England.  Is it my destiny, I wonder, always to fail in everything I attempt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  went to the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que. Nothing was changed. The same butcher was busy  in the shop; the same faded curtains of flowered damask hung behind the windows.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter53"></a>Chapter 53<br>
  Margaret Lennard&rsquo;s Delinquencies</strong></h2>
<p>Mrs. Major Lennard was very kind to Eleanor, and if kindness and friendliness  on the part of her employers could have made Mrs. Monckton comfortable, she might  have been entirely so in her new position.</p>
<p>But  comfort was a noun substantive whose very meaning must, I think, have been utterly  incomprehensible to Major and Mrs. Lennard. They had married very young, had started  in life all wrong, and had remained in a perpetual state of muddle, both mental  and physical, ever since. They were like two children who had played at being grown-up  people for twenty years or so; and who were as entirely childish in their play now  as they had been at the very beginning. To live with them was to exist in an atmosphere  of bewilderment and confusion; to have any dealings whatever with them was to plunge  at once into a chaos of disorder, out of which the clearest intellect could scarcely  emerge without having suffered complete disorganisation. The greatest misfortune  of these two people was the likeness they bore to each other. Had Major Lennard  been a man of vigorous intellect and strong will, or had he been merely possessed  of the average allowance of common sense, he might have ruled his wife, and introduced  some element of order into his existence. On the other hand, if Mrs. Lennard had  been a sensible woman she would no doubt have henpecked her husband, and would have  rescued the good-natured soldier from a hundred follies, by a well-timed frown,  or a sharp matronly nudge, as the occasion might demand.</p>
<p>But  they were both alike. They were two overgrown children of forty years of age; and  they looked upon the world as a great play-room, whose inhabitants had no better  occupation than to find amusement, and shirk the schoolmaster. They were generous  and kind hearted to a degree that, in the opinion of their wiser acquaintance, bordered  upon foolishness. They were imposed upon on every side, and had been imposed upon  during twenty years, without acquiring any moral wealth in the way of wisdom, from  their very costly experience. The Major had within the last twelve months left the  army on half-pay, on the death of a maiden aunt, who had left him eight hundred  a-year. Up to the date of receiving this welcome legacy, the soldier and his wife  had been compelled to exist upon Major Lennard&rsquo;s pay, eked out by the help of stray  benefactions which he received from time to time from his rich relatives. The family  to which the ponderous officer belonged was very numerous and aristocratic, owning  as its chief a marquis, who was uncle to the major.</p>
<p>So the  two big children had decided upon enjoying themselves very much for the rest of  their days, and as a commencement of this new life of idleness and enjoyment, Major  Lennard had brought his wife to Paris, whence they were to go to Baden-Baden, to  meet some of the major&rsquo;s aristocratic cousins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  might come in for the title himself, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard told Eleanor, &ldquo;if seventeen  of his first cousins, and first cousins once removed, would die. But, as I told  poor papa, when he grumbled at my marrying so badly, you can&rsquo;t expect seventeen  cousins to go off all in a minute, just to oblige us by making Freddy a marquis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps  nothing could have been happier for Eleanor than this life of confusion, this scrambling  and unsettled existence, in which the mind was kept in a tumult by trifling cares  and agitations; for in this perpetual disorganisation of her intellect, the lonely  girl had no time to think of her own troubles, or of the isolated position which  she had chosen for herself. It was only at night, when she went to bed, in a small  apartment very high up in the Hotel du Palais, and about a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s  walk from the chamber of the Major and his wife, that she had time to think of Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s triumph and her husband&rsquo;s unjust suspicions; and even then she could rarely  brood very long upon her troubles, for she was generally exhausted alike in mind  and body by the confusion and excitement of the day, and more likely to fall asleep  and dream of her sorrows than to lie awake and think of them.</p>
<p>Those  dreams were more troublesome to her than all the bewilderment of the day, for in  them she was perpetually renewing the old struggle with Launcelot Darrell, perpetually  upon the eve of victory, but never quite victorious.</p>
<p>The  Major lingered in Paris much longer than he had intended, for the big children found  the city of boulevards a most delightful play-ground, and frittered away a great  deal of money upon expensive dinners at renowned restaurants, ices, opera tickets,  new bonnets, Piver&rsquo;s gloves, Lubin&rsquo;s perfumes, and coach hire.</p>
<p>They  stopped at the Hotel du Palais, still acting on the Major&rsquo;s theory, that the most  expensive hotels are the cheapest&mdash;in the end. They dined occasionally at the table  d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te, with two or three hundred companions, and wasted a good deal of time in  the great saloons, playing at bagatelle, peering into stereoscopes, turning over  the daily papers, reading stray paragraphs here and there, or poring over a chapter  of a romance in the <em>feuilleton</em>, until brought to a standstill by a disheartening  abundance of difficult words.</p>
<p>After  breakfast, the Major left his wife and her companion, either to loll in the reading-room,  to stroll about the great stone quadrangle smoking cigars, and drinking occasional  brandy and soda, or to read the English papers at Galignani&rsquo;s, or to wait for the  post, or to meet a British acquaintance at Hill&rsquo;s caf&eacute;, or to stare at the raw young  soldiers exercising in the court-yards of the Louvre, or the copper-faced Zouaves  who had done such wonderful work in the Crimea; or perhaps to stumble across some  hoary-headed veteran who had fought under Napoleon the First, to make friendly speeches  to him in bad French, with every verb in a bewilderingly impossible tense, and to  treat him to little glasses of pale Cognac.</p>
<p>Then  Mrs. Lennard brought out her frame and her colour-box, and her velvets and brushes,  and all the rest of her implements, and plunged at once into the delightful pursuit  of painting upon velvet, an accomplishment which this lady had only newly acquired  in six lessons for a guinea, during her last brief sojourn in London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  young person who taught me called herself Madame Ascanio de Brindisi&mdash;but oh, Miss  Villars, if ever there was a cockney in this world, I think she was one&mdash;and she  said in her advertisement, that anybody could earn five pounds a-week easily at  this elegant and delightful occupation; but I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know how <em>I</em> should  ever earn five pounds a-week, Miss Villars, for I&rsquo;ve been nearly a month at this  one sofa cushion, and it has cost five-and-thirty shillings already, and isn&rsquo;t finished  yet, and the Major doesn&rsquo;t like to see me work, and I&rsquo;m obliged to do it while he&rsquo;s  out; just as if it was a crime to paint upon velvet. If you <em>would</em> mend those  gloves, dear, that are split across the thumb&mdash;and really Piver&rsquo;s gloves at four  francs, five-and-twenty what&rsquo;s its names? oughtn&rsquo;t to do so, though the Major says  it&rsquo;s my own fault, because I will buy six-and-a-quarters&mdash;I should be so much obliged,&rdquo;  Mrs. Lennard added, entreatingly, as she seated herself at her work in one of the  long windows. &ldquo;I shall get on splendidly,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if the Emperor doesn&rsquo;t  go for a drive; but if he does, I must leave off my work and look at him&mdash;he&rsquo;s such  a dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  was very willing to make herself what the advertisements call &ldquo;generally useful&rdquo;  to the lady who had engaged her. She was a very high-spirited girl, we know, quick  to resent any insult, sensitive and proud; but she had no false pride. She felt  no shame in doing what she had undertaken to do; and if, for her own convenience,  she had taken the situation of a kitchen-maid, she would have performed the duties  of that situation to the best of her ability. So she mended Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s gloves,  and darned that lady&rsquo;s delicate lace collars, and tried to infuse something like  order into her toilette, and removed the damp ends of cigars, which it was the major&rsquo;s  habit to leave about upon every available piece of furniture, and made herself altogether  so useful that Mrs. Lennard declared that she would henceforward be unable to live  without her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I know how it will be, you nasty provoking thing!&rdquo; the major&rsquo;s wife exclaimed; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll  go on in this way, and you&rsquo;ll make us fond of you, and just as we begin to doat  upon you, you&rsquo;ll go and get married and leave us, and then I shall have to get another  old frump like Miss Palllster, who lived with me before you, and who never would  do anything for me scarcely, but was always talking about belonging to a good family,  and not being used to a life of dependence. I&rsquo;m sure I used to wish she had belonged  to a bad family. But I know it&rsquo;ll be so, just as we&rsquo;re most comfortable with you  you&rsquo;ll go and marry some horrid creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  blushed crimson as she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think that&rsquo;s very likely,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!  you say that,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard answered, doubtfully, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t convince me quite  so easily. I know you&rsquo;ll go and marry; but you don&rsquo;t know the troubles you may bring  upon yourself if you marry young&mdash;as I did,&rdquo; added the lady, dropping her brush upon  her work, and breathing a profound sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troubles,  my dear Mrs. Lennard!&rdquo; cried Eleanor. &ldquo;Why it seems to me as if you never could  have had any sorrow in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seems, Hamlet!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Lennard, casting up her eyes  tragically; &ldquo;&lsquo;nay, it is; <em>I</em> know  not seems,&rsquo; as the Queen says to Hamlet&mdash;or perhaps it&rsquo;s Hamlet says so to the Queen,  but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Oh, Miss Villars! my life might have been very happy perhaps,  but for the blighting influence of my own crime; a crime that I can never atone  for&mdash;<em>nev-arr!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  would have been quite alarmed by this speech, but for the tone of enjoyment with  which Mrs. Lennard gave utterance to it. She had pushed aside her frame and huddled  her brushes together upon the buhl table&mdash;there was nothing but buhl and ormolu,  and velvet-pile and ebony, at the Hotel du Palais, and an honest mahogany chair,  a scrap of Kidderminster carpet, or a dimity curtain, would have been a relief to  the overstrained intellect&mdash;and she sat with her hands clasped upon the edge of the  table, and her light blue eyes fixed in a tragic rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crime,  Mrs. Lennard!&rdquo; Eleanor repeated, in that tone of horrified surprise which was less  prompted by actual terror, than by the feeling that some exclamation of the kind  was demanded of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  my dear, ker&mdash;rime! ker&mdash;rime is not too harsh a word for the conduct of a woman who  jilts the man that loves her on the very eve of the day appointed for the wedding,  after a most elaborate trousseau has been prepared at <em>his</em> expense, to say  nothing of heaps of gorgeous presents, and diamonds as plentiful as dirt&mdash;and elopes  with another man. Nothing could be more dreadful than that, could it, Miss Villars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  felt that she was called upon to say that nothing could be more dreadful, and said  so accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t despise me, then, or hate me, please, Miss Villars,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lennard; &ldquo;I  know you&rsquo;ll feel inclined to do so; but don&rsquo;t. I did it!&mdash;I did it, Miss Villars.  But I&rsquo;m not altogether such a wretch as I may seem to you. It was chiefly for my  poor Pa&rsquo;s sake; it was, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  was quite at a loss to know how Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s bad conduct to her affianced husband  could have benefited that lady&rsquo;s father, and she said something to that effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  you see, my dear, in order to explain that, I must go back to the very beginning,  which was when I was at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mrs.  Lennard evidently derived very great enjoyment from this kind of conversation, Eleanor  was much too good-natured to discourage it; so the painting upon velvet was abandoned,  for that morning at least, and the Major&rsquo;s wife gave a brief synopsis of her history  for the benefit of Mrs. Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must know, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard began, &ldquo;my poor Pa was a country gentleman; and  he had once been very rich; or at least his family&mdash;and he belonged to a very old  family, though not as aristocratic as the Major&rsquo;s&mdash;had once been very rich; but somehow  or other through the extravagance of one and another, poor Pa was dreadfully poor,  and his estate, which was in Berkshire, was heavily&mdash;what&rsquo;s its name?&mdash;mortgaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  gave a slight start at the word &ldquo;Berkshire,&rdquo; which  did not escape Mrs. Lennard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know Berkshire?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  some part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  my dear, as I said before, poor Papa&rsquo;s estate was very heavily mortgaged, and he&rsquo;d  scarcely anything that he could call his own, except the rambling old country-house  in which I was born; and beyond that he was awfully in debt, and in constant dread  of his creditors sending him to prison, where he might have finished his days, for  there wasn&rsquo;t the least possibility of his ever paying his debts by anything short  of a miracle. Now of course all this was very sad. However I was too young to know  much about it, and Papa sent me to a fashionable school at Bath where his sisters had gone when they were  young, and where he knew he could get credit for my education to be finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor,  hard at work at the split gloves, listened rather indifferently to this story, at  first; but little by little she began to be interested in it, until at last she  let her hands drop into her lap, and left off working, in order the better to attend  to Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Villars, it was at that school that I met the ruling star of my fate&mdash;that is  to say, the Major, who was then dreadfully young, without even the least pretence  of whiskers, and always sitting in a pastrycook&rsquo;s-shop in the fashionable street  eating strawberry ices. He had only just got his commission, and he was quartered  at Bath with his regiment, and his sister Louisa was my schoolfellow at Miss Florathorne&rsquo;s,  and he called one morning to see her, and I happened that very morning to be practising  in the drawing-room, the consequence of which was that we met, and from that hour  our destinies were sealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t  dwell upon our meetings, which Louisa managed for us, and which were generally dreadfully  inconvenient, for Fred used to clamber up the garden wall by the toes of his boots&mdash;and  he has told me since that the brickwork used to scratch off all the varnish, which  of course made it dreadfully expensive&mdash;but what will not love endure?&mdash;and hook himself  on as it were; and it was in that position, with nothing of him visible below his  chin, that he made me a most solemn offer of his hand and heart. I was young and  foolish, Miss Villars, and I accepted him, without one thought of my poor Papa,  who was the most indulgent of parents, and who had always let me do everything I  liked, and indeed owed upwards of fifty pounds, at a toy-shop in Windsor, for dolls and things  that he&rsquo;d bought me before I was grown up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  from that hour, Frederick and I were engaged, and he dropped a turquoise ring in  among the bushes at the bottom of the garden the next morning, and Louisa and I  had upwards of an hour&rsquo;s work to find it. We were engaged! But we were not long  allowed to bask in the sunshine of requited affection, for a fortnight after this  Frederick&rsquo;s regiment was ordered out to Malta,  and I was wretched. I will pass over my wretchedness, which might not be interesting  to you, Miss Villars, and I will only say that, night after night, my pillow was  wet with tears, and that, but for Louisa&rsquo;s sympathy, I should have broken my heart.  Frederick and I corresponded regularly under cover of Louisa, and that was my only  comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-and-by,  however, the time for my leaving school came&mdash;partly because I was seventeen years  of age, and partly because Papa couldn&rsquo;t settle Miss Florathorne&rsquo;s bills&mdash;and I went  home to the old rambling house in Berkshire. Here I found everything at sixes and  sevens, and poor Papa in dreadfully low spirits. His creditors were all getting  horribly impatient, he had all sorts of writs, and attachments, and judgments, and  contempt of courts, and horrors of that kind, out against him; and if they could  have put him into two prisons at once, I think they would have done it, for some  of them wanted him in Whitecross Street, and others wanted him in the Queen&rsquo;s Bench,  and it was altogether dreadful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Papa&rsquo;s only friend of late years had been a very learned gentleman, belonging to  a grand legal firm in the city, who had managed all his business matters for him.  Now this gentleman had lately died, and his only son, who had succeeded to a very  large fortune upon his father&rsquo;s death, was staying with my poor Papa when I came  home from school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope  you won&rsquo;t think me conceited, Miss Villars, but in order to make my story intelligible,  I&rsquo;m <em>obliged</em> to say that at that time I was considered a very pretty girl.  I had been the belle of the school at Miss Florathorne&rsquo;s, and when I went back to  Berkshire and mixed in society, people made a tremendous  fuss about me. Of course you know, my dear, troubles about money matters, and a  wandering life, and French dinners, which are too much for a weak digestion, have  made a very great difference in me, and I&rsquo;m not a bit like what I was then. Well,  the young lawyer who was staying with Papa&mdash;I shall not tell you his name, because  I consider it very dishonourable to tell the name of a person you&rsquo;ve jilted, even  to a stranger&mdash;was very attentive. However, I took no notice of that&mdash;though he was  very handsome and elegant-looking, and awfully clever&mdash;for my heart was true to Frederick,  from whom I received the most heartrending letters under cover to Louisa, declaring  that, what with the mosquitoes and what with the separation from me, and owing debts  of honour to his brother officers, and not clearly seeing his way to pay them, he  was often on the verge of committing suicide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had  not told Papa of my engagement, you must know, my dear, because I felt sure he&rsquo;d  grumble about my engaging myself to a penniless ensign; though Fred might have been  a marquis, for at that time there were only eleven cousins between him and the title.  So one day Papa took me out for a drive with him, while Mr. &mdash;&mdash; while the  young lawyer was out shooting; and he told me that he was sure, from several things  the young lawyer had let drop, that he was desperately in love with me, and that  it would be his salvation&mdash;Pa&rsquo;s&mdash;if I would marry him, for he was sure that in that  case the young man, who was very generous and noble-minded, would pay his debts&mdash;Pa&rsquo;s&mdash;and  then he could go on the continent and end his days in peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  my dear Miss Villars, the scene between us was actually heartrending. I told Pa  that I loved another&mdash;I dared not say that I was actually engaged to poor dear Frederick&mdash;and  Pa entreated me to sacrifice what he called a foolish schoolgirl&rsquo;s fancy, and to  give some encouragement to a noble-hearted young man, who would no doubt get him  out of the most abominable trouble, and would make me an excellent husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you consented?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  my dear, after a great deal of persuasion, and after shedding actual oceans of tears,  and in compliance with Papa&rsquo;s entreaties, I began to give the young lawyer&mdash;I&rsquo;m obliged  to call him the <em>young</em> lawyer, because one is so apt to associate lawyers  with gray hair, and grumpiness, and blue bags&mdash;a little encouragement, and in about  a week&rsquo;s time he made me an offer, and I accepted it, though my heart was still  true to Frederick, and I was still corresponding with him under cover of Louisa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked very grave at this part of the story, and Mrs. Lennard interpreted her companion&rsquo;s  serious face as a mute reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know it was very wrong,&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;but then, what in goodness&rsquo; name was  I to do, driven to distraction upon one side by Pa, driven to distraction upon the  other side by Fred, who vowed that he would blow out his brains if I didn&rsquo;t write  to him by every mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  my dear, the young lawyer, whom I shall call in future my affianced husband, for  short, behaved most nobly. In the first place he bought Pa&rsquo;s estate, not that he  wanted it, but because Pa wanted the money; and then he lent Pa enough money, over  and above the price of the estate, to settle with all his creditors, and to buy  an annuity, upon which he could live very comfortably abroad. Of course this was  very generous of him, and he made quite light of it, declaring that my love would  have repaid him for much greater sacrifices. You know he thought I loved him, and  I really did try to love him, and to throw over poor Frederick, for Papa&rsquo;s sake;  but the more I tried to throw Frederick over, and the more distant and cold I made  my letters, the more heartrending he became, reminding me of the vows I had uttered  in the garden at Bath, and declaring that if I jilted him, his blood should be upon  my head. So, what with one thing and another, my life was a burden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  took Papa some time to settle all his debts, even with the assistance of my affianced  husband, but at last everything was arranged, and we started for a continental tour.  My affianced husband accompanied us, and the marriage was arranged to take place  at Lausanne. I need  not say that I was very unhappy all this time; and I felt that I was a very wicked  creature, for I was deceiving one of the best of men. Perhaps the worst of all was,  that my affianced husband had such perfect confidence in me, that I scarcely think  anything I could have said or done&mdash;short of what I did at the very last&mdash;could have  shaken his faith. He talked sometimes of my youth, and my childishness, and my simplicity,  until I used to feel a perfect Lucretia Borgia. Ah, Miss Villars, it was  dreadful, and I often felt inclined to throw myself at his feet and tell him all  about Frederick; but the thought of my poor Papa, and the recollection of the money  for the estate, which could not be paid back again, sealed my lips, and I went on  day after day deceiving the best of men. You see, I&rsquo;d gone too far to recede, and  oh, my dear, that is the awful penalty one always pays for one&rsquo;s wickedness&mdash;if you  begin by deceiving anyone, you&rsquo;re obliged to go on, and on, and on, from one deception  to another, until you feel the basest creature in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At  least that&rsquo;s how I felt when all the lovely dresses, and jewels, and things that  my affianced husband had ordered arrived from Paris. If I could have walked upon gold, Miss  Villars, I do think that foolish man&mdash;for he was quite foolish about me, though in  a general way he was so very clever&mdash;would have thought the purest bullion only fit  for paving stones under my feet. The silks and satins&mdash;satin wasn&rsquo;t <em>outr&eacute;</em> then, you know&mdash;would have stood alone if one had wanted them to do so; the lace&mdash;well,  I won&rsquo;t dwell upon that, because I daresay you think already that I shall never  have done talking, and are getting dreadfully tired of this long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Mrs. Lennard,&rdquo; Eleanor answered gravely, &ldquo;I am very much interested in your story.  You cannot tell how deeply it interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Major&rsquo;s wife was only too glad to receive permission to run on. She was one of those  people who are never happier than when reciting their own memoirs, or relating remarkable  passages in the history of their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  very eve of the wedding-day had arrived,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Lennard, in a very solemn,  and, indeed, almost awful voice, &ldquo;when the unlooked-for crisis of my destiny came  upon me like a thunderbolt. Pa and my affianced husband had gone out together, and  I was alone in one of the apartments which we occupied at Lausanne. It was about an hour before dinner,  and I was dressed in one of the silks that had come from Paris, and I was tolerably resigned to my fate,  and determined to do my best to make my affianced husband happy, and to prove my  gratitude for his goodness to my father. Imagine my horror, then, when I was told  that a lady wished to see me&mdash;an English lady&mdash;and before I could decide whether I  was at home or not, in rushed Louisa Lennard, very dusty and tumbled, for she had  only just arrived, and of course there was no railway to Lausanne from anywhere,  at that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  my dear Miss Villars, it seems that Frederick&rsquo;s  silence, which I had taken for resignation, was quite the reverse. Louisa had heard  of my intended marriage, and had written about it to her brother, and her brother  had gone nearly mad, and, being on the eve of obtaining leave of absence on account  of his bad health&mdash;the climate had knocked him up,&mdash;contrived to get away from Malta  immediately. He and his sister had managed to persuade their rich maiden aunt, who  was very fond of Frederick, and who left him all her money the other day, to take  them both to Switzerland, and there they were, with the rich maiden aunt, who was  very much knocked up by the journey, and who had not the least shadow of a suspicion  that she had been made a cat&rsquo;s-paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Villars, anybody,&mdash;even the hardest-hearted of creatures,&mdash;would have been touched  by such devotion as this, and for the moment I forgot all about my affianced husband&rsquo;s  generosity, and I gave that enthusiastic Louisa, who really was the moving spirit  of everything, a solemn promise that I would see Frederick that night, if only for  ten minutes. Of course I didn&rsquo;t tell her that the next day was appointed for my  wedding, because I was too much afraid of her anger, as she was devotedly attached  to her brother, and had heard my solemn vows in the garden at Bath; but the people  at the hotel told her all about it, in their nasty gossiping way: the consequence  of which was, that when I met Fred in the porch of the cathedral, while Papa and  my affianced husband were taking their wine after dinner, his goings on were really  awful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can  never describe that scene. When I look back at it, it seems like a dream&mdash;all hurry,  and noise, and confusion. Frederick declared that  he had come all the way from Malta  to claim me as his bride, and called my affianced husband a baron all covered with  jewels and gold, from the ballad of &lsquo;Alonzo the Brave&rsquo; which he had been in the  habit of reciting at school. And, poor dear fellow, now that I saw him again, my  heart, which had always been true to him, seemed more true to him than ever; and  what with Louisa, who was very strong-minded, going on at me, and calling me mercenary  and faithless and deceitful, and what with Frederick going down upon his knees in  that chilly porch, and getting up suddenly every time the person who showed the  cathedral to strangers happened to look our way, I scarcely knew what I said or  did, and Frederick extorted from me the promise that I would run away with him and  Louisa that very night, and be married to him as soon as ever we could find any  body that would marry us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can  never describe that dreadful night, Miss Villars; suffice it to say, that I ran  away without a bit of luggage, and that Frederick, Louisa, and I, performed the  most awful journey&mdash;almost all by diligence&mdash;and were nearly jolted to death between  Lausanne and Paris, where Fred, by the help of some English friends, contrived to  get the ceremony performed by a Protestant clergyman, at the house of the British  Consul, but not without a great deal of difficulty and delay, during which I expected  every day that my affianced husband would come tearing after me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  did nothing of the kind, however. I heard afterwards from Papa that he didn&rsquo;t show  the least disposition to pursue me, and he particularly requested that no attempt  should be made to prevent my doing exactly as I pleased with regard to Fred. If  he had pursued me, Miss Villars, I have no doubt I should have gone back and married  him, for I am very weak, and it is my nature to do whatever people wish me to do.  But all he did was to walk about very quietly, looking as pale as a ghost for a  day or two, and braving out all the ridicule that attached to him because of his  bride&rsquo;s running away from him upon the eve of the wedding-day, and then he parted  company with Papa, and went away to Egypt, and went up the Nile, and did all sorts  of outlandish things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  have you never seen him since?&rdquo; Eleanor asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  once,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Lennard, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the most singular part of the story. About  three years after my marriage I was in London, and Fred and I were very, very poor,  for his aunt hadn&rsquo;t then forgiven him for making a cat&rsquo;s-paw of her at Lausanne,  and he had no remittances from her, and nothing but his pay, and an occasional present  from Louisa, who married a rich city man soon after our elopement. I had had one  baby, a little girl, who was then a year and a half old, and who was christened  after Fred&rsquo;s rich aunt; and Fred&rsquo;s regiment was ordered out to India, and I was  getting ready to join him at Southampton, and I was very unhappy at having to take  my darling out there, for people said the climate would kill her. I was in lodgings  in the neighbourhood of Euston Square, and I was altogether very wretched, when  one evening at dusk, as I was sitting by the fire, with my little girl in my lap,  who should walk into the room but the very man I had jilted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave  a scream when I saw him, but he begged me not to be frightened of him; and then  I asked him if he had forgiven me. He said he had tried to forgive me. He was very  grave and quiet; but though I think he tried to be gentle, there was a sort of suppressed  sternness in his manner which made me feel afraid of him. He had not very long returned  from the East, he said, and he was very lonely and wretched. He had heard from my  father that I was going to India,  and that I had a little girl, whom I was obliged to take abroad with me for want  of the means of providing her with a comfortable home in England. He proposed to me to adopt  this little girl, and to bring her up as his own daughter, with my husband&rsquo;s consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  promised to leave her very well off at his death, and to give her a fortune if he  lived to see her married. He would be most likely, he said, to leave her all his  money; but he made it a condition that neither I nor her father should have any  further claim upon her. We were to give her up altogether, and were to be satisfied  with hearing of her from time to time, through him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a lonely man,  Mrs. Lennard,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;even my wealth is a burden to me. My life is purposeless  and empty. I have no incentive to labour&mdash;nothing to love or to protect. Let me have  your little girl; I shall be a better father to her than your husband can be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At  first I thought that I could never, never consent to such a thing; but little by  little he won me over, in a grave, persuasive way, that convinced me in spite of  myself, and I couldn&rsquo;t afford to engage a nurse to go out to Calcutta with me, and  I&rsquo;d advertised for an ayah who wanted to return, and who would go with me for the  consideration of her passage-money, but there had been no answers to my advertisements;  so at last I consented to write to Fred to ask him if he would agree to our parting  with the pet. Fred wrote me the shortest of letters by return of post; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he  said, &lsquo;the child would be an awful nuisance on shipboard, and it will be much better  for her to stop in England.&rsquo;  I sent his letter to the lawyer, and the next day he brought a nurse, a respectable  elderly person, and fetched away my precious darling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  see, Miss Villars, neither Fred nor I had <em>realised</em> the idea that we were  parting with her for ever; we only thought of the convenience of getting her a happy  home in England for nothing,  while we went to be broiled to death&rsquo;s door out in India. But, ah, when years and years  passed by, and the two babies who were born in India died, I began to grieve dreadfully  about my lost pet; and if I hadn&rsquo;t been what some people call frivolous, and if  Fred and I hadn&rsquo;t suited each other so exactly, and been somehow or other always  happy together in all our troubles, I think I should have broken my heart. But I  try to be resigned,&rdquo; concluded Mrs. Lennard, with a profound sigh, &ldquo;and I hear <em>of</em> my pet once in six months or so, though I never hear from her, and indeed I doubt  if she knows she&rsquo;s got such a thing as a Mama in the universe&mdash;and I have her portrait,  poor darling, and she&rsquo;s very like what I was twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  she is,&rdquo; Eleanor answered gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know she is! You know her, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear Mrs. Lennard. Very strange things happen in this world, and not the least strange  is the circumstance which has brought you and me together. I know your daughter  intimately. Her name is Laura, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Laura Mason Lennard, after Fred&rsquo;s rich aunt, Laura Mason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  your maiden name was Margaret Ravenshaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good  gracious me, yes!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lennard. &ldquo;Why you seem to know everything about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  this much,&mdash;the man you jilted was Gilbert Monckton, of Tolldale Priory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course! Tolldale was poor Papa&rsquo;s place till he sold it to Mr. Monckton. Oh, Miss  Villars, if you know him, how you must despise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wonder that you could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  stopped abruptly: the termination of her speech would not have been very complimentary  to the good-tempered Major. Mrs. Lennard understood that sudden pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  what you were going to say, Miss Villars. You were going to say you wondered how  I could prefer Fred to Gilbert Monckton; and I&rsquo;m not a bit offended. I know as well  as you do that Mr. Monckton is very, very, very  superior to Frederick  in intellect, and dignity, and elegance, and all manner of things. But then, you  see,&rdquo; added Mrs. Lennard, with a pleading smile, &ldquo;Fred <em>suited me</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter54"></a>Chapter 54<br>
  Very Lonely</strong></h2>
<p>Eleanor had considerable difficulty in parrying Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s  questions as to how she had come to know Gilbert Monckton and his ward; and she  was obliged to confess that she had been musical governess to Laura at Hazlewood.  &ldquo;But I must beg you not to tell Mr. Monckton that I am with you, if you should happen  to write to him,&rdquo; Eleanor said; &ldquo;I have a very particular reason for wishing him  to remain in perfect ignorance of my present home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  be sure, my dear,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Lennard; &ldquo;of course I won&rsquo;t tell him if you don&rsquo;t  wish me to do so. And as to writing to him, I should no more think of doing so than  of flying in the air, except just a civil note of a few lines to thank him for sending  me news of Laura. He only writes to me once in six months or so, to tell me how  my lost darling is, and though I&rsquo;ve implored him again and again he won&rsquo;t let me  see her. &lsquo;She is still little more than a child,&rsquo; he wrote in his last letter, &lsquo;and  I dread the effect of your influence upon her. It is out of no revengeful feeling  that I keep your daughter apart from you. When her character is formed and her principles  fixed, you shall know her.&rsquo; As if I was a wretch!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lennard in conclusion,  &ldquo;and should contaminate my own daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  smiled as she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear  Mrs. Lennard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;your daughter is perhaps better off in the care of such  a man as Gilbert Monckton. She is as kind-hearted and good-tempered as yourself,  but she is rather weak, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;m weak, too. Yes, I quite understand you, Miss Villars. It is my misfortune to  be weak-minded. I can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to people. The arguments of the person who talks  to me last always seem so much stronger than those of the person who talked to me  first. I take impressions quickly, and don&rsquo;t take them deeply. I was touched to  the heart by Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s kindness to my father, and I meant to marry him  as I promised, and to be his true and obedient wife; and then when that poor silly  Fred came all the way to Lausanne, and went on so about being ill-used and deserted,  and wanted to commit suicide, I thought it was my duty to run away with Fred. I  haven&rsquo;t any opinions of my own you see, and I&rsquo;m always ready to be influenced by  the opinions of other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  thought long and deeply over the story she had heard from Mrs. Lennard. This was  the root of all Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s suspicions. He had been deceived, most cruelly,  most unexpectedly, by a beautiful, childish creature in whose innocence he had implicitly  believed. He had been fooled and hood-winked by a fair-haired angel whose candid  azure eyes that seemed to beam upon him with all the brightness of truth. He had  been deceived most egregiously, but he had not been deliberately betrayed; for up  to the time of her treacherous desertion of her affianced lover, Margaret Ravenshaw  had meant to be true to him. Unhappily Gilbert Monckton did not know this. It is  difficult for the man who finds himself as cruelly jilted as he had been, not to  believe that the false one has intended all along to turn traitor at the last. There  had been no explanation between Margaret and the lawyer; and he was entirely ignorant  of the manner of her flight. He only knew that she had left him; without a word  to prepare him for the death-blow, without a line of regretful farewell to make  his sorrow lighter to him. The frivolous, shallow woman had been unable to fathom  the depth of the strong man&rsquo;s love. Margaret Ravenshaw knew there was very little  of the divine in her own nature, and she had never expected to inspire the mighty  affection of a grand and noble soul. She was able to understand the love of Frederick  Lennard, which was demonstrated by noisy protestations, and declared itself in long,  schoolboy letters in which the young man&rsquo;s doubtful orthography was blistered by  his tears. But she could not understand the intensity of feelings that did not make  themselves visible in any stereotyped fashion.</p>
<p>Unluckily  for the harmony of creation, wise men do not always fall in love wisely. The wisest  and the best are apt to be bound captive by some external charm, which they think  must be the outward evidence of an inward grace; and Gilbert Monckton had loved  this frivolous, capricious girl as truly as if she had been the noblest and greatest  of womankind. So the blow that had fallen upon him was a very heavy one; and its  most fatal effect was to transform a confiding nature into a suspicious one.</p>
<p>He argued  as many men argue under the same circumstances. He had been deceived by one woman, <em>ergo</em>, all women were capable of deception. I don&rsquo;t suppose the &ldquo;Stranger&rdquo;  placed very much confidence in the Countess, or had by any means too high an opinion  of Charlotte; and  the best of men are apt to feel very much after the manner of Mrs. Haller&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>It seemed  very strange to Eleanor to be living with Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s first love. It was  almost as if some one had arisen out of the grave; for she had looked upon that  old story which she had heard hinted at by the Hazlewood gossips, as something so  entirely belonging to the past, that the heroine of the romance must of necessity  be dead.</p>
<p>And  here she was, alive and merry, knowing no greater uneasiness than a vague dread  of increasing plumpness, induced by French dinners. Here she was, the very reverse  of the image that Eleanor had conjured up in her mind in association with Gilbert&rsquo;s  false love; a good-tempered, common-place, pretty, middle-aged woman. Mrs. Monckton  felt a little pang of jealousy at the thought that her husband had once loved this  woman so dearly. Her husband! Had she still the right to call him by that name?  Had he not severed the link between them of his own free will? Had he not outraged  her honour, insulted her truth by his base and unfounded suspicions? Yes! he had  done all this, and yet Eleanor loved him! She knew the strength of her love now  that she was away from him, and might perhaps never see his face looking at her  in kindness again. She knew it now that her scheme of vengeance against Launcelot  Darrell had failed, and left a great blank in her mind. She thought of her husband  seriously now for the first time, and she knew that she loved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard  was right,&rdquo; she thought again and again; &ldquo;the purpose of my life was cruel and unwomanly.  I had no right to marry Gilbert Monckton while my mind was full of angry thoughts.  Richard was right. My poor father&rsquo;s rest would be no more peaceful if I had made  Launcelot Darrell pay the penalty of his wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  did not abandon her idea of vengeance all at once; but little by little, by very  slow degrees, her mind became reconciled to the idea that she had failed in her  scheme of retribution, and that there was nothing left her but to try and justify  herself in the sight of the husband she loved.</p>
<p>She  loved him; and the angry feelings which had prompted her to run away from Tolldale  Priory, willingly abandoning all claim to his name and his protection, were beginning  to give way now. Mrs. Lennard&rsquo;s story had thrown new light upon the past, and Eleanor  made all kinds of excuses for her husband&rsquo;s conduct. It was his habit to bear all  sorrows quietly. Who could tell what anguish he might have felt in the thought of  his young wife&rsquo;s falsehood?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  would not pursue Margaret Ravenshaw,&rdquo; Eleanor thought, &ldquo;and he makes no attempt  to find me. And yet he may love me as truly as he loved her. Surely if God refused  to hear my prayers for revenge, He will grant me the power to justify myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  could only blindly hope for some unknown chance that might bring about her justification;  and that chance would perhaps never come. She was very unhappy when she thought  of this; and it was only the perpetual confusion in which Major Lennard and his  wife contrived to keep everybody belonging to them, that saved her from suffering  very cruelly.</p>
<p>All  this time she was quite ignorant of the appearance of an advertisement which had  been repeated at the top of the second column of the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; supplement every day  for nearly a month, and about which idle people hazarded all manner of conjectures&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">ELEANOR, come back. I was rash and cruel. I will trust you.G. M.</p>
<p>Major  Lennard was in the habit of seeing the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; every day at Galignani&rsquo;s; but, as  he was not a very acute observer or original thinker, he took no notice of the repetition  of this advertisement beyond an occasional &ldquo;By Jove! Haw! that poor dayv&rsquo;l&rsquo;s still  advertising for El&rsquo;ner!&rdquo; nor did he ever make any allusion to the circumstance in  his domestic circle.</p>
<p>So Eleanor  hugged her sorrows secretly in the gayest city of the world, while Gilbert Monckton  was rushing hither and thither, and breaking his heart about his lost wife.</p>
<p>I think  that pitying angels must sometimes weep over the useless torments, the unnecessary  anguish, which foolish mortals inflict upon themselves.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter55"></a>Chapter 55<br>
  Victor Bourdon Goes Over To The Enemy</strong></h2>
<p>Major and Mrs. Lennard and Eleanor Monckton had stayed for nearly  two months at the H&ocirc;tel du Palais. April was fast melting into May, and the atmosphere  in the City of Boulevards was very different to the chilling air of an English spring.  Miniature strawberries were exposed in the windows of the cheap restaurants in the  Palais Royal, side by side with monstrous asparagus, and green peas from Algeria;  until the mind of the insular-bred stranger grew confused as to the succession of  the months, and was beguiled into thinking that May must be omitted in the French  almanack, and that capricious April skipped away in a farewell shower to give place  at once to glowing June.</p>
<p>It was  difficult for a thorough-bred Briton to believe that the F&ecirc;te of the First Napoleon  had not yet come to set the fountains playing at Versailles: for the asphalte on  the Boulevards was unpleasantly warm, under one&rsquo;s boots; airily-attired ladies were  lounging upon the chairs in the gardens of the Tuileries; only the most fragile  and vaporous bonnets were to be seen in the Bois de Boulogne; vanille and strawberry  ices were in constant demand at Tortoni&rsquo;s; idle Parisians spent the dusky spring  evenings seated outside the lighted caf&eacute;s, drinking iced lemonade; and a hundred  other signs and tokens bore witness that the summer had come.</p>
<p>Upon  one of these very warm April days, Major Lennard insisted upon taking his wife and  her companion to dine at a restaurant not very far from the Bourse; where the pastorally-inclined  epicure could take his dinner in a garden, a pleasant quadrangle, festooned with  gay blossoms, and musical with the ripple of a fountain. Eleanor did not often accompany  the Major and his wife in their pleasure excursions, the culminating attraction  of which was generally a dinner; but this time Major Lennard insisted upon her joining  them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the last dinner I shall give Meg in Paris,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;for we must start for Brussels  on Saturday, and I mean it to be a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  submitted, for her new friends had been very kind to her, and she had no motive  for opposing their wishes. It was much better for her to be with them in any scene  of gaiety, however hollow and false that gaiety might be, than alone in the splendid  salon at the H&ocirc;tel du Palais, brooding over her troubles in the dusky twilight,  and thinking of the horrible night on which she had watched for her father&rsquo;s coming  in the Rue de l&rsquo;Archev&ecirc;que.</p>
<p>The  restaurant near the Place de la Bourse was very much crowded upon this sunny April  afternoon, and there was only one table vacant when the Major and his party entered  the flowery little quadrangle, where the rippling of the fountain was unheard amidst  the clattering of plates and the chinking of silver forks. It was seven o&rsquo;clock,  and the dinners were in high progress; the diners eating very fast, and talking  a great deal faster.</p>
<p>The  little arbour-like box to which Major Lennard conducted the two ladies was next  to a similar arbour, in which there was a group of Frenchmen. Eleanor sat with her  back to these men, who had very nearly finished dining, and who, from the style  of their conversation, appeared to have taken plenty of wine. The man who was evidently  the entertainer sat with his legs amongst a forest of empty bottles; and the jingling  of glasses and the &ldquo;cloop&rdquo; of newly-drawn corks drowned a good deal of the conversation.</p>
<p>It was  not very likely that Eleanor would listen to these men&rsquo;s talk; or indeed, distinguish  one voice from another, or one word from another amid the noise of the crowded garden.  She had quite enough to do to attend to Mrs. Lennard, who chattered all dinner time,  keeping up an uninterrupted babble, in which remarks upon the business of the dinner-table  were blended with criticism upon the dress of ladies sitting in the other boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  should eat those little red things&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;baby-lobsters&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;&eacute;crivisses, I think they call  them, dear; I always do. How do you like that bonnet; no, not that one&mdash;a little  more St. Jacques, Major,&mdash;the black one, with the peach-coloured strings. I wonder  why they call all the Clarets saints, and not the Burgundies? Do you think she&rsquo;s  pretty in the box opposite? No, you don&rsquo;t think much of her, do you?&mdash;<em>I</em> don&rsquo;t&mdash;I  like the one in the blue silk, pretty well, if her eyebrows weren&rsquo;t so heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  dinner was drawing to a close, the Major was up to his eyes in roast fowl and water-cress,  and Mrs. Lennard was scraping the preserved fruit out of a shellwork of heavy pastry  with the point of her spoon, trifling idly now that the grand business was done,  when Eleanor rose suddenly from her seat, breathless and eager, as much startled  by the sound of a voice in the next arbour as if a shell had just exploded amidst  the debris of the dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After?&rdquo;  some one had said interrogatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After,&rdquo;  answered a man whose voice had grown hoarser and thicker, as the empty bottles about  the legs of the president had become more numerous, &ldquo;my stripling has refused me  a little bank-note of a thousand francs. Thou art too dear, my friend, he has said  to me; <em>that</em> has been paid already, and enough largely. Besides, <em>that</em> was not great things. Ah! ha! I said, thou art there, my drole; you begin to fatigue  yourself of your confederate. He is too much. Very well; he has his pride, he also.  Thou art the last of men, and I say to you, adieu, Monsieur Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was the name that struck upon Eleanor&rsquo;s ear, and aroused the old feeling in all  its strength. The snake had only been scotched after all. It reared its head at  the sound of that name like a war-horse at the blast of a trumpet. Eleanor, starting  to her feet, turned round and faced the party in the next box. The man who had spoken  had risen also, and was leaning across the table to reach a bottle on the other  side. Thus it was that the faces of the two were opposite to each other; and Victor  Bourdon, the commercial traveller, recognised Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s missing wife.</p>
<p>He dropped  the glass that he was filling, and poured some wine into the cuff of his coat, while  he stared at Eleanor in drunken surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are here, madame?&rdquo; he cried, with a look in which astonishment was blended with  intense delight, a sort of tipsy radiance that illuminated the Frenchman&rsquo;s fat face.  Even in the midst of her surprise at seeing him, Eleanor perceived that blending  of expression, and wondered at it.</p>
<p>Before  she could speak, Monsieur Bourdon had left his party and had deliberately seated  himself in the empty chair next her. He seized her hand in both his own, and bent  over her as she shrunk away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  not recoil from me, madame,&rdquo; he said, always speaking in French that was considerably  disguised by wine. &ldquo;Ah, you do not know. I can be of the last service to you; and  you can be of the last service to me also. I have embroiled myself with this Monsieur  Long&mdash;cel&mdash;lotte, for always; after that which I have done for him, he is an ingrate,  he is less than that;&rdquo; Monsieur Bourdon struck the nail of his thumb upon his front  tooth with a gesture of ineffable contempt. &ldquo;But why do I tell you this, madame?  You were in the garden when this poor old,&mdash;this Monsieur de Crespigny, was lying  dead. You remember; you know. Never mind, I lose myself the head; I have dined a  little generously. Will you find yourself to-morrow, madame, in the gardens of the  Palais Royal, at five hours? There is music all the Tuesdays. Will you meet me?  I have something of the last importance to tell you. Remember you that I know everything.  I know that you hate this Long&mdash;cellotte. I will give you your revenge. You will  come; is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Eleanor answered, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon  the five hours? I shall wait for you near to the fountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur  Bourdon rose, took up his hat with a drunken flourish, and went back to his friends.  The Major and Mrs. Lennard had been all this time staring aghast at the drunken  Frenchman. He had spoken in a loud whisper to Eleanor, but neither Frederick Lennard  nor his wife retained very much of that French which had been sedulously drilled  into them during their school-days, and beyond ordering a dinner, or disputing with  a landlord as to the unconscionable number of wax candles in a month&rsquo;s hotel bill,  their knowledge of the language was very limited; so Eleanor had only to explain  to her friends that Monsieur Bourdon was a person whom she had known in England,  and that he had brought her some news of importance which she was to hear the following  day in the gardens of the Palais Royal.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Lennard, who was the soul of good-nature, readily assented to accompany Eleanor  to this rendezvous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course I&rsquo;ll go, my dear, with pleasure; and really I think it&rsquo;s quite funny, and  indeed actually romantic, to go and meet a tipsy Frenchman&mdash;at least, of course he  won&rsquo;t be tipsy to-day&mdash;near a fountain, and it reminds me of a French novel I read  once, in English, which shows how true it must have been to foreign manners; but  as the Major knows we&rsquo;re going, there&rsquo;s no harm, you know,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard remarked,  as they walked from the H&ocirc;tel du Palais to the gardens. The diners were hard at  work already at the cheap restaurants, and the brass band was braying lively melodies  amidst the dusty trees and flowers, the lukewarm fountain, the children, the nursemaids,  and the rather seedy-looking Parisian loungers. It was a quarter past five, for  Mrs. Lennard had mislaid her parasol at the last moment, and there had been ten  minutes employed in skirmish and search. Monsieur Victor Bourdon was sitting upon  a bench near the fountain, but he rose and darted forward as the two ladies approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go and look in the jewellers&rsquo; shops, Miss Villars,&rdquo; Mrs. Lennard said, &ldquo;while you&rsquo;re  talking to your friend, and please come and look for me when you want me. The Major  is to join us here, you know, at half-past six, and we&rsquo;re to dine at V&eacute;fours. <em>Good</em> morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Lennard bestowed these final words upon the Frenchman, accompanied by a graceful  curtsey, and departed. Victor Bourdon pointed to the bench which he had just left,  and Eleanor sat down. The Frenchman seated himself next her, but at a respectful  distance. Every trace of the tipsy excitement of the previous night had vanished.  He was quite cool to-day; and there was a certain look of determination about his  mouth, and a cold glitter in his light, greenish-grey eyes that did not promise  well for any one against whom he might bear a grudge.</p>
<p>He spoke  English to-day. He spoke it remarkably well, with only an occasional French locution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo;  he began, &ldquo;I shall not waste time, but come at once to the point. You hate Launcelot  Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  hesitated. There is something terrible in that word &ldquo;hate,&rdquo; People entertain the  deadly sentiment; but they shrink from its plain expression. The naked word is too  appalling. It is half-sister of murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have  good reason to dislike him&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>The  Frenchman shrugged his shoulders as he interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  you hate him!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you do not like to say so, because the word is not nice.  You are&mdash;what is it you call it?&mdash;you are <em>shocked</em> by the word. But it is so,  nevertheless; you hate him, and you have cause to hate him. Yes, I know now who  you are. I did not know when I first saw you in Berkshire;  but I know now. Launcelot Darrell is one who cannot keep a secret, and he has told  me. You are the daughter of that poor old man who killed himself in the Faubourg  Saint Antoine, that is enough! You are a great heart; you would to avenge the death  of your father. You saw us that night&mdash;the night the wills were change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo;  Eleanor answered, looking at the man with sovereign contempt. He had spoken of the  transaction as coolly as if it had been the most honourable and common-place business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are there in the darkness, and you see us,&rdquo; exclaimed Monsieur Bourdon, bending  over Eleanor and speaking in a confidential whisper, &ldquo;you watch, you look, you listen,  and after, when you go into the-house, you denounce Launcelot. You declare the will  is forge. The will is change. You were witness, you say; you tell all that you saw!  But they do not believe you. But why? Because when you say you have the true will  in your pocket, you cannot find it; it is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Frenchman said this in a tone of triumph, and then paused suddenly, looking earnestly  at Eleanor.</p>
<p>As she  returned that look, a new light flashed upon her mind. She began to understand the  mystery of the lost will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is gone,&rdquo; cried Monsieur Bourdon, &ldquo;no trace, no vestige of it remains. You say,  search the garden; the garden is search; but no result. Then the despair seizes  itself of you. Launcelot mocks himself of you; he laughs at your nose. You find  yourself unhappy; they do not believe you; they look coldly at you; they are harsh  to you, and you fly from them. That is so; is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Eleanor answered.</p>
<p>Her  breath came and went quickly, she never removed her eyes from the man&rsquo;s face. She  began to think that her justification was perhaps only to be obtained by the agency  of this disreputable Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  then of the lost will? It was not swallowed up by the earth. It could not fly itself  away into the space! What became of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took it  from me!&rdquo; cried Eleanor. &ldquo;Yes, I remember how closely you brushed  against me. The paper was too big to go altogether into the pocket of my dress.  The ends were sticking out, and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did  all my possible to teach you a lesson! Ah, when young and beautiful ladies mix themselves  with such matters, it is no wonder they make mistakes. I was watching you all the  time, dear madame. I saw you change the papers, and I drew the will out of your  pocket as easily as I could rob you of that handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  corner of a lace-bordered handkerchief was visible amid the folds of Eleanor&rsquo;s dress.  The Frenchman took the scrap of lace between his fingers, and snatched the handkerchief  away with an airy lightness of touch that might have done credit to a professional  adept in the art of picking pockets. He laughed as he returned the handkerchief  to Eleanor. She scarcely noticed the action, so deeply was she absorbed in the thought  of the missing will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have the will, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si,  madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  did you take it from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  why, madame? For many reasons. First, because it is always good to seize upon anything  that other people do not know how to keep. Again, because it is always well to have  a strong hand, and a card that one&rsquo;s adversary does not know of. An extra king in  one&rsquo;s coat-cuff is a good thing to have when one plays &eacute;cart&eacute;, madame. That will  is my extra king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Frenchman was silent for some little time after having made what he evidently considered  rather a startling <em>coup</em>. He sat watching Eleanor with a sidelong glance,  and with a cunning twinkle in his small eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  it that we are to be friends and allies, madame?&rdquo; he asked, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends!&rdquo;  cried Eleanor. &ldquo;Do you forget who I am? Do you forget whose daughter I am? If Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s was the only name written in my father&rsquo;s last letter, you were not the  less an accomplice in the villany that led to his death. The pupil was no doubt  worthy of the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  reject my friendship, then, madame? You wish to know nothing of the document that  is in my hands? You treat me from high to low? You refuse to ally yourself with  me? Hein?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will  use you as an instrument against Launcelot Darrell, if you please,&rdquo; Eleanor answered,  &ldquo;since it seems that you have quarrelled with your fast friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  yes, madame. When pussy has pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, she is henceforward  the most unuseful of animals, and they chase her. Do you understand, madame?&rdquo; cried  the Frenchman, with a sudden transformation from the monkey to the tiger phase of  his character, that was scarcely agreeable. &ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Monsieur  Launcelot has ennuied himself of me. I am chased! Me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struck  his gloved fingers upon his breast to give emphasis to this last word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is of the last <em>canaille</em>, this young man,&rdquo; he continued, with a shrug of disgust.  &ldquo;Ingrate, poltroon, scoundrel! When the forge will, forge at my suggestion by the  clerk of the avou&eacute; de Vindsor, has been read, and all is finish, and no one dispute  his possession, and he enter his new domain as master, the real nature of the man  reveal itself. The <em>genuine</em> will is burn, he think. He is so close with his  dear friend, this poor Bourdon, that he will not even tell him who would have benefit  by that genuine will. It is burn! Did he not see it scorch and blaze with his own  eyes? There is nothing to fear; and for this poor comrade who has helped my gentleman  to a great fortune, he is less than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur  Bourdon snapped his fingers derisively, and stared fiercely at Eleanor. Then he  relapsed into a sardonic smile, and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At  first things go on charmingly. Monsieur Launcelot is more sweet than the honey.  It is new to him to be rich, and for the first month he scatters his money with  full hands. Then suddenly he stops. He cries out that he is on the road to ruin;  that his friend&rsquo;s claims are monstrous. Faith of a gentleman, I was, perhaps, extravagant;  for I am a little gamester, and I like to see life <em>en grand seigneur</em>. <em>A  bas la moutarde</em>, I said. My friend is <em>millionaire</em>. I am no more commercial  traveller. Imagine, then, when mon gar&ccedil;on shuts up his&mdash;what is it you call it, then&mdash;cheque-book,  and refuse me a paltry sum of a thousand francs. I smile in his face,&rdquo; said Monsieur  Bourdon, nodding his head slowly, with half-closed eyes, &ldquo;and I say, &lsquo;Bon jour,  Monsieur Darrell; you shall hear more of me before I am much older.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  did not tell him that the will was in your possession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand  thunders! No!&rdquo; exclaimed the Frenchman. &ldquo;I was not so much foolish as to show him  the beneath the cards. I come over here to consult a friend, an avou&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  he tells you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  matter. You are better than the avou&eacute;, madame. You hate Launcelot Darrell; this  will is all you want to prove him a cheat and a blacksmith,&mdash;pardon, a forger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  to whom does M. de Crespigny leave his estate in this genuine will?&rdquo; asked Mrs.  Monckton.</p>
<p>The  Frenchman smiled, and looked at Eleanor thoughtfully for a moment before he answered  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait  a little, madame,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that is my little secret. Nothing for nothing is the  rule here below. I have told you too much already. If you want to know more you  must pay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prove  that I spoke the truth upon that night,&rdquo; exclaimed Eleanor, &ldquo;and I promise you that  my husband, Gilbert Monckton, shall reward you handsomely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  if monsieur should repudiate your promise, madame, since he has not authorised you  to give it? I am not very wise in your English law, and I would rather not mix myself  in this affair. I do not want to be produced as witness or accomplice. I want, all  simply, to get a price for this document. I have something to sell. You wish to  buy it. Name your price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo;  answered Eleanor; &ldquo;I have no money. But I might get some, perhaps. Tell me, how  much do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand  pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  shook her head despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;  she said; &ldquo;there is no one, except my husband, from whom I could get such an amount,  and I could not ask him for money, until I had proved Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s infamy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Frenchman watched her closely. He saw that she had spoken the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  do not know how much this will is worth to you, madame,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember, I could  make terms with Launcelot Darrell, and sell it to him for perhaps ten times the  sum I ask of you. But Monsieur Darrell was insolent to me; he struck me once with  the butt-end of his hunting-whip; I do not forget. I could get more money from him;  but I can get my revenge through you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hissed  out these words between his teeth, and glared vindictively at the fountain, as if  the phantom of Launcelot Darrell had been looking at him out of the sparkling water-drops.  Revenge was not a beautiful thing, as represented by Victor Bourdon. Perhaps Eleanor  may have thought of this as she looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want  my revenge,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;after all, gold is a villain thing. Revenge is more dear&mdash;to  gentlemen. Besides, I do not think you would pay me ungenerously if I helped you  to crush this scoundrel, and helped you to something else, by the market, Hein?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell  you again, that you shall be well rewarded,&rdquo; Mrs. Monckton said gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, listen to me. It is to-day, Tuesday. In a week I shall have time to  think. In a week you will have leisure to gather together a little money&mdash;all you  can get; at the end of that time come to me at my apartment&mdash;bring with you any friend  you like. I do not think that you are traitor&mdash;or ingrate&mdash;and you see I trust you.  I will have my friend, the&mdash;what you call him&mdash;attorney, with me&mdash;and we may come to  an arrangement. You shall sign a contract&mdash;well ruled&mdash;for to pay me in the future,  and then the will is to you. You return to England; you say, Aha, Monsieur Launcelot,  walk out of that. It is your turn to be chased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor  Bourdon grinned ferociously, then took a memorandum-book from his pocket, wrote  a few words in pencil, tore out the leaf upon which they were written, and handed  it to Mrs. Monckton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  is my address,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On Tuesday, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, I shall expect  to see you there, and your friend. But if you think to betray me, I am not the man  to forget. I have the honour to salute you, Madame. <em>Bon jour</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took  off his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Eleanor sat for some minutes where  he had left her, thinking over what had happened, before she went off to look for  Mrs. Lennard.</p>
<p>That  night she told the Lennards who she was, and all her story. She felt that it was  better to do so. She must have freedom now to act, and to act promptly. She could  not do this and yet preserve her secret. Her old ally, Richard Thornton, would be  indispensable to her in this crisis, and she wrote to him early in the morning after  her interview with Monsieur Bourdon, imploring him to come to her immediately.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter56"></a>Chapter 56<br>
  The Horrors Of Delirium Tremens.</strong></h2>
<p>No letter came from Richard Thornton. Eleanor was seized with a kind of panic  as the days went by, and there was no answer from the young man, the faithful friend,  without whose help she felt herself so powerless.</p>
<p>Eleanor  had addressed her letter to the Pilasters, enclosed in an envelope directed to Signora  Picirillo, with a few hurried lines requesting that it might be immediately forwarded  to the scene-painter. He was in Scotland  still, very likely, and some days must elapse before he could respond to Eleanor&rsquo;s  summons. She felt assured that he would come to her. There are some friends whose  goodness we no more doubt than we doubt the power of God; and Richard Thornton was  one of these.</p>
<p>But  the week passed, and no reply came to Eleanor&rsquo;s appeal for help, so she began to  feel that she stood alone, and must act for herself. She must act for herself, since  to think of getting any assistance from either the major or his wife in this business,  which demanded foresight, coolness, and diplomacy, would have been about as reasonable  as to apply to one of the children playing under the trees in the gardens of the  Tuileries.</p>
<p>As far  as sympathy went, Major and Mrs. Lennard were all that the most exacting individual  could require. The major offered to do anything in a muscular way on behalf of his  wife&rsquo;s friend. Should he punch the head of that scoundrelly Frenchman? Should he  go over to England and horsewhip Launcelot Darrell, and bring Gilbert Monckton to  reason, and play up old gooseberry altogether? This good-natured Hercules was ready  to hit out right and left in the defence of poor Eleanor.</p>
<p>But  the one friend whom Mrs. Monckton wanted in this crisis was Richard Thornton&mdash;Richard,  the clear-sighted, even-tempered, unprejudiced young man, who was ready to go through  fire and water for the sake of his beautiful adopted sister, without noise or bluster;  and when the Tuesday, the day appointed by the Frenchman for Eleanor&rsquo;s visit to  his apartments, came, and Richard Thornton did not come with it, the lonely girl  almost gave way to despair.</p>
<p>She  felt that she had to encounter a wretch who was utterly without honour or honesty,  and who, seeing the value which she set upon the possession of Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s  will, would be all the more exacting in his demands. And she had nothing to bribe  him with; nothing.</p>
<p>She  had been too proud to appeal to her husband; for ever impulsive, for ever inconsiderate,  she had not stopped to think that he of all others was the most fitting person to  stand by her in this crisis. At first the thought of writing to Gilbert Monckton  had indeed flashed across her mind, but in the next moment she had remembered the  bitter humiliation of her last failure.</p>
<p>She  could not endure another such degradation; and she had seen treachery and dishonour  so long triumph over the simple force of truth, that she had begun to think that  wrong was stronger than right, and always must be victorious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I were to write and ask Gilbert to come to me, this Frenchman would perhaps disappear  before my husband could arrive; or he would be afraid of Gilbert, very likely, and  would deny any knowledge of the will; and I should appear a convicted trickster,  who had heaped up one falsehood upon another, in the weak attempt to justify herself.  No. Gilbert Monckton shall hear nothing of me until I can go to him with Maurice  de Crespigny&rsquo;s will in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  in the meantime this helpless girl&rsquo;s anxiety grew every hour more intense. What  reliance could she place upon the words of the Frenchman? She had encountered him  while he was still smarting under the sense of his wrongs, and in that stage of  his feelings, revenge had seemed even sweeter to him than gain. But this state of  things might not endure very long. The commercial traveller might listen to the  dictates of reason rather than to the fiery promptings of passion, and might begin  to think that a substantial recompense in the shape of money was better than any  sugar-plum in the way of revenge. He had said that Launcelot Darrell would be willing  to give him ten times a thousand pounds for the genuine will. What more likely than  that Monsieur Victor Bourdon should have thought better of his original design,  and opened negotiations with the new master of Woodlands!</p>
<p>Monsieur  Bourdon would in all probability have done precisely this, had he not been hindered  by one of those unlooked-for and purely providential circumstances which so often  help single and simple-minded truth in her encounters with versatile and shifty  falsehood.</p>
<p>At half-past  six o&rsquo;clock upon the appointed evening, Eleanor Monckton left the H&ocirc;tel du Palais,  escorted by Major Lennard, on her way to the Frenchman&rsquo;s lodging. She had waited  until the last moment in the hope of Richard Thornton&rsquo;s arrival, but he had not  come; and she had been fain to accept the aid of this good-natured overgrown schoolboy,  who still persisted that the immediate punching of Victor Bourdon&rsquo;s head would be  the best and surest means of getting possession of the will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  me punch the feller&rsquo;s head, Miss Vil&mdash;beg pardon, Mrs. Monckton. The idea of your  being married to old Monckton! He ain&rsquo;t any older than me, you know, but I always  call him old Monckton. Let me punch this dam Frenchman&rsquo;s head; that&rsquo;ll bring the  feller to book in next to no time, and then we can do what we like with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Eleanor impressed upon her stalwart protector that there must be no muscular demonstration,  and that the conduct of the interview was to be left entirely to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  in the least hope that he&rsquo;ll give up the will without a bribe,&rdquo; Eleanor said; &ldquo;he  is the last man upon earth to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you what, then, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; exclaimed the major, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any <em>ready</em> money. I never have had, since I borrowed sixpences of a sucking bill-discounter  at the first school I ever went to; but I&rsquo;ll give you my acceptance. Let this fellow  draw upon me for a thousand at three months, and give up the document for that consideration.  Monckton will enable me to meet the bill, no doubt, when he finds I was of service  to you in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  looked at the major with a gleam of hope in her face. But that transient gleam very  quickly faded. She had only a vague idea of the nature and properties of accommodation  bills; but she had a very positive notion of Victor Bourdon&rsquo;s character, and, though  this plan <em>sounded</em> feasible enough, she did not think it would succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are very good to me, Major Lennard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and believe me I appreciate your  kindness; but I do not think that this Frenchman will consent to take anything but  ready money. He could get that from Launcelot Darrell, remember, at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s  only hope was the one chance that she might induce Victor Bourdon to accept her  promise of a reward from Gilbert Monckton <em>after</em> the production of the will.</p>
<p>The  neighbourhood in which the commercial traveller lived, whenever he made Paris his head-quarters, was  one of the dingiest localities in the city. Major Lennard and Eleanor, after making  numerous inquiries, and twice losing their way, found themselves at last in a long  narrow street, one side of which was chiefly dead-wall, broken here and there by  a dilapidated gateway or a dingy window. At one corner there was a shop for the  sale of unredeemed pledges; a queer old shop, in whose one murky window obsolete  scraps of jewellery,&mdash;odd watch-keys, impossible watches with cracked enamel dials  and crippled hands that pointed to hours whose last moments had passed away for  half a century; mysterious, incomprehensible garments, whose fashion was forgotten,  and whose first owners were dead and gone; poor broken-down clocks, in tawdry ormolu  cases, that had stood upon lodging-house mantelpieces, indifferently telling the  wrong time to generations of lodgers; an old guitar; a stringless violin; poor,  frail, cracked cups and saucers, that had been precious once, by reason of the lips  that had drunk out of them; a child&rsquo;s embroidered frock; a battered christening-cup;  a tattered missal; an odd volume of &ldquo;The Wandering Jew;&rdquo; amid a hundred other pitiful  relics which poverty barters for a crust of bread,&mdash;faded in the evening sunlight,  and waited for some eccentric purchaser to take a fancy to them. Next door to this  sarcophagus of the past there was an eating-house, neat and almost cheerful, where  one could have a soup, three courses, and half a bottle of wine for fivepence. The  whole neighbourhood seemed to be, somehow or other, overshadowed by churches, and  pervaded by the perpetual tramp of funerals; and, lying low and out of the way of  all cheerful traffic, was apt to have a depressing effect upon the spirits of frivolous  people.</p>
<p>Eleanor,  leading the major&mdash;who was of about as much use to her as a blind man is to his dog&mdash;succeeded  at last in finding the house which boasted Monsieur Victor Bourdon amongst its inhabitants.  I say &ldquo;amongst&rdquo; advisedly; for as there was the office of a popular bi-weekly periodical  upon the first-floor, a greengrocer in the <em>rez-de-chauss&eacute;e</em>, a hairdresser  who professed to cut and friz the hair, on the second story, and a mysterious lady,  whose calling was represented by a faded pictorial board, resident somewhere under  the roof, the commercial traveller was a very unimportant inhabitant, an insignificant  nomad, replaced to-day by a student <em>en droit</em>, to-morrow by a second-rate  actor at a fifth-rate theatre.</p>
<p>Eleanor  found this when she came to make inquiries of the portress as to the possibility  of seeing Monsieur Bourdon. This lady, who was knitting, and whose very matronly  contour made it impossible for her to see her knitting-needles, told Eleanor that  Monsieur Bourdon was very unlikely to be at home at that time. He was apt to return  late at night, upon the two hours, in effect, between two wines, and at those times  he was enough abrupt, and was evidently by no means a favourite with madame the  portress. But on looking into a dusky corner, where some keys were hanging upon  a row of rusty nails, madame informed Eleanor that Monsieur Bourdon <em>was</em> at  home, as his key was not amongst the rest, and it was his habit to leave it in her  care when he went out. The portress seemed very much struck by this discovery, for  she remarked that the last time she had seen Monsieur Bourdon go out had been early  in the morning of Sunday, and that she did not remember having seen him re-enter.</p>
<p>But  upon this a brisk young person of twelve or thirteen, who was busy getting up fine  linen in the recesses of the lodge, cried out in a very shrill voice that Monsieur  Bourdon had returned before mid-day on Sunday, looking a little ill, and dragging  himself with a fatigued air.</p>
<p>He was  at home, then, the portress exclaimed; at least, she did not utter any equivalent  to our English word home, and in that evinced considerable wisdom, since a French  lodging is a place so utterly unhomelike, that the meanest second-floor at Islington  or Chelsea, presided over by the most unconscionable of British landladies, becomes  better than all the pleasures and palaces we can roam amidst&mdash;and it is not everybody  who has the chance of roaming amidst pleasures and palaces,&mdash;by force of comparison.  Monsieur was <em>chez lui</em>, the portress said, and would madame ascend? Monsieur&rsquo;s  apartment was on the entresol, with windows giving upon the street. Madame would  see a black door facing her upon the first landing.</p>
<p>Eleanor  went up a short flight of steps, followed by the major. She knocked upon the panel  of the black door&mdash;once, twice, three times; but there was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  lay a fiver the feller&rsquo;s gone out again,&rdquo; the major exclaimed; &ldquo;that jabbering Frenchwoman  didn&rsquo;t seem to know what she was talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Eleanor knocked a fourth time, and very much louder than she had knocked before.  There was no answer even this time; but a voice was heard within, blaspheming aloud  with horrible French execrations that seemed to freeze Eleanor&rsquo;s blood as she listened  to them.</p>
<p>She  did listen to them, involuntarily, as people often listen in a crowded thoroughfare  to the obnoxious clamour of a drunken man, paralysed for the moment by the horror  of his hideous oaths.</p>
<p>Eleanor  turned very pale, and looked despairingly at the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark,&rdquo;  she whispered, &ldquo;he is quarrelling with some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  big soldier deliberately turned himself into a convenient position for listening,  and flattened his ear against the keyhole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  he ain&rsquo;t quarrellin&rsquo; with any one,&rdquo; the major said, presently. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make much  out of his lingo, but there&rsquo;s only one voice. He&rsquo;s all alone, and goin&rsquo; on like  a madman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  major opened the door softly as he spoke. Monsieur Bourdon&rsquo;s apartment was divided  into two low-roofed chambers, a little larger than comfortable pigeon-holes; and  in the inner and smaller chamber Eleanor and her companion saw the commercial traveller  wandering backwards and forwards in his obscure den, only dressed in his trowsers  and shirt, and gesticulating like a madman.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton clung to the soldier&rsquo;s arm. She had some cause for fear, for in the next  moment the Frenchman descried his visitors, and with a howl of rage, rushed at the  major&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>The  most intellectual and diplomatic individual in Christendom would have been of very  little service to Eleanor at that moment, if he had been also a coward. Major Lennard  lifted the commercial traveller in his arms, as easily as if that gentleman had  been a six-months-old baby, carried him into the next room where there was a narrow  little bedstead, flung him on to the mattrass, and held him there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  find a silk handkerchief in my pocket, my dear,&rdquo; he said to Eleanor, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll  be so kind as to pull it out. <em>Voulez-vous gardez-vous trongkeel, dong, vous</em>&mdash;Scoundrel!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, addressing himself to the struggling Frenchman.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Monckton obeyed. She fell into her place quite naturally, giving way before the  major. He was the hero of the moment. Frederic Souli&eacute; has said that the meanest  actor who ever trod the boards of a theatre, has some inspired moment in which he  is great. I fancy it must be pretty much the same in the drama of life. This was  the major&rsquo;s moment; and he arose out of his normal inanity, resplendent with unconscious  grandeur.</p>
<p>The  silk handkerchief was a large one, and Major Lennard used it very dexterously about  Monsieur Bourdon&rsquo;s wrists; then he found another handkerchief in another pocket,  and used it as a bandage for the Frenchman&rsquo;s ankles; and having done this he sat  down by the bedside and contemplated his handiwork complacently, puffing and blowing  a little while he did so.</p>
<p>Victor  Bourdon lay very still, glaring at the ponderous soldier with eyes that were like  those of a wild beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know  thee,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;thou hast been with me all the night, thou hast sat upon my  chest; ah, Gr&ecirc;din! thou art the biggest of all the demons that torment me. Thou  breathest the fire and the sulphur, and thy breath burns me, and now thou hast attached  my hands with bands of iron, white hot, and thou hast tied my ankles with living  scorpions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  stood at a few paces from the bed, listening with horror to the man&rsquo;s delirious  ravings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; she asked, in a subdued voice. &ldquo;Is it a fever that makes him like this?  Or has he gone mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  major shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think  I can guess pretty well what&rsquo;s the matter with the poor devil;&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been  going it a little too fast. He&rsquo;s got a touch of del. trem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Del trem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delirium  tremens, my dear,&rdquo; answered the major. &ldquo;Yes, you can hear his teeth chattering now  this minute. I had it once when I was up the country, and our fellers took to living  upon brandy-pawnee. I had rather a sharp time of it, while it lasted; used to fancy  the tent was on fire; wanted to go out tiger-hunting in the middle of the night;  tried to set the bed-clothes alight to cure myself of the hiccough; and ran after  Meg with a razor early one morning. This man has got a touch of it, Mrs. Monckton,  and I don&rsquo;t think we shall get much reason out of him to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  conduct of Monsieur Victor Bourdon, who was at that moment holding a very animated  discourse with a dozen or so of juvenile demons supposed to be located in the bed-curtains,  went very far towards confirming the major&rsquo;s assertion.</p>
<p>Eleanor  sat down at the little table, upon which the dirty litter of the Frenchman&rsquo;s last  meal was huddled into a heap and intermixed with writing materials; an ink-bottle  and a mustard-pot, a quill-pen and a tea-spoon, lying side by side. The girl&rsquo;s fortitude  had given way before this new and most cruel disappointment. She covered her face  with her hands, and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>Major  Lennard was very much distressed at this unexpected collapse upon the part of his  chief. He was very big, and rather stupid; but he had one of those tender childish  natures which never learn to be hard and unmerciful. He was for ever patting the  shock-heads of dirty pauper children, for ever fumbling in his pockets for copper  coin, always open to the influence of any story of womanly distress, and quite unable  to withstand the dingiest female, if she could only produce the merest phantom of  a tear to be wiped away furtively from one eye, while the other looked round the  corner to see if the shot went home.</p>
<p>He looked  piteously at Eleanor, as she sat sobbing passionately, half unconscious of his presence,  forgetful of everything except that this last hope had failed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought  that he might leave Paris,  and go back to Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; she said, in a broken voice, &ldquo;but I never thought  of anything like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-sh-sh-sh!&rdquo;  cried Monsieur Bourdon from the bed. &ldquo;Ftz! Cats, cats! Sh-sh-sh-sh! Chase those  cats, somebody! There&rsquo;s the girl Faust saw upon the Bracken with the little rat  running out of her mouth! There, sitting at the table! Go then, Voleuse, Gueuse,  Inf&acirc;me!&rdquo; screamed the Frenchman, glaring at Eleanor.</p>
<p>The  girl took no notice of him. Her sobs grew every moment louder and more hysterical.  The major looked at her helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;my good creature, don&rsquo;t now. This is really dreadful, &rsquo;pon my soul, now.  Come, come, now; cheer up, my dear, cheer up. You won&rsquo;t do anything by giving way,  you know. I always tell Margaret that, when she thinks she can catch the train by  sitting on the ground and crying, because her portmanteaus won&rsquo;t shut. Nobody ever  did you know, and if you don&rsquo;t put your shoulder to the wheel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  major might have rambled on in this wise for some time; but the sobbing grew louder;  and he felt that it was imperatively necessary that something energetic should be  done in this crisis. A bright thought flashed upon him as he looked hopelessly round  the room, and in another moment he had seized a small white crockery-ware jug from  the Frenchman&rsquo;s toilet table, and launched its contents at Eleanor&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>This  was a second master-stroke. The girl looked up with her head dripping, but with  her courage revived by the shock her senses had received.</p>
<p>She  took off her wet bonnet, and pushed the drenched hair from her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  major,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know I have been very silly. But I was so taken by surprise.  It seems so cruel that this should happen. I shall never get the will now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff  and nonsense, my dear,&rdquo; exclaimed Major Lennard. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to prevent your getting  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  to prevent your <em>taking it?</em> We&rsquo;re not going to stand upon ceremony with such  a feller as this, are we, Mrs. Monckton? He stole the will from you, and if you  can get the chance, you&rsquo;ll return the compliment by stealing it from him. Fair play&rsquo;s  a jewel, my dear Mrs. M., and nothing could be fairer than that. So we&rsquo;ll set to  work at once; and I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse the cold water, which was meant in kindness,  I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor  smiled, and gave the major her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure it was,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I scarcely liked the idea of your coming with me, major,  for fear you should do some mischief by being a little too impetuous. But I don&rsquo;t  know what I should have done without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major  Lennard shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>might</em> have been useful to you, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if the feller had been all right and  I could have punched his head; but one can&rsquo;t get any credit out of a chap when he&rsquo;s  in that state,&rdquo; added the major, pointing to the commercial traveller, who was taking  journeys on his own account into the horrible regions of an intemperate man&rsquo;s fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now  the first thing we shall want, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;is a candle and  a box of lucifers. We must have a light before we can do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was  not dark yet; but the twilight was growing greyer and greyer, and the shadows were  gathering in the corners of the room.</p>
<p>Victor  Bourdon lay glaring at his two visitors through the dusk, while the major groped  about the mantelpiece for a box of lucifers. He was not long finding what he wanted.  He struck a little waxen match against the greasy paper of the wall, and then lighted  an end of candle in a tawdry cheap china candlestick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ease  her! ease her!&rdquo; cried the Frenchman; &ldquo;I see the lights ahead off Normandy, on the side of  the wind. She&rsquo;ll strike upon a rock before we know where we are. What are they about,  these English sailors? are they blind, that they don&rsquo;t see the light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major  Lennard, with the candle in his hand, set to work to look for the missing document.  He did not look very systematically, but as he pulled out every drawer and opened  every cupboard, and shook out the contents of every receptacle, flinging them remorselessly  upon the floor, he certainly looked pretty effectually. Eleanor, kneeling on the  ground amongst the chaotic heaps of clothes and papers, tattered novels, broken  meerscham pipes and stale cigar ends, examined every pocket, every book, and every  paper separately, but with no result. The drawers had been ransacked, the cupboards  disembowelled, a couple of portmanteaus completely emptied. Every nook and corner  of the two small rooms had been most thoroughly searched, first by the major in  a slapdash and military manner; afterwards by Eleanor, who did her work with calmness  and deliberation, though her heart was beating, and the hot blood surging in her  over excited brain. Every possible hiding place in the two rooms had been examined,  but the will had not been found.</p>
<p>Every  possible hiding place had been examined; except the pockets of Victor Bourdon&rsquo;s  trousers, and the bed upon which he lay.</p>
<p>The  major stopped to scratch his head in despair, and stood staring hopelessly at the  unhappy victim of his own vices, who was still raving, still remonstrating with  invisible demons. But Eleanor aroused her friend from this state of stupefaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  may have the will about him, major,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;  cried the soldier, &ldquo;if he has, I&rsquo;ll have it out of him. Give it me, you unconscionable  blackguard,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pouncing upon the delirious Frenchman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it  out of you, you scoundrel. Tell me where it is directly. <em>Dites-moi o&ugrave; il est,  dong!</em> What have you done with it, sir? What have you done with Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s  will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  familiar name aroused a transitory gleam of consciousness in Victor Bourdon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,  ha,&rdquo; he cried with a malicious chuckle. &ldquo;Maurice de Crespigny, the old, the parent  of that Long&mdash;cellotte; but I will have my revenge; but he shall not enjoy his riches.  The will, the will; that is mine, it will give me all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised  himself by a great effort into a sitting posture, and made frantic endeavours to  disengage his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is thinking of the will,&rdquo; cried Eleanor; &ldquo;loosen his wrists, major! Pray, pray do,  before the thought leaves him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major  Lennard obeyed. He loosened the knot of the silk handkerchief, but before he could  remove it, Victor Bourdon had pulled his hands through the slackened noose, and  clutched at something in his breast. It was a folded paper which he snatched out  of the bosom of his shirt, and waved triumphantly above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha,  Monsieur Long&mdash;cellotte!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;I will pay thee for thy insolence, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  before the Frenchman&rsquo;s uplifted arm had described a second circle in the air above  his head, the major swooped down upon him, snatched away the paper, handed it to  Eleanor, and resecured Monsieur Bourdon&rsquo;s wrists with the silk handkerchief.</p>
<p>So brief  had been the interval of semi-consciousness, that the commercial traveller had already  forgotten all about Launcelot Darrell and his own wrongs, and had rambled off again  into impotent execrations against the imaginary demons amongst the bed-curtains.</p>
<p>Eleanor  unfolded the paper, but she only read the first few words, &ldquo;I, Maurice de Crespigny,  being at this time, &amp;c.,&rdquo; for before she could read more, the door of the outer  room was suddenly opened, and Richard Thornton hurried through into the bed-chamber.</p>
<p>But  not Richard only, behind him came Gilbert Monckton, and it was he into whose outstretched  arms Eleanor flung herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will believe me now, Gilbert,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have found the proof of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  guilt at last.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter57"></a>Chapter 57<br>
  Maurice De Crespigny&rsquo;s Bequest</strong></h2>
<p>Richard Thornton had received Eleanor&rsquo;s letter  in Edinburgh, and  had been travelling perpetually since his receipt of the girl&rsquo;s eager epistle. He  had calculated that by travelling day and night he should be able to accomplish  a great achievement in the four days that were to elapse between the hour in which  he received Eleanor&rsquo;s letter and the hour appointed for the interview with the Frenchman.  This achievement was the reconciliation of Gilbert Monckton and his wife.</p>
<p>For this purpose the devoted young man had travelled  from Edinburgh to London, and from London to Torquay, back to London again, with  Mr. Monckton for his companion, and from London to Paris, still in that gentleman&rsquo;s  companionship. Gilbert Monckton would have thought it a small thing to have given  half his fortune in payment of the tidings which the scene painter carried to him.</p>
<p>He should see his wife again; his bright and beautiful  young wife, whom he had so cruelly wronged, and so stupidly misunderstood.</p>
<p>Human nature is made up of contradictions. From the  hour in which Gilbert Monckton had turned his back upon Tolldale Priory, deserting  his young wife in a paroxysm of jealous anger, until now, he had done nothing but  repent of his own work. Why had he disbelieved in her? How had he been vile enough  to doubt her? Had she not stood before him, with the glorious light of truth shining  out of her beautiful face? Even had he not already repented, Eleanor&rsquo;s letter would  have opened the jealous husband&rsquo;s eyes to his own folly; that brief, offended letter  in which the brave girl had repudiated her husband&rsquo;s offer of wealth and independence;  and had declared her proud determination to go out into the world once more, and  to get her own living, and to accept nothing from the man who doubted her truth.</p>
<p>The lawyer had made every effort to lure the lost bird  back to its deserted nest. But if you render your wife&rsquo;s existence intolerable,  and she runs away from you in despair, it is not always possible to bring her back  to your halls; though you may be never so penitent for your offences against her.  Gilbert Monckton had employed every possible means to discover his wife&rsquo;s whereabouts;  but had failed most completely to do so. His search was futile; his advertisements  were unanswered; and, very lonely and miserable, he had dragged out the last six  weeks, in constant oscillation between London and Torquay; always making some new  effort to obtain tidings of the missing girl; perpetually beguiled a little way  onward with false hopes, only to be disappointed. He had gone again and again to  Signora Picirillo; but had received no comfort from her, inasmuch as the music mistress  knew no more about Eleanor than he did.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered, then, that when Richard Thornton  appeared at Torquay, carrying with him Eleanor&rsquo;s letter, he was received with open  arms by the penitent husband. Not an hour was wasted by the eager travellers, but  use what haste they might, they could not hasten the Dover express, or the Calais  packets, or the comfortable jog-trot pace of the train between Calais and Paris;  so they had only been able to arrive at eight o&rsquo;clock in the dusky April evening,  just in time to behold Major Lennard in his moment of triumph.</p>
<p>Gilbert Monckton extended his hand to the stalwart  soldier, after the events of the evening had been hurriedly related by Eleanor and  her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You robbed me of a wife twenty years ago, Major Lennard,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;but you have restored another wife to me to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose we&rsquo;re quits,&rdquo; the major exclaimed cheerfully,  &ldquo;and we can go back to the Palais and have a devilled lobster, hay? I suppose we  must do something for this poor devil though, first, hay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Monckton heartily concurred in this suggestion;  and Richard Thornton, who was better acquainted with Paris than any of his companions,  ran down stairs, told the portress of the malady which had stricken down the lodger  in the entresol, despatched the sharp young damsel with the shrill voice in search  of a sick nurse, and went himself to look for a doctor. In a little more than half-an-hour  both these officials had arrived, and Mr. Monckton and his wife, Major Lennard,  and Richard departed, leaving the Frenchman in the care of his two compatriots.  But before Gilbert Monckton left the apartment, he gave the nurse special orders  respecting the sick man. She was not to let him leave his rooms upon any pretence  whatever; not even if he should appear to become reasonable.</p>
<p>Mr. Monckton went to the H&ocirc;tel du Palais with his young  wife, and, for the first time since he had been wronged, forgave the frivolous woman  who had jilted him. She had been very kind to Eleanor, and he was in a humour to  be pleased with any one who had been good to his wife. So the lawyer shook hands  very heartily with Mrs. Lennard, and promised that she should see her daughter before  long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor little girl has had a hard trial lately,  Mrs. Lennard, through my folly, and I owe her some atonement. I separated her from  her natural protectors, because I was presumptuous enough to imagine that I was  better fitted to plan her destiny; and after all I have wrecked her girlish hopes,  poor child! But I don&rsquo;t think the damage is irreparable: I think she&rsquo;ll scarcely  break her heart about Launcelot Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all this time nobody had cared to ask any questions  about the will. Eleanor had handed it to her husband; and Gilbert Monckton had put  it, still folded, into his pocket. But when the devilled lobster and the sparkling  Moselle, which the major insisted upon ordering,  had been discussed, and the table cleared, Mr. Monckton took the important document  from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well look at poor De Crespigny&rsquo;s last testament,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;and see who has been most injured by the success of Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  fabrication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read the first two sheets of the will to himself,  slowly and thoughtfully. He remembered every word of those two first sheets. So  far the real will was verbatim the same as the forged document: Gilbert Monckton  could therefore now understand why that fabricated will had seemed so genuine. The  fabrication had been copied from the original paper. It was thus that the forgery  had borne the stamp of the testator&rsquo;s mind. The only difference between the two  documents lay in the last and most important clause.</p>
<p>The lawyer read aloud this last sheet of Maurice de  Crespigny&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I devise and bequeath all the residue and remainder  of my real and personal property unto Hortensia Bannister, the daughter of my old  and deceased college friend, George Vane, and my valued friend Peter Sedgewick,  of Cheltenham, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, upon trust,  for the sole and separate use of Eleanor, the daughter of my said dear deceased  friend, George Vane, by his last wife, Eleanor Thompson, during her life, free from  the control, debts, or engagements of any husband she may at any time have, and  so that she shall not have power to anticipate the rents, interest, and annual proceeds  thereof; and upon and after her decease for such persons, estates, and in such manner  as she shall, whether covert or uncovert, by will appoint; and in default of and  subject to any such appointment, by the said Eleanor, the daughter of the said George  Vane, to her heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, according to the nature  of the said property. And in case the said Eleanor shall have departed this life  during my life time, or in case the said last-named trustees cannot discover the  said Eleanor Vane within four years after my decease, then they shall consider the  said Eleanor Vane dead, and therefrom I give and devise the said residuary estates  to be equally divided between my said three nieces, Sarah, Lavinia, and Ellen, absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is fortunate that the money is left to trustees  for your separate use, Eleanor,&rdquo; Mr. Monckton said. &ldquo;If it had been otherwise, the  gift would have been invalid, since I, your husband, was one of the witnesses to  the will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A torrent of congratulations from Major and Mrs. Lennard,  and Richard Thornton, almost overwhelmed Eleanor; but she was still more overwhelmed  by her astonishment at the wording of the will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money left to me!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want  it. I am sorry it should be so. It will seem now as if I had been plotting to get  this fortune. I don&rsquo;t want it: I only want my revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilbert Monckton narrowly watched his wife&rsquo;s astonished  face. He saw no look of triumph, no smile of gratification. At least she was free  from any mercenary baseness. He took her a little way from the rest of the party,  and looked earnestly into her fearless eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own dear love,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have learned a hard  lesson, and I believe that I shall profit by it. I will never doubt you again. But  tell me, Eleanor, tell me once and for ever! have you ever loved Launcelot Darrell?  Have any of your actions been prompted by jealousy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Monckton. &ldquo;I have never loved  him, and I have never been jealous of him. From first to last I have been actuated  by one motive, and one alone&mdash;the duty I owe to my dead father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not abandoned her purpose, then. No; the lurid  star that had beckoned her forward still shone before her. It was so near now, that  its red splendour filled the universe. The young wife was pleased to be reconciled  to her husband; but with the sense that he was restored to her once more, the memory  of the dreary interval in which she had lost him melted away from her mind, and  Launcelot Darrell&mdash;Launcelot Darrell, the destroyer of her dead father, became once  more paramount in her thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gilbert!&rdquo; she said, clasping her hands about her  husband&rsquo;s arm and looking up in his face, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll take me back to England at once,  won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; Mr. Monckton answered, with a sigh.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a jealous pain at his heart as he spoke.  His wife was pure, and true, and beautiful, but this strange purpose of her life  divided her from him; and left his own existence very blank.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter58"></a>Chapter 58<br>
  The Day Of Reckoning</strong></h2>
<p>Launcelot Darrell and his mother had inhabited  Woodlands for a little more than a fortnight. The painters, and paper-hangers, and  upholsterers, had done a great deal to alter the handsome country-house; for Mr.  Darrell had no wish to be reminded of his dead uncle; and familiar chairs and tables  have an unpleasant faculty of suggesting tiresome thoughts, and recalling faded  faces that had better be forgotten. Almost all the old furniture had been swept  away, therefore, and the young man had behaved very generously to his maiden aunts,  who had furnished a small house in Windsor  with the things that Launcelot had banished from Woodlands. These poor disappointed  ladies had located themselves in a quiet little <em>cul-de-sac</em>, squeezed in between  the hilly street and the castle, with the idea that the wild dissipations of a town  life would enable them to forget their wrongs.</p>
<p>So Launcelot Darrell and his mother reigned at Woodlands  instead of the maiden sisters; and Parker, the butler, and Mrs. Jepcott, the housekeeper,  waited upon a new master and mistress.</p>
<p>The young man had chafed bitterly at his poverty, and  had hated himself and all the world, because of those humiliations to which a man  who is too idle to work, and too poor to live without work, is always more or less  subject. But, alas! now that by the commission of a crime he had attained the great  end of his ambition, he found that the game was not worth the candle; and that in  his most fretful moments before Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s death he had never suffered  as much as he now suffered, daily and hourly.</p>
<p>The murderers of the unfortunate Mr. Ware ate a hearty  supper of pork chops while their victim lay, scarcely cold, in a pond beside the  high road; but it is not everybody who is blessed with the strength of mind possessed  by those gentlemen. Launcelot Darrell could not shake off the recollection of what  he had done. From morning till night, from night till morning, the same thoughts,  the same fears, were perpetually pressing upon him. In the eyes of every servant  who looked at him; in the voice of every creature who spoke to him; in the sound  of every bell that rang in the roomy country-house, there lurked a something that  inspired the miserable terror of detection. It haunted him in every place; it met  him at every turn. The knowledge that he was in the power of two bad, unscrupulous  men, the lawyer&rsquo;s clerk, and Victor Bourdon, made him the most helpless of slaves.  Already he had found what it was to be in the power of a vicious and greedy wretch.  The clerk had been easily satisfied by the gift of a round sum of money, and had  levanted before his employer returned from America. But Victor Bourdon became insatiable.  He was a gamester and a drunkard; and he expected to find in Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s  purse a gold mine that was never to be exhausted.</p>
<p>He had abandoned himself to the wildest dissipation  in the worst haunts of London  after Maurice de Crespigny&rsquo;s death; and had appeared at Woodlands at all times and  seasons, demanding enormous sums of his miserable victim. At first terror sealed  Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s lips, and he acceded to the most extravagant demands of his  accomplice; but at last his temper gave way, and he refused that &ldquo;paltry note for  a thousand francs,&rdquo; to which the Frenchman alluded in his interview with Eleanor.  After this refusal there was a desperate quarrel between the two men, at the end  of which the commercial traveller received a thrashing, and was turned out of doors  by the master of Woodlands.</p>
<p>The young man had been quite reckless of consequences  in his passion; but when he grew a little calmer he began to reflect upon the issue  of this quarrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see what harm the man can do me,&rdquo; he thought;  &ldquo;to accuse me is to accuse himself also. And then who would believe his unsupported  testimony? I could laugh at him as a madman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot Darrell had no knowledge of the existence  of the real will. He implicitly believed that it had been burned before his own  eyes, and that Eleanor&rsquo;s assertion to the contrary had been only a woman&rsquo;s falsehood  invented to terrify him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the girl had once had the will in her possession,  she would never have been such a fool as to lose it,&rdquo; he argued.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding all this he felt a vague fear,  all the more terrible because of its indefinite character. He had placed himself  in a false position. The poet is born and not made; and perhaps the same thing may  be said of the criminal. The genius of crime, like the genius of song, may be a  capricious blossom indigenous to such and such a soil, but not to be produced by  cultivation. However this may be, Launcelot Darrell was not a great criminal. He  had none of the reckless daring, the marvellous power of dissimulation, the blind  indifference to the future, which make a Palmer, a Cartouche, a Fauntleroy, or a  Roupell. He was wretched because of what he had done; and he allowed everybody to  perceive his wretchedness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Darrell saw that her son was miserable in spite  of his newly-acquired wealth; and a horrible terror seized upon her. Her sisters  had taken good care to describe to her the scene that had occurred at Woodlands  upon the night of the old man&rsquo;s death. She had watched her son, as only mothers  can watch the children they love; and she had seen that his dead kinsman&rsquo;s fortune  had brought him no happiness. She had questioned him, but had received only sulky,  ungracious answers, and she had not the heart to press him too closely. The mother  and son were alone in the dining-room at Woodlands about a week after the scene  in Monsieur Victor Bourdon&rsquo;s apartment. They had dined <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em>. The dessert  had not been removed, and the young man was still sitting at the bottom of the long  table, lounging lazily in his comfortable chair, and very often refilling his glass  from the claret-jug on his right hand. The three long windows were open, and the  soft May twilight crept into the room. A tall shaded lamp stood in the centre of  the table, making a great spot of yellow light in the dusk. Below the lamp there  was a confused shimmer of cut glass, upon which the light trembled, like moonbeams  upon running water. There were some purple grapes and a litter of vine leaves in  a dessert dish of S&egrave;vres china; the spiky crown of a pine-apple; and scarlet strawberries  that made splashes of vivid colour amid the sombre green. The pictured face of the  dead man hanging upon the wall behind Launcelot Darrell&rsquo;s chair seemed to look reproachfully  out of the shadows. The ruby draperies shading the open windows grew darker with  the fading of the light. The faint odour of lilacs and hawthorn blossoms blew in  from the garden, and the evening stillness was only broken by the sound of leaves,  stirred faintly by a slow night wind that crept amongst the trees.</p>
<p>Mrs. Darrell was sitting in the recess of one of the  open windows, with some needlework in her lap. She had brought her work into the  dining-room after dinner, because she wished to be with her son; and she knew that  Launcelot would sit for the best part of the evening brooding over his half-filled  glass. The young man was most completely miserable. The great wrong he had done  had brought upon him a torture which he was scarcely strong enough to endure. If  he could have undone that wrong&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;! No! That way lay such shame and degradation  as he could never stoop to endure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all my great-uncle&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; he repeated to  himself, doggedly. &ldquo;What business had he to make the will of a madman? Whom have  I robbed, after all? Only a specious adventuress, the intriguing daughter of a selfish  spendthrift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such thoughts as these were for ever rising in the  young man&rsquo;s mind. He was thinking them to-night, while his mother sat in the window,  watching her son&rsquo;s face furtively. He was only roused from his reverie by the sound  of wheels upon the gravel drive, the opening of a carriage-door, and a loud ringing  of the bell.</p>
<p>The arrival of any unexpected visitor always frightened  him; so it was nothing unusual for him to get up from his chair and go to the door  of the room to listen for the sound of voices in the hall.</p>
<p>To-night he turned deadly pale, as he recognised a  familiar voice; the voice of Gilbert Monckton, whom he had not seen since the reading  of the will.</p>
<p>Launcelot Darrell drew back as the servant approached  the door, and in another moment the man opened it, and announced Mr. Monckton, Mrs.  Monckton, Mr. Thornton, Monsieur Bourdon. He would have announced Mr. John Ketch,  I dare say, just as coolly.</p>
<p>Launcelot Darrell planted his back against the low  marble chimneypiece, and prepared to meet his fate. It had come; the realisation  of that horrible nightmare which had tormented him ever since the night of Maurice  de Crespigny&rsquo;s death. It had come; detection, disgrace, humiliation, despair; no  matter by what name it was called, the thing was living death. His heart seemed  to melt into water, and then freeze in his breast. He had seen the face of Victor  Bourdon lurking behind Gilbert and Eleanor, and he knew that he had been betrayed.</p>
<p>The young man knew this, and determined to make a gallant  finish. He was not a coward by nature, though his own wrong-doing had made him cowardly;  he was only an irresolute, vacillating, selfish Sybarite, who had quarrelled with  the great schoolmaster Fate, because his life had not been made one long summer&rsquo;s  holiday. Even cowards sometimes grow courageous at the last. Launcelot Darrell was  not a coward: he drew himself up to his fullest height, and prepared to confront  his accusers.</p>
<p>Eleanor Monckton advanced towards him. Her husband  tried to restrain her, but his effort was wasted; she waved him back with her hand,  and went on to where the young man stood, with her head lifted and her nostrils  quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;after watching  that has wearied me, and failures that have tempted me to despair, at last I can  keep my promise; at last I can be true to the lost father whose death was your cruel  work. When last I was in this house, you laughed at me and defied me. I was robbed  of the evidence that would have condemned you: all the world seemed leagued together  against me. Now, the proof of your crime is in my hands, and the voice of your accomplice  has borne witness against you. Cheat, trickster, and forger: there is no escape  for you now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; exclaimed Monsieur Bourdon, with an unctuous  chuckle, &ldquo;it is now your turn to be chased, my stripling; it is now your turn to  be kicked out of the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From first to last, from first to last,&rdquo; said Eleanor,  &ldquo;you have been false and cruel. You wronged and deceived the friends who sent you  to India&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaase,&rdquo; interrupted the commercial traveller, who  was very pale, and by no means too steady in his nerves, after the attack of delirium  tremens. He had dropped into a chair, and sat trembling and grinning at his late  patron, with a ghastly jocosity that was far from agreeable to behold. &ldquo;Yaase, you  cheat your mo-thair, you cheat your friends. You make belief to go to the Indias,  but you do not go. You what you call shally-shilly, and upon the last moment, when  the machine is on the point of depart, you change the mind. You are well in England,  there is a handsome career for you, as artist, you say. Then you will not go. But  you have fear of your uncle, who has given the money for your&mdash;fit-out&mdash;and for your  passage, and you make believe to do what they wish from you. You have a friend,  a <em>confr&egrave;re</em>, a Mr., who is to partake your cabin. You write to <em>heem</em>,  you get <em>heem</em> to post your letters; you write to your mo-thair, in Clip-a-stone  Street, and you say to her, &lsquo;Dear mo-thair, I cannot bear this broil climate; I  am broil, I work the night and the day; I am indigo planter;&rsquo; and you send your  letter to the Indias to be posted; and your poor mo-thair belief you; and you are  in Paris to enjoy yourself, to lead the life of student, a little Bohemian, but  very gay. You read Balzac, you make the little sketches for the cheap Parisian journals.  You are gamester, and win money from a poor old Englishman, the father of that lady  there; and you make a catspaw of your friend, Victor Bourdon. You are a villain  man, Monsieur Darrell, but it is finished with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Launcelot Darrell,&rdquo; Gilbert Monckton  said, quietly. &ldquo;Every falsehood and trick of which you have been guilty, from first  to last, is known. There is no help for you. The will which my wife holds in her  hand is the genuine will signed by Maurice de Crespigny. This man is prepared to  testify that the will by which you took possession of this estate is a forgery,  fabricated by you and Henry Lawford&rsquo;s clerk, who had in his possession a rough draught  of the real will which he had written at Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s dictation, and who copied  the three different signatures from three letters written by the old man to Henry  Lawford. You are prepared to bear witness to this?&rdquo; added the lawyer, turning to  Victor Bourdon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But certainly,&rdquo; exclaimed the Frenchman, &ldquo;it being  well understood that I am not to suffer by this candour. It is understood that I  am innocent in this affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innocent!&rdquo; cried Launcelot Darrell, bitterly. &ldquo;Why  you were the prime mover in this business. It was your suggestion that first induced&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible, my friend,&rdquo; murmured Monsieur Bourdon,  complacently; &ldquo;but is it, then, a crime to make a little suggestion&mdash;to try to make  oneself useful to a friend! I do not believe it! No matter. I have studied your  English law: I do not think it can touch me, since I am only prepared to swear to  having <em>found</em> this real will, and having before that <em>overheard</em> a conversation  between you and the clerk of the avou&eacute; de Vindsor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You use noble tools, Mrs. Monckton,&rdquo; said Launcelot  Darrell, &ldquo;but I do not know by what right you come into my house, uninvited, and  bringing in your train a very respectable transpontine scene-painter, with whom  I have not the honour to be intimate, and a French commercial traveller, who has  chosen to make himself peculiarly obnoxious to me. It is for the Court of Chancery  to decide whether I am the rightful owner of this house and all appertaining to  it. I shall await the fiat of that court; and in the meantime I have the honour  to wish you good evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid his hand upon the handle of the bell as he  spoke, but he did not pull it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You defy me, then, Launcelot Darrell?&rdquo; said Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad that it is so!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you have not prayed to me for mercy.  I am glad that Providence  has suffered me to avenge my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor Monckton was moving towards the door.</p>
<p>In all this time Ellen Darrell had not once spoken.  She had stood apart in the recess of the window, a dark and melancholy shadow, mourning  over the ruin of her life.</p>
<p>I think that she was scarcely surprised at what had  happened. We sometimes know the people we love, and know them to be base; but we  go on loving them desperately, nevertheless; and love them best when the world is  against them, and they have most need of our love. I speak here of maternal love,  which is so sublime an affection as to be next in order to the love of God.</p>
<p>The widow came suddenly into the centre of the room,  and cast herself on her knees before Eleanor, and wound her arms about the girl&rsquo;s  slender waist, pinning her to the spot upon which she stood, and holding her there.  The mother&rsquo;s arms were stronger than bands of iron, for they were linked about the  enemy of her son. It has been demonstrated by practical zoologists that the king  of beasts, his majesty the lion, is after all a cowardly creature. It is only the  lioness, <em>the mother</em>, whose courage is desperate and indomitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not do this,&rdquo; Ellen Darrell cried; &ldquo;you  shall not bring disgrace upon my son. Take your due, whatever it is; take your paltry  wealth. You have plotted for it, I dare say. Take it, and let us go out of this  place penniless. But no disgrace, no humiliation, no punishment, <em>for him!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Launcelot, &ldquo;get up off your knees.  Let her do her worst. I ask no mercy of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hear him,&rdquo; gasped the widow, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t listen to  him. Oh, Eleanor, save him from shame and disgrace. Save him! save him! I was always  good to you, was I not? I meant to be so, believe me! If ever I was unkind, it was  because I was distracted by regrets and anxieties about him. Oh, Eleanor, forgive  him, and be merciful to me. Forgive him. It is my fault that he is what he is. It  was my foolish indulgence that ruined his childhood. It was my false pride that  taught him to think he had a right to my uncle&rsquo;s money. From first to last, Eleanor,  it is I that am to blame. Remember this, and forgive him, forgive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her throat grew dry, and her voice broke, but her lips  still moved, though no sound came from them, and she was still imploring mercy for  her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive!&rdquo; cried Eleanor, bitterly. &ldquo;Forgive the man  who caused my father&rsquo;s death! Do you think I have waited and watched for nothing?  It seems to me as if all my life had been given up to this one hope. Do you know  how that man has defied me?&rdquo; she exclaimed, pointing to Launcelot Darrell. &ldquo;Do you  know that through him I have been divided from my husband? Bah! why do I speak of  my own wrongs? Do you know that my father, a poor helpless old man, a lonely, friendless  old man, a decayed gentleman, killed himself because of your son? Do you expect  that I am to forget that? Do you think that I can forgive that man? Do you want  me to abandon the settled purpose of my life, the purpose to which I have sacrificed  every girlish happiness, every womanly joy, now that the victory is mine, and that  I can keep my vow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to disengage herself from Ellen Darrell&rsquo;s  arms, but the widow still clung about her, with her head flung back, and her white  face convulsed with anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive him, for my sake,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;give him to  me&mdash;give him to me. He will suffer enough from the ruin of his hopes. He will suffer  enough from the consciousness of having done wrong. He <em>has</em> suffered. Yes.  I have watched him, and I know. Take everything from him. Leave him a penniless  dependant upon the pittance my uncle left to me, but save him from disgrace. Give  him to me. God has given him to me. Woman, what right have you to take him from  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He killed my father,&rdquo; Eleanor answered, in a sombre  voice; &ldquo;my dead father&rsquo;s letter told me to be revenged upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father wrote in a moment of desperation. I knew  him. I knew George Vane. <em>He</em> would have forgiven his worst enemy. He was the  last person to be vindictive or revengeful when his first anger was passed. What  good end will be gained by my son&rsquo;s disgrace? You shall <em>not</em> refuse to hear  me. You are a wife, Eleanor Monckton: you may one day be a mother. If you are pitiless  to me now, God will be pitiless to you then. You will think of me then. In every  throb of pain your child may suffer; in every childish ailment that makes your heart  grow sick with unutterable fear, you will recognise God&rsquo;s vengeance upon you for  this night&rsquo;s work. Think of this, Eleanor; think of this, and be merciful to me&mdash;to <em>me</em>&mdash;not to him. What <em>he</em> would have to endure would be only a tithe  of <em>my</em> suffering. I am his mother&mdash;his mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried Eleanor, lifting her clasped hands  above her head. &ldquo;<em>What</em> am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hour of her triumph had come; and in this supreme  moment doubt and fear took possession of her breast. If this was her victory, it  was only half a victory. She had never thought that any innocent creature would  suffer more cruelly by her vengeance upon Launcelot Darrell than the man himself  would suffer. And now here was this woman, whose only sin had been an idolatrous  love of her son, and to whom his disgrace would be worse than the anguish of death.</p>
<p>The widow&rsquo;s agony had been too powerful for the girl&rsquo;s  endurance. Eleanor burst into a passion of tears, and turning to her husband let  her head fall upon his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do, Gilbert?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What am I to  do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not advise you, my dear,&rdquo; the lawyer answered,  in a low voice. &ldquo;To-night&rsquo;s business is of your own accomplishing. Your own heart  must be your only guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence in the room for a few moments, only  broken by Eleanor&rsquo;s sobbing. Launcelot Darrell had covered his face with his hands.  His courage had given way before the power of his mother&rsquo;s grief. The widow still  knelt, still clung about the girl, with her white face fixed now, in an awful stillness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, dead father!&rdquo; Eleanor sobbed, &ldquo;you&mdash;you  did wrong yourself, sometimes; and you were always kind and merciful to people.  Heaven knows, I have tried to keep my oath; but I cannot&mdash;I cannot. It seemed so  easy to imagine my revenge when it was far away: but now&mdash;it is too hard&mdash;it is too  hard. Take your son, Mrs. Darrell. I am a poor helpless coward. I cannot carry out  the purpose of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white uplifted face scarcely changed, and the widow  fell back in a heap upon the floor. Her son and Gilbert Monckton lifted her up and  carried her to a chair in one of the open windows. Richard Thornton dropped on his  knees before Eleanor, and began to kiss her hands with <em>effusion</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Nelly,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I was  very fond of you once, and very unhappy about you, as my poor aunt can bear witness;  but I am going to marry Eliza Montalambert, and we&rsquo;ve got the carpets down at the  snuggest little box in all Brixton, and I&rsquo;ve made it up with Spavin and Cromshaw  in consideration of my salary being doubled. Don&rsquo;t be frightened if I make a fool  of myself, Eleanor; but I think I could worship you to-night. This is your victory,  my dear. This is the only revenge Providence  ever intended for beautiful young women with hazel brown hair. God bless you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launcelot Darrell, with a grayish pallor spread over  his face, like a napkin upon the face of a corpse, came slowly up to Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been very generous to me, Mrs. Monckton,  though it is a hard thing for me to say as much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have done wicked things,  but I have suffered&mdash;I have suffered and repented perpetually. I had no thought of  the awful consequences which would follow the wrong I did your father. I have hated  myself for that wicked act ever since; I should never have forged the will if that  man had not come to me, and fooled me, and played upon my weaknesses. I will thank  you for the mercy you have shown me by-and-by, Mrs. Monckton, when I am better worthy  of your generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter59"></a>Chapter 59<br>
  The Last</strong></h2>
<p>Gilbert Monckton seconded his wife in all  she wished to do. There was no scandal. All legal formalities were gone through  very quietly. Those troublesome people who require to be informed as to the business  of their neighbours, were told that a codicil had been found, which revoked the  chief clause of Mr. de Crespigny&rsquo;s will. Mr. Peter Sedgewick and Mrs. Bannister  were ready to perform all acts required of them; though the lady expressed considerable  surprise at her half-sister&rsquo;s unexpected accession of wealth. Eleanor Monckton entered  into possession of the estates. The impulsive girl having once forgiven her father&rsquo;s  enemy, would fain have surrendered the fortune to him into the bargain&mdash;but practical  matter-of-fact people were at hand to prevent her being too generous. Mrs. Darrell  and her son went to Italy,  and Mrs. Monckton, with her husband&rsquo;s concurrence, made the young man a very handsome  allowance, which enabled him to pursue his career as an artist. He worked very hard,  and with enthusiasm. The shame of the past gave an impetus to his pencil. His outraged  self-esteem stood him his friend, and he toiled valiantly to redeem himself from  the disgrace that had fallen upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am a great painter, they will remember nothing  against me,&rdquo; he said to himself; and though it was not in him to become a great  painter, he became a popular painter; a great man for the Royal Academy, and the  West End engravers, if only a small man for future generations, who will choose  the real gems out of the prodigal wealth of the present. Mr. Darrell&rsquo;s first success  was a picture which he called &ldquo;The Earl&rsquo;s Death,&rdquo; from a poem of Tennyson&rsquo;s, with  the motto, &ldquo;Oh, the Earl was fair to see,&rdquo;&mdash;a preternaturally ugly man lying at the  feet of a preternaturally hideous woman, in a turret chamber lighted by lucifer  matches&mdash;the blue and green light of the lucifers on the face of the ugly woman,  and a pre-Raphaelite cypress seen through the window; and I am fain to say, that  although the picture was ugly, there was a strange weird attraction in it, and people  went to see it again and again, and liked it, and hankered after it, and talked  of it perpetually all that season; one faction declaring that the lucifer-match  effect was the most delicious moonlight, and the murderess of the Earl the most  lovely of womankind, till the faction who thought the very reverse of this became  afraid to declare their opinions, and thus everybody was satisfied.</p>
<p>So Launcelot Darrell received a fabulous price for  his picture; and, having lived without reproach during three years of probation,  came home to marry Laura Mason Lennard, who had been true to him all this time,  and who would have rather liked to unite her fortunes with those of a modern Cartouche  or Jack Sheppard for the romance of the thing. And although the artist did not become  a good man all in a moment, like the repentant villain of a stage play, he did take  to heart the lesson of his youth. He was tenderly affectionate to the mother who  had suffered so much by reason of his errors, and he made a very tolerable husband  to a most devoted little wife.</p>
<p>Monsieur Victor Bourdon was remunerated&mdash;and very liberally&mdash;for  his <em>services</em>, and was told to hold his tongue. He departed for Canada soon afterwards,  in the interests of the patent mustard, and never reappeared in the neighbourhood  of Tolldale Priory.</p>
<p>Eleanor insisted on giving up Woodlands for the use  of Mr. Darrell, his wife, and mother. Signora Picirillo lived with her nephew and  his merry little wife in the pretty house at Brixton; but she paid very frequent  visits to Tolldale Priory, sometimes accompanied by Richard and Mrs. Richard, sometimes  alone. Matrimony had had a very good effect upon the outward seeming of the scene-painter:  for his young wife initiated him in the luxury of shirt-buttons, as contrasted with  pins; to say nothing of the delights of a shower-bath, and a pair of ivory-backed  hairbrushes, presented by Eleanor as a birthday present to her old friend. Richard  at first suggested that the ivory-backed brushes should be used as chimney-ornaments  in the Brixton drawing-room; but afterwards submitted to the popular view of the  subject, and brushed his hair. Major and Mrs. Lennard were also visitors at Tolldale,  and Laura knew the happiness of paternal and maternal love&mdash;the paternal affection  evincing itself in the presentation of a great deal of frivolous jewellery, purchased  upon credit; the maternal devotion displaying itself in a wild admiration of Launcelot  Darrell&rsquo;s son and heir, a pink-faced baby, who made his appearance in the year 1861,  and who looked very much better than the &ldquo;Dying Gladiator,&rdquo; exhibited by Mr. Darrell  in the same year. Little children&rsquo;s voices sounded by-and-bye in the shady pathways  of the old-fashioned Priory garden, and in all Berkshire  there was not a happier woman than Gilbert Monckton&rsquo;s beautiful young wife.</p>
<p>And, after all, Eleanor&rsquo;s Victory was a proper womanly  conquest, and not a stern, classical vengeance. The tender woman&rsquo;s heart triumphed  over the girl&rsquo;s rash vow; and poor George Vane&rsquo;s enemy was left to the only Judge  whose judgments are always righteous.</p>
