<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1</strong> </h2>
<p>Lady Mary Harling was going back to  England, after a winter in Ceylon. She was too idle, too utterly without  ambitions or views, to be free from chronic illness. She suffered from a  tendency to asthma, in a very mild form, always talked of by herself and her  friends as her asthma; as if it were a rare and peculiar malady, while there  were dressmakers&rsquo; assistants and factory girls in London reckoned by thousands,  who were afflicted in the same manner, and who took the thing as a matter of  course, just an occasional shortness of breath that made hard work and long  hours a shade more irksome. In Whitechapel and Bermondsey it was everybody&rsquo;s  asthma, occasioning frequent visits to the Dispensary; in Hertford Street,  Mayfair, it was Lady Mary Harling&rsquo;s asthma, and a theme for fashionable  physicians to expatiate upon with unctuous solicitude, meditating, or seeming  to meditate, profoundly, before they advised the precise spot upon this globe  that would be best for their cherished patient in the coming winter. Last year  it had been Assouan, and the year before it had been Cairo, and the year before  that St. Moritz, and before that Meran. This last winter had been spent in  Ceylon; and Lady Mary was going home bored to death with all that she had seen  and done, the gardens, temples, palaces, bazaars, people&mdash;most of all the white  people she knew in England. She was going home, not happy, but resigned,  knowing that there was more boredom waiting for her&mdash;the impalpable invisible,  black devil of ennui in town and country, in her too spacious house in Hertford  Street, in her fine old Georgian mansion in Hampshire, on the edge of the New  Forest. </p>
<p>Needless to say that Lady Mary had one of  the best cabins, midship, on the upper deck of the <em>Electra</em>, one of the finest  steamers recently built by the most renowned company trafficking in passengers  only between the Thames and the Hoogly. It was a cabin for three, adapted for  one, and in a smaller cabin on the same expensive deck she had her maid and her  <em>souffre-douleur</em>, a dowerless kinswoman of six-and-twenty,  whom she had taken to herself eight years before, when the girl was young and  pretty, and when her friends hoped that in such distinguished surroundings she  might make a comfortable, or even a brilliant marriage. The poor child&rsquo;s  chances in the matrimonial line were blighted by a terrible sorrow that came  upon Lady Mary in the second year of Daisy Meredith&rsquo;s service, a calamity that  put a sudden end to all foregatherings of the young and lively in Hertford  Street, or at Cranford Park. As years wore on Lady Mary had seen more society;  but she seemed to have taken an aversion to young people, and never had any of  them about her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t amuse them, and they don&rsquo;t amuse  me,&rdquo; she said, when her intimates accused her of cultivating dullness. </p>
<p>She let the Cranford  shooting, and gave the money to a Bournemouth hospital. Her friends were all of  them past forty, some grave and learned, some frivolous and pleasure-loving,  but none young. From young men in particular she shrank with a kind of disgust.  She could better put up with girls. This was a consequence of the great grief  that had come upon her suddenly when Daisy Meredith was nineteen. </p>
<p>Daisy at twenty-six had made up her mind  to a life of spinsterhood, and did not even know that she was still pretty. She  was attached to her friend and protectress, who had taken her from a shabby home  in an interminable road in the dismal north of London, and from her place as  buffer between a father and mother who quarrelled incessantly when they were  together, and who occasionally separated, but always made the mistake of coming  together again. The life in Hertford Street was elysium after the life in the  Seven Sisters Road; and Daisy was able to be of more use to her mother by  little gifts out of her handsome allowance than ever she had been as buffer.  The allowance was called pocket-money, and everybody knew her as a useful  cousin, and not a salaried companion. </p>
<p>Somewhere in the hull of the ship there  was a footman, whose most arduous duties during the voyage were limited to the  careful placing of her ladyship&rsquo;s deck-chair, rugs, and sun-umbrellas, on the  promenade deck, generally wrong as to wind and sun till corrected by one of the  ship&rsquo;s officers, and in fetching and carrying books and magazines and work bags  at Miss Meredith&rsquo;s bidding. Like most women of large means and no ambitions,  Lady Mary was an accomplished needle-woman, deeply interested in every revival  of old art in pictorial embroidery. Her latest task was a panel for a screen, a  landscape of Dutch formality, with a row of poplars in a laborious raised  stitch, every tree requiring months of patient toil. The panel, closely veiled  in tissue paper, was stretched on a frame, and to establish this conveniently  for Lady Mary&rsquo;s labour was a work of time. It gave the cousin and maid and  footman something to do every morning, either on the open deck or in the  ladies&rsquo; drawing-room, and to re-establish it in her ladyship&rsquo;s cabin after  luncheon. </p>
<p>Lady Mary had acknowledged to  eight-and-forty for the last three years, but was believed, from the evidence  of history, to be older. She had been seventeen years a widow, and was still  handsome enough to bring no shame upon handsome clothes. Dress was a subject to  which she gave serious thought, and she considered herself successful. She  loved bright colour; in her houses, and in her gowns. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I had rather be garish than dull,&rdquo; she  told people. </p>
<p>That great sorrow,  the unutterable grief of six years ago, had spread so dark a pall over the life  of the heart, that she had been forced to take pleasure in externals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I  have only things to interest me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am always bored, but I make a  good fight against boredom.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She was a member of the Dante Society, and  took a keen delight in their proceedings, and read a little Dante every day as  piously as her Bible. She took Daisy Meredith to all the best concerts of the  season, to hear all the old favourites, and all the new prodigies on piano or  fiddle. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good for you, if it sometimes bores  me,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>So it will be seen that Daisy Meredith did  not eat the bread of tears, albeit no lover had come a-wooing. </p>
<p>The double cabin that Daisy shared with  Margot, the devoted Provencal maid, was near the stern. Lady Mary&rsquo;s neighbours  on one side were a Colonel and his wife, and on the other side there was a  two-berth cabin occupied by a young lady from Calcutta with her maid, a young  lady who was too ill or too unhappy to appear in public, and whom Lady Mary had  not seen. She had encountered the maid several times in the corridor, a  middle-aged woman, sour-visaged and severe. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your young lady is very ill,&rdquo;  she said to the maid one morning. &ldquo;I heard her sobbing and moaning last night.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The woman pinched her lips, and answered  curtly: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hysterical.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She brushed past Lady Mary, and  disappeared in the cabin. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What a churlish person to have charge of  a sick girl,&rdquo; thought Lady Mary, full of pity for the distressed  fellow-creature whose low moaning, broken now and then by a suppressed sob, had  kept her awake between two and three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. </p>
<p>They were in the stifling heat of the Red  Sea, and every port-hole was open, and sounds were audible from cabin to cabin. </p>
<p>The moaning sound was in the hot heavy air  when Lady Mary fell asleep, and she heard it again when she awoke at six  o&rsquo;clock. After that there was only silence in the girl&rsquo;s cabin&mdash;and no sound of  speech all the morning, though Lady Mary could hear the door opening and  shutting, the maid going in and out, the clinking of cup and spoon when the  girl was taking her breakfast. No speech. </p>
<p>She thought much of this solitary girl,  after her encounter with the cross-grained attendant. Girls are not hysterical  for nothing. The moaning and sobbing in the silent night hours could only mean  mental distress. What was the sorrow that watched with her in those dreary  night hours? Was it grief at being parted from a lover; or mourning for some  near and dear one lately lost: father, mother, sister, brother? </p>
<p>And to be solitary in  her sorrow, with no one near her but her hard-featured, unmannerly maid! Lady  Mary&rsquo;s heart went out to this unknown girl in her loneliness, a heart full of  pity and yearning. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do something,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t lie here, night after night, like a log, while that girl hugs her sorrow.  Surely sympathy, soothing words from a motherly woman, might bring her some  little comfort.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She had said no word  about the lonely girl to Daisy, who was all kindness for her fellow-creatures,  nor to her maid, Margot, whose exuberant Southern nature would have been quick  to pity, eager to console, if it were only by offering to retrim a hat, or  devise something new in hairdressing. Lady Mary felt that those secrets of the  night season, the sorrow with which proximity had made her acquainted, were not  to be told to the first comer. Something she felt she must do; and one sultry  breathless day, when the maid had gone to her dinner, Lady Mary knocked gently  at the door of the next cabin. </p>
<p>A fretful voice answered quickly, &ldquo;Come  in,&rdquo; and then, as the fine, matronly figure, the handsome face and silver hair,  appeared in the doorway, &ldquo;I thought it was the stewardess,&rdquo; continued the  voice, rather more fretfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come into the wrong cabin.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The girl was sitting on her  sofa-berth&mdash;wrapped in a loose white dressing-gown, her hair coiled in a great  careless knot on the top of her head, her bare feet in red slippers without  heels. Lady Mary&rsquo;s keen vision realised every detail. She looked slovenly,  forlorn, uncared for, out of health, but she was exquisitely beautiful. Her  face shone in the cramped cabin space, like a light; her form was no less  exquisite. The muslin dressing-gown hanging loosely over the lawn night-gown  revealed every line of the perfect figure; but, while the matron&rsquo;s eyes gazed  at her in startled admiration, the girl snatched up a large soft shawl that had  fallen on the floor, and wrapped it hastily round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no  mistake,&rdquo; Lady Mary said gently. &ldquo;I am in the next cabin; and, knowing that you  were quite alone&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not alone. I have my maid.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she is not a companion for you.  Very useful, no doubt, but no companion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want company. I prefer being  alone&mdash; thank you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was a pause before the last two  words, and the tone was not over-gracious. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, I have heard you  sobbing in the night. I can&rsquo;t help having ears, you know; and I should like so  much to be of use to you. I thought perhaps I might help you to think of  pleasant things; to put aside your grief, now and then; to take courage, and to  face life bravely. No life is all sorrow.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to say that. I daresay you  have been lucky, and have never known what trouble means. You look like that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A woman of fifty, as perfectly dressed and  <em>coiff&eacute;e</em> as Lady Mary always was, is apt to give that impression;  and her appearance certainly made a marked contrast to the girl&rsquo;s slovenly  forlornness. </p>
<p>She had drawn her feet up onto the sofa,  and sat huddled in the big red shawl, making herself as ungraceful a bundle as  she could. But the lovely head and throat, the perfect shoulders, the shining  copper bronze of her hair, the large hazel eyes, and red sorrowful mouth could not  be hidden. Mary Harling looked at her with a sad reproachfulness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known a great sorrow, a sorrow  that went very near to break my heart,&rdquo; she said gravely. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; the girl said  quickly, and then, looking at her visitor with great angry eyes, like a wild  beast at bay, she said: &ldquo;And in the days of your great sorrow perhaps you  didn&rsquo;t much want to see people&mdash;especially strangers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Lady Mary. &ldquo;You must  kindly pardon my intrusion, which I sincerely regret.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She had left the cabin, and shut the door,  before the girl could reply. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an officious old fool,&rdquo; she told  herself angrily, as she shut her own cabin door, a little more sharply than  usual. </p>
<p>Three minutes afterwards there came an  impetuous knock on the panel. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Lady Mary. </p>
<p>The door opened quickly, and the girl  appeared, the red shawl skewered round her with a gold safety-pin, and her long  white dressing-gown trailing on the floor. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I was rude,&rdquo; she faltered.  &ldquo;You meant to be kind to me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was a sullen air even in her  apology; but Lady Mary saw the lovely red lips quivering, the eyes strained as  if to keep back tears. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said kindly, and drew the  girl onto her sofa, and put a down pillow behind her shoulders. &ldquo;I did mean to  be kind. I wanted to cheer you, if I could. It must be sad to be alone on a  voyage, or with only a maid. And yours doesn&rsquo;t seem a pleasant person.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a horror; but I suppose she means  well. She is extremely respectable.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She said the last words with a curious  sneering emphasis that did not escape Lady Mary. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a daughter who is the very pink  of respectability,&rdquo; the girl went on, becoming suddenly voluble. &ldquo;She is always  talking of herself and her daughter. It is her only idea of conversation. Her  daughter passed all the standards at a Board School, and went into service at  seventeen. She was perfection as a children&rsquo;s maid in a great house; and at  nineteen she married the head gardener, and her mistress gave her a wedding  present, and she never did anything wrong in her life, never, never, never!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That kind of conversation must be rather  boring.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Boring! I turn my face to the wall, and clench  my hands, and wish myself dead. I always wish that; but I wish a little more  intensely when Wareham is telling me about her daughter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, you must not say that. We have  to make the best of our lot upon earth, come what may. You must let me be your  friend, while we are on the ship, no matter how our ways are to be parted  afterwards. Have you any nice books with you? Look at my travelling library &mdash;  my favourite poets&mdash;and Charles Lamb, and a Dickens, and a Thackeray or two. At  my age old books are old friends. Is  there anything there you would like to read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes had been roving round the  cabin, where there was a gracious elegance in all the trivial conveniences and  adornments that gave the key note to the occupant&rsquo;s life. Down cushions in  embroidered muslin covers, with soft silk frills, Indian coverlet and <em>porti&egrave;re</em> of exquisite  needlework, writing-cases, work-basket, delicately bound books, everything  choice and graceful and pretty, the belongings of a woman into whose life  nothing sordid or ugly, cheap or pretentious, had ever entered. And Lady Mary  herself in her soft silk, middle-aged gown, with an old Mechlin lace fichu,  fastened neatly with one large turquoise, was in perfect harmony with her  surroundings. Everything had the same air of calm superiority; and everything  jarred upon the girl&rsquo;s over-strung nerves. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have &lsquo;Jane Eyre,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said,  after a pause. &ldquo;I should like to read that again.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary took the volume out of the row  of books in the shelf over her berth. It was bound in dark green morocco, with  a good deal of gold work, and inlaid with scarlet calf. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I made her as fine as I could, because I  am so fond of her,&rdquo; she said, as she put the book in the girl&rsquo;s hand. </p>
<p>The girl turned the leaves, looking at the  pages dreamily, and gave a long heart-broken sigh. </p>
<p>&ldquo;How happy I was when I read this book,&rdquo;  she said presently, &ldquo;and yet I thought I was miserable. It was at school, and  novels were contraband. That made us fonder of them. One of the housemaids used  to get them for us&mdash;from the grocer, bright red cloth books, printed on cheap  paper. &lsquo;Jane Eyre&rsquo; was the gem.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a happy school?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pretty well, as schools go, I  believe. It was an expensive school. There were only twenty girls, and we had a  fine garden&mdash;tennis court&mdash;croquet ground, and we dined late, and had to wear low  frocks for dinner. There was a great deal of fuss; but I think most of the  girls liked it. I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary was on the point of asking the  whereabouts of the school, but checked herself. She wanted to obtain this  girl&rsquo;s confidence, because it seemed to her that the girl had sore need of a  friend; and the best way to win her from her sullen reserve was to refrain from  asking a single question. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of your lovely book,&rdquo; the  girl said, rising to go, and then, as she neared the door, &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t  know even my name,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is Brown&mdash;Jane Brown.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary did not try to detain her. She  wanted the girl to get accustomed to the idea of a friendly neighbour. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray come in and see me sometimes when  you are bored,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I generally stay in my cabin between lunch and tea.  Or would you not like to come on deck with me some fine morning? I&rsquo;m sure the  air would be good for you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, no. I hate  the deck. And I feel too ill to dress properly. But if I may come here, once in  a way, when I want to hear a human voice that is not Wareham&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, come. I shall be very glad to see  you. I am generally alone at this time. My young cousin enjoys herself so much  all the morning that she wants a long siesta.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear her laughing,&rdquo; said Miss Brown.  &ldquo;She must be a very cheerful person.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a very happy disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Miss Brown knocked at the cabin door at  the same hour next day. She was dressed quite neatly in a blue muslin  morning-gown, and her hair was tidier&mdash;those masses of copper-brown hair, which  Lady Mary admired. She brought back &ldquo;Jane Eyre,&rdquo; wrapped in tissue paper. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You must read very quickly,&rdquo; said Lady  Mary; &ldquo;but perhaps you have only skimmed the book at a second reading.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I read every word. It took me out of  myself. I was Jane Eyre&mdash;and not Jane Brown. Her troubles were my troubles. I  don&rsquo;t think she had so bad a time after all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What, not when she ran away from the man  who worshipped her&mdash;not when she was starving on the moor?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have been  proud of herself all the time, because she was worshipped by that stern strong  man, and because she had fought the battle and won, and had never lost her  self-respect. I don&rsquo;t think starving on the moor mattered. She knew he loved  her. She knew she had done a great thing in leaving him. I believe she was  always happy&mdash;always&mdash;after she knew that Rochester loved her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She dashed some tears from her eyes with  an angry movement of her hand, a lovely hand, perfectly moulded, only a shade  too white for the beauty of youth and health. </p>
<p>Mary Harling was glad to hear her talk.  There had been no sobs or moaning heard in the night, and no doubt the girl had  read all night, or had read herself to sleep. Anything was better than an  incessant brooding on her own sorrows, whatever those might be. </p>
<p>She sat on the cabin sofa nearly an hour  watching Lady Mary at work upon one of her poplars, the taper fingers drawing  the silken thread in and out, the hand now above, now below the frame. It  seemed a work of ages. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your trees don&rsquo;t grow as fast as the  poplars out of doors,&rdquo; the girl said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is slow work. Penelope might have  tired out her suitors without the nightly task of unpicking.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There were lapses of silence, with only  the faint rustle of Lady Mary&rsquo;s silken sleeve as her hand moved to and fro. </p>
<p>Presently, after a little speech about  indifferent things, Lady Mary ventured a question. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are going home to relations  you love?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to a woman I never saw, though  she is my father&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are going to live with her till  your people come home?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. I have only my father,  and he will not leave India for the next three years.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your aunt is a nice, kind person,  and that her surroundings will be all that you like.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care much for surroundings. She  must live in a house with walls and a roof, and there will be air to breathe,  and food to eat, and a bed to lie upon.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear you talk in that  despondent strain,&rdquo; Lady Mary said, very gently. &ldquo;You are so young, and,  forgive me for saying, so lovely, that it is cruel to think you can be without  hope.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true all the same, I have nothing  to hope for,&rdquo; and then, after a pause: &ldquo;and everything to dread.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She clasped her hands before her face,  struggling with her sobs, then rose quickly, and went to the door. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going back to my cabin,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;it always hurts me to talk of myself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary put her arms round her, and  kissed her reluctant cheek. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will never speak of your own  affairs again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You shall have all my sympathy, without a single  question. Forgive me if I stirred the waters of Marah.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;They need no stirring. They drown my  heart day and night.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to me again to-morrow; and we will  talk of only pleasant things. And you must choose another book before you go.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; The girl surveyed the shelf  slowly, then put up her hand and drew out a slim volume half bound in gilded  vellum. </p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Scarlet Letter!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed Lady  Mary. &ldquo;Oh, that is such a painful story!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me read it. My father took it  away from me a year ago, when I was not half through it, for fear I should  learn things a girl ought not to know. Is that your idea of girls? That they  ought to know nothing of the sorrow and shame that some women have to suffer.  Some who are no older than themselves?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a difficult problem. I have no  daughter, so I have not had to answer the question. Take Hawthorne&rsquo;s book, if  you like. It is exquisitely written; but I&rsquo;m afraid it will make you sad.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary woke in the dead of the night,  at the sound of stifled sobs in the next cabin. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;Scarlet Letter&rdquo; was not an effectual  anodyne.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter2"></a><strong>Chapter 2</strong></h2>
<p>The <em>Electra</em> was nearing Brindisi, and a great many passengers  were prepared to leave her; cabin trunks, handbags, books, umbrella cases, and  frivolities of all kinds were packed and ready for unshipping, maids and valets  were busy, and on the alert for the work of landing.</p>
<p>Lady Mary was going home in a leisurely  way, meaning to break the journey and loiter at any place she cared for, at  Venice, at Verona, on the Italian Lakes, with perhaps a week in Paris, to order  gowns and hats, and look about her in a general way. She had friends among the <em>haute noblesse</em>, in solemn houses, in  grey dull streets in the old St. Germain faubourg, set back from the traffic of  the stony street, beyond the echoes of stony courtyards made more melancholy by  funereal evergreens in great green tubs, houses with double flights of marble  stairs, and a glass canopy over the door. Lady Mary was a welcome visitor in  many such houses, and had the history of their owners engraved upon her  capacious brain, with all the relationships, to the furthest cousin, set down  as in a funeral letter. She had known the Orleans Princes and their belongings,  at Twickenham and Ham, and Bushey Park, and Stowe; and she loved to talk of  them. A week in Paris was a treat that she always gave herself after a winter  in distant places. </p>
<p>Jane Brown was to stay with the ship to  the bitter end. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you were coming with my cousin and  me,&rdquo; said Lady Mary, who had grown fond of the girl, or as fond as Jane Brown  would allow her to be. </p>
<p>Jane had come to her cabin every  afternoon, staying a shorter or longer time as the spirit moved her.  Conversation often flagged, for the girl&rsquo;s reticence made it difficult, and  Jane would sit in silence with a joyless face, watching Lady Mary&rsquo;s needle,  almost as if it were a penitential task so to watch, a kind of intellectual  crank, exercising her mind upon useless labour. </p>
<p>She was always the same, and in those many  days of friendly intercourse Mary Harling felt that she had got no nearer to  the suffering soul behind that melancholy outward form. She knew that the soul  was steeped in sadness; but she knew nothing of the cause. Her guesses were  painful; for such persistent gloom in so young a creature must needs have a  bitter root. </p>
<p>The girl had obstinately refused to be  introduced to Daisy Meredith. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a good deal older than you, but  she would be more in sympathy with you than I can be,&rdquo; Lady Mary urged. &ldquo;She is  still a girl, very young for her age, and so bright and cheerful. She would do  you good.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ask me, I like to sit here  with you for a little while every day. Your kindness has let a ray of light  into my life. You&mdash;you are such a lady; you are so strong. But I could not talk  to a girl. My life will never be like a girl&rsquo;s life again. We should not have a  thought in common.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mary Harling brooded over that strange  sentence. &ldquo;My life will never be like a girl&rsquo;s life again.&rdquo; </p>
<p>From a girl who did not look nineteen such  a speech argued utter ruin. Never again. It argued the irrevocable, the  mischance that had changed the cup of girlhood from sweet to bitter. A broken  vow, a trust betrayed, a young life spoilt. </p>
<p>It was between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock, on  the night before they came to Brindisi. Lady Mary had dismissed cousin and  maid, and was sitting in her dressing-gown, reading one of those devotional  books, with which, or with a chapter or two of Holy Writ, she was wont to  soothe her spirits before she tried to sleep. To-night she had chosen a sermon  of Frederick Robertson&rsquo;s, whose discourses never wearied her, though she knew  them almost as well as the Psalms. He was her preacher of preachers, the  wisest, the most delicate in apprehension, the most generous in love and pity  for his brother man. </p>
<p>There came a light knocking at the cabin  door. She knew the hand, for it always seemed as if she could hear it flutter  as it knocked, shrinkingly, timidly. </p>
<p>She went quickly to open the door. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Come in, come in, my dear girl. I had bolted  myself in for the night; but I am very glad to see you. Our last night  together! Sit down and let us have our last talk. The Captain says we can land  directly after breakfast. I shall be at Danielli&rsquo;s to-morrow night. I wish you  were coming with us.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;How happy you look,&rdquo; said the girl,  contemplating her with a kind of fearful wonder, &ldquo;how serene, and how strong! I  mean how strong in courage and resolution.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I have had to bear sorrow that  might break any woman&rsquo;s heart. I used to think my heart was broken.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it something very dreadful? The death  of someone you loved?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No,  thank God, it was not death. But it was only less dreadful than death. But I  don&rsquo;t want to talk of that. You have never told me your trouble, and I won&rsquo;t  tell you mine. Only I want you to know that though I seem a frivolous over-prosperous  woman I have gone through the valley of the shadow, and the shadow has been  round and about me for six years of my life.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you can hope. You may come back  into the sunshine some day.&rdquo; </p>
<p>After this there was a silence. The girl  sat huddled in a corner of the sofa, her clasped hands resting on her knees.  Lady Mary noted the straining of the small hands, the thin pale fingers  interwoven. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You can keep  yourself alive with hope,&rdquo; she said, after a long pause; and then she burst  into tears, suddenly, her forehead bowed upon the clenched hands, her form  shaken by convulsive sobbing. </p>
<p>There came a sharp,  knock at the cabin door, and the maid&rsquo;s harsh voice. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come to bed, miss. It is  past eleven, and you oughtn&rsquo;t to be out of your own cabin.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary opened the door and faced the  intruder. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your young lady is going to stay with me  a little longer. I will see that she goes back to her cabin in good time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The tone of authority subdued the  sour-faced person. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very late for Miss Brown to be out  of her cabin,&rdquo; she said sullenly, and sullenly withdrew. </p>
<p>Mary Harling seated herself by the sobbing  girl, and tried to raise her drooping head. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me comfort you, if I can,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me your trouble? I might advise; I might help you even. I could  at least do more than that disagreeable maid of yours. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to  confide in me&mdash;even if it is something very sad&mdash;something that makes you  ashamed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The  last few words were whispered, as Lady Mary drew the girl&rsquo;s head to her bosom,  and gently smoothed the disordered hair, with a motherly hand, the hand that  had caressed her boy&rsquo;s handsome head when he came to her flushed with a day&rsquo;s  sport, on the cricket ground, or in the hunting field; a hand that had not  forgotten the maternal touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you!  I must tell you: now that you are leaving the ship, now that we shall never  meet again. Will you promise never to repeat what I tell you&mdash;never to speak of  me to any living creature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I promise.  Nothing you tell me to-night shall ever be repeated by me, without your  distinct permission.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will trust you. I came here  because I felt that I must tell you. My heart was bursting. But you will  despise me&mdash;you will loathe me, when you know.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She struck her hand fiercely on the loose  muslin that was folded over her breast. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scarlet Letter,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the  Scarlet Letter ought to be there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The story was told in that speech. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor, poor, unhappy girl!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary took her in her motherly arms  and wept over her, with more emotion than she had felt for anyone not of her  own kin. She had suspected some evil thing from the beginning, for the girl&rsquo;s  trouble expressed itself in a way that could mean no common trouble. The  solitary voyage, the stern-faced attendant, every detail, hinted at a ruined  life, a young life destroyed in its bloom, a bud blighted and cankered before  it could become a rose. And the desolate creature was so lovely, gifted with  beauty that in happy surroundings, in the sunlight of good luck, might have  made her one of society&rsquo;s queens. Whatever her fault had been, however deep her  fall, Mary Harling&rsquo;s heart bled for her, as she felt the young bosom heaving  with convulsive sobs, and the strained grip of the slender hands that clung to  her arm. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall never meet again,&rdquo; the girl  said, &ldquo;and I want you to know what an unhappy wretch I am.&rdquo; She went on  breathlessly, in short sentences, punctuated by sobs. &ldquo;I only left school in  England a year and a half ago. I went to my father and mother in India. I had  not seen my father since I was a child. I hardly remembered him, except that he  didn&rsquo;t care much for me, and that he was often angry about trifles. But my  mother and I had been parted only two years, and I adored her. I was her only  child. There had been another, a son, but he died before he was a year old. We  adored each other. There never was such a mother. I flew into her arms when she  came to meet me, and I saw death in her face. That was my first sorrow. She  only lived four months after I landed, lived and suffered. When she died I was  alone in the world, for I knew my father did not care for me. He had another  person to think about; someone he had no right to care for. Before the hot  weather began he sent me to Cashmere, with one of his nieces, a Colonel&rsquo;s wife,  who was gay and bright and kind and easy-going, as everybody was in Cashmere.  My father went with his friends to Simla.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was a pause, the girl struggled with  her sobs, and Lady Mary waited patiently. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If you promise never, never, never to  repeat what I tell you, I can trust you, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never broken a promise.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;After my mother died I used to lie awake  half the night longing for her, and thinking that there was no one in the world  who loved me. And for the rest of the night I used to dream that she was still  alive, and that we were happy. When I woke from that dream &mdash; it was almost the  same every night&mdash;I used to wish that I was dead. But afterwards in Cashmere I  knew that there was another kind of love, a love that dazzled me, a love that  wrapped me round like fire. I was happy, happy, happier than words can tell.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She clung to Lady Mary, she buried her  face upon the matron&rsquo;s ample shoulder, and for the first time that good  Christian felt a touch of repulsion. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I loved him; but his  influence changed my life, almost from the day we first met. He was handsome,  fearless of man or beast, strong-willed, impetuous. He gave me no peace till he  had made me love him. He took possession of my soul, and made himself my  master, and it seemed sweet to obey him, to know that he was always thinking  about me, and watching, and following me. We were always together. My cousin  encouraged him. People said he was rich. He was a great match, she told me, and  I was a very lucky girl to have caught him. Vulgar, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hideously vulgar,&rdquo; said Lady Mary. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we were often together, and alone.  My cousin had her own pleasures, and was always busy, so she let me do what I  liked. We went for long forest rides. We climbed lonely hills. One evening at  sunset, when we had lost our way, he repeated some verses of Byron&rsquo;s&mdash;a scene on  a Greek Island&mdash;Haidee and Juan, and after that he used to call me Haidee,  whenever we were alone. Then one day my cousin made a fuss, and told him people  were beginning to say ill-natured things about us; and he must either declare  himself, or must go away and never see me again. He said he must go, if she  thought fit, for he was not free to marry. He had thought of me only as a  romantic child, and had never imagined that any scandal could come of his  liking for me. A year ago when he was in America he had engaged himself to a  Boston girl, an heiress. Her money was of no consequence to him, for he was an  only son, and would be well-off by-and-by; but he was bound to the young lady  at Boston. My cousin told me this, and I listened to her without a word; and  she never knew that I was a lost creature, scorched, seared, consumed by the  fire of that dreadful love. Think what it was, to have loved as Haidee loved,  never to have doubted that I was to be his wife, that I was to belong to him  for ever, and then to hear that we must part.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an insufferable villain,&rdquo; said  Lady Mary, with clenched teeth. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose other men are as cruel,  when girls are fools. Oh, the shame of it, the shame,&rdquo; with a sudden rush of scalding  tears, &ldquo;the agony of knowing that I was an outcast for the rest of my life.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never see him again?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Once. He made his way to me at night. He  cried over me. He threw himself upon the ground, and cursed himself, and beat  his head upon the floor. He told me that he would have made any sacrifice to  have me for his wife, if he had not been bound in honour to another girl, a  girl who would die if he jilted her. I think he was sorry&mdash; but he said I was so  young, and I would forget him, and make a good match, and perhaps be a great  lady.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not know&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What you know,&rdquo; whispered the girl, with  her face hidden. &ldquo;No, he never knew that. He left Cashmere after that night.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have never written to him?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But others had to  know.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Wareham told my father. He never spoke  like a father to me after that. He arranged for me to go to his sister in  Ireland. I am to stay with her till he comes to fetch me. It may be two years,  three years, five, six, seven years.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child, poor child.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary found herself wanting in words  of consolation. To a woman of mature years, with whom chastity was a habit of  the mind, such a fall as this, the fall of a well-born, well-bred girl, was  inconceivable. She could better understand the outcast of the streets, the  village beauty, betrayed and abandoned, flung into a gulf as black as hell. She  was not without pity; but she was without understanding. She wanted to speak  words of healing and comfort, but the words would not come. She could only  think of the disgracefulness, the shamefulness of the story. A girl, educated  at a respectable English school, a girl whose heart was still bleeding from the  loss of a good mother, a girl in the freshness of youth, to whom the faintest  touch of impurity should be horrible, for such an one to fling herself into the  arms of her first lover, consumed by the fire of lawless love! It was unthinkable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; she asked, almost  sternly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be eighteen in April.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your cousin was as wicked as your  seducer: to take no more care of a girl of seventeen.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The girl started to her feet, releasing  herself from Lady Mary&rsquo;s surrounding arms. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You are disgusted with me,&rdquo; she said  shortly. &ldquo;I was a fool to tell you. And some day, if chance should bring us  together again, you will point me out to your friends as a disreputable  creature, unfit to mix with decent people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given you my promise.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary was of that modern Anglican  Church which loves the things that belong to the old Faith. An ivory crucifix  hung over her berth. The girl had often looked at it, with dreary eyes, finding  no comfort in the thought of a Redeemer. She looked at it now with a sudden  purpose, snatched it from the hook where it hung, and put it into Lady Mary&rsquo;s  hands. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;upon this cross, that  you will never give me away.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The slang phrase was repellant at such a  moment, and Lady Mary answered stiffly: </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have promised,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that is  enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, it is not enough. I hate  myself for having babbled to you. I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it if I were not  distracted. I must have your oath. I know you are a religious woman, and if you  swear upon that crucifix, you will not break your word.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mary Harling lifted the sacred symbol to  her lips. &ldquo;I swear never to repeat what you have told me,&rdquo; she said, in a low  grave voice, and then, putting her arm round the girl, and making her sit down  beside her, she said gently: </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been very hardly used &mdash; yet you  have, I fear, yourself to blame in some part, for the trouble that has come  upon your young life &mdash;but your Saviour will accept your atonement of shame and  sorrow. He has pardoned you, as He pardoned the nameless woman who had sinned,  and saved her from the Pharisees&rsquo; fierce law. You are very young&mdash;and after some  quiet years in Ireland, years in which you must cultivate your mind, and try to  do all the good that you possibly can to the people about you&mdash;the poor people  and children that you may find there, and whom you can help and teach&mdash;after  those years, which you can make years of atonement, you may begin a new life,  you may feel yourself a new woman, cleansed and purified by sorrow and good  works.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And then Lady Mary repeated a sentence in  the sermon she had been reading when Jane Brown came to her door, which had  come back to her mind while she sat dumb and unsympathetic. </p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Forget mistakes; organise victory out  of mistakes!&rsquo; That is what the noblest preacher I know of told sinners. But in  that happier time which you must hope for, if a good man should give you his  love, and ask you to be his wife, don&rsquo;t cheat him. Tell him all your sorrowful  past. Don&rsquo;t shirk the shame of it. If he really loves you he will forgive and  take you to his heart. Don&rsquo;t palter with the truth. Bear your burden; and be  sure that truth is best.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never marry.  I would rather go down to my grave alone than bear the shame of such a  confession. I have told you. I could not tell a man: least of all a man I  loved. I shall never marry &mdash;unless&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I were to meet <em>him</em>&mdash;free to make me his  wife.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She was weeping quietly, subdued, and  perhaps a shade more hopeful. Presently she flung her arms round Mary Harling&rsquo;s  neck. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me kiss you?&rdquo; she pleaded.  &ldquo;Now that you know what I am.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary kissed her warmly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my dear. Some day, perhaps,  when your life is happier, you will write and tell me. I shall be very glad to  know that all is well with you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t waste a thought upon the  wretched girl whose crying broke your night&rsquo;s rest. You have been very kind to  me, and I am not ungrateful. Or, sometimes, perhaps, when you open Hawthorne&rsquo;s  story, think of me for a moment.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall often think of you; and I want to  hear from you, years hence, when you have lived down your sorrow. But, oh, my  poor girl,&rdquo; Lady Mary went on, in a lower voice, &ldquo;if a living child is born to  you, don&rsquo;t withhold your love; don&rsquo;t try to put the innocent creature from you.  Try, as much as your surroundings will suffer you, to be a good mother.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The girl answered only with a hand-clasp. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she sobbed, and in the next  instant the cabin door was closed, and she had vanished out of Mary Harling&rsquo;s  life; or so Mary Harling thought. </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</strong> </h2>
<p>Lady Mary had made for herself  a dignified position in the most respectable section of English society, the  people whose country houses were built on land that their ancestors had won  from royal fear or favour before the Wars of the Roses, and whose town houses  had laid down red cloth for Frederick Prince of Wales, when Newcastle was  Premier, serious old houses in sober old streets, where the iron extinguishers  that flank the doorstep tell of lovely Devonshire&rsquo;s sedan chair and running  footmen, of the Gunnings and the Walpoles. Lady Mary&rsquo;s friends were the kind of  people who do not worship new money, or apologise for going to the  entertainments of Mammon &ldquo;for the sake of the music,&rdquo; or gobble June peaches  while they ridicule the providers of the feast. </p>
<p>Lady Mary&rsquo;s was a quiet world, in which people set  a tremendous value upon themselves, exaggerated no doubt, but still a kind of  self-respect that kept them out of unclean paths. Lady Mary&rsquo;s friends wanted to  know a great deal about everybody who crossed their sacred thresholds, or whose  thresholds they crossed. &ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where do they come  from?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The splendid house, the sumptuous  feasting, the costly music counted for nothing. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt they are very nice; but we don&rsquo;t  want to know them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That was the attitude of Lady Mary&rsquo;s  friends to the newly rich, and newly popular. </p>
<p>Writers, politicians,  actors, and artists of all kinds were admitted on their merits, and while they  were observed to behave themselves properly; but for the bad-mannered man, the  bounder or the cad, there was short shrift. Invited once, he was never asked  again. Unless he were well-born, and then bad manners were described as  eccentricity. The scions of great houses could not do wrong. </p>
<p>Lady  Mary had married a great shipbuilder. It was a low marriage, of course, but had  been tolerated on the ground of the man&rsquo;s unobtrusive manners, and a certain  grave dignity that might have become a duke. His father had been rich before  him, and the son had been reared among the salt of the earth, at Eton and  Oxford. Lady Mary was a duke&rsquo;s daughter, and had brought her mate ten thousand  pounds for <em>tout potage</em>, which was not a liberal portion  considering the Duke&rsquo;s wealth. John Harling could afford to brush aside the  ducal dower as a negligible quantity, when he dictated his marriage settlement.  He gave his wife a thousand a year for pin money, and when a mortal disease  came upon him, eleven years after his marriage, he left her fifteen thousand a  year during widowhood, to be reduced to five thousand if she married, and to  five hundred if she married a man ten years younger than herself. She was only  thirty when he made his will, with certain death near at hand, and he wanted to  guard her from the evil to come. He told himself that while her boy was young,  her plaything and her idol, she would not want to marry; but that later, in her  mature years, she might be a mark for the impecunious guardsman or the foreign  adventurer.</p>
<p>Lady Mary&rsquo;s portion came from funded  property; but her son inherited his father&rsquo;s interest in the great shipbuilding  firm, which had been made into a Limited Liability Company. With the  accumulations of a long minority, and the increasing prosperity of the  business, Conrad would have not less than thirty thousand a year when he came  of age; but before his twenty-first birthday Conrad Harling had been condemned  to imprisonment for life, and his fortune remained in the custody of his  trustees, who were men of position and impeccable honesty. </p>
<p>It was the worst kind of imprisonment, the  most hopeless, the most melancholy. Mental specialists, grave gentlemen from  Harley Street and Savile Row, had sat in judgment upon him, and had given their  gloomy verdict. For life! They could see no prospect of cure. It was one of  those cases of loss of memory which are of all phases of mental derangement the  most hopeless. It was not that something had gone mysteriously wrong with the  mental machinery, something that might come mysteriously right. The machine was  broken. The main spring of intelligence had snapped. The man remained a  magnificent man&mdash;a picture or a statue of splendid manhood; but the mind was  cancelled. </p>
<p>Doctors from Paris, doctors from Berlin  and Vienna, agreed with Harley Street and Savile Row. </p>
<p>Conrad Harling&mdash;he who had been so much  more alive than the ruck of men&mdash;was practically dead. He paced the leafy  avenues of a park at Roehampton, with a keeper at his side, though there was no  need of a keeper, for the house-surgeon&rsquo;s report described the young man as  &ldquo;harmless.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Harmless! He, to be so described, who at  twenty had been like Absalom in his beauty&mdash;like Hamlet in his distinction, &ldquo;the  observed of all observers, the glass of fashion and the mould of form.&rdquo; He who  had been a star at Eton and Christchurch, admired, followed, imitated, beloved,  an easy first in those accomplishments that youth worships, in one word an  Oxford Blue, stroke of the Christchurch eight, captain of the Christchurch  eleven. </p>
<p>On the scholastic side he had not done  wonders; but everybody knew that he was clever, and at twenty much might be  hoped from him. </p>
<p>He was his mother&rsquo;s idol. She lived only  to worship him, and to maintain the dignity, the reserve, the aloofness from  all unworthy people and paltry things, incumbent upon Conrad&rsquo;s mother. She  thought of herself almost as if she had been a Queen Regent, and regulated  every act of her life by Conrad&rsquo;s interests. She looked forward to his coming  of age as if it were to revolutionise the world, or at least to begin a new  chapter in English history. With his means, with his gifts, his splendid  presence, his happy self-assurance and spontaneous eloquence, to what heights  of statesmanship and parliamentary renown might he not aspire? She smiled when  his college tutor told her that he was irregular at lectures, and had very  little <em>go&ucirc;t</em> for Aristotle&mdash;or Greek tragedy. What did it matter to a  Heaven-born orator, who would take the House by storm, and recall the splendid  flights of that famous Charles Townshend described by Walpole, without  Townshend&rsquo;s failings? </p>
<p>He would come of age in a year. She had  begun to make plans, and to discuss the festivities, the banquets and  benefactions, the rural sports and wide-stretching hospitalities, that were to  make his twenty-first birthday memorable all over the county. She talked of  nothing else to her bailiff and house-steward, in her summer visit to Cranford. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my son&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; she reminded them.  &ldquo;I only occupy it by his courtesy, and when he marries I shall move to the  Grange.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Grange was on the other side of the  Park, and its gardens skirted the churchyard. It was Tudor and picturesque, and  handsomer than the average dower house; but Lady Mary felt as if she would be  laying down crown and sceptre when she left the great Georgian mansion and the  family portraits. She was full of brilliant ideas for the coming-of-age  festivities&mdash;Conrad&rsquo;s birthday was in August, the month of golden grain and  scarlet poppies, and orchards brimming over with red and amber fruit, the month  of fertility and rich colour, gaudy flowers, and crimson sunsets. Lady Mary  would have everything early English, a reminiscence of Frith&rsquo;s picture, &ldquo;Coming  of age in ye olden time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Her pet idea was a Maypole dance on the  village green, which was lovely and unspoilt by cockney influences. And the  Maypole might be left standing, and the young people encouraged to dance on  summer evenings. She had reformed the village Inn, which had thriven upon the  new system, and was a favourite shelter for cyclists and pedestrians, who were  sure of crisp loaves and succulent cheese, well-brewed tea and home-made jam,  at the &ldquo;Harling Arms.&rdquo; Everything in Lady Mary&rsquo;s dominion made for prettiness;  and her tenants and trades-people, and farm-labourers, had prospered  exceedingly during her gracious Regency. Nor was there any fear of evil times  when the King began his reign. Benevolence and kindness would be the order of  the day, sustained by an ever-increasing income from the famous Company in  which Conrad was the largest shareholder, with no more arduous duty than to sit  as Chairman at a half-yearly meeting, and draw his half-yearly dividends. </p>
<p>And then, perhaps, a few years after that  joyous festival, would come marriage, and another ringing of bells and  broaching of hogsheads. Lady Mary did not wish her son to marry till he was at  least four-and-twenty. She would indeed have chosen twenty-six or twenty-seven  as the marrying age, when he had seen the world, and had been in Parliament for  two or three years. She wanted him to be free from all domestic cares in the  beginning of his political career. Twenty-seven would be best. She knew of half  a dozen lovely girls, now in the nursery or schoolroom, girls born exactly as  she would wish her daughter-in-law to be born, in surroundings of unblemished  respectability, fortified by blue blood. For Lady Mary&rsquo;s son blue blood was  indispensable, although she had descended from her patrician perch in marrying  that excellent man, his father. </p>
<p>Having married Mr.  Harling she meant that the Harling money should secure a patrician wife for Mr.  Harling&rsquo;s son. The girls were growing up for him. He, who was so handsome and  attractive, so superlatively gifted in the accomplishments girls admire,  cricket, tennis, horsemanship, dancing, would have his choice among half a  dozen beauties in their first season. His mother meant to give him a free hand.  She would never dictate, she would not even suggest; but she would lead him  through gardens of fresh-blown roses, and let his eye and his heart choose the  flower that was to be the crown of his young life. </p>
<p>And while she was dreaming of her son&rsquo;s  marriage in his twenty-sixth year, Conrad Harling was going mad for love of an  innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter, and had turned socialist in his desire to level himself  down to her. He was a romantic young man, full of high-flown sentiments and  wild Quixotism; and he took up Karl Marx with an enthusiasm he  had refused to Aristotle. He gave vent to republican views in red-hot speeches  at the Union, reviled rank and state, and raved about the equal rights of men;  and he was firmly resolved upon marrying Stella Meadows, whose father kept the  &ldquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; a favourite resort for boating men. </p>
<p>Within a week of the long vacation, he  surprised and disappointed his mother by announcing that he meant to stay at  Abingdon and read, and do a good deal of rowing, so as to get himself in good  form for next year, when there was every chance of his being in the &rsquo;Varsity  eight. He would go to her for a day or two now and then, if she was at  Cranford, or would meet her in London, if she had any occasion to go there. </p>
<p>Lady Mary was sorry; but after all it was  important that he should prepare to face the examiners, and if he could do  better by himself in quiet riverside lodgings than touring in Wales or Scotland  with a reading party, his mother could have no objection. She did not expect to  enjoy much of his society in the &ldquo;Long.&rdquo; It was happiness enough to see him  occasionally, in high health and spirits, to accompany him on a round of  inspection on the estate, and to find him pleased with all she had done, intensely  interested in the stables and his stud of hunters, in the kennels where his  shooting dogs threatened to repeat the tragedy of Actaeon out of exuberant  love, in Lady Mary&rsquo;s herd of Jerseys, and even in so tame a thing&mdash;from the  masculine standpoint&mdash;as the gardens that were his mother&rsquo;s pride and joy.</p>
<p>But this year all was changed. He came. He  was kind, and interested in her health, and went with her wherever she asked  him, stables, farmyard, kennels, gardens: but it was too clear that all savour  had gone out of these familiar things. He would not even have the cloths taken  off his horses when they were brought out into the ancient quadrangle. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Brand,&rdquo; he told the  stud-groom, &ldquo;they look in fine condition.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He gave his adoring setters and spaniels  hardly three minutes, and left them disappointed, with great brown eyes looking  at him reproachfully, as he backed out of the old half-timbered building, where  they lived in the broken light from a window in the roof, through which the  sunshine came fitfully between the dusk of massive oak rafters. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Juno looked miserable when you wouldn&rsquo;t  notice her,&rdquo; his mother said, as they left the yard. </p>
<p>Conrad was not conscious of the reproach.  He hardly noticed anything, except in an automatic way that made his mother  unhappy. His mind was not there. His thoughts and interests were miles away.  What was amiss? Was it debt? His allowance was on the top scale of college  allowances, or a little above the highest scale. But the capacity of  undergraduates for getting into debt is supposed to be without limit, and  however much they have there is always the something more that they spend. </p>
<p>He had been losing money at cards perhaps;  or he had been backing a friend&rsquo;s horses; and he was ashamed to tell her. He  looked pale and careworn. Her heart went out to him with infinite pity. If it  had been possible for him to squander his fortune in one year of folly, to  mortgage every acre, and sell his patrimony to the Jews, and to reduce her to  beggary, his mother&rsquo;s power to love and pity would not have been exhausted. She  would have gone out of her ruined home with him, hand in hand, as Adam and Eve  went out of Eden, disconsolate but not reproachful. </p>
<p>She questioned him gently. She was sure  there was something on his mind, something that worried him, and had been  worrying him for some time. Would he not trust her? If he had lost money in  some rather foolish way he could draw on her for any sum he wanted to make  things square, without troubling his trustees. She had a good balance at her  bankers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear old mother,&rdquo; he exclaimed, and  he spoke with more animation than he had shown hitherto. &ldquo;No, I have not outrun  the constable; though I did spend more last term than I generally spend&mdash;not  betting&mdash;no, dear. It went upon trifles, foolish things&mdash;but no harm.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know you have something serious on  your mind, Conrad.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a fellow ought to have something to  think of besides the college boat. There is nothing wrong, nothing that need  trouble you when you are on your knees. But you have hit the mark. I have been  thinking of something serious.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the church?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Turn parson? No, you dear  simpleton. That&rsquo;s not in my line. Don&rsquo;t be impatient, mother. There shall be no  secrets between you and me. But you must let me take my own time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He smiled down at her. His face had grown  suddenly radiant with the look she loved. She called it his noble look, an  expression in which she saw truth and courage and honour, and all good gifts  that well-born youth should have. A light flashed into her mind. </p>
<p>Conrad was in love; in love before his  time, seven years before the date that her sagacious mind had allotted for his  marriage. Some pretty sister of one of his Oxford friends had caught his  youthful fancy; perhaps a nobody&rsquo;s pretty sister; a country vicar&rsquo;s daughter,  one of many. </p>
<p>But even if it were so it could but be  calf-love, a boy&rsquo;s first  fancy for a lovely face, or a face that seemed lovely to that ardent young  imagination. Such loves are light as children&rsquo;s soap bubbles, look as dazzling  in their iridescent glory, and melt and pass like them. She was not going to  fret herself if her beloved boy had taken first love, like measles or a  complaint that had to be got through somehow. Her only regret was that the  youthful malady seemed to have taken a gloomy form; he was out of spirits,  absent-minded, too evidently worried and perplexed. </p>
<p>Even a mother&rsquo;s solicitude under-estimated  the evil. For a young man of Conrad&rsquo;s impassioned temperament first love must  be disastrous if it be not happy. With him love began at fever point. From the  hour he made the acquaintance of the prosperous Innkeeper&rsquo;s petted daughter  overdressed, educated up to the highest all-round smattering point, kept aloof  from the bar and its vulgarities, chaperoned by a spinster aunt who never  snubbed an eligible undergraduate, but rather contrived those casual  introductions that can be brought about so easily on the river, where there is  always some kind of excitement and something of a festal air. And one  undergraduate having somehow introduced himself to aunt and niece, was able to  introduce others, till the heiress of the &ldquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; had her following of  nice boys, and was established as an acknowledged beauty. </p>
<p>She was very pretty, in the first  freshness of girlhood. She had that exquisite purity of colouring, a fairness  as of Madonna lilies, from which the idea of virginal innocence seems  inseparable. The sensitive complexion, with its quick blushes, the lucid blue  of the large wondering eyes, shining through golden lashes, the flaxen hair,  all had an angelic character which was so out of harmony with coquetry and  slyness that no experience of her cruelty or her want of truth could shake the  lad&rsquo;s faith, or startle him from his dream of bliss. </p>
<p>He had known her something less than half  a year, and he had been made to suffer every pang which slighted love can feel,  every joy that love triumphant can taste. Her smiles and kisses, her frowns and  coldness, the moonlit nights when she would stroll with him in dewy lanes amid  the subtle scent of hedgerow flowers, and fields of blossoming beans, his arm  enfolding her slight form, his eyes drinking the beauty of her face, angelic in  the magical moonlight. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My angel, my wife!&rdquo; he would murmur in  those blissful moments, the heavenly interludes in which he thought she loved  him. </p>
<p>Never for one brief flash had his mind  harboured a thought dishonouring her. That she could ever be anything less than  his wife, the first and most precious of women, was impossible. She was his  first and last love. A passion that had mastered heart and mind, a passion that  shut out every other thought, and made existence one long dream of the woman he  loved, such a passion could have no second. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is once and for ever,&rdquo; he said, when  she told him that he would go away and forget her. </p>
<p>He had spent the greater part of his  college allowance on jewels to deck his divinity; but here that cold  commonsense which sometimes chilled him, as out of harmony with the angelic,  came into play. She would accept the gifts of her future husband; but she would  not wear them as the daughter of the &ldquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head.&rdquo; People would laugh at  pearls and diamonds on an innkeeper&rsquo;s girl, she told him. She was not elated at  the idea of marrying him; indeed there were times when she told him their  marriage was a foolish dream, that would never be realised. She was a creature  of moods and fancies, capricious, unreasonable; and she kept him under the  harrow by her cold fits and hot fits, her hours of yielding love, her hours of  coldness and restraint. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>So determined was he upon having her and only her to share his  fortune and rule his life, that, in opposition to her wish, he called upon the  landlord of the &ldquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; and made a formal offer of his hand.</p>
<p>The man received the flattering  proposition gravely, and with something of embarrassment. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a serious thing for a gentleman like  you to think of marrying a publican&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re very  young, sir, to make up your mind about marriage: hardly of age yet, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be twenty-one next year, and I  have made up my mind.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Stella? She&rsquo;s a bit of a  flirt, you must know, though I say it as shouldn&rsquo;t. Are you quite sure of her?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She gave me her promise last night.  It was not the first time: but it was the first time I felt sure, quite sure  that she loves me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>His face was radiant as he remembered  those impassioned vows. All her capricious moods, her slights, her coldness  were forgotten. She had given him unmistakable tokens of a love fervid as his  own. Her arms had been round his neck, her lovely head nestling upon his  shoulder, and heart had been beating against heart in passionate unison, while  that fond vow was spoken. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife, dearest, never any man&rsquo;s wife  but yours, never, never, never!&rdquo; </p>
<p>And then had come a flood of tears, and  stormy sobs that threatened hysteria; and it had been his tender care to soothe  her shaken nerves, to comfort her with happy talk about their future. </p>
<p>And now her father, who might naturally be  supposed to receive such an offer with gratification, if not astonishment,  discussed the situation with a troubled brow and perplexed manner. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s a great chance for my  girl,&rdquo; he said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;everybody knows Mr. Harling. Why, I remember  your father, sir, thirty years ago, when he was at  Christchurch&mdash;a famous scholar, I believe.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my father took a much better degree  than his son is likely to take.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that, sir. He never had your  form on the river. But to return to my girl. Does your ma know of your  intentions?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. She will know in good time; and  I have no doubt of her approval, when she sees Stella. She is the kindest of  women, and her only wish is for my happiness.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, sir, it don&rsquo;t often happen for a  gentleman of your wealth and position&mdash;your ma with a handle to her name, I&rsquo;m  told&mdash;to marry a girl out of a pub. I&rsquo;m afraid her ladyship might cut up rough,  and make it unpleasant for you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to trouble yourself  about that,&rdquo; Conrad said, with a touch of hauteur. &ldquo;I mean to marry Stella  within a week of my coming of age. That will give time for my mother to know  and appreciate my future wife. You see I am not going to work in a hot-headed  way; but it was only right that you should be told of your daughter&rsquo;s  engagement, and should have no doubt as to the propriety of her conduct when  you happen to see her, or to hear of her, in my company.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Innkeeper was somewhat moved by this  speech. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a trump, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish  there was more like you. And&mdash;and you&rsquo;re a great catch for my girl; and I hope  she&rsquo;ll prove worthy of her luck&mdash;but she&rsquo;s very young, and she&rsquo;s been a bit  giddy. You see she&rsquo;s out and away the prettiest girl between Oxford and  Abingdon, and the undergrads, and &mdash;and&mdash;others have made a fool of her. She lost  her mother when she was eleven years old, and I&rsquo;ve been too busy to look after  her much. I sent her to the best school I could hear of&mdash;a boarding-school for  gentlemen&rsquo;s daughters. It was a favour to take her, but the school wasn&rsquo;t doing  well, and went bankrupt soon after. She kicked over the traces a bit at  school&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t stand the rules and regulations. And then I got my maiden  sister to come and take care of her; but my sister&rsquo;s a feather-head. She was  something of a beauty herself in her time, and was made so much of that she could  never bring herself to accept a husband in her own walk of life: and I don&rsquo;t  know whether she has been quite the best sort of person to look after Stella.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Stella has too much self-respect to want  looking after,&rdquo; Conrad said. </p>
<p>He knew the aunt, and considered her a  foolish person; but he believed in his divinity&rsquo;s intelligence; as he believed  in her purity. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, if you really intend to make  Stella your wife in a twelvemonth from now, I should like, with all deference,  to offer you a bit of advice. Let me send her away from Oxford, and the river,  and the class of people that hang about my house. I&rsquo;ve kept her out of the  business. She never drew a glass of beer in her life; but there it is, you may  call a public-house an hotel and furnish your sitting-rooms up to date, but  public-house it is all the same. We must get Stella out of it. You&rsquo;ll want her  made a lady before you marry her and there&rsquo;s only one way that it can be done;  as far as I can see. She was eighteen on her last birthday; so she&rsquo;s not too  old for a good finishing-school, a school where they teach deportment and such  like. If you&rsquo;ll find out where there is such a school&mdash;Leamington, perhaps&mdash;or in  the neighbourhood of Reading&mdash;an out and out good school, where the  schoolmistress is a real lady, and can be depended on, I&rsquo;ll send Stella there  for a year. I don&rsquo;t mind what it costs. I want to make a lady of her, and to  get her away from people I don&rsquo;t like. That&rsquo;s flat!&rdquo; </p>
<p>He thumped his honest fist upon the table,  and spoke with a determination that startled Conrad. It was as if a doctor were  proposing some heroic treatment in a desperate case. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate the idea of schoolmistresses. They  would make her prim and artificial. They would kill the charm of my wild rose.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have her made a lady, sir. She  mustn&rsquo;t stop here.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Conrad argued the point sturdily, but  Stella&rsquo;s father was resolute. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m about,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The  &lsquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head&rsquo; is no place for her. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get her away for the  last six months; and now I&rsquo;ll do it. It&rsquo;ll be the&mdash;making of her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He was going to say the saving of her&mdash;but  chose the less ominous word. </p>
<p>Conrad had to  submit. He told Stella of the plan, in their evening walk. She was angry with  her father, and contemptuous about his views. She was angry with her lover for  consenting to degrade her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think I am ignorant, that I  pronounce words wrong, and am not fit to mix with genteel people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He soothed and petted her, told her she  was his ideal lady, but she must not talk of people being &ldquo;genteel.&rdquo; She had  better forget that there was such a word in the language. There was nothing  derogatory in a finishing school. It was not his idea, but her father&rsquo;s. For  his own part he would not have her changed in the most trifling detail. If  there were some little differences between her and the girls he had met  elsewhere, those slight divergencies only made her more fascinating. </p>
<p>She listened, and was soothed, and  appeared to agree to her father&rsquo;s plan. </p>
<p>He left her in hot haste to discover the  ideal seminary in which just that last polishing process might be applied to  the lovely statue. Just the artistic treatment that would embellish without  altering his goddess. He took the first train to London and went about among  the few immaculate matrons with whom he was on friendly terms, surprising them  by his eagerness for information on a subject that seemed hardly within the  range of his interests. </p>
<p>Three out of five knew nothing of schools,  and shuddered at the notion of anything but home education for so precious a  being as a girl-child. The other two knew hard cases of Anglo-Indian children  who had to be brought up at school, and each had her pet establishment, her  incomparable Misses, who could create the perfection of girlhood out of the  most unpromising material. </p>
<p>Two of the  incomparable Misses had a handsome house and gardens at Eastbourne, &ldquo;quite away  from the town and the Parade, and all the holiday people, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; </p>
<p>An abode of refined dulness, Conrad  imagined, where a pupil might die of ennui without ever having run against a  vulgar person. The back windows commanded a distant view of the grounds of  Compton Place. This in itself gave a cachet. </p>
<p>Nobody happened to know of any  establishment at Leamington or Reading. </p>
<p>Conrad tore down to Eastbourne by cab and  train, catching the afternoon express with a rush, and drove in a fly to  Mandeville House, where Miss Mandeville and Miss Amelia Mandeville fostered all  that was delectable in girlhood, and eliminated every weed in their garden of  girls. </p>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon, and the plain  white house facing south-west was glorified, every scarlet stripe in the  Spanish blinds a flash of intense colour, the lawns and geranium beds dazzling.  Nowhere did he remember to have seen such purple clematis, such amber roses, such scarlet  cannas. Everything was steeped in sunlight. It was the kind of afternoon that  raises an English landscape to the colour-point of Italy. </p>
<p>Girls were playing tennis, their white  frocks flashing in the sun&mdash;their joy in the game breaking into peals of light  laughter. Miss Amelia Mandeville took him round the house and the grounds.  Everywhere he found perfection, the desires and the ways of girls studied with  a forethought and sympathy that surprised him. He had supposed that  schoolmistresses considered girlhood their natural enemy, and took infinite  pains to traverse and stifle girlish instincts. Here infinite pains had been  taken to realise every wish, and gratify every natural taste. Beauty was the  dominant note. The spinsters had eyes for form and colour, and a catholicity of  taste in all things beautiful. </p>
<p>The house stood on high ground, half a  mile from the coast, and the sea beheld from afar was a glorified sea, sapphire  and gold against the verdant middle distance. Everything pleased Conrad. </p>
<p>Surely his dearest girl would be happy  there&mdash; for the year of their engagement&mdash;only one little year before she would  be mistress of his home, and all that home implies for a man of large means.  Yes, assuredly she would be happy. The change from those unworthy surroundings  at the &ldquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; would make this place seem paradise. </p>
<p>He remembered that there were details,  small differences, in her forms of speech, that wanted refining away. For him  all she said was enchanting; but the women among whom his wife would have to  live are critical about trifles. They have their shibboleth; and if they talk  bad English it must be their own kind of bad English. Upon accent they are to  the last degree intolerant; and they would boycott an angel with a cockney  twang. And there were accents of Stella&rsquo;s that touched the boundary line of  vulgarity, when she was angry or excited. Conrad began to think highly of his  future father-in-law&rsquo;s wisdom. Of course it must be <em>his</em> privilege to  pay the charges of Mandeville House, which were on a scale in accordance with  the luxuries and refinements of the establishment. </p>
<p>He rushed back to Oxford by a night train,  too late to visit his enchantress. He lay awake thinking of her, picturing her  among those happy girls he had seen on the tennis lawn, the fairest where all  were fair, the most divine. </p>
<p>He went to the &ldquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; in the early  morning before breakfast. She was not an early riser, but perhaps she might  feel some of his own impatience for their meeting, after his absence of one  long day; and she might be curious to hear his account of the ideal seminary  that was to make her as perfect in speech and manner as she was exquisite in  personal charm. </p>
<p>The Innkeeper met him with a scared white  face. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some bad news for you, sir,&rdquo; he  said. </p>
<p>He led the young man into his den behind  the bar, the room where he kept his accounts, and where he sat of an evening,  with a crony or two, or with his solitary pipe, while his daughter and her aunt  were in their drawing-room upstairs, where they could have their own visitors,  aloof from vulgarity. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone.  She&rsquo;s gone, sir&mdash;cut and run&mdash; the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>His speech closed huskily with a hideous  epithet that was doubly horrible when linked with the name of his daughter; and  then, for the first time since he entered into his fool&rsquo;s paradise, Conrad  Harling was told what kind of woman he had loved. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t  seem a father&rsquo;s place to give her away,&rdquo; the Innkeeper said, &ldquo;but I spoke as  plain as I dared. And I thought that having been lucky enough to meet with a  gentleman of your metal, willing to make a lady of her, she&rsquo;d have turned over  a new leaf. I never thought she&rsquo;d have anything more to do with him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And then Conrad learnt that he had a  rival, and such a rival! A prize-fighter, the champion middle-weight, famous in  the sporting world, an olive-skinned gladiator, with close-cropped hair of raven  blackness, a blue chin, a broken nose, and a drunken wife. He had come to  Abingdon for a holiday, while he was out of training, and he had stayed at the  &ldquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; the centre of an admiring company, an attraction to the jovial  bar, a profitable guest. </p>
<p>Conrad had seen him sculling in the  sunshine, the muscular arms bare to the shoulder, the supple form shining like  pale bronze. </p>
<p>This was the man she loved, the master she  obeyed, the brute-force that had subjugated her trivial nature, while the young  undergraduate&rsquo;s passion had only flattered her vanity. </p>
<p>She had left her father&rsquo;s house in the  early morning, and had gone to Liverpool with her rough lover, on the first  stage of their flight to America, where the pugilist had a profitable  engagement. The drunken wife was left in an Oxford slum, and Stella&rsquo;s letter,  posted on the journey, told her father what she had made of her life. </p>
<p>She was leaving England, perhaps for ever,  with the only man she had ever loved. They would be married in America, where  he could easily get a divorce, and where he would be a rich man. </p>
<p>Conrad listened in a stony silence. All  the life had gone out of his bloodless face. His eyes &mdash;those splendid blue eyes&mdash;had  become dull and expressionless. He stood with Stella&rsquo;s letter in his hand,  staring at the words as if they had no meaning. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I see her aunt?&rdquo; he asked at last.  &ldquo;She knows more than you do, perhaps.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, curse her. She knows more than  enough. She can tell me now that it&rsquo;s too late. They always do, those women. If  ever I had a dishonest barman they&rsquo;d tell me about him fast enough when he was  gone. It&rsquo;s a way they have, curse them. They&rsquo;re a bad lot, sir, every one of  &rsquo;em, rotten to the core.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He threw his cloth cap at his favourite  bull terrier, and then mixed a stiff brandy and soda. It was easy to guess  where this bereft father would look for consolation. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a drink, sir?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll go and see your sister.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He knew his way to the gaudy little  upstairs room, facing the river, the room in which he had spent many an hour  with aunt and niece, a favoured visitor. The crochet antimacassars and stuffed trout  and pike, the beaded reed blinds and blue ginger-jars, the mixture of early  Victorian and cheap Japanese had set his teeth on edge, even in Stella&rsquo;s  bewitching company, and he had yearned to see her in the grave old rooms at  Cranford, the rooms where things of beauty, curios, porcelain, pictures, hardly  counted in the effect of panelled walls and Adam doors and mantelpieces, and  all the glory of cedar-shadowed lawns and Italian garden. He found the elder  Miss Meadows with swollen eyelids, and every sign of tribulation, but loquacious  in her grief. She covered herself with reproaches, and gave him no time to  blame her, had he been disposed to do so. Even amidst her incoherence he heard  only too much, heard how the sweet simplicity he had adored was the varnish of  an unscrupulous coquette, how she had &ldquo;carried on&rdquo;&mdash;that was the aunt&rsquo;s  phrase&mdash;with Mr. So-and-So of Balliol, and Lord So-and-So of Brasenose, how the  carryings on had begun when she was sixteen, and how it was only by reason of  her aunt&rsquo;s prudential measures that worse things had not happened.</p>
<p>Conrad had to listen while she expatiated  upon Stella&rsquo;s artfulness and let in strange lights upon the career of a  plebeian beauty. The presents, the treats, the carrying on! Those arms that had  clung round his neck so tenderly, the dimpled cheek that had pressed against  his own, those exquisite lips whose fragrance he had drunk, were the hackneyed  charms of a lowbred wanton. </p>
<p>He heard that cataract of vulgar speech in  a strange silence. He looked as he had looked in the Innkeeper&rsquo;s snuggery, like  flesh turned into stone. Except to ask to see this woman he had hardly spoken  since he came into the house. He made no comment upon the story she told him.  He went out of the house in the same frozen silence, and walked away with his  face to the west, and the towered city of Oxford saw him no more. </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</strong></h2>
<p>As Conrad had been living in lodgings, and  was supposed to have been reading, his disappearance made no stir. The ways of  undergraduates in vacation being erratic, Mr. Harling&rsquo;s landlady supposed that  her agreeable lodger had gone to his own people on the whim of the moment, and  had not considered it necessary to inform her of his movements. The fact of his  having taken no luggage was easily explained in the supposition that he had  gone home. It was not till after four letters with the Cranford Park address on  the envelopes had been followed by a flight of telegrams at three-hour  intervals, that the lady of the riverside villa took fright. </p>
<p>She telegraphed to the lady of Cranford  Park, whose photograph in an ivory frame stood on the book table in Conrad&rsquo;s  deserted sitting-room: </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Mr. Harling left here on Wednesday  morning, September 7th.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>She followed the telegram with a letter in  which she described the suddenness of her lodger&rsquo;s departure, and how, on  account of her experience of undergraduate ways, she had attached no importance  to the fact. </p>
<p>Then came for Lady Mary Harling a period  of harrowing anxiety such as happily is rare in the tragedy of domestic life.  Her son had disappeared from the world of living creatures. The river, or the  railroad, or the woods and solitary places round Oxford, might hide the tragic  close of that young life; but those graves of youth and hope, those last  refuges of despair, refused to give up their secret. The most indefatigable  search, persevered in without rest or respite for five weary weeks, the  investigations of trained investigators, men who had graduated in Scotland Yard  and retired upon private practice full of knowledge and experience, could make  nothing of the case of Conrad Harling. </p>
<p>The investigators were somewhat  handicapped by the instructions of their client, for in the midst of her grief  Lady Mary had been so much a woman of the world as to stipulate that the search  for her son should be carried on with the utmost secrecy. No detail, no  suggestion of the tragedy was to find its way to the newspaper press; and thus  the clues that are most often furnished by the outside public were wanting to  her private police. Not even her most intimate friends knew that her son was  missing. Even the college dons were left in the dark. Her agents opined that <em>they</em> could afford  no assistance. </p>
<p>Five weeks of agonising suspense, of  sleepless nights, or briefest slumbers made horrible by visions of death, and  then came a summons to a little seaport town in North Cornwall, where in a  humble inn, the resort of sailors and fishermen, a young man had been found  whose appearance corresponded with her son&rsquo;s photograph, and whose presence in  that locality had given rise to considerable curiosity. </p>
<p>Lady Mary received this summons in  Hertford Street, where she had been living throughout these weeks of trouble,  in order to be within easy reach of her agents. </p>
<p>The telegram came in time for her to start  in the eleven o&rsquo;clock express for Padstow, accompanied by Daisy Meredith, her  only confidant, who insisted on going with her; and in the golden evening  sunlight she was sitting in the Inn parlour, alone with her son. He sat by her  side; he let her hold his hand; he let her kiss him; but he kept a stony  silence, and his eyes looked at her with a vacant stare. </p>
<p>He was quite mad. </p>
<p>His mother was told the story of his  coming to that place in rags, with his shoes worn off his feet, and in  appearance a tramp, but with a valuable watch, and a handful of gold and silver  in his pocket. He had a gaunt and hungry look, and was footsore. A doctor had  been called in by the Innkeeper, and had pronounced him mad, but harmless. His  madness might be only temporary, a passing cloud. He had been living at the  little inn for a month, wandering about on the hills or lying on the beach all  day. The Innkeeper had bought ready-made clothes, and other necessaries for him  with some of the money found upon him, and had done all that could be done to  make him comfortable; but his silence made a barrier between him and the outer  world. He sat among the noisy company in the Inn parlour when the room was full  of talk and laughter, thick with the smoke of seafaring pipes, sat in a corner  by the projecting chimney, not heeding them. He ate the food that was put  before him, but showed no preferences, no desires. </p>
<p>The Innkeeper  sent a lad to watch him when he roamed about the hills, lest he should try to  make away with himself&mdash;but he had shown no suicidal impulses. He only wandered  aimlessly, or sat staring at the sea. Why he had made his way to that  particular spot and why he stayed there who could tell? </p>
<p>His mother asked no questions. She clasped  her living son in her arms, the son she had thought of among the dead, and this  was much. She took possession of him. The local doctor got her an attendant  from Plymouth, and she carried her son to London, and installed him in his own  rooms in Hertford Street, never to part with him till the wound in that  beautiful mind was healed, and he was again a free man and master of his life.  She made up her mind that he should never know the restraints that other mental  sufferers know. She would be his nurse and his keeper. This was Lady Mary&rsquo;s  plan, but unhappily it did not work. She had to yield to scientific opinion. He  would be better away from her. Whatever chance of recovery there might be, and  her advisers did not hide from her that the chance was small, his residence  under her roof, the restrictions of his life while he was an unacknowledged  lunatic, would lessen that chance. The constant supervision of experienced  doctors and nurses was necessary for his welfare. Love could do little for him,  love that he did not recognise or understand. </p>
<p>Lady Mary yielded to medical opinion,  after a hard struggle. It was true that her love could do nothing for him. He did  not notice her coming or going. She sat beside him for hours without winning  one glance of recognition. </p>
<p>She had heard the story of his love  madness, from the landlord of the &ldquo;Otter&rsquo;s Head.&rdquo; She knew that the fever of  one brief summer&mdash;a lad&rsquo;s extravagant passion for worthless beauty&mdash;had withered  his young life. </p>
<p>A wanton&rsquo;s perfidy had killed the happy  boy whose path lay in the sunshine, for whom she had anticipated a life of fame  and gladness. All God&rsquo;s good gifts, nature&rsquo;s lavish bounty, were turned to dust  and ashes. </p>
<p>One consideration that influenced Lady  Mary was the better chance of keeping her son&rsquo;s secret if he were hidden in a  private asylum, lost sight of by the outside world, a unit in the sum of sorrow  enclosed by the walls of the spacious wooded grounds surrounding a house on the  edge of Putney Heath. So near London that it would be easy for her to visit  him, and yet so secluded and aloof from the busy world that no one need  discover his retreat. A physician of experience and position was at the head of  the establishment, and the system and details were the highest outcome of  modern science and modern thought. Nowhere could this martyr of a foolish  love-dream be better cared for; and if his reason should some day awaken from  the long apathy of melancholy madness, no one need know how the interval in his  life had been spent. It would be easy for his mother to tell her friends that  he was a traveller in far-away places, in Central Africa, Central Asia,  anywhere. Such wanderings are the natural diversions of youth and wealth. </p>
<p>Lady Mary, for whom truthfulness was an  instinct, taught herself the delicate art of lying, and in the earlier years of  her son&rsquo;s seclusion that new learning came into play, for she was often  questioned about him, most of all in the first year. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why had he left the &rsquo;Varsity?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys are so erratic,&rdquo; she said, and,  having found that phrase, she used it freely to answer for everything. </p>
<p>Her son was all that was good and dear,  but he was erratic. Central Africa was his passion. She never knew where he was  at any moment of her life. Yes, of course, she admitted, in reply to friendly  questions, he wrote to her sometimes; but the postal arrangements of Uganda  were not quite perfect. No, she was not unhappy about him. She knew how steady  he was, how brave, how clever. Yes, naturally he had companions; he was not a  solitary wanderer. </p>
<p>And so this martyr of maternal love spoke  of her son while the empty shell, the simulacrum of that which was once her  son, was pacing the avenue at Roehampton, or sitting in the sunshine, dead in  life, the mere mechanical life of pulses that beat and limbs that can move. </p>
<p>She went to see him two or three times a  week, when she was in London, and sat with him in his pretty parlour, where the  French windows faced south, and opened on a gracious flower-garden. He never  recognised her. He had no occupations, no tastes, no desires. The days came and  went and made no change in him. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>The summer after Lady Mary&rsquo;s autumn voyage  to Ceylon, there came a gleam of hope. </p>
<p>Conrad had taken a fancy to one of the  doctor&rsquo;s dogs, a handsome Irish setter. It was the first thing animate or  inanimate that his eyes had rested on with interest since he entered that sad  world. He patted the dog, and coaxed her to follow him to his room. One day he  called her Juno, the name of his favourite at Cranford. </p>
<p>That was the first ray of memory. </p>
<p>The doctor told Lady Mary that he saw in  this a faint hope of ultimate cure. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if the machine might work  again!&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Even this  faint hope was much. </p>
<p>The setter became Conrad&rsquo;s constant  companion, walked with him, ate with him, slept upon his bed, and his interest  in her never diminished. But with his mother he remained cold and  unrecognising. Once, indeed, while she was sitting with him, he looked at her,  and then pointed to the dog; but he spoke no word. This was the second summer  after the winter in Ceylon. </p>
<p>She went to Italy in the autumn, and spent  a quiet contemplative winter in the old cities, Perugia, Verona, Bologna,  Siena, studying art and architecture with Daisy Meredith, who was always ready  to take up any study, to be interested in even any fad, an admirable companion,  with a bright mind that caught fire at a spark. </p>
<p>It was while she was at Siena, and before  the trunks were packed for home, that there came a letter from Roehampton&mdash;a  letter that changed the colour of Lady Mary&rsquo;s existence. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son&rsquo;s mental condition has made such  marked improvement within the last month that I think I may now venture to give  you every hope of his recovery. His brain has awakened from the lethargy that  has so long obscured his consciousness of the outer world, and from the hour when he first noticed the  house-surgeon&rsquo;s dog there has been a gradual revival of his intelligence, which  within the last month has advanced by leaps and bounds. You will be astonished  at the change, and, though I would not advise his return to active life for  some time to come, I have the strongest faith in his being ultimately able to  resume his proper place in society.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Two days after reading this letter Mary  Harling was at Roehampton. </p>
<p>It was a lovely afternoon in April, and  the beeches and elms, and wide lawns, and beds of tulips, were glorified in the  sunshine, and seemed scarcely less beautiful to the mother&rsquo;s eager eyes than  the land of blossoming chestnuts and trailing vines through which the train <em>de  luxe</em> had carried her, speeding homeward, with her thoughts one  perpetual thanksgiving to God for her son&rsquo;s deliverance. </p>
<p>She stood at the French window in Conrad&rsquo;s  sitting-room and saw him coming towards her across the lawn, alert and active,  with rapid step and happy face, handsomer than in his boyhood, his dog leaping  about him. </p>
<p>They clasped hands, and he kissed her in  the old boyish way. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear mother!&rdquo; </p>
<p>She could not speak. She was almost  fainting; but she was just able to get to a chair and sit down, with her son  beside her. The setter made a diversion, by thrusting herself between them,  jealous of the stranger. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You are as fond as ever of Juno?&rdquo; Lady  Mary said, and these were the first words she could find. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear thing, but her name isn&rsquo;t  Juno, though I call her by the old name now and then. This one is Flirt, Madame  Flirt.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The dog&rsquo;s paws were on his shoulders, and  his face was being violently licked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Juno alive still?&rdquo; he asked presently,  and the question told his mother that he knew of the lapse of years. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is flourishing, poor old dear!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be very old!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen last birthday.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember. She was five the year I  went to Christ Church.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There came a silence. His mother&rsquo;s eyes  were clouded with tears as she looked at him, and it was impossible for her to  repress all signs of agitation; but he was perfectly calm. His eyes had a  thoughtful look, serenely meditative. </p>
<p>Lady Mary looked round the room he had  lived in during those weary years. His table was loaded with books, and there  was his old Eton desk which she had sent there, hopeless of his ever using it,  now open and with sheets of manuscript scattered about it. She looked at the  books, Darwin, Wallace, Tyndall, Clodd, and several new books on electricity. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have taken up science!&rdquo; she said,  full of wonder. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a new world for me. The house doctor here is a dab at electrical  science&mdash;and we have long jaws together.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hope you indulge yourself with a  little light literature, Thackeray, Dickens, and the poets you were so fond  of.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;They are by my bedside&mdash;my close  companions. I have a good deal of leisure for reading, you see, now I have gone  back to books.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And you take plenty of exercise.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I play lawn tennis or croquet whenever  the weather is possible, and court tennis every day. Of course you know we have  a tennis court.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You look in splendid health.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I am in splendid health. The  head boss here says I ought to join you in your autumn trip&mdash;India, Ceylon, or  wherever your dear old fogies send you, for your asthma. Would you like that,  mother, or would you think me a bore?&rdquo; </p>
<p>This was more than Mary Harling could  stand. She burst into tears, that kept her speechless for some minutes.</p>
<p>The house doctor seemed to have been  within earshot of her sobs, the windows being all open in the soft spring  weather. He came in through the verandah and carried Lady Mary and her son to  his own den, where he gave them tea, and where the conversation touched only on  the lightest and pleasantest topics, with many inquiries about Lady Mary&rsquo;s  winter travels, the pictures she had seen, Juliet&rsquo;s grave, historical Verona,  the Cathedral at Siena, the old Palace at Perugia. </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5 </strong></h2>
<p>Conrad Harling&rsquo;s cure was as  complete as it had been rapid. He was like a creature new born. His physical  powers had been garnered in the house of bondage. </p>
<p>Extreme care had been taken of his health  during those years when the mind was frozen. Proper exercise had been insisted  upon, slouching habits had been prevented. Every means that modern science could  devise to keep the bodily machine in splendid working order had been employed:  if this unhappy young man was to have only an automatic existence that life  should be the best of its kind. His doctors were profoundly interested in him,  as a remarkable case, a man whose mind had been killed by one sudden grief, a  passionate young heart which had loved with such fiery ardour that the ruin of  his love had been the ruin of his mind. </p>
<p>No one at Roehampton had believed in his  chances of recovery, and his cure made him doubly interesting as a case. </p>
<p>The head physician discussed the situation  gravely with Lady Mary. </p>
<p>She had kept no particular of her son&rsquo;s  foolish passion from him. She had told him all that she had learnt in a long  interview with Meadows and his spinster sister. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a very fine brain,&rdquo; the doctor  told her, &ldquo;and all the best qualities of manhood, pluck, resolution, presence  of mind, energy, perseverance. I have observed him carefully, since he has been  practically a sane man; and I have the highest admiration for his character, a <em>preux  chevalier</em>, as every youngster of good birth and fortune, who has  never known the seamy side of life, ought to be. But he has a highly emotional  temperament You&rsquo;ll wonder how I find that out perhaps, seeing what a  passionless thing life is in this place. Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. His dog&mdash;that  brown setter he&rsquo;s so fond of&mdash; was ill. The vet. thought she was going to die. I  saw despair in your son&rsquo;s face&mdash;yes&mdash;a grief that was almost despair.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My tender-hearted boy!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to be very careful of him.  An unhappy love affair in the morning of life made a wreck of him. You must do  all you can to guard against a second shipwreck. He will go back to the world  still in the flower of his strength, handsome, attractive, a magnetic young  man. He will inevitably fall in love again&mdash;and if his love is a happy one his  future will be secure. Marriage will be his safest harbour. With a wife he  loves he will escape the dangers of imagination and temperament.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope he will make a happy marriage.  I know more than one sweet girl who would be a sweet wife.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And then Lady Mary&rsquo;s brow clouded with  anxious thought. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not think it would be wrong for  him to marry?&rdquo; she asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. There is nothing in his case to  forbid marriage&mdash;nothing in his history. His mental upset was an accident. But  we are going to make very sure that his recovery is complete&mdash;before he goes  back to the world. If you and he are to winter abroad I should advise some  quiet place, out of the beaten track, where he may have time to take up the  dropped threads of existence, and to accustom himself to contact with  strangers, where strangers are few. I have no fear for him. He is a splendid  fellow.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And if&mdash;half a year hence&mdash;you find his  mental health established would it be necessary to tell the secret of those sad  years to the girl he might want to marry or to her people?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The doctor reflected gravely. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you might ignore that history  without compunction.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This opinion relieved Lady Mary&rsquo;s mind.  She felt she had not lied in vain. </p>
<p>She had all the summer in which to  consider her winter abode. Conrad stayed at Roehampton, with an interval of  three weeks at a sea-coast village in Devonshire, untrodden by the tourist,  where he went with his mother, and the house doctor who had become his  particular friend. The doctor wanted a holiday, and he went as the young man&rsquo;s  comrade rather than his medical adviser. </p>
<p>Here Mary Harling had the delight of  seeing her son in the plenitude of mental and bodily health, rejoicing in his  strength, like a young giant, spending long days sailing a ten ton yacht, or  tramping over the hills with the doctor, making friends with the fishermen and  coastguards, interested in every living creature and in every aspect of nature,  as he had been in his early boyhood when all the world was new. </p>
<p>It was the miracle of a mind recreated, a  mind that revelled in a world whose beauty had been forgotten in that long  slumber of the brain, and where every common spectacle of nature seemed a thing  of wonder. The purple of those heather-clad hills, the ineffable glory of those  sunsets on the edge of the western sea, the flowers in cottage gardens, the  gold hair and blue eyes of peasant children, the rugged beauty of tawny-visaged  fishermen, splendid in their rough strength&mdash;&ldquo;the earth and every common sight,&rdquo;  filled this new mind with joy. </p>
<p>And then there was that other world, the  new world of books. Poetry, fiction, history, science, were all taken up with a  fierce rapture. Science most of all enchanted him. He threw himself with ardour  into the study of scientific progress, of the secrets the universe had yielded  up while he sat aloof, as if in Barbarossa&rsquo;s cavern, and knew not the march of  time. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>He surprised his mother one day by some  casual speech that showed he knew exactly how long he had stayed in the house  of bondage. He told her afterwards that he had found her last letter in one of  his coats that had been sent from Oxford. The pockets of all his clothes had  been emptied, but this letter had slipped under a slit in the lining of a  morning coat. When memory revived, the date of this letter, which had been kept  in his desk, gave him the date of his captivity. </p>
<p>Seven years. He had been seven years  without sense or knowledge. </p>
<p>He was now seven-and-twenty, in appearance  younger than his age; for in that long sleep of the mind the lines that thought  writes even on young faces had made no mark upon him. He had an almost boyish  air and outlook, frank, joyous, alert, eager. He had all the characteristics  that make youth enchanting. He would have but to appear in order to conquer,  his mother thought, admiring and adoring him. What girl could resist such a  lover? Oh, that he might choose wisely, that his manhood might be won by beauty  and virtue, after the lad&rsquo;s fatal infatuation for worthless charms! </p>
<p>His mother trembled when she thought of  the second ordeal, a passion that might, in spite of all his gifts, prove  unfortunate. </p>
<p>The doctors advised that he should not go  to Cranford till he had spent some time among unfamiliar surroundings. It was  well also, if there were anything in his manner, any slight deviation from  common ways, which might hint at the secret of his long seclusion, that there  should be time for the strangeness to wear off before he went among his own  people. </p>
<p>His mother told him the story she had  invented to account for his disappearance. </p>
<p>He laughed, and praised her for her  tactfulness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friends may question you, perhaps,&rdquo;  she said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;About my travels? Let them interrogate to  their hearts&rsquo; content. I will not leave a square mile of Central Africa  unexplored. From the Congo to Zanzibar there shall not be an acre that I can&rsquo;t  talk about. I will familiarise myself with every squall that ruffles the  Tanganyika, with every treacherous current on the Nyanza. There are books and  maps enough to give me every light and shadow over every mile of African  travel. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t quail before the keenest explorer I may run against. All I  want is to know where I am supposed to have been.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This was after he had been at liberty for  half a year, and when he and his mother were going back to England, and to  Hertford Street. </p>
<p>They had spent the winter and early spring  at a delicious villa among hills covered with olive woods, between Spezia and  Lerici. </p>
<p>They had been alone together, with only a  Christmas visit from the young doctor, Conrad&rsquo;s friend at Roehampton. Daisy  Meredith had been given a long holiday with her own people, whom Lady Mary paid  handsomely for the entertainment of their daughter, a detail that was  scrupulously hidden from Daisy herself, who wondered at a certain deference to  her tastes and wishes hitherto unknown in the home-circle. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>It was not till the blackthorns were in  blossom in Cranford Park that Conrad went back to the house where he was born,  the home that he had left, full of buoyant life, seven years before&mdash;going back  to Oxford in the Trinity Term; and it was in that Trinity Term, in the  freshness of the early summer, that his fate had found him. </p>
<p>Swift as the arrows of Phoebus Apollo, a  lad&rsquo;s first love had stricken him with its consuming fever. That wild  unreasoning love, the first strong impulse of the passionate heart, had exalted  a common coquette into a goddess. Dazzled by a faultless face, blind to all  that should have warned and repelled him, the impassioned boy gave up heart and  mind to his enchantress. </p>
<p>Friendly undergraduates hinted things, and  even, after youth&rsquo;s careless fashion, tried to save him; but he had taken fire  at the slightest word. </p>
<p>She was peerless, she was perfect. Earth  held no girl who could compare with her. What did her surroundings matter? He  would take her away from that vulgar world. She was fit to be an Emperor&rsquo;s  wife; and it would be sweet humility in her to accept him who had nothing to  offer but his money. </p>
<p>Thus and thus had he argued in that  romantic dream which had enthralled him&mdash;a dream of a brief summer term and a  summer vacation which seemed an eternity of joy and pain, blotting out every  memory of the years that had gone before. He thought he had not lived till he  met her. </p>
<p>In those placid restful days among the  Italian hills, the book of memory had opened itself, and Conrad had spent many  an hour wandering alone, and dreaming over the passionate story that had cost  him nearly eight years of his life. That was the price of an unreasoning love.  Eight years, perhaps the best years, of a young man&rsquo;s life. The miracle was  that he had not killed himself in his despairing rage, when he found how  worthless a creature he had worshipped. It might be that only madness&mdash; the  sudden extinction of thought and memory&mdash;had saved him from suicide. </p>
<p>He looked back, and went step by step  through the old dream, with a calm mind. The love was dead as Babylon or  Nineveh&mdash;a heap of ashes&mdash;a monument of folly, to meditate upon with  self-contempt. In the earlier days of his recovery the girl&rsquo;s face came back to  him out of the clouds. Her beauty shone like a star. Then little by little, as  memory strengthened, he lived again through every detail and circumstance of  his love story, and following that story, stage by stage, he saw what an abject  fool passion had made of him. He remembered moments of jealous doubt, sudden  suspicions lulled to rest by a smile, hard questions answered with a caress. He  recalled his aching sense of the chaperon&rsquo;s vulgarity, his torture of jealousy  when he saw other admirers favoured, other undergraduates, young and  attractive. He remembered the figure of the pugilist, loafing in the Inn  garden, or drinking in the bar, or rowing, or playing cricket; a cheap Alcides,  with a certain picturesque beauty of strength and graceful movement; and he  remembered that never for one instant had he thought of this man as a possible  rival. </p>
<p>The folly, the commonness of it all,  sickened him. He did not even want to know what had become of her, the goddess  of a single summer </p>
<p>He wanted <em>not</em> to know,  never to hear her name again; never to see anyone or anything that could remind  him of her. Happily there was no question of his going back to Oxford to work  for his degree. His trustees had kept his name upon the College books; but his  mother would not even speak of the place. </p>
<p>People at Cranford, neighbours, servants,  hangers-on, were delighted at his reappearance among them. He was so handsome,  and looked so young. Whatever dark suspicions had been harboured by friends or  dependents, as the years went by and he was still absent, were made nought by  his return. No trace of past suffering shadowed the glory of his manhood. He  was the ideal youth, taking pleasure in all the things that youth ought to  love. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Daisy beheld him with wonder when she came  back to Cranford. She had seen him in Hertford Street, in that agonising  interval before his banishment to Roehampton. She had seen him a wreck. </p>
<p>She alone was in the secret of his lost  years; for even the servants had been taught to believe that his disordered  brain was a passing trouble, the natural symptom of a fever, and that he had  recovered, and had gone to Africa with a friend. Only Daisy knew the truth; and  Daisy&rsquo;s kind heart overflowed with gladness at finding him completely restored.  She was glad for his mother&rsquo;s sake. Indeed, it was impossible not to rejoice in  Lady Mary&rsquo;s joy, joy that made her step light as a girl&rsquo;s, her laughter gay as  a child&rsquo;s, her hands eager to scatter benefits on the poor and needy. </p>
<p>They spent more than a month at Cranford  before going to London for the season; and Lady Mary entertained all her rural  neighbours, the people who had been mystified by her son&rsquo;s absence, who had  speculated about him, and had lamented over him and pitied his mother, at many  a rural tea-table, and who, beholding her young Absolom in his strength and  beauty, felt that they had wasted their pity. </p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, I suppose he was only roaming  about the world,&rdquo; said the squire&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;Young men nowadays have such a rage  for exploring.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He had better have stayed at home and  taken the hounds,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;It would have been more to his credit than  globe-trotting.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll allow that travelling opens  the mind,&rdquo; urged a spinster aunt. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Juliana. Do you  suppose a young man can learn anything from Kaffirs or South Sea Islanders?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But the great book of Nature&mdash;to see that  unfolded!&rdquo; sighed Juliana. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he see enough of Nature in a day  with the hounds? Do you think there&rsquo;s more education in an African swamp than  in a field of turnips, or a forty-acre pasture? I have no patience with the  rage for wasting English money on ox-waggons and black porters, while English  farmers have to give up breeding hunters, because they can&rsquo;t sell &rsquo;em.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>The hunting was all over before Conrad and  his mother came home; but he rode every day, exploring every bit of country  within riding distance of Cranford. He insisted on teaching Daisy to ride, she  having come back somewhat pallid and wan from the arid wilderness of North  London, and the domestic bickerings. </p>
<p>Why had she not ridden in all these years,  with a stud of hunters eating their heads off? </p>
<p>Lady Mary blushed at the question, which  struck her as a reproach. She had thought a governess-cart and a sturdy pony  good enough for Daisy, a cart in which to drive herself about among the  scattered homesteads and cottages, carrying charitable gifts, or kindly  messages, visiting the sick, and making herself beloved by young and old, since  she was not of the strong-minded order. Even when she saw things that were  amiss her word of reproof in due season was as mild as other people&rsquo;s  blessings. </p>
<p>And now Lady Mary felt that a young woman  of Daisy&rsquo;s fine health and figure ought to have been allowed to take some more  pleasure out of the horses than feeding them with sugar or apples on a morning  visit to the stables. </p>
<p>The horses had been there&mdash;growing stale  and elderly &mdash;for eight years, and no one but the corn-dealer and the grooms had  profited by their existence. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that she would care about  riding!&rdquo; said Lady Mary. &ldquo;She was such a thorough cockney before she came to  me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She would adore it. I asked her yesterday  when she was petting Mayflower&mdash;the old mare, don&rsquo;t you know, clever as a cat,  and quiet as a sheep. She flushed up like a child. You get her a habit, and  Mayflower and I will soon teach her to ride.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The habit was procured from a Southampton  tailor in less than a week, while Mayflower was being broken to the  side-saddle; and Daisy was soon scouring the country by her cousin&rsquo;s side. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You women have all got light hands,&rdquo;  Conrad said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only to learn how to use &rsquo;em. And you sit your horse  uncommonly well for a beginner.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve a neat figure, and a wild rose  complexion that doesn&rsquo;t turn scarlet after a gallop,&rdquo; he continued within  himself. </p>
<p>He did not want to flatter the young lady.  She was a kind of cousin, and he treated her in a brotherly way that was charming.  He carried her off for a ride nearly every morning, forgetting that she was  his mother&rsquo;s companion, and ought to be winding silks for the landscape on the  embroidery frame, the mill-stream and poplars that Lady Mary had been engaged  upon in her cabin when she talked to Jane Brown. He found a second horse for  her, and he showed himself so wise in his selection that no harm ever came to  her from either mount. He made her play croquet with him, and here she was the  adept, and could give him bisques, for which humiliation he revenged himself in  the evening at billiards. It was a humdrum kind of existence, but just the  existence that was best for him in the opinion of the Roehampton doctors. </p>
<p>Lady Mary began to take alarm. Was he falling in  love with Daisy Meredith? Daisy, who was charming as a dependent and <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</em>, but who was  utterly inadequate for the proud position of Conrad Harling&rsquo;s wife. Except that  she was a good and pure woman, she would be almost as objectionable as the  Inn-keeper&rsquo;s daughter; for the blood of Lady Mary&rsquo;s ducal race had been  filtered through more than one plebeian family before the union of Daisy&rsquo;s  parents, and those parents were in themselves particularly objectionable, a  husband and wife who quarrelled and parted once a year, who were always  impecunious, and always trying some new device for earning money, the man in  the city, the woman in the suburbs, singing-mistress, lady-milliner&mdash;lady-cook,  beauty-doctor. There was no limit to the potentialities of discredit or even of  disgrace. Lady Mary would hardly have been surprised to read of Mrs. Meredith&rsquo;s  debut at a music-hall; for the unfortunate  woman had a fine contralto voice which Daisy had inherited. </p>
<p>She was surprised to discover the girl so  much prettier than she had ever thought her hitherto. </p>
<p>Perhaps it was the influence of youth,  Conrad&rsquo;s buoyant temper, the rides, the games, the long days in sun and wind,  that had given such lucid beauty to the large grey eyes, such a brightness of  rose and lily to the fair young face. </p>
<p>Daisy was six-and-twenty, and had talked  of herself as <em>pass&eacute;e</em>, and had so  considered herself for some time; yet every year she saw beauties reigning  triumphantly in their seventh or eighth season, growing only of more imperious  and world-renowned charms as the years went by, like peaches slowly ripening on  a southern wall, where every hour of sunshine deepens the crimson and amber of  their bloom. </p>
<p>Lady Mary began to think that Daisy was  pretty enough to be dangerous. And then she was the first English girl Conrad  had met in his new life. There lay the peril. She was certainly the prettiest  girl in that part of the world; but although Daisy as a typical young woman was  charming, Daisy&rsquo;s people made her impossible. </p>
<p>Remembering the doctor&rsquo;s grave counsel,  Lady Mary told herself that however impossible the girl might be, from her  point of view, if Conrad set his heart upon marrying her he must not be opposed  in his desire. Indeed, his mother must be thankful that his choice had fallen  on a virtuous woman. He must not be thwarted; he must not be disappointed. The  passionate heart that had suffered so cruel an agony of lad&rsquo;s love must not  suffer from the nobler love of manhood. </p>
<p>He must not be opposed; but he might be  managed. </p>
<p>Lady Mary announced her intention of going  to London directly after the Whitsuntide holidays. &ldquo;London will be at its  best,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Conrad owned frankly that he preferred the  country; but he expressed himself pleased to go wherever his mother liked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you love Mayfair better than the  most romantic spot on earth, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, smiling at her. </p>
<p>He always addressed her as &ldquo;ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; in  their lighter moods. Mother was a word for confidences and quiet talk, when  they were alone. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born there,&rdquo; Lady Mary answered,  simply. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a solecism. You ought to have  been born at one of the ducal seats. A town house wasn&rsquo;t worthy of my stately  mother. I think you must have been stately even as a child. You wore your sash  with an air, and crushed the nursery footman if he forgot to bring your bread  and milk on a salver.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>They were settled in Hertford Street early  in June, when West End London was certainly at its best, a glorified city, full  of people whose only business was pleasure, full of blossoming trees, and  brilliant flower-beds, and exquisite frocks and hats, and beautiful faces; full  of fashions that caught the eye from their novelty, just queer enough to be  called <em>chic</em>, and that would be hackneyed and stale at  Brixton before the end of the summer. </p>
<p>Lady Mary opened her house as it had never  been opened since Mr. Harling&rsquo;s death. Her hospitalities were bounded only by  the limits of time and opportunity. She gave two dinners a week, and had people  at luncheon every day; but all her little entertainments were part of one  deep-laid scheme: to bring the most eligible girls she could find into her  son&rsquo;s company, until some day the girl of girls would be found among those  eligible ones, and Conrad would marry, to the delight of his heart and the  increase of his social distinction. So much in Lady Mary&rsquo;s world depended on a  young man&rsquo;s choice of a wife, whether he should double his weight in the social  scale or halve it. To marry Daisy would be to halve it. </p>
<p>There were at least ten girls in Lady  Mary&rsquo;s visiting book who were eligible; and of these six were beauties, while  three were great heiresses, and one was the daughter of a famous politician  whose prestige and influence would assure a young man&rsquo;s success in the  parliamentary arena. </p>
<p>Lady Mary watched the effect produced by  each of these gifted ten; and although she saw her son pleased to find himself  sitting next a lovely face, or a vivacious companion, or a girl who could talk  politics with ease and discretion, she could perceive no sign of his being  seriously impressed. </p>
<p>She returned to the charge day after day,  following up a luncheon and the charm of a huge picture hat, with a dinner and  the attraction of Parian shoulders and rounded arms. And all this beauty left  Conrad cold. He talked, he danced, he even flirted mildly with Lady Mary&rsquo;s  eligibles, but he showed no preferences. A pretty girl was a pretty girl and no  more. He had no more romantic ideas about them than Peter Bell had about a  primrose by the river&rsquo;s brim. The better they waltzed or the better they could  talk the better he liked them; and his mother observed with regret that it was  the girls who had done their four or five seasons whose society Conrad most  affected. Their vivacity and keen criticism of life amused and interested him. </p>
<p>Everything interested him. It was a mind  new born. </p>
<p>The life of the mind was new. Science,  literature, art, music, facts, fancies, superstitions, follies, all things were  new. At eight-and-twenty years of age he was still in the flower of his youth,  strong as a lion; and he had the freshness of a lad of twenty just escaped from  a public school. </p>
<p>In the country his horses and dogs had  been enough for amusement: in London the novel pleasure of rushing through the  air on the last and finest development of the motor science took his fancy, and  he had not been in Hertford Street ten days before he had established his  garage and become owner of a Panhard and a Mercedes. </p>
<p>He spent his money with a royal  magnificence; and, on finding that his mother&rsquo;s income could not afford more  than occasional stalls at the opera, he hurried off to Bond Street, and wrote a  cheque for a box on the grand tier. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ma&rsquo;am, you need have no more trouble  about your seats on the Wagner nights,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will be as much at home  at Covent Garden as in your own drawing-room&mdash; and I shall drop in every night&mdash;when  it isn&rsquo;t Wagner.&rdquo; </p>
<p>His love of  music was not the educated love. The old operas pleased him best, the operas  with stories that he could understand, and melodies that haunted him: <em>Lucrezia  Borgia, Rigoletto, Traviata,  Faust</em>, and his first favourite, <em>Don  Giovanni</em>. </p>
<p>He had the gaiety of heart which charms.  Invitations poured in upon him; manoeuvring mothers courted him. He was  handsome, he was rich, and of unblemished character, since his mother&rsquo;s intense  pride in him was a warranty for his good conduct during those years of travel. </p>
<p>He had not spent too much money; he had  not been troublesome; he was quite the most popular young man of his season. </p>
<p>Lady Mary rejoiced in his gladness with a swelling  heart, rejoiced with wonder. She had feared that the shadow of those blank  years, the memory, however dim, of that long captivity, would never leave him,  that through all his after life the thought of what he had been would be a  recurring pain, and that he would never be quite as other men of his age. </p>
<p>And now she knew that he was superior to  other men: that the long slumber of his faculties had made him a stronger man  on his awakening. It did not even pain him to speak of the past, or of things  that touched upon the past. He showed his mother a photograph of Stella Meadows  in an evening frock, with a liberal display of shoulders and arms. A girl who  has no opportunities of wearing evening dress likes to be photographed in it. </p>
<p>Lady Mary owned that the girl was  beautiful, absolutely refined in feature and expression. It was difficult to  think of her as a rustic Innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter, still more difficult to think of  her as the mistress of a pugilist. But at Oxford Lady Mary had heard something  about the girl&rsquo;s mother, and a scandal attaching to the girl&rsquo;s birth, which  suggested a more aristocratic origin, a patrician lover, a deceived husband. </p>
<p>While she looked at the photograph Lady  Mary had a vague memory of another face of the same delicate type, though not  actually resembling this face. She tried to remember when and where she had  seen it, and worried her brain for half a day in the effort to remember, when  suddenly, as she sat in her victoria, stopping by the Park rails to talk to her  friends, the scene in her cabin on the <em>Electra</em> came back  to her, and the face of Jane Brown. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the face of a pure woman,&rdquo;  thought Lady Mary, wondering at this resemblance of character and expression  rather than form, the vague something which made one face suggest the other. </p>
<p>Jane Brown had not written, as she had  asked her, to say that things had gone well with her. Lady Mary had almost  counted on such a letter, as a natural expression of gratitude for kindness  experienced in a day of misery. But it might be that things had not gone well.  The wretched girl might not have survived her hour of trial, might not have  lived to clasp a child to her heart, and to devote herself to a life of  atonement and self-sacrifice, as Mary Harling, who took a severe view of the  situation, had hoped she might. In her motherly kindness she had imagined a  future of grey peace, perhaps with a husband, some humble-minded Christian,  willing to take a penitent to his heart, and cherish her, with a sober  affection, as a brand saved from the burning. </p>
<p>But no word had come, and Lady Mary  inclined to think that Jane Brown was lying in the last long sleep in some  neglected churchyard in a lonely parish, hidden away in the south of Ireland,  where the long roll of the Atlantic breakers would lament over the short  sin-stained life. </p>
<p>Lady Mary had little time to think of Jane  Brown in this joyous midsummer, with her son&rsquo;s animated presence bursting in  upon her matronly occupations at all hours of the day. He adored his mother,  and was never in the house long without giving her a taste of his company, over  and above the social hours of eating and drinking together, those cheerful  gatherings in a handsome dining-room which must surely be regretted, as a  memory of something that was pleasant, when the chemists of the future have  found out a way of sustaining healthy and vigorous life on tabloids. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Conrad&rsquo;s high spirits were a continual  feast, and a continual surprise to his mother. From the hour when he heard her  manner of accounting for his absence he had treated his African travels as a  stupendous joke. That his mother, the severely truthful, could lie for him, was  to his mind an astounding instance of maternal love, and to him the African  fable was an inexhaustible source of amusement. </p>
<p>So far from shirking any allusion to his  travels he led people on to question him; and he was never tired of reciting  his adventures in that wonder-world. He had collected every book of travels  that had appeared since Livingstone first kindled the British mind with  enthusiasm for African adventure. He had read himself into Africa, and there  was no detail of the life&mdash;no thrilling moment of discovery, no vivid impression  of the picturesque in land or water, mountain or forest, no colour of earth or  sky, that he had not absorbed and made part and parcel of his own mind. With  Stanley, with Cameron, with Burton, with Trivier, he had wandered and wondered.  He plagiarised freely, but from so wide a variety of writers that he was not  afraid of being found out&mdash;not even when almost in Cameron&rsquo;s very words he  thrilled a luncheon party by his impressions at first sight of the Tanganyika,  or when with Stanley he plunged into the blue waters of the Zambesi for his  morning bath, and found himself tumbling about among a herd of hippopotami.  Adventures with native kings, adventures in dug-out canoes on tempest-tossed  lakes, adventures with elephants, lions, antelopes&mdash;hair-breadth escapes of  every kind&mdash;he had them all at the service of his friends, and was admired as  the most vivid of colourists, the most graphic of narrators. </p>
<p>His mother and Daisy Meredith heard, and  marvelled, and sometimes ventured a grave reproof, which he laughed away. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The initial lie having been told there  can be no harm in expatiating upon it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And remember, Daisy, all my  adventures are true, absolutely and matter-of-factly true, although they didn&rsquo;t  happen to me. But I shall have to make them really true some day, for I think I  have caught the African fever; and then your conscience will be lightened of a  burden, and you and my mother can sleep easy in your beds.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary exclaimed and remonstrated.  Could she ever know a night&rsquo;s rest if he were a traveller on that Dark  Continent where when two go together only one returns? </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6 </strong></h2>
<p>Daisy&rsquo;s life  narrowed to strictly domestic limits in Hertford Street. She had left her habit  at Cranford with the hunters and shooting dogs, the mallets and billiard balls,  all things belonging to the life that she and Conrad had led together, in  frankest friendship, almost as brother and sister. He had brought a couple of  hacks to London, and he rode in the Row before breakfast; but Lady Mary had set  her face rigidly against Park riding for Daisy Meredith. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I let you have your own way about her in  Hampshire,&rdquo; she told her son, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want you to go on spoiling her now  we are in London, where I really can&rsquo;t do without her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Conrad gave way without a struggle; and  his mother assured herself that he was not in love. A lover would not have been  so reasonable. He told Daisy that she should ride to hounds in October; and  whenever there were ladies on his motor she was one of the party. </p>
<p>There was no desertion of his rural  comrade. Conrad was always kind after his fraternal fashion; but he was tremendously  in request, and had very little time to spare. He went to dances that Daisy did  not hear of, choice balls in great houses, where from five-and-twenty to fifty  of the <em>fine fleur</em> of young manhood were entertained at a  sumptuous dinner in order that they might condescend to dance. </p>
<p>Daisy thought herself lucky if she went to  three balls in a season, chaperoned by one of Lady Mary&rsquo;s good-natured friends.  She used to awake in the warm summer night, hearing carriage wheels rolling up  and down the narrow street, and picturing to herself the brilliant scene in  Park Lane, or Stanhope Street, or Berkeley Square, or Grosvenor, or Belgravia,  and picturing Conrad Harling as the grandest, handsomest, most utterly  delightful young man there. </p>
<p>It was after one of the biggest balls of  the year, when the summer and the season were at the zenith, that Conrad  expressed himself more enthusiastically than usual. It was the finest ball he  had ever seen. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the flowers were something  wonderful,&rdquo; suggested Daisy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy-land. A week&rsquo;s food for an East End  parish squandered on lilies and roses. Walls of roses, pyramids of lilies;  words cannot paint the splendour.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And the supper?&rdquo; inquired Lady Mary. </p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gunter cum Gargantua</em>, an endless  web of peaches and asparagus and ortolans and quails, young turkeys stuffed  with truffles, hams stewed in champagne, everything expensive that a greedy man  could imagine. I took a turn in the Green Park when I came away, and saw the  tramps lying asleep in the pale green light, with open mouths, and faces the  colour of death.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary sighed, and Daisy sighed. To  them as to Conrad the contrast was dreadful. Everybody feels the same sharp  pang, and forgets all about it three minutes afterwards. </p>
<p>&ldquo;And the people?&rdquo; inquired Daisy. &ldquo;Were  all the pretty people there?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;All, married and single&mdash;and one over.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The new beauty. It seems I ought to have  heard of her, though she only came to London a week ago, after all the  drawing-rooms were over. She was supposed to have been presented in Dublin last  winter, a Dowager told me. As if it mattered when, where, ever, or never? She  looks as if she had dropped from a star, too ethereal for earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you dance with her?&rdquo; Daisy asked,  with a throb of heart-pain. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Two waltzes. She waltzes divinely. I felt  like a cyclops embracing a sylph.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us who she is,&rdquo; said  Lady Mary, with whom the who was more essential than the what. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is quite quite, don&rsquo;t you know;  an only daughter with a young stepmother. Her father is Sir Michael Thelliston,  the General who distinguished himself by his management of that little Gold  Coast scrimmage the other day&mdash;or, at least, made people believe it of him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she an only daughter?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;An only child. The stepmother is a  gushing person, and told me all about her husband, and all about Irene. That&rsquo;s  her name, and she looks it. I want you to call upon Lady Thelliston, ma&rsquo;am, at  your earliest convenience. This afternoon, if you like.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary smiled at him across the cosy  round table. They breakfasted in the library, a room with an old-fashioned  bow-window opening into a morsel of garden, which was full of flowers that were  brought there in their beauty and taken away directly they had done blooming,  like young beauties in a Sultan&rsquo;s seraglio. </p>
<p>Lady Mary smiled, and told herself that  the spark had been found, the young heart had taken fire. This new beauty had  only to appear and to conquer, where her garden of girls had been impotent to  charm. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Thelliston much prettier than all  the other pretty girls you know?&rdquo; she asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Prettier? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know how to measure  prettiness. She is almost too exquisite to be mortal &mdash;like those marvellous  orchids that seem too beautiful to be only flowers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as Romeo talked of Juliet.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I? What would I not have given for  Juliet&rsquo;s balcony last night&mdash;to have had a long jaw with her after the ball?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll call upon Lady  Thelliston&mdash;since I suppose they are new-comers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite new; mere babes in the wood from a  society point of view. He has been fighting all his life &mdash; in  India&mdash;Egypt&mdash;Africa&mdash;always doing well&mdash;according to the wife&mdash;but never coming to  the front as he did in the West African row. Call this afternoon, ma&rsquo;am, if you  please. I should like to know what you think of the stepmother.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where they live?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a slip of a house in Chapel  Street&mdash; with a front that looks like a ladder of flower-boxes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come to know the house?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She rides every morning&mdash;in point of fact,  I rode with her this morning &mdash; I walked my horse that way&mdash;and saw her mount.  She has an Arab that her father brought from India for his wife&mdash; who had been  married before, by the way, to another soldier&mdash;and the wife doesn&rsquo;t like the  horse&mdash; in point of fact, can&rsquo;t ride. And so her stepdaughter has the reversion of  him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And she told you all this in two  waltzes,&rdquo; exclaimed Daisy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The stepmother told me. Miss Thelliston  is not loquacious.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the young lady ride alone?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No; her father rides with her, but he was  under the weather this morning, and she had only her groom. She was dancing at  three o&rsquo;clock, and in the Row before eight. She is not one of your rest-cure  girls who lie in bed reading French novels till it&rsquo;s time to dress for lunch.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there are no such girls,&rdquo; said  Lady Mary, with whom getting up early was a part of religion. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Conrad could scarcely be more eager about  his mother&rsquo;s visit to Lady Thelliston than she herself was to become acquainted  with the girl who had attracted her son. The history of Conrad&rsquo;s future life  must needs be coloured by the woman he loved and married. That he should choose  wisely, now in the flower of manhood, he who had so unwisely chosen in his  early youth, was of infinite importance. She had been told that he must not be  thwarted in a second love-affair, that to keep the balance of that fine mind,  now perfectly adjusted, there must be no new love-trouble. He had loved with an  intensity of passion rare in early youth, a concentration of purpose that  indicated unusual strength of will and unusual sensitiveness. To cross his will  now, to come between him and the desire of his heart, might be fatal. His  doctors had signified as much; and his mother thought of this sudden fancy with  a thrill of fear. </p>
<p>He had talked of the new beauty with  boyish lightness, too openly, perhaps, for real feeling; but a fancy begun so  lightly might grow into passion; and, oh, what a lifetime of joy or sorrow  might have begun among the roses and lilies of last night&rsquo;s ball! Romeo&rsquo;s  tragedy of swift, sudden love began at such a festival, among the lights and  music in the joyous crowd. </p>
<p>Mary Harling felt that her peaceful days  were over. She was on the threshold of a passionate drama, the drama of her  son&rsquo;s destiny. </p>
<p>Was the girl a lady? That is the first  question a woman of Lady Mary&rsquo;s <em>milieu</em> asks. Sir  Michael Thelliston&rsquo;s daughter was at least of decent birth, and must have been  decently brought up; but Lady Mary had met with girls of superior lineage and  expensive education who were not ladies.  Those were, of course, the exceptions that prove the rule; but what if this  girl were an abnormal specimen, and not a lady? Conrad had declared that she  was &ldquo;quite quite,&rdquo; and after all that he had suffered for the sad mistake of  his boyhood he was surely, of all men, the least likely to be captivated by the  loveliest girl in London, if she were bad style. </p>
<p>Bad style was Lady Mary&rsquo;s <em>bete noire</em>. She went  about the world with a suspicious eye, finding it in unexpected places. That  girl on the steamer, for instance, with the hideous phrase: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me  away,&rdquo; in the midst of her tragedy. She had never forgotten her shudder of  disgust even in a moment of pity. That girl was undoubtedly bad style; and all  that had happened to her in Cashmere had been more or less the result of bad  style; a chaperon with neither morals nor manners, a lover who was not a  gentleman: the kind of life Lady Mary had read about in Anglo-Indian stories. </p>
<p>Slang was interwoven with Conrad&rsquo;s speech,  but slang had to be forgiven in a man, like smoking, and sporting papers, and  motors, and bull-dogs; but a slangy phrase from a woman&rsquo;s lips was intolerable. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Lady Mary went alone to pay her visit. She  often took Daisy with her on such pioneering calls, when she had been asked to  be civil to some friend of her friends; but this was too solemn an occasion.  She wanted to be alone, to have all her senses about, her. She wanted to weigh  the girl and the stepmother in her judicial balance, which she could hardly do  if Daisy and the girl were keeping up a trivial chatter at her elbow. </p>
<p>She went early in the afternoon, wishing  to be the only visitor. </p>
<p>She looked up disapprovingly at the tall  narrow house, the ladder of flower-boxes, scenting bad style in that flamboyant  facade. There were too many flowers, and the effect was garish. Yet Lady Mary  liked colour, and would have admired the joyous dazzle of tropelium and  lobelia, pink geranium and sulphur marguerites, on any other facade. She went  into the house with a sinking heart. It had come too soon, the manhood&rsquo;s love  which she feared, the love that must be satisfied. </p>
<p>In the narrow entrance hall, and on the  narrower staircase, everything was gay and pretty: the white woodwork, the  white wall-paper, over which gigantic pink roses clustered and clambered, the  moss-green velvet pile that covered every inch of the stairs and landing. In  the drawing-room where the visitor found herself alone, there was the same gay  colour. It was the house of a <em>petite maitresse</em>, a house like  a <em>bonbonniere</em>, and it seemed almost too diminutive to be  a real house after the spaciousness of the old family mansion in Hertford  Street, where all Lady Mary&rsquo;s audacities in the way of colour had failed to  give an air of gaiety. This box of a house on the sunny side of the street  sparkled and glowed like a bed of summer roses. </p>
<p>The stepmother appeared before the  visitor&rsquo;s eager eyes had time to disentangle the elements of prettiness, china,  water-colours, miniatures, bonbon-boxes, hot-house flowers, scent-bottles,  fans. </p>
<p>&ldquo;How more than sweet of you to come so  soon,&rdquo; Lady Thelliston exclaimed, with outstretched welcoming hand. &ldquo;Mr.  Harling told us he would ask you to call&mdash;but we thought even if you were so  good as to come, it might be ages first.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to know all my son&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo;  Lady Mary said, in a quiet voice. &ldquo;He&mdash;he so much enjoyed his dance with Miss  Thelliston. He says she waltzes divinely.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Even in saying these few words she had  time to discover that the stepmother had been remarkably handsome, and that her  complexion came out of bottles. As a work of art she was faultless: hair,  figure, hands, eyebrows; but Mary Harling shivered at the thought of her as  Conrad&rsquo;s mother-in-law. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she wonderful? Buried alive in an  out-of-the-way corner of the South of Ireland ever since she began to grow up,  and yet the most delicious dancer, and more accomplished in every way than one  girl in a hundred.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Sir Michael Thelliston an Irishman?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Intensely Irish, though I&rsquo;m happy to say  a long life in India has only left him a suspicion of their dreadful accent.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Thelliston was educated at home&mdash;  in her father&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; questioned Lady Mary, wanting to find out everything  about these people, but painfully reminded of previous visits in strange  drawing-rooms to inquire about the character of an upper servant. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor Michael has no Irish home; he sold  every acre ages ago, when he saw things were going from bad to worse. Our sweet  Irene has been vegetating under the care of a spinster aunt&mdash;Roman Catholic&mdash;and  a bigot at that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary was dumb. She had been seized  with an inward trembling, which made her look forlornly at the nearest gold and  crystal scent bottle, wondering whether it held eau-de-cologne, or any other  reviving essence. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not her father&rsquo;s fault that she  was not having a good time in India. The climate was her only enemy. He sent her  to Cashmere, but even that divine climate didn&rsquo;t suit her&mdash;so there was nothing  to be done but send her home. It was before our marriage, and the poor man had  no one to advise or help him. And then came the West Coast war, and his  regiment left India, a month after our wedding day. Hard lines for me, wasn&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo; Lady Mary murmured something, with dry lips; and Lady Thelliston, always  charmed to talk of herself, went on blandly: </p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was all for the best&mdash;and the  little African war did more for Michael than Burma or Waziristan, and he got  his K.C.B. just in time, after a long, hard-working career, and very few  chances. I came home to find a house, and furnish it, and get everything ready  for my dear old man; and the first thing I made him do for me when he came from  Africa was to take me to Ireland to see my new daughter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Again a murmur from dry lips, a despairing  look in a face that seemed frozen. Lady Thelliston, admiring her own coiffure  in a narrow panel of looking-glass, meandered on complacently: </p>
<p>&ldquo;What a revelation! I expected a clumsy,  overgrown, potato-fed girl, with a thick brogue, and no manners; and I found a  gem of the first water: a girl pretty enough to make what people call &lsquo;the  match of the season.&rsquo; I thought of Tom Moore&rsquo;s lovely song, &lsquo;Full many a gem of  purest ray,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you know, and I insisted on bringing her to London with us.  She has only been here three weeks, and she can hardly walk in the Park in  peace. People stare atrociously, and I saw women standing on chairs to look at  her last Sunday &mdash;the women who come on <em>char-a-bancs</em> from  Brixton. <em>Enfin</em>, my stepdaughter is talked about  everywhere as the new beauty.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she pleased with her success?&rdquo; Lady  Mary asked, finding a voice at last, a voice that sounded not her own. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If she is she doesn&rsquo;t show it. She&rsquo;s  rather a curious girl. If she were not so lovely I should call her  strong-minded,&rdquo; added Lady Thelliston, as if the union of mind and beauty were  impossible. </p>
<p>The door was opened quietly, and the new  beauty appeared, tall and slender, with loosely-coiled hair that held the  sunlight, and dark eyes that were like deep waters. </p>
<p>She was the girl Mary Harling expected to  see, but glorified. The troubled countenance, the sullenness of despair, the  slovenly garments, had obscured much of that delicate beauty, and there had  been the indefinable suggestion of a lost woman that had shocked and pained  even a heart inclined to pity. </p>
<p>To-day she looked as pure as a June lily,  her simple white frock perfection, her coiffure admirable, her pose graceful  and dignified. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harling did not forget his promise,&rdquo;  said the stepmother, smiling at her. &ldquo;Lady Mary, this is my daughter, Irene,  who greatly enjoyed her dances with Mr. Harling.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so seldom one&rsquo;s partners are as  good as Mr. Harling,&rdquo; the girl said quietly, while Lady Mary looked at her in  silence. </p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s calm outlook, and steady  accents, took her breath away. That she could stand before her there, smiling,  unabashed, with the air of a young Princess accustomed to adulation, disgusted  the woman who had been kind to her in her day of shame. She did not consider  that there had been time for Irene Thelliston to prepare her mind for this  encounter, to muster all that she had of courage, or of audacity, to face the  situation. Nor did she reckon with the defiant attitude of a girl who had  lately discovered that she was eminently beautiful, and had the world at her  feet. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What an actress,&rdquo; thought Lady Mary, and  she was thankful for the loquacity of the stepmother, who expatiated upon last  night&rsquo;s ball: the pretty people who were there, the harridans and horrors who  ought not to have been there, the ortolans and peaches, the scraggy shoulders  and painted faces, the band, the rose-wreathed staircase and the royal guests. </p>
<p>She gave a cover to Lady Mary&rsquo;s silence  and enabled her to make her escape, with a somewhat hasty adieu. </p>
<p>While Lady Thelliston rang the bell, the  girl followed the visitor to the landing, as if by an instinct of politeness;  but directly they were outside the mask dropped, and something of the old  trouble came into the dark eyes, and trembled on the lips. </p>
<p>But the girl spoke no word. She only  looked at Lady Mary very earnestly, and made the sign of the cross, an instant  before the butler appeared to conduct the guest to the door, where the  unexceptionable footman and the unexceptionable Victoria waited. The visit had  not lasted a quarter of an hour, but Mary Harling went out into the sunshine  dazed, her mind paralysed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; she told the servant, as she sank  into her seat, and footman and coachman wondered. </p>
<p>Home was all she wanted. She was not equal  even to driving round the Park. She wanted to shut herself in her own room; her  bedroom, where nobody but her maid would come; and to think out the situation. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He must not marry her, he must not marry  her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The words repeated themselves in her  brain, like the strokes of a hammer. And then came that other thought. He must  not be thwarted. </p>
<p>There was the horror of it. </p>
<p>And then there was her oath, the only vow  that she had ever made upon that sacred symbol. In her well-ordered life there  had been no need of oaths, no secrets to keep, until her son&rsquo;s breakdown  obliged silence. She remembered how the girl had pushed the crucifix into her  reluctant hand, and how her lips had rested on the sacred form. Could that  distracted girl, bowed to the dust by her disgrace, ashamed, and angry with the  fate that had put shame upon her, could that crouching figure, those eyes  hiding from the light, be one and the same as the dazzling vision of to-day, so  pure-looking and ethereal? </p>
<p>The oath bound her. She could give her son  no word of warning, for what manner of warning would serve if it were less than  a revelation of the girl&rsquo;s history? What other obstacle could be put in the way  of ardent love? Unless she could tell him that the girl he admired was a fallen  creature she could not hope to influence him. She could only hope what most  people hope in the face of a threatened misfortune, that the danger would blow  over. This sudden fervour, this impetuous fancy for a lovely face, might pass  and leave no permanent impression. Was it not </p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;too rash, too  unadvised, too sudden,<br>
  Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br>
Ere one can say it lightens?&rdquo; </p>
<p>She tried to believe that her son&rsquo;s ardour  indicated a caprice and not a passion. But if it were otherwise&mdash;if he were to  fall seriously in love with Irene Thelliston, well&mdash;she had weapons, even if  tied on one hand by her oath, and on the other by her dread of opposing her  son&rsquo;s will. She would fight for her beloved. It should be war to the death  between her and this audacious girl, who could presume to greet her with a  placid smile, pure and innocent-looking as Mary when she listened to the Divine  Messenger. </p>
<p>She wondered if in every crowded ballroom,  in every throng of girlish faces, there were secrets as foul as this. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I must fight for my son,&rdquo; she said to  herself, and then began to meditate upon the weapons she could use. </p>
<p>Could she carry him to the other end of  the world with her, pretend an ardent desire to visit the Antipodes, and  persuade him to take her there? He was so kind, so indulgent to all her wishes,  that if he were fancy-free it would be the easiest thing to make him forego all  the pleasures of an English winter, the hunting and shooting that his soul  longed for, and take upon himself the toil and burden of a journey round the  world, to do her pleasure. But if he were no longer fancy-free, if his heart  were touched, to propose such an exile would be to ensure a refusal. He would  see through the manoeuvre, and resent the attempt to part him from his  enchantress. </p>
<p>No! It was to the enchantress herself she  must appeal: even if she had to sue in <em>forma  pauperis</em>, urging the inferiority of such a marriage for the new  beauty. The girl who was expected to make the great match of the season could  very well afford to refuse a commoner with thirty thousand a year. </p>
<p>She would appeal to Miss Thelliston&rsquo;s  vanity, to her ambition, to her greed of wealth; or remembering her impressions  on board the <em>Electra</em>, and  believing that there was some good in the creature whose remorse for sin had  been so keen an agony, she would take a higher ground as a mother pleading for  her son. She would appeal to the girl&rsquo;s better feelings. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all the world before you to  choose,&rdquo; she might say. &ldquo;Let this man go. What can it matter to you?&rdquo; </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</strong></h2>
<p>Having resolved  upon the thing that she must do Lady Mary was able to compose her spirits, and  to appear in the drawing-room at a quarter-past eight, with the usual placid  and reposeful air. She dined at half-past eight in summer, so as to allow Conrad  one more half-hour of sunshine and open air&mdash;or perhaps a rubber in the  card-room at Arthur&rsquo;s. Daisy was always dressed early, and she liked to amuse  herself at the piano till Lady Mary came down. It was her idle half-hour after  the last letter had been written, Daisy&rsquo;s chief duties lying in the epistolary  line. </p>
<p>There was daylight still at half-past  eight, and only the reading-lamps on the tables had been lighted, amber-shaded  lamps that made for prettiness in the large, lofty rooms with their gilded Louis  Seize furniture, and turquoise blue hangings. </p>
<p>There were some fine pictures of the  decorative order, a Leighton, a Poynter, a Frank Dicksee, two classical  subjects by Albert Moore, a dog and a girl by Briton Riviere, and an Alma  Tadema that sparkled like a gem: pictures chosen years before, when Mr. Harling  refurnished his father&rsquo;s house for his young wife. The room had a large  splendour utterly unlike the <em>petite maitresse</em> air that  Lady Mary had objected to in the Chapel Street drawing-room. There were books  on all the tables, and there was Lady Mary&rsquo;s embroidery frame under a silken  cover&mdash;but the costly frivolities that crowd modern tables and make them useless  as tables were not there. The only ornaments were a few pieces of S&egrave;vres in a  pair of old French buhl and ormolu cabinets. </p>
<p>If punctuality is the politeness of  Princes it is also the homage of sons, and Conrad&rsquo;s usual way was to be in the  drawing-room at least ten minutes before dinner was announced. It was the  moment in which he told his mother the news of the day: who was alive and who  was dead among illustrious invalids; who was in and who was out in the  bye-election; what horse had won, or which side was beaten at Lord&rsquo;s. Although  these latter results neither troubled nor excited her, she liked to hear of  them from him, and would even affect an interest in racing and cricket. </p>
<p>This evening he only appeared two minutes  before the butler, bright-eyed and flushed, fastening the last button of his  waistcoat as he came into the room. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you in the Park this evening,  ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he asked gaily. &ldquo;I looked for your Victoria in the usual spot, and ever  so many people asked me why you weren&rsquo;t there. The finest afternoon this  summer!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to Windsor on  your motor, as you arranged with Captain Selkirk on Wednesday.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I let Selkirk go alone, with his wife.  They were only married in February, and they would rather have a long <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> than my  company.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And were you all the afternoon in the  Park?&rdquo; Daisy asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was there in the golden hour when the  river of life is at the flood&mdash;when the Bobbies are clearing the road for the  Queen, and when there&rsquo;s not a chair to be had for love or money.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He gave her his arm, and they went  downstairs, Lady Mary following in a stately solitude. Even in that one flight  of stairs she had time to ask herself why she had ever been so demented as to  object to Daisy as a wife for her son, why she had not encouraged his liking  for the poor cousin, and done all in her power to keep him in the country, where  Daisy was a bright particular star among the rather plain daughters of the  Squires and Squireens, and of the one great nobleman, whose four over-grown  girls nobody had been induced to bid for. </p>
<p>How well adapted they were for each other;  Daisy just tall enough for good style, her neat shining head a little above  Conrad&rsquo;s shoulder, not insolently over-topping him. </p>
<p>Everything about Daisy was satisfactory,  her manners, her clothes, the songs she sang, her way of thinking&mdash;everything.  Indeed, it was only natural that Lady Mary should approve of a girl who was the  work of her own hands. All the refinements of Daisy&rsquo;s education, all the things  that had formed her taste and improved her mind &mdash;travel, books, nice people&mdash;had  come to her from Lady Mary. She had gone to Hertford Street a raw girl&mdash;with one  shabby box, and a flavour of Bohemia in her manner, and she was now, in Mary  Harling&rsquo;s opinion, a perfect specimen of gentle blood and gentle rearing. She  was good style. Lady Mary had done for her what Nature did for Wordsworth&rsquo;s  Lucy. She had made her a lady of her own. </p>
<p>And Conrad had been in a fair way to love  this girl; he had been perhaps on the threshold of a <em>grande  passion</em> for Daisy Meredith, when his mother nipped the delicate flower in  the bud, and brought him to London, to fall into the toils of Jane Brown. </p>
<p>There was less talk than usual at dinner.  Daisy was thoughtful even to sadness. Conrad played the agreeable rattle while  the fish was being eaten, and fell into preoccupied silence during the rest of  the meal; but not till he had questioned his mother anxiously about her health. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  understand your staying at home in such delicious weather, ma&rsquo;am, unless you  were feeling not quite up to the mark&mdash;a chill&mdash;a headache &mdash;or something.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was quite well. But one may tire  even of the Park.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather like a superior kind of  treadmill&mdash; compared with a rush on a motor,&rdquo; said Daisy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Daisy, you shall have a motor  rush before long. We&rsquo;ll make up a cosy little party and go to Henley to tea.  The Selkirks, and you, and perhaps Sir Michael and Miss Thelliston. And my  mother might run down by rail and meet us. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be rather jolly?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Daisy in a voice of inexpressible sadness  replied that it would be too delightful for words. </p>
<p>The butler handed wines, of which one  glass was taken by Conrad, and fruit, which nobody would look at. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they&rsquo;d never go!&rdquo; said Conrad  when the second pair of black silk stockings had vanished behind the  noiselessly closed door, then turning to his mother eagerly: &ldquo;Well, you saw  them both, ma&rsquo;am. You went early, like a brick, and found them at home. Come  now, what do you think of them? How about first impressions?&rdquo; </p>
<p>His manner was gay, but Daisy could see  that he was nervous, apprehensive of he knew not what, eager, impatient. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Lady Thelliston is a very  meretricious person.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Patronises the beauty-doctors,  supplements nature with art? Well, she must have been remarkably handsome <em>dans le  temps</em>, so there&rsquo;s some excuse.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no excuse for a lady rouging her  cheeks like a person in the Burlington Arcade.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This for Lady Mary was equivalent to a  torrent of bad language from another woman. </p>
<p>Conrad looked surprised, and then laughed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear mother, how old-fashioned you  are! Rouging her cheeks! As if modern art stopped at such primitive measures.  Do you think when middle-age comes upon an attractive woman she has only to buy  herself a pot of rouge and a hare&rsquo;s-foot. She must have beauty-specialists,  massage, electricity, and give her complexion at least two hours a day of  serious toil. It&rsquo;s a mercy if she doesn&rsquo;t resort to surgery and have her face  flayed and get herself a new complexion. At least that&rsquo;s what my partners tell  me about their aunts. But let us pass Lady Thelliston, and tell me what you  think of her stepdaughter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her only for a few minutes. She is  very handsome, I have no doubt.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak with such an uncertain tone.  But your own eyes beheld her. You must have seen that she is lovely. Did you  ask them to lunch, or to dinner? They go out a great deal: but I hope they  could give you a day.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;A verbal invitation, in a ten-minutes&rsquo;  call! My dear Conrad, that&rsquo;s hardly my way of inviting people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not seem to have been very  effusive.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I did what you wished me to do.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You called upon them&mdash;like the Vicar&rsquo;s  wife on a new parishioner. But I want you to make them your friends&mdash;to bring  them here. I want Daisy to be kind to Irene, who is a stranger in London.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be long a stranger, if  everybody is raving about her like you,&rdquo; said Daisy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When can you ask them to dinner, mother?  Get them to name an early date. It can fit in with one of your innumerable  dinners. The season is half over, so there is no time to lose.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Sir Michael Thelliston?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. He doesn&rsquo;t show up at dances. I  shall meet him in the Row to-morrow morning. He&rsquo;s all right&mdash;a hero&mdash;a diplomat,  a K.C.B. Write one of your little dainty notes to-night, ma&rsquo;am, so that Lady  Thelliston may get it at breakfast to-morrow.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was no help for Lady Mary. Conrad  fidgeted about the drawing-room till he had her seated at her Davenport,  writing the invitation. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am giving her a choice of two days next  week, and three days the week after.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am. I think she&rsquo;ll choose  the earliest, even if she throws over something good. She wants to have you for  a friend.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can have an idea in  common,&rdquo; said Lady Mary. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you can tell her about people,  teach her how to steer her bark. A new-comer, an Anglo-Indian&mdash;what a privilege  for such an one to know Lady Mary Harling.&rdquo; </p>
<p>His tone was a caress. He hung over his  mother&rsquo;s chair, delighted at seeing the letter addressed and sealed. He rang  for the servant to get it posted. </p>
<p>&ldquo;At once, Thomas, and at the Post-Office.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to ride with them to-morrow  morning?&rdquo; asked Lady Mary. </p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, and always, till they give me  the cold shoulder. The General rides every day. It was only a chance that she  was alone this morning. She rode on the north side of the Park to avoid the  crowd.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were with her all the time?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have found it difficult to  shake me off.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He was not ashamed of his infatuation. It  was young love, eager, headstrong, determined, Romeo&rsquo;s love for Juliet, after  his heart had bled for Rosaline; a second love, ardent as the first, and  perhaps no less fatal. To love like that, suddenly, unquestioning, was to  strike the keynote of a tragedy. </p>
<p>Lady Mary was in a desperate pass. She  could not openly oppose him by refusing to be friendly with these people. She  must diplomatise, and still hope that the sudden fire would burn out quickly  like a candle in a draught, wasting itself in a profligate flame. With her son  she must diplomatise; but with the sin-stained girl who had bewitched him she  could deal plainly and speak straight words. </p>
<p>Her invitation was accepted promptly&mdash;for  one of the earlier days. With a sinking heart she made up her party. A literary  man and a soldier, the soldier young and attractive, would make the seventh and  eighth of a friendly little dinner. </p>
<p>Conrad was glad that they would be so few;  and his mother hoped that her nephew, who was in the Scots Greys and a general  favourite, might prove a counter attraction for Miss Thelliston, and perhaps  develop that young lady&rsquo;s least winning characteristics. If, for instance, she  were to show herself an incorrigible flirt, and so disgust Conrad in the dawn  of love! Lady Mary&rsquo;s policy was Machiavelian and merciless. She felt that her  cause was good, and fought without compunction. </p>
<p>The dinner was bright and gay, and Lady  Mary&rsquo;s manoeuvre was unsuccessful. Miss Thelliston&rsquo;s behaviour was perfect.  While she was amiable to both young men she was familiar with neither, and she  showed herself deeply interested in Daisy and in all womanly subjects, the  pictures on the walls, the books on the tables, books fresh from the library,  memoirs, letters, travels, philosophy, books that indicate the superior mind.  In her tour of the rooms with Daisy after dinner, she ignored only one somewhat  conspicuous object, Lady Mary&rsquo;s embroidery frame, where a solitary poplar  showed amid a desert of tissue paper. </p>
<p>Sir Michael revealed himself to Lady  Mary&rsquo;s anxious gaze as a person of sufficiently dignified aspect. He was  considerably over six feet, very thin, and very upright; a hard man, with  narrow steel-grey eyes, iron-grey hair cropped close, and a heavy moustache and  beetling brows that were almost black. Lady Mary suspected a cruel mouth under  that drooping moustache. </p>
<p>Had Miss Thelliston behaved badly, Lady  Mary might have waited, still hoping that the danger would blow over, but  seeing the girl&rsquo;s manners irreproachable she felt there was no time to be lost.  Such a love-affair was like a quicksand, and Conrad was sinking so fast that he  would soon be submerged beyond the hope of rescue. Whatever her power might be  she must use it at once. </p>
<p>She invited Irene to her sofa with a  smile, when the girl had made the round of the pictures and had said all that  could be said about them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Please sit by my side for a few minutes,  Miss Thelliston. I want to ask you something.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The delicate colour on the girl&rsquo;s cheek  faded ever so slightly, and her eyes grew grave. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope you are not going to be  serious,&rdquo; she said in a very low voice. &ldquo;Pray let bygones be bygones.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be serious. I am not going to  speak of the past, at least not more than is absolutely necessary. But I must  speak to you about the future. Will you come to see me after your ride  to-morrow morning, so that we may have half an hour&rsquo;s quiet talk together? Will  you come to breakfast at half-past nine?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t break bread with you if you  are going to talk seriously. I know what that means. I won&rsquo;t sit at table with  you and Miss Meredith and your son, and pretend to be happy, if I have <em>that</em> on my mind.  I&rsquo;ll come here at eleven o&rsquo;clock, if you like. I am my own mistress till  luncheon. Lady Thelliston requires the morning for her complexion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall expect you at eleven. Be  assured I am not going to say anything unkind.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, Lady Mary. I have had my fill  of unkindness.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She rose and went over to the piano where  Daisy was going to sing with Captain Mansfeld, who was one of those young men  who do things: singing, amateur acting, lightning portraits, tricks with  billiard balls, and a little conjuring. </p>
<p>Professor Wilmer, the man of letters,  walked to the other end of the room in disgust. In a friendly party of eight he  ought to have been the star, and a monologue from him should have been the only  entertainment; and here were an amateur tenor and contralto blocking  conversation, and spoiling his evening. </p>
<p>The little Dresden clock on the  mantelshelf in Lady Mary&rsquo;s morning-room struck eleven, with a tiny silvery  chime; the clock on the stairs solemnly repeated the information; and a church  clock, ever so far away, sent the same message through the summer air, while  Lady Mary moved about the room restlessly, nervous and apprehensive. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Would the girl keep her appointment?&rdquo; </p>
<p>She had only three minutes&rsquo; uncertainty  before the butler announced Miss Thelliston. </p>
<p>Irene was dressed simply and girlishly in  a white frock and white hat with white gloves and sunshade. A small bunch of  pink carnations at her waist-band was the only touch of colour. </p>
<p>Her clothes would have been simple enough  for a village in the heart of the country, but the general effect was  distinguished, and her morning face was exquisite, her cheeks flushed with  vivid rose, and her eyes brilliant as if with some great joy. It was not the  countenance Lady Mary expected to see. Here there was no touch of shame or of  remorse. Yet there was no defiance: only un-measurable content. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you sit here, by the window. We can  talk quite at our ease. Daisy Meredith has gone for a walk with the dogs. I  want to talk to you seriously, straight from my heart to your heart.&rdquo; </p>
<p>They were  seated side by side on a large low sofa, that filled Lady Mary&rsquo;s favourite bow  window, a window commanding a peep into Park Lane and the trees in Hamilton  Gardens. There was a silence of some moments and then Mary Harling said  gravely: </p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you know that my son admires  you, Miss Thelliston?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know as much as that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only natural that he should admire  a very beautiful girl, about whose antecedents he knows nothing; but I think  your own good feeling, your own good taste, will induce you to do all in your  power to discourage him?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,  Lady Mary?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Need you ask me why? He is my son, my  only son, dearer to me than life. Can&rsquo;t you understand that it would break my  heart if he were to marry any woman upon whose girlhood there was a stain?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t understand. Have you  forgotten your own words that last night on board the <em>Electra</em>? Some day,  you said, a good man might want me for his wife; and you urged me to tell him my wretched  story, and you told me that if he was indeed my true lover, he would forgive  me, and take me to his heart, and cherish me for the rest of my days. That is  what you told me, Lady Mary; so, now I suppose you wish me to tell your son the  story of my life in Cashmere?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I want you to act like a true and  generous woman, and to let my son go. His fancy has been caught by your beauty.  There can be no depth or seriousness in his feeling for you. All you have to do  is to let him see that you are not attracted by him, that he is nothing to you.  It must be so easy for you to give up this one admirer, since you are lovely  enough to have many suitors, men of high rank in the world, men who can give  you a position that every other woman will envy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind to promise me such  grand things, but I do not happen to care for them. Your son loves me with a  most enchanting love, and I would rather be his wife than a duchess, if there  were a duke in my horoscope.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you  must not marry him&mdash;you must not. I won&rsquo;t live to see you married to my son,&rdquo;  Lady Mary cried vehemently, losing all self-control.&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do to prevent it? Every thing  was settled this morning, and I am engaged to your son. My father rode alone,  for with this interview hanging over me I did not care for the Row. Conrad  joined my father there, and told him that he wanted to marry me, and my father  brought him home to breakfast, and after breakfast he followed me to the  drawing-room. Oh, he is splendid, noble, generous, a king among men! I don&rsquo;t  wonder you are proud of him. We were talking for a long time, heart to heart, and  I promised to be his wife, and we were both as happy as mortal creatures can  be. Are you going to try to part us? Will you break the oath you swore upon  your crucifix&mdash;you, a good Christian? Will you tell him my story?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can do nothing. It is you who must  act. You have known him less than a month. You can&rsquo;t really love him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Juliet had not known Romeo half a dozen  hours.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Juliet! Juliet had not surrendered  herself to a profligate, had not borne a profligate&rsquo;s child. Juliet was not a  precocious sinner. I won&rsquo;t have you for my son&rsquo;s wife. Do you hear, Irene  Thelliston? If I am tongue-tied, it is you who must disillusionise him. You  must do everything that tact and cleverness can do to cure him of his  infatuation without breaking his heart. That is what you have to do.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am to marry any man I can catch,  the highest in the land, so long as I don&rsquo;t marry your son?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to marry my son. He has been  deceived once, cruelly deceived by a girl he thought pure as snow. He has  suffered. He shall not be deceived a second time. I will do anything&mdash;anything  to save him from you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you break your oath?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know. I might be justified even in doing that, to save my son from dishonour.  You think your secret is safely hidden; but I tell you no secret can be kept  for ever&mdash;least of all the secret of a woman&rsquo;s shame. Some witness will rise up  against you. The servant who brought you from India, your child&mdash;or the people  who have the care of your child.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My child only lived a few hours. I had  been too unhappy to bring a new life into the world. My maid is in Australia.  She is an honourable woman, after her lights, and she swore never to betray me.  She will not break her oath.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And your stepmother? Does not she know?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows but my father. That&rsquo;s why we  hate each other.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is horrible. I never look at him  without shuddering at the thought of his contempt. In the midst of new friends  who are kind enough to make much of me, I look across the crowd, and see his  hard face, the face that has never looked at me kindly since I so sorely wanted  a father&rsquo;s kindness. He&mdash;who has such need of pardon for his sins against my  mother&mdash;cannot forgive me. I am a woman, and there is no pardon for a woman&rsquo;s  sin.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your stepmother seems kind to you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is kind, and I accept her  kindness. There are compromises. I live under the same roof with her, though  she helped to break my mother&rsquo;s heart. I don&rsquo;t mean that she was my father&rsquo;s  mistress. I should draw the line at that. But I know that she flirted with him,  and kept him dangling about her when all his time and care ought to have been  given to his dying wife.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be very unhappy in such a home.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t say too much about home. My  father and his wife have made me understand that I am expected to marry before  the end of the season. She buys me nice clothes, and he has given me her horse  for the Park. The clothes and the horse are to get me a husband. Even that slip  of a house is more than my father can comfortably afford. He would be better  off in Ireland. I am to marry&mdash; and to marry well. He is enchanted with your  son&rsquo;s offer.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is a man of the world. Does  he think your Cashmere escapade will never come to light?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary&rsquo;s irritation had got the better  of her womanly feeling. For the moment she was merciless. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have no doubt my father  believes&mdash;as I do&mdash;that Fate will not be so cruel as to hurt me any more.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And your lover&mdash;the wretch who seduced and  deserted you? Is he dead?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never heard of his death.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you were to meet him by-and-by,  as the wife of a man of position. Don&rsquo;t you think that would be rather awkward  for you and for your husband?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. He showed himself a man of  the world when he went away, and made no sign. If we were to meet&mdash;he would show  himself a man of the world again. I have no fear that he would betray me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Or that he would make love to you? And  how about your own feelings? You must have loved him desperately when&mdash;when you  let him spoil your life.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to talk to me like  that,&rdquo; cried the girl, with sudden vehemence. &ldquo;What do you know of such  tragedies&mdash;you with your smooth existence, hedged round with conventionalities,  guarded on every side, you who could hardly have gone wrong if you had been the  most vicious of women? What do you know about me? When I let him spoil my life!  you say&mdash; When I let him! I was seventeen&mdash;and I had been educated by the proper  people who never hint that life has dangers. When I let him! I was in the power  of a profligate, intoxicated with sweet words, with flattered vanity, told for  the first time that I was beautiful, and that I was beloved. What did I know of  love but the sweetness of it&mdash;the love I had read about in Romeo and Juliet&mdash;the  love <em>he</em> read of&mdash;the love of Haidee for Juan&mdash;oh, so  overpoweringly sweet in the ears of ignorance. You don&rsquo;t know&mdash;you can never,  never, never understand!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I can. I am sorry for you. I  blame your seducer, and the woman who left you in his power; the wicked woman  who had the fate of a girl in her keeping, and took no care. I have always been  sorry for you&mdash;but I will not let my son marry you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But you promised me a husband; some good  man who would hear my confession and pity me, and take me to his heart. What  kind of a man was he to be? A village schoolmaster, perhaps, or a curate, a  shopkeeper&rsquo;s son who had won a scholarship and got himself ordained. Someone  second-class.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not marry my son.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you hinder me?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;By every means in my power&mdash;and you may be  sure a mother&rsquo;s intelligence will find the way&mdash; though I may not see it now.  You shall not marry him. I could tell you something about him&mdash;that would scare  you, perhaps, and make you glad to give him up.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You would tell me that seven years of his  young life were wasted in a mad-house. Do you think that would frighten me?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me this morning, before he asked  me to be his wife. Perhaps even you don&rsquo;t know how noble he is&mdash; how frank, and  chivalrous, and true&mdash; a king among men. And can you think that I will give him  up? I have suffered by a man&rsquo;s wickedness, I have drained the cup of sorrow and  shame. I live with a father I hate, and a stepmother I despise. And when a good  man comes to me and offers me a love that leapt into life the night we met,  strangers in one hour, lovers in the next, do you think that I am going to  let my true love go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have any sense of honour you  cannot marry him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But I might marry the other man&mdash;the  curate &mdash;or the schoolmaster? Remember what you said to me. I had only to tell  him my story. If the worst comes to the worst I can tell Conrad.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think he would forgive you?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he would. I should make him  very miserable; it would be a cruel thing to do. It would take the bloom off  our love and our happiness; but he would not send me away. I have grown into  his heart. He could not do without me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She had calmed herself after her burst of  passion, and her face grew radiant as she spoke of her lover. She paused before  the mantelpiece for a moment or two, while she adjusted her hat, and smiled at  the brilliant reflection. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He loves me, Lady Mary, and I can make  him happy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You had better be kind. Let the dead bury their dead.  Just take time, and think things over quietly.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She moved towards the door, while Lady  Mary stood with an adamantine countenance and forgot even to ring the bell. She  held out her hand at parting, but Lady Mary would not take it. </p>
<p>Half-way downstairs she met Conrad, who  caught her in his arms, surprised and rapturous. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My angel! You have been with my mother?  You have told her? I was just going to her. How sweet of you!&mdash;She ought to be  delighted.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She is hardly that&mdash;as yet. It is so  sudden&mdash; so dreadfully quick&mdash;for a mother. But she will be pleased by-and-by,  when she knows me better. I am going to make you happy, Conrad, oh, so happy!&rdquo; </p>
<p>She let her head sink upon his breast,  half swooning in the sudden reaction from the scene above-stairs, and he  smothered her face with kisses, and had no memory of a face almost as lovely  that had nestled there and been kissed as fondly by a passionate lad of twenty,  eight years&rsquo; ago. </p>
<p>When does the new love remember the old? </p>
<p>They had the spacious landing all to  themselves just long enough for this little love scene, in the shelter of tall  palms and the cool light filtered through Venetian shutters; and  then an electric bell rang sharply, the servants were on the alert in the hall  below, and Conrad had to behave with circumspection as he escorted his  sweetheart to the door and went out with her. That she should walk alone to  Chapel Street, that radiant creature whose dazzling beauty challenged every  eye, would have been out of the question. He went with her, and they made a  detour by Park Lane and Green Street, and they talked, as only newly-plighted  lovers can, of a future of ineffable bliss. </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8</strong> </h2>
<p>Mary Harling was beaten.  She had the ever-present memory of what the doctors had said to her, that grave  warning of peril; and, with the revelation of her son&rsquo;s impassioned temperament  which every day was brought more vividly before her mind, she could hardly  question the medical verdict. This fine brain was too nearly allied with the  heart to stand the shock of an unhappy love. The same kind of trouble that had  been fatal to him in his twentieth year might again be fatal; since in every  characteristic, in every feeling and impulse he seemed no older at  eight-and-twenty than he had been as an undergraduate. It might be that those  years at Roehampton counted for nothing, and that he was still in the dawn of  manhood, eager and impetuous, seeking the blue flower of joy with a fervour  that would not brook disappointment. </p>
<p>Lady Mary felt that her armoury was  exhausted. She had used her strongest weapons, and her sword had bent in her  hand, her gun had missed fire. The girl had met threats and entreaties with the  same indomitable spirit. The girl meant to marry her son. No hope remained but  in Machiavelian tactics, and Lady Mary felt that she must take things quietly,  and exert her utmost power of Machiavelianism. </p>
<p>Conrad&rsquo;s light foot came bounding up the  stair while she still sat before her writing-table disconsolate, just as she  had sunk down when the girl left her. He dashed into the room, bringing the  breath of summer and youth and happiness with him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, dear mother! She has told you!  She came herself to tell you. Could anything be sweeter? Of course she must  adore you. She who has no real mother. You are not going to lose a son. You are  going to gain a daughter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He was on his knees by her chair; he had  seized her cold hand and was kissing it, in a fever of filial love. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mother, tell me you are pleased.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ah, what a struggle it cost, the wan  smile, the low murmur. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be content, if my dear son is  happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you not have chosen her? Is she  not all you would have chosen?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no choice. I have never thought of  choosing. I only wanted my dearest to be happy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am going to be happy, divinely  happy. I feel as if this earth I tread on had been changed to an Olympian  cloud. I walk on air! I am breathless in a rarefied atmosphere. Think what it  is to me, mother, to find this pure and perfect pearl &mdash; after the disillusion  of my youth &mdash; when my goddess, my angel, the creature I almost worshipped, was  shown to me in a moment&mdash;without a note of warning&mdash;as the most worthless of her  sex&mdash;a hypocrite and a liar&mdash;a prize-fighter&rsquo;s light o&rsquo; love! Can you wonder that  my mind gave way under the shock?&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was a silence, while Conrad still  knelt, his mother&rsquo;s head bent over him, her arms about his neck. </p>
<p>Oh, the agony  of it; to know that he was again deceived, that this new angel who brought him  ineffable bliss was a mock angel, and that at any moment the mask might drop,  and he might know himself again the dupe of second-hand charms. To know this,  and to be unable to undeceive him, constrained to silence by so dreadful a  fear! </p>
<p>Her oath might perhaps have been as  nothing to her&mdash;the sin of perjury might have lain lightly on her conscience&mdash;had  it been for his interest to tell him the cruel truth. But she could not speak  words that would crush him in the dawn of joy, at the risk of a shattered mind  and a life ruined for ever. Better that he should be happy in his own way,  perhaps never to be undeceived. It might be, as the girl said, that no witness  would ever rise up against her; and it might be that she loved Conrad as he  deserved to be loved. She who had so suffered might love better than the  sinless and the untried. Her affection ought to be so much the stronger for her  gratitude to him who taught her the divinity of a good man&rsquo;s love. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, you are crying! Is that the way  you welcome joyful news?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, there are always two sides to  a question. I want you to be happy&mdash;but we have been all the world to each  other, you and I. You must allow something for a mother&rsquo;s jealousy. And then I  have been thinking of Daisy&mdash;poor Daisy!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why poor? Daisy and Irene will be capital  friends. We shall take Daisy about with us on the motor. Daisy will have a good  time doing gooseberry.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be  quite a good time, do you think? To be a third, and rather in the way, after  the long rides with you in Hampshire, the croquet, the billiards, the time when  you devoted yourself to her all day long, so that I almost thought&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You almost thought I was falling in love  with her&mdash;and I thought so too, ma&rsquo;am, and one day&mdash; one heavenly May morning  when the world seemed enchanted&mdash;I was on the brink of a proposal. We had ridden  to the edge of the Forest, we were in that lonely wood, you know, in the valley  beyond Ringwood, and I felt like a man under a spell. I was almost drunk with  the rapture of life in that green woodland, under that azure sky &mdash; and Daisy  seemed the spirit of the wood, a most enchanting hamadryad in a neat little  riding-habit. I was nearly gone when I remembered that <em>au fond</em> my feelings  were simply cousinly, or even brotherly &mdash; and that no doubt Daisy had just the  same temperate affection for me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that, Conrad. I am  afraid your kindness in those happy days at Cranford may have turned her head a  little. She is very sensitive.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And she is six-and-twenty&mdash;heads don&rsquo;t  spin round easily at that age&mdash;and it is only a mother who believes that every  girl in the world must find her son irresistible. Daisy and I are comrades and  friends, and always will be, if she takes to Irene; as I feel  sure she will.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest,&rdquo; and again there were signs  of tears. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, why this dolefulness? Is not  my love a lady, the daughter of a man who has fought for his country, and won  his Sovereign&rsquo;s recognition? Is not my love fair?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Too fair, too fair! Oh, Conrad, can&rsquo;t you  understand that I am fearful of a love that is founded only upon beauty. It  fills me with fear when I see my son the slave of a lovely face. What do you  know of Miss Thelliston except that she is beautiful? Your father and I had  known each other for more than a year before he asked me to marry him. I knew  all about him&mdash;his conduct&mdash;his opinions&mdash;his religion. I knew that I was giving  myself to a man who would never disappoint me, who would be husband, friend,  counsellor, all the world to me; as he was, till death took him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The rush of tears that came after those  words seemed natural, and Conrad was not offended. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest of mothers, yours was an ideal  courtship in the old-fashioned jog-trot way. But I belong to a swifter-moving  generation, and I yearn for the poetry of life. Remember how your favourite  Shakespeare said, &lsquo;He never loved that loved not at first sight.&rsquo; I have no  doubt that my father was in love with you all that year of your acquaintance,  though he was not so impetuous as I am. Come now, ma&rsquo;am, let us all be happy.  Open your heart to my sweet love, and every day will make you fonder of her.  By-the-bye, why didn&rsquo;t you ask her to come back to luncheon? She wouldn&rsquo;t come  for my asking.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you must make her welcome, ma&rsquo;am,  you must make her feel that she belongs to us, and that she is not to stand  upon punctilio. I don&rsquo;t. I told her to tell Lady Thelliston that I was going to  lunch with them, and, by Jove! it&rsquo;s twenty minutes past one, and they lunch at  half-past.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Conrad got up, shook himself, like a dog  in good spirits, and was at the door when his mother asked: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going anywhere this afternoon?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;To Richmond on the Mercedes. Tell Daisy  to be ready at a quarter to four. We shall have tea at the &lsquo;Star.&rsquo; Will you  drive down and join us?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, it&rsquo;s too far.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be back in time for a stroll in  the Park. I shall expect to find you there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He was gone&mdash;gone to the new love and the  new life. Come what might, no word nor act of hers must bring about the ruin of  his hopes. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Henceforward Conrad&rsquo;s courtship went on  velvet. Everybody seemed to rejoice in the joy of these young lovers, since the  two persons to whom that sudden betrothal brought pain instead of joy had to  smoothe their brows and to hide a stricken heart with a smile. It was only when Conrad told Daisy Meredith of his  engagement, and entreated her warmest regard for his future wife, that she knew  how dear he had become to her, or the dream she had cherished that she had  become dear to him. </p>
<p>Conrad had been so kind, so cruelly, so  fatally kind in those glad days at Cranford. He had seemed so completely  content with life in her society, while every day had brought them some new  discovery of mutual tastes, opinions, sympathies, from trivial things, the love  of a dog, a horse, a flower, or some particular phase in the sky, the earth,  the atmosphere, to the highest, the deeply-felt need of a Personal God, the  anxious belief in the Hereafter. </p>
<p>In a moment that dream had vanished. He  might still be her friend. In telling her of his new happiness he had dwelt  upon his affection for her, had urged her to be to his wife as a sister. But he  could never more be as he had been in that golden May time, the blossoming  season of her life, the season in which life had been more than life, and earth  had ceased to be earthy. </p>
<p>Not for worlds would she have appeared  disappointed or forlorn. She had that fine feminine pluck which can look upon  the funeral pyre of love and smile. She played her poor little part of gooseberry  with grace and vivacity. She was never in the way, and never out of the way  when wanted. She suffered the rush and noise of the Mercedes, the dust of the  roads, the monotony of afternoon teas, that whether at Richmond, or Esher, or  Wimbledon, or Windsor, were always the image of each other. </p>
<p>She talked when she was wanted to talk,  and was always absorbed in the landscape when the lovers began to whisper  confidences, those mysterious confidences which engaged young men and maidens  have to impart to each other. She did all that the situation demanded, with a  face that beamed with intelligence, and a heart heavier than lead. The shabby  house at Holloway, the bickering parents, the slovenly parlour-maid, would have seemed a haven of peace, but she was too  proud to fly. Someone might get an inkling of her secret, if she were to show  the faintest distaste for her sickening office. Happily for her there was a  limit to her martyrdom, for the wedding was to take place in August; Sir  Michael and his future son-in-law being of one opinion as to the needlessness  of delay, while Irene had consented readily to an early marriage. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were to be engaged for years I  could not trust you more than I do now,&rdquo; she told her lover. &ldquo;I know how good  you are. I know how happy we are going to be.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That was the song she sang to him in all  those joyous days. They were going to be happy. She was going to make him  happy. It was the string she harped upon on love&rsquo;s mystical lyre. </p>
<p>Material arrangements are easy when the  suitor has thirty thousand a year. Lady Mary insisted upon giving up Cranford;  but she would of course retain the house in Hertford Street, which was hers for  life. Conrad and Irene had the joy of house-hunting among their other  pleasures; and house-hunting, when rent is no object, is as joyous a business  as it is weary and wearing for small purses. Even in this Daisy had to assist,  scaling four-storey staircases in Hill Street and Charles Street, and Green  Street, and Norfolk Street, till after days of exploration a small house was  discovered in Park Lane, which was the situation Irene had desired from the  first. </p>
<p>After the discovery of the ideal house  there came consultations and fierce discussions with the ideal architect&mdash;that  is to say, the architect at the top of the mode that season, who was something  of an autocrat, and wanted his own way about every detail; so that at last  Conrad had to remind him that it was he and his wife who would have to live in  the house, and that however perfect it might be as a work of art, it would be  hard lines if they did not like it. </p>
<p>When, however, this famous artist sent in  drawings of the house as it was to be after he had worked his will upon it, the  blue windows and pale pink walls, and delicate touches of watercolour, had such  a Ruskinesque effect that Irene was all for letting the architect have a free  hand, and finally it was agreed that he should alter and bedevil the house,  until nothing but the mere shell of the original structure would remain, that  which had been kitchen becoming wine-cellar, and servants&rsquo; bedrooms being  transformed into kitchens, all inner walls on the first and second floor being  removed, leaving vast spaces where there had been small rooms, and ceilings  supported by steel girders and a pilaster or two. </p>
<p>Daisy told Lady Mary that she liked the  original telescopic drawing-rooms better, the positive, comparative, and  superlative, expanding from a boudoir not much bigger than a powder closet at  the back of the house, through a smallish middle room, to a somewhat spacious  drawing-room with three French windows opening on a balcony. The Early  Victorian balcony was to disappear, and the three windows were to become one,  stone-mullioned, mediaeval, with a deep window seat, and leaded casements to  let in the rain. There was to be nothing more recent than the period of Francis  the First and Diane de Poictiers. </p>
<p>This transmogrification would take time,  and the house would not be ready till next season. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Sir Michael and Lady Thelliston went to  Hampshire in the Panhard with the lovers, to see the place which was to be  their daughter&rsquo;s country home; and all things were admired and approved. Irene  had not Daisy&rsquo;s way of looking at horses and dogs, nor did she walk straight  into the hearts of the Irish setters, as Daisy had done; but she admired the  fine old quadrangle of red brick and stone, where stables and saddle-rooms, and  coach-houses and grooms&rsquo; quarters were dignified by the spaciousness of the  enclosure, and the stone basin round which the pigeons clustered, where there had  been a fountain that had not played within the memory of man. She admired the  large rooms, the broad oak balusters and carved newels of the staircase, the  grandeur and spaciousness everywhere. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this really to be my house?&rdquo; she said,  with a glad little laugh that Conrad thought enchanting. </p>
<p>They lunched in the large dining-room  where the round table looked like an island in an ocean of Turkey carpet. They  were a cosy party of four, Daisy not being required on this occasion; and it  mattered nothing to Conrad that his future father-in-law had a cold, cruel  face, or that his future mother-in-law&rsquo;s complexion was a curious and  instructive spectacle in the clear light of a July noontide. Conrad knew  nothing, he cared for nothing, save the girl by whose side he was sitting, and  whose slender grace as she moved about the rooms that were to be her own had  enthralled him. They had roamed over the house, hand in hand, exploring rooms  and corridors, looking at family portraits, from Lawrence to Buckner, the first  Harling of any importance having been painted by the former master. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ours isn&rsquo;t a long pedigree,&rdquo; Conrad said,  laughing. &ldquo;We only date from Sir Thomas Lawrence.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but on your mother&rsquo;s side.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Duke&rsquo;s family tree begins with  King Stephen&rsquo;s armour-bearer, and the family is as rusty as the armour that  hangs in the Castle hall.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Irene was enthusiastic about the  billiard-room and library, with a door of communication. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall sit here and read after dinner,  while you and your friends play,&rdquo; she said, looking at the shelves, where every  book she had ever heard of or desired seemed to be waiting for her, books  having been one of Mr. Harling&rsquo;s vanities, exquisite books in exquisite  bindings. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>The trousseau was a business that occupied  many mornings. Sir Michael being too much a man of the world to hold his hand  when his daughter was marrying thirty thousand a year, and when her settlement  was to be exceptionally generous, nothing asked from the bride&rsquo;s people, and  everything given. Irene herself showed indifference about her wedding clothes,  rare in any young woman, rarer perhaps in an old woman. She allowed her  stepmother and the dressmaker to choose and settle everything, only stipulating  that most of her frocks should be white, and that her trousseau should be  planned with a view to foreign travel rather than to display at home. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be wandering about the world  till next season,&rdquo; she told Madame Herminie, &ldquo;and I shall go to any queer wild  places my husband wants to see; so you must give me no useless finery.&rdquo; But  when the suave and expensive Herminie heard of a winter in Egypt, she protested  that madam would want more evening frocks and smarter evening coats than if she  were staying in London. </p>
<p>Irene shrugged her shoulders disdainfully. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to parties at huge  hotels,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am going to live in a felucca or under canvas with my  husband.&rdquo; </p>
<p>My husband! The word charmed her. She had  never dreamed of this joyous love, never hoped to be so honoured and so  cherished, she who had suffered the dull despair of a young life that has no  fair outlook. Fate had been good to her after all. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Only one thing troubled Conrad in this  joyous time, and that was a certain want of cordiality between his mother and  the girl of his heart. In vulgar parlance, these two whom he loved best in the  world did not take to each other. </p>
<p>Lady Mary was courteous, and Irene was  unfailing in all proper marks of respect for the lady&rsquo;s age and position; but  there were no signs of growing intimacy, still less of affection. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would be so fond of my  mother,&rdquo; he said one day, with almost a note of reproach. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be fond of her when she is fond  of me,&rdquo; Irene answered, &ldquo;but that has to come. Perhaps when we have been  married a year or two, and I have made you happy, the ice will melt.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Women are inscrutable. I made sure that  you would love each other. She never had a daughter, and you who loved your  mother so dearly&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearly,  dearly, dearly. Don&rsquo;t speak of her. Don&rsquo;t make me think of her, and her last  days upon this earth, when I counted every breath she drew, hung upon every  word&mdash;faint words&mdash;at long intervals&mdash;and when I knew that each word might be the  last.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He caught her to his heart. He kissed away  her tears. Never, never would he again invoke a memory that grieved her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother will adore you by-and-by,&rdquo; he  said, and then in a lower voice he asked: &ldquo;Can you guess when she will love you  best?&rdquo; </p>
<p>He whispered the answer to his own  question. &ldquo;When our first-born child is laid in her arms.&rdquo; Irene&rsquo;s head drooped  lower on his breast, and the lips that were hidden from him were mute. She  clung to him in silence, and he felt the hurried beating of her heart, and knew  he had distressed her, but could not understand why. </p>
<p>Conrad never spoke to her again about her  relations with his mother, comforting himself with the assurance that intimacy  and affection would come in good time. Irene had spoken words of wisdom. His  mother would love the woman who gave happiness to her son. Perhaps such close  relations must always begin with a little aversion, or at least with some  distrust. </p>
<p>After her terrible interview with Lady  Mary, Irene had resolved never to bend her neck before a woman who had so  outraged her pride of womanhood. Whatever love or kindness was to come in the  future should come unsought. She would never plead <em>in forma  pauperis</em>, never take the lower ground of acknowledged guilt. Strong  in Conrad&rsquo;s love she would defy the world. She had brought her father to her  feet, after years of unkindness. He fawned upon her, he praised and admired  her, and made believe that no cloud had ever crossed her sky. He even talked  freely before Conrad of her life in Ireland, hidden in a rustic village, with  an aunt who worshipped her. </p>
<p>Nobody had ever told him of any such  worship. The idea was spontaneous. </p>
<p>Lady Mary wondered at the girl&rsquo;s calm  front, and perhaps, in her heart of hearts, admired her for being so quietly  defiant, so self-assured and resolute. The calmness under deeply agitating  conditions indicated good blood, was indeed as much a sign and token of race as  her small feet and delicate hands, and all those other marks of refinement in  her beautiful person. A girl of mean birth would have trembled and cringed. </p>
<p>And so the summer days went by, fleet and  sweet as summer days can be when people are ineffably happy. The lovers were  rarely parted between early morning in the Row and the small hours after a  ball, except in the inevitable time which the least vain of young women must  sacrifice to the exigencies of London clothes. First came the morning ride, and  after breakfast a walk or shopping; and then luncheon in Chapel Street, or  perhaps one of Lady Mary&rsquo;s luncheon parties, which she could not desist from  giving all at once. </p>
<p>She had, indeed, to do more entertaining  now that her son was engaged to be married. </p>
<p>In the afternoons there were long jaunts  in one of the motors, and on opera nights there was an early dinner in Hertford  Street, and an evening in Lady Mary&rsquo;s capacious box; and there were occasional  dinner parties, and dances almost every night, dances to which the pretty Miss  Thelliston was always bidden, dances with chaperons, and friendly little dances  without chaperons, so that scarcely a night passed in that enchanting July when  Conrad&rsquo;s arms were not encircling his betrothed in the waltz they both loved,  and in which they both excelled. </p>
<p>Then there were the suburban races,  Sandown and Kempton, to which Conrad carried Irene and his cousin, with some  agreeable youth or middle-aged swain to make a fourth and amuse Daisy. Captain  Mansfeld was the favourite, as he was keen on racing, and knew the lineage and  previous performances of every horse, and the merits and peculiarities of every  jockey. </p>
<p>It was one Saturday afternoon at Sandown,  under tropical sunshine, in the mob of overpowering frocks and hats, and more  or less attractive faces, that they met a man who had achieved a momentary  distinction by the purchase of a famous Derby winner, and by the success of one  of his own horses at the Newmarket First Spring meeting. He had a horse running  at Sandown this afternoon, and had that peculiar air of suppressed agitation  common to owners when their luck trembles in the balance, and in this  condition, with eyes brightened as with fever, and a certain over-alertness of  movement and manner, he ran against Captain Mansfeld, who was walking with  Daisy Meredith, while Conrad and Irene sauntered after them. It was still early  in the afternoon, and the most important race was yet to come. </p>
<p>The man had a loud voice, resonant, and  not unmelodious, and they could hear every word as they approached. It was all  about his horse, and the chances for and against. </p>
<p>He was a large man, tall and  broad-shouldered, handsome, commanding of aspect, a man who looked as if he had  once been a soldier, well set up still, but a little out of training. Idleness  and high living had set their mark upon the magnificent figure, and the face  was one upon which high thinking had never been expressed. It was perfect from  the sculptor&rsquo;s point of view, but the beauty was purely physical, the type  suggestive of the arena and not of the forum. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Come round and look at Horoscope before  they saddle him: if Miss Meredith is fond of horses she&rsquo;ll appreciate his good  looks,&rdquo; he was saying, having in a manner forced Mansfeld to introduce him to  the young lady; and then as Conrad and his sweetheart approached, he turned and  met them face to face. </p>
<p>He looked at Irene with a surprise that  was instantaneous, and then with an expectant look that obliged her to  recognise him. She bowed, ever so slightly, and walked on, quickening her pace,  with her large white sunshade lowered a little, so that her face was hidden. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that man?&rdquo; asked Conrad, with  a lover&rsquo;s jealous distrust of any stranger who presumes to claim acquaintance  with the beloved. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him years ago in India.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a friend of Sir Michael&rsquo;s?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think my father knows him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But you met  him?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in Cashmere; he was a friend of my  cousin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he in the army?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was in the Grenadiers. But he had  left the army and was travelling &mdash; for his amusement.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have him in the Guards perhaps;  he doesn&rsquo;t look their sort.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Something indefinite&mdash;something I don&rsquo;t  want to put into plain words. Some men are born so, men whose blood is of the  deepest blue, and whose ancestors were fine gentlemen in the first Crusade.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You condemn him on rather slight  evidence&mdash; never having even talked to him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard him talk just now; bragging about  his horse, wanting my cousin to go and look at the brute. Out of his own mouth  he has condemned himself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry your cousin had to suffer the  burden of his acquaintance.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There had been no change in Irene&rsquo;s voice  or manner as she talked of the man, not the faintest sign of fear or distress;  yet this chance meeting was one of the dark moments of life. She felt the hand  of fate upon her. She had hugged herself with the assurance that she would  never see that face again, never hear again the voice that had once charmed  her. To-day she saw him as Conrad saw him&mdash;with a deep disgust. Handsome? Yes!  Splendid as common clay unillumined by soul can be&mdash;an earth-man, in whom there  was no sign of the immortal mind. </p>
<p>She wondered if he had changed utterly  from the man she had once loved&mdash;the man to whom she gave her childish admiration, her  childish trust, the man who had pursued her with a passionate insistance from  the hour when her eyes first looked up at him with a schoolgirl&rsquo;s innocent  admiration of a magnificent being, the typical Guardsman of the romantic novel. </p>
<p>She had been able to control voice and  manner, but she could not command her colour; and presently when they were  sitting at tea, and she could no longer shelter herself under her parasol,  Conrad exclaimed at her pallor. She had been walking in the sun. It was his  fault. He was as much distressed as if he had taken her unawares through a  plague-stricken city. He was sure that her head ached, that she was almost  fainting. All her protestations to the contrary were useless. </p>
<p>He looked appealingly at Daisy. What had  better to be done? Should they go home directly after tea? Perhaps he could  find a doctor who would prescribe something. He could run to a chemist at Esher  to get a prescription made up. He looked as troubled as if death were in the  air. </p>
<p>Irene protested that she had no headache. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let us sit quietly somewhere, out  of the sun. That is all I want. Perhaps Daisy will sit with me in some shady  corner while you and Captain Mansfeld look at the race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I should leave you!&rdquo; cried Conrad  reproachfully. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you my word I am not going to  die,&rdquo; said Irene, with a silvery laugh that was reassuring. </p>
<p>He told Mansfeld and Daisy to go and amuse  themselves, and to be at the gate ready for the drive home, at a quarter to  seven; and then he went off with Irene, away from the race-course and the  crowd, to stroll on Esher Common. </p>
<p>It was Irene who suggested the Common. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a relief to be away from all  those frocks and hats,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind not seeing the race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I should mind: as if I wanted to  see anything in the world except your face! When that looks pale and wan my  world collapses. You gave me a scare just now, Irene; but a little bit of pink  has come back; just the ghost of your morning colour, when we meet in the Park  and I say to myself: here comes my rose of June.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>They were to dine at Hertford Street at  half-past seven, as it was an opera night, <em>Don  Giovarini</em>, the old music they both adored, having that uneducated love  of music which must be sustained with melody. </p>
<p>Irene was in beauty again when they met  the other two at the gate. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A pity you lost the race,&rdquo; said Mansfeld.  &ldquo;There was some fine riding, and Middlemore&rsquo;s horse won by half a length. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Middlemore?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner of the favourite. The man who  was talking to me when you and Miss Thelliston joined us.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that his name? Irene knew him in  Cashmere; at least, he was an acquaintance of her cousin&rsquo;s. Not a very  desirable acquaintance, I should think. But if he&rsquo;s a friend of yours I&rsquo;ve  nothing to say against him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is anything to be  said against him&mdash;except that he wasn&rsquo;t popular in his regiment. His father was  a manufacturer somewhere in the north&mdash;and Middlemore had plenty of money when  he was in the regiment, and I believe he spent it royally.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But if his money is gone how does he come  by a racing stable?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, his father is rich enough to keep him  going. He&rsquo;s an only son, and he married an American girl &mdash; a millionaire&rsquo;s  orphan daughter from Boston, very refined and nice&mdash;but not handsome.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she with him to-day?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She crossed the Atlantic in her  coffin last March&mdash;to lie in the family vault with her New England ancestors.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This was while they waited for the motor.  There was not much more talk after they had taken their seats, and Conrad had  his mind and his hands occupied in steering through the crowd of carriage  people who hated motors, and motor people who hated other motors; no time for  more than an occasional word to the two girls sitting behind him, muffled in  their white cloaks and veils, no opportunity for any confidences till the  Mercedes stopped before the white door in Chapel Street and Irene alighted. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a quarter of an hour to dress,&rdquo; said  Conrad, as he handed her out. &ldquo;I shall send the motor back for you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t trouble. I can have a cab.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Too slow. My mother is a dragon of  punctuality.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Irene was nearly as white as her chiffon  frock when she appeared in Lady Mary&rsquo;s drawing-room &mdash;and again Conrad protested  that it was his fault for having kept her on the lawn in the glaring sunshine.  She had struggled against that deadly faintness during her hurried toilet, the  maid doing everything that her own active hands usually did, and dressing her  as if she had been a doll. She dared not look at herself in the glass. A great  dread had come upon her since she had known that Henry Middlemore was free. </p>
<p>She talked gaily enough to satisfy her  lover while they were at dinner, and afterwards at the opera when the curtain  was down. Him she might deceive, but she saw Lady Mary watching her with an uneasy  expression. She who was in the secret of the past no doubt divined that a worse  trouble than a walk in the afternoon sun had blanched that perfect face.  Happily there was no dance that Saturday night, nowhere to go after the opera,  which was over early. Sir Michael and his wife were dining out, and had not  come home when Lady Mary&rsquo;s landau brought Irene to her door, and her lover  murmured his last fond words at parting. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No Row to-morrow; but you would not be  well enough to ride if it were a lawful day. I shall call early to ask about  you&mdash;but you mustn&rsquo;t come down to breakfast or go and sit in a stifling church.  If you have rested and are well enough for a stroll in Hamilton Gardens at one  o&rsquo;clock, I will get my aunt&rsquo;s key. You shan&rsquo;t be stared at and pointed at in  the Park.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t keep Lady Mary waiting.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She was glad  when the door closed upon him. His tenderness could not comfort her. All around  her was dark. She felt as if she had suddenly become blind, and must grope her  way among unknown obstacles. </p>
<p>There was a letter lying on the  hall-table, a thick letter with a large staring scarlet seal, like a gout of  blood, she thought. </p>
<p>The servant picked it up and carried it to  her on a salver, as she went towards the staircase. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A messenger brought it, ma&rsquo;am, after ten  o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She had divined, without seeing the  address, that it was for her. </p>
<p>A carriage stopped at the door as she ran  upstairs, and she heard her father&rsquo;s voice in the hall before she could get  into her room. The dinner party had been later than usual, and no one but the  servants had seen the letter. She locked her door to keep out the French maid  who was Lady Thelliston&rsquo;s servant, and who had very little respite from her  assistance in those elaborate arts which maintain fictitious beauty. What  scanty leisure she had was at Miss Thelliston&rsquo;s service, and she was called a  joint maid. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Irene switched on the light and flung  herself into a chair by the open window to read her letter. She knew the hand,  too well, too well. How many surreptitious scraps of notes had been secretly  delivered&mdash;in her book&mdash;in her fan&mdash;in the loop of a sash&mdash;in a bunch of tropical  flowers? Dear, dear letters they had been to her in those foolish days, before  the knowledge of evil. Letters telling her she had looked lovelier than ever at  the ball last night&mdash;had danced divinely&mdash;in a word that she was adorable. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that delicious pink frock! You were  like Venus in a rosy cloud. I think there is something of that sort in Virgil.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Adorable, adorable, adorable! The scraps  of bold manly writing all sang the same song: all told her she was lovely and  beloved, and all pleaded for more intimate moments&mdash;a walk in the compound in  the moonlight&mdash;a <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> ride&mdash;some  sweet solitude of two that was to be managed somehow; some evasion of her  chaperon, some escape from the crowd. His brain was fertile in expedients. He  was always telling her how to elude the people whose duty it was to  take care of her, always teaching her how to deceive. </p>
<p>Those little scraps of praise and love had  been very dear, for it was thrilling to the inexperienced girl to know herself  the central point of a strong man&rsquo;s thoughts, the absorbing interest of his  life&mdash;to be told of sleepless nights spent in thinking of her, of days that were  pain and grief because they had to be spent away from her. </p>
<p>And now the same strong penmanship was a  thing of horror, a thing that recalled the folly, the degradation of that  miserable past. </p>
<p>Every word in that long letter was like a  drop of molten lead, for to her the letter might mean doom. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My darling, </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I have spent a weary hour hunting for  your address. The beautiful Miss Thelliston! That&rsquo;s what people call you. I had  heard of the beautiful Miss Thelliston; but I had actually forgotten your  surname, and it never occurred to me that this much-admired she was my Haidee,  my child-wife, the only girl I ever loved with the whole force and passion of  my soul. Ah, dearest child, you cannot have forgotten the night when I lay at  your feet, and would have gladly died there rather than take up the burden of  life with another woman. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;But I had to take up my burden. The  fragile creature to whom I had pledged myself would have died if I had  forsaken her. Those who knew her best, the aunt who had brought her up, the  cousin who was like a sister, had warned me that to her sensitive nature  disillusion would be fatal. </p>
<p class="note">It was not her fortune that tempted me,  for my expectations from my father made me careless of that. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I had to choose between my divine girl  and the woman older than me by a year, who believed in me and depended upon me  for the happiness of her life. Irene would soon forget the romantic dream of an  Indian summer, a fairy tale of the hills and rose gardens; but my Boston  sweetheart would not forget. She had given me the deep love of a thoughtful  self-contained woman. I could not cheat her. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;She was a dear and devoted wife, and I  think she was happy with me. She never knew that she was not the first and only  woman who had ever held my heart. She died in my arms after a year of troubled  health, during which I did everything that care and science could do to keep  her alive. She left me rich and childless, free to begin life again&mdash;but with  very little interest in anything except my racing stud&mdash;which had amused and  pleased her&mdash;and in a rubber at Bridge. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Then in a moment your face flashed upon  me, and I knew that life was worth living. I am free, dearest, I am a free man  now. The times are changed since that day when I stood before your cousin  feeling like a beaten hound, pretending that I had thought of you only as an  enchanting child, the sweet companion of an idle day&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash; the girl I  adored, my Haidee, my bride! Well, it was hard lines for us both; but we have a  long life of happiness waiting for us, a life that will make amends. You are  still in the dawn of girlhood, very little older than in those wild days, and  ever so much lovelier. I am not by any means an old fogey, and to have you for  my own will make me young again. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dearest, let it be soon. Every day will  seem an age till I have you in my arms, my own till death. We can be married  quietly, and just slip away to Italy on our way to India, and that romantic  valley where we met. Think how delicious it would be to revisit the place where  we were so happy, to wander once again in those enchanting scenes where we  first knew the rapture of mutual love. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;For my own part I think it will save all  troublesome explanations if we keep everything dark till after we are safely  married, and have left England. You can meet me in the Park some morning, and  we can be married by special license at the least frequented church in your  parish; but if, on the other hand, you prefer to tell your father that you are  going to marry me, having known and liked me years ago as a chance acquaintance  in Cashmere, he will naturally inquire about my means. In that case you can  tell him I can afford to make a liberal settlement, and that I feel sure I can  satisfy him. My wife left me all her fortune, including her property in  Yorkshire&mdash;an estate bought soon after our marriage&mdash;big farms and substantial  homesteads, a fine park and a picturesque Jacobean house, which I know my Irene  will love&mdash;as she will love the horses that have been my one extravagance of  late years. But my bright bird shall never be caged in her country home an hour  longer than she is supremely happy there. She shall have all the world to roam  over at her own sweet will, with a husband whose delight will be to please her.  Let me have a letter to-morrow morning by a messenger. This hotel is not half a  mile from your house. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Your devoted<br>
&ldquo;Hal. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Saturday  night.<br>
&ldquo;The Carlton Hotel.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This was his letter. This was the offer  that he made in good faith, never for a moment doubting her acceptance. She  belonged to him by that shameful past, that past of which he could write so  lightly, having known only the sweetness of it. One bad half hour with her  chaperon; one passionate outbreak of remorse, in the dead of the Indian night;  just a few curses and groans and tears; and his price had been paid. He loved  and he rode away. The light love was forgotten perhaps, and had only revived at  sight of her, a new fancy, selfish, impetuous, as the old passion. </p>
<p>And her year of ignominy and suffering, that  unhappy time in which she hardly dared to lift her eyes before the few people  who came to her aunt&rsquo;s house, the priest, the parson, the hunting squire and  his wife and daughters. Her aunt&rsquo;s friends were not many; but she hated them  all. Her pride grew fiercer in that secret humiliation. No one knew, no one was  ever to know! Her aunt, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, was a resolute managing woman, but  not unkind, not without compassion. The youth of the victim weighed with her.  The father had thought chiefly, or solely, of the disgrace, the trouble, and  inconvenience for himself. His sister could pity the girl whose innocence had  been the cause of her fall. </p>
<p>Irene&rsquo;s health had broken down soon after  her arrival in Ireland, and she had been ill enough to be kept in seclusion,  waited on and nursed by her aunt, till the hour of her trial drew near, and then  aunt and niece went unattended to an obscure sea-side village in the West, more  than a hundred miles from Mrs. Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s home; and here, though the aunt  gave her own name, the niece was described as Mrs. Brown, whose husband was  soldiering in India. </p>
<p>Mrs. Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s air of impeccable  respectability, a certain authoritativeness that argued social status, left no  room for question. The landlady was delighted to have such lodgers at the end  of the season, when her usual tenants were gone. </p>
<p>To-night, sitting with her hands clasped  above her head, and Henry Middlemore&rsquo;s letter before her, Irene lived over that  dreadful time. Imagination brought back the moaning of the Atlantic in the long  sleepless nights, while she thought of what her life was to be as the mother of  a nameless child. Love had died the death between the night of agonised  farewell and these hours of weary waiting. And when her aunt, sitting by her  bed in the deep of night&mdash;when she felt in her utter weakness as if she were  drifting upon a sluggish river, drifting to darkness and ease&mdash;told her very  gently that her child was dead, and that her secret and her shame had died with  him, she had neither the sorrow of a  woman  with the maternal instinct, nor the thankfulness of a worldling. </p>
<p>She thought and hoped that she too would  soon be dead, and that she had come to the last link in the chain of misery.  Had he not made her suffer, this man, who wrote so glibly, and offered her the  delight of revisiting the scenes fraught with such bitter memories? What of  happiness had she ever known from the night they parted, till she met Conrad  Harling, and knew the meaning of a good man&rsquo;s love? Her dearest, her truest,  most generous, most chivalrous of men, in whose large heart no taint of  self-love had ever entered! </p>
<p>And was she to surrender that noble lover,  to give herself to the man whose sensual passion had blighted her life, the  unscrupulous seducer, who could not respect the innocence of a girl just  escaped from a school where evil things were unknown, where every book and  every lesson, every allusion to the outer world, was chosen with a studious  reverence for youthful purity. </p>
<p>This man must be answered. She knew how  impatient, how persistent he could be, how in that brief time when she had  begun to fear him, with some instinctive prescience of her danger, he had  pursued every advantage, seized upon every opportunity of that unconventional  life, how he had hunted and waylaid her. He would have to be answered, and at  once. </p>
<p>She was long writing that answer, though  her letter was brief. The church clocks struck two before she had addressed and  sealed it. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The past is past,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;It was  more dreadful to me than you can ever know. I have only one favour to ask.  Forget me, as I have tried to forget you. I am going to marry a man whom I  dearly love, and I know that you are too honourable, and I hope you are too  kind, to come between me and that great happiness. Let the dead bury their  dead. I have never reproached you. I have never breathed your name to anyone belonging  to me. No one knows how cruel you were to a helpless girl. No one will ever  know from my lips. Perhaps you think it would be a kind of reparation if you  were to marry me; but believe me there is only one reparation in your power,  and that is to be a stranger to me for the rest of our lives.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was no signature. Her penmanship  would be sufficient evidence against her should he be wicked enough to show her  letter to anyone who knew her; but that was a depth of infamy of which she  could not suppose him capable. Reparation! That was what his letter meant.  Their marriage was to make everything happy; and that miserable past was to be  thought of as a fairy tale of girlish love, a memory of days that had been  sweet, to be dwelt upon in sentimental moments amidst the security of married  life. </p>
<p>This was the man she ought to marry, this  man whose coarse mind could conceive no shame in the remembrance of sin. She  was bound to him by that shameful past. He had the right to claim her. He was  the only man upon earth to whom she could go as a bride without dishonour. </p>
<p>She could realise this stern truth, and  yet reject his  offer, resolved to give herself only to the man she loved: her <em>preux  chevalier</em>, her Phcebus Apollo, radiant in the glory of enchanting  youth, frank, joyous, a creature made for happiness, made to be adored. She had  discovered a likeness in Conrad&rsquo;s clear-cut Greek features to the Belvedere  Apollo. He had the same outlook, his head had the same poise. And he loved her  with a passion as pure as it was strong, loved her with the love that sees  something of divinity in the chosen wife. </p>
<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock before she fell  asleep, and then sleep was worse than waking, for Henry Middlemore&rsquo;s image was  mixed with the trouble of her dreams. </p>
<p>When the maid brought the morning tea she  sent her to Lady Thelliston to say that she had a bad headache and would not  leave her room till after church-time. </p>
<p>She would get up at about eleven o&rsquo;clock,  she told the maid, and would want no help in dressing, after her clothes were  put out; the white <em>crepe</em> frock, the  pansy toque, and so forth. If Mr. Harling called, he was to be told she would  be in the drawing-room at a quarter to one ready to go for a walk. And then she  drank her tea, and lay down again, trying to compose herself, trying to bring  the colour back to her pallid cheeks, the brightness to her haggard eyes. She  badly wanted to sleep, she longed to sink into the gulf of oblivion, the  darkness where memory and pain are not. </p>
<p>That deep oblivion would not come at her  bidding, only fitful snatches of slumber, with intervals of restlessness,  fretful movements, rebellion against fate. Had she not suffered enough? Had she  not a right to be happy after those quenching fires, that heavy price paid for  sin? Duty! Truth! Honour! Those were mere words when weighed in the balance  against happiness and love. She knew that, if she kept her secret, she could  make Conrad happy. She knew that to tell him the story of her fall would be to  make him miserable, perhaps to plunge him again into the darkness of that  living death of the lunatic asylum, he whose exuberant nature was made for the  glory of life, made to be happy and to diffuse gladness. </p>
<p>Conrad&rsquo;s card was lying on the hall-table  when she went downstairs at twelve o&rsquo;clock, and crept out of the house to post  her letter. A messenger was of course impossible. The man must wait till Monday  morning for her answer. </p>
<p>He would be angry no doubt, surprised and  indignant at her refusal, but she did not think he would try to injure her. </p>
<p>There was a pillar-post a few doors off,  and her absence had lasted less than five minutes. The footman looked surprised  when he opened the door for her, no one having heard her go out. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harling called at nine o&rsquo;clock to  inquire for you, ma&rsquo;am. Brixham gave him your message, and he said he would be  here soon after twelve.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She had only been just in time with her  letter. Conrad appeared before she had been in the drawing-room five minutes,  enchanted to find her waiting for him, ready for their Sunday-morning walk,  full of solicitude about her health, needing to be assured that she had quite  recovered from the headache that his folly had caused. </p>
<p>They went to Hamilton Gardens, Conrad  rejoicing in the little bit of solitude they might have before people came out  of church, Irene&rsquo;s share of the conversation being performed very feebly. She  had seen Henry Middlemore on the other side of the way as they crossed Hill  Street, and she thought that he might be going to the house to make some  inquiry about her, after being disappointed of a letter in the morning. Oh, the  horror of it all, if he were going to dog her footsteps, to haunt her, to hunt  her down! She had tried to believe it was impossible that he should persecute  her, that he must have some generous feeling, some touch of remorse that would  induce him to spare her, when once he realised that her love was dead, that  another and a better love had come into its place. He knew nothing yet, and no  doubt was acting upon the presumption that she still loved him, and would forgive  everything for love&rsquo;s sake. </p>
<p>And then there was something else that he  did not know; the slow fire of shame, the shame that had burnt into her heart  and brain, and had killed love. </p>
<p>She was glad when the gate closed behind  them, and they were walking in the exclusive Eden, where the few could escape  from the many. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk of something very  serious,&rdquo; Conrad said, and seeing her sudden, scared look: &ldquo;My dearest, don&rsquo;t  be frightened. It isn&rsquo;t anything gloomy or horrid. I want you to fix our wedding  day. We are always talking about it as coming soon, and I know your frocks are  being made, but we have been vague so far. Let it be soon, love, very soon!&rdquo; </p>
<p>They were alone in the shelter of the  trees, and he could even venture to slip his arm through hers, and draw her a  little nearer to him, his ear on the alert for approaching footsteps. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall it be, love?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You must settle that with my stepmother.  I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll want to make a fuss and invite people &mdash;my father&rsquo;s  friends&mdash;most of them soldiers. Let it be as soon as she likes. I want to belong  to you, Conrad. I want to be sure that we are bound to each other for life.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He was enraptured at her speech, the most  direct avowal of love he had ever had from her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My sweet girl, you have filled my cup of  bliss. I&rsquo;ll talk to Lady Thelliston after lunch. She can order the invitation  cards to-morrow morning. They ought to be ready in twenty-four hours; and a  fortnight&rsquo;s invitation will be enough.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Wedding invitations are generally much  longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only to give people time to buy  presents. We don&rsquo;t want candlesticks or paper-knives, do we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I want? You have loaded me with  lovely things.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing half lovely enough. The jewellers  have no new ideas. They can only offer one something that they made last week  for a duchess or a countess. They have no new departures. One must go to Italy  for an idea.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>They walked in the gardens till half-past  one, no longer in blissful solitude, but meeting people they knew every five  minutes. They were on the way back to Chapel Street, when in the little street  by Dorchester House they came into a group of people, and stopped to talk, and  while Conrad was monopolised by a loquacious dowager, Irene found Henry  Middlemore at her side. She had not seen him coming, did not know where he had  sprung from. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t forgotten me, Miss  Thelliston,&rdquo; he. said, offering his hand, and then he went on in a much lower  voice: &ldquo;No letter! If you knew how I am devoured by impatience!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I posted my answer an hour ago.&rsquo;&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Cruel! I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get it till to-morrow.  An eternity!&rdquo; </p>
<p>People were talking all round her, yet she  was in an agony lest Conrad should hear. She broke in upon the dowager&rsquo;s  discourse. &lsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be very late for luncheon,&rdquo; she  said. </p>
<p>Middlemore lifted his hat and went away,  but those few words, his persistence in talking to her when she was among  people, had given her an agony of fear. The chattering group dispersed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no escape from that woman,&rdquo;  Conrad said. &ldquo;That was the man we met yesterday, wasn&rsquo;t it? The man whose horse  won?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What a presuming cad to talk to you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She did not answer him. She walked by his  side in dull silence. Middlemore&rsquo;s persistence filled her with dread. He had  waited for her while she was in the gardens, watched and followed her when she  came out. Despair came upon her suddenly as she realised her peril. A word, a  look, from this man might awaken Conrad&rsquo;s suspicions. He would question her,  drive her to distraction, force her to prevaricate and to lie; and doubt once awakened,  the fierce suspicion of jealous love, he would not rest till he had dragged her  secret from her, would not be appeased till the veil was rent from that  disgraceful story, and he knew her for the thing she was. </p>
<p>And then to be thrown off and abandoned,  to see the warm fond lover turned into a man of stone, cruel to himself as to  her, inflexible even in his despair. She had learnt to know his way of  thinking, all his opinions, prejudices, beliefs; and she knew that an un-virtuous  woman was hateful in his eyes. She had watched his countenance when improper  people had been discussed in his presence, lightly, with a smoothing over of  hard facts, and she knew that in his mind there was no indulgence for sin. His  chivalrous ideas about women were allied with a severity as of the seventeenth  century Puritans. </p>
<p>She hardly knew how she lived through the  rest of the day. She dined at home, and went with Lady Thelliston to a rather  prim evening-party where she was to meet Conrad and his mother. </p>
<p>She tried to avoid Lady Mary, feeling that  those keen clear eyes would read her trouble, might even divine the cause, and  know that her first lover had come back into her life. </p>
<p>She heard two men talking of him as the  owner of yesterday&rsquo;s winner. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half a bad fellow&mdash;very popular in his  own part of the country&mdash;an invalid wife&mdash;died at Cannes last winter. They want  him to take the hounds next season&mdash;plenty of money.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And then the conversation changed and she  heard no more of him. </p>
<p>It was a dull party, though there were  three or four well-known politicians and more than one artistic and literary  celebrity in the little crowd. There was no music, and by a quarter-past eleven  everybody had gone on, or had gone home. Conrad had hardly left Irene&rsquo;s side,  and she had tried to talk lightly and to seem gay. He told her of his  satisfactory conversation with her stepmother. The wedding invitations were to  be ordered next morning, and sent out on Wednesday&mdash;a ten days&rsquo; invitation. </p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you have only to make up your  mind about the honeymoon. Where shall we go? To what secluded nook in  Switzerland&mdash;or on the Italian side of Montblanc, and then down into Italy, to  Locano, Baveno, Stresa. To be together and alone in that divine country! Think  what bliss!&rdquo; </p>
<p>All this was spoken in confidential tones  while they sat under an awning on the balcony in a thicket of palms. </p>
<p>He was radiant with the assurance of  happiness, expectant of a life without a cloud. He asked about the bridesmaids.  Had she chosen them, and how many? Daisy, of course, must be one of them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My stepmother insisted upon six  bridesmaids &mdash; girls whose mothers were her bridesmaids. She knows crowds of  people. I know she has asked your cousin, and Miss Meredith has kindly  consented to be one of the six. My father and I would have liked a quiet  wedding &mdash;just one bridesmaid&mdash;but I suppose Lady Mary would think that kind of  thing rather discreditable.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I daresay she will approve of Lady  Thelliston&rsquo;s plans. She will like a little fuss. But if I could marry you  to-morrow morning in the quietest church in London&mdash;some dear old City  church&mdash;St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Holborn, for instance, and whisk you off to Lucerne in the  Engadine Express, I should think myself the most blessed of men.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She sat by his side in silence, with a  heart of ice, remembering how that other man had pleaded for a quiet wedding,  and a swift flight to fairer scenes, to that unutterably beautiful world, the  valley girt round with snow-mountains where they had met and loved and parted. </p>
<p>She let her hand lie in Conrad&rsquo;s, and he  bent down and kissed it in the shadow of the palms. The beautiful head with the  short crisp brown hair bent down to worship her, and while he worshipped there  was another man claiming her as if by an indefeasible right. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>She rode in the Park with her father and  Conrad next morning, rejoicing in her Arab&rsquo;s freshness and the gallop that  brought the colour back to her cheeks. Between Stanhope Gate and the Row she  had time to think what an escape it would be if she could bring about an  accident, make her horse bolt with her and break his neck and hers over the  railings. She remembered a favourite novel in which she had read of such a  catastrophe, and how in the story sudden death had solved a problem, as it  might solve the problem of her life. If she were killed that morning Conrad  would never know. </p>
<p>His mother would not break her oath. Lady  Mary would be content to know that he was released from the bond she hated; and  Death would cancel Henry Middlemore&rsquo;s claim. </p>
<p>Conrad reproached her for riding wildly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ride with such a loose rein I  shall be afraid to let you ride to hounds,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>He had talked to her of the hunting next  year, and that he might take the hounds perhaps, by-and-by. They were to winter  in Egypt; but there might be a chance of some good sport in March, when they  went home. </p>
<p>Home! The word had been sweet in her ears;  but now there was the blackness of impenetrable night round her, dread, and  almost despair. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>There was a letter lying on the hall-table  when she went in, exactly like the last, a conspicuous letter with a big  vermilion seal, delivered by hand. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your correspondent?&rdquo; her father  asked sharply, as she took up the letter. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing of importance.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a bill?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only a circular.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She ran upstairs before he could ask any  more questions, and shut herself in her room. </p>
<p>Her frock was laid out on the bed, and  Justine would be engaged with Lady Thelliston for the next two hours. She was  safe in her seclusion till eleven o&rsquo;clock, when Daisy was to call for her, and  they were to go together to the people who were making her trousseau, and who  had to be kept up to time. </p>
<p>This was the letter she had to read, she  who ardently desired to know herself bound to Conrad Harling through life and  till death. Within less than a fortnight of the day appointed for her wedding  she had to read this letter and consider all that it meant: </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Your letter, just to hand, is a  thunderbolt. I suppose I had no right to expect that you would remain free; and  indeed when we parted, when I left you with an aching heart to fulfil an  engagement from which I saw no escape, I told myself that I hoped you would  meet with someone better worthy of your love, that you would make a happy  marriage, and that all we had been to each other would seem to you no more than  the memory of a dream. Could I think otherwise in that dark day when I was  leaving you, as I thought, for ever, to keep faith with the woman to whom I had  bound myself before I had ever seen your love-compelling face. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;But now that there is no barrier to our  happiness, now that the one desire of my heart and mind is to call you wife, it  seems to me impossible that any other man can stand between us. Remember what  you have been to me, and ask yourself if you can refuse to be mine, now that  Providence has put it in our power to cancel all that was unfortunate in the  past by the most solemn, the most sacred of bonds. Can you for an instant  contemplate giving yourself to another man while I am here to remind you of my  claim, I who am the only man living who has any-right over you? What power of  choice can you have in such circumstances? Can I believe that you will call  another man husband and deny yourself to me, whose overmastering passion  brought shipwreck upon us both, when you were a child in ignorance of evil, a  woman only in the power to love. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, my divine girl, think of those days,  think of all we were to each other, my Haidee, so lovely and so innocent. I was  a wretch to hazard the sweet enchantment of those hours, a wretch not to fly  temptation, not to leave you while you could still remember me without pain.  But if I made you unhappy then I can give you a life of devotion in atonement  for my sin. Do not try to cheat me. Do not imagine that I will forego my right  to make you my wife, without needless delay. In the face of your letter, I  shall not rest till you are legally mine. I shall apply for the special license  to-day, and shall leave this hotel and take rooms in your parish. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Yours and yours only till death us do  part, </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;H. M&rdquo; </p>
<p>All the more determined phrases were heavily  underscored. From the first words to the last the letter was a menace. She  remembered the tyranny of his love in the days when she had loved him. She was  then at the age when a girl adores a tyrant. His determined pursuit of her had  been the charm that worked to such fatal issues. To be pursued, to be  worshipped! It was the school-girl&rsquo;s dream of bliss. But now, with this letter  in her hand, remembering what he had been, a deadly fear took hold of her. He  had been her master then, when she loved him. He was her master now, when she  hated him. How could she have hoped that he would be generous, that he would  stand out of her way and let her take her own road to happiness? </p>
<p>How could she have hoped that pity, or  honour, would seal his lips, when he wanted to marry her? Self was his god and  his law. She knew that now, recalling details remembered though not understood  in those foolish hours, before she had acquired wisdom in the school of misery. </p>
<p>He would have no mercy. </p>
<p>What could she do? She dared not defy him.  She had told him that love was dead, and he had ignored that plea. He wanted  her. He would make her his bond slave, and would laugh at the power of a rival.  He would make her marry him. There was the sickening dread that froze her. She  saw herself at his mercy. If she persisted in refusing him he would fight for  her with the most odious weapons, would tell her lover all that the cruellest  speech could tell of her sin-stained girlhood. She would stand before her<em> preux  chevalier</em>, the man who worshipped her, a lost creature. </p>
<p>She had told Lady Mary that Conrad would  cleave to her, even if he heard her story. The disillusion might go near to  break his heart, but he would not forsake her. He would take her, degraded,  humiliated, changed utterly from the goddess he had worshipped, and would  pardon and pity her. But love and life would be changed; and she told herself  that she could not live under the burden of his pity, she could not live with  him and be happy, conscious of the change in his feelings. Better&mdash;better  anything&mdash;than to be <em>his</em> wife,  knowing that she had forfeited his respect, that he was sorry for her, and  sorry for himself as her husband. </p>
<p>What was she  to do? She had no hour in the day that she could call her own, no power to go  the length of Chapel Street without accounting for her moments. Her stepmother  was too self-absorbed to be formidable; but she had an idea that her father  suspected her, that those cold cruel eyes followed and watched her. He had  looked at her keenly when he questioned her about that dreadful letter &mdash; so  obviously <em>not</em> a tradesman&rsquo;s circular. </p>
<p>She was like a hunted stag at bay, the cry  of the pack gaining on her. She had no time to think, no time to map out her  course. An imperative message had come from her father before she had taken off  her riding clothes; he was at breakfast and wanted to see her. It was her  daily task to pour out his coffee, and to pretend they were on excellent terms,  a model father and daughter. He was a man who loved shams. </p>
<p>At eleven Daisy came for her in Lady  Mary&rsquo;s victoria, and she was driven to Dover Street to spend a weary hour  trying on garments of every description&mdash;her wedding dress &mdash; her clothes for  Italy &mdash; and her clothes for Egypt. Conrad was pacing the street, waiting for  them to come out and join him, and then they were to go and walk in the Park by  the sumptuous flower-beds, while the driving people and the riding people and  the walking people went by them like figures in a cinematograph. To Irene on  that miserable day nothing in the world seemed real except her own despair. A  few yards from the Stanhope Gate she saw Henry Middlemore standing with his  back to the railings watching them. She looked straight before her, and went on  talking to Daisy, pretending not to see him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That man haunts us,&rdquo; Conrad said, when  they had passed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner of Horoscope. Didn&rsquo;t you see  him?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She managed to post a letter to Middlemore  that afternoon &mdash; hiding it between other letters and dropping it into a pillar  box before Conrad&rsquo;s eyes, as they walked through Esher, where the Mercedes had  carried them to take tea in an inn garden, Daisy and Professor Wilmer for their  companions, the Professor attaching himself to Daisy in a dull persistent way,  like a learned barnacle. He was never weary of expounding his views about the  universe for her edification, and he had told her incidentally that he would  like to marry her. </p>
<p>Conrad was to dine in Chapel Street, and  to meet his betrothed at two dances. </p>
<p>Her letter to Middlemore was brief: </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;If you will walk in the Park, by the  flower-beds, between Stanhope and Grosvenor Gate, to-morrow morning at  half-past six, I will try to join you for a quarter of an hour. There is no use  in any more letter-writing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That was all; no signature, no address. </p>
<p>Such an appointment was a desperate thing;  but she thought it would be safe at that early hour. No servant would come  downstairs before seven, and she would only have to unbolt the street door and  go out. Her father came down at eight for his morning ride. She could be back  at the house at a quarter-past seven, in time to put on her habit. The servants  could do no more than wonder. They might think she had gone out for an early  walk with her <em>fianc&eacute;</em>. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>The second and more delightful of the two  dances did not begin to languish till after three o&rsquo;clock, when Lady Thelliston  declared herself absolutely worn out, a fact confirmed by the damaged state of  her complexion, and insisted on carrying off her stepdaughter, in spite of  Conrad&rsquo;s petition for one more &ldquo;extra.&rdquo; Irene had been paramount in beauty,  crowned with the factitious interest of approaching nuptials, all other girls  curious about her, and most of them inclined to depreciate her charms, and to  consider Mr. Harling much too good for her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt she was very pretty, in a  certain style of her own&mdash;rather like Lady Hamilton in Romney&rsquo;s pictures; and,  well, everybody knew what kind of person his famous sitter was. Quite a Romney  beauty! And she had dropped from the skies last June. She had no connexions  about the Court. The King had asked who she was in a tone that implied a great  deal. She had not even been presented on this side of the Irish Channel. She  was going to be after her marriage. The father was a soldier, but no one had  heard of him till that West African affair the other day. The mother&mdash;or  stepmother&mdash;was too odious for words. In point of fact, they had no connexions  whatever, that anybody knew of. They were quite new people, and they were  living in a squeezy little house in Chapel Street, quite impossible for entertaining.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In such phrases did the faded and the  partner-less express their poor opinion of Irene and her people. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>The sky was sunless and grey, and there  was a chilliness in the air when Irene stole out of the house soon after six  o&rsquo;clock to keep her appointment with Middlemore. Her endeavour to sleep in the  daylight and amidst the sound of awakening birds and early traffic had been  vain. Two and a half hours of restlessness had made her more tired than when  she left the dance, and she had that strange vague feeling of not being more  than half alive which comes from sleepless nights and the strain of hidden  trouble. From Saturday afternoon till Tuesday morning her brain had been  working at an eighty horse-power, not an hour&rsquo;s natural sleep, not a minute&rsquo;s respite  from torturing thoughts in her waking hours, not even when she was waltzing  with her lover in the flower-scented ball-room, gliding round in an elysium of  music and light, his strong arm encircling her, his kind eyes watching her face  with ineffable love. No, there had been no pause in the torment of the  labouring brain. What was she to do? Was there any hope, any way of escape from  the doom she loathed: to part from the man she loved, to give herself to the  man she hated? </p>
<p>Now in the  chill grey morning, past the awakening flowers, she was hurrying to meet the  hated lover, to fight her last battle for freedom, and make her last appeal to  the tyrant. The cool air revived her, and that dream-like feeling of not being  quite conscious of existence, which amounted almost to the loss of identity,  left her in the freshness of the morning. </p>
<p>It was not a quarter past six when she  went into the Park, but Middlemore was there before her, a few yards from  Grosvenor Gate. She saw the tall figure, broad and stalwart, coming towards  her with a swinging step, on the solitary path. There was no one else within  sight. They had the Park to themselves. </p>
<p>He almost ran to meet her, and before she  could speak he was holding her in his arms, and his kisses were on her face,  the kisses of love that will not be denied. She gave a cry of despair, and  struggled to escape, but the strong arms held her close. She felt like some  wild thing that had fallen into a trap. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My angel, how sweet of you to come,&rdquo; he  said, with his lips on her face. </p>
<p>She went on struggling impotently. Her  cheeks, that had been white when she met him, were flaming with angry fire. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know  how I hate you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, if you hated me you would not  have come. No, no, it is love that brings my Haidee to my arms.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He saw people coming&mdash;a sauntering  policeman &mdash;a groom exercising a horse, and released her from that fierce  embrace, and slipped his arm through hers, and led her across the road to the  turf under the trees, where they might walk unseen. She was trembling  violently, and the weakness of strained nerves made her helpless. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me sit down, or I shall faint,&rdquo; she  said, and he took her to a bench and seated her by his side, with his arm round  her. He took off her hat and made her rest her head against his shoulder, and  held her as a man holds a woman who is his own. There was a rough tenderness in  all he did, a tenderness that had been enchanting in the old days, when the  glamour of unknown love held her spell-bound and at his mercy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to you to tell you that I mean to  marry Conrad Harling,&rdquo; she said, when she could command her voice. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while I live&mdash;not while I live. You  are my wife in the sight of God. You must wait till you are my widow if you  want to marry any other man.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not your wife. I owe you  nothing. You have not the shadow of a right over me. You left me to my misery,  to my shame.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She burst into tears, and hid her face in  her hands, sobbing violently. The loosely rolled-up hair fell over her neck and  shoulders. Middlemore sat for a minute in deep thought; then with extreme  tenderness, with hands that caressed the lovely tresses, he bound them into a  knot and gathered up the scattered combs and made her head look neat again. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke of shame,&rdquo; he said in a low  voice. &ldquo;What shame could there be&mdash;except in my sweet girl&rsquo;s tender conscience?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;There was shame &mdash; bitter shame &mdash; a year  of shame. It was a year after you forsook me&mdash;before I could go into the light  of day without shrinking from every eye&mdash;hating my fellow-creatures &mdash;a year  before I left my sick bed&mdash;a wreck! Ah, if you had seen me then you would not  have wanted me. Such a wasted sickly creature would have no attraction for  you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He hardly heard what she said. He took her  to his breast again with irresistible force. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved girl&mdash;I never dreamt&mdash;I never for  a moment contemplated&mdash;Oh, what a brute I was! But you told me nothing&mdash;you never  hinted at your trouble. How could I think that you would have kept such a  secret? Our child! Oh, how I shall adore&mdash;how I shall worship my Haidee&rsquo;s child  &mdash;son or daughter! How divine a gift! Where&mdash; where have you hidden our child?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the grave,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He did not  live through the day.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My angel! My suffering angel! But we have  life before us; and we are going to be happy. And could you think of marrying  another man&mdash; you, the mother of my son? It was a shameful thought.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was a change in his accent, as he  spoke those words, a change to absolute severity. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a shameful thought.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That was this man&rsquo;s opinion; and how about  the other man whom she adored &mdash; her <em>preux chevalier?</em> If she could  defy Middlemore and marry Conrad Harling, might not the day come when he would  tell her that it was a shameful thought, a shameful act that had given her to  his arms? Would love excuse her? Would beauty win his pardon, beauty disfigured  by sin? </p>
<p>No, she could not marry Conrad. She could  not face the possibility of his anger, his grief, his killing contempt. </p>
<p>Perhaps she had known from the moment when  Henry Middlemore took her in his arms that the battle was lost. </p>
<p>She had come into the cool grey morning,  braced with angry resolution, prepared to fight a desperate battle, determined  to win. But he had given her no chance of fighting. She was his prey. He had  taken possession of her. He had held it unquestionable that she must be his.  The old tyranny subjugated her, something there might be perhaps of the old  magnetism, when the lightest touch of that strong hand, trembling as it stirred  the lilies upon her breast, had thrilled her with girlhood&rsquo;s unquestioning  love. </p>
<p>She knew that the battle was lost. After  her passion of sobs she sat looking straight before her, with tearless eyes,  conquered&mdash;despairing. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you would be sorry if I were to  kill myself,&rdquo; she said at last, in a low toneless voice. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; you will not kill yourself. You  bore that year of martyrdom, my poor dove. Why should you want to die now when  you have a happy life before you? You think you are in love with this Harling  fellow, but that&rsquo;s skittles! He is younger than I am, altogether more  attractive, I daresay; but I am the man you loved when first your heart knew  what love meant. I am the man you will love till your dying day.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She made no fight. She sat mute and  defeated, and let him dictate to her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We can be married at nine o&rsquo;clock  to-morrow morning. You have only to slip out of your house at half-past eight.  I shall be in the street watching for you. Don&rsquo;t trouble about bag or baggage.  I will get all you can want for a few weeks&mdash;and after that no doubt your people  will send your things. They may make a fuss at first; but when they find you  have married a man of good means they&rsquo;ll come round like a shot.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A clock struck seven. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go home,&rdquo; she said, putting on her  hat. </p>
<p>She did not look at him, or answer him.  She neither assented nor refused. She made no protest, except for a long  agonised sigh. She was beaten. </p>
<p>He walked with her till they were within  sight of the flowery balconies, holding her arm all the way. She felt his love  sustaining her, dominating her as in the past. She knew that it was real love  of its kind; violent, tyrannical, exacting, but real. She knew that he was  ready to fight for her, to do wild and desperate things rather than let her go. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>A housemaid opened the door and stared at  her in blank surprise. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been walking in the Park to cure  my headache,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Tell Clarkson to let the groom know that my horse  won&rsquo;t be wanted, and he can tell Sir Michael that I am not going to ride this  morning.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She flung herself upon the bed, beaten,  beaten! She felt as if the beating had been not only moral but physical. Heart  and limbs were aching. She wanted to lie upon the ground, face downwards, and  never get up again. Middlemore had trodden her into the dust. </p>
<p>She did not  leave her room that day. She refused to see Conrad. She sent him a line in  pencil to tell him she was tired to death after the ball, and must take a day&rsquo;s  rest. He rushed off to an eminent nerve-doctor who lived within a stone&rsquo;s-throw,  and gave himself no peace till that authority had seen the beloved patient, and  could assure him that there was nothing seriously amiss, only nervous  prostration, requiring seclusion and repose. An affair of a day or two. </p>
<p>That was all; but for Conrad the world was  empty. He hardly knew how to get. through the day. His only relief was in  talking to Daisy about the wedding&mdash;asking trivial questions about the frocks,  about the bridesmaids, about the bride&rsquo;s luggage. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go and look at her trunks?&rdquo; he  asked, as if proposing a treat, and he straightway carried the submissive Daisy  to the trunk-makers, where he gloated over the great dress-box, the hat-boxes  and bags, the cabin trunk for the voyage to Alexandria. They were to be  finished off in a hurry, with her initials I. H., and a four-leaved shamrock by  way of badge on sides and lid. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Thelliston is to find her a good  maid,&rdquo; said Conrad. &ldquo;The poor darling has had only a half share in her  stepmother&rsquo;s slavey up to now.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging by Lady Thelliston&rsquo;s complexion  it would be more like a sixteenth,&rdquo; said Daisy. </p>
<p>Conrad rode with the General next morning.  Irene was under the doctor&rsquo;s orders to keep her room. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been doing too much,&rdquo; Sir Michael  said. &ldquo;Girls are simply insatiable. My poor wife is worn out. I heard them come  in on Monday night, I should say Tuesday morning, a few minutes to four.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Conrad talked of Irene all the time. Would  Sir Michael send her Arab to Cranford, where the stud groom would take  particular care of him, in a loose box, with his shoes off, till the spring,  when they came home from Egypt. She should have her Arabs there, and revel in  the desert rides, the delicious mornings, the charm and wonder of that land of  strange gods. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious to think how we humdrum English  have taken possession of it after all these centuries,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and how we  carry all our paltry modern luxuries, our fine clothes and snobbism, to the  land that was old when Herodotus wrote about it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He breakfasted with his mother and Daisy.  He was restless and yet dull, as if that severance of twenty-four hours had  been too much for his nerves. Lady Mary watched him anxiously. She felt as if  there were thunder in the air. She had noted the change in Irene&rsquo;s manner on  Sunday. And now the girl&rsquo;s nervous breakdown puzzled her, while the hurrying on  of the wedding was a blow. It killed the remnant of hope, that slowly dwindling  hope she had cherished from the beginning of Conrad&rsquo;s engagement, the hope that  something would happen, and that her son would be saved from that unholy union. </p>
<p>She had submitted to the inevitable. She  had been tolerant, and had put on a show of kindness in her intercourse with  Irene; but the memory of that night on board the <em>Electra</em>, the shock of  the girl&rsquo;s confession, had never been out of her mind since the hour she knew  this girl was to be her son&rsquo;s wife. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
<p>Conrad had called in Chapel Street before  breakfast, carrying a tribute of hot-house flowers for Irene, with an  eight-page letter written after midnight. He told his mother of this visit  while they were at breakfast. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t leave her room till the doctor  has seen her,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I know she&rsquo;d like to see you, Daisy, if you will  go and look her up.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want me to tell you how she  looks, and what she says. If she is quite a wreck after being a day under the  weather; if she has cried herself blind at being parted from you,&rdquo; Daisy said,  laughing at him, full of kindness, resigned to the certainty that he was to  pass out of <em>her</em> life altogether in a few days. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her I shall call before lunch to  hear what the doctor has said, and if I may take her into the country in the  afternoon. We might go to Brighton, and give her a breath of sea air, and be  back by nine o&rsquo;clock for dinner.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He went off to his den at the back of the  house, carrying the <em>Times</em> with him,  and totally incapable of reading it. </p>
<p>They had sat at breakfast longer than  usual, and it was ten o&rsquo;clock when Lady Mary went to her morning-room. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go to Chapel Street before you  come for my letters,&rdquo; she told Daisy. &ldquo;There is nothing very important this  morning,&rdquo; whereupon Daisy went off meekly to put on her hat and to go and  worship at the shrine of the strange goddess. </p>
<p>She passed the Thellistons&rsquo; footman on the  way, walking towards Hertford Street, and the butler who opened the door had a  certain discomposure in his looks. </p>
<p>Miss Thelliston was not at home. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she is better, I hope,&rdquo; said Daisy,  &ldquo;if she has really gone out.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man assured her. Miss  Thelliston had gone out early, a few minutes after Sir Michael started for his  ride. </p>
<p>Daisy retraced her steps, wondering  greatly. </p>
<p>Conrad came out of his den and met her in  the hall. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Back already? They would not let you see  her?&rdquo; he asked excitedly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She was not at home.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at home? Nonsense!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The butler said so.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He snatched up his hat, and hurried out of  the house. </p>
<p>A letter had been taken to Lady Mary five  minutes before&mdash;a letter carried by the footman Daisy had met on her way to  Chapel Street. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Tuesday  night. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You have won, Lady Mary. I am beaten in  my battle for life and love; but not by you. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Fate has been too cruel. The man you know  of has come back to me, free to make me his wife, and he has compelled me to  marry him. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;There is no help for me. I have fought  hard, but he has conquered me. We are to be married early to-morrow morning. We  are to leave England to-morrow night. I go to him with a broken heart. I can  never love him, never respect him, never hope for happiness with him,  remembering what Conrad has been to me, my noble lover, my king of men. Ah, you  can never know how I have loved your son, or how happy I could have made him,  with an adoring wife&rsquo;s devotion,  obedience, unchanging fidelity, if fate had let  me. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I have had to succumb. If I were to  persist in refusing Henry Middlemore, some dreadful thing would happen. It is  best that I should be the sacrifice. I deserve nothing better. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I thought that he had gone out of my life  for ever, that he was no more to me than the memory of a bad dream. But I met  him at Sandown on Saturday, and from that hour I have had no peace. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You tried to shame me into giving up your  son, and you failed. Henry Middlemore has shamed me into marrying him; and your  son has escaped. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Will you break this news to him, and be  merciful to me, and keep the secret which you swore never to betray, on your  crucifix? I do not think you could ever look upon that sacred image without  dread if you were to break that oath. Never let him know of that dark stain  upon my life. Never let him know that he has been twice the dupe of a pretty  face. But, indeed, I hope at my worst I am better than the Innkeeper&rsquo;s  daughter, for, at least, I have loved him fondly and disinterestedly, and I  would have married him had he been a beggar, and would have been proud to call  him husband. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Have pity upon me now, Lady Mary, as you  had that night on the <em>Electra</em>, for I am in  as deep a pit of shame and sorrow. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Irene Thelliston.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary sat  staring into vacancy, with the girl&rsquo;s open letter on the table before her. He  had escaped. The union she had dreaded and loathed, the union of honour with  dishonour, was not to be. He had escaped this danger; but could she dare to be  glad, while that other and even worse peril threatened him? The peril of a mind  overthrown by a sudden, overwhelming grief. </p>
<p>She knew how he loved this girl. She had  seen the self-surrender, the total absorption of his whole being, in that young  love. She knew that from the night of the ball, from the hour when he had held  the lovely girl in his arms, from their first waltz, from their first  interchange of trivial talk, sitting among the palms and flowers in the half  light of a winter garden, he had existed only to adore her. Irene had become  his world, and there was nothing else worth living for. Restless, silent,  pre-occupied in her absence, he woke to radiant life when she appeared. The  light stereotyped amusements of each day had become Elysian joys. Only to be  with her had made the dull earth fairy-land. </p>
<p>And now he was to be told that his goddess  had been stolen from him&mdash;that the creature who was so soon to have been his  own, his own for life, had been taken from him for ever. </p>
<p>Would it mend matters to tell him that she  was worthless, that to marry her would have been a calamity? No; the revelation  would only give a sharper edge to his grief, the agony of knowing that he had  been fooled for the second time in his life. </p>
<p>He burst into the room while Lady Mary sat  looking at the tree-tops and the blue summer sky with unseeing eyes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, a letter has been brought to you&mdash;  Irene&rsquo;s letter. What does it mean? She is gone&mdash; no one knows where! It&rsquo;s  maddening! Give me her letter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He would have snatched the open letter  from under his mother&rsquo;s hand, but she spread her hand over it, holding it on  the table. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; you are not to read her letter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A despatch-box stood open on the table in  front of her. She threw the letter into it and put down the lid, which fastened  with a spring lock. Then turning to her son, she put her arms round his neck  and drew his face down against her own. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest son, be brave! Try to bear the  heaviest blow you have ever had. If you could know how I love you, how my life  is bound up in you, I think you would be brave for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where has she gone? Why? Why?&rdquo; </p>
<p>He was white to the lips, and his voice  was hoarse and dull. And then, to his mother&rsquo;s horror, he burst suddenly into a  laugh. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She was like the publican&rsquo;s daughter, I  suppose. There is someone she liked better&mdash;some great coarse brute who knew how  to master her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He remembered the man at Sandown, the man  who had talked to Irene at the corner of Stanhope Street on Sunday&mdash;the man he  had seen leaning against the Park rails on Monday morning. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone off with that fellow? That&rsquo;s  what&rsquo;s the matter. Can&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo; he cried furiously. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She was married early this morning&mdash;to Mr.  Middlemore. It is not a happy marriage, Conrad. You have more reason to pity  her than to blame her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity  her, yes, I must pity her, pity her for breaking my heart, for making me hate  the world I live in&mdash;and all human kind&mdash;except you. I&rsquo;ll make that one  exception, mother, though you did me the biggest wrong you could do when you brought  me into this vile world. This world of lovely faces and black hearts. Black,  black as Erebus. Oh, how I loved her! How I trusted in her love! And she was to  make me happy! That was the burden of her song: &lsquo;I mean to make you happy.&rsquo; And  she let me fix our wedding-day &mdash;last Sunday. She melted into my arms, and sighed,  and said it could not be too soon. At that moment she was as utterly mine as  wedded wife ever was. Mine by the beating of her heart, by the lips that  trembled as I kissed them. And she has married that coarse brute&mdash;a creature of  thews and sinews, a face flushed with high living. Do you say that they are  married&mdash;now, now, as we stand here?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;They were  married early this morning, and they are to leave England to-night. Conrad, my  idolised son, only tell me that you will show yourself a strong man&mdash;strong in  moral force&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that I will grin and  bear-it&mdash;take my licking a little better than I did before. Don&rsquo;t be frightened,  mother. I am not going back to Roehampton. She has killed the gladness of my  life; but I won&rsquo;t let her kill mind and memory&mdash;if I can help it. I won&rsquo;t bring  trouble upon you again &mdash;if I can help it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He went out of the room after these words,  and Lady Mary did not follow him. She must let him fight his own battle. He had  taken the blow a little better than she had hoped, but his ghastly pallor and  the strained look in his eyes had appalled her. The warning of the doctors was  ever present in her mind. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him be disappointed a second time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The disappointment had come, by no act of  hers; and he had to bear the blow, and live through the agony of it as best he  could. She knew that she could do nothing to help him. The maternal heart might  ache for him, but a mother&rsquo;s affection could not heal the wounds a fatal love  had made. All attempts at consolation would be but a repetition of phrases that  would fall upon the sensitive brain like the measured water-drops in the  torture chamber. </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9 </strong></h2>
<p>Conrad went straight  to Chapel Street, where he found Sir Michael Thelliston in the den behind the  dining-room, a place where he kept his boots and the scanty literature of the  establishment. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear Harling, I was just going to  Hertford Street&mdash;my dear, dear fellow!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know why she has done this  thing?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, I know no more&mdash;hardly  anything more&mdash;than you do yourself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you must. She must have been in  love with this man. She would not jilt me a fortnight before our wedding-day if  there were not some kind of tie between her and this man. She must have been in  love with him when they met in Cashmere&mdash;and then they lost sight of each other,  I suppose; and last Saturday he came back into her life, and whistled, as he would  have whistled for his dog&mdash;and she went after him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have cared for him, perhaps&mdash;in  Cashmere. I was not there with her. My niece told me that Irene was greatly  admired. She was not eighteen, just out of the school-room; but my niece said  she was turning heads; and this&mdash;this Middlemore was among her admirers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all you can tell me?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And her stepmother, does she know no more  than this?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows nothing. She is horribly upset,  as I am. I was proud of my girl&rsquo;s engagement to you, proud of such a  son-in-law. It is a diabolical stroke of fate. I know nothing of this man; he  may be the biggest brute in England.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she write to you?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a line to say that she was to be  married this morning at nine o&rsquo;clock, at St. Nectern&rsquo;s, to Henry Middlemore.  The letter was brought by a messenger, after ten o&rsquo;clock. I went round to the  church, but the doors were shut.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she has made her choice. I thought  she loved me; but it seems I am easily deceived. God knows I loved her.  Good-bye, Sir Michael. You have always been kind to me; but you can understand  that I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t care to see anyone belonging to her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I  can easily understand. You have been cruelly wronged. I am ashamed of her. I am  deeply distressed. There is a box in her room that is to be sent to you. She  has packed all your splendid presents in it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the presents! Do you think I want to  see those again?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But they must be restored to you. That is  unavoidable.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The General went with him to the hall  door, and wrung his hand at parting, and then went sighing back to his den. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool! Fool!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Thirty  thousand a year, and a man who was her slave.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He had found Middlemore&rsquo;s name in the red  book. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Middlemore, late Grenadier Guards,  D.L., J.P., of Danewood Park, York; Clubs, Reform, Turf.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Conrad went to St. Nectern&rsquo;s, and  unearthed a verger, who let him see the marriage register. There was the latest  entry, the commonplace statement of a commonplace fact. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Middlemore, widower.<br>
  Irene Thelliston, spinster.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The witnesses were John Jobling, verger,  and Sarah Blake, pew-opener. </p>
<p>He went to his club and he sat in the  reading-room all day, behind a newspaper, pretending to read. Anything was  better than to go back to Hertford Street, where his mother and Daisy would be  watching him, and pitying him, and thinking about him all day long. </p>
<p>He telegraphed to Lady Mary from the club  early in the afternoon . . . &ldquo;Dining at Arthur&rsquo;s&mdash;may be late. Don&rsquo;t sit up for  me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And having done this he curled himself up  in a big armchair, in an obscure corner, and pretended to sleep. Men went in  and out without noticing him. He did not even attempt to dine; but he had some  tea at seven o&rsquo;clock, and then walked to the station at Charing Cross to see  the last of the girl he was to have married. </p>
<p>If she was to leave England to-night it  would be by that train, he thought. He took a ticket for Dover, for the  privilege of being on the platform when the train started, and stood amidst the  confusion of anxious passengers and harried porters, waiting for the last look,  that look which he swore to himself should be the last. </p>
<p>There was the usual crowd for the boat  train, and the faces that passed him all seemed to wear the same expression,  hurried, eager, and yet with a certain look of pleased anticipation, as if  there were something revivifying in the mere fact of leaving one&rsquo;s country. It  was always the same look&mdash;till he saw her face, and that was different. </p>
<p>Her husband was walking close beside her,  holding her arm, hurrying her footsteps, talking to her, flushed, eager,  exultant, like a man who has just won some great stake, and who can scarcely  contain himself for joy. </p>
<p>She was dressed in black, an alpaca skirt  and coat, a black toque, rather shabby clothes that she had worn in Ireland.  Conrad had never before seen her in black, and the change was startling. </p>
<p>She was very pale, and she looked years  older. Her face was drawn with mental pain and her eyes looked straight before  her. Conrad had never seen despair in a face till to-night. He took a step  forward unconsciously, with outstretched arms, as if to snatch her from her  doom. The sudden movement was unseen in the crowd. A porter opened the door of  a compartment labelled &ldquo;Engaged,&rdquo; and Middlemore lifted his bride into the  carriage. A servant came to the door and handed in travelling bag, rug and  sticks; and then went with the porter to see the luggage bestowed. &ldquo;These two  boxes for Dover, those three for Paris.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Conrad saw the new boxes, small and neat,  which had evidently been bought for the bride. The bride! She who was to have  been his bride. Who was to have journeyed with him over that joyous route, over  the dancing sea, to lands that were lovely and strange. </p>
<p>He saw the pale, grief-stricken face till  the last moment, till the train moved, and she was gone. </p>
<p>Why had she done this thing? What motive  could there have been for such cruel treason, if its only issue was despair? By  what spell had this man held her? The mystery of it all was maddening. </p>
<p>He left the station, and walked through  the streets like a man in a dream, till he found himself somehow in St. James&rsquo;s  Park. It was dark by that time, the thin darkness of summer, and the stars were  shining. He walked slowly, lost in thought, in despairing wonder. Why had she  done this thing? The face he had seen was not the face of a bride, but the face  of a victim. So might Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter have looked&mdash;wantonly sacrificed to a  father&rsquo;s irrational vow. </p>
<p>He walked by the Green Park to Hyde Park,  and across the sunburnt grass to Kensington Gardens. It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock  when he found himself at the north-western extremity of the gardens, facing the  railings, and watching the traffic in the Bayswater Road, watching with eyes  that saw passing waggons and omnibuses, carts and carriages, as strange things,  meaningless, a procession of phantoms. </p>
<p>He took hold of the railings with his bare  hands clutching the iron bars with strained fingers, as if to bring himself  back to conscious life by that painful contact of sharp-edged iron against  sensitive flesh. Since he left the railway station he had been walking in a  semi-conscious state, as he had walked on that long journey from Abingdon to  Padstow; along what dusty roads, uphill and downhill, across what bleak commons  or rolling moorland, he had never known. The same loss of conscious identity  had come upon him, or if not the same, something that came too near that  perilous state. Memory was shaken. He had lost count of time. Where had he  been, what had he been doing, since he heard of Irene&rsquo;s marriage? Was it by  days, weeks, or months that the interval had to be measured? </p>
<p>&ldquo;This means Roehampton,&rdquo; he said to  himself, frowning. &ldquo;No, I will not go mad. Once is enough &mdash;once, for one false  woman&mdash;for one lovely wicked face&mdash;the face that lures to madness or to death.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He set himself to count the passing  vehicles, standing there for a long time, staring into the road, and watching  now an omnibus, now a cab, a smart tradesman&rsquo;s cart, a brougham with flashing  lamps, and then the rush of a motor, with great flaring eyes like an angry  dragon. He looked at them, and studied them deliberately, and named them to  himself. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t go mad.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He turned on his heel and walked back to  Park Lane. </p>
<p>A woman spoke to him in the shadow of the  trees. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor wretch,&rdquo; he cried, giving  her a handful of gold, &ldquo;you never used any man as badly as I have been used,&rdquo;  and passed on with quickened pace, so that she could only stand gazing at his  receding figure, murmuring thanks that he could not hear.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<p>His mother came out of her room as he went  upstairs. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you sat up for me after all,&rdquo; he  exclaimed, &ldquo;in spite of my wire.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not rest till I knew you were at  home.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My best of mothers, don&rsquo;t worry yourself.  I am going to take this business quietly. I am used to it, you see.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He kissed her, and went up to his own  room. His quiet voice and manner gave her some slight comfort, but she lay  awake all night, with an aching heart, wondering what to-morrow would bring of  grief or terror. </p>
<p>Mother and son breakfasted <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em>, Daisy having  pretended a headache as an excuse for keeping out of their way. </p>
<p>Conrad was perfectly calm, with the  settled calmness of a man who is resolved to bear his burden, and who is strong  enough to bear it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear mother, you must not be anxious  about me,&rdquo; he said, looking up and surprising Lady Mary&rsquo;s watchful eyes, full  of sad solicitude. &ldquo;I have come to grief for the second time in my life&mdash; which  seems hard lines considering that I am not thirty&mdash;but I am not going to knock  under. Indeed, far from knocking under, I am going to make capital out of my  misfortune. Those African travels of mine&mdash;the Zambesi, Tanganyika &mdash;Nyassa. I am  going to make that fairy-tale a true story.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to go to Africa?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it better than going back to Roehampton?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dearest,&rdquo; she cried, bursting into  tears. He comforted her with sweet words, and even put on an air of gaiety. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear mother, a couple of years  knocking about in Central Africa is no more nowadays than the grand tour was  when Lord Chesterfield wrote those wonderful letters of his in the old house  hard by.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Lady Mary was fain to listen as he  reasoned with her, arguing that a blow such as he had suffered was not to be  got over by walking about the West End of London, or even mooning on the  Italian Lakes, or hunting in Hampshire. He had to do something that would call  upon his thews and sinews, and give his brain a holiday. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go alone, ma&rsquo;am, if it would fret  you. I know a splendid fellow who would go with me&mdash; and who knows the country.  I shall have to be pretty artful to prevent his finding out that I don&rsquo;t know  it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He went off directly after breakfast to  find his friend, and he set about his preparations for the journey with red-hot  haste. He contrived to be occupied every day and almost every hour, till that  sultry afternoon when he stood with his mother and Daisy Meredith in  Southampton Docks, bidding them good-bye, before he and his comrade went on  board the African steamer. </p>
<p>And then the women who loved him had to go  back to the desolate house in the land of conventionalities, where one day and  one year are painfully like every other day and year, and to harden their  hearts against the pain of years in which they were not to see him, years of  peril for him, years of constant anxiety for them. It had to be borne. Africa  was better than Roehampton. Perils from savages, perils from wild beasts, from  climate, from famine, were better than a mind extinguished, a death in life. </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>Conrad kept his word  to his mother, and in the second autumn after the parting at Southampton he was  settled at Cranford, and Daisy Meredith had her first ride after a pack that  belonged to her cousin, and in every individual whereof she could take a  personal interest. His African wanderings had been marred by few misfortunes. A  bout of fever, a camp-fire that consumed the travellers&rsquo; stores, and left them  in some danger of starvation, had been the worst incidents in travels that had extended  from the Zambesi to the Congo. He came back to England in vigorous health, and  he bore no outward signs of the disappointment that had changed the current of  his life. He took kindly to the humdrum existence of the country squire, and  rode hard, but not recklessly. He invited his friends to shoot with him over  woods that had been carefully preserved during his absence, and he was active  and cheerful, if not particularly joyous. </p>
<p>The freshness of youth and delight in  trivial things had gone from him for ever. He read more, and thought more,  spending solitary hours in his library. He interested himself in politics. He  was a kind and energetic landlord, and built cottages that were ideal in  healthfulness and comfort, aided in all his plans by Daisy&rsquo;s knowledge of  peasant life, its needs and idiosyncrasies. </p>
<p>He looked, and seemed in manner and ideas,  ten years older than in the brief summer of Irene&rsquo;s influence. When his mother  tried to arouse his ambition, and wanted him to offer himself for his division  of the county, he smiled, and begged her to be patient. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was seven years at Roehampton,&rdquo; he  said, and she understood the cryptic reply. </p>
<p>It would take him long to forget. The cure  had only begun in Africa. They would have to be patient, and bide their time. </p>
<p>Daisy was his right hand in most things on  the estate, on the home farm, in the stables and kennels. She had all the  instincts of a country-bred girl, though she had languished in a London suburb  till her eighteenth year. A daring rider, a fervid lover of the animal  creation, ardent in the chase but always sorry for the fox, she was never more  charming than at Cranford. And that knack of being never in the way and never  out of the way was itself a charm. </p>
<p>Lady Mary watched and wondered. Daisy was  eight-and-twenty, but quite as pretty at that mature age as she had been at eighteen,  prettier perhaps by the light of a developed intelligence that gave variety and  sparkle to the face. She was not a Romney beauty, or a Raphael beauty, nor had  she the sensuous lips and the dreaming violet eyes of a Rossetti beauty, but  she was pretty enough to be the sunshine of a good man&rsquo;s home, the smiling  welcomer at the end of a day&rsquo;s toil, the sympathising wife in trouble and in  joy. And she had bright and gracious manners that would ensure her popularity  as the wife of a public man. </p>
<p>Lady Mary  thought that, however long the courtship might hang fire, her son would end by  discovering that Daisy was something more to him than the adopted sister, the  useful friend, the good &ldquo;Pal&rdquo; he affected now to consider her; and as Daisy&rsquo;s  father had been obliging enough to die while Conrad was in Africa, there was  one obstacle the less to the marriage from a social point of view. </p>
<p>Of course, Daisy&rsquo;s mother was a  difficulty; but that poor lady, having failed as a singing mistress, as a  milliner, as a typewriter, as a crystal-gazer, and as a manicurist, would be  amenable to reason, and could be pensioned, and relegated to a modest villa at  Hastings or Ryde.</p>

<p>Conrad never uttered the name of his lost  love after his return from Africa; but he could not hope to go through life  without hearing of her, since Mr. Middlemore had crowned himself with glory by  winning the Derby with Yorkshire Tyke, a horse of his own breeding. After an  Indian honeymoon he had settled down in Yorkshire with his beautiful wife, who  shone as a star in a society made up of land-owners in the neighbourhood,  soldiers from York, and the men who came from afar for the big shoots. People  talked of her as lovely, but with cold and unattractive manners. As a  personality the jovial Middlemore was preferred to his beautiful wife. </p>
<p>They came to London for a short time in  the season, but had no London house. They stayed at one of the smart hotels,  and spent the greater part of their time at suburban race meetings and  fashionable cricket or polo matches. </p>
