<h1><strong>Melba&rsquo;s Gift  Book <br>
<font size="+1">Of Australian Art And Literature</font></strong></h1>
<p align="center" class="author"> <b>Editor: Franklin Peterson </b></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="AWordofExplanation"></a>A Word of  Explanation</strong></h2>
<p><em>Here is a personal reason for the  appearance of this book. I was born in Australia, and I glory in the land  of my birth. But as an artist I was born in Belgium. I made my debut there; my  first appearance in opera was at Brussels, and I can still hear the cheers of  my first audience, the kindly, warm-hearted Belgians whose generous recognition  of the unknown artist from distant Australia gave me hope and courage to  persevere.</em></p>
<p><em>For me, personally, the remembrance of  that night makes a link, that can never be broken, between my native homeland  and the country where my life as an artist had its beginning. To the Belgians,  who welcomed me long ago, Australia  was a land of fable; but they opened their hearts and took me in. Could an  artist&mdash;could a woman&mdash;ever forget such an experience?</em></p>
<p><em>All hearts are with the Belgians for  their heroism, and for their sufferings. My heart is with them, not only for  what they have done and for what they have endured, but because I lived among  them in their brighter, happier days, and because I learned to love them.</em></p>
<p><em>How charming the people of Belgium  were! Lovers of freedom, lovers of all the arts, lovers of beauty, lovers of  flowers, lovers of children. That is how I recall them. Honourable, public-spirited,  industrious, competent, inheriting the passion for independence that their  forefathers showed in the long struggle against all who tried to crush them.</em></p>
<p><em>Can we believe that the race that  withstood Alva, Louis Quatorze, and Napoleon will succumb to a greater tyrant  than any of them&mdash;but an infinitely smaller man? No, a nation made up of such  people cannot be blotted out.</em></p>
<p><em>I love every stone in Belgium; but now those stones are  trodden by invaders. And such invaders! One lies awake at night thinking of  what they have done, and wondering how one can help the victims who still  survive. What does the heart require of any nation that claims its sympathy?  That the men should be brave and tender, the women loving and true, and the  children frank and gay. That is what the Belgians were as I remember them, and  that is what they will be still, when all this dark cloud of misery has passed  away.</em></p>
<p><em>The Belgians are a finely artistic  people. In music, in painting, in sculpture, in architecture, in poetry, they  have produced masterpieces. The nation has a soul that loves what is beautiful  and what is true. That is why they love liberty.</em></p>
<p><em>To live nobly, and to die splendidly for  liberty&mdash;surely that is the greatest of all the arts. In that supreme art they  have shown themselves pre-eminent. We who are the spectators in the auditorium  can at least give them praise and thanks from the depths of our souls.</em></p>
<p><em>And that is the purpose of this  Australian book.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>By John Sandes</em></p>
<p align="center" class="note">[&ldquo;The  coming of the Spring in France.  . . &rdquo;&mdash;Daily Paper.]</p>
<p><em>The  flowers of the field, how your fragrance appealing,<br>
  Is lavished for largesse and poured without stint!<br>
  Afar, o&rsquo;er the sundering ocean, &rsquo;tis stealing;<br>
  And just through a word in a column of print.<br>
  Oh for sandals of swiftness, or carpet of story,<br>
  Or, fleeter than all, fancy&rsquo;s far-soaring wing,<br>
  To pass to those scenes that are gilded with glory<br>
  When dark days of Winter are banished by Spring.</em></p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p><em>I  see a green plain ....a few ruined white houses ....<br>
  A cottage unroofed, and a shell-riddled barn ....<br>
  A river that flows where placid herd browses<br>
  And is it the Wind that just whispers&mdash;&ldquo;The Marne!&rdquo;<br>
  The blue sky of France,  in those waters for omen<br>
  Reflected, prefigures the tranquil new day.<br>
  No trace is there left of the trampling of foemen,<br>
  For Springtide has wiped all the war-stains away.</em></p>
<p><em>From  the front in the North comes the roll of the thunder,<br>
  Where gun answers gun o&rsquo;er the barrier-flood,<br>
  And the soul and the body are stricken asunder;<br>
  But here, on this river, is peace&mdash;bought with blood.<br>
  Those long shallow trenches? O&rsquo;er terrors triumphant<br>
  Men digged them and died in them under the stars.<br>
  Their comrades leaped forward, victorious, exultant&mdash;<br>
  And the earth is o&rsquo;er-greened by the Healer of scars.</em></p>
<p><em>And  there on the slopes, where the prospect is spacious,<br>
  From sunshine and dew and the light showers shed<br>
  Spring weaves a soft coverlet, seemly and gracious,<br>
  And tenderly folds it o&rsquo;er each hero&rsquo;s bed.<br>
  And lest, in the turmoil that knows no cessation,<br>
  E&rsquo;en Love should be helpless to guide to the grave,<br>
  And the comrade should come not with last ministration,<br>
  God lays his own flowers on the tombs of the brave.</em></p>
<p><em>O flowers  of the field, I can see you at morning,<br>
  So dewy and dear at the earth-mother&rsquo;s breast;<br>
  The wild-rose, the snowdrop, the bluebell, adorning<br>
  The slopes where the children of Liberty  rest.<br>
  To the story of those who out yonder are sleeping<br>
  Each springtime returning new witness shall yield,<br>
  By the red, white, and blue of those petals out-peeping;<br>
  For courage, peace, hope, are the flowers of the Field. </em></p>
<p><em>And  hark to the skylark, at heaven&rsquo;s gate singing,<br>
  As once in the April of long, long ago.<br>
  While Earth has her springtimes that song shall come ringing&mdash;<br>
  A paean of praise for the heroes below.<br>
  And we, far away, listen wide-eyed and breathless;<br>
  No bird carols yonder, in France  o&rsquo;er the sea. </em></p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p><em>The  Spirit of Freedom, in song that is deathless,<br>
  Is welcoming homeward the souls of the free.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>By Ethel S. Turner  (Mrs. H. R. Curlewis).</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Which  leaves us,&rdquo; concluded the honorary auctioneer, in a depressed tone, &ldquo;with a  deficit of eleven and fourpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?  Eh?&rdquo; said the old man, who leaned forward, one hand to an ear, on one of the  seats at the back of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;sh,  Grandpa, people are looking at you,&rdquo; admonished the small girl who sat beside  him, but her face also wore a very troubled look. Indeed, a wave of depression  had washed over the entire room.</p>
<p>Here  was the second and concluding day of a fete in aid of the Belgian funds, and it  was in imminent danger of absolute failure.</p>
<p>The  weather was brilliant; there were matinees and football matches and the  races&mdash;scores, indeed, of other attractions. The suburb warmly wished the fete  success but left it for once to the other man, or to be more exact, the other  woman, to attend it in person.</p>
<p>The  result was that at six in the afternoon matters stood as the auctioneer so  sadly put it: when the hire of the hall, and the carpenters for erecting the  stalls had been paid, and lighting fees had been met, and the cost of the  ice-cream, not only would there be no cheque to send to the hard-pushed  Belgians, but there would be a deficit of eleven and fourpence. Also there  would be the bitterness of failure for the stall-holders who had worked so  hard.</p>
<p>A  deficit meant ineffaceable failure, positive disgrace for the stall-holders and  promoters. They stood or sat about the hall looking hurt, bewildered, even  angry: they were finding it hard to realise what was happening. The stalls, the  fruit of incessant toil for weeks, were excellently furnished; the programme of  events was even better than it had been for the fete of a fortnight ago, when  the promoters had netted a hundred pounds for the fund; the articles collected  for the auction were as valuable. Yet the fact remained that they were faced by  abject failure where the others had succeeded. It was the first time that the  suburb had been unanimous in assuming that the other man (or woman) would go.</p>
<p>The  auctioneer came down from the stage, the sparse audience dispersed, the workers  dispiritedly fortified themselves for the few remaining hours with cups of  doubtful tea and the sandwiches and scones for which there had been no demand  in the refreshment booth.</p>
<p>The  grandfather and the small girl started homeward hand in hand. The small girl&rsquo;s  mother, one of the disheartened stallholders, remained behind to guard her  unhonored fancy-work and be ready for business if such an unexpected person as  a buyer should happen along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  deficit,&rdquo; muttered the old man, incredulously. He knew how hard his  daughter-in-law had worked for the cause. But the small girl thought that he,  too, was puzzled by the unusual word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it means either, but I&rsquo;m sure it is something not  very nice. I think it must be another cushion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  grandfather explained the term with the punctilious care that his great age&mdash;he  was eighty&mdash;gave him time for.</p>
<p>Cathie  walked the length of an entire street while she digested the meaning of this.  And then her fast-moving little brain found a solution for the new problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  you what, Grandpa,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s the matter. People are just tired  of buying cushions. I know I am. What&rsquo;s the use of them? &rsquo;Cept for cats to sit  on. Oh-h-h!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  little brain had leapt ahead at lightning speed now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;  said the old man. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the child walked by his side in pregnant silence. Never a word all the way up  the long road, down the short side-street, and as far as the gate. She even  stooped and extracted the front-door key from under the mat,&mdash;that hiding-place  known to all day-burglars but still time-honoured&mdash;and spoke no word. But as  they stepped into the narrow hall and something soft and eager rubbed against  their legs she made her announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo;  she said firmly, &ldquo;when we go back to-night I&rsquo;m going to take my kitty to be  sold. Yes, so I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of  course he tried to dissuade her. At eighty, one remembers again quite clearly  the capacity of eight for the passion of pain. But she was adamant. The Mayor,  who had opened the fete, had pictured the woes of the land of deathless courage  in a flood of words that had washed straight to the heart of this child of  eight. There was nothing in the world that she felt she would not give or do  for Belgium.  But, unhappily, there seemed nothing within the power of eight-years-old to  either give or do.</p>
<p>Until  her little cat met her.</p>
<p>People  would not buy cushions any longer: well, she did not blame them. Cushions were  stupid, stuffy things&mdash;especially bazaar cushions, decorated to such an extent  that it was a heinous offence to cast one on the floor or carry it out on the  grass or dress it up as a baby.</p>
<p>But  a little cat with long smoky blue fur, a little cat, half Persian, even if half  &ldquo;just cat,&rdquo; a little cat with gentle, green eyes, &mdash;why the rush to acquire it  would be so great there would be bread for starving Belgium for days!</p>
<p>Nothing  would move her: she even persisted that the kitten would be glad to be sold if  it knew about Belgium.</p>
<p>So  the old man desisted in his attempt to dissuade her; he even exulted over the  sacrifice, in his heart. She was not a soldier&rsquo;s granddaughter for nothing.</p>
<p>And  then there came a sudden light into his faded blue eyes; he would not be  eclipsed in gallantry now any more than he had ever permitted himself to be,  when forty-three years ago he was fighting at Sedan. He, too, would sell the thing he cared  for most; he would sell the very gun with which he had fought.</p>
<p>He  had not always been conscious that it was the thing he cared for most; there  had been years in his wandering life when his thoughts had hardly gone to it  for a moment. But he had never parted with it: even when he flung off to Australia to earn the livelihood that, after the  war, it seemed impossible to earn in France, it was an integral part of  his luggage.</p>
<p>In  the peace that lapped him round, late in life, in the little home of his son  and daughter-in-law, it became again the object that stood for the backbone of  his life. It was his link with the past; it was even, he considered, a sort of  passport to the great Peace.</p>
<p>When  he grew fretful with himself because his poor old hands shook and his knees  trembled at exertion, he used to look at the gun where it stood in a corner of  his bedroom, and remind himself that at all events he had once been a man.</p>
<p>He  lifted the beloved &ldquo;flingot&rdquo; to him, this particular afternoon, as if it were a  thing alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought  to fetch a fine penny, eh?&rdquo; he said to the child.</p>
<p>But  Cathie was a very woman; self-sacrifice was all very well for her sex, but one  could not see a man denude himself like this without protest. Also at eight,  one could quite realise the capacity of eighty for the passion of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, Grandpa,&mdash;not your gun,&mdash;not your dear old gun. Anything else you like&mdash;how&rsquo;d  it be to give them your watch? &mdash;but not your Franco-Prussian gun.&rdquo; She tried  to take it from his hands by force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  giving your kitten, little one,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  but just <em>think</em> of your gun,&rdquo; said the  child. &ldquo;R&rsquo;mber that day you lay behind the grass bank with daisies on it, and  the enemy kept on shooting and shooting at you, and you kept sitting up and  shooting with it for five minutes and then tumbling down sideways and going to  sleep for five minutes, you were so tired after two days of it, and just as you  tumbled down once and started to snore, a bullet hit where your head would have  been if you hadn&rsquo;t been so sleepy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The  old man fondled his old &ldquo;tabatiere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  got back on them for it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The other fellows behind our bit of bank  had used up all their ammunition, but my bouts of going to sleep had saved me  quite a lot. When the Germans behind the haystack found we were slacking off,  they made a rush to come at us, but I fired so thick and fast all of a sudden  that they thought we&rsquo;d got fresh supplies and sneaked back again behind their  hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  how could you sell it after that!&rdquo; said the child. But the old man shouldered  it determinedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belgium  shall have it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come on, ma p&rsquo;tite. How much do you think it will fetch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  thousand pounds?&rdquo; hazarded the child,&mdash;&ldquo;ten thousand pounds?&mdash;a million? Oh,  Grandpa, p&rsquo;raps they&rsquo;ll give a million for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  the old man was hardly a whit behind her in his fond notion of the value of the  thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it fetched a clear fifty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At  nine o&rsquo;clock the attendance in the hall was still sparse, and the stalls were  still overflowing with ornamental articles, but the kitten had been sold and  re-sold until the sum of eight pounds was reached.</p>
<p>The  auctioneer, who had an eye for effect, had taken Cathie up on the platform with  him and she stood beside him, the little cat on her shoulder and an eager eye  on the audience.</p>
<p>And  the little cat made itself so entirely at home, and washed itself with such  extreme innocence while its fate was being decided, that it simply charmed bids  out of the mouths of the people.</p>
<p>Finally  it fell to a soft-eyed girl who had just come in from a motor-car to &ldquo;show up&rdquo;  in place of her wealthy and weary-in-well-doing parents. She had brought two or  three sovereigns to spend as in duty bound, and had just been casting about  languidly for the least vexatious things to spend it on, when the auction of  the kitten began.</p>
<p>Eight  pounds was a good deal, however, even for a wealthy girl, to give for a kitten  that, however innocent of eye and blue of fur, was still undoubtedly half  &ldquo;plain cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  excitement of the auction over, and the kitten in her arms showing unmistakable  symptoms of a disposition to scratch, the girl felt sobered and anxious to get  home and see whether she could coax the extra five pounds out of her father  instead of taking it out of her own allowance.</p>
<p>But  she paused a moment to watch the succeeding auction.</p>
<p>The  auctioneer again thought it an effective move to produce the owner of the  article to be sold, as well as the article, and the white-haired old man  crossed the platform with proud eyes and a shaky step rendered still more shaky  by the weight of the weapon.</p>
<p>The  auctioneer explained matters carefully: this was a gun he was about to sell, a  real &ldquo;chassepot&rdquo; that had been at the battle of Sedan and had sent many a  German to a warmer climate than that of Germany. This was a gun generously  presented to them by the man who had stood behind it on that unforgotten day,  and that would be a proud person into whose possession it passed. Who would  start the bidding for it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;T-t-t-en  shillings,&rdquo; said a shabby schoolboy, stuttering between his eagerness to  possess such a treasure and his shame at the smallness of his bid.</p>
<p>The  old man on the platform looked down at him with a sort of royal benevolence. He  had been a poor schoolboy himself.</p>
<p>The  incident took his thoughts to certain French schoolboys who had seen and  reverently fingered his old weapon and dreamed of &ldquo;La Revanche,&rdquo; and who were  now in the trenches of Ypres trying, with  rifles of a later pattern, to obtain it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  pound,&rdquo; said the chief barber of the suburb. It was more than he gave usually  for the wall ornaments of his saloon, but this was war-time and the tastes of  customers must be met, even pandered to.</p>
<p>The  old man on the platform looked down at this bidder too, but there was no  benevolence in his gaze: he had never been a barber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-two  and six,&rdquo; said the schoolboy, his face white at the thought of the  impossibility of paying such a sum and yet forcibly impelled to the offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  shillings,&rdquo; said the barber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty,&rdquo;  shouted the boy.</p>
<p>The  barber smiled, shook his head, gave up.</p>
<p>No  other voice raised itself.</p>
<p>What  use had an audience such as was gathered there for a battered, rusty weapon of  war? Weapons of war, new and effective, were wearifully common objects in  households now-a-days. And what was Sedan,  anyway? If it had been a ham offered, now, or a large pumpkin, or a doll, or a  cushion, or another kitten with an engaging expression! But a gun,&mdash;however real  the auctioneer might insist it was! Who wanted it? Were not all guns real guns  now?</p>
<p>The  auctioneer stuck to his task for a hard five minutes, trying to get an advance  on that thirty shillings, but no one moved. Numberless articles awaited his  attention&mdash;he could waste no more time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty  shillings,&rdquo; he cried,&mdash;&ldquo;this gun that was at Sedan,&mdash; it&rsquo;s a shame, a crying shame&mdash;thirty  shillings? No one make it two pounds? Going. Gone. It&rsquo;s yours, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  seized a pink and green cushion and began work again.</p>
<p>The  old man tottered off the platform with bewildered eyes, yielding his gun to the  eager boy who met him at the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  say!&rdquo; stuttered the lad, fondling it, &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; His eyes were moist: he might  have been a mother with her first child in her arms.</p>
<p>The  old man sat heavily down on the nearest bench.</p>
<p>But  now the girl, Joan Mansfield, who had bought the kitten, steered a course  through the hall for the ice-cream marquee to which she had sent her chauffeur  while he waited for her.</p>
<p>She  refused firmly on the way to be drawn into raffles or indeed to spend one other  penny; that eight pounds weighed heavily upon her mind even though the kitten,  after a searching examination of her soul, had now accepted her and snuggled down  peacefully in her arms.</p>
<p>But  just outside the ice-cream tent she heard a sob, a very bitter sob, and looking  down in the half-light found the small owner of the cat fairly drowned in  tears.</p>
<p>It  was a sweet, unspoiled young heart that beat underneath the ultra-fashionable  motor-coat: it at once stifled the feeling that was growing in it for the  little blue cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here  you are, darling,&rdquo; she murmured, stooping over the poor atom, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your kitty  back. I don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  she found that the poor atom was something more than an eight-year-old who had  made a sacrifice that was too much for its years. The kitten was thrust back at  her, and with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not crying for her!&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. Eight pounds is a lovely lot. I  wouldn&rsquo;t have her back for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  why are you crying?&rdquo; asked the young lady, relieved that she might have  something, after all, to take home to account for her transient insanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h,&rdquo;  said the child and dissolved again into an amorphous atom,&mdash;&ldquo;thirty shillings.  Poor Grandpa! Oh-h-h! Grandpa&rsquo;s gun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gathered  in the same circle that held the cat, all the history of the ancient firearm  came out. </p>

<p>They  were playing cards for high stakes in the smoking-room of the huge expensive  flats down on the water&rsquo;s edge of the suburb.</p>
<p>Mr.  Mansfield was amongst them, who had transferred to his daughter the duty of  appearing at the Fete for the Belgians, while he entertained more pleasantly  his friends from the city, wealthy merchants like himself, at cards.</p>
<p>Into  this sacred room, into this atmosphere of smoke and peacefulness, burst the  eager-eyed, spoiled girl with her story of the gun from Sedan.</p>
<p>They  must put down their cards this minute; they must get into their motor cars that  were waiting outside and come and bid against each other with all their might  and main for that gun. They must stop at the doors of two or three more  expensive flats in the near vicinity and storm smoking-rooms and drag forth  more moneyed men to the fray.</p>
<p>It  may have been the eloquently-presented notion of the old man sitting stunned by  his unsuccessful sacrifice. Or it may just have been because the girl&rsquo;s eyes  were sweetly fringed and the dimple in her chin a distracting one.</p>
<p>At  all events they came, to a man.</p>
<p>But  in the town hall once more the girl remembered that she still had work to do.  She still had to possess herself of the gun which was the undoubted belonging  now of a shabby schoolboy.</p>
<p>She  had made sure that he would not have left the fete.</p>
<p>When  you have sweetly-fringed eyes and a dimple that your girl friends openly envy,  you know that you have only to say &ldquo;wait&rdquo; and he waits, even if he be only a  schoolboy quite unknown to you and undoubtedly shabby.</p>
<p>He  was waiting near the ice-cream booth, still hugging the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  she said, laying her hands on it, &ldquo;you will help us, won&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;ll let us  have it to sell again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  sell again! His gun from Sedan!  He looked at her in absolute horror. He held the firearm in a deathless grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got plenty of buyers now. It went  too cheap before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too  cheap! And he had impoverished himself of the next three quarters&rsquo; pocket-money  at least&mdash;had borrowed from a relative who would exact the uttermost farthing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-m-my  gun,&rdquo; he stuttered. &ldquo;I bought it. Thirty shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;of course you did, and it was very generous of you to  bid when hardly anyone else would. But now we want you to be still more  generous and give it back to us &mdash;for the sake of that poor old man&mdash;and Belgium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  boy swallowed hard, looked at her piteously one half moment, then thrust it  blindly into her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  just frightfully sporting of you,&rdquo; she murmured, for she had suddenly seen the  pain in his eyes. &ldquo;Come on back in the hall and let&rsquo;s see what it fetches. And,  of course, that thirty shillings is my affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  heart that had been so suddenly emptied just as suddenly filled. It was his  gift to Belgium  now, whatever sum was realised. The debt he had hung round his neck would be a  thing to rejoice his heart during the coming three quarters.</p>
<p>They  had to shake the old man to make him realise the situation: he seemed sunk in a  sort of dull stupor, sitting at the back of his daughter-in-law&rsquo;s stall, with  Cathie silently holding his hand.</p>
<p>Soon  they had him tottering on the stage again with the poor old gun on his  shoulder, but there was no confidence this time in his faded eyes.</p>
<p>The  bidding started at twenty pounds; leapt to thirty, to fifty, to seventy, and  then by five pounds at a time to a hundred.</p>
<p>When  it was knocked down at that sum the bidders cheered the owner. When he came  down from the stage they crowded round him, hitting him gently on the back,  making him tell them of Sedan  again, and how it felt to shoot and be shot at. He even sang for them in his  quavering voice bits of the Tipperaries of his day. They wildly encored his  &ldquo;snuff box&rdquo; ditty, with its refrain&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;This  snuffbox here of mine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holds right good rapparee.<br>
  For thy snub-nose, Bismarck,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This first-class snuff shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  had to take him home in one of the cars afterwards: one can get drunk with joy  at eighty as easily as with wine at eighteen.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="DiscordandCounterpoint"></a>Discord and  Counterpoint<br>
  A Story of the Australian Press</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>By Montague  Grover</em></p>
<p>Imagination  and the &rsquo;phone are probably the two most important attributes of  twentieth-century press work. But at times both are apt to prove whited  sepulchres&mdash;imagination when its propeller races, and the &rsquo;phone when it follows  the ca&rsquo; canny system of industrialism. On the occasions when both conspire to  abuse the confidence placed in them, something resembling a journalistic  cataclysm follows, and, if remedies can minister to the situations which  result, such remedies have to be appropriately heroic. It was an heroic remedy  which Baxter applied to the position created by the wreck of the Leonora,  rehabilitating him in the eyes of the Powers as a safe and sound reporter, and  bringing heartburning and anguish to the heart of James E. Gale, master  mariner, of Portland, Oregon, U.S.A., who, for a few brief hours, had revelled  in the ecstasy of prospective millionairedom on the strength of many dollars to  be won in the courts of law from the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; Newspaper Company Limited of  Sydney, New South Wales.</p>
<p>In  the bad old days, before Dr. Bell and Mr. Thomas Alva Edison had made &ldquo;the  little man in the box&rdquo; such an important feature of journalistic life, the city  would have had its breakfast ignorant of the fact that there had been an  exciting wreck at the Heads, with all the thrilling accompaniments of heroism,  self-sacrifice and rescue. It would probably have been ignorant of the very  existence of the American barque Leonora. It certainly would have known nothing  of its gallant skipper. And even when the story was told in the evening papers,  it would never have learned that that same gallant skipper had accomplished a  deed of derring-do unprecedented in nautical lore, revealing courage of such stupendous  calmness and deliberation as to make the gallantry of previous gallant skippers  pale into insignificance.</p>
<p>It  was the &rsquo;phone, which everybody in his time has cursed to the lowest depths of  Erebus, which exalted James E. Gale, master mariner, to a niche of fame level  with that of Nelson, Paul Jones, Farragut, Hobson, and other great ones  possessed of reputations made on a liquid basis, such exaltation being valued  by the legal advisers of James E. Gale at &pound;3,000, failing payment of which they  instructed the manager of the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; Newspaper Company Limited they would  issue a writ without further notice. Incidentally, they demanded a full and  ample apology inserted in a position as prominent as the original  article&mdash;which, as Euclid  would say, was absurd&mdash;not that Captain Gale bothered about the apology at all.  If he got 14,000 dahlars, he told his legal advisers, he would be satisfied,  and he guessed they would be some lawyers.</p>
<p>Although  the &rsquo;phone was the originating factor of this unpleasant incident&mdash;the causa  causans, as Captain Gale&rsquo;s legal advisers would have said&mdash;it is impossible to  deny that the imagination of Billy Baxter, of the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; reporting staff, was  altogether blameless. Even with the &rsquo;phone working in the shocking manner it  was that night, it is tolerably certain that, had the end of the wire been held  by Brown, who did the High Court, or McKenzie, who did the cattle sales, the  public would have missed the sensation of the year, and the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; would have  missed a threat of action, together with an increased circulation of some  hundreds of readers who &ldquo;went over&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Despatch,&rdquo; owing to the latter  journal&rsquo;s having missed such a fine news item. Baxter&rsquo;s imagination must accept  portion, at any rate, of the blame, but it is entitled to plead in extenuation  that it made full amends for its excess of zeal.</p>
<p>The  first intimation of the wreck came at about 11 p.m. The Heads rang up to report  that a large vessel had gone ashore on the rocks half a mile from the entrance.  Who she was, what had happened, they did not know. Four seconds after the  news-editor had hung up the receiver, the news editor had sent Gates out for a  taxi, had told two other men to throw away the copy they were writing, and get  out to the Heads with Gates, and had set the switch ringing round every police  station in the city for Baxter. Having done this, he sat down to map out his  plan of campaign. It was late, very late; there was no chance of any of the men  sent to the Heads getting back in time to write their copy. It was a &rsquo;phone  job, or nothing. If the &rsquo;phones went sour, it meant being scooped, and being  scooped badly. He knew that Gates would not rely solely on the departmental  &rsquo;phone. He possessed sufficient powers of bluff and persuasion to get his men  on to some private subscribers. Still, it was a dirty night, and &rsquo;phones have  an annoying habit of working badly on dirty nights, when they are most required  to work well. He allotted Baxter to one of the office &rsquo;phones; two other senior  men to others. The three had to get their stories, as best they could, from the  three men at the other end, and when they had told him the &ldquo;strength&rdquo; in twenty  words apiece, he intended to distribute the work of writing up. This would  prevent the duplication otherwise inevitable, and provide for the fullest  report in the time available.</p>
<p>Meanwhile  there was nothing to be done but sit by the &rsquo;phones and watch the clock&mdash;that  is, nothing for the news editor and two reporters. Baxter was already preparing  his main headlines and writing odd sentences on different slips of paper,  sentences which could be fitted in afterwards where most appropriate. During  the ensuing hour, the Heads rang up five times. Each ring gave a few additional  particulars. The vessel was the Leonora&mdash;that fact itself was good enough for  half a column built out of the Shipping Register, and the &ldquo;Shipping Gazette.&rdquo;  The lifeboat had been launched. This made another half column. The whole of the  people living around the Heads had been aroused and, deserting their houses,  had made for the scene of the disaster. The musical critic who had just filed  his copy of a concert, was seized, just as he was going home, to write an  imaginative story of the scene. As he knew the district well, and had some  imagination&mdash; although he was a musical critic&mdash;he turned out a fine picturesque  three-quarters of a column. As each of these bits of information came along  Baxter himself incorporated them in the general introduction he was preparing,  avoiding repetition and introducing a feature here or an incident there as its  probability struck him. Still, his heart sank, for with each successive ring  the &rsquo;phone was growing less dependable. The last conversation from the Heads  had consisted wholly of vowel sounds, many intelligible only by the context,  all blurred and chopped and battered. At last, the bell sounded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gates  speaking,&rdquo; he heard, but he heard it largely because that was the sentence in  his mind, the sentence he had been waiting for for the last weary hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo;  he replied, &ldquo;Baxter here. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was something like what Omar described as the rumble of the distant drums. Then  a hen clucked, clucked, clucked interminably, as if triumphing over the very  championship of an egg-laying competition.</p>
<p>Baxter  used shocking language. He strained his ear and heard what sounded like &ldquo;Oh, I  saw.&rdquo; Then followed what is one of the most exasperating features of modern  civilisation&mdash;a man yelling loudly at one end of a wire, a man listening  intently at the other, and howling back, &ldquo;Say it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  came again, &ldquo;Oh, I saw.&rdquo; Baxter repeated the phrase in his mind, thinking over  everything that might rhyme with it. Message-taking by bad &rsquo;phones is fine  training for poets. At last, he hit it, &ldquo;No lives lost,&rdquo; he repeated excitedly.  He heard Gates say <em>Het</em> or <em>Bed</em> or <em>Rep</em> at the other end, and knew his conjecture  was confirmed.</p>

<p>Piece  by piece, fragments of the story were torn from the reluctant receiver. Some  sentences were never translated&mdash; Baxter abandoned them as causing too much  delay&mdash;some were translated into half a dozen different forms before their  meaning could be guessed. Still, he was collecting the scraps of information  which he would eventually lay before the public as a complete, close-fitting  mosaic. Gates had told him how the captain ran for shelter when the storm broke  at about 5 p.m.. How he was steering a good course when the conditions rose to  something resembling a typhoon taking the vessel completely out of control and  banging her on the rocks, just as he contrived to let the rocket go. Gates got  through sufficient of the rescue work to form the foundation of a fine column  and a half by one of the other men, and enabled Baxter to write some thrilling  copy about the wait of the men on the doomed ship for the rescue party. Only  one rocket, and that their last, had been fired. They did not know if it had  been seen, and there they were, tight on a rock at the bottom of a 100-foot  cliff, with big green seas sweeping them, expecting the barque to break up  every minute. It was during this awful wait that the captain did his greatest  work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  did he do?&rdquo; cried Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue  good men ham sang now,&rdquo; Gates appeared to remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue  good men ham sang now,&rdquo; repeated Gates. &ldquo;Sang&mdash; sang now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sang?&rdquo;  asked Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wet,&rdquo;  replied Gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sang,  got that. Sang to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue  good&mdash;&rdquo; began Gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know, I know,&rdquo; said Baxter. &ldquo;But you said he sang to them. Do you know what it  was he sang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue  good try if ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship,  ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  stick to the ship, boys,&rdquo; yelled Baxter, delightedly. &ldquo;That right? He sang,  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Stick to the Ship&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue  good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind repeating it, Gates. I&rsquo;ve got it. It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baxter  hung up the receiver delighted that, in spite of all the difficulties, they had  been able to clean up the story. Very little was left for the evening press.  And the best of it all was that they had secured the salient incident of the  whole affair, the heroic captain standing on his deck in the face of almost  certain death, and singing a song, popular and sentimental and appropriate, to  inspire his men with further courage.</p>
<p>Baxter  featured the song&mdash;two verses, he asserted, were sung, and he made reference to  Captain Gale being possessed of a &ldquo;robust baritone,&rdquo; which could be heard even  above the howling of the wind. Mention was made of other notable mariners who  had remained cool as cucumbers in the face of almost certain death, but none of  these had sung songs or apparently thought of singing them. Only Captain Gale,  the latest hero, had done this, and, in his story, Baxter left the impression  that, by this one bright deed, Captain Gale was a much more heroic hero than  all previous heroes.</p>
<p>As  for Captain Gale himself, he and his merry men&mdash;none of whom seemed to share the  enthusiasm of those of the Australian public present for their leader&mdash;were put  up at the hotel nearest the Heads, where, after being given dry clothes and  after consuming a quantity of alcoholic stimulant in front of a fire, they went  to bed. Captain Gale awoke at about nine o&rsquo;clock and had his breakfast. As he  started to consume his ham and eggs, he propped the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; before him against  the cruet stand. His eye caught the headlines and he dropped his knife and  fork, making identically the same remark which Baxter had made the night  previous when the &rsquo;phone went back on him. The waitress who had been performing  some appropriate hero worship at his elbow, fled in alarm. The heroes she had  been accustomed to encounter across the footlights never used language like  that.</p>
<p>He  cast the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; to the floor. He called to Gustafsen, his first mate, who was  just filling his pipe at the other end of the room, and expressed his opinion  of Australians generally, and Australian newspapers in particular. He called  them what he usually reserved for members of his crew with Socialistic  tendencies. Gustafsen, whose knowledge of English was confined to the  technicalities of seafaring life, was loyally sympathetic, but didn&rsquo;t really  know what had made the old man angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess I&rsquo;ll see th&rsquo; cahnsul, Gustafsen,&rdquo; said Captain Gale. &ldquo;Makin&rsquo; an American  citizen look a dern fool. Say, Gustafsen, am I a sailorman who knows his game,  or am I a galoot who&rsquo;d get up an&rsquo; sing ragtime when ma ship was on th&rsquo; rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  you doesn&rsquo;t, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; replied Gustafsen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess not,&rdquo; roared Captain Gale. &ldquo;Every man afloat&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m bughouse. Who&rsquo;d  trust a ship with a son of a cook who tried ter charm th&rsquo; storm with vocal  music. Am I a Christian Science navigator or a ship&rsquo;s captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; agreed the first mate.</p>
<p>Captain  Gale ate his breakfast as a duty, not as a pleasure. It was as if he were  chewing and swallowing sawdust. He hurried into the city, saw his agents, saw  the American Consul, and saw a firm of solicitors, with the result stated.</p>
<p>As  luck happened, Gates, who had been up all night, was in the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; office when  the general manager entered the sub-editor&rsquo;s room with a letter in his hand.  Gates, who was studying that day&rsquo;s paper, just waited long enough to grasp the  purport of the letter, which was the demand for &pound;3,000 in reparation of the  cruel and infamous libel committed that day on an estimable American citizen.  Then he slipped out of the door as speedily and as silently as he could, for  the incident of the song, starred in the double column headlines, had  astonished him even as it had astonished the outraged Captain himself. He had  no desire to be cross-examined on the report until he had consulted Baxter.</p>
<p>Baxter  he found in bed, still sleeping the sleep that comes to the reporter who lays  himself down with the consciousness of good work well done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the row, Jimmy?&rdquo; demanded the yawning Baxter as he sat up in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Row!  that&rsquo;s an understatement,&rdquo; explained Gates. &ldquo;Row&rsquo;s nothing to what&rsquo;s happened.  Writ for three thousand. Gale, captain of the Leonora, &rsquo;s seen his lawyers already  and shot in a writ over that report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale!&rdquo;  said Baxter. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s the hero of the hour. That story&rsquo;s been cabled through  to London and New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes  it worse and worse,&rdquo; replied Gates. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the singing business he kicks at.  What on earth made you fake on a thing like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fake;  it wasn&rsquo;t fake. Didn&rsquo;t you tell me he sang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a word,&rdquo; replied Gates. &ldquo;I kept trying to tell you he sang out to swim for it  the moment the vessel went to pieces. I couldn&rsquo;t hear what you said, but I  gathered you&rsquo;d got it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  he didn&rsquo;t sing at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a note. And you not only made him sing, but gave the name of the song, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll  Stick to the Ship, Boys,&rsquo; and said he reeled off two verses and praised his  rich baritone voice&mdash;rich was it, or powerful, or something like that. I know it  reminded me of Grand Opera criticism. I wonder you didn&rsquo;t drag in the  woodwinds. If I&rsquo;d told you it was a timber boat, you would have for a  certainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baxter  sat up with his knees in his hands. Then he laughed.
  My word; it&rsquo;s got a humorous side, this tragedy. What a shock James E. Gale  must have got when he found we&rsquo;d put him among the vocal wonders. By the way,  is he a baritone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know. Maybe a silvery tenor. Perhaps that&rsquo;s the libel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baxter  did five minutes hard thinking. Then the imagination which had got him into  trouble felt repentant and started working again. </p>
<p><a name="page036"></a></p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300031h-images/page036.jpg" alt="page036" width="550" height="750"></h3>
<p>He  bounded from bed, and started dressing. &ldquo;Where are the crew?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moved  up to the Sailors&rsquo; Home this morning,&rdquo; replied Gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo;  replied Baxter. &ldquo;How much money have you got on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five  or six pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got three. That&rsquo;ll do for a start. Now for the Sailors&rsquo; Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  the reading room of that estimable institution, they found the crew&mdash;&ldquo;seven men  from all the world back to port again.&rdquo; Two were Americans, New Yorkers, the  only Americans Baxter had met who used the dialect of the Bowery, saying <em>de</em> and <em>dat</em> for <em>the</em> and <em>that</em>. One was English, a Birmingham lad. Three were  Finns and the last a Filipino with a name that seemed to have been taken from  the programme of opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  boys had a bad time last night,&rdquo; said Baxter sympathetically. &ldquo;How is it for a  drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  desired privacy, and the reading room of a public institution, however  estimable, is not the place for conversations of a fiduciary nature. They  crossed the road to the bar parlor of an hotel and Baxter ordered the drinks  while he studied the characters of the men. They talked of the wreck and of the  hardness of a seafaring life. &ldquo;Stiff&rdquo; Molloy, one of the Bowery boys, expressed  the opinion in the terse and picturesque diction of his native district that if  any degenerate person, with the bar sinister on his escutcheon, ever caught him  going to sea again, he would be willing to submit to shocking punishment.  Baxter sized him up as the leader of the party. He called him outside, leaving  Gates to entertain the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See  here, Mr. Molloy,&rdquo; opened Baxter, dropping into the vernacular, &ldquo;I figure it  that among these boys what you say goes.&rdquo; Molloy grinned: &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he  agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you hold a sort of franchise over them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy  nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  if you remember the old man standing on the deck singing, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Stick to the  Ship, Boys,&rsquo; to buck up your courage, they&rsquo;ll remember it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  seaman did not reply. He looked at Baxter hard and meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  suppose you&rsquo;re from Missouri,  Mr. Molloy. I know what that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s  de goods,&rdquo; replied Molloy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s de rake-off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; explained Baxter. &ldquo;Some people have bad memories, and in the  excitement and horror of an experience like you had last night, it&rsquo;s no wonder  anybody forgetting. Now your captain&rsquo;s clean forgotten about singing you that  song. It was a most game thing of him to do, but he&rsquo;s too modest; he&rsquo;s  forgotten it. The only thing to make him remember properly is a statutory  declaration, you know what that is&mdash;an affidavit&mdash;from all you fellows that he <em>did</em> sing it. I suppose if you were to  get, say, &pound;10 for yourself, and &pound;1 for each of those other boys, they&rsquo;d  remember enough to swear to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molloy&rsquo;s  eye brightened. &ldquo;Yous cough up de roll, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll bet dey do,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Baxter  pulled the money out of his pocket, counted it out and then paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  I get the declarations&mdash;&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Missouri, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  called Gates out of the room, sent Molloy in, and in five minutes the Bowery  boy appeared at the door again. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s de judge?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  the boys remember?&rdquo; asked Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;  replied Molloy, turning to his companions, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t yous? Yous know how de old  man got up when he thought she was smashin&rsquo; and sung, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Stick to de Ship,  Boys,&rsquo; an&rsquo; how it was just de dope we wanted when we was all in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;  replied the other American; the Englishman winked; the Finns smiled, and Ernani  Ramon de Montabello of Manila  grinned, showing his whole set of teeth.</p>
<p>The  rest was easy. Baxter wrote out the declarations and at the office of Tom  Gloucester, J.P., an old and trusted friend, seven men from all the world  solemnly kissed the Bible and swore on their immortal souls that James E. Gale,  master mariner, had inspired them to further battle with the elements by his  spirited rendition of the stirring ballad, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Stick to the Ship, Boys,&rdquo;  whereby in their joint and several opinions their lives were spared.</p>
<p>Later  in the day, when Baxter reached the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; office, he attended the room of the  general manager in response to a brief note in the rack. The general manager,  with a very serious face, handed Baxter the letter from the firm of solicitors.  Baxter&rsquo;s smile didn&rsquo;t shift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought something of the sort might occur. Captain Gale passed through a  terrible time,&rdquo; he said blandly. &ldquo;So I just got a little substantial evidence  from the only people competent to express an opinion. Here&rdquo;&mdash;he cast a number of  official-looking papers on the table&mdash;&ldquo;are the statutory declarations of the  members of the crew, bearing out our report in every detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  general manager glanced at the papers and heaved a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think we&rsquo;ll hear any more of this, Mr. Baxter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d be a little&mdash;a  little&mdash;well, sceptical about the telephones in future, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baxter  strode out of the office with his eye bright and his gait springy. But when he  turned into the corridor, he twisted up his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen  quid!&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Sixteen beautiful golden jim. Well&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be helped; it was  the only way.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center"><em>By Mrs.  Aeneas Gunn</em></p>
<p>The  homestead was in the throes of preparations for a three weeks&rsquo; complexity of  musterings, and cattle-holdings, and cattle drovings, and appointments east,  west and north: preparations for a systematic getting together of a goodly mob  of bullocks for, even then waiting, drovers. And a mustering to spread-out  south and east, and work round north and west to a drawing-together on  north-western borders of lesser culled mobs into one combined mob for delivery;  and necessitating, perhaps, more than usual bustle among pack-bags, and stores,  and pack-teams, and busiest black-boys, and all else in and about the homestead  by way of those preparations.</p>
<p>Necessitating  also,&mdash;in the making of those appointments,&mdash; much ticking-off of days and  distances on fingers for the appointing of &ldquo;Saturday next&rdquo; here, and &ldquo;Thursday  week&rdquo; there, on to a culminating &ldquo;next Friday fortnight&rdquo; and its &ldquo;Saturday  following,&rdquo; for the checking and passing-on, and gathering together of those  lesser culled mobs: but, incidentally to the mystification of Bett-Bett&rsquo;s  ever-investigating, queer, little piccaninny mind:&mdash; &ldquo;What name, missus,  white-fellow all day savey, Monday Tuesday, Monday Tuesday?&rdquo; she came to the  more leisured house verandah to ask; peering out into sparkling sunlight and  sunny blue skies for a sign: with last touches then to preparations to find her  carefully testing the unanimity of her &ldquo;white-fellow&rdquo; world by enquiring the  day&rsquo;s identity from each individual member of kitchen, and house, and men&rsquo;s  quarters, out even to a chance traveller&rsquo;s camp. And, &ldquo;just as well to be  unanimous in these things!&rdquo; appreciated those arrangements; for even &ldquo;next  Friday fortnight&rdquo; to prove the exceeding need for unanimity in such things, where  cattle-runs think little of a million or so of acres.</p>
<p>Friday  fortnight,&mdash;appointed that ticking-off&mdash;a certain &ldquo;Gordon&rsquo;s camp&rdquo; of our Roper  River &ldquo;country&rdquo;; and the Head Stockman&rsquo;s gathered-up mob, thirty miles to our  north beside sweet sure waters. And for that &ldquo;Saturday following,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Yellow  Hole,&rdquo; fifteen miles to the west again; and its holding yards, and that  gathering-up of all for delivery &ldquo;before the Sunday.&rdquo; With the Maluka to make  whichever camp best suiting the chance of the moment and general station  business. And all going well with &ldquo;Saturday next,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thursday week,&rdquo; and all  comings, and goings, and musterings, &ldquo;Friday fortnight&rdquo; dawned optimistic to a  degree even as the Maluka and I,&mdash;to be precise, the Boss and the Missus,&mdash;rode  out by the north slip-rails, followed by an amiably-sauntering old packhorse;  with faithful canine, fox-terrier &ldquo;Brown,&rdquo; trotting blithely on ahead as his  own matter-of-course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  need for a black-boy!&rdquo; we had said; with every available horse-boy needed  elsewhere. &ldquo;Seeing we&rsquo;re to make Dan&rsquo;s camp by sundown!&rdquo; as we pointed out.  Merely carrying hobbles,&mdash; linked about each horse&rsquo;s neck as their own  matter-of-course,&mdash;for hobbling-out accessory to chance turn-out and later camp.</p>
<p>And,  &ldquo;anything in the way of a pack-horse,&rdquo; all that was necessary for the simplest  carrying of a single swag for a single day! had also been decreed,&mdash;with  packhorses also more than needed elsewhere: and one &ldquo;Euclid&rdquo; had fallen to our lot. &ldquo;Euclid,&rdquo; all simply,  because of &ldquo;so many points and angles,&rdquo; mental as well as physical.</p>
<p>Also,  a few sandwiches and a &ldquo;screw&rdquo; of tea in the Maluka&rsquo;s quart-pot,&mdash;with a &ldquo;bite&rdquo;  of tucker stowed away in saddle-pouch for Brown,&mdash;surely more than enough for a  midday turn-out! With the quart-pot for the making of the tea; and a cup for  its drinking dangling from each saddle. While Euclid&rsquo;s &ldquo;grazing-beat&rdquo; being of the Gordon&rsquo;s  camp &ldquo;country,&rdquo; his going could only prove a willing ambling home! capped that  optimism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,  a sadly maligned old horse!&rdquo; decided that mid-day turn-out: touched with the  morning&rsquo;s docile followings by such track, and river-way, and by-track, as our  going had been pleased to meander-in for chance inspection, and the making of a  riverside turn-out; and with that turn-out justifying also <em>its</em> especial optimism even to half-a-dozen sandwiches and a fair  pinch of tea, over and above mid-day needs, going back into the Maluka&rsquo;s quart-pot.  &ldquo;Waste not, want not!&rdquo; suggested the Maluka, advising that frugal stowing away  &ldquo;lest Dan should be late in his getting-in.&rdquo; &ldquo;A bird in the hand, you know!&rdquo; he  said. And, had we but known it, the first warning note had been struck.</p>
<p>With  by way of other warning, perhaps,&mdash;for yet later incident,&mdash;Euclid, with that  afternoon&rsquo;s long going across trackless bushlands that sweep on then to  Gordon&rsquo;s camp, once the river was left behind, was to develop to aggravation  the desire to hang-back and loiter, and graze-off at unexpected tangents  through the sweet bush-grasses there: as his right, no doubt, over even these  borders of his &ldquo;grazing-beat;&rdquo; but necessitating by-the-way skirmishing at  times through the light timber, and varied assistance from Brown. But with  never a warning, beyond a strange surprising stillness as we rode, with the  sundown, into Gordon&rsquo;s also lightest timbered outskirts, to tell of the  brooding silence and unbroken stillness, and far-reaching emptiness awaiting  our tiny cavalcade as greeting, where all should have been stir, and bustle,  and every clanking busyness of a great cattle camp. &ldquo;Just as well to be unanimous  in these things!&rdquo; those preparations had appreciated, in whimsical superiority,  as Bett-Bett&rsquo;s referendum went on; with now, barely twelve-hour-old tracks of a  crowding cattle mob passing-out, in a wide westward sweep, from that so strangely-silent  rendezvous, telling only too eloquently that Dan&rsquo;s mob had come-in and gone-on  just one day before the allotted time.</p>
<p>And  with before the Maluka a loneliest possible isolation for that night&rsquo;s camp:  back there from all chance travellers&rsquo; camps and by-ways; and with it the  safeguarding of a woman,&mdash;in country, incidentally, touching at its east the  beat of &ldquo;outside&rdquo; blacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,  it might very well have been worse!&rdquo; we decided, with the buoyancy of long use  to inconvenience. For had we not our six sandwiches and that left-over pinch of  tea!</p>
<p>And  as for the horses, had we not also those hobbles for their safe  shortest-hobbling?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  our swag with us, too!&rdquo; we further rejoiced&mdash;swags at times passing-out before  us with the stockmen&rsquo;s pack-teams.</p>
<p>And  always those sandwiches! Three for supper and three for breakfast. One apiece  for each meal, allowing share-and-share-alike with Brown. And with plenty of  water,&mdash;and a camp-fire, a yet further matter-of-course,&mdash;always the easiest  boiling of the quart-pot for a supper half-share of the tea; and had we not  also the good warm earth beside a glowing camp-fire, for our settling-down in  expectant three-cornered supper array. With Brown, it is true, rather  disconcerting our share-and-share-alike comradeship by bolting his sandwich at  a gulp, and watching reproachfully as we made the most of our every crumb.  Still, poor Brown had not the comfort of the tea,&mdash;amazingly weak as it might  be; and those sandwiches were perhaps overneat in size in accommodating  themselves to the dimensions of a quart-pot. Yet how much worse it might have  been! as we now carefully explained to a dutifully-attentive Brown. For that  night in its passing-on to set itself, apparently, to prove just how much worse  it could arrange to be&mdash;&ldquo;when it tried,&rdquo; we were agreeing with the morning.</p>
<p><a name="page044"></a></p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300031h-images/page044.jpg" alt="page044" width="750" height="619"></h3>
<p>But  with nothing unusual about our turning-in, beyond an exceptionally early  turning-in to assure an exceptionally early start: &ldquo;for the overtaking of  breakfast,&rdquo; prompted further optimism. Just the usual swinging of a camp sleeping-net  between low-branching saplings near-by, and that swiftest slipping off into  deep sleep that is the heritage of the bush-folk; with Brown in his own  accustomed place curled-up close outside the net at its head. And just one  hour&rsquo;s oblivion; and then the low, subdued warning growl of a trained camp-dog  from Brown to scatter sleep to the four winds and bring us to our elbows, mechanically  reaching-out for revolvers: with&mdash;it will be remembered&mdash;Gordon&rsquo;s &ldquo;country&rdquo;  touching one beat of &ldquo;outside&rsquo;&rsquo; blacks,</p>
<p>But  never a chance of any sharp barking from Brown that would disclose our position  to roving folk of the bush night. And never a chance of even lowest growling,  on from that swift coming to attention; but with Brown&rsquo;s ears pricked to the  north-east for our guidance: steadily to follow some approaching movement  nearer round,&mdash;to the bristling of a, then standing, statue-like Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some  distance off and passing round about the camping ground,&rdquo; translated the  Maluka; and slipping-out of the net, masked the now-slumbering fire with  heaped-up loose earth. &ldquo;No necessity to provide a guiding star!&rdquo; he suggested  grimly, with that done, &ldquo;Yet, probably only some old blackfellow making a  passage across country!&rdquo; we assured ourselves: for that second hour of our  night to keep us at tension on elbows, as Brown&rsquo;s ears reported a  disconcertingly persistent circling, and hovering, and passing and repassing  about the farther-out borders there: a hovering at times breaking-up into three  separate hoverings demanding threefold attention from Brown. &ldquo;Seeking our  strength, maybe!&rdquo; suggested our tension. &ldquo;Or only eaten-up with curiosity, out  of a chance passing-by coming on hobbled-out horses, with never an attendant  &ldquo;boy&rdquo; responding to mysterious renderings of night-birds&rsquo; calls;&rdquo; amended our  third hour: in its passing, finding Brown&rsquo;s attention lengthening out always to  the southward, eventually, to the ending of all vigil even there, in a long  stretching yawn from Brown and a grunting all-satisfied curling-back to a  well-earned nap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just  as wise though to change the position of our net!&rdquo; advised bush prudence; with  ten minutes later finding us settling down a hundred feet or so deeper into a  convenient sapling grove. But in the darkness, unfortunately, camping on the  very margin of a main cattle-pad that led into the waters; as lowing warnings  and angry mutterings of our next two hours, and more, made only too clear. With  even an overtaking of comparative peace and quiet towards the dawn, as its own  last straw, to dumbfound that early start; for sun-up was to find Brown nudging  enquiringly into deepest slumbers, and all possibilities of breakfast crudely  summed up in those three allotted sandwiches, and further amazingly weak  tea,&mdash;and further reproaches from Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  with no limit to the possibilities the tracking-out of the horses might have in  store, as a last touch to the whole!&rdquo; the grimmest throwing-off of every  optimism was suggesting, out of grimmest past experiences; as the Maluka&rsquo;s  going-out, willy nilly, to that tracking-out, left a disconsolate woman,  revolver in hand, backed to a great, wide tree trunk, with a watchful  understanding Brown stiffly to attention at her feet. &ldquo;The wonder is that you  do not die of ennui!&rdquo; being the favourite reiteration of the mailbags. Also,  &ldquo;No need of a black-boy,&rdquo; it will be remembered, some far-away past had  suggested.</p>
<p>But  on gallant old Roper I had ridden out of that past. And when was he ever to  fail us? Wisest of old campaigners in a wisest making back for his camps with  the daylight. And with Roper come on in the Maluka&rsquo;s first half-turn of those  outer timbers what else could come about but that Roper would carry the Maluka  direct to those dilly-dallying others, to trot them briskly to camp within a  bare five minutes. And, &ldquo;That we should ever have doubted!&rdquo; we apologized,  caressing the beautiful, wise old head. With as merest passing detail now, the  Maluka&rsquo;s tracking-out having come on the tracks of some old bush blackfellow  and two attendant lubras.</p>
<p>Also:  &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well!&rdquo; the Maluka was saying, as another five minutes or  so found us riding out across that open country.</p>
<p>But  we had not yet done with Euclid.  For going west meaning going away from home for Euclid, as a beginning the  first mile had us hanging back, and loitering, and heading him off to set all  going again, with a dozen times the incident of the yesterday&rsquo;s afternoon  going; for the second mile to find the Maluka seeing what a leading rope would  do, to the immediate heartbreak of Euclid, who breaking into a pouring sweat  had to be rubbed down and unpacked, and made much of and finally repacked, and  done with as best we could for a next mile or so. But a mile or so playing such  havoc with our direction that Roper and I found ourselves called upon to do our  part in a steadiest, sedate going ahead of all skirmishing, with the setting of  the compass directing that our going should keep my shadow playing about  Roper&rsquo;s near ear,&mdash;which was easier decreed than done. A going eventually to eat  up exactly three hours for a bare seven miles, with every suggestion of a  leading rope only bringing on further cold sweatings and heart-breaks, and  further rubbings-down and repackings; and with Brown&rsquo;s the only luck of the  whole going, in his catching of an opportune young bandicoot,&mdash;to our envy, I  fear. But that seventh mile seeing the end to all patience of hunger, and all  else, swag and pack-saddle,&mdash;at a last aggravating stripping,&mdash;were dumped-down  beneath a distinguishing tree, to be left-till-called-for by some horse-boy to  be sent over our tracks. An arrangement giving opportunity for a last  perversity from Euclid, in a thenceforward amiable, persistent, stripped  following of all further miles, when his followings had become nothing to us.  &ldquo;Anything in the way of a pack-horse!&rdquo; as all had agreed.</p>
<p>With,  thus, even two hours after mid-day to find us riding into that last great  combined cattle-camp, and its plenty, and stir, and ridings, with a stripped  pack-horse at our heels&mdash;to the amazement of all there; to be greeted by a  welcoming call from a sublimely unsuspecting Dan, dutifully riding out from his  then concerns. &ldquo;What happened on Friday?&rdquo; he called. And: &ldquo;We camped at  Gordon,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;the prey of prowling blacks and wild bulls; and one of us  got down to bandicoot for breakfast, and Euclid&rsquo;s eaten his pack-saddle and  swag!&rdquo; And Dan, staring aghast as we reined-up all together among assembling  black boys and stockmen, &ldquo;Just as well to be unanimous in these things!&rdquo; we  mocked. &ldquo;It is now exactly two o&rsquo;clock, Saturday; and we&rsquo;ve lived on three  sandwiches for weeks!&rdquo; leaving Dan petrified beyond an utterly confounded:  &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blest! I never did that before!&rdquo; which was little consolation to our  hunger.</p>
<p>But  the Dandy&rsquo;s billy, as usual, was just about thinking of boiling; to prove indeed  that all&rsquo;s very well that ends well: even to Dan&rsquo;s recovery rejoicing in  &ldquo;getting the mob off before the Sabbath, after all!&rdquo; with the story of that  Sabbath, and our days of homeward journey told elsewhere.</p>
<p>Leaving  a last rounding-off of all to the homestead and the next week-end; with the  filtering-out of our woes to the black world there:&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Dan</em> no more savey days, Missus&rsquo;?&rdquo; Bett-Bett came once again to the  verandah to ask; and the spirit of humbug taking hold of Dan, with the Saturday  he, too, was at the verandah solemn-eyed as an owl. &ldquo;Why should not the  homestead have made the mistake, and not the musterers?&rdquo; <em>he</em> came to ask. &ldquo;Making this Sunday!&rdquo; he said severely, looking  askance at my sewing. With no peace then until it was put away, and that day accepted  as the Sabbath,&mdash;there being logic enough in his argument; and Bett-Bett&rsquo;s  doubts were transferred to the Missus.</p>
<p>But  next morning Dan was back again, all twinkling seriousness then. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been  going over that ticking-off,&rdquo; he reported, &ldquo;and find you and the Boss were right.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Making <em>this</em> the Sabbath,&rdquo; he  suggested amiably. And with our convictions all with that day&rsquo;s identity,  together with vivid word-pictures from Dan of &ldquo;Scotch ancestors turning in  their graves&rdquo; at the thought of the Missus &ldquo;going on with sewing there,&rdquo; the  house celebrated two Sabbaths that week&mdash;to the distraction of Bett-Bett. Until  the mailman&rsquo;s coming in from the South &ldquo;proving the homestead right after all!&rdquo;  was to convince Bett-Bett that the setting of &ldquo;days&rdquo; was not the least of his  duties.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="IntheShadows"></a>In the  Shadows</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>By Kathleen  Watson</em></p>
<p>There  are such good things in life&mdash;fine music, laughter, health, and love: stars and  flowers that shine: the chorus stealing through cathedral aisles at even-song:  the meeting and the greeting of a friend.</p>
<p>Richard  de la Prez, hard at work on the murky problems of his play, full of distaste at  the situation brought about by his own ingenuity, thought with regret of a  world that seemed far away &mdash;a world that held other things and cherished them.</p>
<p>He  thought of his friend, the poet, who had wound incomparable thoughts and words  round a theme which was a wilderness of grief.</p>
<p>He  thought of his friend, the painter, who also had strayed far from fields  elysian and the songs of Pan to burn into his canvas all the desolation of a  suicide&rsquo;s grave, with a child skipping past the clumsy mound, fearful and  afraid.</p>
<p>The  Te Deums and Magnificats&mdash;who put them now into colour, music, stone, or verse?  They had vanished before the mists of decadence; the minor songs of minor  souls; the wails of those crying out in the desert for what they supposed was  freedom; fighting against the desperate odds of convention; who, because their  hope was forlorn, walked as those having none indeed.</p>
<p>In  his heart, Richard de la Prez thought that the sunless outlook of his work was  an insult flung from the stage into the faces of the patient public who come to  the play, not to see the shadows and drab colours of the long day lengthening  behind the footlights: who come in their thoughtless thousands for anodyne,  forgetfulness; like children who rush from their lessons to a fairy tale or a  game at ball.</p>
<p>No  fairy tale, no living-happily-for-ever-after in the work of Richard de la Prez:  no such degradation or prostitution of his art. But he would fain have woven  into it some of the blue of the June sky outside: some of the rapture of homing  birds: some of the gladness of hearts at peace with each other and with all the  problems of their lives: for the mutual love of one for one is as some  chemical, rare and costly, in which problems are dissolved and disappear.</p>
<p>But  so rare it is, this chemical, and from such infinite processes has it been  evolved, that most men and women miss it altogether on their pilgrimage; while  others may discover it perhaps too late. With a twist at his heartstrings,  Richard de la Prez knew that he must not turn to any such solution of the paper  problems at his hand. Drab renunciation must ring in the ears of those tired  people in front: and the knowledge of that death which is the wages of sin.  Since he, the playwright who had arrived, he wrote of lives whose to-morrows  were swallowed up in their yesterdays: whose futures were mortgaged with their  pasts: whose present meant the paying of a bill&mdash;paid by some with grace; by  some with bravado or insousiance; by some with bitterness: but always there,  without relent, to be paid in full.</p>
<p>Often,  too, he thought of the stage antithesis of his own studies of the underworld of  suffering&mdash;the musical comedies which flooded the town and which were rightly  spoken of as having neither music nor comedy in their being.</p>
<p>The  Gentle Playgoer in his thousands turned to these and the folly of them, because  it is better to smile than to think: better to shake with empty laughter than  shiver with dread. Neither his intellect nor his emotions were touched for a moment.  There must be some charm between these two extremes of gloom and idiocy still  left to conjure with. The sunlit spaces of comedy, high comedy, that often in  life save tragedies from materializing: the sense and taste that step in  finely, to tide by the shoals and quicksands that beset: the haven that the  worst harassed soul finds sometimes even here: the hope that grows to a rich  fulfilment and the promise that ripens to a harvest beyond dreams&mdash;they are  real, these things; they have been and shall be again, thought Richard de la  Prez, though others, and not he, might sing their praise.</p>
<p>Lost  in calculations, he did not hear the lunch gong sounding through the deadness  of the house. It was the voice of his wife, querulous and high-pitched, on the  stairs outside his study, that aroused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t  you coming, Dick? Everything&rsquo;s getting cold. And we shall miss the beginning,  like we always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  he remembered that he had promised to take her to a matinee.</p>
<p>At  lunch she hurried him on and reminded him sharply again, that on no account did  she intend to miss the beginning, even if he did.</p>
<p>He  glanced at her, and said, so kindly that the irony was hidden quite:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  my dear, if that was only all that we had missed.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="TheYearAroundinTimberLand"></a>The Year  Around in Timber-Land</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>C. J. Dennis</em></p>
<p>Summer  is in her prime, and all the Bush seems like to swoon with drowsy luxury.  Beneath a cloudless sky of richest blue the Timber Hills like sleeping mammoths  crouch. In serried ranks the tall old trees stand up like quiet sentinels whose  sturdy limbs have braved the seasons for a century. They seem so old and wise,  these veterans, with mottled trunks scored by stone axes of some long dead  tribe; their dignity, their stern impassiveness, seem to upbraid the moods of  restless man, the pigmy, ever yearning after change. Beside them, stripling  spars grow sturdily; not yet so wise; but, like great healthy lads, they seem  impatient for maturity. And infant saplings, with their rich brown leaves  up-curled and soft as tiny baby hands, wave wide their limbs, and frolic in the  breeze like merry, careless children at their play. The hardy bracken,  quickened by the sun, has lost its tenderness of early Spring, and&mdash;like a man  grown greedy with the years, a sly, alert marauder keen for gain&mdash;with slow and  cunning fingers reaches out to steal anew the settler&rsquo;s hard-won field.</p>
<p>Nursed  in a shallow trough between the hills, the houses of the tiny settlement sleep  in the sun&mdash;a little world apart. The lazy smoke curls blue above the roofs,  telling of industry and toil within, where each lean bush-wife strives&mdash;as never  strove the women of the towns&mdash;to ease the load of labour for her man. Deep in  the forest, higher up the mount, the clip of axes and the drone of saws make  music in the sleepy summer noon. A team of bullocks, over dusty tracks, moves,  weirdly silent, saving for the creak of waggon timbers. His great whip aloft,  their driver hurls upon the patient beasts fierce rolling oaths and wild, rank  blasphemies, as guileless as the prattle of a child. His clothes, his face, his  hair, a single hue, are coated with the red dust of the track; a monochrome, in  which a sudden gleam of white teeth flashes as he loudly roars a cheery  greeting to a passing friend. He is in haste, he says, the rain is near, and  soon the bush tracks, axle-deep in mire, will stay the labour of the timber  teams; so his poor beasts, with sad, protesting eyes, must late and early toil  while days are dry. Yet he is but another prophet mocked; for still the tall  trees yearn to cloudless skies, and still the rank weeds riot in the sun.</p>
<p>The  days wax hotter; over distant hills a wreath of smoke has hovered for a week.  Fire! says the bushman. If the north wind stirs before the rain, the mount will  be ablaze.</p>
<p>Old  Ben, the pensioner, the pioneer of this rough settlement, before the door of  his rude hut, sits patiently all day, with rheumy eyes fixed on the  smoke-wreathed hills&mdash;familiar hills he can no longer see. &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; says he,  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have it now, for sure. And such a fire as none of yous can mind; one  like the blaze that robbed my house and home, one summer&mdash;when my missus was  alive.&rdquo; And with a hand, not like a human hand, so gnarled it is with years of  heavy toil, he hides a moment his old, wistful face, and sighs, &ldquo;When my poor  missus was alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  common, age-old tale they all know well: a woman, all too weak for this rough  life, a brave, pathetic fight against the Bush, the loneliness, the toil, the  drudgery, until&mdash;a self-sought death gave her release, and left a man who lived  on memories&mdash;a dazed, uncomprehending, broken man, who can not realise why here  the bush&mdash;his kindly bush&mdash;should be so pitiless.</p>
<p>The  heat still grows; and now, one lurid morn, as hot, and fierce, and fearsome as  the breath of some malignant dragon, comes the wind, the dread north wind that  down the gully sweeps, and trails destruction over all the land. Fire springs  from no where; here for half-a-mile it leaps a valley and tears on its way with  long, red fingers reaching for its prey.</p>
<p>A  pall of heavy smoke defies the sun, and in a strange, uncanny twilight stands  the little settlement, with all the world shut out.</p>
<p>Now,  eager little flames, like small red imps, race o&rsquo;er the ground and climb the  mighty trunks, to set the heads of forest seers ablaze. With harsh artillery of  falling trees&mdash;giants that crash like thunder to the ground&mdash;mingles the sharp  incessant fusillade of crackling flame, while all the tortured scrub shrinks  from the fire and writhes as if in pain.</p>
<p>About  the settlement, like tiny ants whose nest has been disturbed, the people haste.  A house saved here; and there, a line of fence is sacrificed, while men rush  down to save the Brices&rsquo; home&mdash;and come too late.</p>
<p>And  Brice, an arm about his youngest child, looks on with hopeless eyes half  humorous; then, turning to a neighbour, laughs and says, &ldquo; &rsquo;Twill boil a billy,  anyhow, for tea.&rdquo; Then moves away to mark how much is saved, and plan again the  labour of long years.</p>
<p>Then  comes the rain; and when next morning dawns it sees a land, black, smoking, desolate&mdash;a  land to break the hearts of some strong men. But these bush optimists, these  giant-hearts, look on it all as part of daily life, repair the damage, and go  back to work. The hat goes round for Brice, and halting words of sympathy are  tendered; he replies, more briefly yet, &ldquo;Ribuck! You&rsquo;re white men, boys. Well,  Summer&rsquo;s over, anyhow, for sure. We best buck in an&rsquo; make a cheque by Spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With  Autumn comes the closing of the roads, and, like a fort preparing for a siege,  the mountain folk lay in their winter store of simple fare&mdash;flour, sugar, tea  and jam. Now are the busy bush-wife&rsquo;s anxious day, and, uncomplaining, she  toils on, and asks no praise for all the sacrifice she gives. Bush wives&mdash; bush  mothers&mdash;giving all their lives bravely to build new homes in this new land&mdash;the  unsung heroines whose tragedies few know, and yet still fewer understand! But  when the children of a mighty land are thrilled with stories of the  pioneers&mdash;with age-old legends told in peaceful towns&mdash;bush-wives, bush martyrs,  then, at last, shall win a long-due reverence.</p>
<p>Yet  Autumn, here, is like another Spring, a ministering, kindly season she, healing  the wounds of that too ardent love that Summer gave. Then, like a clammy pall,  comes Winter, and the Bush weeps night and day. Frost lays his finger on all  growing things. Fog shrouds the tree-tops on the sodden hills, and, day and  night, the weeping of the trees brings thoughts of gloom and longing for the  sun.</p>
<p>On  days too wet for toil, men gather round the roaring fire of logs in some rude  home and talk of simple things, and gossip, too, of absent neighbours and the  wrongs they do. There&rsquo;s Bates, who made a cunning deal in cows&mdash;a waster, Bates,  a low-down rascal he. And Johnson says he would not raise a hand to aid him in  his last extremity. With oaths his name is mentioned, and his past raked over  to expose his ancient sins. Next morning comes the news that Bates is hurt,  and, they who yesterday vowed him a rogue, cast work aside and hasten to his  aid. Tender as women, down the mountain-side they bear him. Johnson, his most  bitter foe, risks neck and limb to gallop through the dark for help, and, by a  miracle, gets through. That&rsquo;s the bush way; the boon of simple minds, the  lasting brother-love that underlies all petty strife, and sweetens wondrously  the lives of those who toil and live as they.</p>
<p>Shy  gold begins to peep through sombre green&mdash;the wattle&rsquo;s wedding dress, and Spring  is near. The jocund Jacks laugh longer, and pert wrens, in new blue caps, flirt  in the undergrowth. Then, suddenly it seems, one golden morn, the Bush awakes,  a living, amorous thing. Flowers bloom, birds sing, and all the world puts on  its gayest dress to greet the laughing Spring.</p>
<p>After  the wattle, blackwood, kurrajong don wedding garb, and gipsy violets carpet the  earth, and in the underworld of tiny creatures, pupa cases burst, and  gay-winged things dance madly in the sun. The Bush has ceased to weep; and when  she smiles, she is a mistress not to be denied. The birds are mating, Winter  days are dead, and all the world cries out, &ldquo;To wed, to wed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bates  has recovered. It is Johnson now who does a deal in cows that brings him shame.  Down in the settlement, the women say young Sparks, a forward lad, is walking out with  Ryan&rsquo;s youngest daughter. It is Spring.</p>
<p>Outside  his hut, old Ben, the pensioner, wracked through the Winter by the &ldquo;rheumatiz,&rdquo;  stretches his legs and wags his withered head. &ldquo;Young folks,&rdquo; he says, and  leers; then looks away. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis Spring. I know, I know. An&rsquo; well I mind one  Springtime, when my missus was alive.&rdquo; . . . And then he rambles in a plaintive  tone, asking the Fates what strange thing ailed his mate. &ldquo;Full forty head of  fowls she had,&rdquo; he wails. &ldquo;What more could woman want? Three pigs she had, an&rsquo;  bacon hangin&rsquo; on the kitchen wall. What ailed her? Hadn&rsquo;t she the two best  cows&mdash;the best a woman ever sat beneath? And yet&mdash; ah, it&rsquo;s a queer, strange  world, it is, an&rsquo; I should know it after eighty years&mdash;an&rsquo; thirty since my  missus was alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The  angry Sun had taken a long time to go, stopping on his way every now and again  to shake a fist at the quarrelling nations. It was after dark, but somehow his  blood-red shadows still seemed to lie across the earth.</p>
<p>The  Woman In The Moon flung away her after-dinner cigarette, and, as its glowing  butt went shooting through space, an American savant won three days&rsquo; notoriety  for himself by the discovery of what he fondly imagined was a new comet. Then,  as the Woman looked earthwards, she gave a little half-shiver, half-shudder,  and hastily drew a grey gossamer cloud over her beautiful face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  are you hiding the light of your eyes, lady mine?&rdquo; It was Pierrot who  spoke&mdash;poor infatuated Pierrot, who went down to the pond at the foot of the  garden each night, so that he could gaze upon not only his love, but her  reflection as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I dare not look down on what I must see,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  listen to me,&rdquo; pleaded Pierrot. &ldquo;Million upon million of women on earth here  below are facing this night bravely. Fearlessly they look out into the  darkness, waiting for what the dawn may bring. Why should you, who have seen  the wars of all the ages, shrink from the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierrot,&rdquo;  she replied gently, &ldquo;each one of these women has to fear her own sorrows alone.  I have to sit here helplessly, witnessing and suffering the sorrows of them  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  when Pierrot, yearning for a sight of her face, would have spoken of love, she  sealed his lips with a long white finger and drew the cloud more closely about  her head. . . . Suddenly, from far down below, there came a tiny cry, where  some newly-born child had been thrust by Fate on to the scale of humanity so  sadly overbalanced by the God of War.</p>
<p>The  Woman In The Moon, sighed softly. &ldquo;They still need me on earth, I see,&rdquo; she  whispered, half to herself and half to Pierrot. . . . A baby moonbeam went  frolicking away to dance through a dark bedroom window and play with its little  mortal brother. . . . And with her own hands, jewelled with a hundred stars,  The Woman In The Moon slowly drew the veil from off her face.</p>

<p>In  that exquisite languor which follows sometimes upon long physical  effort&mdash;sometimes upon short superlative strain&mdash; Private Jack Hunter was lying  in the sand, every tired muscle of his overworked body relaxed. In the distance  he watched rose-coloured Arabs leading rose-coloured camels to a rose-coloured Nile. All about him was that rose light of a fading  Egyptian day, which transfigures everything, and is the wonder and glory of the  East. Far away the wedge top of Sinai, gray in daylight as its own traditions,  jutting just over the more sordid surrounding peaks, was clothed and softened  in the same rose light. He was wondering&mdash;as so many thousands have done before  him&mdash;whether the Red Sea took its name from  this magical aurora, or the less romantic red scum of pelagic fish eggs and  desert dust that so often floats upon it.</p>
<p>His  lazing reverie was broken by the thudding of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs upon the  everlasting sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  on, Jack,&rdquo; shouted his friend and fellow-townsman, Jim Driscoll. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re off at  last. No more sand and sore eyes. The word has come&mdash;it&rsquo;s ship and sea  to-morrow. How do you feel about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even  the thrill of that glad news hardly stirred Hunter. He rose wearily. &ldquo;If it  means the front and fighting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know. I often wonder,  Jim, how the actual thing itself may find some of us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Driscoll. &lsquo;&lsquo;If they&rsquo;ll show us the blighters, we&rsquo;ll do the  rest. Only I hope they&rsquo;re Germans, not Turks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  unlikely,&rdquo; said Hunter, quietly. &ldquo;We happen to be just about where men are  certain to be wanted. It&rsquo;s Constantinople for  a dollar, and we&rsquo;ll be fighting before we know it. How do the chaps feel about  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  fair mad with excitement. The camel meeting has been abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was one of the pleasantries of the desert camp amongst men stale from  overdrill, sullen sometimes in their attitude towards it and to authority.  &ldquo;Never mind, chaps,&rdquo; some cheerful satirist would say, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have races on New  Year&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now  we&rsquo;ll show some of those gasbags and goody-goodies at home whether we&rsquo;re  fighters or wasters,&rdquo; Driscoll exclaimed hotly. &ldquo;The boys are burning for a  chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  chance may be hot enough when it comes to burn in another way,&rdquo; observed  Hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I didn&rsquo;t know you, Jack, I&rsquo;d think you were a grouse. Fighting! God&mdash;that&rsquo;s what  we came for, and we can&rsquo;t get it too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  just the difference in the point of view,&rdquo; explained his chum slowly. &ldquo;I dare  say we&rsquo;ll do pretty well&mdash;most of our fellows will, I swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  as keen for it,&rdquo; said Driscoll, &ldquo;as Bill&rsquo;s old dog for a go at a fox&mdash;and  they&rsquo;ll lick their wounds just as cheerfully afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it. But between ourselves, Jim, and talking as old friends,  I&rsquo;ve often asked myself whether I&rsquo;m the right kind of man to go with them. That  sort of feeling comes mostly in the middle of the night when the wind is up and  the sand swishes on the tent. I wouldn&rsquo;t whisper it to anyone but you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim  laughed. &ldquo;Look here, Jack, are you pulling your own leg?&mdash;for I&rsquo;ll be hanged if  you&rsquo;re pulling mine. I know you, and most of the fellows know you too, and when  it comes to sticking, the closer I am to you the better I&rsquo;ll feel about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  these two talked, the big, buoyant man, Jim Driscoll, splendid embodiment of  health and strength and fitness, the resolute bull-dog type, who never count  odds, whom nothing can daunt; and the slighter, taller, more thoughtful one,  not naturally a fighter, yet fortified by moral courage in a higher form&mdash;a man  in whose nature was a strong spice of sentiment and romance, and who, more  strangely still, was not ashamed to show it. He had yet one other quality which  under stress may be uncertain to a dangerous degree&mdash;a quality which sometimes  exalts the man to a demigod, and occasionally debases him to a cringing slave.  It was Imagination.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Through  the end of the fresh-cut trench in which Jack Hunter lay, again exhausted,  shone the dazzling blue of the Aegean Sea. The  scene and the colour of the scene had changed &mdash;so, too, his emotions. In front  of him a long ascending slope of Spring green, seamed across with scars of  fresh red earth, lifted to a pinnacle that was smoothed and shaped into the  rough landscape&mdash;yet manifestly smoothed by hand, not by Nature&mdash;the escarpments  of a Turkish battery.</p>
<p>He  and his countrymen were being tried out in the red crucible of war&mdash;all the  baser metal of humanity fluxed out of them by fire. Here upon the very doorstep  of a new and dramatic experience they had suffered the ordeal which tries even  the veteran to his last ounce in resistance. For three successive days they had  been fighting and advancing constantly under fire. They found the first day  less trying than Story and Tradition had led them to believe. Their hearts had  thumped a little harder, a little faster than usual&mdash;their arms were so stiff  and tired at night that they knew they must have gripped their rifles very  hard. Their lips had dried often and quickly, though their tongues were always  trying to moisten them. For the first time&mdash;even though they had camped and  drilled in a desert&mdash;they realized the luxury of a water-bottle, while  regretting that it held so little, that it was so often empty when they most  needed it. Yet there was always the comfort of contact, the pride of race which  makes almost every man of nearly every race willing to dare what his mates so  eagerly do. And what splendid fearless fellows all their mates were! How eager  in attack, how indifferent to consequences.</p>
<p>On  the second day, still attacking under fire, Jack Hunter found the strain rather  worse. There was no longer any desire to eat&mdash;the sight of meat was almost  revolting. To talk was an exertion, to think was sometimes a torture.</p>
<p>On  the third day tension had become extreme. Jack Hunter had reached the  questioning stage. Nerves, never before tested to that supreme stage, had  thrilled and tingled so often that composure seemed wholly gone. Most of the  man, and his muscles most of all, craved for rest and recuperation, but nerves  would neither sleep nor rest. Imagination, too, was vividly alert. It was a new  baptism, and the ceremony seemed eternal. As his physical powers weakened  Imagination grew, became distorted, and took possession of him. He had realized  the psychology of battle in all its unexpectedness&mdash;and the unexpected was so  horribly disconcerting. He feared the enemy less than he feared himself, for  all his self-questioning and introspection led inevitably to the one conviction  that, if it happened again, he might funk.</p>
<p><a name="page068"></a></p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300031h-images/page068.jpg" alt="page068" width="538" height="750"></h3>
<p>He  looked around often to his comrade on the left and there, in contact with  strength and courage, found momentary comfort, but not invigoration. Jim  Driscoll&rsquo;s face was rigidly set, not a muscle moved. It was the fighting face  which knows, or seems to know no faltering. As an eruption of earth and smoke  and fire from one of the <em>Queen  Elizabeth&rsquo;s</em> shells leaped high into the air, the fighting face relaxed for  an instant, and Driscoll laughed gleefully, irresponsibly. Never had Jack  Hunter admired anything more on earth, longed for anything so much as the  unmoved, unbreakable spirit of his mate. For time and time again, as he lay  there, the one unspeakable fear came back and took possession of him&mdash;&ldquo;If it  happens again, I&rsquo;ll funk it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  captain came, stooping, running down the trench. &ldquo;Now, lads, get ready,&rdquo; he said,  with a dry hard catch in his voice, from which all resonance and modulation had  gone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to take that ridge, and I want volunteers to cut those wires  at the foot of the slope in about twenty places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  one thing about which Jack Hunter felt profoundly, uncomfortably sure at the  moment, was that he had no intention of volunteering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do it, sir,&rdquo; said Driscoll, eagerly. &ldquo;Me too, Mister,&rdquo; drawled an unemotional  footballer, one of the wasters of the regiment, whose misdeeds in the fields of  sport had been the despair of umpires and stewards. It was very casual,  altogether unheroic.</p>
<p>And  to Jack Hunter came again the supreme test. Impulse, Duty, and Prudence tugged  at him hard, but in different ways. It seemed to him that his captain would  read in his face all his fears&mdash;they were so overpowering that they must be  manifest. Yet with a great moral effort he gasped, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with Jim, sir,&rdquo; and  in the next instant came the conviction that the end of all things was close at  hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  right, my lads, you&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said the captain, and had he followed his  impulse he would have said softly, &ldquo;My children!&rdquo; &ldquo;Take these wire-cutters and  wait for the word. You will be covered by the fire of the ships. Make your dash  as soon as the shells begin to burst on the ridge. And when the way is clear,  wave your arms. Call up the naval station, signaller, and tell them we&rsquo;re  ready. Thank you, boys, and good luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was not long to wait. In a sudden concussion that shook Australian hill the  ships&rsquo; guns opened, and twenty seconds later the crest of Battery  ridge was tossing like a red, rough sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;  shouted the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; yelled Jim Driscoll, less excitedly perhaps  than if he were watching the start for the Melbourne Cup. Hunter was the last to  leave the trench, though in self-punishment he had sworn to himself that he  would be first.</p>
<p>As  he ran down the slope a lesser note of fire began to punctuate the intermittent  turmoil of bursting bombs in front. In his vividly receptive state of mind the  trivial and the awful were strangely blended. For the first time in the three  days&rsquo; ordeal he noticed that there was a double report from rifles fired  towards him, that the &ldquo;bap-bap&rdquo; of the single shot was quickening up into a  ripple, the ripple becoming an unbroken drumming, and that the sibilant sound  that died so quickly behind him was death whispering close to his ear.</p>
<p>Two  of the brown runners checked, crumpled up, suddenly collapsed and were still,  and the thought in Hunter&rsquo;s brain in this long run that seemed never to reach  its goal, was &ldquo;Not one of us will live to get there&mdash;not one. We&rsquo;re done, we&rsquo;re  done.&rdquo; He suddenly realized that he was shouting his thoughts, but that he was  still running towards the wires. Then came a horrible drumming in his ears&mdash;his  temples were not merely throbbing, they were lifting. Fits of violent anger and  abject fear possessed him in turn. He had reached the limit. In this mental  hell which was so much his own imaginative creation, his legs became lead and  his blood turned to water. He wanted to turn and run, run till he reached the  sea, and then swim. The moral power that had kept him moving could sway no  longer. Manhood and patriotism and pride might all go to the devil. He would  run the other way for the sake of that one life which was all he had to live.  What was he doing there, after all? What business was it of his? He half  turned, fell over a wire&mdash;and reaching the objective saved him. The pain and the  drumming and the throbbing never ceased for an instant, but he realized that he  was cutting the wires&mdash; where or how he knew not, but there were loose ends of  wire relaxing and coiling about him. He began to wave his arms. As he waved he  felt a sting across one hand, and from the red weal the blood trickled down his  palm. Looking at it an instant he felt the darkness closing upon him. Then a  great gust of rage, coupled with a sort of self-hate. Was he a girl that this  scratch should so overpower him? It was ridiculous. He knew as a student that  it was only blood fear&mdash;the bane of his race, yet in spite of his knowledge he  was weakening, fainting. But the hand without the bullet mark still waved, and  stopped only when, with a long restful sigh, he rolled over amongst the weeds  at the hill foot. For the bullet which creased his hand had also passed through  his body.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>For  perhaps ten seconds the darkness possessed him, then the light came with a  beautiful stillness. And as the regiment had not yet charged he began  automatically to wave his arm overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  do you do that, Mr. Hunter?&rdquo; asked the Sister who watched and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  we&rsquo;ve got to take the hill,&rdquo; he said wearily; &ldquo;the regiment are coming on. Get  away from here or you&rsquo;ll be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all over,&rdquo; said the nurse. &ldquo;It happened three days ago. You are wounded; and in  hospital; you must keep quiet.&rdquo; She caught the arm which still waved, and held  it firmly down.</p>
<p>He  waited a little while, for the great fear, though less intense, still possessed  him. &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; he asked feebly, &ldquo;tell me the truth. Did I funk it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  laughed. &ldquo;You dear egotist&mdash;you just want me to say how proud we all are of you.  The Brigadier has mentioned you in orders for &lsquo;coolness and daring in a  desperate service.&rsquo; Please rest now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked at her hard, but in the Sister&rsquo;s face was nothing but sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coolness  and daring!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Carnival"></a>Carnival</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>Tarella Quin  (Mrs. Daskein)</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;It  has been a jolly day,&rdquo; said the man, looking between the wet canvas curtains of  the motor launch at the wet trees sliding by, &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  answered the girl. </p>
<p>In  both voices the unemotional note of sincerity trying to convince itself kept  both pairs of eyes on the grey, drooping rain-scape drifting past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow <em>I</em> have enjoyed it,&rdquo; continued the  man, a trifle assertively. He pulled a damp coat collar higher about his ears,  and settled his cap more comfortably.</p>
<p>The  girl moved nearer to him to avoid a patch of damp that was spreading  insidiously along the velvet cushions and, pulling the curtain towards her,  peeped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  will be no carnival to-night,&rdquo; said the man regretfully, &ldquo;a pity&mdash;a great pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the rain has stopped. Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  will come on again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. The clouds are breaking down at the edge&mdash;look! pale grey  through those wet rags! it&rsquo;s hard to remember that there has been a fair day  shining behind all the time. It is clearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll  be no moon though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  the better! She would be fair mad&mdash;&rdquo; laughed the girl &ldquo;&mdash;to see herself eclipsed.  Come and let&rsquo;s roll up the curtains&mdash; the rain&rsquo;s over for a bit, at any rate.  Ugh! how clammy and uncomfortable everything is! But it&rsquo;s over; yes, it is  over. Perhaps a boat or two may hang out a light by-and-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together  they rolled up the wet canvas, slim brown hands and sinewy ones working  swiftly, and the view of the river widened out before them. The leaden water  was transformed to a steel-grey mirror shining with light that gleamed below  the clouds; and far away a few lights winked damply, barely visible yet,  glow-worm points in the soft grey shadows that were settling over Sydney.</p>
<p>The  man took off his cap and leant on the rail beside the girl, conscious of her  vigour, life and youth, though the greyness of the dusk was in her eyes just  now, and the shadows on her sunny head.</p>
<p>Their  faces faded as the darkness crept over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  carnival, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said the man again, indicating the dim houses and  gardens on the steep banks as they glided past, &ldquo;and it was to have been a  great night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  let us hang out our lights, then,&rdquo; cried the girl suddenly. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go home  until I&rsquo;ve had my carnival after this long grey day. Our spirits can&rsquo;t be  quenched by rain&mdash;quick! where are the lanterns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here  they are&mdash;fixed and ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light  them all, then. No, I&rsquo;ll light them and you hang them all around the launch.  We&rsquo;ll go down alone in beauty to Sydney  like a dying swan,&rdquo; laughed the girl, scratching a match and bending over the  glow. It lit her down-bent face with flickering lights that smiled. Pulling the  lantern out to its full length she handed the first yellow globe to the man,  and, as their hands touched, her eyes met his in the lantern glow. Both were  smiling. The light painted curves and shadows full of mirth and revelry where  an hour ago there had been a grave decorum.</p>
<p>One  by one, the incandescent globes trembled out in the darkness, circling the  launch about without illuminating it, and dropping reflections that ran like  melted gold in the moving ripples.</p>
<p>It  was as though a thousand gold-fish swam enchanted about the moving craft.</p>
<p>The  girl sounded shrill defiance upon their siren to wake the attention of the  sleeping river, then, taking the middle stream, they glided through the  darkness. The river heard the call; the sleeping gardens woke and stirred;  houses peeped through winking eyes; and from the tree-crowned heights the great  god Pan looked down, stroking his beard, lost for a moment in reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!  men go mad again to-night,&rdquo; said the god; &ldquo;they chase the gods from Arcadia with mirth and  revelry.&rdquo; He did not raise his reed to his lips, knowing the Syrinx would be  dumb to-night. Its shrill clear fluting could not blend with the &ldquo;broken music&rdquo;  of men&rsquo;s cracked brains. Looking, he was filled with despair. Speechless rage  surged through him, incoherent and wild. Opening his mouth he uttered his  dreadful shout&mdash;that shout that has terrified the world for ages and is heard  but seldom now&mdash;then turned and plunged into the shadows that closed behind him.  Silently faun and dryad slipped away till, in the tree-crowned heights, only  the brownies, sprites and impshies remained. These crept cat-footed amongst the  shadows down to the water&rsquo;s edge and sat grinning, their arms about their  knees. Man&rsquo;s folly found an echo in their own breasts, such being the  sociability of wickedness.</p>
<p>As  the night stirred to life, tiny lights woke as by magic, rippling in a chain of  fire down the gardens to the river&rsquo;s brink, flittering like fire-flies where  the ripples ebbed and flowed. They climbed post and pillar and pergola and  there burst into starry bloom, flinging sprays into the darkness or hanging  festoons that looped and looped, disappearing behind a bend of the river to  reappear in fire-lit trees beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried the girl, leaning out, &ldquo;Oh! <em>oh!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo;  said the man, turning to her and covering her hand that lay on the rail with  his, &ldquo;it were folly to be wise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  look like the Spirit of Carnival!&rdquo; she made answer, bewildered at the change in  him. &ldquo;Were I an artist I would paint you with little wings about you&mdash;at your  heels and on your cap and a torch of flaming fire in your hand!&rdquo; He saw her  mouth laugh and her eyes shining like stars as the golden lantern swung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo; he asked eagerly, staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am Folly. Oh! don&rsquo;t speak a serious word to-night! I am Folly in cap and bells,  painted and powdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you are the mate of the Spirit of Carnival! Mad Folly, be my queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  put his arm about her and the two young faces, with cool cheek laid to  sun-tanned cheek, were lit by the golden lanterns. They leant out, laughing.</p>
<p>Presently,  up the Lane Cove River,  floating, gliding, wafting, crept out a fleet of fairy craft, beautiful with  light, putting out from bay and cove to join the revellers, and sliding over  the water as jewelled dragon-flies might slide, blown by a wanton wind. Once a  boat with lanterns, poppy-red, passed with noise of laughter and song. As they  glided by, the merry revellers lit a red flare that burnt up the night and  turned the water into a running river of fire, showing laughing men and girls  in garments of demon red. They passed away with laughter, and the man and girl  saw the red flare appear and re-appear at intervals along the sparkling river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  spirit of the Tango!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;They were playing Tango music. Oh, how  mad and bad it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  ah, alas, how sweet!&rdquo; added the man.</p>
<p>A  tiny yacht, with all its ropes and rigging spun of yellow light as though a  fire-spider had been busy in the night, blew by with clash of fairy bells,  glass that tinkled low, chimed and rang, and they heard it passing away, a  wandering Spirit of Music, spinning a web of dancing lights about it in the  water.</p>
<p>And  all was beauty without a warring note of harsh electric light.</p>
<p>Flares  that leapt and wavered, little fire-devils, licked about the water&rsquo;s edge,  bending in a dance that writhed and wriggled like a thousand crimson snakes.  Everywhere the mellow gleam of lanterns, the wavering tongues of candles and of  fairy lamps lit the dark night, while the moon caught up the skirts of her grey  domino of clouds before her face, that she might not see the thousand thousand  eyes that mocked her. Deep in the river it was as though &ldquo;tinsel-slippered  Thetis&rdquo; walked with her nymphs below the waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Folly!&rdquo; cried the man, &ldquo;I love you! dearest, be mine for ever. Why shouldn&rsquo;t  you be Folly and I Carnival all our days through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  worshipped her with his eyes, her flushed cheeks, tilted laughing mouth, warm  throat melting into golden shadows, and he saw the mocking laughter on her  face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,  dear Carnival,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;this is the time for mirth and revelry, not love! &lsquo;Colours  seen by candle-light will not look the same by day!&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t spoil it! don&rsquo;t  spoil it, dear, dear Carnival!&rdquo;</p>
<p>More  lights swung out from nowhere, more fairy craft skimmed by; big trembling  lanterns pendant from the ends of curved bamboos showed where small rowing  boats flitted amongst the bigger craft like wills-o&rsquo;-the-wisp slipped out of  elf-land. And the hours chased each other on glowing feet. Where they trod they  left the darkness golden.</p>
<p>Here  and there, where the water had time to calm its agitation, the running lights  merged into molten splashes that lay flat and shining like skate of gold  slithered from a fisherman&rsquo;s creel in a wet market-place; and the next moment  were shattered to a thousand fragments by the passing of a fire-lit  boat&mdash;dancing sparks of gold eluding pursuit, but gathering up its treasure and  running together of itself the next moment to form molten splashes as before  and lie like shining skate in a wet market-place.</p>
<p>Fire  in water&mdash;broken diamonds&mdash;running gold&mdash;the Carnival swept on!</p>
<p>Silent  craft that were beautiful as spectres gliding; mad gay crews possessed by a  spirit that drove them ever on; streams of light fleeing, doubling, and  returning, glittering like water-serpents sporting; music hanging low above the  water; snatches of laughter and of song; a dreaming river wakened and  intoxicated, joining in a wild Bacchanalia to worship the god of revels, its  waters running fire instead of wine, and the trees upon its banks bursting into  sparkling bloom for flowers; youth crowned with joy&mdash;thus swept by the Carnival.  A fairy scene, a cunning scene, a scene of beauty fashioned by Hephaestus! At  last&mdash;oh sad!&mdash;the dancing hours wore their golden slippers through. The fire-spiders&rsquo;  work was over, their shining webs were broken. Glowworms faded one by one and  sank into greyness and the fire-flies closed their wings and showed their fairy  lamps no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear!&rdquo; cried the girl regretfully, &ldquo;the lights are going out&mdash;oh! <em>oh!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  were gaps in plenty now amongst the chains of light; necklaces and festoons  were broken&mdash;many, many links were missing. Lights gleamed and licked and faded,  then burnt low, burnt lower and went out. The little boats, like tired birds,  were going home. One by one they went sailing away and came no more; and at  last the little launch with one lantern burning still, was left alone&mdash;the last.  It, too, was going home.</p>
<p>The  moon dropped her silver domino and looked down. The girl was gazing backwards  along the moonlit stretches of the river that wound into shadows, and the light  of revelry had left her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest,  it is over,&rdquo; whispered the man. &ldquo;Folly and Carnival are gone. Only Love is  left&mdash;the last&mdash;and only Love is wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  said the girl softly, slipping her hand into the big strong hand that sought  it, &ldquo;teach Folly to be wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  the kindly moon hid her face again.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="OceanEggs"></a>Ocean Eggs</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>&ldquo;KODAK&rdquo;  (Ernest O&rsquo;Ferrall)</em></p>
<p>A tall  man sprawled wearily on a deck-chair far at sea and longed hopelessly for eggs.  For some reason, too stupid to detail, he had taken passage on one of  starvation line of steamers trading to Australia, and poor food, regularly  administered by grinning black idiots, had reduced him to a state of semi-starvation.  The longing for eggs&mdash;beautiful, fresh-laid eggs&mdash; had taken hold of his mind in  mid-ocean. The tall yellow funnel that smoked gravely and swayed from side to  side with the blundering hull, reminded him of spilt yolk. The flaky clouds  that slid high overhead, floated down the skies and posted themselves in the  invisible slot on the horizon between the sea and the sky, made him think of  the delicious &ldquo;white&rdquo; that lined the shell. He dozed and half-dreamed of  old-time wrecks from which half-drowned wretches floated ashore on hen-coops.  Hen-coops! If the ancient wind-jammers with their exposed decks could carry  living egg-machines, why couldn&rsquo;t these steamers do it? He struggled out of his  chair with a curse and, jamming his cap over his eyes, went reeling along the  windswept deck to the bridge ladder.</p>
<p>The  first officer, whose watch it was, on hearing the hail at his feet, stopped his  endless promenade and looked down at the angry, sunburned face. &ldquo;Hullo! how  goes it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eggs!&rdquo;  (The wind cut the shout in two, but the listener got the faint small half of  it.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  understand you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  want some eggs&mdash;can&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  we never carry eggs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you carry hens?&rdquo; shouted the red, upturned face. &ldquo;The old windjammers  used to carry hens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owners  too mean!&rdquo; said the first officer. The quartermaster shifted his feet and  fiddled with the wheel. The ship slid forward to a blue abyss and gravely fell  into it. The passenger clutched at the rail, looked upward at the straight  yellow funnel, swore, and staggered back to his chair. The first officer  laughed to himself and resumed his promenade.</p>
<p>Back  on the shadowy main-deck, the tall passenger met a meek-looking man who was  returning morosely from a health-tour which hadn&rsquo;t done him any good. With the  invalid was his dejected little wife. The tall passenger, who had exhausted all  his reading-matter and was bored, started to excite both these people on the  subject of eggs. He had determined to raise a sort of egg-mutiny. He found that  he had acquired two loyal assistants. Ashore, it seemed, the meek-looking man  lived almost exclusively on eggs and medicine. Being without eggs for six weeks  meant that he had to practically exist on medicine alone. With a little  encouragement from the tall passenger and some goading by his wife, he became  quite furious about the lack of eggs. He said he would do what he could and use  his influence, which, so he hinted, was considerable. And the steamer listened  to it all and rolled solemnly on its way. Also the horizon remained a blank. No  land loomed up which might harbor hens.</p>
<p>That  afternoon, when the dreamy, monotonous mid-ocean morning seemed a whole year  astern, the two elderly maiden ladies who had hitherto held aloof from the rest  of the passengers, were introduced into the egg conspiracy by the little wife  of the meek-looking man. They knew all there was to know about eggs, having  managed a hen-farm and actually made a living out of the rash experiment. They  proved over and over again that with reasonably good management the wretched  steamship company could have supplied every passenger with nine fresh eggs  every day and made a profit out of it to boot. This was all written down by the  tall passenger, who was working up the case against the henless ship. When he  got ashore he intended to have a complete torpedo ready which would blow the  company out of the water so far as hen-fruit was concerned. He wanted to  submarine them completely on the question, and hold them up to shame and  ridicule. If he had had anything interesting to do he might not have devoted  himself to the matter; but it was a dull ship&rsquo;s company and the consistent  policy of starving kept his indignation alive. As the days rolled by, the other  passengers drifted into the conspiracy and an otherwise useless young man who  was popularly regarded as half-witted produced a sarcastic egg poem which was  conned with delight. By the time the Westralian coastline showed as a faint blue  stain, the ship&rsquo;s company were united on the subject. Even the elderly  clergyman who suffered from biliousness and dared not look at an egg, was  burning with holy indignation on behalf of everybody else. He explained to  several people that he thought it was his duty to take a part in every  deserving movement, and that the agitation for fresh eggs appealed to his sense  of fairplay. He told the assembled passengers that he considered no sacrifice  too great if it resulted in subsequent travellers getting the fresh food to  which they were entitled. He reminded them that, the voyage being nearly over,  they were fighting (he called it &ldquo;fighting&rdquo;) not so much for themselves as for  those who would come after them. He said it was very noble and high-minded of  them, and they cheered him to the echo. Those who were too old to cheer looked  very stern and mumbled, &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; It really seemed as if such a devoted  band of food crusaders had never before fallen together by chance. When the  meeting broke up, the elderly clergyman said to the meek-looking invalid that  it was a very inspiring movement; and the meek invalid retorted that it almost  made him feel glad that he hadn&rsquo;t travelled on a decently-provisioned ship  where they carried eggs. The tall passenger for his part implied that, the  moment he got ashore, he would have eggs or die in the attempt.</p>
<p>The  steamer with the egg-colored funnel marched steadily in from the outer seas,  and the whole coastline rose up in welcome and advancing lost its blue air of  mystery. It spread out, too, and flowed over the horizon on either side.  Fremantle gradually emerged and dusty foreshores and wharves became visible.  Like the stranger that loses his vagueness and company manners as he develops  into an acquaintance, the place of mystery became a mere seaside town full of  obvious faults. But the eggs were very near now! The tall man&rsquo;s heart jumped as  the first line was hauled dripping ashore and looped over a bollard. He moved  stealthily towards the side and, when the gangway was let down, he leapt  lightly on to the wharf and fled up town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  getting away from the police!&rdquo; screamed somebody, and there was a sort of  half-hearted rush, which stopped foolishly when the supposed absconder was seen  to hold up a passing policeman and gesticulate excitedly. He was asking the way  to the nearest egg-shop. Presently he left the policeman and, climbing into a  cab, told the driver to proceed furiously to the egg-shop address he had got  from the policeman.</p>
<p>A  very bald and serious grocer was staring thoughtfully at the world from between  two cheeses when a perfect stranger fell out of a cab in front of the door and,  rushing in, pointed a finger dead at the third button of his waistcoat. &ldquo;Eggs!&rdquo;  shouted the stranger.</p>
<p>The  bald and serious grocer put both hands on the counter and stuck out his elbows  till he looked like the front section of a manthis or grasshopper. &ldquo;Yes, sir!  Fresh to-day, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  many have you got?&rdquo; demanded the amazing stranger. &ldquo;Er&mdash;let me see now!&rdquo; He held  his chin tightly. &ldquo;Well, I suppose, I have about six dozen, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo;  shouted the stranger, striking the counter with his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! <em>all</em> of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put  them up in a basket at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;can&rsquo;t  I send them for you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!  I&rsquo;ll take them with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  grocer wheeled and called up heavy reinforcements. Eventually three people put  the eggs in a large basket. The stranger paid in gold and, fixing the grocer  with his eye, asked sternly, &ldquo;Now, where else do they sell eggs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>More</em> eggs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  see now. Well, you might pick up a dozen or so at Smith&rsquo;s in the next street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  stranger flitted from the shop to the kerb. &ldquo;Smith&rsquo;s, in the next street,&rdquo; he  told the cabman, and disappeared into the vehicle.</p>
<p>The  cabman opened the slot in the roof. &ldquo;Which Smith&rsquo;s, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  they sell eggs!&rdquo; shouted the fare. The cab drove off and went round the corner  on one wheel. Inside the tall man sat with pursed lips and his arms round six  dozen eggs.</p>
<p>He  felt like a real benefactor when, an hour later, he got back to the ship laden  with nine dozen eggs. He carefully transferred himself and his precious burden  (&ldquo;precious burden&rdquo; in the old books always meant an unconscious female) to the  interior of the egg-less ship with the egg-colored funnel. He sighed gratefully  when he had deposited the enormous basket on the saloon table, and was just  mopping his forehead when a coffee-colored steward sidled expectantly out of  the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See  this basket?&rdquo; he barked.</p>
<p>The  steward craned his neck and goggled his eyes at it. &ldquo;Yes, sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full  of eggs! Everybody on this ship wants eggs, and I&rsquo;ve got them. Now,&rdquo; catching  him by the jacket, &ldquo;I want you to keep enough for me to give me three eggs a  day till we reach Adelaide.  That&rsquo;s about one dozen, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  rest of the eggs are to be given&mdash;divided up, you know&mdash; amongst all the other  ladies and gentlemen. Understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  steward nodded excitedly. &ldquo;Yes, sar! One dozen for you, sar, rest for oder  ladies an&rsquo; gennulmun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  tall passenger nodded and passed him a coin. &ldquo;Right! Now you look after them  for me!&rdquo; He turned away and went off to his cabin to have a wash and a brush-up  after his shore exertions. The basket of eggs stood proudly white on the saloon  table; the retreating steward was a mere smudge in one of the alleyways.</p>
<p>Exactly  fourteen minutes later, the buyer-of-eggs sauntered back to the saloon. He felt  cool and happy, also proud. He expected to be bombarded with the thanks of any  passengers who were aboard and had heard of the good deed. He looked forward  with intense delight to a feast of beautiful fresh boiled eggs, and he thought  he knew how grateful they would be. But, as he approached the basket and the  little knot of passengers who were standing by, he became aware that the air  was charged with suspicion. He glanced again at the group, and that same  instant the elderly clergyman detached himself and shot out of the saloon. He  not only shot out of the saloon, but aeroplaned up the companionway, flitted  across the deck and clattered down the ladder to the wharf, at the imminent  risk of breaking his venerable neck. The egg-philanthropist was just crossing  the saloon to peer out a port after him when he noticed the travelling invalid  shoot a glance of hatred at him over his shoulder. The little wife close at  hand was dabbing nervously at her lips and staring expectantly at him.</p>
<p>A  sudden idea flamed into the mind of the egg-buyer and, without thinking what he  was doing, he jumped at the basket and tore off the cloth cover. One solitary  egg cowered in the bottom of it!</p>
<p>Snatching  up the final trophy, the tall man swung round and confronted the wretched  steward, who had blundered in at the right moment. &ldquo;Have you got <em>my</em> eggs?&rdquo; he  screamed. </p>
<p>The  steward shrank back and went a delicate shade of yellow. &ldquo;No, sar! No, I ain&rsquo;t  got youah eggs <em>yet!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  little woman uttered a scream and dropped a paper bag she had been concealing.  It broke and an enormous mess of eggs sprawled on the carpet like a  spread-eagled octopus.</p>
<p>The  mad egg-buyer snatched up the basket and held it under the steward&rsquo;s nose.  &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he howled, &ldquo;do you see any eggs<em> there?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-n-o,  sar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  basket hit the floor and bounced into the corner. &ldquo;Why, you damned ungrateful  brute, you&rsquo;ve stolen them all! I <em>gave</em> you eggs&mdash;gave you all the eggs you  wanted, and yet you&rsquo;re too damned greedy to leave me a few for myself! <em>Blast</em>  you and your indigestion! I hope they choke you!&rdquo; The steward fell back  spluttering, as the final egg burst terribly on his chin and streamed down over  his white coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h,  sar! I &rsquo;sure you, sar, I nevah touched youah&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  you did, you damned ungrateful thief! You went down on your dirty hands and  knees and asked me to help you to get eggs! Well, I <em>got</em> you the eggs&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  sar, I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut  up, you black brute! You told me you were dying of indigestion, or cold feet or  something! I hope all the eggs you and your friends stole stick in your filthy  throats and choke you!&rdquo; The lady who had dropped the eggs here sat on the floor  and started a fit of hysterics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  sar!&rdquo; began the egg-stained steward, piteously wringing his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SHUT  UP, I tell you! I&rsquo;m going to leave this damned ship! I won&rsquo;t live amongst a lot  of dirty barnyard thieves! If you dare to say another word, I&rsquo;ll kick you  overboard!&rdquo; The tall passenger turned on his heel and stormed out of the  saloon.</p>
<p>The  steward, weeping with fright, turned to the enraged and humiliated invalid  whose wife was sitting and shrieking on the egg-stained floor. &ldquo;Sar, you know,  sar, I speak truth! I ver&rsquo; good man, sar! You know I don&rsquo;t steal eggs, sar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SHUT  UP!&rdquo; roared the invalid. &ldquo;SHUT UP, you black hound! <em>Didn&rsquo;t I see you come into  the saloon and take every egg out of the basket!&rdquo;</em> And then, being encouraged  thereto by the innocent nigger&rsquo;s horror and astonishment, he kicked him  violently with both feet and immediately felt much better.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="TheLittleBrownWoman"></a>The Little  Brown Woman</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>Gertrude Hart</em></p>
<p>They  called her that from her first coming among them, the simple mountain folk.  Whatever she had left behind her of sorrow, sin or tragedy was her own affair.  Something in the steady sweetness of her eyes won their hearts long before she  grew into their lives.</p>
<p>They  fancied that there was healing in the touch of her hands, and her face with its  cheery strength was a good one to look upon, if one lay tossing in fever, or  sick of a mortal malady. She was all brown&mdash;skin and hair and eyes, and if she  had ever been beautiful that was long past.</p>
<p>Just  above the place where two creeks met and foamed about dark rocks her tiny home  perched itself upon the mountain side. Here she lived with her crippled boy, a  strange elfin child whose eyes seemed to hold the wisdom of the ages. For the  rest there were no questions asked.</p>
<p>Humphrey&mdash;  the cripple&mdash;worshipped her with all the force of his twisted nature, and spoke  sometimes to his few acquaintances of wonderful stories that she told when the  moon lay full upon the wooded slopes, and caught the granite boulders, turning  them to silver.</p>
<p>She  had peopled his world with beautiful objects, fairies and knights and dainty  ladies; he would show you where they crossed the ford, and bid you listen to  their laughter.</p>
<p>In  her passion of devotion she resolved that nothing sordid should ever touch  him&mdash;there was a great deal to make up to him.</p>
<p>Inside  the rough house there were many artistic touches, and she grew such flowers as  had never before been seen in the neighbourhood. If an animal fell sick, &ldquo;Ask  the little brown woman to come,&rdquo; they said, one and all; and everywhere faces  brightened at her coming. That was the place she had won, and God knows it had  gone far to heal a mortal hurt.</p>
<p>She  became wise in bush lore as the seasons came and went. The trees flourished in  the tiny orchard, and there was foam of white and pink when spring came  laughing up the valley. Under the log fences that enclosed her clearing ferns  clustered, the hardy sipras and maiden-hair. The beauty of the solitudes crept  into her soul, the birds were her birds; and the grandeur and silence of the  mountains called to her to reach and conquer.</p>
<p>This  is the story of a day when the little brown woman grew tired; and of what came  after.</p>
<p>The  small invalid had been sick unto death, and there were nights of tireless  watching and sleepless anxiety. One morning Humphrey was better, content to  resign himself to the care of a kindly neighbour. Quite suddenly his mother  felt that she must get away from it all for awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take  a day off,&rdquo; the young bush doctor suggested, after one apparently careless  glance at her face. She looked at him almost despairingly, and said simply, &ldquo;I  must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  she set off down the hillside, walking rapidly with never a glance back till  she reached a narrow track that wound its way round a range, thickly timbered  and very rugged. She turned at this point, and it was as though something had  touched an old pain to throbbing activity. She shaded her eyes with her hand,  and in an instant knew that the monotony of her life was to be stirred.</p>
<p>All  that day she wandered. If she was hungry she was scarcely conscious of the  fact; only the bush seemed alive with voices. It was late afternoon when she  realised that she could go no farther, that she must seek shelter. A great  weariness had grown upon her, and with it the helplessness of a very young  child. There were few settlers on these lonely hills, but there were some; she  had only to go to a door and say, &ldquo;I am the little brown woman,&rdquo; and she would  find welcome.</p>
<p>At  length she reached a clearing and a house built of split logs. Like a child she  went towards it, entered the open door, and sank exhausted into a chair.</p>
<p>For  awhile she closed her eyes and lay back. It was good to rest, and the place  felt like home. Then she looked about with a faint smile.</p>
<p>A  man&rsquo;s room, no touch such as a woman&rsquo;s presence always brings even in such  mountain fastnesses as these. She had wandered far indeed, for this must be the  habitation of a man of whom she had heard from time to time. He had lived a  solitary life for years, so the gossips said; a morose recluse who had never  been known to lend a helping hand to anyone.</p>
<p>She  looked at the confusion of books and pipes and guns. Another time she would  have felt inclined to reduce the disorder. Now she was too listless.</p>
<p>Then  of a sudden her heart began to beat in sickening throbs. It could not be  fear&mdash;she had never been afraid of anything.</p>
<p>Someone  was speaking&mdash;a man&mdash;in quick annoyed tones. He resented her intrusion, no doubt.  A big loose-limbed fellow came through the doorway and so looked down upon her.</p>
<p>She  was too tired to do anything but hold out her hands to him&mdash;as if they had never  forgotten the way. There was a sharp expletive, and then one word&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little  puzzled frown contracted her brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  could not know you were here, could I, Geoff? If I had, I wouldn&rsquo;t have come,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  man spoke roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t assure me of that. You even took off your ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  curious sense of happiness possessed her that he had noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  You wanted to go, and I never sought to hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  never ceased to hold. God&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve been punished! It wasn&rsquo;t ever love for her,  Jennie&mdash;just plain beast. Soon over, and bitterly repented of. But I thought I  had tired even your great heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  smiled rather pitifully then, and her head found its old place on his shoulder.  He had forgotten nothing, it seemed, as his rough hands touched her face and  lingered.</p>
<p>Words  had never been his strong point, and they halted now. But his touch brought  magic, and the little brown woman was fast becoming a girl again. Once she put  him from her, and looked into his soul. Then leant back once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  the baby came,&rdquo; she said in low, troubled tones; &ldquo;six years old now, Geoff&mdash;and  a cripple. Our fault, you know&mdash;for I fretted, though I tried not to. Such a  little twisted body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That  was all she said. She had never been one to ask questions; life had taught her  so much wisdom. By and by she would realise the strangeness of the fact that  they had been living their lives all these years with only the hills between.  Now she was tired out, and she was being rested.</p>
<p>She  whispered something to him once, and he took the plain gold ring that had lain  against her heart, and very reverently placed it upon her finger. Sleep&mdash;the  dreamless sleep of utter exhaustion was fast coming upon her; but he was sure  she smiled.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>A Hard Doer</strong><a name="AHardDoer"></a></h2>
<p align="center"><em>E. J. Brady</em></p>
<p>He  rode down to my camp at sunrise, by previous arrangement, and we turned our  horses&rsquo; heads south&rsquo;ard for a week&rsquo;s cattle hunting and sporting in that  unknown country which lies between the Snowy River  and the Victorian border.</p>
<p>The  Hard Doer rode ahead. He wore a faded crepe band around his seedy felt hat. He  might have been in mourning for somebody dead, or the band might have been  habit; but it was plain that either the funeral or the fancy dated back a long  time. Cossack boots, old leather gaiters, a blue shirt, and grey tweed trousers  completed his dress. Inside one of the gaiters was sewn a sheath to carry a  knife. The blade had been much worn by constant sharpening, but its wavy edge  was keen.</p>
<p>Across  his seat the Hard Doer had a cornsack slung for a pack, with the weight of its  contents neatly balanced on each side of the horse. Blanket and hobbles were  buckled on before him. A black billy, which had originally been a  golden-&ldquo;surrup&rdquo; tin, rattled from the &ldquo;dee&rdquo; on the off-side.</p>
<p>The  Hard Doer was anything over 30&mdash;lean, sallow, and weatherbeaten. He had a long  nose, with a slight lean to it; high cheek-bones, and straight black hair. The  skin of his neck was corrugated, and the palms of his hands hard and raspy with  corns. Altogether he looked as if he had been left out in the sun and rain when  he was very young, and the people who put him out had forgotten to take him in  again.</p>
<p>It  was a sunlit, beautiful day. We rode with sparkling sea on one hand and leafy  forest on the other. Sometimes the bridle-track lay close to the edge of the  shore, and one could see the waves breaking on the rocks and rolling back in  clear cascades from slippery cliffs. At other times we entered a belt of  timber, and the shadows of the tall trees enveloped us in a cathedral gloom.  Again, we cantered along a healthy plain or across the hard sands of some  golden beach, where the gulls rose up with harsh complaints when we neared  them.</p>
<p>The  Hard Doer burned strong black tobacco in an ancient pipe.</p>
<p>When  he wakened in the morning he looked round for this pipe, knocked the ashes out,  refilled and relit it. Thereafter throughout the day, except at meal times and  other short intervals, his black teeth were constantly clenched on the stem. He  was a great smoker and a poor talker. We might have ridden seven or eight miles  when he made his first remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shod  &rsquo;orse.&rdquo; Which, with an inclination of the head towards the track, meant that a  shod horse had travelled over it recently.</p>
<p>About  twelve miles out we came to a saltwater inlet running up into the hills.  Clumped tea-tree fringed its banks, and with rushes and tall sword-grass, made  dense thickets along the margins. The Hard Doer cocked his eye at the sun, and  said over his shoulder&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time  to bile the billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  we dismounted, and he took the syrup tin into the thicket, and filled it with  brown, brackish water, such as one gets in these coastal soaks. We spread our  packs out on the grass and opened them. The Hard Doer&rsquo;s pack was a perfect  model of neatness. The man who lives and travels by himself in the bush  generally acquires a military habit. He folds his blanket without a crease,  puts up his tent as if for review, and proceeds like a soldier on the march.  His sugar-bag was made of bed-ticking, one sign of a true bushman; he had  butter in a little earthenware pot, with a damp rag carefully tied over the top  of it; his own scones, enough for a week, were rolled in a flour-bag;  everything, even his bit of household soap, had its own separate bag and place  in the pack, and the things came out in order, were put down in regularity, and  put back after each meal, according to system&mdash;the system of balancing a pack  and saving weight and space.</p>
<p>The  Hard Doer rarely initiated a conversation, and his replies were framed with no  waste of words. He did not throw away speech, or anything else.</p>
<p>We  rode on quietly during the afternoon, great calm and restfulness around us. At  one tidal creek, shallow water was running clearly over seaward sands. The Hard  Doer paused by the hitherward edge, and looked up and down with cautious eye.  Then he got off, handed me his reins to hold, while he undid his boot-laces and  tucked up his trouser legs. As he felt out a safe passage with a pole, I  plunged through the quicksands after him.</p>
<p>The  horses went down over their knees in the treacherous sand; plunged, strained,  and finally floundered out by dint of great effort.</p>
<p>While  this excitement lasted the Hard Doer delivered himself of short, crisp swear  words, framed, I thought, with a view to economic concentration of expression.  They crystallised my own ideas, anyhow; I would have had to take a much more  roundabout track through my vocabulary to reach the same result.</p>
<p>We  got along to our camping-ground in the mystic hour between dusk and dark,  selected a clump of honeysuckle on a tussocky point overlooking the sea, and  relieved the tired horses of packs and saddles. As I swept the ground clear of  rubbish and pitched the tent, my mate groped about in the gloaming, with his  sheath-knife, and cut a good supply of long, dry grass. He spread this out in  the tent for a bed, laid the blankets methodically on top of it, and put the  saddles at our heads for pillows.</p>
<p>It  was now dark, and we had to economise our candles. The Hard Doer piled up dry  firewood by the fire, which he threw on by installments as the blaze lessened,  so that we found the way to our mouths. Our tablecloth was a cornsack laid on  the ground. We had cold boiled bacon, black billy tea, and bread, for  sustenance. For dessert and sundries we filled our pipes. As the good tobacco  smoke curled up the Hard Doer laid back on his elbow, grunted, and remarked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  is what I call comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some  city people might think it tough,&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
<p>He  spat contemptuously towards the fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to take some of &rsquo;em  where it was tough. Like to see &rsquo;em in a snowstorm on Monaro&mdash;they&rsquo;d die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  agreed with him.</p>
<p>The  moon, in its first quarter, went down beyond the trees; the little sea breeze  died out, and the mosquitoes began to put in their fine work. The Hard Doer  brought cow-dung into the tent, tore up the grass with his hands, and made a  clear place for it.</p>
<p>Then  he &ldquo;rose a smoke&rdquo; which filled the six by eight to suffocation.</p>
<p>He  was awake, according to habit, at the white of dawn, and went out to find that one  of the horses had broken a hobble strap, and made back in the night. He swore  in carefully-selected phrases during breakfast time, resaddled, and started on  the trail after the roguish delinquent.</p>
<p>It  was afternoon when he returned to camp, after a ride of 40 miles, driving the  animal before him with his stockwhip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found  him at the rails,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Where did you put my pannikin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With  this the incident closed.</p>
<p>I  spent a week in the bush with the Hard Doer, an instructive week. The only  occasion on which his impenetrability presented an opening was when he shook a  lively four-foot tiger snake out of his blanket. He sprang into the air with a  yell; while I rushed for my shotgun and a cartridge. After I had bagged the  reptile he stood looking at the wriggling remains in a rather shamefaced  attitude.</p>
<p>He  turned the &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; over with his foot and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  the &mdash; did he get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was the only occasion on which I heard the Hard Doer express curiosity about  anything.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="AMemory"></a>A Memory</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>Dorothy  Frances McCrae (Mrs. C. E. Ferry).</em></p>
<p>He  plunged into the gully&mdash;deep into its musk and green coolness.&rsquo; The laughing  water leaped over the stones, singing to the mosses on the tall tree-ferns&mdash;so  tall,&mdash;so scented&mdash; through dim green vistas, where at every turn he suspected a  naiad.</p>
<p>Above  the ferns&mdash;the gums&mdash;up, and up, and up. A heaven of blue. . . . He paused to  listen. Water splashing, stirring leaves&mdash;the crack of the whip-bird. Another  crack, crack, crack! A volley of thunder, and the groan of another forest  giant&mdash;and, above all, a girl&rsquo;s voice, singing. Such a voice! (as he parted the  boughs) such a face! She sat on a log that spanned the water. Hands  clasped&mdash;beauty born of murmuring sound in her face:</p>
<p class="note">The  night has a thousand eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day but one;<br>
  But the light of the whole world dies <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the setting sun.</p>
<p>He  caught his foot on a projecting root and stumbled. The girl did not turn her  head, but ceased singing, and appeared to listen. &ldquo;I startled you,&rdquo; he  volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis  an awkward path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I&rsquo;ve spoilt your song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  only begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks  be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  was not conventional. Emboldened by her excuses, he limped down the bank.  Leaning on his crutches he felt his way carefully along the log. She remained  motionless, and he sat beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May  I sit here and smoke? And will you finish the song for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  if it will please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  wished she would lift her head, and show her eyes.</p>
<p>He  was accustomed to the stare that riveted his shortened limb. The averted gaze  spelt pity. The morbid creature writhed, conjecturing that she had already seen  him through the fern. Scaring a frog with his crutch, he queried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  come here often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  did not look up. Had she, perhaps he had lost the pensive grace of her neck and  those drooping lashes. What a study she would make! If one could paint that  little head of hers &mdash;<em>not</em> on a  background of pale gold, but of green&mdash;cool, haunting, inspiring green!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often&mdash;just  as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  hear you pass. You passed the gully yesterday&mdash;at dusk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  I heard you. You paused and struck a match on the big gum that blocks the  track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witch,  nymph, dryad&mdash;what are you? What forest-sharp ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  mortal sitting at the feet of the Bush, to catch its song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give  me the words. Tell me; I listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I do&mdash;listen! Did you pause to hear the whip-bird and the music of the  creek. It babbles on and on&mdash;morning, noon, and night. On, and on, and on.&rdquo; Her  voice rippled like the running water. With a flowing rush she continued: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you love it, too? The soft whisper of the mosses, the flapping bark, the rustle  of rotting fern (it smells so sweet!) the slip! slip! of the little lizards,  the dead leaves rustling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  prodded with his crutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  turn! What do you see? Tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  see a world of green,&rdquo; he droned. &ldquo;A world of light and shade. Of sunlit fern,  of crystal stream. The stepping stones gleam a rusty gold in the shallows. The  sky, a fainting blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  see a dryad dreaming on a log&mdash;white-robed&mdash;wonderful. I see her head, her face,  her soft elf-locks. Look! See how you quiver in your whiteness. You seem to  shrink aloof from me. From me&mdash;the parody of a man&mdash;the picture out of drawing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  eyes sought her face. It was pale, with trembling lips. On the curved lashes a  tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  he implored. &ldquo;Not pity&mdash;that unmans me. I&mdash; I&mdash;hate pity. I never drivelled  before. Even as a child, not to my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  laid his crutch beside its companion on the log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witch!&rdquo;  he exclaimed whimsically, &ldquo;What spell have you women&mdash;what charm to bind me? . .  . those tears! But the world is full of us; the halt, the lame and the blind &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  me,&rdquo; he burst out; &ldquo;could you (so perfect) love anything not physically  perfect? Answer, Dryad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  could scarcely distinguish her &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; above the splashing of the water. Yet she  said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  love you! Do you think you could learn in time (don&rsquo;t call me mad)<em> in time</em>&mdash;to care for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  rustling fern almost drowned her whisper. But her lips said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&rdquo;  &mdash;he caught his breath&mdash;&ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t looked at me yet!&rdquo; Then she raised her head  and turned her face to his. Beautiful as morning, passionate as night. What  lips, what hair&mdash; <em>what eyes!</em></p>
<p>Wide,  blue, deeply-fringed&mdash;but&mdash;unseeing: What depths of pathos!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good  God!&mdash;you are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  pronounced the brutal word calmly, he shuddering as though in an ague. This  dryad, this beauty he purposed immortalising with his brush. Blind! He, with  his repulsion for anything physically imperfect, linked to a blind mate.</p>
<p>The  water babbled on and on; on and on. The sun pierced the boughs and lit the  shining avenues of living green. The whip-bird rang his note. The lizards  slipped through the fern. Shade lay deep on the distant hills; but silence lay  like a stone between the two.</p>
<p>At  last the girl spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give  me your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  touched each feature lightly, caressingly, letting her fingers linger in his  hair.</p>
<p>Then  she let them fall, whispering, &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Good-bye!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she moaned. &ldquo;I cannot see. But&mdash;your voice, when you said &lsquo;<em>Blind</em>.&rsquo; Go!&rdquo; she sobbed fiercely. &ldquo;Can you not see? It would be  mad. Impossible, not only for us, but for others. The halt and the blind! It is  a dream&mdash;a midsummer madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  finality in her voice smote him&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  dreamed a dream&rdquo;&mdash;her voice took a cadence of deepest yearning&mdash;&ldquo;a dream of  fuller woman&rsquo;s life. Of curly heads&mdash;of cradle songs&mdash;of sudden love&mdash;ah, <em>Go!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  picked up his crutches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  us&mdash;be friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are&mdash;a memory!&rdquo; she answered. He stumbled along the log and up the bank. There  he paused, looking on the picture that should render his name famous&mdash;hereafter. </p>
<p>A  rippling stream with boulders of rusty gold. A background of magic green. The  white-robed dryad of the woods, with eyes bent on the water, gazing, gazing&mdash;</p>
<p>She  heard him pause. Her voice floated up to him, finishing the interrupted song:</p>
<p class="note">The  mind has a thousand eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart but one;<br>
  But the light of a whole life dies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When love is done.</p>

<p align="center"><em>D. Egerton  Jones</em></p>
<p>I turned  the key very quietly in the lock, I didn&rsquo;t want Nell or Jack to know I had done  it: it seems so sentimental and early-Victorian to lock yourself in your room  to cry over your trousseau, and anyway I&rsquo;m not going to cry. I just mean to  have a last little good-bye look at it, but I don&rsquo;t want any of the family  bursting in on me in the unceremonious way they have; they never think of  knocking. For if I did happen not to be able to help just one or two trickles,  they might think I was unpatriotic and a coward and grudged Bob to England.</p>
<p>As  if I ever would. Why, I&rsquo;m proud he&rsquo;s going; I&rsquo;m glad, I tell you, GLAD!  only&mdash;you see we were to be married this month, and perhaps I oughtn&rsquo;t to cry  even by myself, but I never let Bob guess and that&rsquo;s something, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Why,  of course, I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s going, I don&rsquo;t see how any girl could help it, and yet  some of them actually try to stop the men they care for. How can they be so  selfish and disloyal? I couldn&rsquo;t have urged Bob to fight if he hadn&rsquo;t wanted  to. I&rsquo;m not heroic enough for that, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have held him back for  anything in the world. And yet this afternoon Perle Harden admitted to us all  that Dick wanted to go and she wouldn&rsquo;t let him; she&rsquo;d begged him not to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help it, Cecily,&rdquo; she pleaded, when I went for her. &ldquo;There are plenty of  other men to go and Dick&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got. I couldn&rsquo;t live without him. I just  can&rsquo;t let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other  girls are sending all they&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; I said, in a kind of white rage; &ldquo;why  should you save your happiness over the dead bodies of ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  that&rsquo;s what it amounts to, doesn&rsquo;t it? Every woman who stops her lover or her  son going is saving him at the expense of some other woman, for almost every  man that goes leaves a hole in some heart.</p>
<p>All  she&rsquo;s got and she couldn&rsquo;t live without him! Why, isn&rsquo;t Bob all I&rsquo;ve got, too,  and oh! to think of life without him now! But that&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s affair, not mine.  And when he told me he wanted to go, that Mother England needed men and he  thought his first duty was to her even before me, and would I mind very much?  thank God, I never hesitated a second. I put my arms round his neck and said,  &ldquo;Mind! Why, I&rsquo;m proud to give you to her. But &mdash;Bob&mdash;I&mdash;I want you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  I <em>am</em> proud, only sometimes at night  when I try to picture a battlefield after the storm of shrapnel and bullets,  and think of the torn and huddled things on the ground&mdash;and one of them may be  my Bob!&mdash;but I never tell those thoughts to him; he must always remember me  proud. But oh, Bob darling, darling, I love you so, and we were going to be so  happy.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t  love queer? Why one person should be so much more to you than the rest of the  world. I love just everything about Bob, his hair and the funny little way his  eyebrows kink up, and even his dear old prickly face when he wants a shave. And  to think just a stray bullet or a bit of shell and &ldquo;the Secretary of War  regrets&rdquo;&mdash;and year in and year out there will be me just the same, nothing will  happen to me&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Death&rsquo;s  queer, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean for those who die, but for the rest of us. It  seems now as if Bob couldn&rsquo;t go out of my life like that&mdash;but I daresay all  women who love feel the same, and some of them can&rsquo;t return.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s  coming to-night to say good-bye. They leave to-morrow and in a minute I must change  my dress, but somehow I felt before I said good-bye to him I wanted to say  good-bye to all my pretties, all the things I&rsquo;d gathered together to make  myself and the house that&rsquo;s a-building beautiful for him. Perhaps I <em>am</em> early-Victorian, but&mdash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll  take my house things first. They do look so cosy, all folded up in neat little  piles. There&rsquo;s all my kitchen towels, plain gray ones for the crockery, and the  glass ones with their natty red checks, and even dusters, too. And how cool and  lovely the linen sheets feel. I was going to keep them so white. I love nice  linen.</p>
<p>I  hemstitched the tablecloths myself. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to let the shops do it: and  just beneath are my damask face-towels. I crocheted the lace for nearly all of  them. And here&rsquo;s a tray cloth Nell worked for me the first week Bob and I got  engaged. Oh, wasn&rsquo;t it a happy week. I knew Bob was going to ask me and yet  somehow when he did&mdash;it was all different and heavenlier than I&rsquo;d thought it  could be. Hush, Cecily, you mustn&rsquo;t start thinking back like that, you just get  on and say good-bye to the tray cloths; here&rsquo;s a dozen and a half d&rsquo;oyleys all  waiting to have a last little pat. Such pets some of them are too. I can just  see how they&rsquo;d look with the cake and biscuits nestling in them on my days at  home&mdash;putting on lots of frill! Oh, you dears, go away quick or&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m not  crying really, but I might if I looked at you any longer.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2300031h-images/page118.jpg" alt="page118" width="650" height="517"></p>
<p>And  here&rsquo;s the cushions that were going to make our study so cosy. Bob loves  cushions, he&rsquo;s an old Turk, he just loves to have his head on one, his feet on  another and a third poking him somewhere in the back. They&rsquo;re brown for the  study and here are two pink ones that were for my room. I love pink. And the  house is nearly finished, too. I saw it yesterday as we drove past. We shall  have to let it now, I suppose: it will spoil it to stand empty, but how I hate  the thought of anyone else in our house. We&rsquo;ve planned it so carefully, and  fought over it with the architect and argued and dreamed of it together till it  seems a bit of Bob and me, that they will be spoiling.</p>
<p>Ah,  well, maybe I&rsquo;d better turn to my own things now&mdash;the dear lacy piles, and, I  can&rsquo;t help it, I must kiss my breakfast caps; they are such darlings. Bob is  certain I couldn&rsquo;t ever look prettier than I do, but I used to say wait till he  saw me in a breakfast cap with a little pink rosette over one ear and rosebuds  over the other, and he would say&mdash;there, away you go, with a kiss inside each of  you from me instead of the ones Bob would have given you.</p>
<p>These  in this softest tissue are my wedding set. I hadn&rsquo;t ordered my frock yet, but  all my under-things are ready even to my shoes and stockings. Yes, you are  lovely, dear wedding clothes, even if I shall never wear you now. God! will it  be never&mdash;I wonder&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Jack  came just now and rattled the handle of my door. He called out that Bob is  coming up the path. I have put them on, my wedding things, the shoes and  stockings and the rest. But I have only an ordinary frock on top and they will  never guess, not even Bob, that underneath I am a bride. Perhaps it is silly,  but &mdash;well, you see I want to. I guess I haven&rsquo;t any other reason.</p>
<p>There,  lid, down you go and round goes the key. I can hear Bob&rsquo;s voice in the passage.  Am I all right, mirror? I wonder will he notice my shoes, he generally does,  and they are so dainty, but I shall not tell him they are my wedding ones. He  mightn&rsquo;t understand. He might think I&rsquo;m regretting already. He&rsquo;s going  to-morrow and I want him, oh I want him, but&mdash; I guess England wants him more, so&mdash;  &ldquo;Coming, Bob.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Jonathan"></a>Jonathan</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>Marion Miller  Knowles</em></p>
<p>Jonathan  Morris, J.P., sat on his back verandah, smoking,&mdash;a scowl on his brow, and his shirt  sleeves rolled up.</p>
<p>He  was in a bad humour, and the soothing weed he smoked had not had time to take  effect.</p>
<p>Two  tramps he had turned away supperless the previous evening had, in revenge, set  fire to three of his largest haystacks after the household had gone to rest for  the night; and, as misfortunes rarely come singly, he had been obliged that  morning to shoot a favourite mare which had broken her leg.</p>
<p>A  cockatoo was strutting up and down on a perch beside Jonathan, its crest  raised, and its knowing eyes watching him, as if it scented the coming of a  storm.</p>
<p>From  inside, came the sound of scrubbing, sometimes broken by a girl&rsquo;s voice singing  snatches of old songs.</p>
<p>The  singing, though it seemed part of the bright, sunny morning, evidently jarred  on Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nell!&rdquo;  he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nell!&rdquo;  shrieked the cockatoo, flapping its wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  owner of the pleasant voice appeared in the doorway&mdash;a pretty, but  scared-looking girl of twenty-one.</p>
<p>Jonathan  pointed with his pipe to a figure in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  young man who fools after you, is riding across the paddocks. There&rsquo;s plenty  work for you inside, my girl, so keep hard at it! I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; to say to  that there young man, which I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to git off my chest right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get  inside, young woman! Your father wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday! No daughter o&rsquo; mine  will stand foolin&rsquo; round like a motherless calf in <em>my</em> house. You can do what you  like when you go to his&rsquo;n!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  broke into a loud, coarse laugh, which the bird echoed&mdash; swaying backwards and  forwards in ludicrous imitation of his master&rsquo;s corpulent form.</p>
<p>Nell,  white to the lips, retired&mdash;out of sight, maybe, but not out of sound of  hearing. Her father had never favoured Ted Anderson&rsquo;s suit, but, so far, he had  refrained from openly insulting him.</p>
<p>The  rider by this time was close to the house, whistling gaily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Off to Philadelphia in the  Morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan&rsquo;s  thin lips set in harder lines. He watched Anderson  grimly as he cantered up to the gates, went round to the yard, and tied up the  horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  it&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t turn his skinny old moke into my stable, an&rsquo; feed him  on my oats! Aint worth more than &pound;5, that horse&mdash;an&rsquo; dear at that! You have your  p&rsquo;ints, Mr. Edward Anderson, but you know no more o&rsquo; horse-flesh than a suckin&rsquo;  calf! I can&rsquo;t abide these dapper city fellows, with their polished ways. I&rsquo;ll  let him know what Jonathan Morris, J.P., thinks of him before he&rsquo;s an hour  older!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  young man,&rdquo; drawled Jonathan, in a strong nasal tone, as Ted made his  appearance and bade him a hearty good morning, &ldquo;an&rsquo; what may you be wantin&rsquo;,  this fine day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I just thought I&rsquo;d ride across to see how you were getting on, and how the  wheat was looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  leaned against the verandah post, a good-natured smile on his face&mdash;his dark  eyes wandering the while to the dining-room, at which he thought he had caught  a glimpse of his sweetheart&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Jonathan  folded his hairy arms across his chest, screwed up his lips derisively, and  gave a harsh laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  you didn&rsquo;t come to see how I was adoin&rsquo;, not you!&mdash; nor to see how the wheat was  gettin&rsquo; on, Mr. Fair-and-easy! You came down here to see my daughter, young  man! Howsomever, she&rsquo;s got something more to do of a morn than waste her time  talkin&rsquo; to young men. Just you sit down again on the bench, Mr.  High-an&rsquo;-mighty. What&rsquo;s good enough for Jonathan Morris, J.P., is good enough  for you, I suppose? Old Jonathan may be as rough as they make &rsquo;em, but, for all  that, he&rsquo;s thought more of in this here district than some folk that hold their  heads higher, with a dashed sight less in their pockets! Some there be who&rsquo;d  like to make a cat&rsquo;s paw of the daughter&rsquo;s hand to reach the old man&rsquo;s cash-box&mdash;eh,  Poll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  made a facetious dive at the cockatoo with his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;  &rsquo;E don&rsquo;t know where &rsquo;e are!&rdquo; cried the bird, putting its head on one side, and  sidling out of his reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!  ha! ha!&rdquo; roared Jonathan, &ldquo;the cockatoo is right. &lsquo; &rsquo;E don&rsquo;t know where &rsquo;e are&rsquo;  who goes adoin&rsquo; that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.  Morris!&rdquo; cried Anderson,  springing to his feet; &ldquo;are these insinuations meant for me? Do you dare to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call  &rsquo;em what you like, Mr. Edward Anderson, as long as you answer me this here  question fair an&rsquo; straight&mdash;do you want my daughter or my money-bags?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither  man noticed the flutter of skirts at the dining-room door.</p>
<p>Anderson&rsquo;s face had grown bloodless. Even hardened old  Jonathan quailed before his blazing eyes and the torrent of wrath which poured  itself out in a lava of indignant words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan  Morris, insult after insult have I borne at your hands for the sake of your  daughter, but now the time has arrived when to sit quietly and listen to your  coarse taunts would be but a cad&rsquo;s part. I want none of your money-bags! I  would scorn to touch a farthing belonging to you! I would not change with the  mean, petty soul in your body for all the gold in Australia. I want to marry your  daughter, it is true, but I am able and willing to work for her&mdash;ay, and I have  worked for her these three years past&mdash;and I defy any man in this district, or  out of it, to throw a stone at me as far as character is concerned. You can  keep your greasy money-bags, Mr. Jonathan Morris, and much joy may they bring  you!&mdash;but, believe me, if your daughter loves me as I love her, neither you nor  all the fathers in the Commonwealth will manage to keep her from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  figure appeared for an instant on the threshold of the dining-room, then drew  hastily back again.</p>
<p>Jonathan  gazed at the irate personality before him with a peculiar gleam in his small,  shrewd eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  oft pestered with foxes o&rsquo; nights, when honest folk&rsquo;s abed&mdash;are you a protector  of the varmint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,  your age protects you! I shall not come as a thief in the night, to run away  with your daughter! Never fear&mdash;I shall not cross your threshold again. Nell is  of age; she must choose between us. It is true that I came to see her only. You  forbid me to do so, for no reason whatever&mdash;save the paltry one of my being a  much poorer man than yourself. I wish you good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anderson strode off the verandah, his broad shoulders thrown  back proudly. Stalwart, honest, and capable he looked. A man of reason might  have been proud of such a prospective son-in-law.</p>
<p>Ted  was half across the yard, when there was the rush of a flying, gray-clad figure  over it, and a cry of &ldquo;O, Ted, Ted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before  Anderson had  time to turn round, Nell Morris, weeping bitterly, was beside him.</p>
<p>Jonathan  was following her leisurely. Nell gripped her lover&rsquo;s arm, and faced her father  determinedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  choose now, father!&mdash;now&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan  put his pipe between his lips, and began to light it slowly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  choice aint a bad &rsquo;un, either, young woman! You&rsquo;d better ask your young man in  to dinner. I don&rsquo;t bear no enmity. He has his p&rsquo;ints; he (puff! puff!)  has&mdash;his&mdash;p&rsquo;ints!&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">Dramatic Sketch for Two Characters</p>
<p align="center"><em>Arthur H. Adams</em></p>
<p>SCENE:  Mrs. Chester&rsquo;s <em>drawing-room, pretty,  middle-class. Window up C. Telephone on Table, C. Several photographs of a  young man on the wall and about the room. Afternoon.</em></p>
<p>MRS.  CHESTER, <em>middle-aged, dressed in deep  mourning, is gazing out the window. She turns, with a weary gesture, comes  down, picks up a photograph in frame, of the young man, and puts it down with a  suppressed sob:</em> Dead! Killed in the trenches. My son!</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> MRS. MORDAUNT<em> (in calling dress,  same age.)</em></p>
<p>MRS.  M. <em>(swims up to</em> MRS. CHESTER, <em>takes her two hands silently in hers)</em>:  Oh, my poor dear! How dreadful!</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Yes, it&rsquo;s true. I got a cable two days ago.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: I only saw it in to-day&rsquo;s paper. Killed in action! Your only son! Poor  Jack! My boy was dreadfully cut up when he saw it this morning. <em>(Inquisitively)</em>: But the paper didn&rsquo;t  give any details. I thought that you&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: There are no details. There never are. Just three grim words, &ldquo;Killed in  action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: Then you don&rsquo;t know how he died?</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Bravely, I know. And that is all I know.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: But was he shot, or&mdash;?</p>
<p>MRS.  C. <em>(shudders)</em>: Bayonetted, or smashed  to pieces by a shell? I don&rsquo;t know. I hope I shall never know.</p>
<p>MRS.  M. <em>(disappointed)</em>: Oh! You&rsquo;d think  the General would at least have the politeness to tell you, his mother. But  your boy! To be taken like that!</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: He died fighting for his country, and his country needed him. What finer  death could he have wanted?</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: I see. You&rsquo;re right, Alice.  If one has to die, Jack was lucky in having such a glorious death.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: I never thought of glory. And I&rsquo;m sure Jack never did.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: That makes it all the finer. But I&rsquo;m more than ever glad, after this, that <em>my</em> boy didn&rsquo;t volunteer. My only son!</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: So was poor Jack.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: Of course. But that makes it all the more awful that you could allow him to  go.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Should I have stopped him?</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: I stopped my son.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Though you knew every man was wanted at the front?</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: Well, there were plenty of others who should have gone before Cecil. But I  had a dreadful time stopping him. He was mad to enlist; said it was his duty to  enlist. I told him that his duty lay at home, with his mother. There are plenty  of large families of boys where one or two wouldn&rsquo;t really be missed. But I  have only one.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: So had I, and now I have none.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: Don&rsquo;t tell me that you couldn&rsquo;t have prevented him going.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: How could I? <em>(Breaking down.)</em> No;  I can&rsquo;t keep it up any longer. Oh, Julia, he&rsquo;s dead now; nothing will ever  bring him back now. I don&rsquo;t know even if he was buried, nor where he died. I  shall never know even where he was buried, never see his grave. Nothing to  remember him by, except memories. And there is one memory too bitter to bear. I  must tell you, Julia. I must tell someone. Else I&rsquo;ll go mad. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Jack didn&rsquo;t want to enlist. I  made him.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: You, his mother!</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Yes, because I was his mother.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: You sent him to his death! Alice!</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: No; not to his death. Death is everywhere. Death took his only sister when  she was only a tiny baby. But in a time like this what use is life? What right  has any man to his own life when his country demands it? Why, all it is worth  is to be thrown away; my boy&rsquo;s great body was meant only to stop a bullet so  that our men could go on over his body to victory. That is what we women bear  and bring up our children for. All the long years of care and worry&mdash;just for  that! Oh, yes, the thought of death was behind all my pleadings with him, but  could I be a coward, too? If my life was of any use to stem that grey tide of  brutality that is sweeping over us, don&rsquo;t you know I would willingly give it?  But they don&rsquo;t want women&rsquo;s lives: they only want their sons, they only want  their hearts. If it meant Jack&rsquo;s life or mine, do you think I would have  hesitated? But they only wanted him. So I gave him. I sent him to his death.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: God forgive you, Alice.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: God forgive me, yes! That night he came home so unexpectedly from the camp,  and told me he had just two hours to spend with me before he said good-bye! The  transports were going out at dawn. I said good-bye to him without a tear,  because I could not let him see that I was a coward. But I cried all that  night. And I got up before the day broke, and went down to Cremorne Point to  watch the transports go. It was raining. There was just a tiny group of us, a  sad little group, with umbrellas, watching in the grey rain. Mothers, sisters,  wives, sweethearts! We were too far off even to recognise our own boys in the  crowd on the decks and in the rigging. And so we watched the transports go,  silently, sombrely, without a cheer. Off to the front&mdash;and sneaking out like  that into the grey curtain of the rain! But we waved, and a thousand arms waved  back to us; and then we cheered&mdash;a feeble little women&rsquo;s cheer, from throats  that were worn out with sobbing&mdash;such a pitiable cheer! But they cheered back, a  great, rousing cheer&mdash;our big sons! Our great brave boys! But no, we didn&rsquo;t see  them like that. A mother couldn&rsquo;t. No; they were just our little tiny toddling  sons, our little baby sons, lying in their little white cots, lying warm in the  bed beside us, our little helpless bits of new life! Our babies!</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: And you could send him away!</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Of course it hurt, dreadfully, in the long nights after he had gone. But I  was proud, too. I had given my boy for his country, and surely God knows how  hard that is for a mother! And after the weeks of weary waiting the days when  his letters came! The little crisp letters, saying so little, telling me so  much! I&rsquo;ve got them here. So few! You know he didn&rsquo;t want to go till I  persuaded him. Well, in his last letter he says <em>(picking up a letter from the little pile on the table)</em>. No; I  needn&rsquo;t read it: I know it by heart. &ldquo;Mumsie&rdquo;&mdash;silly baby! he always called me  that. &ldquo;Mumsie, I&rsquo;m so glad now that you made me go. You&rsquo;ve given me my chance  to prove I&rsquo;m a man. You showed me the way, Mumsie. I can&rsquo;t imagine now how ever  I could have hung back. Fancy you having to persuade me to go! Mumsie darling,  there&rsquo;s a lot of brave fellows on board, but none so brave as you. And, because  you believe in me, remember always, Mumsie, I&rsquo;ll never disgrace you.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s  all, except something about the socks I made for him. He says there never were  such socks.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: Oh, Cecil is brave enough, too. He was frightfully eager to go. Why, when I  forbade him, he actually went off and enlisted. But he was under age, so I saw  the officer and refused my consent. And they had to give him back to me. And  now that I&rsquo;ve got him safe, they&rsquo;ll never get him again. I&rsquo;m thankful that I  saved him from&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: From death, yes.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: I&rsquo;m glad you see that, Alice.  I&rsquo;m glad you know what you have done. I always thought you were a hard woman, a  prideful woman.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Me! Oh, not now!</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: No; because God has punished you for your presumption. He has taken your  son from you because you did not cherish him enough, because you sent him from  you to this dreadful war. I see in this the Hand of God. He gave us our sons to  keep from harm&mdash;not to send them to their death. But, of course, I can&rsquo;t expect  you to see how presumptuous you&rsquo;ve been.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Oh, but I do see it&mdash;now that he is dead.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: Perhaps that is why he was taken&mdash;to punish you. Oh, Alice, that is how I hope you will look on  this awful thing. As a lesson against presumption.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Yes, Jack is dead. I sent him to his death&mdash;just that&mdash;his death. His  terrible, lonely death. I try to keep it up &mdash;to pretend that I&rsquo;m proud; but I  can&rsquo;t, Julia, I can&rsquo;t. I see now I&rsquo;ve been wrong&mdash;and nothing I can do will ever  set it right. I shouldn&rsquo;t have let Jack go. I shouldn&rsquo;t have made him go. And  now he&rsquo;s dead, in the trenches . . . somewhere out there . . . . in some  trivial forgotten fight . . . dead . . . the living happiness that was my great  boy . . . dead. And I can&rsquo;t keep up my pride any longer. I killed him. I forced  him to go. I&rsquo;m Jack&rsquo;s murderer.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: I&rsquo;m glad that you see it now. I&rsquo;ve always thought you were too proud.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Oh, Julia, don&rsquo;t say that. Surely I&rsquo;m humble enough now&mdash;a childless woman  who murdered her baby! <em>(Telephone rings.)</em> Oh! <em>(She goes to it.)</em> Yes. This is  Mrs. Chester&rsquo;s house; Mrs. Chester speaking. . . . Yes, Mrs. Mordaunt is here  now. You want to speak to her? (<em>To</em> Mrs. Mordaunt): Julia, it&rsquo;s someone who wants you. . . . No; they don&rsquo;t want  you. It&rsquo;s just a message, I think. I&rsquo;ll take it. . . . Yes? . . . Oh? . . . No!  No! . . . (<em>To</em> Mrs. Mordaunt) : Wait:  I don&rsquo;t understand. <em>(To telephone)</em> :  Tell me again! . . . Bringing him home? . . . You&rsquo;re ringing from Mrs.  Mordaunt&rsquo;s house? He&rsquo;s there now. Wait. I&rsquo;ll tell her. (<em>To</em> Mrs. Mordaunt) : Julia, there&rsquo;s been an accident. A dreadful  accident. It&rsquo;s Cecil, your boy Cecil. They&rsquo;ve brought him to your house. They  want you to go home at once.</p>
<p>MRS.  M.: Cecil! An accident! Is he hurt?</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Yes, in an accident. (To telephone): Hullo! Tell me&mdash;is&mdash;he&mdash;is he&mdash;? . . .<em> (drops telephone)</em>. He&rsquo;s killed. Dead. Run  over by a motor car. Dead.</p>
<p>MRS.  M. (drops into a chair): Oh, my boy! Cecil! No; it can&rsquo;t be. There&rsquo;s some  mistake. Why, Cecil&rsquo;s at the cricket match. He went off so happily this  afternoon. He couldn&rsquo;t be dead so soon.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Go, go at once. It might be your only chance. I&rsquo;ll come with you. <em>(Tries to assist her to her feet.)</em> I  know what it is to have a son killed.</p>
<p>MRS.  M. <em>(sitting dazed)</em>: Dead! Dead so  quickly, so easily! No, no! Death couldn&rsquo;t come to Cecil like that.</p>
<p>MRS.  C.: Death is everywhere. <em>(Ecstatically.)</em> Your son run over by a motor car going to a cricket match! My son, killed in  action for his country! And you kept your boy at home for that! And I sent mine  to the front. I sent him! Thank God I sent him!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why  will yeh admit it at all?&rdquo; asked his daughter impatiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afther tellin&rsquo;  yeh times out iv mind &rsquo;tis nadeful to be triumphant &rsquo;n gay wid the people iv  the great cities. Wanst they think yeh beat, man, never a wan iv them but will  take a shtick to yeh. Have sense, will yeh no&rsquo;? The one what confesses he&rsquo;s  beat is always beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cragan&rsquo;s  right hand rummaged under his hat, and he grinned lugubriously. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very well  an&rsquo; all what yer sayin&rsquo;, me gir-rl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would brave talk make good  eatin&rsquo;, but here I am three days, &rsquo;n&rsquo; never a job offerin&rsquo; wan way or the  other, &rsquo;n&rsquo; the rint &rsquo;cumulatin&rsquo; manewhile, &rsquo;n&rsquo; me few thriflin&rsquo; shillin&rsquo;s  dwindlin&rsquo; out, &rsquo;n&rsquo; five shmall childther waitin&rsquo; to shtarve on me.&rdquo; Cragan  pushed his hat to another angle, and continued the exploration with his left  hand. His thick, reddish hair yielded no inspiration. &ldquo;I donno, I donno,&rdquo; he  said hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  well, Michael Cragan,&rdquo; said stout Norah, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no one dead yet, nor dyin&rsquo;  nayther, for the bite or the sup. Ate a little &rsquo;n&rsquo; thry again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t  I afther thryin&rsquo; agin&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; agin, &rsquo;n&rsquo; wanst more, &rsquo;n&rsquo; findin&rsquo; niver a wan nadin&rsquo;  a tall man can swing a pick, put up post &rsquo;n&rsquo; rail finces, build a well, fell  threes, plough, quarry, &rsquo;r wash a prospect wid any livin&rsquo;. Begor, Norah,  they&rsquo;re all arnin&rsquo; meat &rsquo;n&rsquo; dthrink here sitting up on a shlim shtool wid a pen  to their fisht, makin&rsquo; great calculations, a thing no Cragan was good at iver,  sinst the days iv Noah.&rdquo; Michael had his two talons in his hair now.</p>
<p>Norah  wound a plump arm about his neck. &ldquo;Tut, tut, &rsquo;tis early yet. Yill do well  enough, but &rsquo;tis not cunnin&rsquo; t&rsquo; talk iv well-sinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; ploughin&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo; fellin&rsquo;  down terrible threes here in Melbourne.  Would they be irrectin&rsquo; post-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-rail finces &rsquo;long Collins Shtreet, d&rsquo;yeh  think? Would yeh have them dig a roarin&rsquo; gold mine befure the Posht Offis, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  shtart a two-horse puddler on the fut-path right forninst the Town Hall dure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;  &rsquo;Tis a millin&rsquo; man I am, me darlin&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a fine digger be taste &rsquo;n&rsquo;  inclination, &rsquo;n&rsquo; me almost bor-rn wid a prospectin&rsquo; dish to me fist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;  &rsquo;N&rsquo; great good it done you, year in &rsquo;n&rsquo; year out, messin&rsquo; in the sludgy cricks,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; diggin&rsquo; yer poor, silly goold mines on the flats, &rsquo;n&rsquo; searchin&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo;  searchin&rsquo; ever be the dar-rk hills &rsquo;n&rsquo; findin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; would kape a shoe to the  fut &rsquo;r a fair heft iv praties in the bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cragan  sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not have left it in twinty year did yeh not drag me off, me jool,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Though &rsquo;tis true I did shmall good be it fer mesilf &rsquo;r them loved me.  Hersilf had the har-rd life wid me, rest her soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,  there, be consoled, will yeh? Me mother was contint wid yeh, Michael Cragan, if  her divil iv a dauther was not.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Norah  took off her father&rsquo;s hat, and tried to smooth his rebellious hair. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be  as profitable to attempt to pat a bed of sofy springs into decent seeming,&rdquo; she  commented.</p>
<p>But  Michael was not to be reassured with the laying on of hands. He had regarded  the adventurous excursion from his native hills to the city with dire  misgivings, and experience was justifying his blackest forebodings. He could  get no work in Melbourne.  There seemed to be no field here for his peculiar talents, and nowhere in sight  was there a bit of a &ldquo;crick&rsquo;&rsquo; where, in dire extremity, a man could fossick for  a few grains of gold to provide immediate necessities.</p>
<p>Never  before had Michael James Cragan been quite out of touch with &ldquo;the bit of  fossickin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Always there had been a morsel of &ldquo;wash&rdquo; or a few yards of  &ldquo;slurry&rdquo; with golden potentialities which Michael, senior, with the able  assistance of Michael, junior, could put through the cradle or the sluice box,  with the certainty of panning out a reasonable meal.</p>
<p>Here  in town one was cut off from all sources of supply. Here was no field of  &ldquo;praties&rdquo; a man might levy on in a case of emergency, here were no stray  lambkins frisking on the hills of which a man might take surreptitious toll  when the &ldquo;mate hunger&rdquo; was strong upon him. His native wilds in the auriferous  heart of Bungaree had never withheld succor, and through it all was the  vivifying hope of the gambler, the old digger&rsquo;s chance of hitting it rich, of  coming on another &ldquo;jeweller&rsquo;s shop&rdquo; in the sparse alluvial of Gravel Flat, or  cutting a two-ounce reef in the neighbouring hills, already considerably  scarred with his neat trenches.</p>
<p>From  this simple, hopeful, half-vagrant life Norah&rsquo;s insane ambitions, Norah&rsquo;s  absurd craving for respectable order, and fixed meals, and the felicity of a  regular fifty shillings a week, had torn him. From the ever-sustaining  possibility of a successful flirtation with Fortune, he had allowed his  daughter to inveigle him to this suburban wilderness of asphalt and macadam  infested with a curious sort of little fat men&mdash;slaves of the gamp&mdash;and inflicting  him with the dire emotions of a poor, shipwrecked sailor cast upon a barren  island.</p>
<p>Another  week went by, and still Michael Cragan was hunting the elusive job. Ere this  Norah had been taught by experience that it was not wise to take the first sum  offered by Moses Cohen at the sign of the Three Gilded Pills in Smith Street on  articles of domestic use. She had learned, after several ventures, that Moses  Cohen, as the proprietor of a pawnshop, really desired to take things in pawn,  and was not merely conducting the business because it hurt his pride and  irritated his family, as she at first imagined. Realising this great truth,  Miss Cragan was now able to negotiate for the full value of such security as  wedding rings, parlor ornaments, and kitchen ware.</p>
<p>But  the hope that had flowered in roseate blossom in the soul of Miss Cragan when  the family came to town was now faded, and the bloom hung desponding heads on  limp stalks. At the same time, too, the roses were paling from her cheeks, and  the little devil of gaiety no longer played peck-a-boo in the pretty dimple  situated half-an-inch from the left hand corner of Norah&rsquo;s handsome mouth. It  was from sad contemplation of these things that Michael fled into his backyard  on that memorable Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Michael  raked his prospector&rsquo;s kit out of the woodhouse, spread the articles on the  grass, and stood over them, rubbing up the hair under his hat in pathetic  perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  dunno!&rdquo; said Michael Cragan. &ldquo;I dunno! I dunno at all, no I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah  came from the kitchen door, and stood beside him. She understood the struggle  that was going on. The prospector&rsquo;s pick, the handy short shovel, and the neat  pan had accompanied Mike on many a hopeful excursion. He clung to them as a  link with the life he loved. While they remained it seemed to him there was  always a chance of striking it rich one day. As much as a man may love  inanimate things Cragan loved his &ldquo;tools of trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah.  tugged at his elbow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye do it, Mike,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  for why not?&rdquo; Michael rounded on his daughter almost fiercely. &ldquo;What would a  sinsible man be doin&rsquo; wid the like here where yiv shtuck him t&rsquo; paw himself all  day long like a poor bit iv a beetle unther a glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah  hugged his arm. &ldquo;Sure &rsquo;n&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t I mane iv&rsquo;rythin&rsquo; for the best? &rsquo;N&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t I  sore throubled wid thinkin&rsquo; day &rsquo;n&rsquo; night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cragan  saw the tear on Norah&rsquo;s cheek, and hugged her black head convulsively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an  ondacent, ill-mannerly divil, I am that, t&rsquo; be barkin&rsquo; at yeh, me poor gir-rl,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; you the on&rsquo;y wan in the house worth annythin&rsquo; at all,&rdquo; he said, and a  large, opalescent tear hung foolishly from his own nose. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not raysonable  keepin&rsquo; them poor things. Lave me pawn them wid Cohen, &rsquo;n&rsquo; there&rsquo;ll be Sunday&rsquo;s  dinner maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yill  do nothin&rsquo; iv the like, Mike Cragan,&rdquo; said Norah decisively. &ldquo;Lave them be till  Monday. Well enough we&rsquo;ll do manewhile, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Tis certain yill get a  job Monday, man. If no&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll be seekin&rsquo; afther somethin&rsquo; meself, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Mickie  will be sellin&rsquo; the papers. Why not? We&rsquo;ll not be dyin&rsquo; onnecessarily if I know  it, mind yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cragan  looked fondly at her. &ldquo;Yer the shwate, thrue gir-rl, y&rsquo;are, Norah, wid the big,  han&rsquo;some mouth t&rsquo; yeh, a fine, tall husban&rsquo;, rich ez the kings in Connaught,  should be fillin&rsquo; wid kisses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go  on away wid yer poethry, &rsquo;n&rsquo; be diggin&rsquo; me a high wide hole in the yar-rd  there,&rdquo; said Norah. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twill do t&rsquo; bury the rubbish, makes me eyes tired wid  the dishorder iv it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cragan  turned readily. &ldquo;Thrue for yeh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a hole would be a fine thing t&rsquo; bury  it by. I&rsquo;ll be diggin&rsquo; it immejit &rsquo;n&rsquo; quick. A finer hole ye never did see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah  knew perfectly well that she could recommend nothing better for Michael&rsquo;s  despondency. He set to work with a juvenile delight, selected a site for the  hole, and put down a neat, three-by-two prospecting shaft with the exactitude  of a craftsman. He had sunk hundreds of such holes on his prospecting tours at  Binalong, all mathematically correct, plumb straight, and as neat as band  boxes. This one went down quickly. The loam was soft, and under it he found a  strata of sand littered with shells, sea fossils, and scraps of wood. Mike&rsquo;s  cottage was within a quarter of a mile of the bay, and these things did not  surprise him.</p>
<p>Cragan  dug cheerfully. He forgot his troubles at the work his heart was in, and  presently broke into a lilting Irish song. Suddenly work and song ceased. The  pick was suspended in air, and the refrain died on his lips. One moment&rsquo;s  silence, then a &ldquo;Whooroo!&rdquo; subdued by an inspiration of caution, bubbled from  the digger. He hurled the pick aside, and sank on his knees in the hole, pawing  in the sand like an excited monkey.</p>
<p>Half  a minute later Michael Cragan appeared in the kitchen, his eyes rounded with  wonder, his stiff hair electrical with emotion, his accustomed reddish face  almost grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  would yeh be makin&rsquo; iv that, Norah Cragan,&rdquo; he squealed, pounding a small  object on the table.</p>
<p>Three  little Cragans gathered round, eager-eyed. &ldquo;Out iv it!&rdquo; cried Michael. He  seized two youngsters, and butted the third before him. &ldquo;Away wid yeh, &rsquo;n&rsquo; play  yer games,&rdquo; he said. Slamming the door after them, he returned to Norah. &ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have ye a doubt iv it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  gold!&rdquo; said Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goold?  Av course it&rsquo;s goold&mdash;good, shweet, clane, beautiful goold. &rsquo;N&rsquo; that, &rsquo;n&rsquo; that,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; that, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a hape more if I&rsquo;m not terribly mishtook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  where?&rdquo; gasped Norah, now as tremulous and pale as her father. &ldquo;How? Is it the  devil&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;,&rsquo;r what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  a know I know, but it&rsquo;s dug frim the ground this very blessed min-ute, &rsquo;n&rsquo; in  the unlikeliest-lookin&rsquo; dirt ever I set me two eyes on. Come wid me, Norah.  &rsquo;Tis dishthractin&rsquo;, all this goold, &rsquo;n&rsquo; me head&rsquo;s forsook me, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.  Kape the childther off it. Niver a sowl must know, me gir-rl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah  drove the children into the street on some vain errand, and joined her father  at the golden hole. He had all the symptoms of a man mildly demented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,  me gir-rl, look! &rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Is it tlirue at all? Am I dhramin&rsquo;, is it? Hit  me a skelp wid the shovel, &rsquo;n&rsquo; wake me, won&rsquo;t yeh? I&rsquo;m stliruck mad, &rsquo;r daft,  &rsquo;r what? Will yeh look again, Norah, dar-rlin&rsquo;? Tell me is it all thrue. Is me  eyes not disavin&rsquo; me? Shout, will yeh, woman! Is it all there? Goold is ut&mdash;good  goold, is ut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cragan  stood up to his elbows in the shaft, and on the ground before him where Norah  knelt was a pile of yellow, shining pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold  it is!&rdquo; said Norah. She looked about her uneasily. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to us all  at all, Michael Cragan?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  would a poor man be knowin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Cragan replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dug it from the sand, and  ivry shtroke I give there&rsquo;s more. &rsquo;Tis sacret we must be, Norah, sacret &rsquo;n&rsquo;  cunnin&rsquo;, me dear. Did annyone know, they&rsquo;d take it from us, I dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All  that Saturday Cragan pawed and burrowed in the sand, filling a small leather  bag with the gold, and many times Norah made excursions to Michael&rsquo;s bedroom  depositing the treasure in an old Wellington boot under the bed.</p>
<p>They  desisted at nightfall. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twill niver do t&rsquo; be wor-rkin&rsquo; be candle,&rdquo; said  Michael. &ldquo;The neighbors would be mighty curious, &rsquo;n&rsquo; who knows maybe I&rsquo;ll be  wantin&rsquo; t&rsquo; buy thim properties adjacent wan iv them fine days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes,&rdquo; said Norah. She was overstrained and nervous, her eyes were full of a  sort of fear, and her hands were tremulous. So much wealth, and to come so  suddenly. It terrified her like a great disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunit  it is,&rsquo; said Cragan, &ldquo;the finces is high &rsquo;n&rsquo; close, &rsquo;n&rsquo; never a man can see us.  Though I misdoubt they&rsquo;d know did they see. Poor, silly, thriflin&rsquo; fools they  are all here where minin&rsquo; do be consamed. Shtill sacret we&rsquo;ll be, Norah, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  cunnin&rsquo; wid it. In the mornin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll get to wor-rk to build a thriflin&rsquo; small shed  over the shaft. &rsquo;Twill be fer the keepin&rsquo; iv hens do annyone seem curious &rsquo;n&rsquo;  consarned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On  Monday Michael completed the run-&rsquo;em-up shed over his shaft, hustling a  neighboring sawmill for a load of scrap timber, and working with a terrific  energy he sought in vain to disguise.</p>
<p>Inside  that shed, hidden from prying eyes&mdash;if it occurred to any of the neighbors to  pry&mdash;Cragan worked. At first he washed the sand from the hole in his tin dish,  and panned off his prospects as carefully as if he had been after &ldquo;paint&rdquo; gold  on an old field. Later he resorted to a sieve with a suitable mesh as quicker  and more convenient. The pieces of gold were of uniform size, and none escaped  Michael&rsquo;s keen eye and expert paws.</p>
<p>Cragan  saw himself growing rich with startling speed, and by means that seemed  miraculous. He was working the first profitable gold mine in Melbourne, and in  some instances a bucket of his &ldquo;wash&rdquo; outdid anything recorded of the Black  Hill, Ballarat, in the roaring &rsquo;fifties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;  think iv it, Norah,&rdquo; Michael would whisper at night (he had no time for  whispering by day), &ldquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; me afther workin&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo; toilin&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo; diggin&rsquo; all me  days on the fields, &rsquo;n&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but a few thriflin&rsquo; grains, &rsquo;n&rsquo; look  now.&rdquo; He dug his hands into a bucket of it, and let the gold rain through his  fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most  marv&rsquo;lous it is,&rdquo; commented Norah. &ldquo;But will yeh shtop yer foolishnesses, man?  If someone peeked &rsquo;tis t&rsquo; gaol yid go, never a fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;  &rsquo;N&rsquo; for what? Fer diggin&rsquo; me own goold from me own sile, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  dunno at all, Michael, but I&rsquo;m thremulous. I&rsquo;m afeared iv so much gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael  Cragan had pounded many of his pieces into shapeless lumps, and had sold them  here and there. The gold brought &pound;3 15s. an ounce. These were the days when a  man might sell gold without provoking the curiosity of hired officials. Cragan  had paid a deposit on the cottage, and it was now practically his own. Slowly  and insidiously, and very carefully, he was undermining the property, taking  out all the sea sand, sifting every disc of gold from it, and stowing the sand  back tight and trim in the parts already worked out.</p>
<p>Cragan  was a good miner; especially in shallow alluvial. He knew every trick and turn,  and this wonderful little mine in his backyard was being worked with marvellous  precision and neatness, and no scrap of evidence of it appeared outside the  building over his shaft, and very little inside, for there was no need of  windlass and rope, and Cragan kept his shaft covered with slabs. In the  building were two heaps of sand and a sieve. No neighbor of Mike&rsquo;s, seeing  them, would have dreamed of anything beyond simple building operations.</p>
<p>Under  the ground at his smart, well-timbered face, Cragan worked industriously, and  all his work was profitable. He followed the &ldquo;run&rdquo; of gold as a sleuth hound  might follow the scent. It worked wonderfully like a gutter in an ordinary  &ldquo;lead.&rdquo; One day he came upon a &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; which yielded over a thousand pounds  worth of gold. Here, too, he found splintered wood and rusted hoop-iron, a  clue, perhaps, to the origin of his wonderful alluvial deposit had Michael been  seeking clues.</p>
<p>Cragan  did not buy the adjoining properties. He found that the golden dirt petered out  in every direction before he reached the dividing fences. The full richness of  it was in his own yard, and in two months&rsquo; time he had cleaned up every ounce  of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  not ez rich ez them Rothschildther, &rsquo;r them Rocky-fellers, me gir-rl, but &rsquo;tis  rich enough we are to go on wid, &rsquo;n&rsquo; the lark is, never a divil suspicts it,  but me &rsquo;n&rsquo; you bechune us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;  &rsquo;N&rsquo; how much would it be all told?&rdquo; asked Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisper,  me gir-rl. &rsquo;Tis six thousand, nine hunthred, &rsquo;n&rsquo; fifty-foive pounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor-rd  have mercy!&rdquo; gasped Norah. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a sinful lot iv money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;  &rsquo;N&rsquo; from where did it come ever?&rdquo; said Cragan. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis that is fillin&rsquo; me wid  wontherment. Is there anny more hereabout? I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; meself ever. Sure, I  can&rsquo;t shleep fer askin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  eventually enlightenment came, and Cragan slept again, convinced he was wasting  no opportunities. Knowledge was proffered unsolicited by big Tim Kelly, an  oldest inhabitant of those parts, a roaring great Irishman whose acquaintance  Mike had made soon after the working out of his mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  I remember the time when all this was nothin&rsquo; but a shwamp,&rdquo; said Kelly  spreading his arms to indicate the surroundings. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas filled up by the  Government. They put a mighty great pump down in the sea beyant &rsquo;n&rsquo;, shquirted  millyins iv tons iv silt &rsquo;n&rsquo; rubbish out iv the bay, &rsquo;n&rsquo; filled up the low  counthry ez yid fill a pie, so they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  land, too?&rdquo; asked Cragan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be  sure, man. Your land is about the centre of it. Years before that I was shtill  an ould &rsquo;n&rsquo; respected resident iv the dishthrict. Right back afore the robbin&rsquo;  iv the &lsquo;The White Knight&rsquo; I was here, payin&rsquo; me rates honorable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  White Knight is it?&rdquo; said Cragan nervously curious. &ldquo;That was the ship carryin&rsquo;  the goold t&rsquo; England.  The Morgan gang got at her &rsquo;n&rsquo; sthripped her sthronghold. Twenty-one thousand  pounds in sov&rsquo;reigns they tuk. But &rsquo;twas told et the time, &rsquo;n&rsquo; ginerally believed,  wan box iv seven thousand was let fall in the bay. Many a party thried with  divers t&rsquo; recover it, but &rsquo;twas never seen again, supposin&rsquo; the thaves lost it  at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing  at a large crucible in his shed that evening, sweating over the melting down of  a ladle of sovereigns dated 1854, Cragan&rsquo;s musings found vent in involuntary  speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  wontherin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the bla&rsquo;guard got a holt iv that other  fourty-foive sovereigns iv mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Lord of Lithuanian acres in the marches  of the North<br>

  He had summoned sons and vassals as of old to hear his will,<br>

  Say you are the son of Boudrys and the wielder of his sword.</em></p>
<p><em>In that land of craven traders there are  spoils the taking worth,<br>
  Very rich and far more plenteous than the niggard fruits of earth.<br>
  Let your booty be the fairs that make a summer in men&rsquo;s veins,<br>
  What time all the fiends of winter hold as theirs our snowy plains;<br>
  Bring you silken robes embroidered in the cunning Eastern kind.<br>
  Flashing like the soul of jewels rays that would the gazer blind.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You go west against the Teutons with  the host whom Keystut leads;<br>

  And the burghers of its cities, lest their houses be their pyre,<br>
  Fill your tents with hoarded riches, be thy choice upon that day<br>
  Gold, gold of sea-washed amber and the rubies&rsquo; bloody ray.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Go, my last son, with Skirgello over Niemen&rsquo;s rushing stream,<br>

  Very small is Poland&rsquo;s  treasure for her spoiler when she yields:<br>
  Noble weapons&mdash;mighty lances and impenetrable shields.</em></p>
<p><em>Bring a wife from war-worn Poland,  for no land can boast so well<br>

<p><em>Soon they passed from out the courtyard,  autumn went and winter came;<br>
  Endless seemed the days to Boudrys lonely, yearning for their fame.<br>

<p><em>Then another horseman slowly rode across  the frozen plain<br>

  Sudden a maiden leapt from those around<br>
  And thrust her arm across the iron grate&mdash;<br>
  She held them, till beneath the shattering weight<br>
  The brave bone snapt. She swooned upon the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>Thus, Belgium, when hell&rsquo;s traitors  rushed the door<br>
  Lusting to give the world to spoil and flame,<br>
  And wreak their hate on all the true and free,<br>
  Thy brave arm held them, yet no rescue came.<br>
  &mdash;&rsquo;Tis shattered, and thou liest wounded sore<br>
  That we may live. What shall we do for thee?</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>A Story for  Children</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Annie B.  Rentoul</em></p>
<p>When  Bunny-Boy&rsquo;s father and mother gave him a name, all the Good Fairies came to the  christening. All the Good Fairies came, but there was one Bad Fairy too. It is  so with every baby boy and girl at a christening.</p>
<p>Of  course there were some other people at the christening. There was the  clergyman, who gave Bunny-Boy God&rsquo;s blessing, and dear Grannie, who brought him  a silver mug, and cook, who baked him a white frosted cake with no candles on  it at all. But the Fairies all had gifts as well. Each of the Good Fairies gave  him a good gift, but the Bad Fairy gave him an evil gift. For it is always so,  when a baby gets its name.</p>
<p>The  last of the Good Fairies kissed Bunny-Boy one kiss on each bold black eye, and  gave him the power of seeing the Fairies. Then she flew away through the window  on her wings of sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is going to rain!&rdquo; cried dear Grannie, as the Bad Fairy stooped over Bunny-Boy,  who crowed in his mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>The  Bad Fairy blew blind-dust into Bunny-Boy&rsquo;s two bright eyes, and took away the  power of seeing the Fairies, after he should have cut his first wisdom-tooth.  Then she gave a wicked chuckle, and Bunny-Boy began to cry and sob. But the Bad  Fairy flew out of the window on her wings of storm-cloud, and no one in the  room could hush the baby, till the shadow of the Bad Fairy was gone, and the  shining sunbeams slid through the window again.</p>
<p>Of  course it is a very long, long way to first-wisdom-tooth-cutting. A baby has to  be quite twenty-one candles old to reach that time. In fact, it has to be  really grown-up, and beyond counting the candles on a birthday cake to tell its  time of life. So the Bad Fairy&rsquo;s gift did not concern Bunny-Boy much, because  it was very far away, and he could not see it so plainly as the tiniest twinky  star in the dimmest corner of the sky.</p>
<p>But  the last Good Fairy&rsquo;s gift was very important. You know some of us <em>believe</em> in Fairies. Some of us even <em>hear</em> them, on windy nights outside, or  when it is very quiet in the house. But who ever <em>sees</em> them, except in dreams? Do you, for instance?</p>
<p>Well,  I may tell you that Bunny-Boy saw them all the time, and they made him very  tricksy and whimsical from his earliest beginning,&mdash;long before he had reached a  one-candle cake.</p>
<p>At  first he used to lie in his pram, and twiggle his ten pink fingers at the  prick-eared wavy leaves above him, and listen to the birds&rsquo; gossip, and the  wind&rsquo;s song in the branches. Next he would crawl along the floor to catch those  golden butterflies called sunbeams. He would shut his fist very tight with a  butterfly inside. He would open his fist very carefully, and peep in to look at  the butterfly. But it had always flown. In the bath Bunny-Boy chased the soap  bubbles on top of the water. He wanted to crack them open and look inside. He  wanted the drip-drop diamonds from the tap for playthings. But, however tight  he doubled up his fists, bubbles and drip-drops always escaped. For, you see,  they are Fairy toys.</p>
<p>When  Bunny-Boy was two candles old, cook made him a big pink and white cake, with a  pink candle and a white candle. Nursie wove him a pink and white daisy-chain.  And his four Aunties,&mdash;Aunt Polly, Aunt Dolly, Aunt Prue, and Aunt Sue,&mdash; each  unknown to the other, gave him a cuddly brown Teddy Bear, four bears in all.</p>
<p>These  are only a few of the surprises that came on two-candle day. But these are  picked out to talk about, because they are in the story.</p>
<p>Bunny-Boy,  you must know, lived in a white house in a big gum-tree forest, which was just  full of Fairies. Beyond the gum-tree forest was a belt of ti-tree, where  Brownies peeped and bunnies popped, quicker than shooting stars. The ti-tree  fringed a silver shore, where little waves played chase up and down the sand.  The great water stretched far and far away, where ships slide over the world&rsquo;s  edge on strange adventures.</p>
<p>On  two-candle day little boys and girls came to the white house to eat up the pink  and white cake with the two candles. More, and more, and more little boys and  girls came, till the garden was quite full of them, and Bunny-Boy was hoping  the cake would go all round, and leave a few sugary crumbs for the four  Teddies.</p>
<p>It  was when they were playing hide-and-seek, and Bunny-Boy was in a hidey-hole  behind the hedge near the gate, that he saw a little Fairy-Girl peeping  wistfully through the green bars. A minute ago she had looked like a little  white gum-tree with smoke-blue leaves. Now, as plain as plain, she was a Fairy  with golden hair and sky-blue wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  and play!&rdquo; said Bunny-Boy, opening the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  do not see me!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<em>You</em> see  me, but not the others. Come and play on the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bunny-Boy  left all the little boys and girls. But he carried his four Teddy Bears, two  under each arm, and hurried after the Fairy. The little bears squeaked their  fiercest squeaks, and grunted a great deal.</p>
<p>For  it was a very tight squeeze.</p>
<p>At  last they reached the shore and rolled on the sand, tired out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  can I be a Fairy?&rdquo; Bunny-Boy asked the blue-winged Fairy, when he got back his  breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!  How can <em>we</em> be Fairies?&rdquo; squeaked all  four Baby-Bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course toys <em>are</em> a kind of  Fairy-Folk,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;though they are a very poor kind of Fairy! <em>You</em> are better than most Earth-Babies,&rdquo;  she said to Bunny-Boy. &ldquo;Still, you are very far from being a Fairy. You might  try first to turn into a Mer-baby, as silver-finned things are nearer to  mortals than Fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  might we try to be Mer-bears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  yes, of course! A person might <em>try</em> to  be anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;an Earth-Baby ought to take off all his mortal  wrappings. But you should leave on that ribbon of flowers. If you sit in the  sea with that ribbon round you, the Mer-children might give you a fish-tail in  exchange for the ribbon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  they give <em>us</em> fish-tails?&rdquo; asked all  four bears in chorus. &ldquo;For we can&rsquo;t take off our wrappings! Besides it is  rather wet in the sea for sitting down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must put up with getting wet, if you wish to be Mer-bears! What is the use of a  tail, except to swim with? And how can you swim, unless you get wet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  sat in a row for a long, long time on the edge of the waves. The little crabs  tickled the Teddies&rsquo; toes, and the little waves tickled Bunny-Boy&rsquo;s. But the  Mer-children hid shyly in the curve of the green breakers, under the snowy  crests of foam, and would not be coaxed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am rather glad!&rdquo; said Bunny-Boy to the Fairy. &ldquo;For what would Nursie say, if I  gave away my daisy-chain? Besides, I wonder if she would quite like me with a  tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course she would!&rdquo; said the Fairy. &ldquo;She would much rather polish one tail a  morning, than scrub all your socks, and shine all your shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I cannot have a tail, what about wings?&rdquo; said Bunny-Boy. &ldquo;Your two blue wings  are very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  very hard to grow!&rdquo; said the Fairy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We</em> all want rose-red wings!&rdquo; cried the  little Bears. &ldquo;We want to fly up to the tree-tops, like the parrots, and sip  honey, and peck fruit. How did <em>you</em> get your wings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairies <em>grow</em> wings,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo; If I lost my  wings, I could never fly home to Fairyland!&rdquo; She looked very sad to think of  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <em>I</em> had wings,&rdquo; asked Bunny-Boy, &ldquo;could <em>I </em>fly to Fairyland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&mdash;if  they were Fairy wings. But how <em>can</em> an  Earth-Baby grow them? Birds and butterflies have lovely wings, that God made.  And boats have not bad wings, that men make. But those fool-things, called  aeroplanes, cannot fly far or strong, and have no feathers on their buzzing  wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I cannot <em>grow</em> wings, I might <em>find</em> some!&rdquo; said Bunny-Boy, with his  black eyes all shiny.</p>
<p>So  the Fairy and Bunny-Boy talked about it, till the round golden moon climbed  over the ocean-rim, and turned the big water into moving gold.</p>
<p>The  Baby-Bears had soon wearied of talk involving such hard problems. All four had  gone tree-climbing in search of wings up there in the tree-tops, where, many  and many a night, we hear many and many a Baby-Bear squeak with glee, riding  pick-a-back on its Mammy&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am tired!&rdquo; yawned the little Fairy, with a graceful Fairy yawn. &ldquo;We will sleep  in these wild orchids under the ti-tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  lay down beside Bunny-Boy, and was soon fast asleep. But Bunny-Boy was wide  awake, and his bold black eyes were full of wicked plans. He crawled softly up  to the little Fairy, and pulled off both her sky-blue wings.</p>
<p>Up  in Fairyland the Bad Fairy chuckled. She knew a Fairy would miss her wings more  than an Earth-Baby its hands and feet.</p>
<p>Bunny-Boy  ran fast, fast to a little hole in the ti-tree. He sat there in the dark, and  tried to fasten the blue wings on to his shoulders. But they would not stick.  So he left them there alone, neatly folded together in the dark hole, and crept  back on tip-toe to where the Fairy was sleeping. No wings were on his  shoulders,&mdash;only a daisy-chain.</p>
<p>The  Fairy sat up, and rubbed her eyes. &ldquo;I thought I felt a Bad Fairy about!&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;But, come! we must not think of sad things. I will play to you on my  golden flute. The Brownies made it underground of pure, pounded wattle-blossom.  When I play on it, it is hard to tell whether my songs are scents or sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play  to me about wings,&rdquo; said Bunny-Boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  afterwards my wings must carry me home to Fairyland,&rdquo; she said. So she put her  golden flute to her lips, and this is what it sang:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birdie,  you could never lie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that narrow shell of blue,<br>
  When God gave all the wide blue sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wings, and songs, to you.</p>
<p>Blossom,  you could never rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bud of velvet curled,<br>
  When you may dance, in rainbow vest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet-scented, o&rsquo;er the world.</p>
<p>Baby,  you could never sleep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a cot with golden bars;<br>
  But you will wake from dreams, to sweep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the golden stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  music is beautiful!&rdquo; said Bunny-Boy. &ldquo;But I did not notice much about <em>wings</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some  day you will understand,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;if you keep the song in your heart  all the way to Someday.&rdquo; </p>
<p><a name="page164"></a></p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300031h-images/page164.jpg" alt="page164" width="533" height="750"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I have a very good song in my <em>head</em>,&rdquo;  said Bunny-Boy, &ldquo;which I will sing to you soon. But let us dance first, for  that music makes me feel very tippy-toe in the legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  music had called the four Bears down from the trees, and they all joined hands  with Bunny-Boy to dance ring-a-rosy, while the Fairy piped to them.</p>
<p>When  they had danced till they could see how the round world spins, they all flung  down on the moss, and the Fairy asked Bunny-Boy to favour them with his song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is more a story,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one of my adventures, which I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin  right away!&rdquo; cried the four Bears. &ldquo;We hate preambles, preludes, forewords, and  apologies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  this is Bunny-Boy&rsquo;s story:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>THE LITLE LAND</strong></p>
<p>In  the gully playing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone, all alone,<br>
  I saw a sunbeam straying<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a mossy stone.<br>
  So softly in I put my hand,<br>
  And found a very little land.</p>
<p>Toadstools  were the houses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misty-rose, smoky-blue;<br>
  All the trees were mosses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pools were drops of dew;<br>
  And all the beds were cobwebs thin<br>
  To cradle sleeping Fairies in.</p>
<p>Moths  and bees were birdies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver-gray, velvet-brown;<br>
  Cricket hurdy-gurdies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made music in the town.<br>
  And all the tiny folks came out,<br>
  And in the sunbeam moved about.</p>
<p>They  could not see me peeping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their Fairy eyes.<br>
  They thought a cloud was creeping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across their cool green skies;<br>
  And soon their little sunbeam sun<br>
  Came out again, and day was done.</p>
<p>I  heard small insects tinkle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like homing cows at seven;<br>
  I saw a daisy twinkle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For moonlight in their Heaven.<br>
  And, when I came away at last,<br>
  I felt so very big and vast.</p>
<p>I will  go back to-morrow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With soldiers in my hand,<br>
  For, oh, it would be sorrow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose my little land.<br>
  But brave tin soldiers blue and red<br>
  Will guard it, while I sleep in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  it would be sorrow to lose Fairyland!&rdquo; cried the Fairy, disregarding the brave  tin soldiers. She shook her two shoulders to air the crumples in her blue  wings. But the wings were gone.</p>
<p>She  threw herself face down on the moss, and cried as if her heart would break. And  to see a Fairy cry is indeed a sad sight.</p>
<p>The  Baby-Bears all squeaked in sympathetic chorus. But Bunny-Boy slunk away guilty  and miserable. And he felt something like this:&mdash;</p>
<p>When  the darkness gathers in,<br>
  We remember every sin,<br>
  All the little things we did,<br>
  Which the golden daylight hid.</p>
<p>But,  when God sends back the sun,<br>
  We forget them every, one,<br>
  Doing bad things through the light,<br>
  Which we think of in the night.</p>
<p>He  crept to the hole in the ti-tree. He meant to give back the blue wings; but,  when he patted them, and saw how pretty they were,&mdash;like little cut-out petals  of the sky,&mdash;he just <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em>.</p>
<p>So  he tried to comfort the Fairy another way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  cry! You will stay with me always, and never fly away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  she cried harder, and harder, and harder. For what is one Earth-Baby compared  with all Fairyland? Bunny-Boy thought she was turning into a little, dying,  white gum-tree instead of a Fairy Without Wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  will never do to make her all deaded,&rdquo; he said, beginning to cry too. He did  not think about himself at all,&mdash;only of the sick Fairy. He ran and fetched the  blue wings, and tied them on with his own daisy-chain to make up for being so  cruel before. And the Fairy Without Wings was so glad to have her wings again,  that she flew off with never a thank-you or goodbye, and left Bunny-Boy crying  in the ti-tree. He cried all alone in the dark, and she did not look back once.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Next  morning Bunny-Boy sat up in his cot (where, of course, it would be easy for the  Fairies to waft him from the ti-tree scrub).</p>
<p>The  four Teddy-Bears sat, two on each side of the cot, waiting for Master to wake  up and play. Nursie stood at the foot, smiling and brisk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  was it that happened in the night?&rdquo; asked Bunny-Boy, trying to remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby  Sister came in the night,&rdquo; said Nursie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Bunny-Boy. &ldquo;It was a Fairy Without Wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are a queer child!&rdquo; said Nursie.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Later  on Bunny-Boy saw Baby Sister. He knew at once, by her smile and her blue eyes,  that the Fairy had come back to stay for always, because he had given back her  wings and let her fly away.</p>
<p>He  peeped at her shoulders, and there were no sky-blue feathers, not even  fairy-size. There were just two dimples where the wings used to sprout.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>All  the Good Fairies came to the christening, and the one Bad Fairy was there too.  The last of the Good Fairies hid the magic golden flute in Baby Sister&rsquo;s little  throat. But the Bad Fairy put a longing for wings in her heart, though Baby  Sister could never, never fly away to Fairyland, except in dreams. For now she  was an Earth-Baby.</p>
<p>When  Someday comes, we shall all have beautiful wings, and then we shall live happy  ever after. So Bunny-Boy&rsquo;s story has a good ending, as all proper Fairytales  must.</p>

  Long ago&mdash;long ago!<br>
  Yet the wile of faery lingers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age-old Magians speak<br>
  If my hand may touch your fingers<br>
  And my lips your check.</em></p>

<p><em>Lord  God of Battles, girt with steel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ringed with flame, avenger, slayer,<br>
  To thee, and thee alone, I kneel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red God of Carnage, hear my prayer!</em></p>
<p><em>Not  mine the thorn-crown&rsquo;d God of Love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By slaves and weaklings held divine;<br>
  Whose symbols are the lamb, the dove,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The eagle and the wolf are thine;) &mdash;</em></p>
<p><em>Nor  yet the God who takes his stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Justice, though an Empire fall,&mdash;<br>
  Who metes, with cold, impartial hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An equal measure unto all;&mdash;</em></p>
<p><em>From  all such shadowy deities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to thee, great God of Might;<br>
  My sword obeys thy high decrees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My shrapnel bursts for thy delight;</em></p>
<p><em>My  thunder-throated guns declare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine excellence, dread Lord of Death:<br>
The city wall, how strong soe&rsquo;er,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is shattered by their fiery breath.</em></p>
<p><em>Behold  what goodly sacrifice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy dark altar I have laid;<br>
  May it find favour in thine eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When here I call to thee for aid!</em></p>
<p><em>Rally  anew my broken ranks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-form my spent and wavering line;<br>
  So shall thy servant give thee thanks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever praise thy name divine.</em></p>
<p><em>To  pleasure thee my blade was bared,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee my eagle flag unfurled;<br>
  To serve thy will my hands have dared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ruin realms, and clutch the world.</em></p>
