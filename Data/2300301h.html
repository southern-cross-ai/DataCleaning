<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Dreams"></a>Dreams</b></h2>
<p>I HAVE been dreaming  all a summer day<br>
  Of rare and dainty poems I would write;<br>
  Love-lyrics delicate as lilac-scent,<br>
  Soft idylls woven of wind, and flower, and stream,<br>
  And songs and sonnets carven in fine gold.</p>
<p>The day is fading and  the dusk is cold;<br>
  Out of the skies has gone the opal gleam,<br>
  Out of my heart has passed the high intent<br>
  Into the shadow of the falling night&mdash;<br>
  Must all my dreams in darkness pass away?</p>
<p>I have been dreaming  all a summer day:<br>
  Shall I go dreaming so until Life&rsquo;s light<br>
  Fades in Death&rsquo;s dusk, and all my days are spent?<br>
  Ah, what am I the dreamer but a dream!<br>
  The day is fading and the dusk is cold.</p>
<p>My songs and sonnets  carven in fine gold<br>
  Have faded from me with the last day-beam<br>
  That purple lustre to the sea-line lent,<br>
  And flushed the clouds with rose and chrysolite;<br>
  So days and dreams in darkness pass away.</p>
<p>I have been dreaming  all a summer day<br>
  Of songs and sonnets carven in fine gold;<br>
  But all my dreams in darkness pass away;<br>
  The day is fading, and the dusk is cold.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Lethe"></a>Lethe</b></h2>
<p>THROUGH the noiseless  doors of Death<br>
  Three passed out, as with one breath.</p>
<p>Two had faces stern as  Fate,<br>
  Stamped with unrelenting hate.</p>
<p>One upon her lips of  guile<br>
  Wore a cold, mysterious smile.</p>
<p>Each of each unseen,  the pale<br>
  Shades went down the hollow vale</p>
<p>Till they came unto the  deep<br>
  River of Eternal Sleep.</p>
<p>Breath of wind, or wing  of bird,<br>
  Never that dark stream hath stirred;</p>
<p>Still it seems as is  the shore,<br>
  But it flows for evermore</p>
<p>Softly, through the  meadows wan<br>
  To the Sea Oblivion.</p>
<p>In the dusk, like drops  of blood,<br>
  Poppies hang above the flood;</p>
<p>On its surface lies a  thin,<br>
  Ghostly web of mist, wherein</p>
<p>All things vague and  changing seem<br>
  As the faces in a dream.</p>
<p>Two knelt down upon the  bank<br>
  And of that dark water drank.</p>
<p>But the Third stood by  the while,<br>
  Smiling her mysterious smile.</p>
<p>Rising up, those shades  of men<br>
  Gazed upon each other, then</p>
<p>Side by side, upon the  bank,<br>
  In a bed of poppies sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; one to the  other saith,<br>
  &ldquo;Sent <i>thee </i>through the doors of  death?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While life throbbed in  every vein,<br>
  For a woman I was slain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is but a fleeting  spell,<br>
  Hate alone remembers well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my slayer I shall  wait,<br>
  And though he at Heaven&rsquo;s gate</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand, and wear an  angel&rsquo;s crown,<br>
  I shall seize and drag him down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the stern shade made  reply.<br>
  Then the first that spake said: &ldquo;I</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a woman&rsquo;s sake,  also,<br>
  Slew myself&mdash;and slew my foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slew myself, that in  no shape<br>
  He my vengeance should escape,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till Oblivion swallow  both:<br>
  And I swore a solemn oath</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would&mdash;hate remembers  well&mdash;<br>
  Hunt his spotted soul to hell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I left, ere leave-taking,<br>
  Round her throat a dark red ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall know her&mdash;you  shall note&mdash;<br>
  By that red ring round her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I loved my fair,  false wife,<br>
  And perchance in this new life</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may love me&mdash;we  shall see&mdash;<br>
  She shall choose &rsquo;twixt him and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Softly did the other  sigh:<br>
  &ldquo;My love&rsquo;s love will never die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is <i>not </i>a fleeting spell&mdash;<br>
  Love, like hate, remembers well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon&mdash;mayhap on this  dim shore&mdash;<br>
  We shall meet to part no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the first Shade  spoke and said:<br>
  &ldquo;In this Kingdom of the Dead</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us, who so  strangely meet,<br>
  Pledge each other in this sweet</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water, our revenge to  wreak<br>
  Side by side, and so to seek,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Side by side, whate&rsquo;er  our fate,<br>
  Those we love and those we hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kneeling on the dim  shore then,<br>
  Side by side, they drank again.</p>
<p>And they saw, like  drops of blood,<br>
  Poppies nodding o&rsquo;er the flood,</p>
<p>And they gazed upon the  thin<br>
  Ghostly web of mist, wherein</p>
<p>All things vague and  changing seem<br>
  As the faces in a dream;</p>
<p>And by some enchantment  weird,<br>
  As they gazed thereon appeared</p>
<p>Unto each, down-bending  low,<br>
  Form and features of his foe,</p>
<p>For a moment, then were  gone,<br>
  And upon the meadows wan&mdash;</p>
<p>Half in Death and half  a-swoon&mdash;<br>
  Shone a pale and spectral moon.</p>
<p>Then these twain rose,  drowsy-eyed,<br>
  And departed side by side.</p>
<p>But the Woman Shade the  while<br>
  Smiled her cold, mysterious smile.</p>
<p>And her beauty made a  light<br>
  In that realm of pallid night</p>
<p>(Beauty laughs at worm  and grave)<br>
  Like the moon beneath the wave.</p>
<p>Back she flung her hair  of gold,<br>
  Glowing, gleaming, fold on fold,</p>
<p>Showing&mdash;all but these  might note&mdash;<br>
  The red ring around her throat.</p>
<p>But they passed with  cold surprise,<br>
  And unrecognising eyes.</p>
<p>Lightly laughed she  then, and said:<br>
  &ldquo;In this Kingdom of the Dead</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange the sights  that one may see!<br>
  There go twain who died for me</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeking, through  Creation wide,<br>
  For each other&mdash;side by side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she wove a poppy  crown,<br>
  Placed it on her head, and down</p>
<p>On the river&rsquo;s margin  sank<br>
  Midst the poppies of its bank,</p>
<p>Saying: &ldquo;In the world  above<br>
  Long he tarries, my true love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here beside this river&rsquo;s  rim<br>
  I will sleep, and wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="LoveLaurel"></a>Love-Laurel</b></h2>
<p align="center"><i>In Memory Of Henry Kendall</i></p>
<p>AH! that God once would  touch my lips with song<br>
  To pierce, as prayer doth heaven, earth&rsquo;s breast of iron,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that with sweet mouth I might sing to thee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sweet dead singer buried by the sea,<br>
  A song, to woo thee, as a wooing siren,<br>
  Out of that silent sleep which seals too long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy mouth of melody.</p>
<p>For, if live lips might  speak awhile to dead,<br>
  Or any speech could reach the sad world under<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world of ours, song surely should awake<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee who didst dwell in shadow for song&rsquo;s sake!<br>
  Alas! thou canst not hear the voice of thunder,<br>
  Nor low dirge over thy low-lying head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds of morning make.</p>
<p>Down through the clay  there comes no sound of these;<br>
  Down in the grave there is no sign of Summer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any knowledge of the soft-eyed Spring;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Death sits there, with outspread ebon wing,<br>
  Closing with dust the mouth of each new-comer<br>
  To that mute land, where never sound of seas<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heard, and no birds sing.</p>
<p>Now thou hast found the  end of all thy days<br>
  Hast thou found any heart a vigil keeping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee among the dead&mdash;some heart that heard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy singing when thou wert a brown, sweet bird<br>
  Gray &AElig;ons gone, in some old forest sleeping<br>
  Beneath the seas long since? in Death&rsquo;s dim ways<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has thy heart any word?</p>
<p>For surely those in  whom the deathless spark<br>
  Of song is kindled, sang from the beginning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If life were always? But the old desires&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they exist when sad-eyed Hope expires?<br>
  How live the dead? what crowns have they for winning?<br>
  Have they, to warm them in the dreamless dark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sun earth&rsquo;s central fires?</p>
<p>Are the dead dead  indeed whom we call dead?<br>
  Has God no life but this of ours for giving?&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that they took thee by each well-known place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stark in thy coffin with a cold white face,<br>
  What thought, O Brother, hadst thou of the living?<br>
  What of the sun that round thee glory shed?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the fair day&rsquo;s grace?</p>
<p>Is thy new life made up  of memories<br>
  Or dreams that lull the dead, bright visions bringing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Spring above! Are thy days short or long?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou who wert master of our singing throng<br>
  Mayhap in death thou hast not lost thy singing,<br>
  But chauntst unheard, beside the moaning sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A solitary song.</p>
<p>The chance spade turns  up skulls. God help the dead<br>
  And thee whose singing days have all passed over&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee, whom the gold-haired Spring shall seek in vain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at the glad year&rsquo;s doors she stands again,<br>
  Remembering the song-garlands thou hast wove her<br>
  In years gone by: but all these years have fled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all their joy and pain.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>My soul laughed out to  hear my heart speak so,<br>
  And sprang forth skyward, as an eagle, hoping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look upon thy soul with living eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it came to where our dim life dies,<br>
  And dead suns darkly for a grave are groping<br>
  Through cycles of immeasurable woe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stone-blind in the blind skies.</p>
<p>The stars walk  shuddering on that awful verge<br>
  From which my soul, with swift and fearless motion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clove the black depths, and sought for God and thee;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But God dwells where nor stars nor suns there be&mdash;<br>
  No shore there is to His Eternal Ocean;<br>
  A thousand systems are a fringe of surge<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that great starless sea.</p>
<p>And thou wert not. So  that, with weary plumes,<br>
  My soul through the great void its way came winging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To earth again. &ldquo;What hope for him who sings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there?&rdquo; it sighed. &ldquo;Death ends all sweetest things.&rdquo;<br>
  When lo! there came a swell of mighty singing,<br>
  Flooding all space, and swift athwart the glooms<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of sudden wings.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Dreamer of dreams, thy  songs and dreams are done.<br>
  Down where thou sleepest in earth&rsquo;s secret bosom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sorrow and no joy for thee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who canst not see what stars at eve there be,<br>
  Nor evermore at morn the green dawn blossom<br>
  Into the golden king-flower of the sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the golden sea.</p>
<p>But haply there shall  come in days to be<br>
  One who shall hear his own heart beating faster,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plucking a rose sprung from thy heart beneath,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from his soul, as sword from out its sheath,<br>
  Song shall leap forth where now, O silent master,<br>
  On thy lone grave beside the sounding sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay this laurel-wreath. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AVisionOfYouth"></a>A Vision Of Youth</b></h2>
<p>A HORSEMAN on a hilltop  green<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew rein, and wound his horn;<br>
  So bright he looked he might have been<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Herald of the Morn.</p>
<p>His steed was of the sovran  strain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fancy&rsquo;s meadows bred&mdash;<br>
  And pride was in his tossing mane,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And triumph in his tread.</p>
<p>The rider&rsquo;s eyes like  jewels glowed&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World was in his hand&mdash;<br>
  As down the woodland way he rode<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Spring was in the land.</p>
<p>From golden hour to  golden hour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him the woodland sang,<br>
  And from the heart of every flower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A singing fairy sprang.</p>
<p>He rode along with rein  so free,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as he rode, the Blue<br>
  Mysterious Bird of Fantasy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever before him flew.</p>
<p>He rode by cot and  castle dim<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the greenland gay;<br>
  Bright eyes through casements glanced at him;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed&mdash;and rode away.</p>
<p>The world with sunshine  was aflood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And glad were maid and man,<br>
  And through his throbbing veins the blood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keen, sweet shudders ran.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>His steed tossed head  with fiery scorn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stamped, and snuffed the air&mdash;<br>
  As though he heard a sudden horn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of far-off battle blare.</p>
<p>Erect the rider sat  awhile<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flashing eyes, and then<br>
  Turned slowly, sighing, with a smile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O weary world of men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For aye the Bird of  Fantasy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang magic songs to him,<br>
  And deep and deeper still rode he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Forest Dim.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>That rider with his  face aglow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy of life I see<br>
  In dreams. Ah, years and years ago<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He parted ways with me!</p>
<p>Yet, sometimes, when  the days are drear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world forlorn,<br>
  From out the dim wood&rsquo;s heart I hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The echo of his horn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Aphrodite"></a>Aphrodite</b></h2>
<p>ON a golden dawn in the  dawn sublime<br>
  Of years ere the stars had ceased to sing,<br>
  Beautiful out of the sea-deeps cold<br>
  Aphrodite arose&mdash;the Flower of Time&mdash;<br>
  That, dear till the day of her blossoming,<br>
  The old, old Sea had borne in his heart.<br>
  Around her worshipping waves did part<br>
  Tremulous&mdash;glowing in rose and gold.</p>
<p>And the birds broke  forth into singing sweet,<br>
  And flowers born scentless breathed perfume:<br>
  Softly she smiled upon Man forlorn,<br>
  And the music of love in his wild heart beat,<br>
  And down to the pit went his gods of gloom,<br>
  And earth grew bright and fair as a bride,<br>
  And folk in star-worlds wondering cried&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Lo in the skies a new star is born!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O Beloved, thus on my  small world you<br>
  Rose, flushing it all with rosy flame!<br>
  Changing sad thoughts to a singing throng,<br>
  And creating the earth and the sky anew!<br>
  As Love you appeared&mdash;and, lo, you are Fame,<br>
  And, all my follies and sins despite,<br>
  You yet, Beloved, may see my light&mdash;<br>
  Small, but a star&mdash;mid the stars of song.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheRajahsSapphires"></a>The Rajah&rsquo;s Sapphires</b></h2>
<p>IN my garden, O Beloved!<br>
  Many pleasant trees are growing,<br>
  Peach, and apricot, and apple,<br>
  Myrtle, lilac, and laburnum.</p>
<p>Fair are they, but  midst them lonely,<br>
  Like an exiled Eastern Princess<br>
  In a strange land far from kindred,<br>
  Stands a lonely fair Pomegranate.</p>
<p>Dreaming of its native  Orient<br>
  Always is the fair Pomegranate,<br>
  And beneath it I lie dreaming<br>
  Of thine eyes and thee, Beloved!</p>
<p>Overhead its red  globes, gleaming<br>
  Like red moons, old tales recall of<br>
  Eastern moons and songs of Hafiz&mdash;<br>
  Nightingales, and wine, and roses.</p>
<p>And at times it seems a  mystic<br>
  Tree Circ&eacute;an, whose red fruit is<br>
  Broken hearts of old-time lovers,<br>
  Thus their secrets sad revealing.</p>
<p>And within each red  sun-cloven<br>
  Glossy globe, like little rosy<br>
  Hearts within a great heart glowing,<br>
  Glow translucent seeds of crimson.</p>
<p>Like the fruit of the  Pomegranate<br>
  Full of little hearts my heart is,<br>
  And the little hearts so glowing<br>
  They are thoughts of thee, Beloved!</p>
<p>Haply these at times  are woven<br>
  In with dreams of the Pomegranate;<br>
  Thus, perchance, I dreamt the wondrous<br>
  Dream within a dream here written.</p>
<p>In his palace-hall,  methought, I<br>
  Saw a splendid Indian Rajah;<br>
  Fame and Fortune were his vassals,<br>
  But his heart was sad within him.</p>
<p>Round him stood his  chiefs and captains.<br>
  &ldquo;Great art thou,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;O Rajah!<br>
  And thy hand is strong in battle.&rdquo;<br>
  But he smiled not at their speeches.</p>
<p>Silently through his  Zenana<br>
  Passed he, glanced with cold and careless<br>
  Eyes at women, fair as houris<br>
  Seen in visions bred of hasheesh.</p>
<p>Like to dawn, and noon,  and starry<br>
  Night&mdash;like all the moods of passion&mdash;<br>
  Were they, rose-and-white Circassians,<br>
  Amber Hindoos, dark-eyed Persians.</p>
<p>Dancing girls with  golden armlets,<br>
  Golden rings around their ankles&mdash;<br>
  Making music clear, melodious<br>
  As the plash of crystal fountains</p>
<p>Heard in still, hot  nights of summer&mdash;<br>
  Danced the Lovers&rsquo; Dance before him;<br>
  But he heeded not their dancing,<br>
  For his heart was sad within him.</p>
<p>Thence unto his  treasure-chamber<br>
  Strode he&mdash;there to gaze on gems that<br>
  Rajahs dead had won and hoarded;<br>
  Tragic-storied, splendid jewels&mdash;</p>
<p>Flashing diamonds, like  fallen<br>
  Stars, for whose bright evil beauty<br>
  Blood in old days had been spilt that<br>
  Should have made them burn like rubies;</p>
<p>Emeralds greener than  Spring&rsquo;s garments,<br>
  Pearls like unto tears of Peris<br>
  Weeping by the gates of Eden;<br>
  Opals with their fateful lustre.</p>
<p>Long on these, and  countless other<br>
  Many-coloured gems, the Rajah<br>
  Gazed, but found no more delight in<br>
  Their sun-flashing brilliant beauty.</p>
<p>He had dreamt a dream  enchanting<br>
  Of twin-sapphires, blue as Heaven,<br>
  And his heart was filled with hunger<br>
  And with yearning to possess them.</p>
<p>Therefore unto his  Vizier he<br>
  Told his dream, and gave command that<br>
  He should seek the wide world over,<br>
  Till he found the wondrous sapphires.</p>
<p>Doth that sad Vizier  still wander<br>
  O&rsquo;er the earth the sapphires seeking?<br>
  Sooth, I know not&mdash;but I know that<br>
  He will never find them, never.</p>
<p>For they were no cold,  bright sapphires<br>
  That the Rajah in his dream saw&hellip;<br>
  Waking from my dream I knew that<br>
  They were thy blue eyes, Beloved!</p>

<p>THE wan light of a  stormy dawn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed on a tossing ship:<br>
  It was the <i>In Memoriam<br>
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a mourning trip.</p>
<p>Wild waves were on the  windward bow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breakers on the lee;<br>
  And through her sides the women heard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seething of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Captain!&rdquo; cried a  widow fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her plump white hands clasped she,<br>
  &ldquo;Thinkst thou, if drowned in this dread storm,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sav&egrave;d we shall be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak in riddles,  lady dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sav&egrave;d can we be<br>
  If we are drowned?&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas, I mean<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Paradise!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I&rsquo;ve sailed North,  and I&rsquo;ve sailed South&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He was a godless wight),<br>
  &ldquo;But boy or man, since my days began,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shore I ne&rsquo;er did sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain told the  First Mate bold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that fair lady said;<br>
  The First Mate sneered in his black beard&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes burned in his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full forty souls are  here aboard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-sailing on the wave&mdash;<br>
  Without the crew, and, &rsquo;twixt us two,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think <i>they&rsquo;ve </i>none  to save&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full forty souls, and  each one is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mourner, as you know.<br>
  They weep the scuppers full; the ship<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is waterlogged with woe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he sneered in his  black beard:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The cruise is not so brief,<br>
  But, ere we land on earthly strand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All will have found relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; the Captain  said, &ldquo;First Mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have forgotten one<br>
  With eyes of blue; the tears are true<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From those dear eyes that run!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She mourns her  sweetheart drowned last year,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seaman <i>he</i>,  forsooth!<br>
  I would not drown for Christ his crown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she were mine, Fair Ruth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave words! but  words,&rdquo; the First Mate cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are wind! Behold in me<br>
  The warmest lover and the last!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine shall the maiden be.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>Fair Ruth stood by the  taffrail high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cross dropped in the sea,<br>
  If you lie here, my sweetheart dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this remember me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fair Ruth stood by the  taffrail high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring dropped in the sea:<br>
  &ldquo;Marry him not, ye false mermaids,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Married he&rsquo;s now to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heavens flashed  flame; a black cloud came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its wings the sky did span,<br>
  And hovered above the fated ship<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like death o&rsquo;er a dying man.</p>
<p>Bended the spars and  shrieked the shrouds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sails flew from the mast,<br>
  And, like a soul by fiends pursued,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship fled through the blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More sail! more sail!&rdquo;  the First Mate cried<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Captain stood aghast),<br>
  &ldquo;More sail! more sail!&rdquo; and he laughed in scorn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All by the mizen mast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O brethren dear, there&rsquo;s  nought to fear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward told me so!&rdquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Twas the parson meek who thus did speak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just come up from below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>were </i>there,&rdquo; he said, with upraised head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hands clasped piously,<br>
  &ldquo;I have a sainted spouse in Heaven&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trow she waits for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then grimly laughed the  false First Mate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good parson, let her be!<br>
  I&rsquo;ve a wife in every port but <i>that</i>&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that we shall not see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pardon seek!&rdquo;  cried the parson meek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And pray, if pray you can,<br>
  For much I fear, by your scornful sneer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you are a sinful man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then louder laughed the  false First Mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louder and louder still,<br>
  And the wicked crew laughed loudly too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wicked seamen will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Captain!&rdquo; whispered  a gentle dame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When <i>shall </i>we  see the land?&rdquo;<br>
  The Captain answered never a word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But clasped her by the hand.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>Day after day, night  after night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On, on the ship did reel:<br>
  The Captain drank with the second mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Mate held the wheel.</p>
<p>Down came a black cloud  on the ship,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrapped her like a pall,<br>
  And horror of awful darkness fell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon them one and all.</p>
<p>The night had swallowed  them utterly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None could his fellow see,<br>
  But ghostly voices up and down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went whispering fearsomely.</p>
<p>No faint ray shone from  moon or sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of Heaven was gone,<br>
  But ever the First Mate held the wheel,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever the ship rushed on.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>Fair Ruth knelt down in  that grim gloom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She prayed beneath her breath:<br>
  &ldquo;God carry me o&rsquo;er this dread sea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems the Sea of Death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ceased&mdash;and lo! a  lurid glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er that dark water spread,<br>
  And in the blackness burned, afar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line of bloody red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What lights are yon?&rdquo;  the Captain said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Mate answered then:<br>
  &ldquo;No lights that ever shone upon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of living men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down on your knees!&rdquo;  the parson cried;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank God, for all is well!&rdquo;<br>
  The First Mate laughed: &ldquo;Those lights, they are<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harbour lights of Hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On flew the ship; to  every lip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ashen pallor came,<br>
  For all might see that suddenly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea had turned to flame.</p>
<p>The lights were near;  the Sea of Fear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the silence dire,<br>
  On that dread shore broke evermore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In soundless foam of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what are yon gray  ghosts and wan!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parson cried, &ldquo;who seem<br>
  With coloured strings of beads to play,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a dreadful dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damned souls;&rdquo; the  First Mate said; &ldquo;they sit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And count, through endless years,<br>
  The moments of Eternity<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On beads of burning tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;Who are you,&rdquo;  the parson said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That talk so free of Hell?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;My name is Satan,&rdquo; he replied,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have I not steered you well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back&mdash;back the yards!&rdquo;  the Captain cried<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then quoth the false First Mate:<br>
  &ldquo;Like many more who sight this shore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You back your yards too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the dear  deceased you mourned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such exceeding zest;<br>
  They call you&mdash;whoso freely goes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&rsquo;en yet may save the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One pale ghost waved  the vessel back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gestures sad and dumb&mdash;<br>
  Fair Ruth has plunged into the sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My love, my love, I come!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>All in a moment shone  the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue gleamed the sky and sea,<br>
  The brave old ship upon the waves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was dancing merrily.</p>
<p>And merrily to sound of  bells<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her old port full soon<br>
  The <i>In Memoriam </i>that went forth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returned the <i>Honeymoon</i>.</p>
<p>There o&rsquo;er their grog  sea-captains still<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wondrous story tell,<br>
  And how her Captain backed his yards<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A biscuit-throw from Hell.</p>

<p>And far inland for a  farewell pardon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew on and on, while the ship went South&mdash;<br>
  The rose was red in the red-rose garden,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And red the rose of your laughing mouth.</p>
<p>But no word came on the  wind in token<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love that lasts till the end; and so<br>
  My heart returned to me bruised and broken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From you, my love, of the long ago.</p>
<p>The green fields seemed  in the distance growing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To silken squares on a weaver&rsquo;s loom,<br>
  As oversea came the land-wind blowing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint sweet scent of the clover bloom.</p>
<p>A rarer odour to me it  carried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In subtle delicate way to tell<br>
  Of you, ere you and the world were married&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilac-odour you loved so well.</p>
<p>Again, I saw you  beneath the blooms of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those lilac-trees in the garden old.<br>
  Ah me! each tree is a mark for tombs of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead dreams and memories still and cold.</p>
<p>And Death comes there  with his breath scent-laden,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gathering gently the blossoms shed<br>
  (In guise of Autumn, the brown-browed maiden)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your and my dead buries his dead.</p>
<p>O, fairer far than the  fair ideal<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of him who imaged the foam-born Queen<br>
  In foam-white marble&mdash;a dream made real&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me were you in those years, I ween.</p>
<p>Your lips were redder  than night-shade berries<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That burn in borders of hedgerowed lanes,<br>
  And sweeter far than the sweet wild cherries<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The June sun flushes with crimson stains.</p>
<p>And gray your eyes as a  gray dove&rsquo;s wings were&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray soft-shadowing deeps profound,<br>
  Where thoughts that reached to the heart of things were,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love lay dreaming though seeming drowned.</p>
<p>Twin-tulip-breasted  like her the tread of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose feet made music in Paphos fair,<br>
  The world to me was not worth a thread of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your brown, ambrosial, braided hair.</p>
<p>Mayhap you loved me at  one time truly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was jealous, and you were proud;<br>
  But mine the love of the king in Thule,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Till death; </i>and  yours&mdash;sleeps well in shroud.</p>
<p>So night came down like  a sombre raven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And southward ever the ship was borne,<br>
  Till glad green fields and lessening haven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew faint and faded like ghosts at morn.</p>
<p>As fields of Heaven  eternal blooming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those flowerful fields of my mother-land<br>
  In midnight visions are still perfuming<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All wild waste places and seas of sand.</p>
<p>And still in seasons of  storm and thunder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In strange lands under your land and mine,<br>
  And though our ways have been wide asunder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calm and tempest and shade and shine</p>
<p>Your face I see as I  saw the last time&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one borne space-ward on wings of light,<br>
  With eyes turned back to a sight of past time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beholds for ever that self-same sight.</p>
<p>But scorn has died on  your lips, and through you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines out star-bright an immortal grace,<br>
  As though God then to His heaven drew you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sent an angel to take your place.</p>
<p>I plucked one rose from  the tree you cherished,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart&rsquo;s blood ebbing has kept it red,<br>
  And all my hopes with its scent have perished;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why mourn them now&mdash;are the dead not dead?</p>
<p>And yet, God knows, as  this rose I kiss, you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May feel the kisses across the sea;<br>
  And soul to soul for the larger issue<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your soul may stand with the soul of me,</p>
<p>Unknown to you&mdash;for the  strings of Being<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not so easily snapped or torn;<br>
  And we may journey with eyes unseeing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On paths that meet in the years unborn.</p>
<p>Farewell, dear heart.  Warm sighs may sever<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripe lips of love like a rose-leaf curled,<br>
  But you remain unto me for ever<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one fair woman in all the world.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a wicked, white-faced moon.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built in fashion quaint and old;<br>
  From her masthead, in the moonlight,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black with age her ropes and rails;<br>
  Like a ghost through cere-cloths gazing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone the white moon through her sails.</p>
<p>Not a movement stirred  the stillness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a sound the silence broke,<br>
  Save alone the livid water<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapping round her sides of oak.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who make for men a morning song of mirth<br>
  While yet the birds are dumb amid the gloom?</p>
<p>They walk on thorny  ways with feet unshod,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing one last song, and die as that song dies.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no human hand to close their eyes,<br>
  And very heavy is the hand of God.</p>

<p>IT was a day of sombre  heat:<br>
  The still, dense air was void of sound<br>
  And life; no wing of bird did beat<br>
  A little breeze through it&mdash;the ground<br>
  Was like live ashes to the feet.<br>
  From the black hills that loomed around<br>
  The valley many a sudden spire<br>
  Of flame shot up, and writhed, and curled,<br>
  And sank again for heaviness:<br>
  And heavy seemed to men that day<br>
  The burden of the weary world.<br>
  For evermore the sky did press<br>
  Closer upon the earth that lay<br>
  Fainting beneath, as one in dire<br>
  Dreams of the night, upon whose breast<br>
  Sits a black phantom of unrest<br>
  That holds him down. The earth and sky<br>
  Appeared unto the troubled eye<br>
  A roof of smoke, a floor of fire.</p>
<p>There was no water in  the land.<br>
  Deep in the night of each ravine<br>
  Men, vainly searching for it, found<br>
  Dry hollows in the gaping ground,<br>
  Like sockets where clear eyes had been,<br>
  Now burnt out with a burning brand.<br>
  There was no water in the land<br>
  But the salt sea tide, that did roll<br>
  Far past the places where, till then,<br>
  The sweet streams met and flung it back;<br>
  The beds of little brooks, that stole<br>
  In spring-time down each ferny glen,<br>
  And rippled over rock and sand,<br>
  Were drier than a cattle-track.<br>
  A dull, strange languor of disease,<br>
  That ever with the heat increased,<br>
  Fell upon man, and bird, and beast;<br>
  The thin-flanked cattle gasped for breath;<br>
  The birds dropped dead from drooping trees;<br>
  And men, who drank the muddy lees<br>
  From each near-dry though deep-dug well,<br>
  Grew faint; and over all things fell<br>
  A heavy stupor, dank as Death.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>Fierce Nature, glaring  with a face<br>
  Of savage scorn at my despair,<br>
  Withered my heart. From cone to base<br>
  The hills were full of hollow eyes<br>
  That rayed out darkness, dead and dull;<br>
  Gray rocks grinned under ridges bare,<br>
  Like dry teeth in a mouldered skull;<br>
  And ghastly gum-tree trunks did loom<br>
  Out of black clefts and rifts of gloom,<br>
  As sheeted spectres that arise<br>
  From yawning graves at dead of night<br>
  To fill the living with affright;<br>
  And, like to witches foul that bare<br>
  Their withered arms, and bend, and cast<br>
  Dread curses on the sleeping lands<br>
  In awful legends of the past,<br>
  Red gums, with outstretched bloody hands,<br>
  Shook maledictions in the air.</p>
<p>Fear was around me  everywhere:<br>
  The wrinkled foreheads of the rocks<br>
  Frowned on me, and methought I saw&mdash;<br>
  Deep down in dismal gulfs of awe,<br>
  Where gray death-adders have their lair,<br>
  With the fiend-bat, the flying-fox,<br>
  And dim sun-rays, down-groping far,<br>
  Pale as a dead man&rsquo;s fingers are&mdash;<br>
  The grisly image of Decay,<br>
  That at the root of Life doth gnaw,<br>
  Sitting alone upon a throne<br>
  Of rotting skull and bleaching bone.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an end to all  our griefs:<br>
  Little the red worm of the grave<br>
  Will vex us when our days are done.&rdquo;<br>
  So changed my thought: up-gazing then<br>
  On gray-piled stones that seemed the cairns<br>
  Of dead and long-forgotten chiefs&mdash;<br>
  The men of old, the poor wild men<br>
  Who, under dim lights, fought a brave,<br>
  Sad fight of Life, where hope was none,<br>
  In the vague, voiceless, far-off years&mdash;<br>
  It changed again to present pain,<br>
  And I saw Sorrow everywhere:<br>
  In blackened trees and rust-red ferns,<br>
  Blasted by bush-fires and the sun;<br>
  And by the salt-flood&mdash;salt as tears&mdash;<br>
  Where the wild apple-trees hung low,<br>
  And evermore stooped down to stare<br>
  At their drowned shadows in the wave,<br>
  Wringing their knotted hands of woe;<br>
  And the dark swamp-oaks, row on row,<br>
  Lined either bank&mdash;a sombre train<br>
  Of mourners with down-streaming hair.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all delights and days expire:<br>
  Down in the dim, sad West the sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is dying like a dying fire.</p>
<p>The fiercest lances of  his light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are spent; I watch him droop and die<br>
  Like a great king who falls in fight;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None dared the duel of his eye<br>
  Living, but, now his eye is dim,<br>
  The eyes of all may stare at him.</p>
<p>How lovely in his  strength at morn<br>
  He orbed along the burning blue!<br>
  The blown gold of his flying hair<br>
  Was tangled in green-tress&egrave;d trees,<br>
  And netted in the river sand<br>
  In gleaming links of amber clear;<br>
  But all his shining locks are shorn,<br>
  His brow of its bright crown is bare,<br>
  The golden sceptre leaves his hand,<br>
  And deeper, darker, grows the hue<br>
  Of the dim purple draperies<br>
  And cloudy banners round his bier.</p>
<p>O beautiful,  rose-hearted dawn!&mdash;<br>
  O splendid noon of gold and blue!&mdash;<br>
  Is this wan glimmer all of you?<br>
  Where are the blush and bloom ye gave<br>
  To laughing land and smiling sea?&mdash;<br>
  The swift lights that did flash and shiver<br>
  In diamond rain upon the river,<br>
  And set a star in each blue wave?<br>
  Where are the merry lights and shadows<br>
  That danced through wood and over lawn,<br>
  And flew across the dewy meadows<br>
  Like white nymphs chased by satyr lovers?<br>
  Faded and perished utterly.</p>
<p>All delicate and all  rich colour<br>
  In flower and cloud, on lawn and lea,<br>
  On butterfly, and bird, and bee,<br>
  A little space and all are gone&mdash;<br>
  And darkness, like a raven, hovers<br>
  Above the death-bed of the day.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>So, when the long, last  night draws on,<br>
  And all the world grows ghastly gray,<br>
  We see our beautiful and brave<br>
  Wither, and watch with heavy sighs<br>
  The life-light dying in their eyes,<br>
  The love-light slowly fading out,<br>
  Leaving no faint hope in their place,<br>
  But only on each dear wan face<br>
  The shadow of a weary doubt,<br>
  The ashen pallor of the grave.</p>
<p>O gracious morn and  golden noon!<br>
  With what fair dreams did ye depart&mdash;<br>
  Beloved so well and lost so soon!<br>
  I could not fold you to my breast:<br>
  I could not hide you in my heart;<br>
  I saw the watchers in the West&mdash;<br>
  Sad, shrouded shapes, with hands that wring<br>
  And phantom fingers beckoning!</p>

  Fade slowly from the last gray height,<br>
  And leave no gloomy cloud to grieve<br>
  The heart of this enchanted eve!</p>
<p>All things beneath the  still sky seem<br>
  Bound by the spell of a sweet dream;<br>
  In the dusk forest, dreamingly,<br>
  Droops slowly down each plum&egrave;d head;<br>
  The river flowing softly by<br>
  Dreams of the sea; the quiet sea<br>
  Dreams of the unseen stars; and I<br>
  Am dreaming of the dreamless dead.</p>
<p>The river has a silken  sheen,<br>
  But red rays of the sunset stain<br>
  Its pictures, from the steep shore caught,<br>
  Till shades of rock, and fern, and tree<br>
  Glow like the figures on a pane<br>
  Of some old church by twilight seen,<br>
  Or like the rich devices wrought<br>
  In mediaeval tapestry.</p>
<p>All lonely in a  drifting boat<br>
  Through shine and shade I float and float,<br>
  Dreaming and dreaming, till I seem<br>
  Part of the picture and the dream.</p>
<p>There is no sound to  break the spell,<br>
  No voice of bird or stir of bough;<br>
  Only the lisp of waters wreathing<br>
  In little ripples round the prow,<br>
  And a low air, like Silence breathing,<br>
  That hardly dusks the sleepy swell<br>
  Whereon I float to that strange deep<br>
  That sighs upon the shores of Sleep.</p>

  The flower of fantasy, perfuming<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With subtle melody of scent<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Death still feared to touch thine eyes,<br>
  Where such immortal light was glowing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of eternity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pearly gates of Paradise!</p>
<p>Now richer hues the  skies illume:<br>
  The pale gold blushes into bloom,<br>
  Delicate as the flowering<br>
  Of first love in the tender spring<br>
  Of Life, when love is wizardry<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rose of passionate desire<br>
  Lone burning in a lonely heart.</p>
<p>A lonely heart; a  lonely flood.<br>
  The wave that glassed her gleaming head<br>
  And smiling passed, it does not know<br>
  That gleaming head lies dark and low;<br>
  The myrtle-tree that bends above,<br>
  I pray that it may early bud,<br>
  For under its green boughs sat we&mdash;<br>
  We twain, we only, hand in hand,<br>
  When Love was lord of all the land&mdash;<br>
  It does not know that she is dead<br>
  And all is over now with Love,<br>
  Is over now with Love and me.</p>
<p>Once more, once more, O  shining years<br>
  Gone by; once more, O vanished days<br>
  Whose hours flew by on iris-wings,<br>
  Come back and bring my love to me!<br>
  My voice faints down the wooded ways<br>
  And dies along the darkling flood.<br>
  The past is past; I cry in vain,<br>
  For when did Death an answer deign<br>
  To Love&rsquo;s heart-broken questionings?<br>
  The dead are deaf; dust chokes their ears;<br>
  Only the rolling river hears<br>
  Far off the calling of the sea&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou blackenest the white moonbeams;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To death, as He in His chill heaven heard<br>
  Her voice so sweeter than His seraph&rsquo;s song.</p>
<p>And so Death took away  her flower-sweet breath<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One darkest day of days in a dark year, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought to that strong God who had no dear<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hour by hour awake would lie,<br>
  And watch the white moon gliding slow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along her pathway in the sky.</p>
<p>And every night as thus  he lay<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entranced in lonely fantasy,<br>
  Borne swiftly on a bright moon-ray<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came to him a Golden Key.</p>
<p>And with that Golden  Key the Boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oped every night a magic door<br>
  That to a melody of Joy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned on its hinges evermore.</p>
<p>Then, trembling with  delight and awe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he the charm&egrave;d threshold crossed,<br>
  A radiant corridor he saw&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its end in dazzling distance lost.</p>
<p>Great windows shining  in a row<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit up the wondrous corridor,<br>
  And each its own rich light did throw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stream resplendent on the floor.</p>
<p>One window showed the  Boy a scene<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a forest old and dim,<br>
  Where fairies danced upon the green<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed their little hands to him.</p>
<p>Sweet strains of elfin  harp and horn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard so clearly sounding there,<br>
  And he to Wonderland was borne<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathed its soft enchanted air.</p>
<p>Then, passing onward with  the years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his back on Elf and Fay,<br>
  And sadly sweet, as if in tears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairy music died away.</p>
<p>The second window held  him long:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked upon a field of fight<br>
  Whereon the countless hordes of Wrong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fought fiercely with the friends of Right.</p>
<p>And, lo! upon that  fateful field,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where cannon thundered, banners streamed,<br>
  And rushing squadrons rocked and reeled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sword a star of battle gleamed.</p>
<p>And when the hordes of  Wrong lay still,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that great fight was fought and won,<br>
  He stood, bright-eyed, upon a hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white plume shining in the sun.</p>
<p>A glorious vision! yet  behind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left it with its scarlet glow,<br>
  And faint and far upon the wind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the martial trumpets blow.</p>
<p>For to his listening  ear was borne<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A music more entrancing far<br>
  Than strains of elfin harp or horn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More thrilling than the trump of war.</p>
<p>No longer as a dreamy  boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trod the radiant corridor:<br>
  His young man&rsquo;s heart presaged a joy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More dear than all the joys of yore.</p>
<p>To that third window,  half in awe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved, and slowly raised his eyes&mdash;<br>
  And was it earth grown young he saw?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or was it man&rsquo;s lost Paradise?</p>
<p>For all the flowers  that ever bloomed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the earth, and all the rare<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he by turns grew passion-pale.<br>

  &ldquo;I am this country&rsquo;s queen&mdash;and thou?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am thy vassal,&rdquo; murmured he.</p>
<p>She hid him with her  hair gold-red,<br>

  She kissed him on the lips, and said:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dear heart! I&rsquo;ve waited long for thee.&rdquo;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So gracious was her beauty bright,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulsed tremulously with delight.</p>

  The flames leap up and expire;<br>

<p>THE curtain rose&mdash;the  play began&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limelight on the gay garbs shone;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet carelessly I gazed upon<br>
  The painted players, maid and man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one with idle eyes who sees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marble figures on a frieze.</p>
<p>Long lark-notes clear  the first act close,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the soprano: then a hush&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenor, tender as a thrush;<br>
  Then loud and high the chorus rose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, with a sudden rush and strong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ended in a storm of song.</p>
<p>The curtain fell&mdash;the  music died&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights grew bright, revealing there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flash of jewelled fingers fair,<br>
  And wreaths of pearls on brows of pride;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with a quick-flushed cheek, I turned,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into mine her dark eyes burned.</p>
<p>Such eyes but once a  man may see,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, seeing once, his fancy dies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thought of any other eyes:<br>
  So shadow-soft, they seemed to be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twin haunted lakes, lit by the gleams<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a mysterious moon of dreams.</p>
<p>Silk lashes veiled  their liquid light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a shade as tall reeds fling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lake-marge at sunsetting:<br>
  Their darkness might have hid the night&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet whoso saw their glance would say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night dreamt therein, and saw the day.</p>
<p>Long looked I at them,  wondering<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What tender memories were hid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath each blue-veined lily-lid;<br>
  What hopes of joys the years would bring;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What griefs? In vain: I might not guess<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of their silentness.</p>
<p>What of her face? Her  face, meseems,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was such as painters see who muse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By moonlight in dim avenues,<br>
  Yet cannot paint; or as in dreams,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young poets see, but, when they try<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To limn in verse are dumb&mdash;so I.</p>
<p>Yet well I know that I  have seen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sweet face in the long ago<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a rose-bower&mdash;well I know&mdash;<br>
  Laughing the singing leaves between,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that strange land of rose and rhyme&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of Once upon a Time.</p>
<p>O unknown sweet, so  sweetly known,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not what your name may be&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madonna is your name for me&mdash;<br>
  Nor where your lines in life are thrown;<br>

<p>Did your young bosom  never glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To love? or burns your heart beneath<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As burns the rosebud in its sheath?<br>
  I neither know nor wish to know:<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will may pluck and wear, for me&mdash;</p>
<p>May wear the rose, and  watch it die,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, leaf by red leaf, fade and fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till there be nothing left at all<br>
  Of its sweet loveliness; but I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love it so well, I leave it free&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On me, when dreaded ghosts arise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dead regrets with shrouded eyes,<br>
  And phantoms of the perished past,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old thoughts, old hopes, and old desire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather around my lonely fire!</p>

<p>ONCE a poet&mdash;long ago&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrote a song as void of art<br>
  As the songs that children know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as pure as a child&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>With a sigh he threw it  down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, &ldquo;This will never shed<br>
  Any glory or renown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my name when I am dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will sing a lordly  song<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men shall hear, when I am gone,<br>
  Through the years sound clear and strong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a golden clarion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So this lordly song he  sang<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would gain him deathless fame&mdash;<br>
  When the death-knell o&rsquo;er him rang<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man even knew its name.</p>
<p>Ay, and when his way he  found<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the place of singing souls,<br>
  And beheld their bright heads crowned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With song-woven aureoles,</p>
<p>He stood shame-faced in  the throng,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his brow of wreath was bare,<br>
  And, alas! his lordly song<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sere had grown in that sweet air;</p>
<p>Then, all sudden, a  divine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light fell on him from afar,<br>
  And he felt the child-song shine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his forehead like a star.</p>
<p>So for ever. Each and  all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of passion or of mirth<br>
  That are not heart-pure shall fall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sky-lark&rsquo;s&mdash;to the earth;</p>
<p>But the soul&rsquo;s song has  no bounds&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the voice of Israfel,<br>
  From the heaven of heavens it sounds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the very hell of hell.</p>

<p>For all its fine,  melodious curves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With life a-quiver<br>
  Were graceful as the bends and swerves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her own river.</p>
<p>Her round arms, from  the shoulders down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sweet hands slender,<br>
  The sun had kissed them amber-brown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With kisses tender.</p>
<p>For though she loved  the secret shades<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where ferns grow stilly,<br>
  And wild vines droop their glossy braids,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gleams the lily,</p>
<p>And Nature, with soft  eyes that glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gloom that glistens,<br>
  Unto her own heart, beating slow,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do her honour,<br>
  As in that rosy morning glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gazed upon her.</p>
<p>My boat swung bowward  to the stream<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where tall reeds shiver;<br>
  We floated onward, in a dream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far down the River.</p>
<p>The River that full oft  has told<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Ocean hoary<br>
  A many-coloured, sweet, and old<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unending story:</p>
<p>The story of the tall,  young trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever sighing<br>
  To sail some day the rolling seas<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Neath banners flying.</p>
<p>The Ocean hears, and  through his caves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roars gusty laughter;<br>
  And takes the River, with his waves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To roll thereafter.</p>
<p>But Love deep waters  cannot drown;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To its old fountains<br>
  The stream returns in clouds that crown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its parent mountains.</p>
<p>The River was to her so  dear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seemed its daughter;<br>
  Her deep translucent eyes were clear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sunlit water;</p>
<p>And in her bright veins  seemed to run,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulsating, glowing,<br>
  The music of the wind and sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waters flowing.</p>
<p>The secrets of the  trees she knew:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their growth, their gladness,<br>
  And, when their time of death was due,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their stately sadness.</p>
<p>Gray gums, like old men  warped by time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew their story;<br>
  And theirs that laughed in pride of prime<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leafy glory;</p>
<p>And theirs that, where  clear waters run,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drooped dreaming, dreaming;<br>
  And theirs that shook against the sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their green plumes gleaming.</p>
<p>All things of gladness  that exist<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did seem to woo her,<br>
  And well that woodland satirist,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lyre-bird, knew her.</p>
<p>And there were hidden  mossy dells<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she knew only,<br>
  Where Beauty born of silence dwells<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious, lonely.</p>
<p>No sounds of toil their  stillness taunt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hearth-smoke sullies<br>
  The air: the Mountain Muses haunt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those lone, green gullies.</p>
<p>And there they weave a  song of Fate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never slumbers:<br>
  A song some bard shall yet translate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In golden numbers.</p>
<p>A blue haze veiled the  hills&rsquo; huge shapes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A misty lustre&mdash;<br>
  Like rime upon the purple grapes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ripe they cluster:</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An El Dorado:<br>
  The damask river seaward rolled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through shine and shadow.</p>
<p>And, gazing on its  changing glow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw, half-sighing,<br>
  The wondrous Fairyland below<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its surface lying.</p>
<p>There all things shone  with paler sheen:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More softly shimmered<br>
  The fern-fronds, and with softer green<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The myrtles glimmered:</p>
<p>And&mdash;like that Fisher  gazing in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-depths, pining<br>
  For days gone by, who saw Julin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath him shining,</p>
<p>With many a wave-washed  corridor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sea-filled portal,<br>
  And plunged below, and nevermore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was seen of mortal&mdash;</p>
<p>So I, long gazing at  the gleam<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fern and flower,<br>
  Felt drawn down to that World of Dream<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By magic power:</p>
<p>For there, I knew, in  silence sat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With breasts slow-heaving,<br>
  Illusion&rsquo;s Queen Rabesquerat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her web a-weaving.</p>
<p>But when the moon  shone, large and low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against Orion,<br>
  Then, as from some pale portico<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might issue Dian,</p>
<p>She came through tall  tree-pillars pale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver vision,<br>
  A nymph strayed out of Ida&rsquo;s vale<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or fields Elysian.</p>
<p>White stars shone out  with mystic gleams<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods illuming:<br>
  It seemed as if the trees in dreams<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more were blooming.</p>
<p>And all beneath those  starry blooms,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By bends and beaches,<br>
  We floated on through glassy glooms,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down moonlit reaches.</p>
<p>Ah, that was in the  glad years when<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joys ne&rsquo;er were sifted,<br>
  But I on wilder floods since then<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have darkly drifted.</p>

<p>And still I hear, thy  shores along,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All faintly ringing,<br>
  The notes of ghosts of birds that long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have ceased their singing.</p>
<p>Was she, who then my  heart did use<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch so purely,<br>
  A mortal maiden&mdash;or a Muse?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not, surely.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDreamofMargaret"></a>The Dream of Margaret</b></h2>
<p>IT fell upon a summer  night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village folk were soundly sleeping,<br>
  Unconscious of the glamour white<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which the moon all things was steeping;<br>
  One window only showed a light;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind it, silent vigil keeping,<br>
  Sat Margaret, as one in trance&mdash;<br>
  The dark-eyed daughter of the Manse.</p>
<p>A flood of strange,  sweet thoughts was surging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her passionate heart and brain within.<br>
  At last, some secret impulse urging,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laid aside her garment thin,<br>
  And from its snowy folds emerging,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Lamia  from the serpent-skin,<br>
  She stood before her mirror bright<br>
  Naked, and lovely as the night.</p>
<p>Her dark hair o&rsquo;er her  shoulders flowing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might well have been a silken pall<br>
  O&rsquo;er Galatea&rsquo;s image glowing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To life and love: she was withal&mdash;<br>
  The lamplight o&rsquo;er her radiance throwing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her high bosom virginal,<br>
  A woman made to madden men,<br>
  A Cleopatra born again.</p>
<p>Hers was the beauty  dark and splendid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose spell upon the heart of man<br>
  Falls swiftly as, when day is ended,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night falls in lands Australian.<br>
  Her rich, ripe, scarlet lips, bow-bended,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled as such ripe lips only can;<br>
  Her eyes, wherein strange lightnings shone,<br>
  Were deeper than Oblivion.</p>
<p>With round, white arms,  whose warm caress<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No lover knew, raised towards the ceiling,<br>
  She looked like some young Pythoness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secrets dark of Fate revealing,<br>
  Or goddess in divine distress<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To higher powers for help appealing.<br>
  This invocation, standing so,<br>
  She sang in clear, sweet tones, but low:</p>
<p><i>Soul, from  this narrow</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mean life we know</i>,<br>
  <i>Speed as an arrow<br>
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>From bended  bow!</i></p>
<p><i>Seek, and  discover</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>On land or sea</i>,<br>
  <i>My destined lover</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Where&rsquo;er he be</i>.</p>
<p><i>How shalt  thou know him</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>My heart&rsquo;s desire?</i>&mdash;<br>
  <i>His mien will show him</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>His glance of fire</i>.</p>
<p><i>High is his  bearing</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>His pride is high</i>,<br>
  <i>His spirit daring<br>
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Burns in his  eye</i>.</p>
<p><i>Birds have  done mating;<br>
  </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Spring is  past;<br>
    My arms are waiting</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>My heart beats fast</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why,&rdquo; she sighed,  &ldquo;has Fate awarded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lot to me whose heart is bold?<br>
  My days by trifles are recorded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suitors men whose God is gold.<br>
  Oh for the Heroes helmed and sworded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovers of the days of old,<br>
  Who broke for ladies many a lance<br>
  In gallant days of old Romance!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I had lived in  that great time when<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady&rsquo;s love was knight&rsquo;s best boon;<br>
  When sword with sword made ringing rhyme, when<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mailed sea-kings fought from noon to moon,<br>
  And thought the slaughter grim no crime, when<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prize was golden-haired Gudrun.<br>
  Then <i>I </i>might find swords, broad and bright<br>
  And keen as theirs, for me to fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But narrow bounds my  life environ,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold my eager spirit in.<br>
  The men I see no heart of fire in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bodies bear. My love to win<br>
  A man must have a will of iron,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soul of flame. Then sweet were sin<br>
  Or Death for him!&rdquo; With ardent glance<br>
  Thus spake the daughter of the Manse.</p>
<p>Then, with a smile, she  fell asleep in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her white and dainty maiden bed.<br>
  The chaste, cold moon alone could peep in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And view her tresses dark outspread<br>
  Upon an arm whose clasp might keep in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of one given up for dead:<br>
  And, as she drifted down the stream<br>
  Of Slumber deep, she dreamt a dream.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>It was a banquet rich  and rare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine of France was foaming madly;<br>
  The proud and great of earth were there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all were slaves to serve her gladly,<br>
  And yet on them with haughty air<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gazed, half-scornfully, half-sadly;<br>
  The Lady of the Feast was she&mdash;<br>
  So ran her strange dream-fantasy.</p>
<p>A Prince was at her  fair right hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at her left a famous leader<br>
  Of hosts, with look of high command,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;blacker than the tents of Kedar&mdash;<br>
  An Eastern King, barbaric, grand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat near&mdash;their Queen they had decreed her.<br>
  Below the proud, the brave, the wise,<br>
  Sat charmed by her mesmeric eyes.</p>
<p>Then thus she spake: &ldquo;O  Lords of Earth!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than you I know none nobler, braver;<br>
  And yet your fame, and rank, and birth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wealth in <i>my </i>sight  find small favour,<br>
  For all too well I know their worth&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long since for me they lost their savour.<br>
  The Spirit, fit to mate with mine,<br>
  Must be demoniac&mdash;or divine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A toast!&rdquo; she cried.  The gallant throng<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang up, their foaming glasses clinking.<br>
  &ldquo;Satan! The Spirit proud and strong!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bravest lover to <i>my </i>thinking!<br>
  The Wine of Life I&rsquo;ve drunk too long:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wine of death I now am drinking!&rdquo; &hellip;<br>
  &ldquo;Our Queen she was a moment since&mdash;<br>
  Bear forth the body!&rdquo; said the Prince.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>A ghostly wind arose,  all wet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tears, and full of cries and wailing,<br>
  And wringing hands, and faces set<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bitter anguish unavailing;<br>
  It bore the soul of Margaret<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where a voice, in tones of railing,<br>
  Cried, &ldquo;Spirit proud, thou hast done well!<br>
  Thou art within the Gates of Hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soul of Margaret  passed slowly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet bravely, through the Hall of Dread,<br>
  The roof whereof was hidden wholly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By black clouds hanging overhead.<br>
  No sound disturbed the melancholy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep silence&mdash;which itself seemed dead.<br>
  No wailing of the damned was heard,<br>
  No voice the fearful stillness stirred.</p>
<p>But that deep silence  held in keeping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of Eternal Woe&mdash;<br>
  That yet seemed like a serpent creeping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the walls. It was as though<br>
  The cries of pain and hopeless weeping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had died out ages long ago.<br>
  No face was seen, no figure dread&hellip;<br>
  Were all the damned and devils dead?</p>
<p>No lustre known on  earth was gleaming<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that dread Hall, but some weird light<br>
  Around the pillars vast was streaming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the vistas infinite;<br>
  A light like that men see in dreaming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, waking, shudder with affright.<br>
  Its glare a baleful splendour shed<br>
  For ever through the Hall of Dread.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she was  aware<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That from the walls, and all around her,<br>
  In motionless and burning stare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of eyes glowed, that spellbound her:<br>
  The everlasting dumb despair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That spoke from them made Pity founder;<br>
  And, as she passed along the floor,<br>
  She trod on burning millions more.</p>
<p>For floor and pillar,  roof and all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were full of eyes, for ever burning&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas these that lit the Dreadful Hall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the damned beyond returning,<br>
  Sealed up in pillar, floor, and wall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a tongue to voice their yearning,<br>
  Or grief, or hate, so God might know:<br>
  Their eyes alone could speak their woe.</p>
<p>Her way lit by the  weird light flowing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From those sad, awful eyes, she passed<br>
  To where&mdash;her terror ever growing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a Throne, in fire set fast,<br>
  And like a Rose of fire far-glowing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw a Figure, Veiled and Vast.<br>
  She trembled, for she knew full well<br>
  She stood before the Lord of Hell.</p>
<p>And then, an instant  courage taking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knelt before the burning throne,<br>
  And, all her hopes of heaven forsaking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cried, &ldquo;O Lord, make me thine own!<br>
  For men, though they be of God&rsquo;s making,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love not. Thee I love alone.&rdquo;<br>
  The figure veiled spake thus: &ldquo;Arise,<br>
  O Spirit proud&mdash;and most unwise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as It spake,  unveiling slowly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brow of awful beauty shone<br>
  On Margaret&rsquo;s soul&mdash;yet Melancholy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Woe Eternal sat thereon.<br>
  But, lo! the form was woman wholly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint smile played her lips upon,<br>
  As in a voice low, sweet, and level<br>
  She said: &ldquo;My dear, <i>I </i>am  the Devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one wild wail of  bitter scorning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stricken soul of Margaret fled,<br>
  Sore harrowed by that dreadful warning;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, shrieking, through the Hall of Dread<br>
  She passed &hellip; and woke &hellip; and it was morning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was in her own white bed.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the  tale runs, she<br>
  Took veil within a nunnery.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So went they, side by side;</p>
<p>Until the fierce sun,  like an eyeball bloody<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eclipsed in death, was seen<br>
  No more, and in the spacious West, still ruddy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A star shone out serene.</p>
<p>As one, then, whom some  memory beguiling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May gladden, yea, and grieve,<br>
  The stranger, pointing up, said, sadly smiling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The Star of Christmas Eve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy replied not. Unto  him the sky was<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>All </i>reeling  stars; his breath<br>
  Came thick and fast; and life an empty lie was;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True one thing only&mdash;Death.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>Beneath the moonlight,  with the weird, wan glitter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of salt-bush all around,<br>
  He lay; but by his side in that dark, bitter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last hour, a friend he found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s </i>acted more than square, mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By me in this&mdash;and <i>I&rsquo;m<br>
  </i>A Rip&hellip; He must have known I was&mdash;well, there, mate&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A White Man all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s Christmas  day: God knows where <i>I&rsquo;ll </i>be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By then&mdash;I don&rsquo;t; but you<br>
  Away from this Death&rsquo;s hole should many a mile be,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Blake&rsquo;s, on the Barcoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take this cheque  there&mdash;they will cash it, sonny&hellip;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It meant my Christmas spree&hellip;<br>
  And do just what you like best with the money,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In memory of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger, smiling,  with a little leaven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of irony, said, &ldquo;Yea,<br>
  But <i>there </i>it shall not be. With <i>me </i>in Heaven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll spend your Christmas Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then that gray heathen,  that old back-block stager,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-jestingly replied,<br>
  And laughed&mdash;and laughed again&mdash;&ldquo;Mate, it&rsquo;s a wager!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, grimly laughing, died.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>St. Peter stood at the  Celestial Portal,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing down gulfs of air,<br>
  When Andy Blane, no longer now a mortal,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeared before him there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What seek&rsquo;st thou  here?&rdquo; the saint in tone ironic<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said. &ldquo;Surely the wrong gate<br>
  This is for thee.&rdquo; Andy replied, laconic,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to find my mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gates flew wide.  The glory unbeholden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mortal eyes was there.<br>
  He gazed&mdash;this trembling sinner&mdash;at the golden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrones, terrible and fair,</p>
<p>And shuddered. Then  down through the living splendour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came One unto the gate<br>
  Who said, with outspread hands, in accents tender:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Andy! <i>I </i>am  your mate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheOldWifeandtheNew"></a>The Old Wife and the New</b></h2>
<p>HE sat beneath the  curling vines<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That round the gay verandah twined,<br>
  His forehead seamed with sorrow&rsquo;s lines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man with a weary mind.</p>
<p>His young wife, with a  rosy face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brown arms ambered by the sun,<br>
  Went flitting all about the place&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master and mistress both in one.</p>
<p>What caused that old  man&rsquo;s look of care?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she not blithe and fair to see?<br>
  What blacker than her raven hair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What darker than her eyes might be?</p>
<p>The old man bent his  weary head;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunlight on his gray hair shone;<br>
  His thoughts were with a woman dead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buried, years and years agone:</p>
<p>The good old wife who  took her stand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him at the altar-side,<br>
  And walked with him, hand clasped in hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through joy and sorrow till she died.</p>
<p>Ah, she was fair as  heart&rsquo;s desire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gay, and supple-limbed, in truth,<br>
  And in his veins there leapt like fire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot red blood of lusty youth.</p>
<p>She stood by him in  shine and shade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when hard-beaten at his best,<br>
  She took him like a child and laid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His aching head upon her breast.</p>
<p>She helped him make a  little home<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where once were gum-trees gaunt and stark,<br>
  And bloodwoods waved green-feathered foam&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working from dawn of day to dark,</p>
<p>Till that dark forest  formed a frame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For vineyards that the gods might bless,<br>
  And what was savage once became<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Eden in the wilderness.</p>
<p>And how at their first  vintage-time<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed and sang&mdash;you see such shapes<br>
  On vases of the Grecian prime&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And danced a reel upon the grapes!</p>
<p>And ever, as the years  went on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things she kept with thrifty hand,<br>
  Till never shone the sun upon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fairer homestead in the land.</p>
<p>Then children came&mdash;ah,  me! ah, me!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad blessings that a mother craves!<br>
  That old man from his seat could see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows playing o&rsquo;er their graves.</p>
<p>And then she closed her  eyes at last,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gentle, useful, peaceful life<br>
  Was over&mdash;garnered with the past;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God rest thee gently, Good Old Wife!</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>His young wife has a  rosy face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laughs, with reddest lips apart,<br>
  But cannot fill the empty place<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within that old man&rsquo;s lonely heart.</p>
<p>His young wife has a  rosy face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brown arms ambered by the sun,<br>
  Goes flitting all about the place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master and mistress both in one;</p>
<p>But though she sings, or  though she sighs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees her not&mdash;he sees instead<br>
  A gray-haired Shade with gentle eyes&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good old wife, long dead, long dead.</p>
<p>He sits beneath the  curling vines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which the merry sunrays dart,<br>
  His forehead seamed with sorrow&rsquo;s lines&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man with a broken heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AChristmasEve"></a>A Christmas Eve</b></h2>
<p>GOOD fellows are  laughing and drinking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To-night no heart should grieve),<br>
  But I am of old days thinking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, on Christmas Eve.<br>
  Old memories fast are springing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To life again; old rhymes<br>
  Once more in my brain are ringing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, God be with old times!</p>
<p>There never was man so  lonely<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ghosts walked him beside,<br>
  For Death our spirits can only<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By veils of sense divide.<br>
  Numberless as the blades of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grass in the fields that grow,<br>
  Around us hover the shades of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead of long ago.</p>
<p>Friends living a word  estranges;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We smile, and we say &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo;<br>
  But, whatsoever else changes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead friends are faithful and true.<br>
  An old-time tune, or a flower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest thing held dear<br>
  In bygone days has the power<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more to bring them near.</p>
<p>And whether it be  through thinking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of memories sad and sweet,<br>
  Or hearing the cheery clinking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of glasses across the street,<br>
  I know not; but this is certain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, here in the dusk, I view<br>
  Like shadows seen through a curtain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shades of the friends I knew.</p>
<p>Methinks that I hear  their laughter&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An echo of ghostly mirth,<br>
  As if in the dim Hereafter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They jest as they did on earth.<br>
  The fancy possibly droll is,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet it relieves my mind<br>
  To think the enfranchised soul is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So humorously inclined.</p>
<p>But hark! whose steps  in the glancing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moonbeams are these I hear,<br>
  That sound as if timed to dancing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music of gallant cheer!<br>
  Half Galahad, half Don Juan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head full of wild romance;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas thus that of old would Spruhan<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come lilting, &ldquo;We met by chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure never a spirit  lighter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At heart quaffed mountain dew;<br>
  Never was goblin brighter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Oberon&rsquo;s kingdom knew.<br>
  And though at this season yearly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss the grasp of his hand,<br>
  I know that Spruhan has merely<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone back to Fairyland.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>The shades grow dimmer  and dimmer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they fade from view,<br>
  I see in the East the glimmer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dawn. Old friends, adieu!<br>
  Sitting here, lonely hearted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing these random rhymes.<br>
  I drink to the days departed,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, God be with old times!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Night"></a>Night</b></h2>
<p>THE Night is young yet;  an enchanted night<br>
  In early summer: calm and darkly bright.</p>
<p>I love the Night, and  every little breeze<br>
  She brings, to soothe the sleep of dreaming trees.</p>
<p>Hearst thou the Voices?  Sough! Susurrus!&mdash; Hark!<br>
  &rsquo;Tis Mother Nature whispering in the dark!</p>
<p>Burden of cities, mad  turmoil of men,<br>
  That vex the daylight&mdash;she forgets them then.</p>
<p>Her breasts are bare;  Grief gains from them surcease:<br>
  She gives her restless sons the milk of Peace.</p>
<p>To sleep she lulls  them&mdash;drawn from thoughts of pelf&mdash;<br>
  By telling sweet old stories of herself.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>All secrets deep&mdash;yea,  all I hear and see<br>
  Of things mysterious&mdash;Night reveals to me.</p>
<p>I know what every  flower, with drowsy head<br>
  Down-drooping, dreams of&mdash;and the seeming dead.</p>
<p>I know how they,  escaped from care and strife,<br>
  Ironically moralise on Life.</p>
<p>And know what&mdash;when the  moon walks on the waves&mdash;<br>
  They whisper to each other in their graves.</p>
<p>I know that white  clouds drifting from stark coasts<br>
  Across the sky at midnight are the ghosts</p>
<p>Of sailors drowned at  sea, who yearn to win<br>
  A quiet grave beside their kith and kin</p>
<p>In still green  graveyards, where they lie at ease<br>
  Far from the sound of surge and roar of seas.</p>
<p>I know the message of  the mournful rain<br>
  That beats upon the widow&rsquo;s window-pane.</p>
<p>I know the meaning of the  roar of seas;<br>
  I know the glad Spring sap-song of the trees;</p>
<p>And that great chant to  which in tuneful grooves<br>
  The green round earth upon its axis moves;</p>
<p>And that still greater  chant the Bright Sun sings&mdash;<br>
  Fire-crowned Apollo&mdash;the great chant that brings</p>
<p>All things to life, and  draws through spaces dim,<br>
  And star-sown realms, his planets after him.</p>
<p>I know the tune that  led, since Life began,<br>
  The upward, downward, onward March of Man.</p>
<p>I hear the whispers  that the Angels twain<br>
  Of Death and Life exchange in meeting&mdash;fain</p>
<p>Are they to pause and  greet, yet may not stay.<br>
  &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; &ldquo;For ever.&rdquo; This is all they say.</p>
<p>I hear the twitterings  inarticulate<br>
  Of souls unborn that press around the Gate</p>
<p>Of Birth, each striving  which shall first escape<br>
  From formless vapour into human shape.</p>
<p>I know the tale the  bird of passionate heart,<br>
  The nightingale, tries ever to impart</p>
<p>To men, though  vainly&mdash;for I well believe<br>
  That in her brown breast beats the heart of Eve,</p>
<p>Who with her sweet,  sad, wistful music tries<br>
  To tell her sons of their lost Paradise,</p>
<p>And solemn secrets Man  had grace to know,<br>
  When God walked in the Garden long ago.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>Yea, I have seen,  methought, on nights of awe,<br>
  The vision terrible Lucretius saw:</p>
<p>The trembling  Universe&mdash;suns, stars, grief, bliss&mdash;<br>
  Plunging for ever down a black abyss.</p>
<p>But more I love good  Bishop Jeremy,<br>
  Who likens all the star-worlds that we see&mdash;</p>
<p>Which seem to run an  everlasting race&mdash;<br>
  Unto a snowstorm sweeping on through space.</p>
<p>Suns, planets, stars,  in glorious array<br>
  They march, melodious, on their unknown way.</p>
<p>Thought, seraph-winged  and swifter than the light,<br>
  Unto the dim verge of the Infinite,</p>
<p>Pursues them, through  that strange ethereal flood<br>
  In which they swim (mayhap it is the blood</p>
<p>Of Universal God  wherein they are<br>
  But corpuscles&mdash;sun, satellite, and star&mdash;</p>
<p>And their great stream  of glory but a dim,<br>
  Small pulse in the remotest vein of Him)</p>
<p>Pursues in vain, and  from lone, awful glooms<br>
  Turns back to earth again with weary plumes.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>Through glacial gulfs  of Space the soul must roam<br>
  To feel the comfort of its earthly home.</p>
<p>Ah, Mother dear!  broad-bosomed Mother Earth!<br>
  Mother of all our Joy, Grief, Madness, Mirth!&mdash;</p>
<p>Mother of flower and  fruit, of stream and sea!&mdash;<br>
  We are thy children and must cling to thee.</p>
<p>I lay my head upon thy  breast and hear&mdash;<br>
  Small, small and faint, yet strangely sweet and clear&mdash;</p>
<p>The hum and clash of  little worlds below,<br>
  Each on its own path moving, swift or slow.</p>
<p>And listening, ever  with intenter ear,<br>
  Through din of wars invisible I hear</p>
<p>A Homer&mdash;genius is not  gauged by mass&mdash;<br>
  Singing his Iliad on a blade of grass.</p>
<p>And nations hearken:  his great song resounds<br>
  Unto the tussock&rsquo;s very utmost bounds.</p>
<p>States rise and fall,  each blade of grass upon,<br>
  But still his song from blade to blade rolls on</p>
<p>Through all the  tussock-world, and Helen still<br>
  Is Fairest Fair, and Ajax wild of will&mdash;</p>
<p>An Ajax whose huge  size, when measured o&rsquo;er,<br>
  Is full ten-thousandth of an inch or more&mdash;</p>
<p>Still hurls defiance at  the gods whose home<br>
  Is in the distant, awful, dew-drop dome</p>
<p>That trembling hangs,  suspended from a spray<br>
  An inch above him&mdash;worlds of space away.</p>
<p>Old prophecies  foretell&mdash;but Time proves all&mdash;<br>
  The day will come when it, like Troy,  shall fall.</p>
<p>Lo! through this small  great wondrous song there runs<br>
  The marching melody of stars and suns.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>I know these things,  yet cannot speak and tell<br>
  Their meanings. Over all is cast a spell.</p>
<p>Secrets they are,  sealed with a sevenfold seal;<br>
  My soul knows what my tongue may not reveal.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * *</p>
<p>I love the Night!  Bright Day the soul shuts in;<br>
  Night sends it soaring to its starry kin.</p>
<p>If I must leave at last  my place of birth&mdash;<br>
  This homely, gracious, green, familiar Earth,</p>
<p>With all it holds of  sorrow and delight&mdash;<br>
  I pray my parting-hour may be at night,</p>
<p>And that her curtain  dark may softly fall<br>
  On scenes I love, ere I depart from all.</p>
<p>Then shall I haply,  journeying through the Vast<br>
  Mysterious Silences, take one long, last</p>
<p>Fond look at Earth, and  watch from depths afar<br>
  The dear old planet dwindling to a star;</p>
<p>And sigh farewell unto  the friends of yore,<br>
  Whose kindly faces I shall see no more. </p>
