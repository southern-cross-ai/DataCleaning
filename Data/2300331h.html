  <h3 align="center"><b>Chapter I</b></h3>
  <p>In that delightful and exciting book, written by Captain Joshua Slocum,
    and entitled, &ldquo;Sailing Alone Round the World,&rdquo; there is a part
    wherein the adventurous American seaman relates how he protected himself
    from night attacks by the savages by a simple, but efficient precaution.
    It was his custom, when he anchored for the night off the snow-clad and inhospitable
    shores of Tierra del Fuego, to profusely sprinkle his cutter&rsquo;s deck
    with sharp tacks, and then calmly turn in and sleep the sleep of the just;
    for even the horny soles of the Fuegian foot is susceptible to the business
    end of a tack; and, as I read Slocum&rsquo;s story, I smiled, and thought
    of dear old Yorke and the <i>Francesco</i>.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>I first met Yorke early in the &ldquo;seventies.&rdquo;  Our vessel had
    run in under the lee of the South Cape of New Britain to wood and water,
    and effect some repairs, for in working northward through the Solomon Group,
    on a special mission to a certain island off the coast of New Guinea, we
    had met with heavy weather, and had lost our foretopmast. In those days there
    was not a single white man living on the whole of the south coast of New
    Britain, from St. George&rsquo;s Channel on the east, to Dampier&rsquo;s
    Straits on the west&mdash;a stretch of more than three hundred miles, and
    little was known of the natives beyond the fact of their being treacherous
    cannibals. In Blanche Bay only, on the northern shore, was there a settlement
    of a few adventurous English traders&mdash;the employees of a rich German
    company&mdash;and these were only acquainted with the natives in their own
    vicinity. Even the masters of trading vessels avoided the south coast of
    the great island, not only on account of the dangerous character of its inhabitants,
    but also because there was not, they thought, anything to tempt them to risk
    their and their crews&rsquo;  lives&mdash;for the shore nearly everywhere
    presented a line of dense unbroken forest, with but scanty groves of coco-palms
    at long intervals, and even had there been many such groves, no communication
    could be had with the people. In the wild days of the &ldquo;seventies&rdquo; the
    practice of cutting up and drying the coconut into what is known as &ldquo;copra&rdquo; had
    scarcely made any headway in those parts of New Britain, New Ireland, and
    the Solomon and New Hebrides Groups which were visited by trading vessels&mdash;the
    nuts were turned into oil by a crude and wasteful process known as &ldquo;rotting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The captain of our little vessel was one of the oldest and most experienced
    trading skippers in the Western Pacific, grim, resolute, and daring, but
    yet cautious of his men&rsquo;s lives, if not of his own; so when he decided
    to anchor under the lee of the South Cape, he chose a part of the coast which
    seemed to be but scantily inhabited. The dense forest which came down to
    the water&rsquo;s edge concealed from view any village that might have been
    near us; but the presence of smoke arising from various spots denoted that
    there were some natives living in the vicinity, though we could not see any
    canoes.</p>
  <p>We brought to about half a mile from the shore. Two boats were at once lowered,
    manned, and armed, and under the captain&rsquo;s guidance, set out to search
    for water, which we knew we should have but little difficulty in finding,
    even on the south coast of New Britain, which is not nearly so well watered
    as the northern shore of the island. In the captain&rsquo;s boat were six
    men besides himself; I was in charge of the covering boat, manned by six
    native seamen and carrying three water-casks&mdash;all we could stow.</p>
  <p>Pulling in together, close to the shore, the captain then went ahead, my
    boat following at the regulation distance of fifty yards, only four hands
    rowing in each, leaving four men to keep a look-out for natives.</p>
  <p>Presently the skipper turned to me, and pointed shoreward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place for us, Drake&mdash;between those two spurs&mdash;just
    round this point. There&rsquo;s bound to be water there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The place which he indicated was about two miles distant to the eastward,
    and the crews gave way with good will, for the prospect of having a drink
    of pure water after the brackish and ill-smelling stuff we had been drinking
    for a fortnight, was very pleasing. Although but a little past nine o&rsquo;clock
    in the morning the day was intensely hot, and windless as well, and the perspiration
    was streaming down the naked chests and backs of our sturdy native sailors.
    The only sounds that broke the silence were the cries of birds&mdash;cockatoos
    and large green and scarlet parrots, which screamed angrily at us as the
    boats passed close in to the dense, steamy jungle of the littoral.</p>
  <p>Just as the captain&rsquo;s boat rounded the point, we heard a cry of astonishment
    from his crew, a cry that was echoed by ourselves half a minute later; for
    there in the centre of a small landlocked bay, was a cutter lying at anchor!
    She appeared to be of about thirty or forty tons, had an awning spread aft,
    and presented a very weather-worn appearance; her rudder was gone, and the
    upper part of her stern badly damaged. There was no one visible on deck,
    but presently, in answer to the captain&rsquo;s hail, the face of an old,
    white-haired man, appeared above the companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on board,&rdquo; he called out in clear, vigorous tones, and
    we saw him take up a broom, which was lying on the skylight, and begin to
    sweep the after-deck vigorously with one hand, the other being in a sling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;s a lunatic,&rdquo; said Captain Guest, turning to
    me with a laugh. But we had no time to indulge in surmises, for in a few
    minutes we were drawing up alongside; the stranger was standing at the stern,
    broom in hand, watching us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Step on board here, over the stern, please,&rdquo;  he said, and
    then he added quickly, &ldquo;but are you all wearing boots?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the captain, now quite sure the old man was wrong
    in his head, &ldquo;some of my men have no boots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then they had better not come aboard,&rdquo; he said with a quiet,
    amused smile, as he saw our puzzled faces.</p>
  <p>The moment Captain Guest and myself stepped over the rail and shook hands
    with the stranger, we saw the reason for the broom&mdash;the entire deck,
    except the small space aft which had just been swept, was covered with broken
    glass!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, gentlemen. My name is Yorke, and this cutter is
    the <i>Francesco.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my name is Guest. I am master of the brigantine <i>Fray Sentos</i>,
    of Sydney, lying just round the point, and this is Mr. Drake, my supercargo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down here on the skylight, gentlemen, out of the way of the glass&mdash;my
    cabin is very small.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess it would have to be a pretty big one if you had another two
    men like yourself to share it,&rdquo; said Guest with a laugh, as he surveyed
    our new friend&rsquo;s proportions. And indeed he was right, for Yorke was
    over six feet in height, rather stout, and with a chest like a working bullock.
    His face and neck were deeply bronzed to a dark tan, and presented a striking
    and startling yet pleasing contrast to his snowy-white hair, moustache, and
    eyebrows; his clear, steely blue eyes were in consonance with the broad,
    square jaw, and the man&rsquo;s character revealed itself in his features&mdash;strong,
    courageous, dominant, and self-reliant.</p>
  <p>The moment Captain Guest mentioned that our men were thirsty and would like
    a drink of water, Yorke became the soul of hospitality, and told them to
    come on board and help themselves, while for Guest and myself he produced
    a couple of bottles of excellent Tennant, and took a glass of it himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, do you know, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said as he sat down on the
    cutter&rsquo;s rail, facing us, &ldquo;this morning I had a dream? I thought
    I heard some one call out, &lsquo;All ready there, for&rsquo;ard?&rsquo; and
    I heard the rattle of a cable through the hawse-pipes. Then I woke and looked
    at the clock&mdash;it was just half-past seven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And at half-past seven we let go anchor, a good four miles from here.
    Surely you could not have heard us at such a distance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s a fact. So, when I did hear you hail just now I
    knew my dream was verified. As a rule, dreams aren&rsquo;t worth a bag of
    shakings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are your crew, captain?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, now I&rsquo;ve a yarn to tell you. I&rsquo;m the only man on
    board&mdash;my mate and every man of my crew were massacred about six weeks
    ago off the north end of New Ireland, and I only escaped by the skin of my
    teeth. And now you can guess the meaning of all this glass on the deck. There&rsquo;s
    plenty of niggers all around us here, and that broken glass is a splendid
    protection for me at night time. Since I lost my men they have made two attempts
    to cut me off at night time, once at a place just the other side of Cape
    St. George and once near here. But,&rdquo;  and he laughed softly, &ldquo;they
    didn&rsquo;t stay on deck more than five seconds, I can assure you. I&rsquo;ll
    tell you the whole yarn presently. But say, captain&mdash;can you help me
    to a new rudder? I lost mine a week ago, and having a bad hand have not been
    able to do anything towards making one myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly I will. I&rsquo;ll send my carpenter to you as soon as
    we get back to the ship; or, better still, we&rsquo;ll tow you down to the
    Fray Bentos. But we are in want of water and firewood, and I should like
    to take some of both back with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He thanked Guest warmly, and added that, although the cutter had no rudder,
    she would steer very well with a sweep; and then he informed us there was
    good running water within a couple of cables&rsquo; length of the cutter,
    also plenty of wood, and offered to take us to the place. We need not, he
    said, apprehend any attack by the natives, as our party was too large, and
    the spot where we could fill the casks was in fairly open country, and by
    stationing a sentry or two on each side of the creek, we could both wood
    and water with safety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a village about six miles along the coast from here, and
    no doubt it was the people from there who boarded me the other night, for
    I saw a lot of canoes on a little beach there. I think it must be the largest
    village for many miles hereabout. Now, do you see all those columns of smoke?
    Some, you will notice, are very thin and bluish, while others are almost
    black; the thin ones are only from native ovens, the others are signals to
    the various smaller villages to the eastward&mdash;by this time every nigger
    within fifty miles of us knows that your ship is at anchor. I hope you left
    plenty of men on board?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plenty, and ours is a well-armed crew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just
    as he was stepping into the captain&rsquo;s boat, I asked him what was the
    matter with his hand. He replied carelessly that he had  &ldquo;managed to
    get a bit of a knock,&rdquo; and would be glad if I would look at it when
    we returned to the cutter, as it was rather painful at times.</p>
  <p>The boats were soon under way for the shore, and in a quarter of an hour
    we entered a narrow but deep creek, not wide enough to permit us using our
    oars; but this was of no consequence, for each boat carried half a dozen
    canoe paddles. Within a hundred yards up from the entrance we found the water
    to be quite fresh, and while some of the men started to fill the casks, the
    rest, except the sentries, made for a clump of about a dozen coconut-trees
    growing close beside a magnificent grove of areca-palms. Every nut that was
    young enough to drink was quickly thrown down, and carried to the boats.
    Then we set to work to collect firewood, and two or three dry, solid logs
    were dragged down into the creek, lashed together, and then, with them and
    the filled water casks in tow, we returned merrily to the <i>Franceses</i> hoisted
    up our water casks, swept up all the glass, shovelled it into a hogshead
    standing on the deck, hoisted her mainsail, and hove up her anchor, glad
    of having accomplished our task so easily and so quickly. A light air had
    sprung up, and the vessel, aided by the boats, made good progress towards
    our brigantine, despite the logs towing astern.</p>
  <p>Our new friend asked me if I would mind coming below with him, as it was
    past three o&rsquo;clock, and quite time we had something to eat and drink.</p>
  <p>The cabin certainly was small, but was spotlessly clean, and exceedingly
    well furnished. It contained three bunks, two of which were hidden from view
    by neat cretonne curtains.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was my poor young mate&rsquo;s bunk,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;and
    the other was the boatswain&rsquo;s. Now, will you please pass these up on
    deck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From a locker he took out a dozen or more of ale, two bottles of spirits,
    and a number of tins of beef, sardines, etc., together with an ample supply
    of biscuit. These I passed up to Guest, who, at Yorke&rsquo;s request, ordered
    the boats alongside, so that the crews could get some dinner, and a stiff
    glass of grog all round. Then we ourselves ate a most hearty meal, rendered
    the more enjoyable by the deliciously cool beer&mdash;a liquor which, until
    that day, we had not tasted for quite four or five months. As soon as we
    had finished, I asked him to let me examine his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you do a bit of cutting?&rdquo; he asked, as I began to remove
    the bandages.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; answered Guest for me, &ldquo;Drake loves to dig out
    a bullet, especially&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t he, Napoleon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Napoleon was one of our native crew&mdash;a short, nuggety little Tongan,
    who, in an attack made on our boats nearly a year before, had received a
    bullet in the calf of the leg. I had succeeded in extracting it without unduly
    mutilating the patient, for I had once acted as amateur assistant to a medical
    missionary in Samoa, and had seen a good many bullets extracted during a
    very lively six months&rsquo; native war.</p>
  <p>When I saw the condition of Yorke&rsquo;s hand, I was startled. It was enormously
    swollen from the tips of the fingers to the wrist, and badly lacerated and
    bruised all over the back, and presented a very dangerous appearance. The
    pain he had endured, and was enduring at the moment, must have been something
    atrocious, and I felt a sudden respect and admiration for a man who could
    attend to <i>our</i> wants before thinking of himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said Guest sympathisingly,  &ldquo;how did it
    happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He told us that ten days previously the cutter had struck on a reef in the
    night. She bumped heavily three or four times, but would have worked across
    the reef without serious damage, as there was a good breeze, had not a sea
    taken her on the bows, thrown her aback, and driven her stern first against
    the one exposed portion of the reef, tearing away her rudder, and smashing
    all the upper part of her stern. Yorke, who was half-stunned by the boom
    swinging over, and striking him on the head as he was rising to his feet
    after being hurled along the deck, felt that he had received an injury to
    his hand, which was bleeding profusely. But just then he gave no thought
    to it, for the next two or three seas fortunately carried the cutter over
    the reef into deep water and safety. When he came to examine his hand, he
    found it had been crushed, probably by a piece of the heavy hardwood rail,
    and several splinters were protruding from the back and wrist. These he had
    succeeded in extracting, but the pain continued to increase day by day, and
    the palm of the hand began to swell and gather.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps there&rsquo;s a bit of timber in there yet,&rdquo;  he remarked
    to us.</p>
  <p>I thought so also, and so did Guest, and after torturing the poor fellow
    a few minutes, I located the exact spot&mdash;just below the ball of the
    thumb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Yorke,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can cut it out, I am sure.
    But, frankly, the thumb is a dangerous thing for an amateur surgeon to meddle
    with, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he interrupted quietly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather
    run the risk of lockjaw than the certainty of blood poisoning, and I know
    that that is what it will turn to. Last night I made up my mind to cut into
    the damned thing this morning if that last poultice I put on had no effect.
    Now go ahead. There&rsquo;s a bottle of carbolic acid below, which will be
    useful, and my pocket-knife has a razor-edge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In less than five minutes I set to work, and in a few more, to my intense
    satisfaction&mdash;for I felt nervous&mdash;the thing was done, and I had
    extracted a piece of wood half an inch long, and as thick as a small quill.
    Then Guest and I carefully washed the wound over and over again in a solution
    of carbolic acid, and in half an hour the hand was bound up <i>pro tem</i>.
    Poor Yorke bore the pain without the twitching of an eyelid, and I felt a
    sincere thankfulness when, two hours later, we saw the change that relief
    from intense physical suffering had effected in his features.</p>
  <p>When we reached the brigantine, I was able to bandage the injured hand in
    a more shipshape and proper manner, as we had an ample supply of lint and
    other requirements; and within ten days he could use his hand freely, though
    it took a much longer time for a thorough recovery. That he was deeply grateful
    to us he showed us in many quiet ways; and before he had been with us a week,
    both the captain and myself, and, indeed, every one else on board the <i>Fray
    Bentos</i> had grown to like the man immensely, though at times he would
    become unaccountably moody and silent, and keep to himself, only speaking
    in answer to a direct question. But, even then, he never attempted to directly
    avoid us, and was always civil, even to any of our native crew who might
    speak to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess he thinks a lot about those poor men of his,&rdquo; said Guest
    to me one day.</p>
  <p>That first evening we had a very pleasant supper. Yorke was with us, and
    during the meal he gave us a detailed account of his voyage, and of the massacre
    of his little vessel&rsquo;s company.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>Chapter II</b></h3>
  <p>He had, he told us, bought the <i>Francesco</i> at Sourabaya about three
    years before, and after making several trading voyages between Manila and
    the Ladrone Islands&mdash;voyages which did not pay as well as he had anticipated&mdash;he
    fell in with the master of a Hobart Town whaler, who strongly advised him
    to go farther eastwards and southwards, particularly about the Admiralty
    Group and their vicinity, where a few colonial vessels were doing very well,
    trading for coconut oil, beche-de-mer, sandalwood, tortoise-shell and pearl-shell.
    Yorke took his advice and made a very successful voyage to the Admiralties,
    taking a cargo of pearl-shell to Singapore. This he sold very profitably,
    and was soon at sea again. On reaching the Admiralty Group, however, he was
    prevented from trading by the hostility of the natives, though on his previous
    visit they had been very friendly; and so, fearing that they might cut off
    the vessel, he decided to leave. He had with him a native of Yap, one of
    the Caroline Islands&mdash;a man who had wandered about the North and South
    Pacific from his boyhood. His name was Rul, and he was not only a good seaman
    and an expert diver, but spoke fluently nearly a score of Melanesian and
    Micronesian dialects.</p>
  <p>On the evening of the day that the cutter left Callie Harbour, on Admiralty
    Island, Yorke called his six men together, and told them that he was very
    undecided what to do. (I found out afterwards that he had a way of taking
    his crew into his confidence&mdash;&ldquo;It pleases them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
    has proved very useful on a number of occasions when their goodwill meant
    much to me  &ldquo;).</p>
  <p>After telling them that he did not like to risk their lives by trying to
    return to Callie Harbour, he asked if they were willing to sail with him
    to the southwestern coast of New Guinea, where, he had heard, there was a
    great deal of pearl-shell to be bought from the natives. At the same time
    he pointed out to them that it would be a risky undertaking; he had no chart
    of that part of the Western Pacific, and, if they lost the ship, they would
    stand but little chance of escaping from the cannibal natives.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;this fellow Rul said that although
    he and the other natives on board were quite willing to go anywhere with
    me, <i>he</i> knew of a place only two days&rsquo; sail away to the eastward
    where there was not only plenty of black-edge pearl-shell, but hawkbill turtle-shell
    as well. He had, he said, been cast away there in a whaleship, and remained
    on the island three months, could speak a little of the language, and gave
    me the names of several villages and harbours, but did not know the name
    of the island as a whole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I brought up my chart, and in a few seconds I discovered the names
    he had mentioned. The island was New Hanover, and, with the northerly breeze
    then blowing, I knew we should be there in twenty-four hours. So I made up
    my mind to try the place; for Rul was a thoroughly trustworthy fellow, and
    I knew I could depend on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My mate was a young American named Ted Merriman, a native of New
    London, Connecticut, a fine sailorman, and a good navigator. My boatswain,
    too, was one of the right sort; and, as for the rest, although they were
    all natives, they were good seamen, and I had never had a sulky look from
    any one of them since they first shipped with me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We anchored just off a village which Rul knew, and in a few minutes
    the people came off to us in crowds and filled the deck. Many of them recognised
    Rul, and they all showed great friendliness and eagerness to trade; and I,
    like a cocksure fool, was thrown off my guard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He ceased speaking, sighed, then lit his pipe and smoked in silence for
    awhile, and it was evident to us all that, although he was not an emotional
    man, he was strongly affected by the memory of the tragedy, and reproached
    himself keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything went well for the two following days,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;the
    natives had over ten tons of good black-edge shell, all of which I bought
    from them, paying for it principally in tobacco. It was worth to me in Singapore
    about &pound;65 a ton, and only cost me about &pound;3 a ton, so you may
    imagine that I felt very well satisfied. Then, besides the pearl-shell I
    bought nearly five hundredweight of splendid hawkbill turtle-shell, giving
    but two or three sticks of tobacco for an entire carapace of thirteen plates
    weighing between two and three pounds, and, as you know, hawkbill shell is
    worth eight dollars a pound in Hongkong, and much more in London or Hamburg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Yorke,&rdquo; said Guest, with a laugh,  &ldquo;you should
    not have told us this. Drake here is a very good fellow, but in business
    matters&mdash;as a supercargo&mdash;he&rsquo;d cut the throat of his best
    friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe that, Captain Yorke,&rdquo; I said,  &ldquo;but
    at the same time I wish you had not told us of this place. You certainly
    have the prior right of discovery, and ought to have the benefit, so I promise
    you I will not repeat to our owners anything you now tell us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yorke&rsquo;s face changed, and his bright blue eyes looked into ours with
    such a kindly expression that the fascination he already possessed over me
    deepened quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You and Captain Guest are welcome to my knowledge, but I trust you
    will use it for your own benefit, and not consider your owners. Tell me now,
    gentlemen, would they consider <i>you</i>? Would they give you a handsome
    bonus for putting, say, five, or six thousand pounds into their pockets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I daresay they would give us each a cheque for fifty pounds,&rdquo; said
    Guest meditatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then keep the thing dark,&rdquo; said the big man energetically, &ldquo;keep
    it dark. Why should you, Captain Guest, and you, Mr. Drake, enrich your owners
    by imparting to them this information? I tell you, gentlemen, that all shipowners
    are alike, at least I never ran across any that showed much consideration
    for any one else&rsquo;s welfare. Nine out of every ten will work the soul
    out of their ship-masters and officers, who, when they grow too old to go
    to sea, are chucked out into the gutter to die of poverty, unless they have
    laid by a nest-egg for their old age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is true enough,&rdquo; assented Guest, &ldquo;and our esteemed
    employers are no better than the general run. So we will look on what you
    have just told us as private; by and by we will all talk over the matter,
    and see if we cannot go into the thing together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yorke nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you. I&rsquo;ve always played a lone
    hand hitherto, but I think that I can pull very well with men like you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he resumed his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the morning of the third day I went ashore with my gun to have
    a few hours&rsquo; shooting on a large swamp, situated about three miles
    inland from the village. One of the natives had told Rul that there were
    great numbers of wild duck and plover there, and offered to guide me to the
    place; so, telling Merriman that I would be back in time for dinner, I started
    with the guide. The gun I had with me was a double-barrelled pin-fire Lefaucheux
    breech-loader, and just before I left the cutter, I put in a couple of cartridges,
    intending to have a shot at some cranes which I saw walking about on the
    beach. Most fortunately for me, they flew away before I could get near enough.
    Besides the gun, I brought with me a Sharp&rsquo;s rifle, as the guide said
    that we should most likely see a wild pig or two about the swamp. The rifle
    I gave to him to carry, but the ten cartridges for it I put in my coat pocket,
    together with about twenty cartridges for the gun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On landing at the village, I was met by the head man, who wanted
    to know if I would buy a couple of pigs from him. I told him to take them
    on board to the mate, who would pay him; then, the guide leading, we struck
    out into the forest. After going about a mile or so, the nigger was joined
    by half a dozen young bucks, all armed with spears and clubs. I asked the
    guide, who spoke a little English, what they wanted; he replied that they
    wished to see me shoot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;go ahead then, all of you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bucks grinned, but instead of going ahead stepped back to let
    me pass, and fell in, in single file at the rear, the guide still leading.
    Now, I didn&rsquo;t like that at all, and I turned round to tell them to
    go in front of me; I was just in time to save myself from getting a spear
    through my back&mdash;as it was, it whizzed through the side of my coat,
    and in another second the nigger who threw it had a charge of shot through
    his brains. Then, slewing round, I was just able to drop the guide, who was
    running off with the rifle. I hit him in the back, and saw him fall, then
    took cover behind a big tree to load again; but every other nigger had vanished,
    and then I heard a sound that filled me with dread for those on board the
    cutter&mdash;the loud, hoarse bellowing of conch shells.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ran over to the guide, who was lying where he had fallen. I don&rsquo;t
    think he was mortally wounded, for he was quite thirty yards off when I fired.
    However, I made certain of him by cracking his skull with a long-handled
    club he carried. Then I loaded the Sharp&rsquo;s rifle, slung it over my
    shoulder by its sling; and started back for the village at a run, holding
    my shot gun ready cocked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I reached the village, I could not see a soul&mdash;every house
    was deserted, but from the sea front I could hear diabolical yells and cries.
    I had to run another hundred yards or more before I came in sight of the
    cutter, and the moment I did so, I saw that it was all over with poor Merriman
    and the others&mdash;the vessel was simply swarming with niggers, and surrounded
    by canoes, into which they were already throwing the plunder!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I rested a minute or so to get my breath and steady my hand, and
    then opened fire. The cutter was not two hundred yards away from where I
    stood, and the very first shot plumped right into the black, surging crowd
    on deck, and one nigger gave his last jump. I fired three more shots into
    them before they had time to get into their canoes, or spring overboard to
    swim ashore. Most of the canoes made off to the south, around a point, but
    three or four of them came right in towards me, heading for the village.
    I don&rsquo;t think any of them saw me, for I was lying down among the roots
    and <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a fallen tree, just above high water mark. They
    came in, paddling like mad, but not uttering a sound. I waited till the first
    canoe was within ten yards of me, and then fired both barrels of my gun in
    quick succession right into them, nearly blowing the chest out of the old
    chief, who was seated amidships, and wounding all the others. Then I got
    to work with my rifle again on the other canoes; and, although the moment
    they saw me, the niggers jumped overboard and dived, I got one for every
    shot of the last six cartridges&mdash;whenever one got into shallow water
    and stood up to run, down he went.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, taking both shot gun and rifle by the barrels, I smashed them
    on a rock, tore off my clothes and boots, and started to swim off to the
    vessel, looking behind me every now and then to see if the niggers were following.
    But they had had enough of me, and their empty canoes were drifting about
    the bay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got alongside, clambered up over the waist, and saw a sight I shall
    never forget&mdash;every one of my poor shipmates had been ruthlessly slaughtered,
    and their mutilated bodies, stripped of every bit of clothing, were lying
    about the deck. A very brief examination showed me that every one of them
    was dead&mdash;in fact their heads had been beaten to pulp, and each body
    was pierced through and through with spear wounds and hacked and chopped
    about with tomahawks; while the deck was just a puddle of blood, mixed with
    sticks of tobacco, pieces of print, knives, and all sorts of trade goods.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first thing I did was to try and hoist the mainsail so as to
    get under way, but the black devils had cut away a lot of the running gear,
    and the halliards had been severed and lay on the deck, ready to be taken
    on shore with the other loot littered about, though the sail itself had not
    been damaged. The jib and staysail, also, I could not hoist: they were lying
    in a heap on the windlass with a dead nigger on top, and, further aft, were
    another two of the gentry, one dead and one with a smashed thigh bone. I
    slung the wounded man overboard to the sharks, and then began to consider
    what was best to do. The niggers, I felt certain, would not tackle the cutter
    again, when they knew I was safe on board, but I determined to make certain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You noticed those two brass three-pounders I carry? Well, the first
    thing I did was to load them with heavy charges of round bullets, and some
    nuts and bolts. Then I got up a dozen or so of rifles, and plenty of ammunition,
    and laid them in readiness on the skylight; for, although the niggers had
    turned my cabin upside down when looting the ship, there were any amount
    of small arms and various stores in the little hatch under the cabin table;
    besides these, I had some more in my own berth in a locker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as I was taking a long drink at the scuttle butt, I saw some
    of the niggers creeping back to the village through the trees, and watching
    what I was doing. I soon let them know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cutter had swung round, and was broadside on to the houses, so
    taking the gun on the port side over to the starboard, I secured it well,
    and then trained it with the other on the biggest house in the village&mdash;a
    sort of meeting-house or temple, or some such darned thing. I can tell you,
    gentlemen, I felt as if I could laugh when I saw quite a score of the black
    swine go into this house, one after another. I had friction tubes in both
    guns, and waited for another five minutes; then I fired them one after another.
    Whether many or any niggers were killed, I do not know; but there was a fearful
    howling, which did me good to hear, and the front of the house went into
    splinters under the heavy charges of the guns, and in five seconds the village
    was deserted again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before I did anything more for my own safety, I got some sailcloth
    and rugs, and covered the bodies of my shipmates&mdash;the dreadful appearance
    they presented just unnerved me, and I felt like sitting down and crying.
    But I had to hustle. I wanted to get under way as quickly as possible before
    darkness came on, and it was now noon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First of all I rove the mainsail halliards, and then bent on the
    jib, stopping only now and then to fire a rifle at the village, just to let
    the natives know I was keeping my eyes skinned. Then I hoisted the mainsail
    and hove up my anchor without any trouble, for the wind was very light, and
    got a good cant off shore as soon as I ran up the jib.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As soon as I was well away from the land, I stood north&mdash;about
    so as so clear Cape Queen Charlotte, the westerly point of New Hanover, and
    ran on for three or four hours, the vessel steering herself while I sewed
    up poor Merriman&rsquo;s and the boatswain&rsquo;s bodies as well as I could
    under the circumstances. I should have done the same for the natives had
    I had the time, especially for Rul, but I had not. About dusk I brought to,
    just off the Cape, and dropped them over the side one after another&mdash;only
    just realising, ten minutes previously, that I was still stark naked!</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>&ldquo;After rounding the north point of New Hanover, I stood away down
    the coast of New Ireland till I made Gerrit Denys Island, where I anchored
    for a couple of days, the natives being very friendly, and giving me all
    the fresh provisions I wanted for a little tobacco and some hoop-iron. There
    was an old white beachcomber named Billy living with them; he seemed to do
    pretty well as he liked, and had a deal of influence with them, not allowing
    any one of them to hang about the vessel after sunset, and each night he
    slept on board with me. I gave him a case of Hollands for lending me a hand
    to set up my rigging, which so pleased him that he turned to and got drunk
    in ten minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After leaving Gerrit Denys I had a hard struggle to make Cape St.
    George, on the south end of New Ireland. For eight or ten days I had rainy
    weather, with heavy squalls from the eastward, and did not feel very well
    into the bargain, for I had a touch of fever and ague.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I asked him how he managed at night-time as regarded sleep.</p>
  <p>He laughed quietly, and assured us that he never lost a night&rsquo;s rest
    during the whole of the time he was at sea. He would simply  &ldquo;scandalise&rdquo; his
    mainsail without reefing it, haul the staysail sheet to windward, and let
    the cutter head reach till daylight. The <i>Francesco</i> he said&mdash;and
    I afterwards found out that he was not over-rating her qualities&mdash;was
    a marvellous little vessel for taking care of herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I jogged along till one Sunday morning, when I made the land
    between Cape Bougainville and Cape St. George. It had been raining in torrents
    for two days, and I was feeling a bit done up; so, picking out a quiet little
    bay with thick forest growing right down to the water&rsquo;s edge, and not
    a sign of a native or native house, I ran in and let go in fifteen fathoms,
    but within a stone throw of the shore. And I&rsquo;ll be hanged, gentlemen,
    if I did not see, ten minutes afterwards, the smoke of half a dozen signal
    fires rising over the trees from as many different places, and all within
    three miles of the cutter. However, I was too weak to heave up again, even
    had I felt inclined. I wanted to cosset myself up, and get a good sweating
    between thick blankets to drive some of the fever out of me; and, niggers
    or no niggers, I meant to do so that day. Then I thought of a dodge&mdash;I
    mean the broken-glass trick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the hold were half a dozen barrels of empty gin, beer, and whisky
    bottles. We had put them aside to give to the Admiralty Island people&mdash;especially
    the women and children&mdash;who attached some value to them as water holders.
    I brought up sixty or seventy dozen, and smashed them up in a clean hogshead.
    Then I turned the whole lot out in a heap on the main hatch, got a shovel,
    and covered the entire deck fore and aft, first getting all loose ropes, &amp;c,
    out of the way, as I did not want to get any glass in my own hands when I
    next handled the running gear. After that I went below, lit a spirit lamp,
    and made myself a big bowl of hot soup&mdash;real hot soup&mdash;a small
    tin of soup and bouilli, and a half bottle of Worcester sauce with a spoonful
    of cayenne pepper and a stiff glass of brandy thrown in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It touched me up, I can tell you, but I knew it would do me good
    as I lay down in my bunk, rolled myself in a heavy blanket, and piled over
    me every other rug and blanket I could find. In half an hour I was sweating
    profusely, for not only was the soup remedy working, but the little cabin,
    having every opening closed, was stiflingly hot. However, I stuck it out
    for a good two hours, till I felt I could stand it no longer; so I got up,
    unfastened my cabin door to get some air, and began rubbing myself down with
    a coarse towel. Heavens! it felt delightful; for although my bones still
    ached, and I was very shaky on my legs, my head was better, and my spirits
    began to rise. I put on my pyjamas, went on deck, and had a look round. It
    was nearly dark, the rain had cleared off, a young moon was just lifting
    over the trees, and the little bay was as quiet as the grave&mdash;except
    for the cries of a colony of flying foxes which lived in a big <i>vi</i> tree
    just a cable&rsquo;s length away from the cutter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew that the New Britain and New Ireland natives don&rsquo;t like
    going out after dark, and that if these people meant mischief to me, they
    would wait till just before daylight, when they would expect to find everyone
    on board asleep; so, feeling much better and stronger, I turned in at eight
    o&rsquo;clock, and slept till past midnight. I made some coffee, drank it,
    and laid down again, dozing off every now and then till just before dawn.
    Then I heard a sudden rush on deck, followed by the most diabolical howls
    and yells as twenty or thirty niggers jumped overboard with bleeding feet,
    many of them leaving their clubs lying on the deck. I put my head out of
    the cabin, and gave them half a dozen revolver shots, but I&rsquo;m afraid
    I didn&rsquo;t hit any of the beggars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got away on the same morning, and made a fine run right across
    St. George&rsquo;s Channel, and along the New Britain coast till I made Cape
    Roebuck. Once the cutter did a steady nine knots for thirty hours. After
    running on that reef, I did not drop anchor again till I brought up off a
    rocky beach a few miles from here; and there the niggers made another try
    to get me, but the broken glass again proved effectual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty smart dodge, Captain Yorke,&rdquo;  said Guest,
    as we rose and shook hands with him, for he was going to sleep on board his
    own vessel.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>Chapter III</b></h3>
  <p>We lay under the lee of the South Cape or New Britain for nearly a fortnight,
    during which time we effected all the necessary repairs to our own vessel,
    and fitted Yorke&rsquo;s cutter with a new rudder. So far he had not told
    us anything further of his intentions as regarded either the further prosecution
    of his trading voyage, or its abandonment. At breakfast one morning, Guest
    told him that he (Yorke) could have a couple of our native hands to help
    him work the cutter to Manila, or any other port in the China Seas, if he
    so desired.</p>
  <p>He stroked his big, square jaw meditatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is very kind of you, Captain Guest,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;but
    to tell you the exact truth, I don&rsquo;t know my own mind at this moment.
    I&rsquo;ve a hazy sort of an idea that I&rsquo;d like to keep the Fray Bentos
    company for a bit longer. I can outsail you in light winds&mdash;and I really
    don&rsquo;t care what I do now. And if you can spare me a couple of hands,
    I could jog along in company with you indefinitely. But, please understand
    me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to thrust myself and the <i>Francesco</i> into
    your company if <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t want<i> me</i>. As a matter of fact,
    I don&rsquo;t care a straw where I go&mdash;but I certainly would like to
    keep in company with you, if you don&rsquo;t object. Perhaps you would not
    mind telling me where you are bound?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guest looked at me interrogatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Captain Yorke,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;one confidence begets
    another; your confidence in us is worth a heap of money to Guest and myself,
    and, to be perfectly frank and straightforward with you, the captain and
    myself intended to lay a proposition before you whereby we three might possibly
    go into this New Hanover venture on our own hook. But Guest and myself are
    bound to our present employers for another seven months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yorke nodded. &ldquo;That will be all right. I&rsquo;m ready to go in with
    you, either at the end of seven months or at any other time which may suit
    you. You can count on me. I&rsquo;m not a rich man, nor yet am I a poor man;
    in fact, there&rsquo;s a thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of stuff under the <i>Francesco&rsquo;s</i> hatches
    now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, Captain Yorke,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as Guest here leaves
    me to do all the talking, I&rsquo;ll tell you <i>why</i> we are so far up
    to the northward, out of our usual beat. We heard in Samoa that a big ship,
    named the <i>Sarawak</i> had run ashore and been abandoned at Rook Island,
    in Dampier Straits, between the west end of New Britain and the east coast
    of New Guinea, and both Guest and myself know her to be one of the largest
    ships out of Liverpool; she left Sydney for Hongkong about six months ago
    with a general cargo. And &lsquo;there be pickings,&rsquo; for she is almost
    a new vessel, and her gear and fittings alone, independent of her cargo,
    ought to be worth a thousand pounds. All we could learn at Samoa was that
    she had run up on a ledge of reef on Rook Island, and that the skipper, with
    three boats&rsquo; crews, had started off for Thursday Island, in Torres
    Straits. Now, it is quite likely that, if she has not broken up, there may
    be a lot of money hanging to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For your owners!&rdquo; said Yorke, with his slow, amused smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just so, Captain Yorke. &lsquo;For our owners,&rsquo;  as you say.
    But even our owners, who are rather &lsquo;sharp&rsquo; people, are not a
    bad lot&mdash;they&rsquo;ll give Guest and myself a bonus of some sort if
    we do them good over this wrecked ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t &lsquo;do them good&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked,
    with the same half-humorous, half-sarcastic smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, the senior partner in our highly-esteemed, sailor-sweating
    firm, will tell Guest and myself that we &lsquo;made a most reprehensible
    mistake,&rsquo; and have put the firm to a considerable loss by doing too
    much on our own responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nodded as I went on&mdash;&ldquo;We heard of this wreck from the officers
    of a French cruiser which called at Samoa while we were there. They sighted
    her lying high and dry on the reef, sent a boat ashore, and found her abandoned.
    She was bilged, but not badly, as far as they could see. On the cabin table
    was nailed a letter, written by the captain, saying that being unable to
    float the ship again, and fearing that he and his unarmed crew would be attacked
    by the savages, he was starting off in his boats for Thursday Island, the
    nearest port. Now, that is a big undertaking, and the chances are that the
    poor fellows never reached there. However, Guest and I thought so much of
    the matter that we hustled through our business in Samoa, and sailed the
    next day direct for Rook Island, instead of doing our usual cruise to the
    eastward. But we met with fearful weather coming up through the Solomon Group,
    lost our foretopmast, and strained badly. And here we are now, tied up by
    the nose off the South Cape of New Britain instead of being at Rook Island
    at work on that wreck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yorke thought a moment. &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, let me come in with you&mdash;just
    for the fun of the thing. I don&rsquo;t want to get any money out of it,
    I assure you, and I&rsquo;ll lend you a hand with the wrecking work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Guest, extending his hand, &ldquo;but only on
    this condition&mdash;whatever our owners give Drake and myself, we three
    divide equally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you please, as you please,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now come aboard
    my little hooker, and have a look at what is in the hold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went on board the Francesco with him, and made an examination of her
    small but valuable cargo, and Guest and I agreed that he had underestimated
    its worth by quite four hundred or five hundred pounds&mdash;in fact, the
    whole cargo would sell in Sydney or San Francisco for about sixteen hundred
    pounds.</p>
  <p>We sailed together that afternoon, the cutter getting under weigh first.
    We had given Yorke three of our men&mdash;Napoleon the Tongan, and two other
    natives&mdash;and before ten minutes had passed, Guest and everyone else
    on board the <i>Fray Bentos</i> could see that the <i>Francesco</i> could
    sail rings round our old brigantine, even in a stiff breeze, for the cutter
    drew as much water as we did, and had a big spread of canvas. By nightfall
    we were running before a lusty south-east breeze, the cutter keeping about
    half a mile to windward of us, and taking in her gaff topsail, when it became
    dark, otherwise she would have run ahead of, and lost us before morning.
    At daylight, when I went on deck, she was within a cable&rsquo;s length,
    Yorke was steering&mdash;smoking as usual&mdash;and no one else was visible
    on deck.</p>
  <p>I hailed him: &ldquo;Good morning, Captain; where are your men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taking
    it out in &lsquo;bunk, oh,&rsquo;&rdquo; he answered with a laugh. &ldquo;I
    came on deck about two hours ago, and told them to turn in until four bells.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll ruin them for the <i>Fray Bentos</i>, sir,&rdquo; cried
    our mate with grumbling good-humour. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you start one
    of &rsquo;em at the galley fire for your coffee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m coming aboard you for it,&rdquo; was the reply.
    He hauled in the main-sheet, lashed the tiller, went quietly forward without
    awakening his native seamen, and put the staysail to windward. Then he came
    amidships again to the main hatch, picked up the little dingy which was lying
    there, and, despite his bad hand, slid her over the cutter&rsquo;s rail into
    the water as if she were a toy, got in, and sculled over to the brigantine,
    leaving the cutter to take care of herself!</p>
  <p>Charley King, the mate of the <i>Fray Bentos</i> turned to me in astonishment.
    He was himself one of the finest built and most powerful men I had ever met,
    not thirty years of age, and had achieved a great reputation as a long-distance
    swimmer and good all-round athlete.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Drake, that dingy must weigh three hundred pounds, if she
    weighs an ounce, for she&rsquo;s heavy oak built! And yet with one gammy
    hand he can put her over the side as if she was made of brown paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yorke sculled alongside, made fast to the main chains, clambered over the
    bulwarks, and stepped aboard in his usual quiet way, as if nothing out of
    the common had occurred, and asked the mate what he thought of the <i>Francesca</i> as
    a sailer. King looked at him admiringly for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a daisy, Captain Yorke&hellip; but you oughtn&rsquo;t to
    have put your boat over the side by yourself, sir, with that bad hand of
    yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The big man laughed so genuinely, and with such an infectious ring in his
    voice, that even our Kanaka steward, who was bringing us our coffee, laughed
    too. The dingy, he said, was very light, and there was no need for him to
    call one of the men to help him. As we drank our coffee he chatted very freely
    with us, and drew our attention to the lovely effect caused by the rising
    sun upon a cluster of three or four small thickly-wooded islets, which lay
    between the two vessels and the mainland of New Britain, whereupon King,
    who had no romance in his composition, remarked that for his part he could
    not see much difference between one sunrise or sunset and another. &ldquo;One
    means a lot of wind, and another none at all; one means decent weather and
    another means rotten weather, or middlin&rsquo;  weather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. King, you look at everything from a sailor&rsquo;s point
    of view,&rdquo; he said good-naturedly. &ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s nothing
    gives me more pleasure than to watch a sunset and sunrise anywhere in the
    tropics&mdash;particularly if there&rsquo;s land in the foreground or background&mdash;I
    never miss a sunrise in the South Seas if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently we began to talk of the voyage, and I asked him a question&mdash;which
    only at that moment occurred to me&mdash;concerning himself before we met.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder, Captain Yorke, when your crew were cut off, that it did
    not occur to you to run down the west coast of New Ireland, between it and
    New Britain, to Blanche Bay, where there is a German station, and where you
    could have obtained assistance. It would have been much easier for you instead
    of that long buffeting about on the east coast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made no answer at first, and I saw that his face had changed colour.
    Then he answered slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just so. I knew all about the Germans at Blanche Bay, but I did not
    want to go there&mdash;for very good reasons. Will you come aboard and have
    some breakfast with me? I&rsquo;ll send you back again any time you like;
    the sea is so smooth, as far as that goes, that I could run the cutter alongside,
    and let you step off on to your own deck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just as we were pushing off from the brigantine, Guest came on deck, glass
    in hand, to have a look at the cluster of islands, at the same time calling
    out to Yorke and myself to wait a little. After scanning the islands from
    the deck, he went aloft for a better view, then descended and came aft again
    to the rail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Captain Yorke. I&rsquo;ve just been taking a look at
    those islands over there, and an idea has just come to me. But, first of
    all, are they marked on your chart? They are on mine, but not even named&mdash;just
    dots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither are they on my big sheet chart&mdash;and I have no other
    of this part of the Western Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, here&rsquo;s my idea. I see from aloft that there is a
    good-sized blue water lagoon there, and as likely as not there may be pearl-shell
    in it. Anyway, it&rsquo;s worth seeing into, and so if Drake and yourself
    like to take our boat and half a dozen men, you might have a look in there.
    I can&rsquo;t see any houses, but at the same time, be careful. You can run
    in with the cutter pretty close, and then go ashore in the boat. You are
    bound to find a passage into the lagoon somewhere or other. I&rsquo;ll send
    Tim Rotumah and George&rdquo; (two of our native crew who were good divers) &ldquo;with
    you in the boat; they&rsquo;ll soon let you know if there is any shell in
    the lagoon. If there is, light a fire, and make a smoke, and I&rsquo;ll anchor
    the brigantine and come after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was delighted with this, and at once returned on board, while Yorke went
    off to the cutter to give his crew their instructions. In ten or fifteen
    minutes the whaleboat was over the side awaiting me, manned by six of our
    native crew, all of whom were armed with Snider carbines and revolvers. Pushing
    off from the <i>Fray Bentos</i>, we went alongside the <i>Francesco</i> to
    pick up Yorke, who was waiting for the boat. As the wind had now fallen very
    light, he suggested to me to make a start at once, leaving the cutter in
    charge of Napoleon, with orders to anchor if it fell calm, and he was on
    easy soundings.</p>
  <p>The morning was deliciously bright, clear, and, for those latitudes at that
    season of the year, very cool. As the boat skimmed over the placid surface
    of the ocean, &ldquo;schools&rdquo; of bright silvery gar-fish and countless
    thousands of small flying squid sprang into the air and fell with a simultaneous
    splash into the water on each side and ahead of us. Then &ldquo;George,&rdquo; a
    merry-faced, broad-chested native of Anaa, in the Paumotu Islands, after
    an inquiring glance at me, broke out into a bastard Samoan-Tokelauan canoe
    song, with a swinging chorus, altering and improvising as he sang, showing
    his white teeth, as every now and then he smiled at Yorke and myself when
    making some humorous play upon the words of the original song, praising the
    former for his skill and bravery, and his killing of the man-eating savages
    of New Hanover, his great strength and stature, and his kindly heart&mdash;&ldquo;a
    heart which groweth from his loins upwards to his throat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long, long years have passed since that day, but I shall always remember
    how Yorke turned to me with a smile when at something George had sung, the
    rest of our crew burst into approving laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is he saying about me?&mdash;of course I can recognise that &lsquo;Ioka&rsquo; means &lsquo;Yorke,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely personal, but highly complimentary to you. Now,
    wait a bit, till they come to the chorus, and I&rsquo;ll try and translate
    it. There, he&rsquo;s starting:&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Miti Ioka, malie toa, toa malohi<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H&#257;lo! Tama, H&#257;lo Foe!!!&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which goes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as far as I can understand, something
    like this&mdash;&rsquo;Mr. Yorke, warrior brave and fighter strong, Captain
    Yorke, the sailor captain, leader Yorke who fired so truly, slew the black,
    man-eating pigs of savages! Oh, the pity he is single, oh, the pity he is
    single! <i>Pull, men, pull!</i> The next verse says that did the world of
    women know that such a fine man as yourself was a bachelor, they would consume
    themselves with grief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder why they should take it for granted that I am a single man,&rdquo; he
    laughed, as he began to fill his pipe; then he added quietly&mdash;&ldquo;I
    may be a widower for all I know. I was married in Copenhagen thirty years
    ago, and have never seen my wife since, and trust I never may.&rdquo; Then
    in a moment he changed the subject, and I took good care not to mention the
    matter again.</p>
  <p>An hour after leaving the brigantine, we found a passage&mdash;narrow but
    safe&mdash;leading into the lagoon, which was a mile or mile and a half in
    width, and but for the one opening in the reef, completely land locked by
    four small islands, all low and densely wooded with banyan and other trees,
    and connected with each other at low tide. Here and there, at intervals,
    were groves of coco-palms, and a few <i>vi</i> trees&mdash;the wild mango
    of the Western Pacific, growing close down to the beach, which on the inner
    side of the lagoon was of bright yellow sand, and presented a very pleasing
    appearance.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>Chapter IV</b></h3>
  <p>A very brief trial of the lagoon, at various depths, soon convinced us that
    it contained no pearl-shell, both George and the Rotumah man coming up empty-handed
    after each dive, and pronouncing the bottom to be <i>og&eacute;</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
    poverty-stricken as regarded shell. But we made one rather pleasing discovery,
    which was that the lagoon contained a vast number of green turtle. We could
    see the creatures, some of them being of great size, swimming about beneath
    the boat in all directions. It at once occurred to me that I should let Guest
    know, for we were getting short of provisions on board the <i>Fray Bentos</i>,
    and had been using native food&mdash;pork, yams, and taro, to eke out our
    scanty store. Here, now, was an opportunity of getting a supply of fresh
    meat which would last us for a couple of months or more; as we could easily
    stow eighty or a hundred turtle on board, and kill one or two every day as
    required. We always carried with us a heavy turtle-net, made of coir fibre,
    which I had bought two years before in the Tokelau Group. But, first of all,
    I consulted with our native crew as to whether we could dispense with the
    net by remaining on the island all night and watching for the turtle to come
    ashore.</p>
  <p>They all assured me that we should get none, or at best but few, as it was
    not the laying season.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;go off to the ship, and tell the
    captain that there is no pearl-shell here, but plenty of turtle. Ask him
    if he will let you have the turtle-net, so that we can set it across the
    mouth of the passage as soon as it becomes dark; and tell him we shall come
    off again by midnight if he does not care about our staying till the morning;
    but that as we are pretty sure to get a lot of turtle, he had better send
    the longboat as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yorke, at first, intended to go off again to the <i>Francesca</i>, but I
    told him I was so sure that Guest would come to an anchor when he heard about
    the turtle, that he (Guest) would be sure to tell Napoleon and the other
    men on board the cutter to do the same. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;a
    supply of turtle will be a God-send to us, and the skipper will not mind,
    I am sure, if we stay here for a couple of days, under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We pulled ashore to a little sandy beach, and Yorke and myself, taking our
    rifles, ammunition, and a few biscuits each, got out, the native crew at
    once starting off again for the ship, pulling as hard as they could, for
    they were eager to return with the turtle-net and enjoy themselves as only
    South Sea Islanders and other of Nature&rsquo;s children do when fishing.</p>
  <p>About an hour after the boat had gone, we set to work to get some coconuts
    to drink, both for ourselves and the boat&rsquo;s crew when they returned.
    Yorke ascended a very tall palm&mdash;about sixty feet in height&mdash;like
    a native, and began throwing down the young nuts. I took a shorter tree near
    by, and was leisurely twisting off the heavy nuts, when he, who had a good
    view of the sea, called out to me that it had fallen calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what I don&rsquo;t like, Drake, is this,&rdquo; he added&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    a dull, greasy look on the water over to the eastward there, and I&rsquo;d
    like to be on board the Francesca instead of being here. I don&rsquo;t like
    it, I can tell you, and I&rsquo;m sorry we did not go off in the boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I, in my fatuous, youthful conceit, laughed at his forebodings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a New Britain squall&mdash;a lot of wind for ten
    minutes, then a power of rain for another twenty, and then it&rsquo;ll be
    over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yorke, however, was too old and experienced a seaman to disregard the signs
    of coming danger. He quickly descended from his tree, and I followed suit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something more than a squall coming, my lad. Let us
    cut through the bush across to the weather side of the island, and try and
    stop the boat. We can do it if we are quick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The island was less than a mile in width, even at its broadest portion,
    which was where we had landed; so, after a hurried drink, we picked up our
    rifles and started off to try to intercept the boat as she was pulling down
    the outer and eastern shore. But before we had made two hundred yards, we
    came to a dead stop, our progress being barred by a dense thicket of thorny
    and stunted undergrowth. We turned aside and skirted the thicket for a quarter
    of a mile, then tried again, with the same result&mdash;it was absolutely
    impossible to force our way through the obstacle.</p>
  <p>By this time the air had become stiflingly hot and oppressive, and the rapidly
    darkening sky presaged the coming storm. From every pore in our bodies the
    perspiration was streaming profusely, and our hands and faces were scratched
    and bleeding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must go back,&rdquo; said Yorke, &ldquo;we cannot possibly get
    to the other side of the island through this damnable scrub. The only thing
    we can do is to run along the inner beach of the island till we come to its
    end, wade across the reef, and try to stop the boat before she has gone too
    far. This is no common squall, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to
    be a hurricane. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We started off at a run, along the hard sand, but before we had done the
    first quarter of a mile, I felt that I could go no further, for I was pumped
    out, could scarcely breathe, and felt a strange, unnatural faintness overcoming
    me&mdash;a not uncommon sensation experienced by many people just before
    a hurricane or an earthquake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must go on alone,&rdquo; I said, pantingly, to Yorke; &ldquo;leave
    me here. I&rsquo;ll be all right, even if I have to stop here a month of
    Sundays. I can&rsquo;t starve in such a place as this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pitching his own and my rifle up on the bank above high water mark, he seized
    me and lifted me up on his back, telling me to hold on, as he meant to make
    a big try for the boat. It was no use my protesting&mdash;he set off again
    at a steady run, my weight apparently impeding his progress no more than
    if he had been carrying a doll instead of ten stone.</p>
  <p>At last we gained the end of the island, where there was a break in the
    verdure, and from which we had a brief view of the sea before it was blotted
    out by the black wall of the coming hurricane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done as far as getting on board is concerned,&rdquo;  he
    said, as I slid down his back on to the sand; &ldquo;but, thank God, the
    boat is safe. In another ten minutes she would have been too late to have
    reached either the cutter or brigantine, and have been smothered. Look, Captain
    Guest is all ready, and so is the cutter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I got up on my feet, just in time to see the boat go alongside the brigantine,
    which was under a close reefed lower topsail and a bit of her mainsail only&mdash;for
    Guest knew what was coming, and had prepared to meet it; the cutter, too,
    was reefed down, and had taken her dingy on deck. At that moment, however,
    both vessels were becalmed; but scarcely had the whale boat been hoisted
    up to the starboard davits of the <i>Fray Bentos</i> and secured, when the
    hurricane struck both vessels. I thought at first that our poor old brigantine
    was going to turn turtle, for she was all but thrown on her beam ends; but
    righting herself gallantly, she plunged away into the growing darkness, followed
    by the cutter, and in five minutes both were hidden from view, and Yorke
    and myself had to throw ourselves flat on our faces to avoid being blown
    down the beach into the lagoon.</p>
  <p>I had once, years before when a boy in Fiji, seen a bad hurricane, and was
    rather proud of my experience, but I never saw, and never wish to see again,
    such a truly terrifying and appalling sight as my companion and I now witnessed&mdash;for
    within an hour all Nature seemed to have gone stark, raving mad, and I never
    expected to see the next morning&rsquo;s sun. I do not think it was the fearful
    force of the wind which so terrified me into a state of helplessness as the
    diabolical clamour&mdash;the clashing and tearing and rending asunder of
    the trees, accompanied by a prolonged howling mingled with a deep droning
    hum like one sometimes hears when a volcano is in eruption&mdash;and, in
    a minor key, the dulled roaring of the surf as the mighty seas swept over
    the outer reef, and broke over the weather shore with such tremendous force
    that the island seemed to tremble to its very foundations.</p>
  <p>Unable to make himself heard in the pandemonium roaring around us, Yorke
    turned to me, and gripping me by one hand, and shielding his eyes with the
    other from the hurtling showers of sand and pebbles which threatened to cut
    our faces to pieces, he managed to drag me along the beach to a low ledge
    of coral rocks, under the shelter of which we were protected from the fury
    of the wind, and, in a measure, safe from flying branches, though all along
    the beach coco-palms were being torn up by the roots, or their lofty crowns
    cut off as if they were no stronger than a dahlia or some such weakly plant.</p>
  <p>As we crouched on the sand under the ledge of rock, a terrific but welcome
    downpour of rain fell, and we were able to satisfy our thirst by pressing
    our mouths to crevices in the rock overhead. But we were not long allowed
    to remain undisturbed in our shelter, for, although the tide was on the ebb,
    the enormous influx of water, driven over the reef by the violence of the
    wind, so swelled the lagoon that we had to abandon our refuge and crawl on
    our hands and knees up over the bank, and thence into the thorny scrub, where
    we were at least safe from falling trees, there being none near us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must try and get our rifles before it is too late,&rdquo; shouted
    Yorke in my ear. &ldquo;I know the place, but if I don&rsquo;t get there
    pretty quick, I shall never be able to recognise it. Stay where you are until
    I get back, then we&rsquo;ll try and find a better camping place before night
    comes on&mdash;if this little tin-pot island isn&rsquo;t blown out of the
    water over on to New Guinea in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By this time I was beginning to get some courage, and to feel ashamed of
    myself; so, as soon as Yorke had crept out of the scrub, I braced myself
    up, and taking out my sheath knife, began to cut away the thorny branches,
    and pull up by the roots some of the scrub around me, so as to make more
    room. The soil consisted of decomposed shell and vegetable matter, very soft
    and porous, underneath which were loose coral slabs, and I soon had a space
    cleared large enough for us both to lie down upon. Then I started to enclose
    it on three sides by a low wall of the flat coral stones, across which I
    laid a thick and nearly rain-proof covering of branches and leaves, and when
    Yorke returned an hour later, I was almost finished, and had begun to make
    a fire of dead roots and branches.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s grand,&rdquo; he said, as he laid down the rifles. &ldquo;I
    was wondering if your matches were dry. Mine are spoilt, as I had them loose
    in my pocket. How is your tobacco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite dry, too. Here you are, fill your pipe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s thoughtfulness showed at once. &ldquo;No, thank you&mdash;not
    just yet. I&rsquo;ll improve this newly-erected mansion of ours by getting
    coconut branches up from the beach. We might as well make our roof as watertight
    as we can before dark. Then I want something to eat, and there are plenty
    of coconuts lying about everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t starve,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;there are any amount
    of robber crabs in this scrub, and to-night we can get as many as we want,
    if we can make a bright fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By dark we had succeeded in carrying up thirty or forty coconut branches,
    and covering our sleeping place over in a more satisfactory manner, though
    we were every now and then chilled to the bone by the stinging rain. Our
    rifles, matches, tobacco, and a few biscuits, we placed in a dry spot, and
    then built up a small but hot fire of roots under the shelter, and, after
    eating a meal of coconut and biscuit, we filled our pipes, piled on more
    roots, and sat by the fire drying our clothes, and listening to the wild
    uproar of wind and sea, congratulating ourselves upon being in a spot where
    we were at least safe from the wind, for our camp was at least eight or ten
    feet below the general level of the island, both on its windward and leeward
    sides.</p>
  <p>All that night the wind blew with terrific violence, and the noise of the
    surf thrashing upon the coral barriers of the island was something indescribable.
    At about midnight, just after a lull succeeded by a heavy fall of rain, the
    wind hauled round two or three points to the southward, and, if possible,
    blew with still greater violence. The crashing of trees mingling with the
    demoniacal shriek of the hurricane, was enough to disturb the mind of the
    bravest; but my companion lay quietly beside the fire, smoking his pipe and
    talking to me as he would had we been seated at the supper table on board
    the <i>Fray Bentos</i>. Yet that he was deeply anxious about our ship-mates
    I well knew, when, bidding me good-night, he laid his great frame upon the
    sand and went to sleep.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>Chapter V</b></h3>
  <p>By dawn on the following morning, the hurricane had lost its strength and
    settled down into a hard gale from the north-east. When we crawled out from
    our shelter, a fearful scene of desolation met our eyes; not more than a
    hundred coco-palms were left standing on the weather side of the island,
    and enormous boulders of coral rock, torn off the reef by the violence of
    the sea, were piled up in wild confusion along the shore, while, at the north
    end, the surf had made a clean breach over the land, with devastating effect.
    On the inner beach of the lagoon, the destructive results of the wind and
    sea had not been so great, although vast numbers of fish were lying dead
    on the sand, or among the soaked and flattened undergrowth above high water
    mark. We at once collected a few, lit a fire, roasted them over the coals,
    and made a good breakfast, finishing up with some young drinking coconuts,
    hundreds of which were lying about us.</p>
  <p>We knew that, until the weather moderated, there was little likelihood of
    our seeing the brigantine and cutter&mdash;if we ever saw either again. The
    ocean for many hundreds of miles around us was full of dangers, for it was
    unsurveyed, and risky even to a ship in good weather. Many of the islands,
    shoals and reefs marked on the charts had no existence, but still more were
    placed in wrong positions, and we both felt that it would be something marvellous
    if the two vessels escaped disaster. All we could do was to hope for the
    best, and wait patiently.</p>
  <p>As the rain had ceased, and the sun was shining brightly, although the gale
    was still blowing fiercely, we decided to cross to one of the other islands
    and make an examination of our surroundings. First of all, however, we examined
    our stock of ammunition, and found we had thirty-five cartridges between
    us; the rest of our effects consisted of about a quarter of a pound of plug
    tobacco, a sheath knife and a pocket knife, a small box of vestas, and the
    clothes we had on.</p>
  <p>With some difficulty we managed to wade through the shallow passage dividing
    the island on which we had slept from the next, and found the latter to be
    much better wooded, wider, and three or four feet higher; and I had just
    observed to Yorke that it would suit us better to live on than the other,
    when I came to a dead stop&mdash;right in front of us was a banyan tree,
    from a low branch of which was suspended a huge cane-work fishing basket!</p>
  <p>In a moment we hid ourselves, and remained quiet for a few minutes, scanning
    the surrounding bush carefully to see if there were any further signs of
    human occupancy, or the humans themselves. From the appearance of the basket,
    however, I judged that it had not been used for many weeks at least, and
    had been hung up to prevent its becoming rotten from lying on the moist,
    steamy soil.</p>
  <p>After satisfying ourselves that there were no natives&mdash;in our immediate
    vicinity at least&mdash;we set out again, proceeding very cautiously, and
    a short distance further on struck a dearly-defined native path; this we
    followed, and presently came in sight of half a dozen small thatched huts,
    under the shelter of two very large trees, from the branches of which were
    hanging fish baskets similar to that we had just seen. Most of the huts,
    though damaged by the storm, were substantially built, and evidently had
    not long been vacated, for in a sort of cleared plot in front were a number
    of gaily-coloured crotons, which showed signs of having been recently tended&mdash;the
    grass had been pulled up around their roots, &amp;c. In one of the huts we
    found some smaller fish traps, a number of fish spears, and two large wooden
    bowls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fishing village, belonging to the niggers on the mainland,
    I think,&rdquo; I said to Yorke. &ldquo;It is quite a common thing for them,
    both in New Ireland and New Britain, to have plantations or fishing stations
    on many of these small islands off the coast, and they come over three or
    four times a year to plant or fish. Let us go on further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My surmise was correct, for, quite near the huts, was a large taro plantation,
    on which great labour and care had been expended. A brief examination of
    some of the tubers showed us that they were full grown. This was not a pleasant
    discovery, for we knew that the owners might be expected to put in an appearance
    at any moment after the gale ceased, in order to dig them up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, let us get on, and see what else we can discover,&rdquo; said
    Yorke, shouldering his rifle. &ldquo;The beggars can&rsquo;t get across from
    the mainland in such weather as this, so we need not be under any immediate
    alarm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By two in the afternoon we had thoroughly examined the whole of the four
    islands, but found no more houses, though on all of them we came across the
    inevitable fish-traps, and also a good-sized bamboo fishing raft, lying far
    up on the beach. This we at once carried off, and were about to hide in a
    thicket&mdash;little thinking it would prove such a dangerous acquisition&mdash;when
    Yorke suggested a better course. It would be a mistake, he said, to leave
    the raft so far from our sleeping place, instead of taking it away, when
    not only should we have it near us in case of a sudden attack by the natives,
    but we could utilise it for fishing, and that by removing it to the southernmost
    islet, which was farthest away from the fishing village on the largest island,
    we could easily conceal it from view.</p>
  <p>The natives, he argued, would be bound to search for it on the islet where
    they had left the thing, and would conclude that it had been washed away
    in the hurricane, and therefore were hardly likely to come down to the southern
    islet, the inner beach of which could be seen from nearly every point on
    the lagoon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you see that if the black gentry do
    think that their raft might have been carried down to the inner beach of
    the south islet, they will only need to use their eyes to show them it isn&rsquo;t
    there. But it will be snug enough on the outer side of the island, where
    they won&rsquo;t dream of looking for it, and where we can use it whenever
    we like&mdash;for we&rsquo;ll shift our camp down there to-day&hellip; God knows
    how long we may have to live here if anything has happened to the <i>Fray
    Bentos</i> and the <i>Francesca</i> and so we must run no needless risks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I assented, &ldquo;and see, the wind is falling steadily,
    and there&rsquo;s not much of a swell inside the lagoon now. Why not let
    us try and take the raft away with us at once, instead of coming for her
    in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We cut down a couple of young saplings for poles, carried the raft to the
    water, and launched it. It was big enough to support five or six people,
    but floated like a feather, and, to our delight, we found that we could pole
    it along in shallow water with the greatest of ease. By four o&rsquo;clock
    we reached the island, and carried our craft up from the inner beach into
    a clump of trees. This spot, we thought, would make a good camp, as from
    it we commanded not only a good view of the lagoon, but of the sea to the
    south and west, and we felt certain that if Guest turned up all right, he
    would look for us at this end of the atoll&mdash;even if he made it from
    the northward, and had to run the coast down.</p>
  <p>By supper time we had fixed ourselves up comfortably for the night. The
    rain now only fell at long intervals, the wind had fallen to a strong, steady
    breeze, and we made up a fire, and cooked some more fish, of which there
    were still numbers to be had on the beach merely for the trouble of picking
    them up. Then we ate our supper, smoked a pipeful of our precious tobacco
    between us, and discussed our plans for the morrow, Yorke listening to my
    suggestions as if they were put forward by a man of his own age and experience,
    instead of by one who was as yet but a young seaman, and a poor navigator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am quite sure,&rdquo; he said in his slow, quiet way, as he passed
    me the pipe, &ldquo;that you and I will get along here all right for weeks,
    months&mdash;years even, if it has pleased the Almighty to take our shipmates,
    and we have to live here till we are taken off by some ship, or can build
    a boat. Your knowledge of ways and means of getting food, and living in such
    a place as this, is of more value than my seamanship and knowledge of navigation.
    Come, let us get out to the beach and take a look at the weather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He placed his hand on my shoulder in such a kindly manner, as his bright
    blue eyes looked into mine, that, with the impulsiveness of youth, together
    with my intense admiration for the character of the man himself, I could
    not help saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Yorke! Please don&rsquo;t think I was boasting of what I
    could do in the way of getting food for us&mdash;and all that. You see, I
    have been in the South Seas ever since I was a kid&mdash;and by nature I&rsquo;m
    half a Kanaka. I&rsquo;ve lived among natives so long, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held up his hand, smiling the while: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have such
    a good comrade as you, Drake. You have the makings of a good sailorman in
    you, but you&rsquo;re too quick and excitable, and want an old wooden-headed,
    stolid buffer like me to steady you. Now let us start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We walked across the narrow strip of land to the weather side, and sat down
    upon a creeper-covered boulder of coral rock. Before us the ocean still heaved
    tumultuously, and the long, white-crested breakers thundered heavily on the
    short, fringing reef; but overhead was a wondrous sky of myriad stars, set
    in a vault of cloudless blue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gale is blowing itself out,&rdquo; said my companion.  &ldquo;We
    shall see a fine day in the morning. And, Drake, we shall see the brigantine
    back in three days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I said, laughingly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid
    we won&rsquo;t. Both the brigantine and cutter must have had to heave to,
    or else run, and if they have run, they may be two hundred miles away from
    here by now. And I think that Guest <i>would</i> run to the westward for
    open water, instead of heaving-to among such an infernal lot of reefs and
    shoals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever he may have done, he, and my cutter, too, are safe, and
    we shall see them back in three days,&rdquo; he reiterated, with such quiet
    emphasis, and with such a strangely confident, contented look in his eyes,
    that I also felt convinced the vessels would, as he said, turn up safely.</p>
  <p>We sat silent for some minutes, watching the sea, and noting how quickly
    the wind was falling, when presently my comrade turned to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You asked me why I did not try to make the German head station in
    Blanche Bay, after my crew were killed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll
    tell you. I am frightened of no man living, but I happened to hear the name
    of the manager there&mdash;a-Captain Sternberg, an ex-captain of the German
    navy. He and I served together in the same ship&mdash;and I am a deserter
    from the German service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was astonished. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;surely you are
    not a German?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, I am,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and if I fell into the hands
    or the German naval authorities, or any German Consul, or other official
    anywhere, I should have but a short time in this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what could they do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send me home to be tried&mdash;and shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely they cannot shoot a man for desertion in the German navy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is something beyond desertion in my case&mdash; I killed an
    officer. Sternberg knows the whole story, and though as a man and a gentleman
    he would feel for me, he would have no hesitation in arresting me and sending
    me home in irons, if he could get me. And he could not fail to recognise
    me, although eight and twenty years have passed since he last saw me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he is not an Imperial officer now,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he is. He is Vice-Consul for Germany in the Western Pacific,
    and, as such, would have authority to apprehend me, and apprehend me he certainly
    would, though, as I have said, he knows my story, and when we served together,
    was always a kind and good friend to me, despite the fact that he was an
    officer and I was not; for I came from as good a family as his own&mdash;and
    that goes a long way in both the German army and navy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I made some sympathetic remark, and then Yorke resumed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I am telling you now&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole
    story&mdash;is no secret, for thousands of people have read of the Brandt
    extradition case in the United States. Twenty years ago I was arrested in
    San Francisco at the instance of the German Consul there, but managed to
    escape after being in custody for six weeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My real name is Brandt. My father was a German, my mother a Danish
    lady&mdash;a native of Klampenborg, a small sea-coast town not far from Copenhagen.
    My father was an officer in the army, and was well-known as an Asiatic traveller
    and linguist, and I was the only child. At fifteen years of age, much to
    my delight, I went into the navy, served one commission in the Baltic, and
    two on the west coast of South America. Then when I was about twenty-one
    years of age, I was given, through my father&rsquo;s influence, a minor position
    on the staff of a scientific expedition sent out by the German Geographical
    Society to Arabia. I came home at the end of a year, and was given three
    months&rsquo; leave, at the end of which I was to join a new ship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being pretty liberally supplied with money by my father&mdash;who
    was a man of means&mdash;I determined to spend my leave in London, and there
    I met the woman who was to prove the ruin of my future. She was the daughter
    of the woman in whose house I lodged in Chelsea, and was a very handsome,
    fascinating girl about nineteen. I fell madly in love with her, and she professed
    to return my feelings, and I, poor young fool, believed in her. Her mother,
    who was a cunning old harridan, and greedy and avaricious to a degree, gave
    us every opportunity of being together. As I spent my money most lavishly
    on the girl, and they both knew my father was well-off, and I was the only
    son, they had merely to spread their net for me to fall into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I married the girl, both she and her mother promising to keep
    the matter secret from my parents until after I returned from my next voyage
    and got a commission. I knew well that I should get into very serious trouble
    with my superiors if the fact of my marriage became known, but was so infatuated
    with the girl that I allowed no considerations to influence me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A month before my leave expired, I sent my wife over to Bremerhaven,
    where I had some friends on whose secrecy I could rely. My ship&mdash;a small
    gunboat&mdash;was being fitted out at that port, and my wife seemed delighted
    that she would see me pretty frequently before I sailed. I was cautious enough
    not to travel with her from London, for that would have meant almost certain
    detection, and, as an additional precaution, she went to my friends in Bremerhaven
    under her maiden name. I was to follow her in a week, by the next steamer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That evening, as I was being driven home to my wife&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s
    house in Chelsea, the horse bolted. I was thrown out of the cab, and half-an-hour
    later, I was in a hospital with a broken arm and severe internal injuries.
    It was six weeks before I was able to leave England to join my ship; but
    my father had written to the navy office, telling of my accident, and my
    leave had been extended. During all this time my wife wrote to me weekly,
    telling me she was very miserable at my not allowing her to return to England
    to nurse me, but would obey me; for I had written to her and told her not
    to return, as I did not think it advisable&mdash;the doctors and nurses at
    the hospital knew I was in the German navy, and I was then becoming somewhat
    fearful of the news of my marriage getting to the knowledge of the naval
    authorities.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I reached Bremerhaven, I had still three days of my extended
    leave to expire, so had no need to report myself; but at once went to my
    friends&rsquo; house, where I met my wife, who was overjoyed to see me again.
    My friends, too, welcomed me warmly, though I somehow fancied there seemed
    to be some underlying restraint upon them. They were quite a young couple:
    the husband was a clerk in the customhouse, and he and I had been friends
    from boyhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the morning I went to look at my new ship, and was greatly pleased
    to find that my old officer, Lieutenant Sternberg, had been appointed to
    her. He saw me at once, came along the deck, and spoke very kindly to me.
    Whilst he was talking to me, an officer from the port guardship came on board.
    He was a very handsome man, about thirty, with a deep scar across his forehead,
    and I noticed that he looked at me very keenly&mdash;almost rudely&mdash;and
    I fancied I saw something like a sneer on his face as he turned away to speak
    to Sternberg.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My young friend, the custom house clerk, whose name was Muller, returned
    every day from his office at six o&rsquo;clock, when we had supper, and on
    this occasion I began to tell him of my new ship, and then said casually:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way, who is that conceited-looking fellow from the guardship&mdash;a
    man with an ugly scar across his forehead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one answered, and then to my surprise I saw that Muller was looking
    inquiringly at my wife, whose face suddenly became scarlet, while Mrs. Muller
    bent her face over her plate. Then Muller looked at me and said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was Captain Decker. I believe that he has the honour
    of the friendship of Frau Brandt.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was something so stern in his tones that I could not understand;
    but another look at my wife&rsquo;s face filled me with the blackest misgivings.
    She had turned a deathly pale, and, faltering something inaudible, rose from
    the table and went to her room. Then I asked Muller what it meant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ask your wife,&rsquo; he said sadly; &lsquo;you are my dear
    friend, and she is my guest&mdash;but her conduct has not been satisfactory.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I now insisted upon him telling me more, and soon learnt the whole
    miserable story. My wife had been in the habit of meeting Captain Decker
    clandestinely ever since she had been in Bremerhaven, although she had denied
    it when Mrs. Muller had indignantly threatened to write and tell me if she
    did not at once cease the intimacy. This she had sworn to do, but, Muller
    said, she had, he feared, violated her promise frequently, though he could
    not absolutely prove it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went direct to my wife. Instead of a shrinking, trembling woman,
    I found a defiant devil&mdash;a shameless creature who coolly admitted her
    guilt, told me that she had never cared for me, and that she had only married
    me to escape from the monotony of her London life with her mother&mdash;if
    she was her mother, she added with a mocking laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank God, I didn&rsquo;t hurt her! The revelation was a heavy one,
    but I braced myself up, and the rage and contempt that filled me were mingled
    with some sort of pity. I did not even reproach her. I had in my pockets
    about thirty pounds in English gold. I put down twenty on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are twenty pounds,&rsquo; I said&mdash; &lsquo;take it
    and go. I will send you another two hundred pounds as soon as I can communicate
    with my father&mdash;on one condition.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she said sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That you&rsquo;ll never try to see me, or harass me again.
    If you do, by God! I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise you that much,&rdquo; she replied. In half an hour she
    had left the house, and I never saw or heard of her again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That evening I made special preparations. First of all I wrote to
    my poor father, and told him everything, and bade Muller and his wife goodbye,
    telling them I was going on board my ship. They, pitying me deeply, bade
    me farewell with tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I had no such intention. I wanted to settle scores with the man
    who had wronged me. At a marine store dealer&rsquo;s that night I bought
    two common cutlasses, and waited for my chance. I had learnt that Decker
    went to the service club on certain evenings, and stayed very late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My time came the following night. I saw my man come out of the club,
    and followed him closely till he entered a quiet street. Then I called him
    by name. He turned and faced me and asked me angrily what I wanted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am Theodor Brandt,&rsquo; I said, and handed him one of
    the two cutlasses I was carrying under my overcoat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man was no coward, and fought well, but in less than a minute
    I ran him clean through the body. He fell in the muddy street, and by the
    time I had dragged him away into the shadow of a high wooden fence enclosing
    a timber yard, was dead. Half an hour later I was on board a fishing-smack,
    bound for Wangeroog, one of the Frisian Islands, off the coast. At that place
    I remained in safety for a month, then got away to Amsterdam, and from there
    to Java. Then for the next eight-and-twenty years, down to this very moment,
    I have been a wanderer on the face of the earth. Six years after I escaped
    I joined an American man-of-war&mdash;the <i>Iroquois</i>&mdash;at Canton,
    and when we were paid off in the States I took out my naturalisation papers.
    This served me well, when, two years afterwards, I was recognised at San
    Francisco by some German bluejackets as &lsquo;Brandt, the murderer of Captain
    Decker,&rsquo; and arrested. Fortunately, I had money, and while the German
    Consul was trying hard to get me handed over to the German naval authorities
    on the Pacific Coast, my lawyers managed to get me out on bail. I got away
    down to the Hawaiian Islands in a lumber ship, and&mdash;well, since then
    I&rsquo;ve been knocking around anywhere and everywhere&hellip;Come, let us
    turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>Chapter VI</b></h3>
  <p>At dawn the wind had died away to a light breeze, and the sun rose to shine
    upon an ocean of unspecked blue. To the eastward, the slopes of New Britain
    were hidden from our view by a thick mist, only the tops of some high mountain
    peaks far inland showing above, and there seemed to be every appearance of
    the fine weather lasting. This gave us much satisfaction, and after a bathe
    in a rocky pool on the reef, we ate our breakfast of fish and coconut with
    good spirits, then filling our pipes, went down to the inner beach to bask
    in the glorious sunshine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If this sort of weather keeps up,&rdquo; I remarked to Yorke, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    afraid your prediction about our seeing Guest and the cutter in another two
    days won&rsquo;t be verified&mdash;it&rsquo;ll fall calm before noon to-day,
    and may keep so for a week. I&rsquo;ve known a calm to last for a solid ten
    days on the north side of New Britain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but then the current about
    here sets strongly to the eastward, and somehow I feel certain that, wind
    or no wind, we&rsquo;ll see the ships.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if we do, you ought to give up sailoring, Captain Yorke, and
    go into business as a prophet. I for one would always come to you for a tip.
    But, joking apart, let us imagine that Guest or the cutter did not run far
    to the eastward, but hove-to, and as soon as the hurricane had blown itself
    out, headed back for us; in such a case, both vessels may be within half
    a day&rsquo;s sail of us at this very moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is quite possible&mdash;it is also possible they may be within
    twenty miles of us, becalmed. It would not surprise me if Guest actually
    drifts in sight of these islands, and comes to look for us in his boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now that brings me to the kernel of my imagination. I think it very
    likely he may have no boat to send, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave me a mighty thump on the back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good boy! I know what you&rsquo;re thinking of&mdash;the raft?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly, Captain. So don&rsquo;t you think it would be as well for
    us to turn to at once, and make a couple of good paddles? though in an emergency
    the butt ends of dry coconut branches do very well for paddles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then I went on to say that it was quite likely that Guest had lost both
    his boats, and the cutter her dingy, before there was time to have them properly
    secured; and that the brigantine had lost the whaler, which had brought us
    ashore, I was sure of, for she had, as I have mentioned, been nearly thrown
    over on her beam ends when struck by the first blast, and the boat must certainly
    either have been hopelessly stove when she was forced below, or torn away
    from the davits by the weight of water in her when the ship righted herself.</p>
  <p>We set to at once with a good will&mdash;Yorke overhauling the cane fastenings
    with which the great bamboos were lashed together, whilst I went along the
    beach in search of some young <i>futu</i> trees, the wood of which is soft
    when green, but dries hard, and could be easily worked, even by such a tool
    as a sheath knife.</p>
  <p>A quarter of a mile from our camp I found just what I wanted&mdash;three
    or four young <i>futu</i> saplings lying on the ground, torn up by the roots.
    Taking two of the best, I stripped off the branches, and returned to my companion,
    who was still at work on the raft, relashing its timbers wherever needed.</p>
  <p>In a couple of hours I had made quite a decent pair of paddles, each about
    four feet in length, and with four inches of blade in the widest part. Then
    Yorke, having finished with the raft, went with me along the beach, and collected
    some old coconuts for food, and some young ones to drink, for, as my comrade
    observed, one never knew what might happen, and it would be as well to have
    some provisions all ready to hand in case of emergency. There were still
    thousands of dead fish to be seen everywhere lying on the sand, cast up among
    the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> above high-water mark, but these were now turning
    putrid, and of no use.</p>
  <p>We had noticed a huge banyan tree not far distant from our sleeping place,
    which was the roosting and breeding place of a vast number of whale birds,
    so Yorke proposed that we should go there and see if we could kill some by
    hurling sticks at them. We had often seen this done by the natives of the
    western Caroline Islands, for the birds are very stupid, and allow themselves,
    when not on the wing, to be approached quite closely. We cut ourselves each
    a half-dozen of short, heavy throwing-sticks of green wood, and set out for
    the rookery, and within an hour had killed thirty or forty of the poor birds,
    some of which we at once picked, cleaned, and roasted. We had no lack of
    salt, for every rock and shrub above high-water mark on the weather side
    of the island was covered with a thin incrustation of it, caused by the rapid
    evaporation of the spray under a torrid sun. The remainder of the birds we
    cooked later in the day, intending them as a stand-by.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon we again bathed, this time in the lagoon, and Yorke, who
    was one of the strongest and swiftest swimmers, for an European, that I had
    ever seen, succeeded in capturing a turtle which was lying asleep on the
    surface of the water, and brought it ashore; but it proved to be so old and
    poor that we let it go again in disgust.</p>
  <p>Towards the close of the day we again crossed the islet to have a better
    look at the New Britain shore, the heavy mist which had hung over it most
    of the day having now vanished. That the native owners of the plantations
    would put in an appearance before many days had passed I was certain, for
    they would be anxious to see what damage had been done by the hurricane,
    and no doubt dig up some of the taro, which, as I have said, was fully grown.</p>
  <p>The moment we emerged from the scrub out upon the eastern shore, we obtained
    a splendid view of the opposite coast of the great island, though the actual
    shore was not visible on account of the extreme lowness of the belt of littoral,
    which was many miles in width; but by climbing a tree we could just discern
    the long, dark line of palms, and here and there a narrow strip of white,
    denoting either surf or a sandy beach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I said to Yorke, &ldquo;that land cannot be more than
    five miles distant to its nearest point, and if there are niggers living
    there we should see their fires to-night, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next moment I uttered a loud hurrah! and nearly fell off the tree in
    my excitement, for away on the northern horizon was a sail, shining snowy-white
    in the rays of the sinking sun!</p>
  <p>Yorke echoed my cheer. &ldquo;A day sooner than I prophesied, Drake! Wish
    we had a glass, so that we could make out which it is. I am rather inclined
    to think it is the <i>Fray Bentos</i> it looks too big for the cutter. Anyway,
    whichever it is, she&rsquo;s becalmed; but even if there is not a breath
    of wind during the night, she&rsquo;ll be closer in in the morning, as the
    current is bound to set her along this way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We descended from the tree jubilantly, and I suggested that we should make
    a big blaze on the eastern shore, so as to let the ship know we saw her,
    but the more cautious Yorke said it would be rather risky. Natives, he said,
    might be quite near at that moment, a party of canoes could have easily crossed
    over during the day, and we should be none the wiser unless we happened to
    see the reflections of their fires, after they had arrived, on the lagoon
    waters. So, after waiting another ten minutes, when the sun set, we returned
    to camp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us kill the fatted calf and divide it between us,&rdquo; said
    my companion, taking our plug of tobacco and cutting it in halves;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    going to smoke all night, or at any rate until I fall asleep. Did you see
    how the sun set? Well, that thick, yellow haze means a calm to-morrow, to
    a dead certainty, and I shouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if we see Guest
    pulling into the lagoon at daylight, that is, if he has a boat left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I do not think either of us slept for more than a quarter of an hour that
    night. That Yorke could have done so, I do not doubt, but I would persist
    in talking, getting up, walking about, and smoking, and he, good-naturedly,
    kept awake on my account. The night was wondrously calm and beautiful, so
    calm and quiet that there was not the slightest surf on the outer reef, and
    the only sound that broke the silence would be the croak of some night-fishing
    bird, as it rose, prey in bill, from the slumbering lagoon.</p>
  <p>As soon as ever we could see our way through to the other side of the island,
    we were afoot, unheeding the drenching we got from the dew-soaked trees whenever
    we touched a branch. Within five minutes after we had emerged out into the
    open the sun rose, and a cheer broke from us when we saw both the cutter
    and the brigantine lying becalmed about four miles away, between the islet
    and the mainland of New Britain, and almost abreast of where we stood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have both lost all the boats, I am almost sure,&rdquo; said
    Yorke, &ldquo;or we should see one coming ashore; unless, indeed, a boat
    is already pulling down the lagoon on the other side. Let us wait an hour.
    That will decide us what to do; if we see no boat between now and then, we
    can be assured that Guest has none to send, and that he is waiting for a
    breeze, so that he can run in close to the reef, and try to get within hail
    of us. I daresay that he has a raft of some sort already made, and is trying
    to get closer to the land to send it ashore for us. So we&rsquo;ll give him
    a pleasant surprise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We waited impatiently till the hour had passed, but could see no sign of
    a boat putting off from, or on the way from the brigantine, and were then
    certain that she had none to send, as if it had left the vessel, even at
    daylight, it would have entered the lagoon and been with us by that time.</p>
  <p>Whilst we were waiting we had piled together on the shore a great heap of
    dried coconut branches, on top of which we threw masses of a thick, green,
    saline creeper. This heap we lit as a signal, and a pillar of dense smoke
    rose high in the windless atmosphere. It was answered by Guest in a few minutes&mdash;not
    by a gun, as we expected, but by a similar signal of smoke, caused by a mass
    of cotton waste being soaked in coal tar and ignited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s answering us,&rdquo; exclaimed Yorke. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s
    get the raft launched and make a start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We tore back through the scrub to our camp, I panting with excitement, Yorke
    as cool as ever. Carrying the raft down to the water we quickly put on board
    the bundles of young coconuts, not deeming it worth while to bother with
    the old ones and the cooked birds, as we quite expected to be alongside the <i>Fray
    Bentos</i> within three hours at least, the sea being as calm as a mill-pond,
    and the raft very light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go easy, my lad, go easy,&rdquo; said Yorke with a smile, as he saw
    the state of flurry I was in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got two or three hours paddling
    to do, so don&rsquo;t knock yourself up needlessly. Now, what about our rifles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had actually forgotten them, but at once ran back for them (the cartridges
    we always kept in our pockets), and picking one up in each hand, tore down
    the bank again, caught my left foot in a vine, and pitched upon my nose on
    the top of the broken coral and pebbles covering the beach with such violence
    that had it not been for the muzzle of the rifle I was carrying in my right
    hand plunging into the loose stones, and bringing me up sharply, I might
    have broken my jaw against a big boulder, which just caught me on the chin.</p>
  <p>Pretending I was not hurt, though my chin was skinned, and my shoulder was
    strained, I picked myself up, handed the rifles to Yorke, and said I was
    ready.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take a drink first,&rdquo; he said in his authoritative, yet sympathetic
    way, as he opened a young coconut. &ldquo;Then fill your pipe and rest awhile.
    We&rsquo;re in no hurry for ten minutes. Poor chap, you did do a flyer. Talk
    about the Gadarene swine! Why you could give them points in running down
    steep places!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I certainly had given myself a tremendous shaking, for I felt quite dizzy,
    but after a few draws at my pipe, said I was fit to paddle the raft to Cape
    Horn.</p>
  <p>We pushed off, then poled along shore till we came to the passage, which
    was as smooth as glass. Here, on account of the deep water, we had to take
    to our paddles, and were soon out in the open sea, heading for the vessels.
    The sun was intensely hot, but we took no heed of it, and congratulated ourselves
    upon having such a calm sea, instead of having to paddle against a swell,
    which would have greatly impeded our progress.</p>
  <p>For the first mile or so we went along in great style&mdash;then, to our
    consternation, we suddenly ran right into a heavy tide rip, and away we went
    at the rate of three or four knots an hour to the south-east, and towards
    the New Britain shore. The belt or tide-rip seemed to be about a mile in
    width, and although we paddled furiously in the endeavour to get out of the
    whirling, seething stream, it was in vain&mdash;the raft spun round and round
    with such rapidity that we lost control over, and had to let her go; for
    not only were we unable to make any headway, but the manner in which we were
    spinning round would not allow us to keep our feet, and began to make us
    sea-sick. After half an hour or more of this, we at last saw a chance of
    getting out of the rip into a side eddy; and, putting forth all our strength,
    we just succeeded in doing so, only to be menaced by a fresh and more alarming
    danger.</p>
  <p>Yorke, dashing the pouring perspiration from his brow with his hand, had
    just stood up to get a look at the brigantine and cutter, when he uttered
    an oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God, we&rsquo;re in for it now! Look, here&rsquo;s four canoes,
    filled with niggers, heading dead on for us. The beggars see us, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I stood up beside him, and saw, about a quarter of a mile away, four canoes,
    each of which was carrying six or eight natives, coming towards us at a furious
    rate. They were, like all New Britain canoes, very low down in the water,
    which, together with our own troubles when we were in the tide rip, had prevented
    our seeing them long before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky we have not wasted any of our cartridges&rdquo;  said Yorke
    grimly; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll give them all the fight they want. But let them
    get closer, while we head back for the ships. We <i>must</i> get out of this
    current&mdash;we can lick the niggers easy enough; but if we get into that
    tide-rip again, we&rsquo;ll be carried out of sight of the brigantine by
    midday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Plunging our paddles into the water, we sent our bamboo craft along till
    we were in absolute safety as far as the tide-rip was concerned. Then Yorke
    laid down his paddle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right now, Drake; and now we&rsquo;ll give these
    man-chawing beggars a bit of a surprise. They mean to knock us on the head
    in another ten minutes, and take our carcasses ashore for to-night&rsquo;s
    dinner. You are the younger man, and can shoot better than I, so I&rsquo;ll
    be polite and give you first show. Sight for five hundred yards for a trial
    shot, at the leading canoe. But wait a minute&mdash;don&rsquo;t stand up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He quickly piled up the young coconuts in a firm heap, and then stood over
    me, his own rifle in hand, whilst I knelt on the bamboos and placed my rifle
    on the top of the heap of coconuts.</p>
  <p>I am now, at this time of life, ashamed of the savage instinct that in those
    days filled me with a certain joy in destroying human life, unthinkingly,
    and without compunction. But I had been brought up in a rough school, among
    men who thought it not only justifiable, but correct and proper to shoot
    a man&mdash;black, or white, or brown, or yellow&mdash;who had done them
    any wrong. It had been my lot, in the Solomon Islands, to witness one of
    the most hideous and appalling massacres of a ship&rsquo;s crew that was
    ever perpetrated by natives&mdash;a massacre that had filled my youthful
    mind with the most intense and unreasoning hatred of all &ldquo;niggers,&rdquo; as
    we called the natives of Melanesia. The memory of that awful scene had burned
    itself upon my brain, for the captain and mate of the vessel were dear friends
    of mine, and they and their men had been cruelly slaughtered, not for any
    wrong they had done&mdash;for they were good, straight men&mdash;but simply
    because their blind confidence in the savage natives invited their destruction.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I steadied my rifle upon the top of the heap of coconuts, and waited a second
    or two till every man in the first canoe was in line. Then I pulled the trigger,
    and was thrown back bleeding and unconscious, for the rifle burst just in
    front of the breech block, which blew out and struck me on the top of my
    head, nearly fracturing my skull.</p>
  <p>When I came to again Yorke&rsquo;s face was bending over me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right, Drake. The brigantine is within a mile of
    us, coming up with a light air, and we&rsquo;ll be aboard in half an hour.
    How do you feel, my son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rockotty. Did the rifle burst?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Burst? It burst like a cannon, all but killed you, and a splinter
    hurt me in the eye. Drake, my boy, the next time you do the Gadarene swine
    trick with a cheap German Snider in your hand, see that the barrel is clear
    before you fire it. When you fell that time, your rifle barrel must have
    been pretty badly choked with sand and coral pebbles&hellip; Now lie still, and
    don&rsquo;t worry like an old maid who has lost her cat. You can do nothing,
    and will only be a damned nuisance if you <i>do</i> try to do anything. The
    brigantine will be here presently, and you&rsquo;ll get your head attended
    to, and have &lsquo;pretty-pretty&rsquo; plasters stuck on your nose and
    other parts of your facial beauties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are the niggers?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone, gone, my dear boy. Vanished, but not vanished in time enough
    for five or six of them. I have used every one of our cartridges on the four
    canoes, and have had the supreme satisfaction of knowing that I have not
    used them in vain. Now stop talking, and let me attend to the ship&mdash;the
    bamboo ship&hellip; There, put your head on my coat; and don&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>When the <i>Fray Bentos</i> sailed up alongside the raft I was lifted on
    board, and placed in my berth, and long days passed ere I saw Yorke again.</p>
  <p>When I did see him the brigantine was lying at anchor at Rook Island, and
    Guest was in my cabin telling me the story of the hurricane&mdash;of how
    he had lost the two boats within an hour&mdash;one being carried away when
    the brigantine was all but thrown over on her beam ends, and the other&mdash;the
    longboat&mdash;swept away with everything else on deck&mdash;guns, deck-houses,
    bulwarks and all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How we escaped smashing into some reef or another I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said
    Guest; &ldquo;but the strangest thing about it all is that Yorke&rsquo;s
    cutter, manned by native seamen, managed to stick so close to the <i>Fray
    Bentos</i>; for when I, running before the hurricane, with my decks swept
    with tremendous seas, suddenly ran into smooth water, brought to in fifteen
    fathoms, and dropped anchor, there was the <i>Francesca</i> cheek by jowl,
    alongside of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kanaka sailors&rsquo; eyesight,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Napoleon never
    lost sight of the brigantine for a moment! And, talking about eyesight, how
    is Yorke&rsquo;s eye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bad, bad, my boy. It is destroyed entirely, and he is now on board
    here, in my cabin. He has been asking for you. Do you feel strong enough
    to get up and see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I rose at once, and went into Guest&rsquo;s cabin. Yorke was lying in the
    skipper&rsquo;s bunk, and as I entered he extended both hands to me, and
    smiled cheerfully, though his left eye was covered with a bandage, and his
    brave, square-set face was white and drawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How are you, Drake, my boy? We had a narrow squeak, didn&rsquo;t
    we, from the niggers? And here is Captain Guest worrying and tormenting himself
    that he could not fire a gun to scare them off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I held his big, right hand between my own, and pressed it gently, for there
    was something in his one remaining eye that told me the end of all was near.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodbye, dear lad&hellip; Goodbye, Captain Guest. <i>I</i> know what
    is the matter with me&mdash;erysipelas&mdash;and erysipelas to a big, fat
    man like me means death&hellip; and if you would put a bullet through my head
    now you would do me a good turn&hellip; But here, Guest, and you, Drake&hellip; your
    hands. I&rsquo;ll be dead by to-morrow morning, and want to say goodbye,
    and wish good luck to you both, before I begin babbling silly twaddle about
    things that are of no account now&hellip; of no account now&hellip; not worth speaking
    about now. But the South Seas are a rotten sort of a place, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheColonialMortuaryBard"></a>The Colonial Mortuary Bard</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>A writer in the <i>Sydney Evening News</i> last  year gave that journal some amusing extracts from the visitors&rsquo; book at Longwood,  St. Helena. If the extracts are authentic copies of the original entries, they deserve  to be placed on the same high plane as the following, which appeared in a Melbourne  newspaper some years ago:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Our Emily was so fair<br>
  That the angels envied her,<br>
  And whispered in her ear,<br>
&lsquo;We will take you away on Tuesday night!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I once considered this to be the noblest bit of  mortuary verse ever written; but since reading the article in the Sydney paper I  have changed my opinion, and now think it poor. Bonaparte, however, was a great  subject, and even the most unintelligent mortuary verse-maker could not fail to  achieve distinction when the Longwood visitors&rsquo; book was given up unto him. Frenchmen,  especially, figure largely. Here, for instance:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Malidiction.<br>
  O grand homme!<br>
  O grand Napoleon!<br>
  Mais la France et toi aont venge&mdash;<br>
Hudson Lowe est mort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last line is so truly heroic&mdash;French heroic.  It instantly recalled to me a tale told by an English journalist who, on a cycling  tour in France just after the Fashoda crisis, left his &ldquo;bike&rdquo; under the care of  the proprietor of an hotel in Normandy. In the morning he found the tyres slashed  to pieces, and on the saddle a gummed envelope, on which was bravely written, &ldquo;Fashoda.&rdquo;  This was unintentional mortuary poetry. The gallant Frenchman who did the daring  deed when the owner of the &ldquo;bike&rdquo; was asleep did not realise that the word itself  was a splendid mortuary epic for French aspirations generally.</p>
<p>Then comes something vigorous from one &ldquo;Jack Lee-Cork,&rdquo;  who writes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The tomb of Napoleon  we visit to-day,<br>
  And trod on the spot where the tyrant lay;<br>
  That his equal again may never appear,<br>
&rsquo;Twill be sincerely prayed for many a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masters and officers of some of the whale-ships  touching at St. Helena seem to have made pilgrimages to Longwood. Mr. William Miller,  master of the barque <i>Hope</i>, of New Bedford, writes that he &ldquo;visited the remains  of the greatest warrior of the day, interred for twenty years.&rdquo; Then he breaks out  into these noble lines:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Here lies the warrior,  bravest of the brave,<br>
Visited by Miller, God the Queen may save.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a Britisher I shake your hand, William. When  you wrote that, forty years ago, American whaling or any other kind of skippers  did not particularly care about our nation; but you, William, were a white man.  How easily you might have said something nasty about us and made &ldquo;brave&rdquo; rhyme with  &ldquo;grave&rdquo;! But you were a real poet, and above hurting our feelings.</p>
<p>Captain Miller was evidently accompanied by some  of his crew, one of whom contributes this gem of prose:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Louis F. Waldron, on bord the barke hope of nubedford,  its boat steer, has this day been to see boney&rsquo;s tomb; we are out 24 munts, with  13 hundred barils of sperm oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All greasy luck attend you, honest Louis, boatsteerer,  in the shades beyond. You wielded harpoon and lance better than the pen, and couldn&rsquo;t  write poetry. Your informing statement about the &ldquo;ile&rdquo; at once recalled to memory  an inscription upon the wooden head-board of the grave of another boatsteerer which  in 1873 was to be seen at Ponap&eacute;, in the Caroline Islands:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;Sacred to Memory of Jno.<br>
  Hollis of sagharbour<br>
  boatsterer of ship Europa of new<br>
  Bedford who by will of<br>
  almity god died of four ribs stove in by a<br>
  SpermWhale<br>
  off pleasant island north pacific<br>
4.17.69.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sailors love the full-blooded, exhaustive mortuary  poem as well as any one, and generally like to describe in detail the particular  complaint or accident from which a shipmate died. Miners, too, like it. Many years  ago, in a small mining camp on the Kirk River, in North Queensland, I saw the following  inscription painted on the head-board of the grave of a miner who had fallen down  a shaft:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Remember, men, when  you pass by,<br>
  What you are now, so once was I.<br>
  Straight down the Ripper No. 3 shaft I fell;<br>
The Lord preserve my soul from hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Palmer River diggings (also in North Queensland)  one William Baker testified to his principles of temperance in the following, written  on the back of his &ldquo;miner&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; which was nailed to a strip of deal from a packing-case:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Bill Baker is my name,<br>
  A man of no faim,<br>
  But I was 1 of the First<br>
  In this great Land of thirst<br>
  To warn a good mate<br>
  Of the sad, dreadful fate,<br>
  That will come to him from drink.<br>
&mdash;Wm. Baker of S. Shields, England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But let me give some more quotations from the Longwood  visitors&rsquo; book. Three midshipmen of the <i>Melville</i> irreverent young dogs, write:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;We three have endeavoured, by sundry potations  of Mrs. T&mdash;&rsquo;s brandy, to arrive at a proper pitch of enthusiasm always felt, or  assumed to be, by pilgrims to this tomb. It has, however, been a complete failure,  which I fear our horses will rue when we arrive at the end of our pilgrimage.&mdash;Three  Mids. of the <i>Melville</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is another gross insult to France&mdash;an insult  which, fortunately for England, has escaped the notice of the French press. And  now two more extracts from the delicious article in the Sydney paper:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;William Collins, master of the <i>Hawk</i> of  Glasgow, from Icaboe, bound to Cork for orders. In hope never to have anything to  do with the dung trade! And God send us all a good passage home to old England.  Amen! At Longwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sympathise with <i>you</i>, good William! You  describe the guano-carrying industry by a somewhat rude expression; but as a seafaring  man who has had the misfortune to be engaged in the transportation of the distressful  but highly useful product, I shake your hand even as I shake the greasy hand of  Mr. William Miller, the New Bedford blubber-hunter. My benison on you both.</p>
<p>The last excerpt in the book is&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;One murder makes a  villain, millions a hero;&rdquo;</p>
<p>and underneath a brave Frenchman writes&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You lie&mdash;you God-dam  Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ReoTheFisherman"></a>&ldquo;&rsquo;Reo,&rdquo; The Fisherman</b></h2>
<p>&rsquo;Reo was a short, squat  Malayan, with a face like a skate, barring his eyes, which were long, narrow  slits, apparently expressing nothing but supreme indifference to the world in  general. But they would light up sometimes with a merry twinkle when the old  rogue would narrate some of his past villainies.</p>
<p>He came to Samoa in the old, old days&mdash;long  before Treaties, and Imperial Commissioners, and other gilded vanities were  dreamt of by us poor, hard-working traders. He seemed to have dropped from the  sky when one afternoon, as Tom Denison, the supercargo, and some of his friends  sat on Charley the Russian&rsquo;s verandah, drinking lager, he marched up to them,  sat down on the steps, and said, &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; said Schl&uuml;ter, the skipper of the <i>Anna  Godeffrey</i>. &ldquo;Who <i>are</i> you? Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Reo waved a short,  stumpy and black clay pipe to and fro, and replied vaguely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, from somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some one laughed, surmising correctly enough  that he had run away from a ship; then they remembered that no vessel had even  touched at Apia for a month. (Later on he told Denison that he had jumped  overboard from a Baker&rsquo;s Island guano-man, as she was running down the coast,  and swum ashore, landing at a point twenty miles distant from Apia. The natives  in the various villages had given him food, so when he reached the town he was  not hungry.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, anyway?&rdquo; asked Schl&uuml;ter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some tobacco, please. And a dollar or two. I  can pay you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Hamilton the pilot incredulously.</p>
<p>The pipe described a semicircle. &ldquo;Oh,  to-morrow night&mdash;before, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gave him some tobacco and matches, and  four Bolivian &ldquo;iron&rdquo; half-dollars. He got up and went across to Volkner&rsquo;s  combined store and grog shanty, over the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to buy a bottle of square-face,&rdquo;  said Hamilton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He deserves it,&rdquo; said Denison gloomily. &ldquo;A  man of his age who could jump overboard and swim ashore to this rotten country  should be presented with a case of gin&mdash;and a knife to cut his throat with after  he has finished it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In about ten minutes the old fellow came out  of Volkner&rsquo;s store, carrying two or three stout fishing-lines, several packets  of hooks, and half a dozen ship biscuits. He grinned as he passed the group on  the verandah, and then squatting down on the sward near by began to uncoil the  lines and bend on the hooks.</p>
<p>Denison was interested, went over to him, and  watched the swift, skilful manner in which the thin brown fingers worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to fish?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>The broad, flat face lit up. &ldquo;Outside in the  dam deep water&mdash;sixty, eighty fa&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denison left him and went aboard the ancient,  cockroach-infested craft of which he was the heartbroken supercargo. Half an  hour later &rsquo;Reo paddled past the  schooner in a wretched old canoe, whose outrigger was so insecurely fastened  that it threatened to come adrift every instant. The old man grinned as he  recognised Denison; then, pipe in mouth, he went boldly out through the passage  between the lines of roaring surf into the tumbling blue beyond.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock, just as the supercargo and the  skipper were taking their last nip before turning in, the ancient slipped  quietly alongside in his canoe, and clambered on deck. In his right hand he  carried a big salmon-like fish, weighing about 20 lbs. Laying it down on the  deck, he pointed to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty more in canoe like that. You want some  more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denison went to the side and looked over. The  canoe was loaded down to the gunwale with the weight of fish&mdash;fish that the  lazy, loafing Apian natives caught but rarely. The old man passed up two or  three more, took a glass of grog, and paddled ashore.</p>
<p>Next morning he repaid the borrowed money and  showed Denison fifteen dollars&mdash;the result of his first night&rsquo;s work in Samoa.  The saloon-keepers and other white people said he was a treasure. Fish in Apia  were dear, and hard to get.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>On the following Sunday a marriage procession  entered the Rarotongan chapel in Matafele, and Tetarreo (otherwise &rsquo;Reo) was  united to one of the prettiest and not <i>very</i> disreputable native girls in  the town, whose parents recognised that &rsquo;Reo  was likely to prove an eminently lucrative and squeezable son-in-law. Denison  was best man, and gave the bride a five-dollar American gold piece (having  previously made a private arrangement with the bridegroom that he was to  receive value for it in fish).</p>
<p>&rsquo;Reo&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s relatives  built the newly-married couple a house on Matautu Point, and &rsquo;Reo spent thirty-five dollars in  giving the bride&rsquo;s local connections a feast. Then the news spread, and cousins  and second cousins and various breeds of aunts and half-uncles travelled up to  Matautu Point to partake of his hospitality. He did his best, but in a day or  so remarked sadly that he could not catch fish fast enough in a poor canoe. If  he had a boat he could make fifty dollars a week, he said; and with fifty  dollars a week he could entertain his wife&rsquo;s honoured friends continuously and  in a befitting manner. The relatives consulted, and, thinking they had &ldquo;a good  thing,&rdquo; subscribed, and bought a boat (on credit) from the German firm, giving  a mortgage on a piece of land as security. Then they presented &rsquo;Reo with the boat, with many  complimentary speeches, and sat down to chuckle at the way they would &ldquo;make the  old fool work,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;old fool&rdquo; went straight away to the American Consul  and declared himself to be a citizen of the United States and demanded his  country&rsquo;s protection, as he feared his wife&rsquo;s relatives wanted to jew him out  of the boat they had given him.</p>
<p>The Consul wrote out something terrifying on a  big sheet of paper, and tacked it on to the boat, and warned the surprised  relatives that an American man-of-war would protect &rsquo;Reo with her guns, and then &rsquo;Reo went inside his house and beat his wife with a canoe paddle,  and chased her violently out of the place, and threatened her male relatives  with a large knife and fearful language.</p>
<p>Then he took the boat round the other side of  the island and sold it for two hundred dollars to a trader, and came back to  Apia to Denison and asked for a passage to Tutuila, and the German firm entered  into and took possession of the mortgaged land, whilst the infuriated relatives  tore up and down the beach demanding &rsquo;Reo&rsquo;s  blood in a loud voice. &rsquo;Reo,  with his two hundred dollars in his trousers&rsquo; pocket, sat on the schooner&rsquo;s  rail and looked at them stolidly and without ill-feeling.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Denison landed the ancient at Leone Bay on  Tutuila, for he had taken kindly to the old scoundrel, who had many virtues,  and could give points to any one, white or brown, in the noble art of deep-sea  fishing. This latter qualification endeared him greatly to young Tom, who, when  he was not employed in keeping the captain sober, or bringing him round after  an attack of &ldquo;D.T.&rsquo;s,&rdquo; spent all his spare time in fishing, either at sea or in  port.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Reo settled at Leone,  and made a good deal of money buying copra from the natives. The natives got to  like him&mdash;he was such a conscientious old fellow. When he hung the baskets of  copra on the iron hook of the steelyard, which was marked to weigh up to 150  lbs., he would call their attention to the marks as he moved the heavy &ldquo;pea&rdquo;  along the yard. Then, one day, some interfering Tongan visitor examined the pea  and declared that it had been taken from a steelyard designed to weigh up to  400 lbs. &rsquo;Reo was so hurt at the  insinuation that he immediately took the whole apparatus out beyond the reef in  his boat and indignantly sunk it in fifty fathoms of water. Then he returned to  his house, and he and his wife (he had married again) bade a sorrowful farewell  to his friends, and said his heart was broken by the slanders of a vile Tongan  pig from a mission school. He would, he said, go back to Apia, where he was  respected by all who knew him. Then he began to pack up. Some of the natives  sided with the Tongan, some with &rsquo;Reo,  and in a few minutes a free fight took place on the village green, and &rsquo;Reo stood in his doorway and watched  it from his narrow, pig-like eyes; then, being of a magnanimous nature, he  walked over and asked three stout youths, who had beaten the Tongan into a  state of unconsciousness, and were jumping on his body, not to hurt him too  much.</p>
<p>About midnight &rsquo;Reo&rsquo;s house was seen to be in flames, and the owner, uttering  wild, weird screams of &ldquo;<i>Fia ola! Fia ola!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Mercy! Mercy!&rdquo;) fled down  the beach to his boat, followed by his wife, a large, fat woman, named  appropriately enough Taumafa (Abundance). They dashed into the water, clambered  into the boat, and began pulling seaward for their lives. The villagers,  thinking they had both gone mad, gazed at them in astonishment, and then went  back and helped themselves to the few goods saved from the burning house.</p>
<p>As soon as &rsquo;Reo and the good wife were out of sight of the village they put  about, ran the boat into a little bay further down the coast, planted a bag  containing seven hundred dollars, with the best of the trade goods (salved <i>before</i> the fire was discovered), and then set sail for Apia to &ldquo;get justice from the  Consul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Consul said it was a shocking outrage, the  captain of U.S.S. Adirondack concurred, and so the cruiser, with the injured,  stolid-faced &rsquo;Reo on board, steamed off to Leone Bay and gave the astounded  natives twelve hours to make up their minds as to which they would do&mdash;pay &rsquo;Reo  one thousand dollars in cash or have their town burnt. They paid six hundred,  all they could raise, and then, in a dazed sort of way, sat down to meditate as  they saw the <i>Adirondack</i> steam off again.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Reo gave his wife a small share of the  plunder and sent her home to her parents. When Tom Denison next saw him he was  keeping a boarding house at Levuka, in Fiji. He told Denison he was welcome to  free board and lodging for a year. &rsquo;Reo had his good points, as I have said.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBlackBreamOfAustralia"></a>The Black Bream Of Australia</b></h2>
<p>Next to the lordly and brilliant-hued schnapper,  the big black bream of the deep harbour waters of the east coast of Australia is  the finest fish of the bream species that have ever been caught. Thirty years ago,  in the hundreds of bays which indent the shores of Sydney harbour, and along the  Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers, they were very plentiful and of great size; now,  one over 3 lbs. is seldom caught, for the greedy and dirty Italian and Greek fishermen  who infest the harbour with their fine-meshed nets have practically exterminated  them. In other harbours of New South Wales, however&mdash;notably Jervis and Twofold Bays&mdash;these  handsome fish are still plentiful, and there I have caught them winter and summer,  during the day under a hot and blazing sun, and on dark, calm nights.</p>
<p>In shape the black bream is exactly as his brighter-hued  brother, but his scales are of a dark colour, like partially tarnished silver; he  is broader and heavier about the head and shoulders, and he swims in a more leisurely,  though equally cautious, manner, always bringing-to the instant anything unusual  attracts his attention. Then, with gently undulating tail and steady eye, he regards  the object before him, or watches a shadow above with the keenest scrutiny. If it  is a small, dead fish, or other food which is sinking, say ten yards in front, he  will gradually come up closer and closer, till he satisfies himself that there is  no line attached&mdash;then he makes a lightning-like dart, and vanishes in an instant  with the morsel between his strong, thick jaws. If, however, he sees the most tempting  bait&mdash;a young yellow-tail, a piece of white and red octopus tentacle, or a small,  silvery mullet&mdash;and detects even a fine silk line attached to the cleverly hidden  hook, he makes a stern-board for a foot or two, still eyeing the descending bait;  then, with languid contempt, he slowly turns away, and swims off elsewhere.</p>
<p>In my boyhood&rsquo;s days black-bream fishing was a  never-ending source of delight to my brothers and myself. We lived at Mosman&rsquo;s Bay,  one of the deepest and most picturesque of the many beautiful inlets of Sydney Harbour.  The place is now a populous marine suburb with terraces of shoddy, jerry-built atrocities  crowding closely around many beautiful houses with spacious grounds surrounded by  handsome trees. Threepenny steamers, packed with people, run every half-hour from  Sydney, and the once beautiful dell at the head of the bay, into which a crystal  stream of water ran, is as squalid and detestable as a Twickenham lane in summer,  when the path is strewn with bits of greasy newspaper which have held fried fish.</p>
<p>But in the days of which I speak, Mosman&rsquo;s Bay  was truly a lovely spot, dear to the soul of the true fisherman. Our house&mdash;a great  quadrangular, one-storied stone building, with a courtyard in the centre&mdash;was the  only one within a radius of three miles. It had been built by convict hands for  a wealthy man, and had cost, with its grounds and magnificent carriage drives, vineyards,  and gardens, many thousand pounds. Then the owner died, bankrupt, and for years  it remained untenanted, the recrudescent bush slowly enveloping its once highly  cultivated lands, and the deadly black snake, iguana, and &rsquo;possum harbouring among  the deserted outbuildings. But to us boys (when our father rented the place, and  the family settled down in it for a two years&rsquo; sojourn) the lonely house was a palace  of beautiful imagination&mdash;and solid, delightful fact, when we began to explore the  surrounding bush, the deep, clear, undisturbed waters of the bay, and a shallow  lagoon, dry at low water, at its head.</p>
<p>Across this lagoon, at the end near the deep water,  a causeway of stone had been built fifty-five years before (in 1820) as a means  of communication by road with Sydney. In the centre an opening had been left, about  twenty feet wide, and across this a wooden bridge had been erected. It had decayed  and vanished long, long years before we first saw the place; but the trunk of a  great ironbark tree now served equally as well, and here, seated upon it as the  tide began to flow in and inundate the quarter-mile of dry sand beyond, we would  watch the swarms of fish passing in with the sweeping current.</p>
<p>First with the tide would come perhaps a school  of small blue and silver gar-fish, their scarlet-tipped upper mandibles showing  clear of the water; then a thick, compact battalion of short, dumpy grey mullet,  eager to get up to the head of the lagoon to the fresh water which all of their  kind love; then communities of half a dozen of grey and black-striped &ldquo;black fish&rdquo;  would dart through to feed upon the green weed which grew on the inner side of the  stone causeway. Then a hideous, evil-eyed &ldquo;stingaree,&rdquo; with slowly-waving outspread  flappers, and long, whip-like tail, follows, intent upon the cockles and soft-shell  clams which he can so easily discover in the sand when he throws it upwards and  outwards by the fan-like action of his thin, leathery sides. Again more mullet&mdash;big  fellows these&mdash;with yellow, prehensile mouths, which protrude and withdraw as they  swim, and are fitted with a straining apparatus of bristles, like those on the mandibles  of a musk duck. They feed only on minute organisms, and will not look at a bait,  except it be the tiny worm which lives in the long celluroid tubes of the coral  growing upon <i>congewei</i>. And then you must have a line as fine as horsehair,  and a hook small enough&mdash;but strong enough to hold a three-pound fish&mdash;to tempt them.</p>
<p>As the tide rose higher, and the incoming water  bubbled and hissed as it poured through the narrow entrance underneath the tree-bole  on which we sat, red bream, silvery bream, and countless myriads of the small, staring-eyed  and delicate fish, locally known as &ldquo;hardy-heads,&rdquo; would rush in, to return to the  deeper waters of the bay as the tide began to fall.</p>
<p>Sometimes&mdash;and perhaps &ldquo;Red Spinner&rdquo; of the <i>Field</i> may have seen the same thing in his piscatorial wanderings in the Antipodes&mdash;huge  gar-fish of three or four feet in length, with needle-toothed, narrow jaws, and  with bright, silvery, sinuous bodies, as thick as a man&rsquo;s arm, would swim languidly  in, seeking for the young mullet and gar-fish which had preceded them into the shallow  waters beyond. These could be caught by the hand by suddenly gripping them just  abaft of the head. A Moruya River black boy, named &ldquo;Cass&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, Casanova),  who had been brought up with white people almost from infancy, was a past-master  in this sort of work. Lying lengthwise upon the tree which bridged the opening,  he would watch the giant gars passing in, swimming on the surface. Then his right  arm would dart down, and in an instant a quivering, twisting, and gleaming &ldquo;Long  Tom&rdquo; (as we called them) would be held aloft for a moment and then thrown into a  flour-sack held open in readiness to receive it.</p>
<p>Surely this was &ldquo;sport&rdquo; in the full sense of the  word; for although &ldquo;Long Tom&rdquo; is as greedy as a pike, and can be very easily caught  by a floating bait when he is hungry, it is not every one who can whip him out of  the water in this manner.</p>
<p>There were at least four varieties of mullet which  frequented the bay, and in the summer we frequently caught numbers of all four in  the lagoon by running a net across the narrow opening, and when the tide ran out  we could discern their shining bodies hiding under the black-leaved sea-grass which  grew in some depressions and was covered, even at low tide, by a few inches of water.  Two of the four I have described; and now single specimens of the third dart in&mdash;slenderly-bodied,  handsome fish about a foot long. They are one of the few varieties of mullet which  will take a hook, and rare sport they give, as the moment they feel the line they  leap to and fro on the surface, in a series of jumps and somersaults, and very often  succeed in escaping, as their jaws are very soft and thin.</p>
<p>By the time it is slack water there is a depth  of six feet covering the sandy bottom of the lagoon, the rush and bubble under the  tree-bole has ceased, and every stone, weed, and shell is revealed. Now is the time  to look on the deep-water side of the causeway for the big black bream.</p>
<p>There they are&mdash;thirty, fifty&mdash;perhaps a hundred  of them, swimming gently to and fro outside the entrance, longing, yet afraid to  enter. As you stand up, and your shadow falls upon their line of vision, they &ldquo;go  about&rdquo; and turn head on to watch, sometimes remaining in the same position, with  gently moving fins and tails, for five minutes; sometimes sinking down to the blue  depths beyond, their outlines looming grey and indistinct as they descend, to reappear  again in a few minutes, almost on the surface, waiting for the dead mullet or gar-fish  which you may perhaps throw to them.</p>
<p>The old ex-Tasmanian convict who was employed to  attend to the boat in which we boys went across to Sydney three days a week, weather  permitting, to attend school, had told us that we &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t hook e&rsquo;er a one o&rsquo; thim  black bream; the divils is that cunning, masters, that you can&rsquo;t do it. So don&rsquo;t  thry it. &rsquo;Tis on&rsquo;y a-waistin&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we knew better; we were born in the colony&mdash;in  a seaport town on the northern coast&mdash;and the aborigines of the Hastings River tribe  had taught us many valuable secrets, one of which was how to catch black bream in  the broad light of day as the tide flowed over a long stretch of sand, bare at low  water, at the mouth of a certain &ldquo;blind&rdquo; creek a few miles above the noisy, surf-swept  bar. But here, in Mosman&rsquo;s Bay, in Sydney, we had not the cunningly devised gear  of our black friends&mdash;the principal article of which was the large uni-valve <i>aliotis</i> shell&mdash;to help us, so we set to work and devised a plan of our own, which answered  splendidly, and gave us glorious sport.</p>
<p>When the tide was out and the sands were dry, carrying  a basket containing half a dozen strong lines with short-shanked, thick hooks, and  two or three dozen young gar-fish, mullet, or tentacles of the octopus, we would  set to work. Baiting each hook so carefully that no part of it was left uncovered,  we dug a hole in the sand, in which it was then partly buried; then we scooped out  with our hands a narrow trench about six inches deep and thirty or forty yards in  length, into which the line was laid, covered up roughly, and the end taken to the  shore. After we had accomplished laying our lines, radiating right and left, in  this manner we covered each tempting bait with an ordinary crockery flower-pot,  weighted on the top with a stone to keep it in its place, and then a thin tripping-line  was passed through the round hole, and secured to a wooden cross-piece underneath.  These tripping-lines were then brought ashore, and our preparations were complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; one may ask, &ldquo;all this elaborate detail,  this burying of lines, and, most absurd of all, the covering up of the baited hook  with a flowerpot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simply this. As the tide flows in over the sand  there come with it, first of all, myriads of small garfish, mullet, and lively red  bream, who, if the bait were left exposed, would at once gather round and begin  to nibble and tug at it. Then perhaps a swiftly swimming &ldquo;Long Tom,&rdquo; hungry and  defiant, may dart upon it with his terrible teethed jaws, or the great goggle-eyed,  floundering sting-ray, as he flaps along his way, might suck it into his toothless  but bony and greedy mouth; and then hundreds and hundreds of small silvery bream  would bite, tug, and drag out, and finally reveal the line attached, and then the  scheme has come to naught, for once the cute and lordly black bream sees a line  he is off, with a contemptuous eye and a lazy, proud sweep of tail.</p>
<p>When the tide was near the full flood we would  take the ends of our fishing- and tripping-lines in our hands and seat ourselves  upon the high sandstone boulders which fringed the sides of the bay, and from whence  we could command a clear view of the water below. Then, slowly and carefully, we  tripped the flower-pots covering the baits, and hauled them in over the smooth sandy  bottom, and, with the baited lines gripped tight in the four fingers of our right  hands, we watched and waited.</p>
<p>Generally, in such calm, transparent water, we  could, to our added delight, see the big bream come swimming along, moving haughtily  through the crowds of small fry&mdash;yellow-tail, ground mullet, and trumpeters. Presently,  as one of them caught sight of a small shining silvery mullet (or a luscious-looking  octopus tentacle) lying on the sand, the languid grace of his course would cease,  the broad, many-masted dorsal fin become erect, and he would come to a dead stop,  his bright, eager eye bent on the prize before him. Was it a delusion and a snare?  No! How could it be? No treacherous line was there&mdash;only the beautiful shimmering  scales of a delicious silvery-sided young mullet, lying dead, with a thin coating  of current-drifted sand upon it. He darts forward, and in another instant the hook  is struck deep into the tough grizzle of his white throat; the line is as taut as  a steel wire, and he is straining every ounce of his fighting six or eight pounds&rsquo;  weight to head seawards into deep water.</p>
<p>Slowly and steadily with him, else his many brothers  will take alarm, and the rest of the carefully laid baits will be left to become  the prey of small &ldquo;flatheads,&rdquo; or greedy, blue-legged spidery crabs. Once his head  is turned, providing he is well hooked, he is safe, and although it may take you  ten minutes ere you haul him into such shallow water that he cannot swim upright,  and he falls over upon his broad, noble side, and slides out upon the sand, it is  a ten minutes of joy unalloyed to the youthful fisherman who takes no heed of two  other lines as taut as his own, and only prays softly to himself that his may be  the biggest fish of the three.</p>
<p>Generally, we managed to get a fish upon every  one of the ten or twelve lines we set in this manner, and as we always used short,  stout-shanked hooks of the best make, we rarely lost one. On one occasion, however,  a ten-foot sawfish seized one of our baits, and then another and another, and in  five minutes the brute had entangled himself amongst the rest of the lines so thoroughly  that our old convict boatman, who was watching us from his hut, yelled out, as he  saw the creature&rsquo;s serrated snout raised high out of the water as it lashed its  long, sinuous tail to and fro, to &ldquo;play him&rdquo; till he &ldquo;druv an iron into it.&rdquo; He  thought it was a whale of some sort, and, jumping into a dinghy, he pulled out towards  it, just in time to see our stout lines part one after another, and the &ldquo;sawfish&rdquo;  sail off none the worse for a few miserable hooks in his jaws and a hundred fathoms  of stout fishing lines encircling his body.</p>
<p>This old Bill Duggan&mdash;he had &ldquo;done&rdquo; twenty-one years  in that abode of horror, Port Arthur in Tasmania, for a variegated assortment of  crimes&mdash;always took a deep interest in our black-bream fishing, and freely gave us  a shilling for each one we gave him.</p>
<p>He told us that by taking them to Sydney he could  sell them for two shillings each, and that he would send the money to a lone, widowed  sister who lived in Bridgnorth, England. Our mother deeply sympathised with the  aged William (our father said he was a lying old ruffian), and always let him take  the boat and pull over to Sydney to sell the fish. He generally came back drunk  after twenty-four hours&rsquo; absence, and said the sun had affected him. But Nemesis  came at last.</p>
<p>One day some of the officers of H.M.S. <i>Challenger</i>,  with some Sydney friends, came to spend a Saturday and Sunday with us. It rained  hard on the Saturday night, and the stream which fell into the head of the bay became  a roaring torrent, sending a broad line of yellow, muddy foam through the narrow  opening of the causeway, which I have before mentioned, into the harbour.</p>
<p>Sadly disappointed that we could not give our guests  the sport which we had promised them, we sat upon the causeway and gazed blankly  upon the yellowed waters of the bay with bitterness in our hearts. Suddenly &ldquo;Cass,&rdquo;  the Moruya River black boy, who was standing beside us, turned to us with a smile  illumining his sooty face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for you coola (angry)? Now the time to catch  big pfeller brack bream. Water plenty pfeller muddy. Brack bream baal (is not) afraid  of line now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I, being the youngest, was sent off, with furious  brotherly threats and yells, to our guests, to tell them to come down at once with  their fishing tackle. I tore up the path and reached the house. The first-lieutenant,  commodore&rsquo;s secretary, and two ladies at once rose to the occasion, seized their  beautiful rods (at which my brothers and myself were undecided whether to laugh  in contempt or to profoundly admire) and followed me down to the causeway.</p>
<p>Before we reached there Billy Duggan and my brothers  had already landed half a dozen splendid fish, one of which, of over ten pounds,  was held up to us for inspection as a curiosity, inasmuch as a deep semicircular  piece had been bitten out of its back (just above the tail) by a shark or some other  predatory fish. The wound had healed over perfectly, although its inner edge was  within a quarter of an inch of the backbone.</p>
<p>With a brief glance at the fish already taken,  the two officers and the ladies had their rods ready, and made a cast into the surging,  yellow waters, with disastrous results, for in less than three minutes every one  of them had hooked a fish&mdash;and lost it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re no fishing for finnickin&rsquo; graylin&rsquo;, or such  like pretty-pretties av of the ould counthry,&rdquo; said the old convict patronisingly,  as his toothless mouth expanded into a grin. &ldquo;These blue-nosed devils would break  the heart and soul av the best greenheart as was iver grown. Lay down thim sthicks  an&rsquo; take wan of these,&rdquo; and he pointed to some thick lines, ready coiled and baited  with pieces of raw beef. &ldquo;Just have thim out into the wather, and hould on like  grim death&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Sure the boys here have taught me a mighty lot I niver larned  before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our visitors &ldquo;hived&rdquo; out the already baited lines,  and caught a dozen or more of splendid fish, varying from 6 lbs. to 10 lbs. in weight,  and then, as a drenching downpour of rain blotted out everything around us, we went  home, leaving our take with Billy, with the exception of two or three of the largest,  which we brought home with us for supper. He whispered to my brothers and myself  that he would give us &ldquo;ten bob&rdquo; for the lot; and as the old villain&rsquo;s money was  extremely useful to us, and our parents knew nothing about our dealings with the  ancient reprobate, we cheerfully agreed to the &ldquo;ten bob&rdquo; suggestion.</p>
<p>But, as I have said, Nemesis was near to William  Duggan, Esq., over this matter of the black bream, for on the following Tuesday  Lieut. H&mdash; happened across the leading fishmonger&rsquo;s shop in Hunter Street, where  there were displayed several splendid black bream. One of these, he noticed, had  a large piece bitten out of the back, and he at once recognised it. He stepped inside  and asked the black-moustached Grecian gentleman who attended to the counter the  price of the fish, and where they were caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine shillings each, sir. They are a very scarce  fish, and we get them only from one man, an old fellow who makes his living by catching  them in Mosman&rsquo;s Bay. We give him five shillings each for every fish over 6 lbs.,  and seven-and-sixpence for every one over 10 lbs. No one else but this old fellow  can catch black bream of this size. He knows the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>H&mdash; , thinking he was doing us boys a good turn,  wrote a line to our father, telling him in a humorous manner all about this particular  wretched back-bitten black bream which he had recognised, and the price he had been  asked for it. Then my father, having no sense of humour, gave us, one and all, a  sound thrashing for taking money from old Duggan, who thereafter sold our black  bream to a hawker man who travelled around in a spring cart, and gave him three  shillings each, out of which we got two, and spent at a ship chandler&rsquo;s in buying  fresh tackle.</p>
<p>For &rsquo;twas not the &ldquo;filthy lucre&rdquo; we wanted, only  the sport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MartinOfNitendi"></a>&ldquo;Martin Of Nitendi&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p>Half-way up the side  of the mountain which overlooked the waters of the little land-locked harbour  there was a space clear of timber. Huge, jagged rocks, whose surfaces were  covered with creepers and grey moss, protruded from the soil, and on the  highest of these a man was lying at full length, looking at the gunboat  anchored half a mile away. He was clothed in a girdle of <i>ti</i> leaves only;  his feet were bare, cut, and bleeding; round his waist was strapped a leather  belt with an empty cartridge pouch; his brawny right hand grasped a Snider  rifle; his head-covering was a roughly made cap of coconut-nut leaf, with a  projecting peak, designed to shield his blood-shot, savage eyes from the sun.  Yet he had been a White Man. For nearly an hour he had been watching, ever  since the dawn had broken. Far below him, thin, wavering curls of pale blue  smoke were arising from the site of the native village, fired by the  bluejackets on the previous evening. The ruins of his own house he could  discern by the low stone wall surrounding it; as for the native huts which, the  day before, had clustered so thickly around his own dwelling, there was now no  trace save heaps of grey ashes.</p>
<p>A boat put off from the ship, and as the  yellow-bladed oars flashed in the sunlight the man drew his rifle close up to  his side and his eyes gleamed with a deadly hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officers&rsquo; shootin&rsquo; party,&rdquo; he muttered, as he  watched the boat ground on the beach and three men, carrying guns, step out and  walk up the beach&mdash; &ldquo;officer&rsquo;s shootin&rsquo; party. Christ A&rsquo;mighty! I&rsquo;d like to pot  every one o&rsquo; the swine. An&rsquo; I could do it, too, I could do it. But wot&rsquo;s the  use o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; a blarsted fool for nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat&rsquo;s crew got out and walked about the  smouldering remains of the village, seeking for curios which had escaped the  fire, pausing awhile to look at a large mound of sand, under which lay seven of  the natives killed by the landing-party on the preceding day. Then, satisfied  that there was nothing to be had, the coxswain grumblingly ordered the men back  to the boat, which pushed off and returned to the ship.</p>
<p>The wild, naked creature lying upon the  boulder saw the boat pull off with a sigh of satisfaction. There was, under the  ashes of his house, and buried still further under the soil, a 50-lb. beef  barrel filled with Chilian and Mexican dollars. And he had feared that the  bluejackets might rake about the ashes and find it.</p>
<p>He rose and stepped down the jagged boulder to  where, at the base, the thick carpet of dead leaves, fallen from the giant trees  which encompassed it, silenced even the tread of his naked feet. Seated against  the bole of a many-buttressed <i>vi</i>-tree was a native woman, whose right  arm, shattered by a bullet and bound up in the spathe of a coconut-palm, was  suspended from her neck by a strip of soft bark. She looked at him inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boat has come ashore,&rdquo; he said in the  native tongue, &ldquo;but none of the white men are seeking for my money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy money!&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s eyes blazed with a  deadly fury. &ldquo;What is thy money to me? Is thy money more to us than the blood  of our child? O, thou coward heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grasping his Snider by the tip of the barrel  the man looked at his wife with sullen, dulled ferocity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no coward, Nuta. Thou dost not  understand. I wish to save the money, but I wish for revenge as well. Yet what  can I do? I am but one man, and have but one cartridge left.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>This naked, sun-tanned being was one of the  most desperate and blood-stained beachcombers that had ever cursed the fair  isles of the South Pacific, and in those days there were many, notably on  Pleasant Island and in the Gilbert Group. Put ashore at Nitendi from a Hobart  Town whaler for mutinous conduct, he had disassociated himself for ever from  civilisation. Perhaps the convict strain in his blood had something to do with  his vicious nature, for both his father and mother had &ldquo;left their country for  their country&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; and his early training had been given him under the  shadow of the gallows and within the swishing sound of the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; as it lacerated  the backs of the wretched beings doomed to suffer under the awful convict  system.</p>
<p>From the simple, loafing beachcomber stage of  life to that of a leader of the natives in their tribal wars was a simple but  natural transition, and Jim Martin, son of a convict father and mother whose  forbears were of the scum of Liverpool, and knew the precincts of a prison  better than the open air, followed the path ordained for him by Fate.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s reckless courage won him undoubted  respect from his associates; the head chief of the village alone possessed a  greater influence. A house was built for him, and a wife and land given him;  and within a year of his arrival on the island he signalised himself by a  desperate attempt to cut-off a barque bound from Hobart to China as she lay  becalmed off the island. The attempt failed, and many of his followers lost  their lives. A few months later, however, he was more successful with a Fijian  trading cutter, which, anchoring off the village, was carried during the night,  plundered of her cargo of trade goods (much of which was firearms), and then  burnt. This established his reputation.</p>
<p>Five years passed. But few vessels touched at  the island now, for it had a bad name, and those which did call were well armed  and able to beat off an attack. Then one day, two years before the opening of  this story, a trading schooner called off the village, and Martin, now more a  savage native than a white man, was tempted by her defenceless condition, and  by the money which the captain carried for trading purposes, to capture her,  with the aid of the wild, savage people among whom he had cast his lot. Of what  use the money would be to him he knew not. He was an outcast from civilisation,  he was quickly forgetting his mother tongue; but his criminal instincts, and  his desire to be a &ldquo;big man&rdquo; with the savages among whom he had lived for so  long, led him to perpetrate this one particular crime. In the dead of night he  led a party of natives on board the schooner, and massacred every one of her  crew, save one Fijian, who, jumping overboard, swam to the shore, and was  spared. A few months later this man escaped to a passing whaler, and the story  of the massacre of the captain and crew of the <i>Fedora</i> was made known to  the commodore of the Australian station, who despatched a gunboat &ldquo;to apprehend  the murderers and bring them to Sydney for trial.&rdquo; Failing the apprehension of  the murderers, the commander was instructed &ldquo;to burn the village, and inflict  such other punitive methods upon the people generally&rdquo; as he deemed fit.</p>
<p>So Commander Lempriere, of H.M. gunboat <i>Terrier</i>,  went to work with a will. He meant to catch the murderers of the crew of the <i>Fedora</i> if they possibly could be caught, and set to work in a manner that would have  shocked the commodore. Instead of steaming into the bay on which the village  was situated&mdash;and so giving the natives ample time to clear out into the  mountains&mdash;he brought-to at dusk, when the ship was twenty miles from the land,  and sent away the landing party in three boats. The Fijian&mdash;he who had escaped  from the massacre of the <i>Fedora</i>&mdash;was the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what to do, Chester,&rdquo; said Commander  Lempriere to his first lieutenant as the boatswain&rsquo;s whistles piped the landing  party away; &ldquo;land on the north point, about two miles from the village, and  surround it, and then wait till daylight. You can do it easily enough with  thirty men, as it lies at the foot of the mountain, and there is no escape for  the beggars unless they break through you and get into the bush. Be guided by  the Fiji boy; and, as the Yankees say, &lsquo;no one wants a brass band with him when  he&rsquo;s going duck-hunting,&rsquo; so try and surround the village as quietly as  possible. I&rsquo;ll see that none of them get away in their canoes. I&rsquo;ll work up  abreast of the harbour by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guided by the boy, Lieutenant Chester and the  landing party succeeded in getting ashore without being seen, and then made a  long detour along the side of the mountain, so as to approach the village from  behind. Then they waited till daylight, and all would have gone well had not  his second in command, just as the order was given to advance, accidentally  discharged his revolver. In an instant the village was alarmed, and some  hundreds of natives, many of them armed with rifles, and led by Martin, sprang  from their huts and made a short but determined resistance. Then, followed by  their women and children, they broke through the bluejackets and escaped into  the dense mountain jungle, where they were safe from pursuit. But the fire of  the seamen had been deadly, for seven bodies were found; among them was a boy  of about ten, whom the Fijian recognised as the renegade&rsquo;s son&mdash;a stray bullet  had pierced his body as he sat crouching in terror in his father&rsquo;s house, and  another had wounded his mother as she fled up the mountainside, for in the  excitement and in the dim morning light it was impossible for the attacking  party to tell women from men.</p>
<p>Then by the commander&rsquo;s orders the village and  fleet of canoes was fired, and a dozen or so of rockets went screaming and spitting  among the thick mountain jungle, doing no damage to the natives, but terrifying  them more than a heavy shell fire. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us away from here, Nuta,&rdquo; said Martin, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis  not safe. In the hut by the side of the big pool we can rest till the ship has  gone and our people return. And I shall bind thy arm up anew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman obeyed him silently, and in a few  minutes they were skirting the side of the mountain by a narrow leaf-strewn  path, taking the opposite direction to that followed by the two officers and  bluejackets. Half an hour&rsquo;s walk brought them to the river bank, which was  clothed with tall spear-grass. Still following the path, they presently emerged  out into the open before a deep, spacious pool, at the further end of which was  a dilapidated and deserted hut. Here the woman, faint with the pain of her  wound, sank down, and Martin brought her water to drink, and then proceeded to  re-examine and properly set her broken arm.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The two officers&mdash;the second lieutenant and a ruddy-faced,  fair-haired midshipman named Walters&mdash;had hardly proceeded a hundred yards along  the beach, when the boy stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Grayling, let us turn back and go the  other way. There&rsquo;s a big river runs into the next bay, with a sort of a lake  about a mile up; I saw it in the plan of the island, this morning. We might get  a duck or two there, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way you like,&rdquo; replied the officer,  turning about, &ldquo;and walking along the beach will be better than climbing up the  mountain in the beastly heat for the sake of a few tough pigeons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Followed by the three bluejackets, who were  armed with rifles, they set off along the hard white sand. In a few minutes  they had rounded the headland on the north side and were out of sight of the  ship. For quite a mile they tramped over the sand, till they came to the mouth  of the river, which flowed swiftly and noisily over a shallow bar. A short  search revealed a narrow path leading up along the bank, first through low  thicket scrub, and then through high spear-grass. Further back, amid the dense  forest, they could hear the deep notes of the wild pigeons, but as young  Walters was intent on getting a duck they took no heed, but pressed steadily  on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jove! what a jolly fine sheet of water!&rdquo;  whispered the midshipman as they emerged out from the long grass and saw the  deep, placid pool lying before them; then he added disappointedly, &ldquo;but not a  sign of a duck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Grayling consolingly, as he  sat down on the bank and wiped his heated face, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get plenty of pigeons,  anyway. But first of all I&rsquo;m going to have something to eat and drink. Open  that bag, Williams, and you, Morris and Jones, keep your ears cocked and your  eyes skinned. It&rsquo;s lovely and quiet here, but I wouldn&rsquo;t like to get a poisoned  arrow into my back whilst drinking bottled beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a swim before I eat  anything,&rdquo; said Walters, with a laugh. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo; he asked, as he began  undressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks very tempting,&rdquo; replied the officer,  &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m too hot. Take my advice and wait a bit till you&rsquo;re cooler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngster only laughed, and, having  stripped, took a header from the bank, and then swam out into the centre of the  pool where it was deepest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do come in, sir,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just  splendid. There&rsquo;s a bit of a current here and the water is delightfully cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Martin was aroused from his sleep by the sound  or voices. He seized his rifle, bent over his wife, and whispered to her to  awake; then crawling on his hands and knees from the hut he reached the bank and  looked out, just as young Walters dived into the water.</p>
<p>Hardened murderer as he was, he felt a thrill  of horror, for he knew that the pool was a noted haunt of alligators, and to  attempt to swim across it meant certain death.</p>
<p>His wife touched his arm, and crouching beside  him, her black eyes filled with a deadly hatred, she showed her white teeth and  gave a low, hissing laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before one can count ten he will be in the  jaws,&rdquo; she said, with savage joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuta,&rdquo; whispered Martin hoarsely, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis but a  boy,&rdquo; and the veins stood out on his bronzed forehead as his hand closed  tighter around his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wouldst thou do, fool?&rdquo; said the woman  fiercely as she seized the weapon by the barrel; &ldquo;think of thy son who died but  yesterday&hellip;  ah! ah! look! look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tearing the rifle from her grasp he followed  the direction of her eyes; a swiftly-moving black snout showed less than thirty  yards from the unconscious bather, who was now swimming leisurely to the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must not die,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis but a  boy!&rdquo; Then turning to the woman he spoke aloud. &ldquo;Quick! run to the forest; I  shall follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she sought to stay his hand; he dashed  her aside, raised the rifle to his shoulder and took a quick but steady aim; a  second later the loud report rang out, and the monster, struck on his bony head  by the heavy bullet, sank in alarm; and then, ere Martin turned to run, two  other shots disturbed the silence and he pitched forward on his face into the  long grass.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just saw the beggar in time, sir,&rdquo; cried  Jones. &ldquo;I happened to look across and caught sight of him just as he fired at  Mr. Walters. Me and Morris fired together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grayling had sprung to his feet. &ldquo;Are you hit,  Walters?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the boy as he clambered up the  bank; &ldquo;what the deuce is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nigger took a pot-shot at you! Get under  cover as quick as you can. Never mind your clothes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed. No sound broke the deathly  stillness of the place; and then, cautiously creeping through the grass, the  officer and Morris crawled round to where the latter had seen the man fall.  They came upon him suddenly. He was lying partly on his face, with his eyes  looking into theirs. Morris sprang up and covered him with his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done for,&rdquo; Martin said quietly &ldquo;my back  is broken. Did the crocodile get the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crocodile!&rdquo; said Grayling in astonishment.  &ldquo;Did you fire at a crocodile? Who are you? Are you a white man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind who I am,&rdquo; he gasped; &ldquo;let me lie  here. Look,&rdquo; and he pointed to a bullet-hole in his stomach; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gone clean  through me and smashed my backbone. Let me stay as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never spoke again, and died whilst a litter  was being made to carry him down to the beach.</p>
<p align="center"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheRiverOfDreams"></a>The River Of Dreams</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>I</b></h3>
<p>There is a river I know which begins its life  in a dark, sunless canyon high up amid the thick forest-clad spurs of the range  which traverses the island from east to west. Here, lying deep and silent, is a  pool, almost encompassed by huge boulders of smooth, black rock, piled  confusedly together, yet preserving a certain continuity of outline where their  bases touch the water&rsquo;s edge. Standing far up on the mountainside you can, from  one certain spot alone, discern it two hundred feet below, and a thick mass of  tangled vine and creepers stretching across its western side, through which the  water flows on its journey to the sea.</p>
<p>A narrow native path, used only by hunters of  the wild pigs haunting the depths of the gloomy mountain forest, led me to it  one close, steaming afternoon. I had been pigeon shooting along the crests of  the ridges, and having shot as many birds as I could carry, I decided to make a  short cut down to the level ground, where I was sure of finding water, resting  awhile and then making my way home along the beach to the village.</p>
<p>I had descended scarcely more than fifty yards  when I struck the path&mdash;a thin, red line of sticky, clay soil, criss-crossed by  countless roots of the great forest trees. A brief examination showed me that  it had been trodden by the feet of natives quite recently; their footprints led  downward. I followed, and presently came to a cleared space on the  mountainside, a spot which had evidently been used by a party of hunters who  had stayed there to cook some food, for the ashes of a fire lay in the  ground-oven they had made. Laying down my gun, I went to the edge and peered  cautiously over, and there far below I could see the pool, revealed by a shaft  of sunlight which pierced down through the leafy canopy.</p>
<p>Feeling sure that the track would lead me to  the water, where I should have the satisfaction of a long drink, I set out  again, and after narrowly escaping pitching down headlong, I at last reached  the bottom, and, with a sigh of relief, threw down my gun and birds, and in  another moment was drinking eagerly of the ice-cold, crystal water in one of  the many minor pools which lay everywhere amid the boulders.</p>
<p>After a few minutes&rsquo; rest I collected some  dead wood and lit a fire, being hungry as well as thirsty; then leaving it to  burn down, I climbed one of the highest boulders to get a good view, and sighed  with admiration at the scene&mdash;there lay before me a deep, almost circular sheet  or water, about thirty yards across. Directly beneath me I could see the rocky  bottom; fifty feet further out towards the centre it was of unfathomable  blueness. On the opposite side a tree of enormous girth had fallen, long years  before, yet it was still growing, for some of its mighty roots were embedded in  the rich red soil of the mountain-side.</p>
<p>As I looked, a fish, and then another,  splashed just beside the fallen tree. Slipping down from the boulder, I made my  way round, just in time to see scores of beautiful silvery fish, exactly like  English grayling in shape, dart away from under the tree out into the deep  water. In other streams of the island I had caught many of these fish, but had  never seen any so high up inland; and, elated at the prospect of much future  sport, I went on with my explorations.</p>
<p>I was about to climb over the tree, when I  discovered that I could pass underneath, for here and there it was supported on  boulders standing out two or three feet above the water. On the other side a  tiny stream trickled over a flat ledge of rock, to fall into a second but much  smaller pool ten or fifteen feet below; beyond that lay a long, narrow but  shallow stretch of crystal water, running between highly verdured banks, and  further away in the distance I could hear the murmur of a waterfall.</p>
<p>Turning over a stone with my foot, a crayfish  darted off and tried to hide. There were scores, hundreds of them,  everywhere&mdash;fine, fat, luscious fellows, and in ten minutes I had a dozen of the  largest in my bag, to roast on the now glowing fire beside a juicy pigeon. Salt  I had none, but I did possess a ship biscuit and a piece of cold baked taro,  and with pigeon and crayfish, what more could a hungry man desire?</p>
<p>The intense solitude of the place, too, was  enchanting. Now and then the booming note of a pigeon, or the soft <i>coo-coo</i> of a ringdove, would break the silence; overhead there was a sky of spotless  blue; an hour before I had sweltered under a brazen sun; here, under the  mountain shade, though there was not a breath of wind to stir a leaf, it was  surprisingly cool.</p>
<p>To lean against the soft white moss clothing  the buttresses of a giant maruhia-tree and smoke a pipe, was delightful after a  tramp of six or eight miles through a mountain forest; and to know that the  return journey would be through easy country along the banks of a new river was  better still.</p>
<p>I set off with a feeling of joyful expectancy,  taking a last glance at the beautiful little lake&mdash;I meant to return with some  native friends to fish it on the morrow&mdash;ere I struck into the forest once more  to pick up the path.</p>
<p>Every now and then I caught glimpses of the  river, now gradually widening as it was joined by other streamlets on either  side. Some of these I had to wade through, others I crossed on stones or fallen  trees.</p>
<p>Half-way to the beach I came to a broad  stretch of shallow water covered with purple water-lilies; three small ducks,  with alarmed quacking, shot upward from where they had been resting or feeding  under the bank, and vanished over the tree-tops; and a sudden commotion in the  water showed me that there were many fish. Its beautiful clearness tempted me  to strip off and swim about the floating garden resting on its bosom, and I was  just about to undress when I heard a shot quite near. The moment after, I fired  in return, and gave a loud hail; then the high reedy cane grass on the other  side parted, and a man and a woman came out, stared at me, and then laughed in  welcome. They were one Nalik and his wife, people living in my own village. The  man carried a long single-barrelled German shot-gun, the woman a basket of pigeons.  Stepping down the bank, they waded across and joined me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came ye here?&rdquo; they asked, as we sat down  together to smoke.</p>
<p>I told them, and then learnt that the river  ran into the sea through the mangroves at a spot many miles from the village.  Then I asked about the big pool. Nalik nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, &nbsp;&rsquo;tis  deep, very deep, and hath many fish in it. But it is a place of <i>jelon</i> (haunted) and we always pass to one side. But here where we now sit is a fine  place for fish. And there are many wild pigs in the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us come here to-morrow. Let us start ere  the sun is up, and stay here and fish and shoot till the day be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Sivi his wife, puffing her  cigarette, &ldquo;and sleep here when night comes, for under the banks are many  thousand <i>unkar</i> (crayfish), and I and some other women shall catch them  by torchlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was how I began to learn this island  river and its ways, so that now it has become the river of my dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>II</b></h3>
<p>But with the dawn there came disappointment  keen and bitter, for in the night the north-east trade had died away, and now  wild, swooping rain squalls pelted and drenched the island from the westward,  following each other in quick succession, and whipping the smooth water inside  the reef into a blurred and churning sheet of foam, and then roaring away up  through the mountain passes and canyons.</p>
<p>With my gear all ready beside me, I sat on the  matted floor of the hut in which I lived, smoking my pipe and listening to the  fury of the squalls as the force of the wind bent and swayed the thatched roof,  and made the cinnet-tied rafters and girders creak and work to and fro under  the strain. Suddenly the wicker-work door on the lee side was opened, and Nalik  jumped in, dripping with rain, but smiling good-naturedly as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wo&#257;!</i>&rdquo; he said, taking his long,  straight black hair in his hands and squeezing out the water, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis no day for  us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ventured an opinion that it might clear off  soon. He shook his head as he held out his brown hand for a stiff tot of  Hollands, tossed it off, and then sat down to open a small bundle he carried,  and which contained a dry jumper and pair of dungaree pants.</p>
<p>Then quickly divesting himself of the soddened  girdle of grass around his loins, he put on the European garments, filled his  pipe, and began to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind will soon cease, for these squalls  from the westward last not long at this time of the year; but when the wind  ceases, then comes rain for two days sometimes&mdash;not heavy rain such as this, but  soft rain as fine as hair, and all the forest is wetted and the mountain paths  are dangerous even to our bare feet, and the pigeons give no note, and the sun  is dead. So we cannot go to the river to-day. To-morrow perhaps it may be fine;  therefore let us sit and be content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we sat and were content, remaining indoors  in my own house, or visiting those of our neighbours, eating, drinking,  smoking, and talking. I was the only white man on the island, and during my  three months&rsquo; residence had got to know every man, woman, child, and dog in the  village. And my acquaintance with the dogs was very extensive, inasmuch as  every one of the thirty-four families owned at least ten dogs, all of which had  taken kindly to me from the very first. They were the veriest mongrels that  ever were seen in canine form, but in spite of that were full of pluck when pig  hunting. (I once saw seven or eight of them tackle a lean, savage old wild boar  in a dried-up taro swamp; two of them were ripped up, the rest hung on to him  by his ears and neck, and were dragged along as if they were as light as  feathers, until a native drove a heavy ironwood spear clean through the  creature&rsquo;s loins.)</p>
<p>During the evening my native friends, in  response to my inquiries about the river, told me that it certainly took its  rise from the deep pool I have before described, and that had I made a more  careful examination I should have seen several tiny rivulets, hidden by the  dense undergrowth, flowing into it from both sides of the gorge. During severe  rains an immense volume of muddy water would rush down; yet, strangely enough,  the two kinds of fish which inhabited it were just as plentiful as ever as soon  as the water cleared.</p>
<p>About four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when I was  sound in slumber, a voice called to me to awaken. It was Nalik.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out and look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lifted (not opened) my Venetian-sashed door  of pandanus leaf, and stepped out.</p>
<p>What a glorious change! The rain had ceased,  and the shore and sea lay bright and clear under a myriad-starred sky of  deepest blue; the white line of surf tumbling on the barrier reef a mile away  seemed almost within stone-throw. A gentle breeze swayed the fronds of the  coco-palms above us, and already the countless thousands of sea birds, whose  &ldquo;rookery&rdquo; was on two small islets within the reef and near the village, were awake,  and filling the air with their clamour as they, like us, prepared to start off  for their day&rsquo;s fishing.</p>
<p>Our party consisted of&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Nalik, his wife and five dogs.</p>
<p>(2) Three young women, each with several dogs.</p>
<p>(3) Old Sru, chief of the district, with  numerous dogs.</p>
<p>(4) Two boys and three girls, who carried  baskets of food, crayfish nets, boar-spears, &amp;c. Large number of dogs, male  and female.</p>
<p>(5) The white man, to whom, as soon as he  appeared, the whole of the dogs immediately attached themselves.</p>
<p>(6) Small boy of ten, named Toka, the terror  of the village for his illimitable impudence and unsurpassed devilry. But as he  was a particular friend of the white man (and could not be prevented) he was  allowed to come. He had three dogs.</p>
<p>Before we started old Sru, Nalik, and myself  had some Hollands, two bottles of which were also placed in the care of Nalik&rsquo;s  wife. The &ldquo;devil,&rdquo; as Toka was called, mimicked us as we drank, smacked his  lips and rubbed one hand up and down his stomach. One of the big girls cuffed  him for being saucy. He retaliated by darting between her legs and throwing her  down upon the sand.</p>
<p>Presently we started, the women and children  going ahead, with the exception of the &ldquo;devil,&rdquo; who stuck close to me, and  carried my Snider in one hand and my double-barrel muzzle-loader in the other.</p>
<p>For the first two or three miles our way lay  along the hard, white beach, whose sands were covered everywhere by millions of  tiny, blue-backed, red-legged soldier crabs, moving to and fro in companies,  regiments, and divisions, hastening to burrow before the daylight revealed  their presence to their dreaded enemies&mdash;the golden-winged sand plovers and the  greedy sooty terns, who yet knew how to find them by the myriad small nodules  of sand they left to betray their hiding-place.</p>
<p>Oh, the sweet, sweet smell of the forest as it  is borne down from the mountains and carried seaward, to gladden, it may be,  the heart of some hard-worked, broken-spirited sailor, who, in a passing ship,  sees from aloft this fair, fair island with its smiling green of lear, and  soft, heaving valleys, above the long lines of curving beach, showing white and  bright in the morning sun! And, as you walk, the surf upon the reef for ever  calls and calls; sometimes loudly with a deep, resonant boom, but mostly with a  soft, faint murmur like the low-breathed sigh of a woman when she lies her  cheek upon her lover&rsquo;s breast and looks upward to his face with eyes aglow and  lips trembling for his kiss.</p>
<p>Far, far above a faint note. &nbsp;&rsquo;Tis but a snow-white tropic bird, suspended  in mid-air on motionless wing, his long scarlet pendrices almost invisible at  such a height. Presently, as he discerns you, he lets his aerial, slender form  sink and sink, without apparent motion, till he is within fifty feet, and then  he turns his graceful head from side to side, and inquiringly surveys you with  his full, soft black eye. For a moment or two he flutters his white wings  gently and noiselessly, and you can imagine you hear his timid heart-beats;  then, satisfied with his scrutiny, his fairy, graceful form floats upward into  space again, and is lost to view.</p>
<p>Leaving the beach and the sound of the droning  surf behind us we turned to the starboard hand, and struck through the narrow  strip of littoral towards the mountains. For the first mile or so our way was  through a grove of pandanus-palms, nearly every one of which was in full fruit;  on the branches were sitting hundreds of small sooty terns, who watched our  progress beneath with the calm indifference borne of the utter confidence of  immunity of danger from any human being.</p>
<p>Once through the sandy stretch on which the  pandanus loves to grow, we came to the outlier of the mountain lands&mdash;low,  gently undulating ridges, covered on both sides of the narrow track with dense  thickets of pineapples, every plant bearing a fruit half-matured, which, when  ripened, was never touched by the hand of man, for the whole island was, in  places, covered with thickets such as this, and the wild pig only revelled  among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They grow thickly,&rdquo; I said to Nalik.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, <i>tahina</i>* they grow thickly and  wild,&rdquo; he replied, with some inflection of sadness in his voice; &ldquo;long, long  ago, before my father&rsquo;s father lived, there was a great town here. That was  long before we of this land had ever seen a white man. And now we who are left  are but as dead leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Friend</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came it so to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I cannot tell. I only know  that once we of this land numbered many, many thousands, and now we are but  hundreds. Here, where we now walk, was once a great town of houses with stone  foundations; if ye cut away the <i>fara</i> (pineapples) thou wilt see the  lower stones lying in the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We pressed onward and upward into the deeper  forest, then turned downwards along a narrow path, carpeted thick with fallen  leaves, damp and soft to the foot, for the sun&rsquo;s rays never pierced through the  dense foliage overhead. And then we came out upon a fair, green sward with nine  stately coco-palms clustered, their branches drooping over the river of my  dreams, which lay before us with open, waiting bosom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>III</b></h3>
<p>Under the shade of the nine cocos we made our  camp, and old Sru and the women and children at once set to work to build a  &ldquo;house&rdquo; to protect us in case it rained during the nights. Very quickly was the  house built. The &ldquo;devil&rdquo; was sent up the cocos to lop off branches, which, as  they fell, were woven into thatch by the deft, eager hands of the women, who  were supervised by Sivi, Nalik&rsquo;s handsome wife, amid much chatter and laughter,  each one trying to outvie the other in speed, and all anxious to follow Nalik  and myself to the river.</p>
<p>The place was well chosen. For nearly a  hundred yards there was a clear stretch of water flowing between low, grassy  banks on which were growing a few scattered pandanus-palms&mdash;the screw pine. Half  a mile distant, a jagged, irregular mountain-peak raised high its emerald-hued  head in the clear sunshine, and from every lofty tree on both sides of the  stream there came the continuous call of the gentle wood-doves and the great  grey pigeons.</p>
<p>With Nalik and myself there came old Sru and  the imp Toka, who at once set to work and found us some small crayfish for  bait. Our rods were slender bamboos, about twelve feet long, with lines of the  same length made of twisted banana fibre as fine as silk, and equally as  strong. My hook was an ordinary flatted Kirby, about half the size of an  English whiting hook; Nalik preferred one of his own manufacture, made from a  strip of tortoise-shell, barbless and highly polished.</p>
<p>Taking our stand at a place where the  softly-flowing current eddied and curled around some black boulders of rock  whose surfaces were but a few inches above the clear, crystal stream, we  quickly baited our hooks and cast together, the old chief and the boy throwing  in some crushed-up crayfish shells at the same time. Before five seconds had  passed my brown-skinned comrade laughed as his thin line tautened out suddenly,  and in another instant he swung out a quivering streak of shining blue and  silver, and deftly caught it with his left hand; almost at the same moment my  rod was strained hard by a larger fish, which darted in towards the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First to thee, Nalik; but biggest to the <i>rebelli</i>&rdquo;*  cried old Sru, as with some difficulty&mdash;for my rod was too slight for such a  fish&mdash;I landed a lovely four-pounder on the grass.</p>
<p class="note"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </i>White man</p>
<p>Nalik laughed again, and before I had cleared  my hook from the jaw of my prize he had taken another and then a third,  catching each one in his left hand with incredible swiftness and throwing them  to the boy. The women and girls on the opposite bank laughed and chaffed me,  and urged me to hasten, or Nalik would catch five ere I landed another. But the <i>rebelli</i> took no heed of their merriment, for he was quite content to let  a few minutes go whilst he examined the glistening beauty which lay quivering  and gasping on the sward. It was nearly eighteen inches in length, its back  from the tip of the upper jaw to the tail a brilliant dark blue flecked with  tiny specks of red, the sides a burnished silver, changing, as the belly was  reached, to a glistening white. The pectoral and lower fins were a pale blue,  flecked with somewhat larger spots of brighter red than those on the back, and  the tail showed the same colouring. In shape it was much like a grayling,  particularly about the head; and altogether a more beautiful fresh-water fish I  have never seen.</p>
<p>We fished for an hour or more, and caught  three or four dozen of this particular fish as well as eight or nine  dark-scaled, stodgy bream, which haunted the centre of the pool where the water  was deep. Then as the sun grew fiercer they ceased to bite, and we ceased to  tempt them; so we lay down and rested and smoked, whilst the women and children  made a ground-oven and prepared some of the fish for cooking. Putting aside the  largest&mdash;which was reserved for the old chief and myself&mdash;Nalik&rsquo;s kindly,  gentle-voiced wife, watched the children roll each fish up in a wrapper of  green coconut leaf and lay them carefully upon the glowing bed of stones in the  oven, together with some scores of long, slender green bananas, to serve as a  vegetable in place of taro or yams, which would take a much longer time to  cook. On the top of all was placed the largest fish, and then the entire oven  was rapidly covered up with wild banana leaves in the shape of a mound.</p>
<p>The moment Nalik and I had laid down our rods,  and whilst the oven was being prepared, Toka and the two other boys sprang into  the water at one end of the pool and began to disturb the bottom with their  feet. The young girls and women, each carrying a small finely-meshed scoop-net,  joined them, and in a few minutes they had filled a basket with crayfish, some  of which were ten inches in length, and weighed over a pound, their tails  especially being very large and fleshy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we boil or bake them?&rdquo; asked Nalik as  the basketful was brought up to me for examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boil them,&rdquo; I replied, for I had brought with  me several pounds of coarse salt taken from our wrecked ship&rsquo;s harness cask and  carefully dried in the sun, and a boiled crayfish or crab is better than one  baked&mdash;and spoiled.</p>
<p>A tall, graceful girl, named Seia, came  forward with a large wooden bowl, nearly eighteen inches in diameter at the  top, and two feet in depth&mdash;no light weight even to lift, for at its rim it was  over an inch thick. Placing it on the ground in front of Sru and myself, she  motioned to the other girls to bring water. They brought her about two gallons  in buckets made of the looped-up leaves of the taro plant, and poured it into  the vessel; then Nalik and old Sru, with rough tongs formed of the midrib of a  coconut branch, whipped up eight or ten large red-hot stones from a fire near  by, and dropped them into the vessel, the water in which at once began to boil  and send up a volume of steam as Seia tipped the entire basketful of crustacean  delicacies into the bowl, together with some handfuls of salt. Then a  closely-woven mat was placed over the top and tied round it so as to keep in  the heat&mdash;that is the way they boil food in the South Seas with a wooden pot!</p>
<p>From time to time during the next quarter of  an hour more red-hot stones were dropped into the bowl until old Sru pronounced  the contents to be <i>tunua</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, well and truly cooked, and then  whilst the now bright red crayfish were laid out to cool upon platters of green  woven coconut leaf, the first oven of fish and bananas was opened.</p>
<p>What a delightful meal it was! The fat,  luscious fish, cooked in their own juices, each one deftly ridden of its  compact coating of silvery scales by the quick hands of the women, and then  turned out hot and smoking upon a platter of leaf, with half a dozen green,  baked bananas for bread! Such fish, and so cooked, surely fall to the lot of  few. Your City professional diner who loves to instruct us in the daily papers  about &ldquo;how to dine&rdquo; cannot know anything about the real enjoyment of eating. He  is <i>blas&eacute;</i> he regulates his stomach to his costume and to the season, and  he eats as fashion dictates he should eat, and fills his long-suffering stomach  with nickety, tin-pot, poisonous &ldquo;delicacies&rdquo; which he believes are excellent  because they are expensive and are prepared by a <i>chef</i> whose income is  ten times as much as his own.</p>
<p>So we ate our fish and bananas, and then  followed on with the crayfish, the women and children shelling them for us as  fast as we could eat, the largest and fittest being placed before the old chief  and the white man. And then for dessert we had a basket of red-ripe wild  mangoes, with a great smooth-leaved pineapple as big as a big man&rsquo;s head, and  showing red and green and yellow, and smelling fresh and sweet with the rain of  the previous night. Near by where we sat was a pile of freshly-husked young  coconuts, which a smiling-faced young girl opened for us as we wanted a drink,  carefully pouring out upon the ground all the liquid that remained after Sru  and myself had drank, and then putting the empty shells, with their delicate  lining of alabaster flesh, into the fire to be consumed, for no one not of  chiefly rank must partake even of that which is cast aside by a chief or his  guests.</p>
<p>Our first meal of the day finished, we&mdash;that  is, Nalik, Sru, and myself&mdash;lay down under the shade or the newly-built thatched  roof and smoked our pipes in content, whilst the women and children, attended  by the dogs, bathed in the deepest part of the pool, shouting, laughing, and  splashing and diving till they were tired. The dogs, mongrel as they were,  enjoyed the fun as much as their masters, biting and worrying each other  playfully as they swam round and round, and then crawling out upon the bank,  they ran to and fro upon the grassy sward till they too were glad to rest under  the shade of the clump of coco-palms.</p>
<p>In the afternoon&mdash;leaving the rest of our party  to amuse themselves by catching crayfish and to make traps for wild pigs&mdash;Sru,  Nalik, Toka, and myself set out towards <i>the</i> pool at the head of the  river, where, I was assured, we were sure to get a pig or two by nightfall. The  dogs evidently were equally as certain of this as Nalik and Sru, for the moment  they saw the two men pick up their heavy hunting-spears they sprang to their  feet and began howling and yelping in concert till they were beaten into  silence by the women. I brought with me a short Snider carbine&mdash;the best and  handiest weapon to stop a wild pig at a short range&mdash;and a double-barrelled  muzzle-loading shot-gun. The latter I gave to the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; to carry, and  promised him that he should fire at least five shots from it at pigeons or  mountain fowl before we returned to the village.</p>
<p>Following a narrow footpath which led along  the right bank of the stream, we struck directly into the heart of the mountain  forest, and in a few minutes the voices, shouts, and laughter of our companions  sounded as if they were miles and miles away. Now and then as we got deeper  into the dark, cool shade caused by the leafed dome above, we heard the shrill  cry of the long-legged mountain cock&mdash;a cry which I can only describe as an  attempt at the ordinary barnyard rooster&rsquo;s &ldquo;cock-a-doodle-do&rdquo; combined with the  scream of a cat when its tail is trodden upon by a heavy-booted foot. Here in  these silent, darkened aisles of the forest it sounded weird and uncanny in the  extreme, and aroused an intense desire to knock the creature over; but I  forebore to fire, although we once had a view of a fine bird, attended by a hen  and chicks, scurrying across the leaf-strewn ground not fifty feet away.  Everywhere around us the great grey pigeons were sounding their booming notes  from the branches overhead, but of these too we took no heed, for a shot would  have alarmed every wild pig within a mile of us.</p>
<p>An hour&rsquo;s march brought us to the crest of a  spur covered with a species of white cedar, whose branches were literally  swarming with doves and pigeons, feeding upon small, sweet-scented berries  about the size of English haws. Here we rested awhile, the dogs behaving  splendidly by lying down quietly and scarcely moving as they watched me taking  off my boots and putting on a pair of cinnet (coir fibre) sandals. Just beneath  us was a deep canyon, at the bottom of which, so Nalik said, was a tiny rivulet  which ran through banks covered with wild yams and <i>ti</i> plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be nothing so sweet to the mouth of the  mountain pig as the thick roots of the <i>ti</i>,&rdquo; said Nalik to me in a low  voice. &ldquo;They come here to root them up at this time of the year, before the  wild yams are well grown, and the <i>ti</i> both fattens and sweetens. Let us  start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a sign from Sru, Nalilc and the boy Toka,  followed by the dogs, went off towards the head of the canyon, so as to drive  down to the old man and myself any pigs which might be feeding above, whilst we  slipped quietly down the side of the spur to the bank of the rivulet. Sru  carried my gun (which I had loaded with ball) as well as his spear. I had my  Snider.</p>
<p>We had not long to wait, for presently we  heard the dogs give cry, and the silence of the forest was broken by the  demoniac yells of Nalik and the &ldquo;devil,&rdquo; who had started a party of two boars  and half a dozen sows with their half-grown progeny, which were lying down  around the buttressed sides of a great tika-tree. They (the pigs) came down the  side of the rivulet with a tremendous rush, right on top of us in fact. I fired  at the leader&mdash;a great yellow, razorbacked boar with enormous tusks&mdash;missed him,  but hit a young sow who was running on his port side. Sru, with truer aim,  fired both barrels of his gun in quick succession, and the second boar dropped  with a bullet through both shoulders, and a dear little black and yellow  striped four-months&rsquo;-old porker went under to the other barrel with a broken  spine. Then in another three or four minutes we were kicking and &ldquo;belting&rdquo;  about half of the dogs, who, maddened by the smell of blood from the wounded  animals, sprang upon them and tried to tear them to pieces; the rest of the  pack (Heaven save the term!) had followed the flying swine down the canyon;  they turned up at the camp some three or four hours later with bloodied jaws  and gorged to distension.</p>
<p>The boar which Sru had shot was lean enough in  all conscience, but the young sow and the four-months&rsquo;-old porker were as  round-bodied as barrels, and as fat as only pigs can be fat. After  disembowelling them, we hoisted the carcasses up under the branch of a tree out  of the reach of the dogs, and sent Toka back to the camp to tell the women to  come and carry them away.</p>
<p>Then, as we had still another hour or two of  daylight, and I longed to see the deep, deep pool at the head of the river,  even if it were but for a few moments, the old chief Nalik and I started off.</p>
<p>It lay before us with many, many bars of  golden sunlight striking down through the trees and trying to penetrate its  calm, placid bosom with their warm, loving rays. Far below the sound of the  waterfall sung to the dying day, and, as we listened, there came to us the  dulled, distant murmur of the combing breakers upon the reef five miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a fair, good place this, is it not?&rdquo;  whispered Nalik, as he sat beside me&mdash;&ldquo;a fair, good place, though it be haunted  by the spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, a fair, sweet place indeed,&rdquo; I answered,  &ldquo;and this pool and the river below shall for ever be in my dreams when I am far  away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b>&ldquo;Old Mary&rdquo;</b><a name="OldMary"></a></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>I</b></h3>
<p>Early one morning, just as the trade wind began to lift the white  mountain mist which enveloped the dark valleys and mountain slopes of the  island, Denison, the supercargo of the trading schooner <i>Palestine</i>, put  off from her side and was pulled ashore to the house of the one white trader.  The man&rsquo;s name was Randle, and as he heard the supercargo&rsquo;s footstep he came to  the door and bade him good morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Randle?&rdquo; said the young man, shaking hands with the  quiet-voiced, white-haired old trader, and following him inside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for  a day&rsquo;s shooting while I have the chance. Can you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randle shook his head. &ldquo;Would like to, but can&rsquo;t spare the time  to-day; but Harry and the girls will be delighted to go with you. Wait a  minute, and have a cup of coffee first. They&rsquo;ll be here presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denison put down his gun and took a seat in the cool,  comfortable-looking sitting-room, and in a few minutes Hester and Kate Randle  and their brother came in. The two girls were both over twenty years of age.  Hester, the elder, was remarkably handsome, and much resembled her father in  voice and manner. Kate was of much smaller build, full of vivacity, and her  big, merry brown eyes matched the dimples on her soft, sun-tanned cheeks.  Harry, who was Randle&rsquo;s youngest child, was a heavily-built, somewhat  sullen-faced youth of eighteen, and the native blood in his veins showed much  more strongly than it did with his sisters. They were all pleased to see the  supercargo, and at once set about making preparations, Harry getting their guns  ready and the two girls packing a basket with cold food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get any amount of pigeons about two miles from here,&rdquo; said  the old trader, &ldquo;and very likely a pig or two. The girls know the way, and if  two of you take the right branch of the river and two the left you&rsquo;ll have some  fine sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the elder girl, in her pretty, halting English, as  she picked up her gun, &ldquo;don&rsquo; you think Mr. Denison would like to see ol&rsquo; Mary?  We hav&rsquo; been tell him so much about her. Don&rsquo; you think we might stop there and  let Mr. Denison have some talk with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, my girl. Yes; go and see the poor old thing. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll  be delighted. You&rsquo;ll like her, Mr. Denison. She&rsquo;s as fine an old woman as ever  breathed. But don&rsquo;t take that basket of food with you, Kate. She&rsquo;d feel awfully  insulted if you did not eat in her house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls obeyed, much to their brother&rsquo;s satisfaction, inasmuch  as the basket was rather heavy, and also awkward to carry through the mountain  forest. In a few minutes the four started, and Hester, as she stepped out  beside Denison, said that she was glad he was visiting old Mary. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;she hav&rsquo; not good eyesight now, and so she cannot now come an&rsquo; see us as  she do plenty times before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I shall see her,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;she must be a  good old soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; broke in Kate, &ldquo;she <i>is</i> good and brave, an&rsquo; we  all love her. Every one <i>mus</i>&rsquo; love her. She hav&rsquo; known us since we were  born, and when our mother died in Samoa ten years ago old Mary was jus&rsquo; like a  second mother to us. An&rsquo; my father tried so hard to get her to come and live  with us; but no, she would not, not even fo&rsquo; us. So she went back to her house  in the mountain, because she says she wants to die there. Ah, you will like her&hellip;  and she will tell you how she saved the ship when her husband was killed, and  about many, many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Two hours later Denison and his friends emerged out upon  cultivated ground at the foot of the mountain, on which stood three or four  native houses, all neatly enclosed by low stone walls formed of coral slabs. In  front of the village a crystal stream poured swiftly and noisily over its rocky  bed on its way seaward, and on each thickly wooded bank the stately boles of  some scores of graceful coco-palms rose high above the surrounding foliage.  Except for the hum of the brawling stream and the cries of birds, the silence  was unbroken, and only two or three small children, who were playing under the  shade of a breadfruit-tree, were visible. But these, as they heard the sound of  the visitors&rsquo; voices, came towards them shouting out to their elders within the  huts that &ldquo;four white people with guns&rdquo; had come. In a moment some grown people  of both sexes came out and shook hands with the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mary&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said Hester to Denison, pointing out the  largest; &ldquo;let us go there at once. Ah, see, there she is at the door waiting  for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come inside,&rdquo; cried the old woman in a firm yet pleasant  voice, and Denison, looking to the right, saw that &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; in spite of her  years and blindness, was still robust and active-looking. She was dressed in a  blue print gown and blouse, and her grey hair was neatly dressed in the island  fashion. In her smooth, brown right hand she grasped the handle of a polished  walking-stick, her left arm she held across her bosom&mdash;the hand was missing from  the wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo; she said in clear English, as, giving her  stick to Kate Randle, she held out her hand to the supercargo. &ldquo;I am so glad  that you have come to see me. You are Mr. Denison, I know. Is Captain Packenham  quite well? Come, Kitty, see to your friend. There, that cane lounge is the  most comfortable. Harry, please shoot a couple of chickens at once, and then  tell my people to get some taro, and make an oven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is just like you, Mary,&rdquo; said Kate, laughing, &ldquo;before we  have spoken three words to you you begin cooking things for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman turned her sunburnt face towards the girl and shook  her stick warningly, and said in the native tongue&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me to rule in mine own house, saucy,&rdquo; and then Denison had  an effort to restrain his gravity as Mary, unaware that he had a very fair  knowledge of the dialect in which she spoke, asked the two girls if either of  them had thought of him as a husband. Kate put her hand over Mary&rsquo;s mouth and  whispered to her to cease. She drew the girl to her and hugged her.</p>
<p>Whilst the meal was being prepared Denison was studying the house  and its contents. Exteriorly the place bore no difference to the usual native  house, but within it was plainly but yet comfortably furnished in European  fashion, and the tables, chairs, and sideboard had evidently been a portion of  a ship&rsquo;s cabin fittings. From the sitting-room&mdash;the floor of which was covered  by white China matting&mdash;he could see a bedroom opposite, a bed with snowy white  mosquito curtains, and two mahogany chairs draped with old-fashioned  antimacassars. The sight of these simple furnishings first made him smile, then  sigh&mdash;he had not seen such things since he had left his own home nearly six  years before. Hung upon the walls of the sitting-room were half a dozen old and  faded engravings, and on a side-table were a sextant and chronometer case, each  containing instruments so clumsy and obsolete that a modern seaman would have  looked upon them as veritable curiosities.</p>
<p>From the surroundings within the room Denison&rsquo;s eyes wandered to  the placid beauty of the scene without, where the plumes of the coco-palms  overhanging the swift waters of the tiny stream scarce stirred to the light air  that blew softly up the valley from the sea, and when they did move narrow  shafts of light from the now high-mounted sun would glint and shine through  upon the pale green foliage of the scrub beneath. Then once again his attention  was directed to their hostess, who was now talking quietly to the two Randle  girls, her calm, peaceful features seeming to him to derive an added but yet  consistent dignity from the harmonies of Nature around her.</p>
<p>What was the story of her infancy? he wondered. That she did not  know it herself he had been told by old Randle, who yet knew more of her  history and the tragedy of her later life than any one else. Both young  Denison, the supercargo of five-and-twenty, and Randle, the grizzled wanderer  and veteran of sixty-five, had known many tragedies during their career in the  Pacific; but the story of this half-blind, crippled old woman, when he learnt  it in full, appealed strongly to the younger man, and was never forgotten in  his after life.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>They had had a merry midday meal, during which Mary Eury&mdash;for that  was her name&mdash;promised Denison that she would tell him all about herself after  he and the Randles came back from shooting, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; she added, with her soft,  tremulous laugh, &ldquo;only on one condition, Mr. Denison&mdash;only on one condition. You  must bring Captain Packenham to see me before the <i>Palestine</i> sails. I am  an old woman now, and would like to see him. I knew him many years ago when he  was a lad of nineteen. Ah, it is so long ago! That was in Samoa. Has he never  spoken of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often, Mrs. Eury&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Mrs. Eury, Mr. Denison. Call me &lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; as do these  dear friends of mine. &lsquo;Mary&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;old&rsquo; Mary if you like. Every one who knew me and  my dear husband in those far, far back days used to call me &lsquo;Mary&rsquo; and my  husband &lsquo;Bob Eury&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Mrs. Eury&rsquo; and &lsquo;Captain Eury.&rsquo; And now, so many,  many years have gone&hellip; and now I am &lsquo;Old Mary&rsquo;&hellip; and I think I like it better  than Mrs. Eury. And so Captain Packenham has not forgotten me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denison hastened to explain. &ldquo;Indeed he has not. He remembers you  very well, and would have come with me, but he is putting the schooner on the  beach to-day to clean her. And I am sure he will be delighted to come and see  you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he must. Surely every English and American in the South  Seas should come and see me; for my husband was ever a good friend to every  sailor that ever sailed in the island trade&mdash;from Fiji to the Bonins. There now,  I won&rsquo;t chatter any more, or else you will be too frightened to come back to  such a garrulous old creature. Ah, if God had but spared to me my eyesight I  should come with you into the mountains. I love the solitude, and the sweet  call of the pigeons, and the sound of the waterfall at the side of Taomaunga.  And I know every inch of the country, and blind as I am, I could yet find my  way along the mountain-side. Kate, and you, Harry, do not keep Mr. Denison out  too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By sunset the shooting party had returned, and after a bathe in  the cool waters of the mountain stream Denison returned to the house. Kate  Handle and her sister, assisted by some native women, were plucking pigeons for  the evening meal. Harry was lying down on the broad of his back on the grassy  sward with closed eyes, smoking, and their hostess was sitting on a wide cane  bench outside the house. She heard the young man&rsquo;s footstep, and beckoned him  to seat himself beside her. And then she told him her story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>II</b></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I was born&mdash;for, as I daresay Randle has told  you, I was only five years of age when I was picked up at sea in a boat, the  only other occupant of which was a Swedish seaman. The vessel which rescued us  was one of the transports used for conveying convicts to New South Wales, and  was named the <i>Britannia</i>, but when she sighted the boat she was on a  voyage to Tahiti in the Society Islands. I imagine this was sometime about  1805, so I must now be about seventy years of age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Swedish sailor told the captain of the <i>Britannia</i> that  he and I were the only survivors of a party of six&mdash;among whom were my father  and mother&mdash;belonging to a small London barque named the <i>Winifred</i>, She  was employed in the trade between China and Valparaiso, and my father was owner  as well as captain. On the voyage from Canton, and when within fifty miles of  Tahiti, and in sight of land, she took fire, and the Chinese crew, when they  saw that there was no hope of the ship being saved, seized the longboat, which  had been prepared, and was well provisioned, and made off, although the  cowardly creatures knew that the second boat was barely seaworthy. My  father&mdash;whose name the Swede did not know&mdash;implored them to return, and at least  take my mother and myself and an officer to navigate their boat to land. But  they refused to listen to his pleadings, and rowed off. The second boat was  hurriedly provisioned by my father and his officers, and they, with my mother  and myself and the Swede&mdash;all the Europeans on board&mdash;left the burning ship at  sundown. A course was steered for the eastern shore of Tahiti, which, although  the wind was right ahead, we hoped to reach on the evening of the following  day. But within a few hours after leaving the barque the trade wind died away,  and fierce, heavy squalls burst from the westward upon the boat, which was only  kept afloat by constant bailing. About dawn the sea had become so dangerous,  and the wind had so increased in violence, that an attempt was made to put out  a sea-anchor. Whilst this was being done a heavy sea struck the boat and  capsized her. The night was pitchy dark, and when the Swede&mdash;who was a good  swimmer&mdash;came to the surface he could neither see nor hear any of the others,  though he shouted loudly. But at the same moment, as his foot touched the line  to which the sea anchor was bent, he heard the mate&rsquo;s voice calling for  assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have the child,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Be quick, for I&rsquo;m done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another minute the brave fellow had taken me from him; then  the poor mate sank, never to rise again. Whether I was alive or dead my rescuer  could not tell, but being a man of great physical strength, he not only kept me  above water with one hand, but succeeded in reaching first the sea-anchor-four  oars lashed together&mdash;and then the boat, which had been righted by another sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How this brave man kept me alive in such a terrible situation I  do not know. By sunrise the wind had died away, the sea had gone down, and he  was able to free the boat of water. In the stern-sheet locker he found one  single tin of preserved potatoes, which had been jammed into a corner when the  boat capsized&mdash;all the rest of the provisions, with the water-breakers as well,  were lost. On this tin of potatoes we lived&mdash;so he told the master of the <i>Britannia</i>&mdash;for  five days, constantly in sight of the land around which we were drifting,  sometimes coming to within a distance of thirty miles of it. All this time, by  God&rsquo;s providence, we had frequent heavy rain squalls, and the potato tin, which  was about eighteen inches square, and was perfectly water-tight, proved our  salvation, for the potatoes were so very salt that we would have perished of  thirst had we been unable to save water. Ohlsen cut down one of his high  sea-boots, and into this he would put two handfuls of the dried potatoes, and  then fill it up with water. It made a good sustaining food after it had been  softened by the water and kneaded into a pulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour before dawn, on the sixth day, Ohlsen, who was lying on  the bottom boards of the boat, was awakened by hearing me crying for my mother.  The poor fellow, who had stripped off his woollen shirt to protect my little  body from the cold, at once sat up and tried to comfort me. The sea was as  smooth as glass, and only a light air was blowing. Drawing me to his bare  chest&mdash;for I was chilled with the keen morning air&mdash;he was about to lie down  again, when he heard the creaking of blocks and then a voice say, &lsquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rsquo;  and there, quite near us, was a large ship! In a moment he sprang to his feet,  and hailed with all his strength; he was at once answered, the ship was brought  to the wind, a boat lowered, and in less than a quarter of an hour we were on  board the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that dear old ship I remained for five years or more, for the  captain had his wife on board, and although she had two young children of her  own, she cared for and loved me as if I had been her own daughter. Most of this  time was spent among the Pacific Islands, and then there came to me another  tragedy, of one of which I have a most vivid remembrance, for I was quite  eleven years old at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Britannia</i>, like many South Seamen of those times, was  a letter of marque, and carried nine guns, for although we were, I think, at  peace with Spain, we were at war with France, and there were plenty of French  privateers cruising on the South American coast, with whom our ships were  frequently engaged. But none had ever been seen so far eastward as the  Galapagos Islands, and so we one day sailed without fear into a small bay on  the north-west side of Charles Island to wood and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the following morning the captain, whose name was Rossiter,  ordered my old friend Ohlsen, who was now gunner on the <i>Britannia</i>, to  take four hands and endeavour to capture some of the huge land tortoises which  abound on the islands of the group. I was allowed to go with them. Little did I  think I should never again see his kindly face when I took my seat in the boat  and was rowed ashore. Besides Ohlsen and myself, there were two English seamen,  a negro named King and a Tahitian native. The youngest of the English sailors  was named Robert Eury; he was about twenty-two years of age, and a great  favourite of the captain who knew his family in Dorset, England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hauled the boat up on a small sandy beach, and then started  off into the country, and by noon we had caught three large tortoises which we  found feeding on cactus plants. Then, as we were resting and eating, we  suddenly heard the report of a heavy gun, and then another and another. We  clambered up the side of a rugged hill, from the summit of which we could see  the harbour, a mile distant, and there was the <i>Britannia</i> lying at anchor,  and being attacked by two vessels! As we watched the fight we saw one of the  strange ships, which were both under sail, fire a broadside at our vessel, and  the second, putting about, did the same. These two broadsides, we afterwards  heard, were terribly disastrous, for the captain and three men were killed, and  nine wounded. The crew, however, under the mate, still continued to work her  guns with the utmost bravery and refused to surrender. Then a lucky shot from  one of her 9-pounders disabled the rudder of the largest Frenchmen, which,  fearing to anchor so near to such a determined enemy, at once lowered her boats  and began to tow out, followed by her consort. At the entrance to the bay,  however, the smaller of the two again brought-to and began firing at our poor  ship with a 24-pounder, or other long-range gun, and every shot struck. It was  then that the mate and his crew, enraged at the death of the captain, and  finding that the ship was likely to be pounded to pieces, determined to get  under weigh and come to close quarters with the enemy, for the <i>Britannia</i> was a wonderfully fast ship, and carried a crew of fifty-seven men. But first  of all he sent ashore Mrs. Rossiter, her two children, a coloured steward, and  all the money and other valuables in case he should be worsted. His name was  Skinner, and he was a man of the most undaunted resolution, and had at one time  commanded a London privateer called the <i>Lucy</i>, which had made so many  captures that Skinner was quite a famous man. But his intemperate habits caused  him to lose his command, and he had had to ship on the <i>Britannia</i> as  chief mate. He was, however, a great favourite with the men, who now urged him  to lead them on and avenge the loss of the captain; so the moment the boat  returned from landing Mrs. Rossiter he slipped his cable, and stood out to meet  the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, from the hill, watched all this with the greatest interest  and excitement, and then Ohlsen turned to the others and said, &lsquo;Let us get back  to the boat at once. The captain has got under weigh to chase those fellows,  and we should be with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we descended to the beach, where we met the poor lady and her  children, and heard that her husband was dead. She begged Ohlsen not to leave  her, but he said his duty lay with his shipmates; then she besought him to at  least leave Robert Eury with her, as she was terrified at the idea of having to  spend the night on such a wild island with no one but the coloured steward to  protect her and her children. At this time&mdash;although we could not see them&mdash;we  knew the ships were heavily engaged, for the roar of the cannon was continuous.  So, much to his anger, young Eury was bidden to remain with the captain&rsquo;s wife,  her son aged twelve, her daughter Ann, who was three years younger, the  coloured steward, and myself. Then, bidding us goodbye, Ohlsen and his three  men went off in the boat, and were soon out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young as he was, Robert Eury had good sense and judgment. He was  angry at Mr. Skinner venturing out to attack such well-armed vessels with our  poor 9-pounders, and although he had been most anxious to join his shipmates,  he was, he afterwards told me, pretty sure that the <i>Britannia</i> would have  to strike or be sunk. The first thing he did, however, was to make all of our  party comfortable. At the head of the bay there was an empty house, which had  been built by the crews of the whaleships frequenting the Galapagos as a sort  of rest-house for the men sent to catch tortoises. To this place he took us,  and set the steward to work to get us something to eat, for Mr. Skinner had  sent provisions and wine ashore. Then he took the ship&rsquo;s money, which amounted  to about thirteen hundred pounds, and buried it a little distance away from the  house. I helped him, and when the bags were safely covered up he turned to me  with a smile lighting up his brown face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There, Molly. That&rsquo;s done, and if Mr. Skinner has to strike, and  the Frenchmen come here, they&rsquo;ll get nothing but ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time it was well on towards the afternoon, and we only  heard a cannon shot now and then. Then the sound of the firing ceased  altogether. We got back to the house and waited&mdash;we knew not for what. Poor Mrs.  Rossiter, who was a very big, stout woman, had sobbed herself into a state of  exhaustion, but she tried to brace herself up when she saw us, and when Robert  Eury told her that he had buried the money, she thanked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Try and save it for my children, Robert I fear I shall not be  long with them. And if I am taken away suddenly I want you to bear witness that  it was my husband&rsquo;s wish, and is mine now, that Mary here is to share alike  with my son Fred and my daughter Ann. Would to God I had means here to write.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert tried to comfort her with the assurance that all would be  well, when as he spoke we saw a sight at which I, girl of twelve as I was, was  struck with terror&mdash;the two French ships appeared round the headland with the <i>Britannia</i> following with French colours at her peak. The three came in together very  slowly, and then dropped anchor within a cable&rsquo;s length of the beach. The  captain&rsquo;s wife looked at them wildly for a moment, and then fell forward on her  face. She died that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two French captains treated us very kindly, and they told  Robert, who spoke French well, that Mr. Skinner had made a most determined  attempt to board the larger of the two vessels, but was killed by a  musket-shot, and that only after thirty of the <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> crew had been  killed and wounded, and the ship herself was but little more than a wreck, did  Ohlsen, who was himself terribly wounded by a splinter in the side, haul down  his flag. Then the elder of the two Frenchmen asked Robert which was the child  named &lsquo;Marie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the child, sir,&rsquo; said Eury, pointing to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then let her come with me and see the gunner of our prize,&rsquo; said  he; &lsquo;he is dying, and has asked to see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was taken on board the Britannia, over her bloodstained decks,  and into the main cabin, where poor Ohlsen was lying breathing his last. His  face lit up when he saw me, and he drew me to his bosom just as he had done  years before in the open boat off Tahiti. I stayed with him till the last, then  one of the French privateer officers led me away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning Mrs. Rossiter was buried; the French captains  allowing some of the surviving members of the crew of the <i>Britannia</i> to  carry her body to her grave. There was a young Spanish woman&mdash;the wife of the  older captain&mdash;on board the larger of the privateers, and she took care of us  three children. I cannot remember her name, but I do remember that she was a  very beautiful woman and very kind to us, and told us through an interpreter  that we should be well cared for, and some day go home to England; and when she  learned my own particular story she took me in her arms, kissed, and made much  of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About noon the crew of the <i>Britannia</i> were ranged on deck,  and the elder of the two French captains called on Robert Eury to step out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This man here,&rsquo; he said in English, indicating the coloured  steward, tells me that you have buried some money belonging to the prize. Where  is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot tell you,&rsquo; replied Robert; &lsquo;the captain&rsquo;s wife told me  it belonged to her children and to the little girl Mary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Frenchman laughed. &lsquo;It belongs to us now; it is prize money,  my good boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eury looked at him steadily, but made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said the captain impatiently, &lsquo;where is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The younger of the captains laughed savagely, and stepped up to  him, pistol in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I give you ten seconds to tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Five will do, monsieur,&rsquo; replied Robert, in French, &lsquo;and then  you will be losing five seconds of your time. I shall not tell you. But I  should like to say goodbye to my dead captain&rsquo;s children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The young Frenchmen&rsquo;s face purpled with fury. &lsquo;Very well then,  you fool!&rsquo; and he raised his pistol to murder the young man, when the older  captain seized his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shame, Pellatier, shame! Would you kill such a brave man in cold  blood? Let us be satisfied with getting such a good ship. Surely you would not  shoot him for the sake of a few hundred dollars?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There may be thousands. How can we tell?&rsquo; replied Pellatier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert laughed, and then raised his hand in salute to the elder  captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Captain Pellatier is right, sir. Madame Melville told me that  there were thirteen hundred pounds in the bags which I have buried. And on  certain conditions I will tell you where to find it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Name them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The money is fair prize money. That I admit. But you will never  see it, unless you agree to my conditions, and pledge me your word of honour to  observe them honourably. I am not afraid to die, gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are a bold fellow, and ought to have been a Frenchman&mdash;but be  quick, name the conditions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Half of the money to be given to these orphan children, whose  pitiable condition should appeal to you. And promise me on your honour as men  that you will land them at Valparaiso, or some other civilised place, from  where they may reach England. If you will not make this promise, you can shoot  me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what of yourself?&rsquo; said Pellatier, who was a little dark man  with very ugly monkey-like features; &lsquo;you would be the guardian of this money,  no doubt, my clever fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The insulting manner in which he spoke exasperated Eury beyond  endurance, and he made as if he would strike the man; but he stopped suddenly,  and looking contemptuously at the Frenchman uttered the one word&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Babouin!</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It nearly cost him his life, for Pellatier, stung to fury by the  loud laughter of his fellow-captain, again levelled his pistol at the young  man, and again the older captain seized his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Heaven, you shall not harm him!&rsquo; he cried, amid a murmur of  applause from the crew. Then addressing Eury he said. I give you my promise.  The children and yourself are under my protection, and when we reach Valparaiso  I will put you all on shore.&rsquo; Then he ordered one of his officers to escort  Robert ashore and get the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eury thanked him quietly, and then he turned to Pellatier, and  said he was sorry he used an offensive word to him; but Pellatier received his  apology with a scowl, and turned away. In half an hour Eury returned with the  officer, carrying the money. It was counted and divided, and it was easy to see  that Dupuis, the elder captain, was very pleased when the young man asked him  to take charge of the half of the money belonging to the Rossiter children and  myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three ships sailed in company for South America a week later.  I remained on board the <i>Britannia</i> together with Robert Eury and six  others of her original crew, the Rossiter children being taken by the Spanish  lady on board the larger of the privateers, the second lieutenant of which,  with about twenty men, were drafted to the prize. After keeping in close  company for four or five days we lost sight of the privateers, much to the  annoyance of our captain, who was a very indifferent navigator, as he soon  showed by altering his course to E. by S. so as to pick up the coast of South  America as soon as possible. This was a most fortunate thing for us, for at  daylight on the following morning two sail were seen, not five miles distant,  and to our intense delight proved to be English letters of marque&mdash;the barque <i>Centurion</i> of Bristol and the barque <i>Gratitude</i> of London. They at once closed in  upon and engaged us, and although the Frenchmen made a good fight, they had to  strike after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s engagement, for the <i>Centurion</i> was a  very heavily armed ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her captain was a very old man named Richard Glass. He came on  board the <i>Britannia</i> and spoke very good-humouredly to the French  lieutenant, for on neither side had any one been killed, and he saw that the <i>Britannia</i> was a fine ship. He told the Frenchmen to take the longboat, and as much  provisions and water as they liked, and make for the coast, which was less than  seventy miles distant. This was soon done, and our former captors parted from  us very good friends, every one of them coming up and shaking hands with Robert  Eury and calling him <i>bon camarade</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Glass put his own chief officer in charge of the <i>Britannia</i> (with Robert as his mate) and ordered him to proceed to Port Jackson and await  the arrival there of the <i>Centurion</i> and her consort. We arrived at our  destination safely, and as soon as my story was known many kind people wanted  to adopt me; but the agent of the <i>Britannia</i> took me to his own home,  where I lived for many happy years as a member of his family. Robert Eury was  then appointed mate of a vessel in the China trade, but I saw him every year.  Then when I was seventeen years of age he asked me to marry him, and I did so  gladly, for he was always present in my thoughts when he was away, and I knew  he loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>III</b></h3>
<p>&ldquo;My husband invested his savings in a small schooner, which he  named the <i>Taunton</i> and within a month of our marriage we were at sea,  bound on a trading voyage to Tahiti and the Paumotus. This first venture proved  very successful, so did the two following voyages; and then, as he determined  to found a business of his own in the South Seas, he bought a large piece of  land on this island from the natives, with whom he was on very friendly terms.  His reasons for choosing this particular island were, firstly, because of its  excellent situation&mdash;midway between Port Jackson and the Spanish settlements on  the South American coast, which were good markets; secondly, because great  numbers of the American whaling ships would make it a place of call to refresh  if there was a reputable white man living on the island; and thirdly, because  he intended to go into sperm whaling himself, for it was an immensely  profitable business, and he could, if he wished, sell the oil to the American  ships instead of taking it to Port Jackson. The natives here in those days were  a very wild set, but they really had a great friendship and respect for my  husband; and when they learnt that he intended to settle among them permanently  they were delighted beyond measure. They at once set to work and built us a  house, and the chief and my husband exchanged names in the usual manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first child was born on the island whilst my husband was away  on a voyage to Port Jackson, and, indeed, of my four children three were born  here. When Robert returned in the <i>Taunton</i> he brought with him a cargo of  European stores and comforts for our new home, and in a few months we were  fairly settled down. From the first American whaleships that visited us he  bought two fine whaleboats and all the necessary gear, and then later on  engaged one of the best whalemen in the South Seas to superintend the business.  In the first season we killed no less than six sperm whales, and could have  taken more, but were short of barrels. The whaling station was at the end of  the south point of the harbour, and when a whale was towed in to be cut in and  tried out the place presented a scene of great activity and bustle, for we had  quite two hundred natives to help. Alas, there is scarcely a trace of it left  now! The great iron try-pots, built up in furnaces of coral lime, were  overgrown by the green jungle thirty years ago, and it would be difficult even  to find them now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives, as I have said, were very wild, savage, and warlike;  but as time went on their friendship for my husband and myself and children  deepened, and so when Robert made a voyage to Port Jackson or to any of the  surrounding islands I never felt in the least alarmed. I must tell you that  we&mdash;my husband and myself&mdash;were actually the first white people that had landed  to live on the island since the time of the <i>Bounty</i> mutiny, when Fletcher  Christian and his fellow mutineers tried to settle here. They brought the <i>Bounty</i> in, and anchored her just where your own schooner is now lying&mdash;opposite Randle&rsquo;s  house. But the natives attacked Christian and his men so fiercely, and so  repeatedly, though with terrible loss to themselves, that at last Christian and  Edward Young abandoned the attempt to found a settlement, and the <i>Bounty</i> went back to Tahiti, and finally to Afit&acirc;, as the people here call Pitcairn  Islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years passed by. My husband was making money fast, not only  as a trader among the Paumotus and the Society Islands, where he had two small  vessels constantly employed, but from his whale fishery. Then came a time of  sorrow and misfortune. A South Seaman, named the <i>Stirling Castle</i>,  touched here for provisions, and introduced small-pox, and every one of my poor  children contracted the disease and died; many hundreds of the natives perished  as well. My husband at this time was away in one of his vessels at Fakarava  Lagoon in the Paumotu Group, and I spent a very lonely and unhappy seven months  before he returned. Almost every morning, accompanied by one or two of my native  women servants, I would ascend that rugged peak about two miles from here, from  where we had a complete view of the horizon all round the island, and watch for  a sail. Twice my heart gladdened, only to be disappointed again, for the ships  on both occasions were Nantucket whalers. And then, as the months went by, I  began to imagine that something dreadful had happened to my husband and his  ship among the wild people of the Paumotus, for when he sailed he did not  expect to be away more than three months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, however, when I was quite worn out and ill with anxiety,  he returned. I was asleep when he arrived, for it was late at night, and his  vessel had not entered the harbour, though he had come ashore in a boat. He  awakened me very gently, and then, before I could speak to him and tell him of  our loss, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me, Molly. I have heard it all just now. But, there,  I&rsquo;m home again, dear; and I shall never stay away so long again, now that our  children have been taken and you and I are alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After another year had passed, and when I was well and strong  again, the whaleship <i>Chalice</i> of Sag Harbour, Captain Freeman, touched  here, and the master came on shore. He was an old acquaintance of my husband&rsquo;s,  and told us that he had come ashore purposely to warn us of a piratical vessel  which had made her appearance in these seas a few months before, and had seized  two or three English and American ships, and murdered every living soul of  their crews. She hailed from Coquimbo, and her captain was said to be a  Frenchman, whilst her crew was composed of the worst ruffians to be found on  the coast of South America&mdash;men whose presence on shore would not be tolerated  even by the authorities at any of the Spanish settlements from Panama to  Valdivia. Sailing under French colours, and professing to be a privateer, she  had actually attacked a French merchant brig within fifty miles of Coquimbo  Roads, the captain and the crew of which were slaughtered and the vessel  plundered and then burnt. Since then she had been seen by several vessels in  the Paumoto archipelago, where her crew had been guilty of the most fearful  crimes, perpetrated on the natives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband thanked Freeman for his information; but said that if  the pirate vessel came into Tubuai Lagoon she would never get out again, except  under British colours. This was no idle boast, for not only were my husband&rsquo;s  two vessels&mdash;which were then both at anchor in the lagoon&mdash;well armed, but they  were manned by English or English-blooded half-caste seamen, who would have  only been too delighted to fight a Frenchman, or a Spaniard, or a Dutchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;tis so long ago, but what brave, rough fellows they were!  Some of them, we well knew, had been transported as convicts, and were, when  opportunity offered, drunken and dissolute, but to my husband and myself they  were good and loyal men. Two of them had seen Trafalgar day in the <i>Royal  Sovereign</i> under Collingwood when that ship had closed with the <i>Santa  Anna</i> and made her strike. Their names&mdash;as given to us&mdash;were James Watts and  Thomas Godwin. After the fleet returned to England they got into mischief, and  were transported for being concerned in a smuggling transaction at Deal, in  Kent, in which a preventive officer was either killed or seriously wounded&mdash;I  forget which. Their exemplary conduct, however, had gained them a remission of  their sentences, and the Governor of New South Wales, who was most anxious to  open up the South Sea Island trade, had recommended them to my husband as good  men, Godwin having been brought up to the boatbuilding trade at Lowestoft in  England, and Watts as a gunsmith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten days after the visit of the <i>Chalice</i> my husband  left in one of his vessels for Vavitao&mdash;only a day&rsquo;s sail from here. He wanted  me to go with him, but I was too much interested in a large box of English  seeds, and some young fruit trees which the Governor of New South Wales had  sent to us, and so I said I would stay and watch our garden, in which I took a  great pride. He laughed and said that I must not forget to look out for &lsquo;Freeman&rsquo;s  pirate&rsquo; as well as for my garden. He never for one moment imagined that the  French vessel would turn up at Tubuai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took with him Thomas Godwin and William Myson, leaving Watts,  who was master of the other vessel, with me, to attend to the whaling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week after he had sailed I set out to walk to the north end of  the island, where my children were buried. I had with me an active native boy  named Tati&mdash;who was carrying some plants and seeds which I intended planting on  and about the children&rsquo;s graves&mdash;and two young women. We started early in the  morning, for I intended staying at the north end till late in the afternoon,  whilst the two girls went crayfishing on the reef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About noon I had finished my labours, and then, as it was a  beautifully bright day, I climbed a hill near by, called &lsquo;The White Man&rsquo;s  Lookout,&rsquo; which commanded a clear view of the sea all round the island. It had  been given this name by the natives, who said that Fletcher Christian and his  fellow-mutineer, Edward Young, had often ascended the hill and gazed out upon  the ocean, for they were fearful that at any moment a King&rsquo;s ship might appear  in pursuit of their comrades and themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was again feeling somewhat anxious on account of my husband. He  should have returned a week before, for there had been no bad weather, and I  knew that his business at Vavitao should have kept him there only a day at the  most. But the moment I gained the summit of the hill my heart leapt with joy,  for there were two vessels in sight, one of which I at once recognised as my  husband&rsquo;s. They were about a mile distant, and were running before the wind for  the harbour. The strange vessel, which was a brigantine, was following close  astern of our own schooner&mdash;evidently, I thought, my husband is showing her the  way into the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I was preparing to descend the hill my little companion,  the native boy, Tati, drew my attention to four canoes which, in company with a  boat from Captain Watts&rsquo; schooner, were approaching the vessels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;Watts has seen the vessels from the whaling  station, and is going out to meet them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But presently something occurred which filled me with terror.  When the boat and canoes were quite close to the vessels, they both luffed, and  fired broadsides into them; the boat and two canoes were evidently destroyed,  and the two remaining canoes at once turned round and headed for the shore, the  brigantine firing at them with guns which I knew to be long twenty-fours by the  sharp sound they made. In a moment I knew what had happened&mdash;my husband&rsquo;s ship  had been captured by the French privateer of which Captain Freeman had told us,  and the Frenchmen were now coming to seize our other selves lying anchored in  the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tati looked at me inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Run,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;run and tell Uasi (for so the natives called  Captain Watts) that the master and his ship have been captured by an enemy, who  will be upon him very quickly, for the boat and two of the canoes he has sent  out have been destroyed, and every one in them killed. Tell him I am coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy darted away in a moment, and I followed him as quickly as  I could; but Tati reached the harbour and was on board Watts&rsquo; schooner quite  half an hour before me, and when I went on board I found the vessel was  prepared to defend the entrance to the harbour. Captain Watts had swung her  broadside on to the entrance, boarding nettings were already triced up from  stem to stern, and on the schooner&rsquo;s decks were fifty determined natives, in  addition to the usual crew of twenty men, all armed with muskets and cutlasses.  The four 6-pounders which she carried, two on each side, were now all on the  port side, loaded with grape-shot, and in fact every preparation had been made  to fight the ship to the last. Watts met me as soon as I stepped on board, and  told me that before my messenger Tati had arrived to warn him he had heard the  sound of the firing at sea, and at once surmised that something was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Soon after you left the house, Mrs. Eury, some natives sighted  the two vessels to the north-east and I sent the boatswain and four men off in  one of the whale-boats, little thinking that I was sending them to their death.  Four canoes went with the boat. Just now two of the canoes came back with half  of their number dead or wounded, and the survivors told me that as soon as they  were within musket-shot both the ships opened fire on them, sunk the boat and  two of the canoes with grape-shot, and then began a heavy musketry fire. I  fear, madam, that Captain Eury and his ship&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your fears are mine, Watts,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but whether my husband is  alive or dead, let us at least try and save this vessel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay, ay, madam. And if we have to give up the ship, we can beat  them off on shore. There are a hundred or more natives lying hidden at the back  of the oil shed, and if the Frenchmen capture this vessel they will cover our  retreat ashore. They are all armed with muskets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waited anxiously for the two ships to appear; but the wind had  gradually died away until it fell a dead calm. Then a native runner hailed us  from the shore, and said that both vessels had anchored off the reef, and were  manning their boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All the better for us,&rsquo; said Watts grimly; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll smash them up  quick enough if they try boarding. If they had sailed in, the Frenchman&rsquo;s long  guns would have sunk us easily, and our wretched guns could not have done him  much harm.&rsquo; Then he went round the decks, and saw that the crew and their  native allies were all at their proper stations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently he saw the boats&mdash;five of them&mdash;come round the point. Two  of them we recognised as belonging to my husband&rsquo;s vessel, though they were, of  course, manned by Frenchmen. They rowed leisurely in through the entrance till  they were within musket-shot, and then the foremost one ceased rowing, and  hoisted a white flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They want us to surrender without a fight,&rsquo; said Watts, &lsquo;or are  meditating some treachery,&rsquo; and taking a musket from one of the crew he  levelled it and fired in defiance. The bullet struck the water within a foot of  the boat. The white flag, however, was held up higher by the officer in the  stern. Watts seized a second musket, and this time his bullet went plump into  the crowded boat, and either killed or wounded some one, for there was a  momentary confusion. Then the white flag was lowered, and with loud cheers the  five boats made a dash towards us. Telling the gunners to reserve their fire of  grape until he gave the word, Watts and the natives now began a heavy musketry  fire on the advancing boats, and although they suffered heavily the Frenchmen  came on most gallantly. Then when the first two boats, which were pulling  abreast, were within fifty yards&rsquo; distance, Watts and a white seaman sprang to  two of the guns and themselves trained them, just as I heard a native near me  cry out that in the bows of each boat he could see a man&mdash;my husband and his  chief mate, who were both bound. Before I could utter a warning cry to Watts,  both of the guns belched out their volleys of grape, and with awful effect. The  boats were literally torn to pieces, and their mangled occupants sank under the  smooth waters of the lagoon; only two or three seemed to have escaped  unwounded, and as they clung to pieces of wreckage our savage allies, with  yells of fury, picked them off with their muskets; for the same native who had  seen my husband bound in the boat had seen him sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No quarter to any one of them!&rsquo; roared Watts when he heard this;  &lsquo;the cowards lashed Captain Eury and poor Mr. Myson to the bows of the boats,  and our own fire has killed them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sprang to the third gun, the white seaman to the fourth, and  waited for the other three boats, which, undaunted by the dreadful slaughter,  were dashing on bravely. Again the guns were fired, and again a united yell of  delight broke from our crew when one of the boats was swept from stern to stern  with the deadly grape and filled and sank. The two others, however, escaped,  and in another moment were alongside, and the officer in command, followed by  his men, sprang at the boarding nettings, and began hacking and slashing at  them with their cutlasses, only to be thrust back, dead or dying, by our  valiant crew, and the now blood-maddened natives. Nine or ten of them did  succeed in gaining a foothold on the deck, by clambering up the bobstay on to  the bowsprit, and led by a mere boy of sixteen, made a determined charge; a  native armed with a club sprang at the youth and dashed out his brains, though  at the same moment a Frenchman thrust him through the body with his cutlass.  But the boarding party were simply overwhelmed by numbers, and in less than  five minutes every one of those who had reached the deck were slaughtered with  but a loss of three men on our side. Those still remaining in the boats  alongside then tried to draw off, but Watts, who was now more like a mad animal  than a human being, calling to some of the crew to help him, himself cut down  the boarding netting, and lifting one of the 6-pounders, hurled it bodily into  one of the boats, smashing a large hole through it. Then a score of naked  natives leapt into the remaining one, and cut and stabbed the crew till not a  living soul remained. Some indeed had tried to swim to the shore a few minutes  earlier, but these poor wretches were met by canoes, and their brains beaten  out with clubs. The memory of that awful day of carnage will be with me if I  live to be a hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as possible Watts and the carpenter restored some order  among our native allies, who, according to their custom, were beheading and  otherwise mutilating the bodies of the enemy. We found that we had lost four  killed and had about thirteen wounded. Of those killed two were white men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then taking with me half a dozen natives, I went off in one of  our own boats to the spot where our grape-shot had sunk the boat in which the  native had said he had seen my husband. The water was only about four fathoms  deep, and we could clearly see numbers of bodies lying on the white sandy  bottom. One by one they were raised to the surface and examined, and the fifth  one raised was that of my poor husband. His arms were bound behind his back,  and his chest and face were shattered by grape-shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wild fury took possession of me, but I could not speak. I could  only point to the ship. We went back on board, and my husband&rsquo;s body was laid  on deck for the crew to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know what I did or said, but I do remember that Watts  swore to me that I should be revenged, and in a few minutes I was seated beside  him in one of our own boats with a pistol in my hand, and we, in company with  thirty or forty canoes, were on our way to the ships anchored outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What followed I cannot remember, but Watts told me that I was the  first to spring up the side of the French brigantine, and that the captain, as  I fired my pistol at him, struck off my hand with his sword, and was then himself  cut down by the carpenter. There were but nine men on board, and these were  soon disposed of by our men, who gave no quarter. My husband&rsquo;s vessel was in  charge of but three of the enemy, and from them, when they surrendered, we  heard that every one of her crew, except the mate Myson and my husband, had  been cruelly slaughtered at Vavitao a few days previously. Watts tried to save  the lives of these three men, but in vain; the natives killed them, in spite of  all his efforts. They died bravely enough, poor wretches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watts and the carpenter succeeded in saving my life, and the  stump of my arm healed up very quickly, for I was always a strong and vigorous  woman. When they came to search the cabin of the French brigantine they found  that her captain&mdash;the man who had cut off my hand&mdash;was Louis Pellatier, the very  same man who, years before, had attempted to shoot my poor husband at the  Galapagos Islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sailed with Watts to Port Jackson a few months later in the  French brigantine, which was sold as a prize, and remained there for nearly two  years. Then the loneliness of my life began to affect my health, and so I  returned here to live and die. And here on this island have I lived for nearly  fifty years in peace and happiness, for since Randle and his family came here I  have been very happy, and now I only await the last call of all&mdash;that call which  will summon me to stand before the throne, side by side with my dear husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="FiveHeadCreek"></a>&ldquo;Five-Head&rdquo;  Creek;</b> </h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>I</b></h3>
<p>I had ridden all day through an endless vista  of ghostly grey gums and ironbarks, when I came in sight of the long wavering  line of vivid green foliage which showed me that I had reached my destination&mdash;a  roughly-built slab hut with a roof of corrugated iron. This place was to be my  home for six months, and stood on the bank of Five-Head Creek, twenty-five  miles from the rising city of Townsville in North Queensland.</p>
<p>Riding up to the building, I got off my  wearied, sweating horse, and, removing the saddle and my blanket and other  impediments, led him to the creek to drink, and then hobbled and turned him  loose to feed on the soft lush grass and reeds growing along the margin of the  water. Then I entered the empty house, made a brief examination of it, and  wondered how my mate would like living in such an apparently comfortless abode.</p>
<p>I must mention that I had come from Townsville  to take charge of Five-Head Creek cattle run, which had suffered so severely  from a terrible drought that it had been temporarily abandoned. We were to look  after and repair the fencing, many miles&rsquo; length of which had been destroyed by  fire or succumbed to white ants, to search for and collect the remnant of the  cattle that had not perished in the drought, and see after the place generally.  My mate was to follow me out in a few days with a dray-load of stores.</p>
<p>I lit a fire, boiled a billy of tea, and ate  some cold beef and damper. Then, as the sun dipped below a range of low hills  to the westward, I filled my pipe, and, walking down to the bank of the creek,  surveyed my environs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a God-forsaken-looking country!&rdquo; I  thought as I gazed around me; and, indeed, the prospect was anything but  inviting. On both sides of the creek the soil showed evidences of the severity  of the past drought. Great gaping fissures&mdash;usun cracks we called them&mdash;traversed  and zig-zagged the hot, parching ground, on which not a blade of grass was to  be seen. Here and there, amid the grey-barked ghostly gums, were oases of  green&mdash;thickets of stunted sandalwood whose evergreen leaves defied alike the  torrid summer heat and the black frosts of winter months; but underneath them  lay the shrivelled carcasses and whitening bones of hundreds of cattle which  had perished of starvation&mdash;too weak even to totter down to die, bogged in the  banks of the creek. As I sat and smoked a strong feeling of depression took  possession of me; I already began to hate the place, and regretted I could not  withdraw from my engagement.</p>
<p>Yet in less than a week I began to like it,  and when I left it I did so with some regret, for I had made friends with sweet  Mother Nature, whose loving-kindness is with us always in wild places, though  we may not know it at first, and take no heed of her many calls and silent  beckonings to us to come and love, and rest and dream, and be content upon her  tender, mighty bosom.</p>
<p>My horse, cropping eagerly at the soft grass  and salty pigweed, suddenly raised his head and pricked up his ears. He had  heard something and was listening, and looking across to the opposite bank I  saw a sight that lifted me out of my sudden fit of depression and then filled  me with delight.</p>
<p>Two stately emus were walking along in single  file, the male bird leading, holding his head erect, and marching like the  drum-major of a regiment of Guards. On the margin of the bank they halted and  looked at the horse, which now stood facing them; a minute&rsquo;s scrutiny satisfied  both parties that there was nothing to fear from each other, and then the great  birds walked down the bank to a broad dry patch of bright yellow sand, which  stretched halfway across the bed of the creek. Here the male began to scratch,  sending up a shower of coarse sand, and quickly swallowing such large pebbles  as were revealed, whilst the female squatted beside him and watched his labours  with an air of indifference. Her digestive apparatus was, I suppose, in good  order, and she did not need three or four pounds&rsquo; weight of stones in her  gizzard, but she did require a sand bath, for presently she too began to scrape  and sway from side to side as she worked a deep hole beneath her body, just as  a common hen scrapes and sways and ruffles her feathers in the dry dust of the  farmyard. In less than five minutes the huge bird was encompassed in a cloud of  flying sand, and working her long neck, great thick legs, and outspread toes  exactly as an ordinary fowl. Then, having thoroughly covered herself with sand  from beak to tail, she rose, shook herself violently, and stalked away up the  bank again, where her companion soon followed her, and I lost sight of the pair  as they strode through the thick green of the she-oak trees.</p>
<p>As darkness fell I built up a larger fire and  spread my blanket beside it to sleep under the open sky instead of in the  deserted house, for the night was soft, warm, and windless. Overhead was a  firmament of cloudless blue, with here and there a shining star beginning to  show; but away to the south-west a dark line of cloud was rising and spreading,  and I felt cheered at the sight, for it was a sign of rain. As I watched it  steadily increasing the first voices of the night began to call&mdash;a &rsquo;possum  squealed from the branches of a blue gum in the creek, and was answered by  another somewhere near; and then the long, long mournful wail of a curlew cried  out from the sunbaked plain beyond. Oh, the unutterable sense of loneliness  that at times the long-drawn, penetrating cry of the curlew, resounding through  the silence of the night amid the solitude of vast Australian plains, causes  the solitary bushman or traveller to feel! I well remember on one occasion  camping on the banks of the Lower Burdekin River, and having my broken  slumbers&mdash;for I was ill with fever&mdash;disturbed by a brace of curlews, which were  uttering their depressing cries within a few hundred yards of me, and how I at  last became so wrought up and almost frenzied by the persistency of their  doleful notes, that I followed them up with a Winchester rifle, mile after  mile, wasting my cartridges and exhausting mind and body in the vain attempt to  shoot them in the dark. There is to my knowledge nothing so mournful as the  call of the curlew, unless it be the moaning cry of a penguin out upon the  ocean, when a sea-fog encompasses the ship that lies becalmed. There is  something so intensely human about it&mdash;as if some lost soul were wailing for  mercy and forgiveness.</p>
<p>But on this night the cry of the curlew was  pleasing to my ear, for as I lay and watched the rising bank of cloud, I heard  others calling from the opposite bank of the creek, and then a parrot screamed shrilly&mdash;and  I knew that rain was certain. I jumped up, carried my blanket, saddle, and gun  into the house, and then went out to collect firewood. My horse, as he heard my  footsteps, bounded up, hobbled as he was, from the bed of the creek, and  neighed to me in the darkness. He too smelt the coming rain, and was speaking  to me out of his gladness of heart. I called back to him, and then set to work  and soon collected a number of dry logs, which I carried in to the hut and  threw down on the hard earthen floor made of pulverised ant heaps, just as the  welcome thunder muttered away off in the distance.</p>
<p>I brought a burning brand from the fire, threw  it inside, and then called to my horse. Taking off his hobbles, I slipped the  bridle over his head, and brought him in under shelter of the verandah, where  he stood quietly, with a full stomach and contented mind, watching the coming  storm.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the iron roof of the house  was singing a sweet, delightful tune to the heavy down-pouring rain, which,  till long past midnight, fell in generous volume, the dry, thirsty soil  drinking it in with gladness as it closed up the gaping fissures, and gave hope  and vigour and promise of life to the parched and perishing vegetation of the  wide plains around.</p>
<p>With supreme satisfaction I sat at the open  door, and smoked and watched, with my fire blazing merrily away; then, before  it was too late, I stripped off, and went out and let the rain wash off the  dust and dirt of a day&rsquo;s journey under a fierce, baking sun. How cool, delightful,  and invigorating it felt!</p>
<p>I dried myself with a spare shirt, and then  lay down on my blanket beside the fire to listen contentedly to the clamour of  the rain upon the roof. About two in the morning the downpour ceased, the sky  cleared, and a fair half-moon of silvery brightness shone out above the tops of  the white gum forest. Fifty yards or so away, in front of the door, a shallow  pool had formed in a depression of the hard, sun-baked soil, and as the soft  light of the moon fell upon it there came a whirr of wings as a flock of  night-roving, spur-winged plover lit upon its margin. I could have shot half a  dozen of them from where I sat, but felt that I could not lift gun to shoulder  and slaughter when there was no need, and their shrill cries, as they ran to  and fro, afforded me an infinite pleasure.</p>
<p>I took off my horse&rsquo;s bridle, put his hobbles  on again, rubbed my cheek against his warm, moist nose, and left him. An hour  before daylight he stepped quietly inside and stood near the fire&mdash;the mosquitoes  were annoying him, and he had come in to get the benefit of what little smoke  was arising from the burning logs.</p>
<p>At dawn, as I lay half-awake, I heard a sound  that made me jump to my gun&mdash;the soft quacking of wild duck in the creek.  Stealing cautiously down through the fringe of she-oaks, I came to a fine broad  pool, in the centre of which was a small sandbank, whereon stood a black duck  with a brood of seven half-fledged ducklings around her, dabbling merrily  amongst the weed and <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the margin. Of course, no one who <i>thinks</i>,  unless impelled by sheer hunger, would shoot either an incubating or &ldquo;just  familied&rdquo; duck, and I laid down my gun with an exclamation of disappointment.  But I was soon to be rewarded, for a minute or two later five beautiful black  and white Burdekin ducks flashed down through the vista of she-oaks, and  settled on the water less than thirty yards away from me. They lit so closely  together that my first barrel killed two, and my second dropped one of the  others as they rose. I waded in and brought them ashore.*</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The name &ldquo;Burdekin&rdquo; has  been given to these ducks because they are so common on the river of that name.  Their wings are pure white and black.</p>
<p>I wonder how many people know how to cook and  eat wild duck as they should be cooked and eaten&mdash;when they are plentiful, and  when the man who shoots them is, in his way, a gourmet, and is yet living away  from civilisation and restaurants? This is <i>the</i> way. Pluck the feathers  off the breast and body, then cut the breast part out, sprinkle it with salt,  impale it upon a stick&mdash;if you have a stick or branch of any kind&mdash;and hold it  over a fire of glowing wood coals. If you have no skewer, then lay the red,  luscious-looking flesh upon the coals themselves, and listen to it singing and fizzing,  as if it were impatiently crying out to you to take it up and eat it!</p>
<p>When I returned, the sunrays were piercing  through the gum-trees and dissipating a thin mist which hung about the green,  winding fringe of she-oaks bordering the creek. From the ground, which now felt  soft, warm, and springy to my naked foot, there came that sweet earthy smell  that arises when the land has lain for long, long months under a sky of brass,  and all green things have struggled hard to live. As I drew near the hut I saw  that the flock of spur-winged plover were still standing or running about the  margin of the newly-formed pool. They took not the slightest notice of my  approach, and I was careful not to alarm them, knowing that as long as the  water remained they would continue to haunt the vicinity of the pool, and,  besides that, I already had three plump ducks, which would last me at least  till the following morning.</p>
<p>After breakfast I set out to make a detailed  examination of the creek for a distance of three or four miles towards its  source. I was glad to find some very extensive water-holes at intervals of a  few hundred yards, then would come a stretch of sand from bank to bank, for  owing to the want of rain the water had fallen very low, though it was still  flowing by percolation through the sand. Yet, in time of flood, the whole of  the flat country was submerged, and some of the large gum-trees growing on the  banks held in their forks, thirty-five feet from the ground, great piles of  dead wood and tangled debris that had been deposited there in a great flood of  two years before.</p>
<p>I was not long in making a very pleasing  discovery&mdash;all the pools contained fish, some of which were of good size, for  the water was so clear that I could see them swimming about, and I remembered  now with satisfaction that among the stores coming on in the dray was a bundle  of fishing-tackle which I had bought in Townsville. Bird life all along the  creek was plentiful; but this was to be expected, as the long drought had  naturally driven game of all sort towards the water. I saw two or three small  kangaroos, and everywhere along the margin were bandicoot holes, where the  little pig-like creatures had been digging for roots.</p>
<p>Two miles from the hut I came across a  well-constructed native fish-weir, and near by found the site of a camp;  evidently a party of blacks had been enjoying themselves quite recently,  fishing and cattle killing, for under some scrub I found the head and foreleg  of a young steer.</p>
<p>As I walked my horse slowly over the sand  under the fringing oaks, I made the unpleasant discovery that snakes were very  plentiful&mdash;not only the harmless carpet snake, but the deadly brown and  black-necked tiger variety; though against this were a corresponding number of  iguanas, both of the tree-climbing and water-haunting species. The latter, to  which I shall again allude, is a particularly shuddersome reptile. I had never  before seen these repulsive creatures, and, indeed, had never heard of them.</p>
<p>I returned to the hut at noon, and to my  surprise found a party of thirty or more blacks camped under some Leichhardt  trees. They seemed a fairly healthy lot of savages, and were not alarmed when  they saw I was carrying a gun. I rode quietly up to them, and shook hands with  two or three of the bucks, who spoke a little English. They were, they told me,  from the Ravenswood district, which they had left some weeks ago, and were now  travelling towards the Burdekin, hunting as they went.</p>
<p>Some of them came to the hut with me, and I  saw at once that they had not taken anything of mine, though among other  articles I had left on a wooden seat outside were several plugs of tobacco. I  gave them a plug to divide, and then asked the most voluble of them how many  cattle they had speared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baal blackfellow spear him cattle,&rdquo; he  answered.*</p>
<p class="note">* Lit., &ldquo;We blacks did not spear any cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that young fellow bullock you been  eat longa creek?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>They assured me that they had not speared the  animal, which they had found lying at the bottom of a deep gully with a broken  leg. Then knowing it could not live, they had killed and eaten it. I was  pleased to hear this, and have no doubt the poor creatures told the truth. They  remained with myself and mate for a month, and proved of great assistance to us  in fencing and other work, and I learnt much valuable bush-craft from these  wandering savages, especially of their methods of hunting and fishing. I shall  now give the reader an account of some of the happy days my mate and myself  spent in this lonely spot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>II</b></h3>
<p>A few days later my mate arrived with the  dray, which we at once unloaded, and then turned the horses out to feed and  have a spell before working them again. Every night since I had arrived a  thunderstorm had occurred, much to my delight, and already the once cracked and  baking flats were beginning to put on a carpet of grass; and indeed, in three  weeks it was eighteen inches high, and made a glorious sight, the few remaining  cattle eating it so hungrily that when night fell the creatures were scarcely  able to move, so distended were their stomachs.</p>
<p>Having started our aboriginal friends to cut  down ironbark saplings to repair the fencing, we first of all paid a visit to  our nearest neighbour, a settler named Dick Bullen, who lived ten miles away.  He received us most hospitably, like all good bushmen, and offered to assist us  in looking for lost cattle. He was a splendid type of the native-born  Australian bushman, over six feet two in height, and simple and unaffected in  his manner. I shall remember this man for one thing. He had two of the finest  teams of working bullocks I have ever seen, and handled them in a way that  commanded our admiration. Never once did he use his whip for any other purpose  than to crack it occasionally, and it did one good to hear his cheery call to  the fourteen labouring beasts as they toiled up the steep side of a creek or  gully with a heavy load of timber, straining every nerve in their great bodies,  while the sweat poured off their coats in streams. He was like one of his own  bullocks, patient, cheerful, and strong, and an exclamation of anger seldom  passed his lips&mdash;an oath never. He took a great pride in the appearance of his  teams, and especially of the fact that no one of them showed the marks of a  whip.</p>
<p>We spent a pleasant hour with this man, and  returned home by a different route, in the hope of getting a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; turkey&mdash;an  altogether different bird from the &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; turkey. Hansen (my mate) was an  excellent shot, especially with a rifle, and indeed when shooting turkeys  preferred to use a 44 Winchester rifle. We managed to get one bird&mdash;a cock&mdash;but  so old and poor that we gave it to the black contingent to eat. Nothing in the  shape of food came amiss to these people, and their appetites were astounding.  One day Hansen and I were following down a creek which junctioned with the Reid  River, when we saw smoke ascending from a dry gully. Riding up we came across a  very old and shrivelled gin and a boy and girl of about eight years of age.  They were busily engaged in eating emu eggs, and out of thirteen had already  devoured eleven, together with four or five hundred of fresh-water cockles!  Such a meal would have satisfied half a dozen hungry white men. Their  over-loaded stomachs presented a disgusting appearance, and they were scarcely  able to articulate.</p>
<p>A week after our arrival the blacks told us  that there were indications that the rainy season would come on earlier than  usual, and that game, except duck and spur-winged plover, would be very scarce;  also that if the creek came down in flood, it would carry away most of the  fish. This was bad news for such ardent sportsmen as Hansen and myself, for we  were looking forward to plenty of fishing and shooting, not alone for its  pleasures, but also because we were charged heavily for anything but the ordinary  salt beef, tea, sugar and flour. Sardines and tinned salmon were luxuries we  could not afford, but fresh fish and game were better, and, even when salted,  were preferrable to a continuous diet of beef.</p>
<p>We had among our stores a 250 lb. bag of  coarse salt&mdash;we had to kill our own meat and salt it down&mdash;and I proposed that we  should at once set to work whilst the weather was fine and spend a week  shooting and fishing. Such game as plain turkeys (the bustard), scrub turkeys,  cockatoos, ducks, &amp;c., we could put in brine, whilst the fish could be  drysalted and then put in the sun to dry. Hansen quite approved the idea, and  we at once set to work. I was to be fisherman, and he the gunner; for,  curiously enough, my mate was the most helpless creature with a fishing-line  or rod that I ever saw. In five minutes he would either have his line  hopelessly tangled, his rod broken, or his hook caught in his hand; and yet he  never lost his temper.</p>
<p>Taking with me two sturdy black boys as  porters, and also bringing my gun and ammunition in case of meeting duck, I set  out on foot, Hansen riding off, accompanied by a blackfellow, to a chain of  shallow lagoons five miles away.</p>
<p>Within a quarter of a mile from the house was  a fine deep water-hole formed by the creek being here confined between high  banks. At one end, however, an exposed bar of small, coarse round pebbles ran  almost across, and here I decided to begin, instead of from the bank, for not  only were snakes difficult to see in the undergrowth, but plants of the dreaded  stinging-tree were also growing around and between the magnificent gums and the  Leichhardts. These latter trees, named after the ill-fated Dr. Leichhardt, are,  I think, the most strikingly handsome of all large trees in the north of  Queensland. They love to grow near or even in the water, and their broad,  beautiful leaves give a welcome shade.</p>
<p>But before I descended to the bank I had to  remain for some minutes to gaze on the beauty of the scene. The water at one  end of the pool was of the deepest blue, towards the pebbly bar it gradually  shallowed, and for the next eight or ten feet from the margin was as clear as  crystal. Close in under the banks the broad leaves of blue flowering  water-lilies covered the surface with a carpet of many shades of green and pink;  hovering above the lily leaves were hundreds of small white butterflies, with  here and there a black and yellow-banded dragon-fly&mdash; &ldquo;horse-stingers&rdquo; the  Australian youth call them. Not a sound broke the silence, except now and then  the rippling splash of a fish rising to the surface, or the peculiar <i>click,  click</i> made by a crayfish burrowing under a stone.</p>
<p>I leant over the bank and looked down, and  then gave a start of pleasure, for right beneath me were three fish floating  motionless on the surface&mdash;fish that, until then, I never knew lived in fresh  water. They were in shape, colour, and appearance exactly like the toothed gar  so common on the sea coast&mdash;a long slender body with back of dark blue, sides of  silvery white, and fins and tail of blue tipped with yellow. I was so excited  that I was about to shoot them, but remembered that at so short a distance I  should have only blown them to pieces, especially as they were directly beneath  me. I motioned to the blackboys to come and look; they did so, and I learnt  that these fish, when the creek was low, were sometimes plentiful, and would  take almost any floating bait, especially if it were alive.</p>
<p>Eager to begin, I told the boys to collect  some crayfish for bait, but they said that it would take too long, and small  fish were better, and running to some small lily-covered pools about two feet  in diameter, and very shallow, they jumped in and stirred up the sand and muddy  sediment at the bottom. In a few minutes some scores of very pretty red and  silvery-hued minnows were thrown out on the sand. I quickly baited my line, and  threw it, with the sinker attached, into the centre of the pool; before it  could sink the bait was taken by a fine bream of 2 lbs., which I landed safely,  and tossed to the boys. It was the first fresh-water bream I had caught in  Queensland, and I felt elated.</p>
<p>Finding that the pool was clear of snags, I  bent on three extra hooks, baiting each one with the whole of a tiny fish.  Again the baits were seized before they reached the bottom; I hauled in two  more bream, and as they came struggling and splashing into the shallow water I  saw they were being followed by literally hundreds of the same species, and  also by fish much like an English grayling&mdash;the pool seemed to be alive! The  presence of such large numbers in so circumscribed a space could, however, be  easily accounted for by the absence of rain for so many months, the drying up  of many minor pools and stretches, and the diminution of the water generally  throughout the creek and its tributaries driving the fish to congregate in the  deeper and larger pools.</p>
<p>By noon I had caught as many fish as the boys  could carry. None, it is true, were very large, 2 1/2 lbs. being the heaviest;  but I was pleased to learn that there were places farther down the creek where  the blacks frequently caught some very large cat-fish; when the water was muddy  from heavy rain. These cat-fish, or, as some people call them, &ldquo;jew-fish,&rdquo; are  the heaviest and best of all the Queensland river fish I have ever tasted,  except those which, for want of their true name, I called grayling, and Hansen  asserted were trout.</p>
<p>Sending the black boys off with the fish, I  cut a rod from a she-oak and quickly rigged a line; for a float I used a small  piece of dead wood, and baited with the largest minnow I could find. Then,  clambering up the bank, I found a suitable open place to stand at the butt of a  Leichhardt, from where I had a good view. I could not, however, see any of the  gars, one at least of which I was so anxious to get, but made a cast into the  centre&mdash;and almost instantly one darted out from under the lily leaves and  hooked himself beautifully, but in swinging him out my line fouled a thorny  bush, and for a minute I was in despair; there was the shining beauty suspended  over the water, and almost making a circle of his body in his struggle to  escape. At last, however, I cleared my line, and swung my prize high up on the  bank. Determined to get a better rod, and return after dinner, I picked up gun  and fish and followed the boys.</p>
<p>By sunset I had a catch of fish that fairly  astonished Hansen when he returned at dusk with but half a dozen black duck,  two or three teal, and two turkeys. All that evening we were employed in  cleaning and salting the fish and birds, except some for immediate use.</p>
<p>We had many such days. Fish were to be had all  throughout the course of the creek, and had we possessed a net like those the  blacks sometimes used, we could have taken a hogsheadful in half an hour.</p>
<p>Then, as the rainy season began, I ceased  fishing and took to the gun, for now three or four kinds of duck made their  appearance, and one moonlight night an immense number alighted in the creek  just below the hut, and kept up an incessant gabble and quacking till sunrise.</p>
<p>In less than ten days we had enough salted  game and dried and smoked fish to last us three months, even had we eaten  nothing else. Our black friends&mdash;with the exception of one lad who desired to  remain&mdash;left us one morning at sunrise, and we saw them no more. I am afraid  they were deeply hurt by our poisoning half a dozen of their mangy dogs, which  were, with the rest of the pack, a continual source of annoyance to us by their  expert thieving.</p>
<p>One dull, rainy day, as we sat indoors mending  our clothes, and yarning and smoking, we heard the scream of parrots, and,  going to the door, saw some twenty or thirty of them, large, fine, green and  scarlet plumaged birds, hanging on to and crawling in and out among the  branches of some low trees growing between the stockyard and the creek. These  trees were a species of wattle, and were just opening out their yellow,  sweet-smelling, downy flowers, which the beautiful birds were devouring  eagerly. We did not disturb them, and they did not appear to be alarmed when we  walked up to within a few yards of the trees, merely screaming defiance, and  flying up to the higher branches, or to other trees near by. These birds the  local settlers called &ldquo;king-parrots&rdquo;; they were larger than those of the same  species in New South Wales, and later in the season we shot a few of them for  soup. This particular flock visited us for many days in succession, forming a  pretty picture as they hung on the branches, chattering loudly the while, and  flashing their gaily-coloured plumage in the bright sunshine. Like the  spur-winged plover, they were very inquisitive birds; if one of their number  was shot, and fell wounded, the rest of the flock would fly round and round the  poor creature, watching its movements and listening to its cries, not out of  pity, but of sheer curiosity, and each could be shot in succession, or  sometimes knocked down with a stick. I was told by a stockman on Fanning Downs  station that on several occasions when he had wounded birds of this variety of  the parrot tribe, their companions descended upon them with fury, tore out  their feathers, and bit and lacerated them savagely.</p>
<p>Now and again a few wandering emus would cross  the grey gum plains around us, and then, as they caught sight of our figures,  shamble quickly off again. In former years they had been plentiful in the  district, and provided good food for the aborigines when the latter organised  their big hunting parties. But as the country was taken up as cattle runs,  hundreds of the great birds were wantonly shot by white men for the mere  pleasure of killing, and all the months we lived in the district we did not see  more than twenty.</p>
<p>I have before spoken of the number of snakes  that were everywhere to be seen in the vicinity of the water, particularly  about pools with a reedy margin. Scarcely a week passed without our killing  three or four, and we were always careful in bathing to do so in very shallow  water, where there was a clear sandy bottom. There were three kinds of  water-snakes, one of which was of a dull blue colour, and these the blacks said  were &ldquo;bad fellow,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, venomous. They seldom grew over two feet and a  half in length, and on a bright day one might see several of these reptiles  swimming across from one bank to the other. Of the common brown snake&mdash;the kind  we most dreaded&mdash;and the black-necked tiger snake, we killed numbers with our  guns and with sticks, and one day, when crossing some red ironstone ridges on  the Ravenswood road, we despatched two death-adders which were lying asleep on  the bare, hot road. They were of a dull reddish brown, the same hue as the  ground in the ironstone country, just as they are a yellowish brown in a  sandstone region.</p>
<p>One great pest to us when fishing were the  number of mud turtles, greedy little creatures which persistently swallowed our  hooks, which could only be recovered by placing one&rsquo;s foot on their backs,  drawing out their long snaky necks to the utmost tension, and cutting off their  heads; the other pests were the hideous flabby water iguanas (I do not know  their proper name), which, although they never interfered with our lines,  sickened us even to look at them. They were always to be seen lying on a log or  snag in the water. As you approached they either crawled down like an octopus,  or dropped, in a boneless, inert mass, without a splash. Their slimy, scaleless  skins were a muddy yellow, and in general they resembled an eel with legs. Even  the blacks looked on them with disgust, though they are particularly fond of  the ordinary iguana.</p>
<p>The time passed somewhat wearily to us when  heavy rains and flooded country kept us indoors for days together. Then one  night after the weather had begun to get cooler and clearer, we heard, far, far  overhead, the <i>honk, honk</i> of the wild geese, flying southwards to distant  lagoons, and Hansen reminded me that in another week our term of service came  to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you think of it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cry of the wild geese going South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For we, too, longed for the South again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="FishDruggingInThePacific"></a>Fish Drugging In The Pacific</b></h2>
<p>In an American magazine of a few months ago  mention was made of the &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of a method of capturing fish by  impregnating the waters of slowly running rivers or small lakes with a chemical  which would produce stupefaction, and cause the fish to rise helpless to the  surface. The American discoverer no doubt thought he really had &ldquo;discovered,&rdquo;  though I am sure many thousands of people in the civilised world have heard of,  and some few hundreds very often seen, fish captured in a somewhat similar  manner, the which is, I believe, practised not only in India, Africa and South  America, but in the islands of the North and South Pacific, and I have no doubt  but that it was known thousands of years ago&mdash;perhaps even &ldquo;when the world was  young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly all the Malayo-Polynesian people  inhabiting the high, mountainous islands of the South Pacific and North Pacific  Oceans can, and do, catch fish in the &ldquo;novel&rdquo; manner before mentioned, <i>i.e.</i>,  by producing stupefaction, though no chemicals are used, while even the  Australian aborigines&mdash;almost as low a type of savage as the Fuegians&mdash;use a  still simpler method, which I will at once briefly describe as I saw it  practised by a mob of myall (wild) blacks camped on the Kirk River, a tributary  of the great Burdekin River in North Queensland.</p>
<p>At a spot where the stream was about a hundred  feet wide, and the water very shallow&mdash;not over six inches in depth&mdash;a rude but  efficient dam was expeditiously constructed by thrusting branches of she-oak  and <i>ti</i>-tree into the sandy bottom, and then making it partially  waterproof by quickly filling the interstices with earthen sods, <i>ti</i>-tree  bark, reeds, leaves, and the other <i>d&eacute;bris</i> found on the banks. In the  centre a small opening was left, so as to relieve the pressure when the water  began to rise. Some few hundred yards further up were a chain of water-holes,  some of which were deep, and in all of which, as I knew by experience, were  plenty of fish&mdash;bream, perch, and a species of grayling. As soon as the dam was  complete, the whole mob, except some &ldquo;gins&rdquo; and children, who were stationed to  watch the opening before mentioned, sprang into the water, carrying with them  great quantities of a greasy greyish blue kind of clay, which rapidly dissolved  and charged the clear water with its impurities. Then, too, at the same time  thirty or forty of their number (over a hundred) began loosening and tearing  away portions of the overhanging bank, and toppling them over into the stream;  this they accomplished very dexterously by means of heavy, pointed sticks. The  work was carried out with an astounding clamour, those natives in the water  diving to the bottom and breaking up the fallen earth still further till each  pool became of the colour and something of the consistency of green pea-soup.  Hundreds of fish soon rose gasping to the surface, and these were at once  seized and thrown out upon the banks, where a number of young picaninnies  darted upon them to save them being devoured by a swarm of mongrel dogs, which  lent an added interest to the proceedings by their incessant yelping and  snapping. As the slowly running current carried the suffocating and helpless  fish down-stream the hideous noise increased, for the shallow stretch in front  of the dam was soon covered with them&mdash;bream, and the so-called &ldquo;grayling,&rdquo;  perch, eels, and some very large cat-fish. The latter, which I have mentioned  on a previous page, is one of the most peculiar-looking but undoubtedly the  best flavoured of all the Queensland fresh-water fishes; it is scaleless, tail-less,  blue-grey in colour, and has a long dorsal spike, like the salt-water  &ldquo;leather-jacket.&rdquo; (A scratch from this spike is always dangerous, as it  produces intense pain, and often causes blood-poisoning.) Altogether over a  thousand fish must have been taken, and I gazed at the destruction with a  feeling of anger, for these pools had afforded my mining mates and myself  excellent sport, and a very welcome change of diet from the eternal beef and  damper. But, a few days later, after our black friends had wandered off to  other pastures, I was delighted to find that there were still plenty of fish in  the pools.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Early in the &ldquo;seventies&rdquo; I was shipwrecked  with the once notorious Captain &ldquo;Bully&rdquo; Hayes, on Kusaie (Strong&rsquo;s Island), the  eastern outlier of the Caroline Islands on the North Pacific, and lived there  for twelve happy months, and here I saw for the first time the method of fish  stupefaction employed by the interesting and kindly-natured people of this  beautiful spot.</p>
<p>I had previously seen, in Eastern Polynesia,  the natives drugging fish by using the pounded nuts of the <i>futu</i> tree (<i>Barringtonia  speciosa</i>), and one day as I was walking with a native friend along the  beach near the village in which I lived, I picked up a <i>futu</i> nut lying on  the sand, and remarked that in the islands to the far south the people used it  to drug fish.</p>
<p>Kusis laughed. &ldquo;<i>Futu</i> is good, but we of  Kusaie do not use it&mdash;we have <i>oap</i> which is stronger and better. Come, I  will show you some <i>oap</i> growing, and to-morrow you shall see how good it  is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning off to our right, we passed through a  grove of screw-pines, and then came to the foot of the high mountain range  traversing the island, where vine and creeper and dense jungle undergrowth  struggled for light and sunshine under the dark shade of giant trees, whose  thick leafy branches, a hundred feet above, were rustling to the wind. Here,  growing in the rich, red soil, was a cluster of <i>oap</i>&mdash;a thin-stemmed,  dark-green-leaved plant about three feet in height. Kusis pulled one by the  roots, and twisted it round and round his left hand; a thick, white and sticky  juice exuded from the bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It &lsquo;sickens&rsquo; the fish very quickly,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;quicker than the <i>futu</i> nut. If much of it be bruised and thrown into the  water, it kills the largest fish very soon, and even turtles will &lsquo;sicken.&rsquo; It  is very strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him how the people of Kusaie first  became acquainted with the properties of the plant. He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know. God made it to grow here in  Kusaie in the days that were dark&rdquo; (heathenism) &ldquo;and when we were a young  people. A wise man from Germany was here ten years ago, and he told us that the  people of Ponap&eacute;, far to the west, use the <i>oap</i> even as we use it, but  that in Ponap&eacute; the plant grows larger and is more juicy than it is here.&rdquo; *</p>
<p class="note">* The &ldquo;wise man from Germany,&rdquo; I ascertained a year or two afterwards, was the well-known J. S.  Kubary, a gentleman who, although engaged in trading pursuits, yet enriched science  by his writings on his discoveries in Micronesia.</p>
<p>Early on the following morning, when the tide  was falling, and the jagged pinnacles of coral rock began to show on the  barrier reef opposite the village, the entire population&mdash;about sixty all  told&mdash;were awaiting Kusis and myself outside his house. The men carried small,  unbarbed fish-spears, the women and children baskets and bundles of <i>oap</i>.</p>
<p>From the village to the reef was a distance of  two miles, which we soon covered by smart paddling in a dozen or more canoes;  for had we delayed we should, through the falling tide, have been obliged to  leave our stranded crafts on the sand, half-way, and walk the remainder.</p>
<p>I need not here attempt to describe the  wondrous beauties of a South Sea coral reef at low tide&mdash;they have been fully  and ably written about by many distinguished travellers&mdash;but the barrier reef of  Strong&rsquo;s Island is so different in its formation from those of most other  islands in the Pacific, that I must, as relative illustration to this account  of the fishing by <i>oap</i> mention its peculiarity.</p>
<p>Instead of the small clefts, chasms, and pools  which so frequently occur on the barrier reefs of the mountainous islands of  Polynesia and Melanesia, and which at low tide are untenanted except by the  smallest varieties of rock-fish, here were a series of deep, almost circular,  miniature lakes, set in a solid wall of coral rock with an overlapping edge,  which made the depth appear greater than it was, especially when one stood on  the edge and looked down to the bottom, four to six fathoms below.</p>
<p>In all of these deep pools were great numbers  or fish of many varieties, size, and colour; some swimming to and fro or  resting upon the sandy bottom, others moving upwards and then downwards in the  clear water with lazy sweep of tail and fin. One variety of the leather-jacket  tribe was very plentiful, and their great size was excelled only by their  remarkable ugliness; their ground colour was a sombre black, traversed by three  broad bands of dull yellow. Some of the largest of these fish weighed quite up  to 20 lbs., and were valued by the natives for their delicacy of flavour. They  would always take a hook, but the Strong&rsquo;s Islanders seldom attempted to  capture them in this manner, for their enormous, hard, sharp, and human-like  teeth played havoc with an ordinary fish-hook, which, if smaller than a  salmon-hook, they would snap in pieces, and as their mouths are very small (in  fact the leather-jacket&rsquo;s mouth is ridiculous when compared to its bulk),  larger and stronger hooks could not be used.</p>
<p>Another and smaller variety were of a brilliant  light blue, with vivid scarlet-tipped fins and tail, a perfectly defined circle  of the same colour round the eyes, and protruding teeth of a dull red. These we  especially detested for their villainous habit of calmly swimming up to a  pendant line, and nipping it in twain, apparently out of sheer humour. Well  have the Samoans named the leather-jacket <i>Isu&rsquo;umu Moana</i>&mdash;the sea-rat.</p>
<p>In one or two of the deeper pools were red,  bream-shaped fish that I had in vain tried to catch with a hook, using every  possible kind of bait; but the natives assured me that I was only wasting my  time, as they fed only upon a long thread-like worm, which lived in the coral,  and that a spear or the <i>oap</i> was the only way of capturing them. So far I  had never actually handled one, but on this occasion we secured some dozens.  Here and there we caught sight of a young hawk-bill turtle darting out of sight  under the ledge of the overhanging walls of coral, putting to flight thousands  of small fish of a score of shapes and colours.</p>
<p>We waited until the tide had fallen still  lower and until the whole surface of the great sweeping curve of reef stood  out, bare and steaming, under the bright tropic sun. Westward lay the ocean,  blue and smooth as a mill pond, with only a gentle, heaving swell laving the  outer wall of the coral barrier. Here and there upon its surface communities of  snowy white terns hovered and fluttered, feeding upon small fish, or examining  floating weed for tiny red and black crabs no bigger than a pea. Eastward and  across the now shallowed water of the lagoon was our village of Leass&eacute;, the  russet-hued, saddle-backed houses of thatch peeping out from the coco-palms and  breadfruit-trees; beyond, the broken, rugged outline of the towering mountain  range, garmented from base to summit with God&rsquo;s mantle of living green;  overhead a sky of wondrous, un-specked blue.</p>
<p>We were all sitting on the rocks, on the  margin of the best and largest pool, smoking and chatting, when at a sign from  Kusis, who was the head man (or local chief) of the village, the women took  their bundles of <i>oap</i> and laying the plants upon smooth portions of the  reef began to pound them with round, heavy stones, brought from the village for  the purpose. As each bundle was crushed and the sticky white juice exuded, it  was rolled into a ball, used like a sponge to wipe up and absorb all the liquid  that had escaped, and then handed to the men and boys, who leapt into the pool,  and dived to the bottom, thrusting the balls of <i>oap</i> underneath every  lower ledge and crevice, and then rising quickly to the surface and clambering  out again. In less than five minutes the once crystal water had changed to a  pale milky white, thousands upon thousands of tiny fish, about half an inch in  length, and of many hues, began to rise to the surface; then others of a larger  size, which the women at once scooped up with small nets; then presently, with  much splashing and floundering, two or three of the handsome red fish I have  described, with a great leather-jacket, came up, and, lying on their sides,  flapped helplessly on the surface. Other kinds, of the mullet species, came  with them, trying to swim upright, but always falling over on their sides, and  yet endeavouring to lift their heads above the water, as if gasping for air.  Then more big leather-jackets, some of which shot up from below as if they had  been fired from a mortar, and, running head-on to the rocky wall of the pool,  allowed themselves to be lifted out without a struggle. It was most exciting  and intensely interesting to witness.</p>
<p>Presently up came a half-grown hawkbill  turtle, his poor head erect and swaying from side to side; a boy leapt in and,  seizing it by its flippers, pushed it up to some women, who quickly carried the  creature to a small pool near by, where it was placed to recover from the  effects of the <i>oap</i> and then be taken ashore to the village turtle-dock  to grow and fatten for killing. (The &ldquo;turtle-dock,&rdquo; I must explain, was a  walled-in enclosure&mdash;partly natural, partly artificial&mdash;situated in a shallow  part of the lagoon, wherein the Leass&eacute; people confined those turtle that they  could not at once eat; sometimes as many as thirty were thus imprisoned and fed  daily.)</p>
<p>Out of this one pool&mdash;which I think was not  more than fifteen yards across&mdash;we obtained many hundredweights of fish and  three turtle. All fish which were too small to be eaten were thrown into other  pools to recover from the effects of the <i>oap</i>. The very smallest,  however, did not recover, and were left to float on the surface and become the  prey of large fish when the incoming tide again covered the reef.</p>
<p>I must here relate an incident that now  occurred, and which will serve to illustrate the resourcefulness and surgical  knowledge of a race of people who, had they met them, Darwin, Huxley and Frank  Buckland would have delighted in and made known to the world. I shall describe  it as briefly and as clearly as possible.</p>
<p>I had brought with me a knife&mdash;a heavy,  broad-backed, keen-edged weapon, which the Chinese carpenter of our wrecked  ship had fashioned out for me from a flat twelve-inch file of Sheffield steel,  and Kusis had, later on, made me a wooden sheath for it. In my excitement at  seeing a large fish rise to the surface I used it as a spear, and then, the  fish secured, had thrown the knife carelessly down. It fell edge upwards in a  cleft of the coral rock, and Kini&eacute;, the pretty twelve-year-old daughter of  Kusis, treading upon it, cut her left foot to the bone. Her father and myself  sprang to her aid, and whilst I was tying the one handkerchief I possessed  tightly round her leg below the knee so as to stay the terrible flow of blood,  he rapidly skinned a large leather jacket by the simple process of cutting  through the skin around the head and shoulders and then dragging it off the  body by holding the upper edge between his teeth and then with both hands  pulling it downwards to the tail. In less than five minutes the sheet of tough  fish-skin was deftly and tightly wrapped round the child&rsquo;s foot, the  handkerchief taken off and replaced by a coir fibre fishing-line, wound round  and round below and above the knee. The agony this caused the poor child made  her faint, but her father knew what he was about when he ordered two of the  women to carry her ashore, take off the covering of fish-skin, cover the foot  with wood-ashes, and bind it up again. This was done, and when we returned to  the village an hour or two later I found the girl seated in her father&rsquo;s house  with her injured foot bandaged in a way that would have reflected credit on a  M.R.C.S.</p>
<p>After exploiting the large pool we turned our  attention to some of those which were wider, but comparatively shallow; and in  these, the bottoms of which were sandy, we obtained some hundreds of mullet and  gar-fish, which were quickly overpowered by the <i>oaf</i> juice. In all I  think that we carried back to the village quite five hundredweight of fish,  some of which were very large: the weight of three of the large banded  leather-jackets I estimated at fifty pounds.</p>
<p>In after years, in other islands of the  Pacific, when I saw the fearful and needless havoc created by traders and  natives using vile dynamite cartridges and so destroying thousands of young  fish by one explosion, I tried hard to get them to use either the <i>futu</i> nut or the <i>oap</i> plant, both of which under many names are known to the  various peoples of Eastern Polynesia.</p>
<p>But the use of dynamite has an attractive  element of danger; it is more sudden and destructive in its effect; it makes a  noise and churns up and agitates the water; its violent concussion breaks and  smashes the submarine coral forest into which it is thrown; and its terrific  shock kills and mutilates hundreds of fish, which, through their bladders  bursting, sink and are not recovered.</p>
<p>Only a few years ago an old and valued  American friend of mine&mdash;an ex-ship captain settled in the Gilbert Islands in  the North Pacific&mdash;became annoyed at what he deemed to be the excessive prices  the natives charged for fish. The &ldquo;excessive price,&rdquo; I may mention, meant that  he was asked a half-dollar for a basket of fish weighing, say, fifty or sixty  pounds. A half-a-dollar is equal to an English florin; but no coin was handed  over&mdash;four sticks of tobacco costing the trader about ten cents, was the  equivalent. So my friend decided to show the natives that he could do without  them as far as his fish supply went. He bought a box of dynamite, with fuse and  caps, from a German trading schooner, and at once set to work, blowing off his  right hand within twenty-four hours, through using too short a fuse.</p>
<p>That wretched box of dynamite proved a curse  to the island. The natives, despite my friend&rsquo;s accident, bought every  cartridge from him, singly or in lots, and they then began to enjoy themselves.  Every hour of the day for many weeks afterwards the sullen thud of the  explosive could be heard from all parts of the lagoon, followed by applauding  shouts. Vast numbers of fish were blown to pieces, for no native would ever  think of dividing a cartridge into half a dozen portions and using only one at  a time; the entire 6-oz. cartridge was used, and sometimes so short were the  fuses, that explosions would take place on the surface, to the delight of the  children, who said, &ldquo;it was as good to hear as the cannons of a man-of-war.&rdquo; In  the short space of eight weeks there were five serious accidents, two of which  ended fatally. I was thankful when the last charge had been exploded, and  although the natives begged me to import a fresh supply, I always declined&mdash;not  on their account only, but because of the wanton destruction of fish involved.</p>
<p>One day I decided to try and ascertain if <i>oap</i> would affect fish by being swallowed. I prepared twenty or thirty small balls  of the plant, wrapped each one up carefully in thin strips of fish flesh, so as  to thoroughly conceal the contents, and took them out to the &ldquo;turtle dock.&rdquo; The  dock, although it was a safe enclosure for turtle, yet had many small passages  through the coral rock which permitted the ingress and exit of moderately-sized  fish, particularly a variety of black and red-spotted rock-cod.</p>
<p>Throwing in the balls, one by one, I watched.  Three of them were at once swallowed by a lively young hawk-bill turtle, and  the remainder were soon seized by some yellow eels and rock-cod, before the  larger and slower-moving turtle (of which there were about twenty in the dock)  discerned them. I waited about on the reef in the vicinity for quite three  hours or more, returning to the pool at intervals and examining the condition  of its occupants. But, at the end of that time, the <i>oap</i> had apparently  taken no effect, and, as night was near, I returned to the village.</p>
<p>On the following morning, I again went to the  &ldquo;dock,&rdquo; lowered my line, and caught six rock-cod. In the stomachs of two I  found the undigested fibres of the <i>oap</i> which, through expansion, they  had been unable to dislodge; but that it had not had any effect on them I was  sure, for these two fish were as strong and vigorous when hooked as were the  four others in whose stomachs there was no sign of <i>oap</i>.</p>
<p>The young hawkbill turtle, however, was  floating on the surface, and seemed very sick.</p>
<p>Here is a point for ichthyologists. Are the  digestive arrangements of a turtle more delicate than those of a fish?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to have no privacy at all?&rdquo; demanded the  Governor irritably as the orderly again tapped at the open door and announced  another visitor. &ldquo;Who is he and what does he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Corwell, your Excellency, master of the  cutter <i>Ceres</i>, from the South Seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor&rsquo;s brows relaxed somewhat. &ldquo;Let  him come in in ten minutes, Cleary, but tell him at the same time that I am  very tired&mdash;too tired to listen unless he has something of importance to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day had indeed been a most tiring one to  the worthy Governor of the colony of New South Wales, just then struggling  weakly in its infancy, and only emerging from the horrors of actual starvation,  caused by the utter neglect of the Home authorities to send out further supplies  of provisions. Prisoners of both sexes came in plenty, but brought nothing to  eat with them; the military officers who should have helped him in his arduous  labours were secretly plotting against him, and their spare time&mdash;and they had  plenty&mdash;was devoted to writing letters home to highly-placed personages  imploring them to induce the Government to break up the settlement and not  &ldquo;waste the health and lives of even these abandoned convicts in trying to found  a colony in the most awful and hideous desert the eye of man had ever seen, a  place which can never be useful to man and is accursed by God.&rdquo; But the  Governor took no heed. Mutiny and discontent he had fought in his silent,  determined way as he fought grim famine, sparing himself nothing, toiling from  dawn till dark, listening to complaints, remedying abuses, punishing with swift  severity those who deserved it, and yet always preserving the same cold,  unbending dignity of manner which covered a highly-sensitive and deeply  sympathetic nature.</p>
<p>But on this particular day, fatigue, the  intense heat, which had prevailed, a violent quarrel between the intriguing  major commanding the marines, and many other lesser worries, had been almost  more than he could bear, so it may well be imagined that he was more inclined  for rest than talk.</p>
<p>Ten, twenty minutes, and then the thin, spare  figure raised itself wearily from the rude sofa. He must see his visitor. He  had promised to do so, and the sooner it was over the better. He called to the  orderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mr.&mdash;Corwell you said?&mdash;to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heavy step sounded on the bare floor, and  one of the finest specimens of manhood Governor Arthur Phillip had ever seen in  all his long naval career stood before him and saluted. There was something so  pleasant and yet so manly in the handsome, cleanshaven and deeply-bronzed face,  that the Governor was at once attracted to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, Mr. Corwell,&rdquo; he said in his low,  yet clear tones. &ldquo;I am very tired, so you must not keep me long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, your Excellency. But I thought,  sir, that you would prefer to hear the report of my voyage personally. I have  discovered a magnificent harbour north of the Solomon Islands, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! And so you came to me. Very sensible,  very sensible of you. I am obliged to you, sir. Tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Excellency; but I regret I  have intruded on you this evening. Perhaps, sir, you will permit me to call  again to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not at all,&rdquo; was the energetic reply.  &ldquo;I am always ready to hear anything of this nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that, sir, for the masters of the <i>Breckenbridge</i> and another transport told me that you were most anxious to learn of any  discoveries in the Pacific Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, sir. I am looking forward to hear  from them and from the masters of other transports which I am inducing to  follow the whale fishery on their return voyage to England <i>via</i> Batavia.  But so far I have heard nothing from any one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged and pleased at the Governor&rsquo;s  manner, the master of the <i>Ceres</i> at once produced a roughly executed plan  and a detailed written description of the harbour, which, he asserted with  confidence, was one of the finest in that part of the Pacific. A broad, deep  stream of water ran from the lofty range of mountains which traversed the  island north and south and fell into a spacious bay, on the shores of which was  a large and populous native village, whose inhabitants had treated Corwell and  the few men of his ship&rsquo;s company with considerable kindness, furnishing them  not only with wood and water, but an ample supply of fresh provisions as well.</p>
<p>During the two weeks that the <i>Ceres</i> lay  at anchor, Corwell and two or three of his hands unhesitatingly trusted  themselves among the natives, who escorted them inland and around the coast.  Everywhere was evidence of the extraordinary fertility of the island, which, in  the vicinity of the seashore, was highly cultivated, each family&rsquo;s plantation  being enclosed by stone fences, while their houses were strongly built and  neatly constructed. The broad belt of the slopes of the mountains were covered  with magnificent timber, which Corwell believed to be teak, equal in quality to  any he had seen in the East Indies, and which he said could be easily brought  down to the seashore for shipment owing to there being several other large streams  beside the one on whose banks the principal village was built.</p>
<p>The Governor was much interested, and  complimented the young seaman on the manner in which he had written out his  description of the place and his observations on the character and customs of  the inhabitants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such information as you have given me, Mr.  Corwell, is always valuable, and I give you my best thanks. I wish I could do  more; and had I the means, men, and money to spare I should send a vessel there  and to other islands in the vicinity to make further examination, for I believe  that from those islands to the northward we can obtain invaluable food supplies  in the future. The winds are more favourable for making a quick voyage there  and back than they are to those groups to the eastward; but,&rdquo; and here he  sighed, &ldquo;our condition is such that I fear it will be many years ere His  Majesty will consent to such an undertaking. But much may be done at private  cost&mdash;perhaps in the near future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man remained silent for a moment or  two; then with some hesitation he said, as he took a small paper packet from  his coat pocket and handed it to the Governor, &ldquo;Will your Excellency look at  this and tell me what it is. I&mdash;I imagine it is pure gold, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold, gold!&rdquo; and something like a frown  contracted the Governor&rsquo;s pale brows; &ldquo;ever since the settlement was formed I&rsquo;ve  been pestered with tales of gold, and a pretty expense it has run me into  sending parties out to search for it. Why, only six months ago a rascally  prisoner gulled one of my officers into letting him lead an expedition into the  bush&mdash;the fellow had filed down a brass bolt&mdash;&rdquo; he looked up and caught sight of  the dark flush which had suddenly suffused his visitor&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;but I do not for  a moment imagine you are playing upon my credulity, Mr. Corwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He untied the string and opened the packet,  and in an instant an exclamation of astonishment and pleasure escaped as he saw  that the folds of paper held quite three ounces of bright and flaky water-worn  gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This certainly <i>is</i> gold, sir. May I ask  where you obtained it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made the voyage to Sydney Cove to tell your  Excellency of two discoveries&mdash;one was of the fine harbour, the other was of  this gold, which my wife (who is a native of Ternate) and myself ourselves  washed out of the bed of a small stream; the natives helped us, but attached  not the slightest value to our discovery. In fact, sir, they assured us as well  as they could that much more was to be had in every river on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife was it, then, or yourself, who first  recognised what it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did, sir. She has seen much of it in the  hands of the Bugis and Arab traders in her native country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor moved his slender forefinger to  and fro amid the shining, heavy particles, then he pondered deeply for some  minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me frankly, Mr. Corwell&mdash;why did you make  a long voyage to this settlement to tell <i>me</i> of your discovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hope, sir, that you would advise and  perhaps assist me. My crew are Malays and Chinese and would have murdered me if  they knew what I knew. Will your Excellency tell me the proper course to pursue  so that I may be protected in my discovery? I am a poor man, though my ship is  my own, but she is old and leaky and must undergo heavy repairs before she  leaves Sydney Cove again; my present crew I wish to replace by half a dozen  respectable Englishmen, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor shook his head. &ldquo;I will do all I  can to help you, but I cannot provide you with men. The island which you have  visited may have been discovered and taken possession of by France, two of  whose exploring ships were in these seas a few years ago, and even if that is  not the case I could not take possession of them for His Majesty, as I have no  commissioned officer to spare to undertake such a duty. Yet, if such an officer  were available, Mr. Corwell, I would be strongly tempted to send him with you,  hoist the British flag, and then urge the Home Government to confirm my action  and secure to you the right, subject to the King&rsquo;s royalties, to work these  gold deposits. But I am powerless&mdash;much as I wish to aid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of disappointment clouded the young  captain&rsquo;s handsome features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would your Excellency permit me to endeavour  to find three or four seamen myself? There is a transport ready to sail for  England, and I may be able to get some men from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Unless you revealed the object of  your voyage&mdash;which would be exceedingly foolish of you&mdash;you could not induce them  to make a voyage in such a small vessel as yours to islands inhabited mostly by  ferocious savages. But this much I can and will do for you. I will direct  Captain Hunter of the <i>Sirius</i>, the only King&rsquo;s ship I have here, to set  his carpenters to work on your vessel as soon as ever you careen her; I will  supply you at my own private cost with arms and ammunition and a new suit of  sails. Provisions I cannot give you&mdash;God knows we want them badly enough  ourselves, although we are not now in such a bad plight as we were ten months  ago. Yet for all that I may be able to get you a cask or two of beef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is most generous of you, sir. I will  not, however, take the beef, your Excellency. But for the sails and the repairs  to my poor little vessel I thank you, sir, most heartily and sincerely. And I  pledge you my word of honour, as well as giving you my written bond, that I  will redeem my obligations to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you fail I shall be content, for I  well know that it will be no fault of yours. But stay, Mr. Corwell; I must have  one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too must pledge me your honour that you  will not reveal the secret of your discovery of gold to any one in the  settlement. This I do not demand&mdash;I ask it as a favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Governor took him, guardedly enough,  into his confidence. With a thousand convicts, most of them utter ruffians,  guarded by a scanty force or marines, the news of gold having been found would,  he was sure, have a disastrous effect, and lead to open revolt. The few small  merchant ships which were in port were partly manned by convict seamen, and  there was every likelihood of them being seized by gangs of desperate  criminals, fired with the idea of reaching the golden island. Already a party  of convicts had escaped with the mad idea of walking to China, which they  believed was only separated from Australia by a large river which existed a few  hundred miles to the northward of the settlement. Some of them died of thirst,  others were slaughtered by the blacks, and the wounded and exhausted survivors  were glad to make their way back again to their gaolers.</p>
<p>Corwell listened intently, and gave his  promise readily. Then he rose to go, and the Governor held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Corwell. I must see you  again before you sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>II</b></h3>
<p>One evening, three weeks later&mdash;so vigorously  had the carpenter&rsquo;s mates from the old frigate <i>Sirius</i> got through their  work&mdash;the <i>Ceres</i> was ready for sea. She was to sail on the following  morning, and Corwell, having just returned from the shore, where he had been to  say goodbye to the kind-hearted Governor, was pacing the deck with his wife,  his smiling face and eager tones showing that he was well pleased.</p>
<p>He had reason to be pleased, for unusual luck  had attended him. Not only had his ship been thoroughly and efficiently  repaired, but he had replaced six of his untrustworthy Malays by four good,  sturdy British seamen, one of whom he had appointed mate. These men had arrived  at Sydney Cove in a transport a few days after his interview with the Governor;  the transport had been condemned, and Corwell, much to his delight, found that  out of her crew of thirty, four were willing to come with him on what he  cautiously described as a &ldquo;voyage of venture to the South Seas.&rdquo; All of them  had served in the navy, and the captain of the transport and his officers gave  them excellent characters for sobriety and seamanship. Out of the sixty or  seventy pounds which still remained to him he had given them a substantial  advance, and the cheerful manner in which they turned to and helped the  carpenters from the frigate convinced him that he had secured decent, reliable  men, to whom he thought he could reveal the real object of his voyage later on.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Two years before Corwell had been mate of a  &ldquo;country&rdquo; ship employed in trading between Calcutta and the Moluccas. The  Ternate agent of the owners of the ship was an Englishman named Leighton, a  widower with one daughter, whose mother had died when the girl was fifteen.  With this man the young officer struck up a friendship, and before six months  had passed he was the acknowledged suitor of Mary Leighton, with whom he had fallen  in love at first sight, and who quickly responded to his affection. She was  then twenty-two years of age, tall and fair, with dark hazel eyes, like her  English mother, and possessed of such indomitable spirit and courage that her  father often laughingly declared it was she, and not he, who really managed the  business which he controlled.</p>
<p>And she really did much to help him; she knew  his weak, vacillating, and speculative nature would long since have left them  penniless had he not yielded to her advice and protests on many occasions,  Generous and extravagantly hospitable, he spent his money lavishly, and had  squandered two or three fortunes in wild business ventures in the Indian Seas  instead of saving one. Latterly, however, he had been more careful, and when  Corwell had made his acquaintance he had two vessels&mdash;a barque and a brig&mdash;both  of which were very profitably engaged in the Manila-China trade, and he was now  sanguine or mending his broken fortunes.</p>
<p>Isolated as were father and daughter from the  advantages of constant intercourse with European society, the duty of educating  the girl was a task of love to her remaining parent, who, before he entered  &ldquo;John Company&rsquo;s&rdquo; service, had travelled much in Europe. Yet, devoted as he was  to her, and looking forward with some dread to the coming loneliness of life  which would be his when she married, he cheerfully gave his consent to her  union with John Corwell, for whom he had conceived a strong liking, and who, he  knew, would make her a good husband.</p>
<p>They were married at Batavia, to which port  they were accompanied by Mr. Leighton, who, during the voyage, had pressed  Corwell to leave his then employment and join him in a venture which had  occupied his mind for the past year. This was to despatch either the barque or  brig, laden with trade goods, to the Society Islands in the South Pacific, to  barter for coconut oil and pearl shell.</p>
<p>Leighton was certain that there was a fortune  awaiting the man who entered upon the venture, and his arguments so convinced  the young man that he consented.</p>
<p>On arrival at Batavia they found there the  officers and crew of a shipwrecked English vessel, and one of the former  eagerly took Corwell&rsquo;s place as chief mate, his captain offering no objection.  A few weeks after Mr. Leighton hired the <i>Ceres</i> to take himself, his  daughter, and her husband back to Ternate, eager to begin the work of fitting  out one of his vessels for the voyage that was to bring them fortune. He, it  was arranged, was to remain at Ternate, Mary was to sail with her husband to  the South Seas.</p>
<p>But a terrible shock awaited them. As the <i>Ceres</i> sailed up to her anchorage before Mr. Leighton&rsquo;s house, his Chinese clerk came  on board with the news that the barque had foundered in a typhoon, and the brig  had been plundered and burnt by pirates within a few miles of Canton. The  unfortunate man gave one last appealing look at his daughter and then fell on  the deck at her feet He never spoke again, and died in a few hours. When his  affairs came to be settled up, it was found that, after paying his debts, there  was less than four hundred pounds left&mdash;a sum little more than that which  Corwell had managed to save out of his own wages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Jack,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis little  enough, but yet &rsquo;tis enough. And, Jack, let us go away from here. I should not  care now to meet any of the people father knew in his prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corwell kissed his wife, and then they at once  discussed the future. Half an hour later he had bought the <i>Ceres</i> from  her captain (who was also the owner), paid him his money and taken possession.  Before the week was out he had bought all the trade goods he could afford to  pay for, shipped a crew of Malays and Chinese, and, with Mary by his side,  watched Ternate sink astern as the <i>Ceres</i> began her long voyage to the  South Seas.</p>
<p>After a three weeks&rsquo; voyage along the northern  and eastern shores of New Guinea the <i>Ceres</i> came to an anchor in the  harbour which Corwell had described to the Governor. The rest of his story, up  to the time of his arrival in Sydney Cove, the reader knows</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Steadily northward under cloudless skies the  high-pooped, bluff-bowed little vessel had sailed, favoured by leading winds  nearly all the way, for four-and-twenty days, when, on the morning of the  twenty-fifth, Corwell, who had been up aloft scanning the blue loom of a lofty  island which lay right ahead, descended to the deck with a smiling face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not only the island itself, Mary, but  with this breeze we have a clear run for the big village in the bay; I can see  the spur on the southern side quite clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad, Jack, dear. And how you have  worried and fumed for the past three days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feared we had got too far to the westward,  my girl,&rdquo; he said. Then telling the mate to keep away a couple of points, he  went below to pore over the plan of the harbour, a copy of which had been taken  by the Governor, As he studied it his wife&rsquo;s fingers passed lovingly through  and through his curly locks. He looked up, put his arm around her waist, and  swung her to a seat on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Mary, I can tell the men now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can! The sooner you take them  into your confidence the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corwell nodded. During the voyage he had  watched the mate and three white seamen keenly, and was thoroughly satisfied  with them. The remainder of the crew&mdash;three Manila men and two Penang Malays&mdash;did  their duty well enough, but both he and his wife knew from long experience that  such people were not to be trusted when their avarice was aroused. He resolved,  therefore, to rely entirely upon his white crew and the natives of the island  to help him in obtaining the gold. Yet, as he could not possibly keep the  operations a secret from the five men he distrusted, he decided, as a safeguard  against their possible and dangerous ill-will, to promise them double wages  from the day he found that gold was to be obtained in payable quantities. As  for the mate and three other white men, they should have one-fifth of all the  gold won between them, he keeping the remaining four-fifths for himself and  wife.</p>
<p>He put his head up the companion-way and  called to the man whom he had appointed mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come below, Mallett, and bring Totten,  Harris, and Sam with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondering what was the matter the four men  came into the cabin. As soon as they were standing together at the head of the  little table, the captain&rsquo;s wife went quietly on deck to see that none of the  coloured crew came aft to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, men,&rdquo; said Corwell, &ldquo;I have something  important to tell you. I believe I can trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in as few words as possible he told them  the object of the voyage and his intentions towards them. At first they seemed  somewhat incredulous, but when they were shown some of the gold their doubts  vanished, and they one and all swore to be honest and true to him and to obey  him faithfully whether afloat or ashore, in fair or evil fortune.</p>
<p>From his scanty store of liquor the captain  took a bottle of rum, and they drank to their future success; then Corwell  shook each man&rsquo;s hand and sent him on deck.</p>
<p>Just before dusk the <i>Ceres</i> ran in and  dropped her clumsy, wooden-stocked anchor in the crystal-clear water, a few  cables&rsquo; length away from the village. As the natives recognised her a chorus of  welcoming shouts and cries pealed from the shore from five hundred dusky-hued  throats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>III</b></h3>
<p>A blazing, tropic sun shone in mid-heaven upon  the motionless waters of the deep, land-locked bay in which the Ceres lay, with  top-mast struck and awnings spread fore and aft. A quarter of a mile away was  the beach, girdled with its thick belt of coco-palms whose fronds hung limp and  hot in the windless air as if gasping for breath. Here and there, among the  long line of white, lime-washed canoes, drawn up on the sand, snowy white and  blue cranes stalked to and fro seeking for the small thin-shelled soldier crabs  burrowing under the loose <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of leaves and fallen palm-branches to  escape the heat.</p>
<p>A few yards back from the level of high-water  mark clustered the houses of the native village, built on both sides of the  bright, fast-flowing stream which here, as it debouched into the sea, was wide  and shallow, showing a bottom composed of rounded black stones alternating with  rocky bars. Along the grassless banks, worn smooth by the constant tread of  naked feet, grew tall many-hued crotons, planted and carefully tended by their  native owners, and shielded from the rays of the sun by the ever-present  coco-palms. From either side of the bank, looking westward towards the forest,  there was a clear stretch of water half a mile in length, then the river was  hidden from view, for in its course from the mountains through the  heavily-jungled littoral it took many bends and twists, sometimes running  swiftly over rocky, gravelly beds, sometimes flowing noiselessly through deep,  muddy-bottomed pools and dank, steamy swamps, the haunt of the silent, dreaded  alligator.</p>
<p>At the head of the straight stretch of water  of which I have spoken there was on the left-hand bank of the river an open  grassy sward, surrounded by clumps of areca and coco-palms, and in the centre  stood a large house, built by native hands, but showing by various external  signs that it was tenanted by people other than the wild inhabitants of the  island. Just in front of the house, and surrounded by a number of canoes, the  boat belonging to the <i>Ceres</i> was moored to the bank, and under a long  open-sided, palm-thatched shed, were a number of brown-skinned naked savages,  some lying sleeping, others squatting on their hams, energetically chewing  betel nut.</p>
<p>As they talked and chewed and spat out the  scarlet juice through their hideous red lips and coaly black teeth, a canoe,  paddled by two natives and steered by Mallet, the mate of the <i>Ceres</i>,  came up the river. The instant it was seen a chorus of yells arose from the  natives in the long hut, and Mary Corwell came to the open doorway of the house  and looked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, wake up, Jack!&rdquo; she cried, turning  her face inwards over her graceful shoulder, &ldquo;here is Mallet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice awoke her husband, who in an instant  sprang from his couch and joined her, just as Mallet&mdash;a short, square-built man  of fifty&mdash;stepped out of the canoe and walked briskly towards them, wiping his  broad, honest face with a blue cotton handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come inside, Mallet. &rsquo;Tis a bit cooler in  here. I&rsquo;m sorry I sent you down to the ship on such a day as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mallet laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mind  it, sir, though &rsquo;tis a powerful hot day, and the natives are all lying asleep  in their huts; they can&rsquo;t understand why us works as we do in the sun. Lord,  sir! How I should like to see old Kingsdown and Walmer Castle to-day, all  a-white with snow. I was born at Deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Corwell brought the old seaman a young  coconut to drink, and her husband added a little rum; Mallet tossed it off and  then sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, the ship is all right, and those  chaps aboard seem content enough. But I&rsquo;m afeared that the worms are a-getting  into her although she is moored right abreast of the river. So I took it on me  to tell Totten and Harris to stay aboard whilst I came back to ask you if it  wouldn&rsquo;t be best for us to bring her right in to the fresh water, and moor her  here, right abreast o&rsquo; the house. That&rsquo;ll kill any worms as has got into her  timbers. And we can tow her in the day after to-morrow, when there will be a  big tide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did quite right, Mallet. Very likely the  worms have got into her timbers in spite of her being abreast of the river&rsquo;s  mouth. I should have thought of this before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jack,&rdquo; said his wife, with a smile, &ldquo;we  have thought too much of our gold-getting and too little of the poor old <i>Ceres</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall think more of her now, Mary.  And as the rains will be on us in a few days&mdash;so the natives say&mdash;and we can do  no more work for three months, I think it will be as well for us to sail the <i>Ceres</i> over to that chain of lagoon islands about thirty miles from here. I fear to  remain here during the wet season, on account of the fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After further discussion it was decided that  Jack and Mallet, with some natives, should make an early start in the morning  for their mining camp, six miles away, at the foot of the range, and do a long,  last day&rsquo;s work, returning to the house on the following day. Meanwhile a  message was to be sent to Harris and Totten to bring the vessel into the creek  as soon as the tide served, which would be in forty-eight hours. Then, whilst  she lay for a week in the fresh water, so as to kill the suspected <i>teredo  navalis</i> worms, which Mallet feared had attacked her, she was to be made  ready for the short voyage of thirty miles over to a cluster of islands  enclosing a spacious lagoon, where Corwell intended to beach her till the rainy  season was over, when he would return to work a very promising stream in  another locality. Already he and his men, aided by the natives, had, in the  four months that had passed since they arrived, won nearly five hundred ounces  of gold, crude as were their appliances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;I think that, as you  will be away all day and night, to-morrow I shall go on board and see what I  can do. I&rsquo;ll make the men turn to and give the cabin a thorough overhauling.  Marawa, the chiefs wife, has given me a lot of sleeping-mats, and I shall throw  those old horrible flock mattresses overboard, and we shall have nice clean  mats instead to lie on.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>At daylight Mallet aroused the natives who  were to accompany him and the captain, and then told off two of them to make  the boat ready for Mrs. Corwell. Then he returned to the house and called out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat is ready, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I, Mallet,&rdquo; replied Mary, tying on her  old-fashioned sun-hood. Then she turned to her husband. &ldquo;Jack, darling, this  will be the very first time in our married life that I have ever slept away  from you, and it shall be the last, too. But I <i>do</i> want to surprise you  when you see our cabin again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her lips up to him and kissed him half  a dozen times. &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s a good-night and good morning three times over.  Now I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corwell and Mallet walked down to the boat  with her and saw her get in. She kissed her hand to them and in a few minutes  was out of sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>IV</b></h3>
<p>A light, cool breeze, which had set in at  daylight, was blowing when Mary Corwell boarded the <i>Ceres</i>. Totten and  Harris met her at the gangway, caps in hand. Poor Sam, their former shipmate,  had died of fever a month before. They were delighted to hear that she intended  to remain on board, and Harris at once told Miguel, the scoundrelly-faced  Manila cook, to get breakfast ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you must have your breakfast with me,&rdquo;  said Mary, &ldquo;and after that you must obey <i>my</i> orders. I am to be captain  to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>As she and the two seamen sat aft under the  awning, at their breakfast, Selak, the leading Malay, and his fellows squatted  on the fore-hatch and talked in whispers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell thee,&rdquo; said Selak, &ldquo;that I have seen  it. On the evening of the day when the man Sam died and was buried, I was  sitting outside the house. It was dark, and the Tuan Korwal thought I had  returned to the ship. I crept near and listened. They were speaking of what  should be done with the dead man&rsquo;s share of the gold. Then I looked through the  cave side of the house, and&mdash;dost remember that white basin of thine, Miguel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manila man nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white woman, at a sign from her husband,  went into the inner room and brought it out and placed it on the table. It was  full to the brim with gold! and there was more in a bag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His listeners drew nearer to him, their dark  eyes gleaming with avarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Tuan said, &lsquo;None of Sam&rsquo;s gold will  I or my wife touch. Let it be divided among you three. It is but fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talked again, and then Mallet said to  the Tuan, &lsquo;Captain, it shall be as you wish. But let it all go together till  the time comes for thee to give us our share.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched the white woman take the basin and  the bag, put them into a box, and place the box in a hole in the ground in her  sleeping-room. Then I came away, for my heart was on fire with the wrong that  hath been done to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose to his feet and peered round the  corner of the galley. Mary and the two seamen were eating very leisurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of them are here now and will sleep aboard  to-night. God hath given them into our hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of the other two?&mdash;they are strong  men,&rdquo; asked a wizen, monkey-faced Malay, nicknamed Nakoda (the captain).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! What is a giant if he sleeps and a kriss  is swept across his throat, or a spear is thrust into his back from behind?  They, too, shall die as quickly as these who sit near us. Now listen. But sit  thou out on the deck, Miguel, so that thou canst warn us if either of those  accursed dogs approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook obeyed him silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This</i> it is to be. To-night these three  here shall die in their sleep, silently and without a sound. Then we, all but  thou, Nakoda, shall take the boat and go to the house. Both the Tuan and Mallet  sleep heavily, and&rdquo;&mdash;he drew his hand swiftly across his tawny throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; queried Nakoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the gold&mdash;the gold, or our share of  which we have been robbed&mdash;is ours, and the ship is ours, and I, Selak, will  guide ye all to Dobbo in the Aru Islands, where we shall be safe, and become  great men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; muttered another man, &ldquo;what if these  black sons of Shaitan here of the Island turn upon us after we have slain the  white men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selak laughed scornfully. &ldquo;The sound of a gun  terrifies them. They are cowards, and will not seek to interfere with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Night had fallen. The two white seamen, tired  out with their day&rsquo;s work, had spread their mats on the poop, and were sound in  slumber. Below in the cabin, the captain&rsquo;s wife lay reading by the light of a  lamp; and Selak, standing in the waist, could see its faint reflection shining  through the cabin door, which opened on to the main deck. Sitting on the  fore-deck, with their hands clutching their knives, his companions watched him.</p>
<p>At last the light was lowered, and Mary closed  her eyes and slept.</p>
<p>The Malay waited patiently. One by one the  remaining native fires on the shore went out; and, presently, a chill gust of  air swept down from the mountains, and looking shoreward he saw that the sky to  the eastward was quickly darkening and hiding the stars&mdash;a heavy downpour of  rain was near.</p>
<p>He drew his kriss from its tortoiseshell  sheath and felt the edge, made a gesture to the crouching tigers for&rsquo;ard, and  then stepped lightly along the deck to the open cabin door; the other four  crept after him, then stopped and waited&mdash;for less than a minute.</p>
<p>A faint, choking cry came from the cabin, and  then Selak came out, his kriss streaming with blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; he whispered, and pointing to  the poop he sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there! what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Totten,  who had heard the feint cry; and then, too late, he drew his pistol from his  belt and fired&mdash;as Selak&rsquo;s kriss plunged into his chest. Poor Harris was  slaughtered ere he had opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Spurning Totten&rsquo;s body with his naked foot,  Selak cursed it. &ldquo;Accursed Christian dog! Would I could bring thee to life so  that I might kill thee again!&rdquo; Then, as he heard the rushing hum of the coming  rain squall, and saw that the shore was hidden from view, as if a solid wall of  white stone had suddenly arisen between it and the ship, he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! what does it matter? Had it been a  cannon instead of a pistol it could scarce have been heard on the shore in such  a din.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ordering the bodies of the two seamen to be  thrown overboard, Selak, the most courageous, entered the cabin, took a couple  of muskets from the rack, and some powder and ball from the mate&rsquo;s berth, and  returning to his followers, bade them bring the boat alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw the woman after them,&rdquo; he cried to  Nakoda, as the boat pushed off into the darkness, just as the hissing rain  began. &ldquo;We shall return ere it is dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nakoda would have sprung over the side after  the boat, but he feared the sharks even more than Selak&rsquo;s kriss; so running for&rsquo;ard,  he crept into his bunk and lay there, too terrified to move.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Mallet and Corwell, with the natives, worked  hard till near sunset, and then ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nearly five ounces in that lot,  Mallet,&rdquo; said the captain, pointing to two buckets of wash-dirt. &ldquo;Let us have a  bathe, and then get something to eat before it is too dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives say we ought to get back to the  house, sir, instead of sleeping here tonight. They say a heavy storm is coming  on, and we&rsquo;ll be washed out of the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mallet I don&rsquo;t want to stay here,  I can assure you. Tell them to hurry up, then. Get the shovels and other gear,  and let us start as quickly as possible. It will take us a good three hours to  get back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By sunset they started, walking in single file  along the narrow, dangerous mountain-path, a false step on which meant a fall  of hundreds of feet.</p>
<p>Half-way down, the storm overtook them, but  guided by the surefooted natives they pressed steadily on, gained the level  ground, and at last reached the house about ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we have come so far we might as well  go on board and give my wife a surprise,&rdquo; said Corwell to Mallet. &ldquo;Look, the  rain is taking off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for long, sir. But if we start at once we  may get aboard afore it starts again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two willing natives, wet and shivering as they  were, quickly baled out a canoe, and in a few minutes they were off, paddling  down towards the sea. But scarce had they gone a few hundred yards when another  sudden downpour of rain blotted out everything around them. But the natives  paddled steadily on amid the deafening roar; the river was wide, and there was  no danger of striking anything harder than the hanging branch of a tree or the  soft banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard voices just now,&rdquo; shouted  Mallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natives been out fishing,&rdquo; replied Corwell.</p>
<p>As the canoe shot out through the mouth of the  river into the open bay the rain ceased as suddenly as it began, and the <i>Ceres</i> loomed up right ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hail them, Mallet. Let us go aboard  quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They clambered up the side, the two natives  following, and, wet and dripping, entered the cabin.</p>
<p>Corwell stepped to the swinging lamp, which  burnt dimly, and pricked up the wick. His wife seemed to be sound asleep on the  cushioned transom locker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;wake up, dearest. We&mdash; &hellip; Oh  my God,Mallet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to her side, and kneeling beside the  still figure, placed his hand on the blood-stained bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! Dead! Murdered!&rdquo; He rose to his feet,  and stared wildly at Mallet, swayed to and fro, and then fell heavily forward.</p>
<p>As the two natives stood at the cabin door, gazing  in wondering horror at the scene, they heard a splash. Nakoda had jumped  overboard and was swimming ashore.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Long before dawn the native war-drums began to  beat, and when Selak and his fellow-murderers reached the mouth of the river  they ran into a fleet of canoes which waited for them. They fought like the  tigers they were, but were soon overcome and made prisoners, tied hand and  foot, and carried ashore to the &ldquo;House of the Young Men.&rdquo; The gold was taken  care of by the chief, who brought it on board to Corwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do these men die?&rdquo; he asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; replied Corwell huskily; &ldquo;to-day,  after I have buried my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a little island just within the barrier  reef, she was laid to rest, with the never-ending cry of the surf for her  requiem.</p>
<p>At sunset, Corwell and Mallet left the ship  and landed at the village, and as their feet touched the sand the war-drums  broke out with deafening clamour. They each carried a cutlass, and walked  quickly through the thronging natives to the &ldquo;House of the Young Men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them out,&rdquo; said Corwell hoarsely to the  chief.</p>
<p>One by one Selak and his fellow-prisoners were  brought out and placed on their feet, the bonds that held them were cut, and  their hands seized and held widely apart. And then Corwell and Mallet thrust  their cutlasses through the cruel hearts.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PoisonousFishOfThePacificIslands"></a>Poisonous Fish Of The Pacific Islands</b></h2>
<p>Many years ago I was sent with a wrecking  party of native seamen to take possession of a Swedish barque which had gone  ashore on the reef of one of the Marshall Islands, in the North Pacific. My  employers, who had bought the vessel for &pound;100, were in hopes that she might  possibly be floated, patched up, and brought to Sydney. However, on arriving at  the island I found that she was hopelessly bilged, so we at once set to work to  strip her of everything of value, especially her copper, which was new. It was  during these operations that I made acquaintance with both poisonous and  stinging fish. There were not more than sixty or seventy natives living on the  island, and some of these, as soon as we anchored in the lagoon, asked me to  caution my own natives&mdash;who came from various other Pacific islands&mdash;not to eat  any fish they might catch in the lagoon until each one had been examined by a  local man. I followed their injunction, and for two or three weeks all went  well; then came trouble.</p>
<p>I had brought down with me from Sydney a white  carpenter&mdash;one of the most obstinate, cross-grained old fellows that ever trod a  deck, but an excellent workman if humoured a little. At his own request he  lived on board the wrecked barque, instead of taking up his quarters on shore  in the native village with the rest of the wrecking party. One evening as I was  returning from the shore to the schooner&mdash;I always slept on board&mdash;I saw the old  man fishing from the waist of the wreck, for it was high tide, and there was  ten feet of water around the ship. I saw him excitedly haul in a good-sized  fish, and, hailing him, inquired how many he had caught, and if he were sure  they were not poisonous? He replied that he had caught five, and that &ldquo;there  was nothin&rsquo; the matter with them.&rdquo; Knowing what a self-willed, ignorant man he  was, I thought I should have a look at the fish and satisfy myself; so I ran  the boat alongside and clambered on board, followed by two of my native crew.  The moment we opened the fishes&rsquo; mouths and looked down their throats we saw  the infallible sign which denoted their highly poisonous condition&mdash;a colouring  of bright orange with thin reddish-brown streaks. The old fellow grumbled  excessively when I told him to throw them overboard, and then somewhat annoyed  me by saying that all the talk about them being unsafe was bunkum. He had, he  said, caught and eaten just the same kind of fish at Vavau, in the Tonga  Islands, time and time again. It was no use arguing with such a creature, so,  after again warning him not to eat any fish of any kind unless the natives  &ldquo;passed&rdquo; them as non-poisonous, I left him and went on board my own vessel.</p>
<p>We had supper rather later than usual that  evening, and, as the mate and myself were smoking on deck about nine o&rsquo;clock,  we heard four shots in rapid succession fired from the wreck. Knowing that  something was wrong, I called a couple of hands, and in a few minutes was  pulled on board, where I found the old carpenter lying writhing in agony, his  features presenting a truly shocking and terrifying appearance. His revolver  lay on the deck near him&mdash;he had fired it to bring assistance. I need not here  describe the peculiarly drastic remedies adopted by the natives to save the man&rsquo;s  life. They at first thought the case was a hopeless one, but by daylight the  patient was out of danger. He was never able to turn to again as long as we  were on the island, and suffered from the effects of the fish for quite two or  three years. He had, he afterwards told me, made up his mind to eat some of the  fish that evening to show me that he was right and I was wrong.</p>
<p>A few weeks after this incident myself and a  native lad named Viri, who was one of our crew and always my companion in  fishing or shooting excursions, went across the lagoon to some low sandy  islets, where we were pretty sure of getting a turtle or two. Viri&rsquo;s father and  mother were Samoans, but he had been born on Nassau Island, a lonely spot in  the South Pacific, where he had lived till he was thirteen years of age. He was  now fifteen, and a smarter, more cheerful, more intelligent native boy I had  never met.</p>
<p>His knowledge of bird and fish life was a  never-ending source of pleasure and instruction to me, and the late Earl of  Pembroke and Sir William Flower would have delighted in him.</p>
<p>It was dead low tide when we reached the  islets, so taking our spears with us we set out along the reef to look for  turtle in the many deep and winding pools which broke up the surface of the  reef. After searching for some time together without success, Viri left me and  went off towards the sea, I keeping to the inner side of the lagoon. Presently  in a shallow pool about ten feet in circumference I espied a small but  exceedingly beautiful fish. It was about four inches in length, and two and a  half inches in depth, and as it kept perfectly still I had time to admire its  brilliant hues&mdash;blue and yellow-banded sides with fins and tail tipped with  vivid crimson spots. Around the eyes were a number of dark yellowish or  orange-coloured rings, and the eyes themselves were large, bright, and staring.  It displayed no alarm at my presence, but presently swam slowly to the side of  the pool and disappeared under the coral ledge. I determined to catch and  examine the creature, and in a few minutes I discovered it resting in such a  position that I could grasp it with my hand. I did so, and seizing it firmly by  the back and belly, whipped it up out of the water, but not before I felt  several sharp pricks from its fins. Holding it so as to study it closely, I  suddenly dropped it in disgust, as strange violent pains shot through my hand.  In another two minutes they had so increased in their intensity that I became  alarmed and shouted to Viri to come back. Certainly not more than five or ten  minutes elapsed before he was with me; to me it seemed ages, for by this time  the pain was excruciating. A look at the fish told him nothing; he had never  seen one like it before. How I managed to get back to the schooner and live  through the next five or six hours of agony I cannot tell. Twice I fainted, and  at times became delirious. The natives could do nothing for me, but said that  the pain would moderate before morning, especially if the fish was dead. Had  its fins struck into my foot instead of my hand I should have died, they asserted;  and then they told the mate and myself that one day a mischievous boy who had  speared one of these abominable fish threw it at a young woman who was standing  some distance away. It struck her on the foot, the spines penetrating a vein,  and the poor girl died in terrible agony on the following day. By midnight the  pain I was enduring began to moderate, though my hand and arm were swollen to  double the proper size, and a splitting headache kept me awake till daylight.  The shock to the system affected me for quite a week afterward.</p>
<p>During many subsequent visits to the Marshall  Group our crews were always cautioned by the people of the various islands  about eating fish or shell-fish without submitting them to local examination.  In the Radack chain of this widely spread out archipelago we found that the  lagoons were comparatively free from poisonous fish, while the Ralick lagoons  were infested with them, quite 30 per cent, being highly dangerous at all times  of the year, and nearly 50 per cent at other seasons. Jaluit Lagoon was, and is  now, notorious for its poisonous fish. It is a curious fact that fish of a  species which you may eat with perfect safety, say, in the middle of the month,  will be pronounced by the expert natives to be dangerous a couple of weeks  later, and that in a &ldquo;school&rdquo; of pink rock bream numbering many hundreds some  may have their poison highly developed, others in but a minor degree, whilst  many may be absolutely free from the taint. In the year 1889 the crew of a  large German ship anchored in one of the Marshall Islands caught some very  large and handsome fish of the bream kind, and the resident natives pronounced  them &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Three or four days later some more were taken, and the cook did  not trouble to ask native opinion. The result was that eight or nine men were  taken seriously ill, and for some time the lives of several were despaired of.  Two of them had not recovered the use of their hands and feet at the end of ten  weeks, and their faces, especially the eyes and mouth, seemed to be  permanently, though slightly distorted. All the men agreed in one particular,  that at midday they suffered most&mdash;agonising cramps, accompanied by shooting  pains in the head and continuous vomiting to the point of exhaustion, these  symptoms being very pronounced during the first week or eight days after the  fish had been eaten.</p>
<p>That kind-hearted and unfortunate officer,  Commodore J. G. Goodenough, took an interest in the poisonous and stinging fish  of the Pacific Islands, and one day showed me, preserved in spirits of wine, a  specimen of the dreaded <i>no&rsquo;u</i> fish of the Hervey Group&mdash;one of the most  repulsive-looking creatures it is possible to imagine out of a child&rsquo;s fairy  book. The deadly poison which this fish ejects is contained in a series of sacs  at the base of the spines, and the commodore intended to submit it to an  analyist. By a strange coincidence this gallant seaman a few months afterwards  died from the effects of a poisoned arrow shot into his side by the natives of  Nukapu, one of the Santa Cruz group of islands.</p>
<p>This <i>no&rsquo;u</i> however, which is the <i>nofu</i> of the Samoans, and is widely known throughout Polynesia, and Melanesia under  different names, does not disguise its deadly character under a beautiful  exterior like the stinging fish of Micronesia, which I have described above.  The <i>nofu</i> which is also met with on the coasts of Australia, is a devil  undisguised, and belongs to the angler family. Like the octopus or the  death-adder (<i>Acanthopis antarctica</i>) of Australia, he can assimilate his  colour to his environment. His hideous wrinkled head, with his staring goggle  eyes, are often covered with fine wavy seaweed, which in full-grown specimens  sometimes extends right down the back to the tail. From the top of the upper  jaw, along the back and sides, are scores of needle-pointed spines, every one  of which is a machine for the ejection of the venom contained at the root. As  the creature lies hidden in a niche of coral awaiting its prey&mdash;it is a  voracious feeder&mdash;it cannot be distinguished except by the most careful  scrutiny; then you may see that under the softly waving and suspended piece of  seaweed (as you imagine it to be) there are fins and a tail. And, as the <i>nofu</i> has a huge mouth, which is carefully concealed by a fringe of apparently  harmless seaweed or other marine growth, he snaps up every unfortunate small  fish which comes near him. In the Pacific Islands the <i>nofu</i> (<i>i.e.</i>,  &ldquo;the waiting one &ldquo;) is generally a dark brown, inclining to black, with  splashes or blotches of orange, or marbled red and grey. In Australian waters&mdash;I  have caught them in the Parramatta river, Port Jackson&mdash;they are invariably  either a dark brown or a horrid, dulled yellow.</p>
<p>Despite its poison-injecting apparatus this  fish is eaten by the natives of the Society, Hervey, and Paumotu groups of  islands, in the South Pacific, where its flesh is considered a delicacy. It is  prepared for cookery by being skinned, in which operation the venomous sacks  are removed. In 1882, when I was living on the island of Peru in the Gilbert  Group (the Francis Island of the Admiralty charts), a Chinese trader there  constantly caught them in the lagoon and ate them in preference to any other  fish. Here in Peru the <i>nofu</i> would bury itself in the soft sand and watch  for its prey, and could always be taken with a hook. And yet in Eastern  Polynesia and in the Equatorial Islands of the Pacific many deaths have  occurred through the sting of this fish, children invariably succumbing to  tetanus within twenty-four hours of being stung.</p>
<p>A little more about poisonous fish, <i>i.e.</i>,  fish which at one time of the year are good and palatable food and at others  deadly. In the lagoon island of Nukufetau (the &ldquo;De Peyster Island&rdquo; of the  charts), where the writer lived for twelve months, the fish both within the  lagoon and outside the barrier reef became highly poisonous at certain times of  the year. Flying-fish (which were never caught inside the lagoon) would be safe  to eat if taken on the lee side of the island, dangerous, or at least doubtful,  if taken on the weather side; <i>manini</i>, a small striped fish much relished  by the natives, would be safe to eat if caught on the reef on the western side  of the island, slightly poisonous if taken four miles away on the inside shore  of the eastern islets encompassing the lagoon. Sharks captured outside the  reef, if eaten, would produce symptoms of poisoning&mdash;vomiting, excessive  purging, and tetanus in a modified form; if caught inside the reef and eaten no  ill effects would follow. Crayfish on one side of the lagoon were safe; three  miles away they were highly impregnated with this mysterious poison, the origin  of which has not yet been well defined by scientists.</p>
