  The House</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens! Isn&rsquo;t he going to  marry Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing like that. His fianc&eacute;e  is a youngster of the dolly-baby type. Queen Rose of the rosebud garland of  girls, and such-like. All pink and cream and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t arrive until tomorrow.  But I&rsquo;ve seen her photograph and miniature and oil painting and water color  sketch and crayon drawing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. But I thought  Sylvia was a foregone conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bleat that to anybody else.  Gosh, man, when have you seen old Guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for two or three years. I&rsquo;ve  been abroad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Well, that&rsquo;s the  situation. Little Pinky-Winky will have lots of ancestral acres to disport  herself on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, what a house! I didn&rsquo;t know  there was anything like it in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never been here before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; except for a few times in New  York, I haven&rsquo;t seen Guy since Commencement Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was ten years ago. Much  water has flowed down our throats since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob Arnold smiled reminiscently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot you were the wag of the  class, Trigg,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to have laughed earlier in the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Billy Trigg  sighed. &ldquo;And anyway, I feel more sentimental than humorous, today. Great stunt  of Mackenzie&rsquo;s, getting so many of the old class together. What do you call the  house? Gothic? You know about such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is it&rsquo;s in the Gothic  tradition. Marvelous idea, to build it on this hill. Lucky it happened to be  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, anything can happen on Long  Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it can on Manhattan, Rhode or  Great Britain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but Long Island, somehow,  connotes all sorts of happenings, jazz and crime, bootleggers and bathing  beauties&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut out the cheap cynical,  and let me gaze on this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob Arnold was all to the good in  his admiration of the building. Planned by a clever New England architect of  great originality and daring, it was an echo of old France and clung to the  purity and harmony of the medieval Gothic, before later centuries brought about  the more florid decoration.</p>
<p>The middle section of the enormous  pile was not unlike a church, with its great square tower and the long  structure behind it. From either side sprang massed buildings which it were  sacrilege to call wings, and which extended, with roofs of varying height for  many, many feet.</p>
<p>Yet it was plain, far from ornate  and the oriels and turrets were where they belonged, and never obtrusive or  uncalled for.</p>
<p>On an eminence, in the northern  part of Nassau County, it was the pride of the village of Penrose, which  nestled happily in the valley below.</p>
<p>This house Ralph Mackenzie had  ordained, not from any desire for display or in any spirit of vanity or  ostentation. He wanted it first, to gratify his love of beautiful architecture,  and second, to provide him with a hobby, and interest in life which, since the  death of his adored wife, had been sadly lacking.</p>
<p>So, some years since, the home had  been completed, and he lived there with his only child, Guy, who shared his  father&rsquo;s love of the worthwhile things of earth.</p>
<p>Together, they traveled the  foreign countries and selected the treasures that would suitably adorn and  enrich Warlock House.</p>
<p>Though Ralph Mackenzie&rsquo;s Scotch  ancestors were many generations behind him, yet in a few instances he clung to  his background and traditions.</p>
<p>Father and son were pals. Much  together, yet each had a free foot and they came and went as they chose.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie, at fifty-five,  was as keen on sport and exercise as Guy at twenty-eight.</p>
<p>No trace of the alleged Scottish  penuriousness remained in his system, and he gave his boy free rein and muckle  siller.</p>
<p>They were business men, in the  sense that they visited a Wall Street office, when occasion demanded, and thus  kept the pot boiling.</p>
<p>But one fly inhabited Mackenzie&rsquo;s  ointment.</p>
<p>He wanted Guy to marry, and  heretofore, the young man had met no girl who charmed him sufficiently.</p>
<p>It had been tacitly assumed that  he would marry Sylvia Field, the orphan daughter of a bosom friend of the late  Mrs. Mackenzie, who had been adopted into the household several years ago.</p>
<p>But though good friends, their  chumminess had not ripened into love, and the elder Mackenzie at last began to  think that it never would.</p>
<p>And then, one day, Guy brought the  joyful news to his father that he was engaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to the prettiest girl in the  world,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Not as a matter of opinion, but as a matter of fact. How do  I know? Because there couldn&rsquo;t be any one prettier! There just couldn&rsquo;t! It  would be a physical impossibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder Mackenzie smiled. This  was just the way he had felt about his girl, thirty years ago. And he knew Guy.  He knew that although his exuberance might lead him to exaggeration, yet any  girl his son selected would be a dear, sweet and true woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will Sylvia take it?&rdquo; he  said, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; Guy returned.  &ldquo;Sylvia and I have always been good pals, but we never thought of marriage.  Sylvia will just adore Fairy, same&rsquo;s I do. And you will, too, Dad. And how she  will love this dear old place. I can&rsquo;t wait to bring her here and show her to  you. Why, her face is like laughing sunshine, her hair is fairy gold, and her  eyes are like&mdash;like the blue chicory that blooms along the roadside in the fall.  And, Dad, she doesn&rsquo;t need all that paint stuff the girls daub on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven for that!&rdquo; said the  older man. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s her name&mdash;Fairy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I suppose she has another  name, but I&rsquo;ve never heard it. Now, don&rsquo;t ask anything more till you see her. I  want to get her down here as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the old time ancestry of  Ralph Mackenzie stirred within him, and he must have reverted to type or  something of that sort, for he insisted on a great celebration of the  announcement of his son&rsquo;s engagement.</p>
<p>Even Guy&rsquo;s eyes blinked as he was  informed of the fete his father planned.</p>
<p>If not in exact detail, yet in spirit  it gave the idea of banners, bugles and blazing bonfires. Of making the welkin  ring and the little hills rejoice on every side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pare it down a little, Dad,&rdquo; the  son said, finally. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a World&rsquo;s Fair or even a barbecue! But I&rsquo;ll  tell you what I would like. To have a big house party, say, over a week-end,  and ask all the old college chaps&mdash;oh, not our whole class, but all the members  of our Story-Book Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to make a goodly  company. I suppose most of them have wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. And we&rsquo;ll ask a  few others, and it&rsquo;ll be a jolly old reunion. Lots of the boys I haven&rsquo;t seen  since we graduated, ten years ago this very month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it a rousing party, son. You  can fill this house and the guest house, and use the gardener&rsquo;s cottage if you  like, or send your overflow to the Inn. We could put up some temporary  bungalows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the accommodations we have  will house all I want to invite. There were about twenty-five in the Club, but  of course they won&rsquo;t all come. And even with wives, we can put them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how the party came  about. And as the majority of those who were invited came, the rooms of Warlock  House were taxed to their utmost.</p>
<p>But dormitories were speedily  improvised, and the spacious guest house was made ready, and some few bachelor  chaps were sent over to the Inn to sleep.</p>
<p>But even so, there was crowding,  until Sylvia proposed that she and Miss Lovell, which was Fairy&rsquo;s other name,  should take up their quarters in the gardener&rsquo;s cottage, which was most  habitable, and the gardener and his wife could sleep in their attic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto,&rdquo; agreed Mackenzie, &ldquo;and  as there are three good bedrooms and they are all on the ground floor, I&rsquo;ll go  over there, too, to protect you girls from all harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; commented Guy, &ldquo;for that way,  I can have a lot of the chaps here in the house with me, and if we don&rsquo;t turn  in at curfew, we won&rsquo;t be keeping decent folks awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your carousing?&rdquo; Sylvia  said, in mock horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t give it such a  harsh name, but when a reunion sets in, fellows are pretty apt to turn backward  the time in its flight, and become college boys again, just for tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Uncle Ralph,&rdquo; Sylvia  said, &ldquo; &rsquo;twill be as well for the little girl and me to keep out of the way of  such goings on, and we&rsquo;ll be glad to have you under our roof. Though any  self-respecting burglar would hesitate before entering the place while the  party is on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Sylvia resented the impending  advent of another, where she had been tacitly the mistress of the house for so  long, she made no sign of such feeling.</p>
<p>Loving both of the men in whose  home she lived, she knew she had no real right to question or even comment on  anything they might do. Yet she greatly longed to know more about Guy&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>She had seen her photograph, a lovely  flower face, with a sweet, appealing expression. She had seen paintings of her,  with soft, seashell tints, that might or might not be the same in real life.</p>
<p>She had asked Guy many questions,  but his answers had been merely floods of enthusiastic laudation and almost  incoherent ravings about her beauty and charm. Surely Guy was hard hit, for  Sylvia couldn&rsquo;t believe there was a human being so transcendently lovely as he  made out.</p>
<p>Sylvia herself was a beautiful  girl. About twenty-four, she was beset by admirers, but flouted all of them,  saying to her intimates that none of them was just quite exactly right.</p>
<p>Of a different type from Fairy,  Sylvia&rsquo;s charm lay in her gentle dignity and quiet manner. Yet she was quickly  receptive and responsive to anyone who could rouse her interest.</p>
<p>Except for a vague uncertainty as  to what Fairy might turn out to be, Sylvia looked forward to the house party  with eager anticipation, for she loved people, and was glad at the thought of  seeing some of the men Guy had so often talked about.</p>
<p>And now, it was Friday afternoon  and the majority of the guests had arrived and were scattered all over the  great place.</p>
<p>Sylvia, nominally hostess,  dispensed tea on the terrace, while housekeepers and stewards conducted  newcomers to their rooms.</p>
<p>About a score of the members of  Guy&rsquo;s class were there, nearly half of them accompanied by their wives. Others  could not come until the next day, when the number would reach forty or more.</p>
<p>A merry crowd, but, naturally, the  talk ran to reminiscences and recollections of the old days at Alma Mater.</p>
<p>The Story-Book Club was lovingly  talked about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best Club I ever belonged to,&rdquo;  declared Egbert Reed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree, good Egg,&rdquo; said somebody  else, and they all laughed to hear again the old nickname.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me a namby-pamby  idea,&rdquo; said Dorothy Reed, wife of the good Egg, &ldquo;I mean for college boys. I  thought they ran to more exciting stunts than reading story books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were exciting story  books,&rdquo; explained Guy. &ldquo;And by the best writers. We did have all sorts of  societies and fraternities that carried out the hackneyed plans of  undergraduates since college life began. But they were merely amusement. Our  Club was the real thing. It was a literary society in the best sense of the  term, and we had the best fellows of the class in it. Look at &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he waved an  inclusive arm at the scattered group. &ldquo;Can you beat the lot for successful  achievement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Guy sounds a little like a  Sunday-school superintendent,&rdquo; grunted Bob Arnold, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s right. We did have  foolish clubs, jazz and poker and mystic stuff. But the Story-Book Club was for  keeps. Remember the way the chaps who couldn&rsquo;t get into it ragged us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet I do!&rdquo; responded another.  &ldquo;They used to sing:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo; &lsquo;Nobody but a congenital dub<br>
Would ever belong to the Story-Book Club.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and:</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Few story books, but lots of good  grub<br>
Make up the fare of the Story-Book Club.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, those were the disgruntled  fellows who hadn&rsquo;t brains enough to pass the tests. Look what it did for us!  Stories of adventure made me an explorer, and whatever I may have accomplished,  I aimed high anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And brought down your quarry  every time!&rdquo; declared Guy, for he was talking to one of the most successful and  intrepid big game hunters of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did, Masterson,&rdquo;  corroborated Van Allen. &ldquo;And it was the Club that set my feet in the right  direction, when I essayed writing fiction. I should probably have been a  plumber otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It made me a story writer, too,&rdquo;  observed Jack Mullins. &ldquo;Only detective stories, to be sure, but that is clearly  my field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet it is,&rdquo; and Van Allen  nodded enthusiastically. &ldquo;And as for Bob Arnold, it made him a real, live  detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold laughed. &ldquo;Alive but not  very real,&rdquo; he conceded. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t won any spurs to speak of as yet, but I may  some day. Give me a chance, that&rsquo;s all I ask. I certainly did get interested in  the work because of our Club. Gosh, it doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that was ten years  ago! What have you done Guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Oh, well, you know why you&rsquo;re  here. You know why I see so many bright and happy faces gathered around  me&mdash;Arnold says I&rsquo;m a Sunday-school superintendent, so I must talk like one. But  as to the story books, I think I read mostly love stories&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo; &lsquo;His only books <br>
  Were women&rsquo;s  looks,<br>
And folly&rsquo;s all they taught him,&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>quoted somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong,&rdquo; Guy said, smiling. &ldquo;For  ten years I&rsquo;ve ducked the feminine element, except in stories. Dad despaired of  my ever settling down as a family man and all that. But all of a sudden, I was  bowled over, absolutely, completely and everlastingly, by a fairy who stole my  heart away, but whose magic wand transformed the whole world into a paradise of  joy and gladness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she? We want to see  her!&rdquo; cried several insistent voices, and Guy left the group to step inside the  house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she hidden in there?&rdquo; asked  one of the wives, a gay, pretty young woman named Helena Masterson. &ldquo;Is she  planning a dramatic presentation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Guy returned with an armful of  pictures. There were photographs, drawings and paintings in all mediums and of  all styles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; he said, proudly.  &ldquo;She is coming here tomorrow. I am not afraid to show you these portraits, for  the original is as much more beautiful as real life is ahead of art. Still, you  can get an idea of her type from these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I should say we could!&rdquo; and  they all fell upon the pictures.</p>
<p>For a time there were no remarks  save exclamations of surprise and admiration.</p>
<p>And small wonder, for the girl  portrayed was the most exquisite bit of humanity imaginable.</p>
<p>Photographs gave truthful  representations of line and expression, while colored paintings and tinted  sketches revealed the soft bloom of a wondrous complexion, gold curls of hair,  and eyes, whose pure deep blue was intensified by long lashes and perfectly  arched eyebrows.</p>
<p>Yet there was no touch of  artificiality, no trace of coquetry or guile.</p>
<p>It was a sweet, innocent face, a  face on which, looking once, one looked quick again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell,&rdquo; said Masterson, calmly,  &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t no such animile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though vulgar in itself, the  resonant earnestness of the man robbed the speech of all offense, and Guy only  laughed happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; he cried,  joyously, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s mine. Honest, I can&rsquo;t believe that anything so wonderful  could happen to me as to be engaged to that girl! But I am, and tomorrow you  shall all see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she? Where does she  live? What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo; and even more personal questions were flung at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name&rsquo;s Fairy Lovell, and she  lives in New York City, and she&rsquo;s twenty-two years old, and she&rsquo;s as sweet and  lovely of soul as she is beautiful of face. And you will all rave over her,  because&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I asked you here for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rave, if she&rsquo;s anything at  all like her pictures,&rdquo; Billy Trigg promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she any faults?&rdquo; asked Van  Allen, pleadingly. &ldquo;Do tell us some trifling flaw, so we can believe in her at  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one I can think of,&rdquo; Guy  said, &ldquo;is her inordinate love of candy. She eats too many sweets. I tell her it  will make her fat, but she only laughs and says she isn&rsquo;t fat yet. And she  isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the last so seriously,  with an apprehensive glance at the full length pictures, that they all roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telegraph for a ton,&rdquo;  declared Mullins. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her favorite kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marshmallows,&rdquo; said Guy, still  serious. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t order any. I&rsquo;ve laid in a stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, tea over, they separated  into small groups and drifted apart to stroll about the grounds or try a tennis  game.</p>
<p>Sylvia was in demand everywhere.  With her tall, straight figure and sensitive, mobile face, she was a fine type  of out-doorsy girl, and she entered into the spirit of the party with zest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen Guy&rsquo;s paragon?&rdquo;  asked Van Allen, as he led her toward the gardens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed. Why, Uncle Ralph,  even, hasn&rsquo;t seen her. But you see, the engagement is only a week old, and Guy  wants to spring her on us all at once. I&rsquo;m sure we shall all love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia&rsquo;s voice was steady and her  tone sincere, but Van Allen, who was a novelist, and a student of human nature,  felt rather than heard or saw a slight melancholy in her speech, and was sure  she had schooled herself to the situation and was determined to make the best  of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, you&rsquo;re bound to  love the girl Guy chooses,&rdquo; he said, lightly, feeling sure this was the best  course to take.</p>
<p>But the wistful smile that Sylvia  conjured up, made him more than ever certain that she cared deeply and that she  had to struggle to preserve her firm hold on her emotions.</p>
<p>Guy had remained on the terrace to  gather up the pictures of his sweetheart.</p>
<p>Lovingly he gazed at each as he  put them back into their envelopes or cases, and with a deep sigh of content,  he said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a marvel! a wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sure is, old top!&rdquo; agreed  Billy Trigg, heartily.</p>
<p>Trigg and Arnold and the two Reeds  had tarried with Guy, as the others dispersed.</p>
<p>Guy took the pictures inside, and  when he returned his father was with him.</p>
<p>Introductions were made, and the  groups stood on the broad terrace, overlooking the slope,&mdash; part lawns and part  rocks,&mdash;down to the valley.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie, though a keen  business man, had a charming little air of his own. It was so simple as to be  almost child-like, yet no one ever underrated his mentality or his wise  judgment.</p>
<p>But his courtesy and innate  politeness were so marked as to give him an effect of self-effacement, and many  who knew him only in his home, would have been astounded to see him when  involved in big business, or when obliged to maintain his rights.</p>
<p>He greeted Dorothy Reed like a  gentleman of the old school, but immediately proved his up-to-dateness by the  way he discussed politics with her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;re to have a  daughter,&rdquo; Dorothy said gayly, taking an immediate liking to Guy&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I approve of her,&rdquo; and the  smile he threw to Guy proved he was chaffing. &ldquo;I am hard to please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be, indeed, to find a  flaw in that bit of perfection whose portraits we have seen,&rdquo; Reed said. &ldquo;I can  scarce wait for tomorrow, myself can you, Bob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; Arnold returned, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t  be here to see the fairy. I&rsquo;m in this party but not of it. Which means, that I  could only accept the invitation for this one night. I have to be in New York  tomorrow, and rather early at that. I told Guy this, and, though expressing  decent regret, he understands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m darned sorry,&rdquo; Guy said,  earnestly. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re a terribly busy chap, Bob, but I do want you to see  her. Well, we&rsquo;re glad to have you for overnight, and I shall hope to get you  out here again, as soon as may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you postpone your getaway  till afternoon, anyhow ?&rdquo; Dorothy begged him, but Bob said it was impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat the Story-Book Club,&rdquo; Billy  Trigg exclaimed. &ldquo;It was that that made Bob a detective. If he hadn&rsquo;t belonged,  and got all het up with sleuth stories, he&rsquo;d been probably a captain of  industry, and have all the time there is at his disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have enough of the old  guard,&rdquo; laughed Arnold, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ll ask me, Guy, I&rsquo;ll come and visit you  when I get a vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask you now,&rdquo; declared Guy.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re invited for any time, before or after the wedding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Dorothy, with a  woman&rsquo;s interest in the event, &ldquo;when will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can persuade the  Fairy to set the date,&rdquo; said Guy. &ldquo;Dad has long wanted me to settle down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I approve of the lady,&rdquo; warned  his father, who loved to harp on a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she deaf or dumb?&rdquo; asked Trigg.  &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be blind with those eyes, and the pictures speak for themselves as  to her disposition and intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not the man to marry a  dumb wife, in any sense of the word,&rdquo; Guy laughed, and then they dispersed to  dress for dinner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  The Crowd</b></h2>
<p>If the exterior of Warlock House  was beautiful, the interior was even more so. For, having been planned with  perfect proportions and harmony, it was furnished with the most rare and choice  pieces obtainable.</p>
<p>Yet it did not look like a museum,  nor like a high class auction gallery, as is only too often the case.</p>
<p>Everything contributed to comfort  and livableness, as well as to beauty and interest.</p>
<p>The great hall, which comprised  the two lower stories of the square tower, was the general congregating room,  and from it opened bewildering vistas of smaller reception rooms,  drawing-rooms, lounges, smoking rooms, billiard room, large and small library  and dining rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never get beyond this  room,&rdquo; Dorothy Reed exclaimed, as, the first one down for dinner, she danced up  to Ralph Mackenzie, who smiled at her in frank admiration.</p>
<p>Dorothy was a little brunette,  full of verve and charm. She wore scarlet velvet, with gold fringe, and her  sleek little bobbed head turned alertly about, like a bird&rsquo;s, as she noted one  treasure after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you invite me to stay a  month, I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t get through the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mackenzie had already turned  to greet other guests and the party rapidly assembled.</p>
<p>Sylvia appeared, lovely in black  and silver, her great gray eyes flashing a welcome to all, for several guests  had arrived since tea time.</p>
<p>The enormous fireplace of carved  stone took up most of one side of the room while opposite it, on a balcony with  a vaulted roof, was a magnificent organ.</p>
<p>Tapestries covered the walls,  pictures appeared in appropriate places, and on the tables the rare art  treasures were flanked by the homelier comforts of life, such as smoking  things, light reading, personal photographs and writing materials.</p>
<p>As might have been expected, many  of the photographs were of the eagerly looked-for Fairy, and, taken in every  mood of joyousness and gayety, these proved an absorbing study even to those  who had already seen most of them.</p>
<p>A superb corona hung from the  ceiling and aided by many lamps and sconces gave the hall a soft illumination  that was exactly right.</p>
<p>The cocktails appeared, and soon  the merry party were ushered to the dining room.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie sat at the head of  one long table and his son at another.</p>
<p>Guy looked beamingly happy. He was  a good-looking chap, tall and square shouldered, with brown hair that  obstinately curled, in spite of his lifetime of vigorous brushing.</p>
<p>And the curling hair was not the  only obstinate thing about Guy. His temperament was stubborn, and though he  would often surrender his views to those of another, it would be because of his  generosity and good nature, not because he was made to change his own opinion.</p>
<p>Sylvia sat at Guy&rsquo;s right hand,  and if she felt a tinge of sadness that the next day she must resign that place  to another, it would never be suspected from her looks or manner.</p>
<p>She was gay and merry, and though  she said little, that was easily explained by the fact that the reunited men  were so full of their own interests and reminiscences that for once the  feminine portion of the party had to take a back seat. Even the wives of the  married ones knew little and cared less about the doings of college days that  seemed so important to their husbands, and, though nobody was bored, the race  was to the swift and the battle to the strong on that occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired of all this long-ago talk?&rdquo;  said the elder Mackenzie to Dorothy Reed, who sat at his right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I love  it. And if it&rsquo;s about matters that I&rsquo;ve no interest in, there&rsquo;s the room to  look at, and the tables, and the people. Oh, Mr. Mackenzie, your new  daughter-in-law can surely say her lines have fallen in pleasant places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Tell me, Mrs. Reed,  what do you think of her pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s the most exquisite thing  I&rsquo;ve ever seen! She&rsquo;s truly a fairy, a bit of thistledown, a darling of the  gods. Fate&rsquo;s favorite, I should call her, with all that wonderful beauty of her  own, and your splendid Guy into the bargain. To say nothing of achieving a most  delightful father-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pretty Dorothy smiled up at him,  and Mackenzie bowed gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not about  the father-in-law,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I can fill that role, I&rsquo;m sure. But I wish I  might have seen her and talked with her before Guy took the irrevocable step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir, you don&rsquo;t think  you could have stopped Guy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then somebody spoke across them,  and the subject was changed and never resumed.</p>
<p>As there were so many more men  than women present, the group that left the table when dinner was over was but  a small one. They were conducted to a reception room, and as they went Dorothy  called back, gayly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too long over your port.  You know we shan&rsquo;t have a happy moment till you rejoin us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her words were forgotten, as  the men, getting together in little groups began afresh their never ending  &ldquo;Say, remember the time&mdash;&rdquo; or their repeated assertion that &ldquo;them was the days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All men of thirty or more, most of  them successful in their business or profession, the years fell away and they  were one and all back in their college dormitory, classroom or campus.</p>
<p>As Mackenzie, senior, waxed  restless, and hinted they should rejoin the ladies, not a few of the guests  wished they had left their wives at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, have a heart!&rdquo; irrepressible  Billy Trigg broke out. &ldquo;Tomorrow night the little girl will be here, and then  we can&rsquo;t keep old Guy out here unless we gag and bind him. Give us a gabfest  now, while we own him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they rattled on, until at last  Dorothy appeared in the doorway with an ultimatum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you boys come in here with  us,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll come back here to you! We refuse to be ignored for  any old college!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie rose with  alacrity, and the others perforce followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that we don&rsquo;t adore all  you witching belles,&rdquo; Trigg cajoled her, &ldquo;but we may never see Guy alone  again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we understand,&rdquo; Dorothy  assured him. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t for a moment doubt your adoration, but we want to  dance. So come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the men obeyed her behest,  though some, who didn&rsquo;t dance, edged off toward the lounge or smoking room.</p>
<p>And shocking to relate, others  followed, unable to withstand the lure.</p>
<p>Finally Dorothy surrendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Miss Field,&rdquo; she said to  Sylvia. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to bed and leave these brutes to babble their inanities about  their salad days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s making a virtue of  necessity,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Masterson, &ldquo;for they&rsquo;re deserting us one by one. I can  hear my husband starting on his story of the crocodile who scraped acquaintance  with him in Egypt, and that always takes an hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go and listen in,&rdquo;  suggested Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Dorothy Reed sighed,  &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t want us. Let&rsquo;s go to bed, or have kimono parties in our rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they gave the men mocking good  nights and went off to their bedrooms.</p>
<p>The married couples had been  quartered in the guest house, a roomy building that easily accommodated them.</p>
<p>And as Sylvia was to sleep in the  gardener&rsquo;s cottage, this left the main house at the disposal of the bachelor  guests or grass widowers and their host, Guy.</p>
<p>The Inn was not needed for entertainment  as yet, but might be when more people arrived the next day.</p>
<p>So, though many of the married men  reluctantly left earlier, the majority of the guests sat up and talked until  the dawn began to dim the lights inside.</p>
<p>Sylvia, leaving the big house, accompanied  by her maid, walked over to the gardener&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>This was a small but attractive  house, inhabited by a worthy couple named Gerson, the husband being chief  gardener of the estate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerson was a shrewd, capable  woman, and she welcomed Sylvia with volubility and a wealth of explanations and  directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, Miss Sylvie,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the place all spick and span for you. I&rsquo;ve given the best front room  to the lady of Mr. Guy&rsquo;s. And I&rsquo;ve put Mr. Mackenzie in the other front room.  He&rsquo;s in there now, asleep, I guess, but we can talk a bit, for he sleeps sound.  Now, you keep Jenny, your maid, just as long as you like, and I&rsquo;ll be watching  up to let her out and lock the door after her. Sorry not to keep her here, but  that&rsquo;s all the rooms there are. Me and Jim sleep upstairs, but there&rsquo;s only the  one room there. Now, you see, you have this back room, behind Mr. Guy&rsquo;s lady.  But it&rsquo;s a nice room and you&rsquo;re nearer the bathroom. There&rsquo;s only one bath, you  know, but you can manage, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mrs. Gerson,&rdquo; Sylvia  strove to cut off the flood of chatter, &ldquo;I can manage nicely. And Jenny need  stay but a short time. Thank you, and now you run along, for I&rsquo;m quite tired  out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cottage was built on simple  lines, indeed, it was practically a bungalow.</p>
<p>The bedroom end was foursquare,  and had a hall straight through the middle. On the left, as one entered, came  first the chamber allotted to Fairy Lovell. It was neat and pretty, done up in  gray paint and pleasant chintzes. Back of it was Sylvia&rsquo;s room, also  attractive.</p>
<p>Across the hall, the front room  was Ralph Mackenzie&rsquo;s, and back of that was the bathroom.</p>
<p>Accustomed to her own luxurious  suite, Sylvia shrugged her shoulders a little, then said to her maid:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, Jenny, it doesn&rsquo;t  matter for a few nights. But I don&rsquo;t understand giving Miss Lovell such a plain  room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else could they do, Miss  Sylvia?&rdquo; said the sagacious Jenny. &ldquo;It is nicer for her to be here with you and  Mr. Mackenzie than with the strangers in the guest house. And she couldn&rsquo;t put  up with those rackety chaps and Mr. Guy in the big house. It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Jenny&rsquo;s favorite phrase,  and said with an air of finality, generally settled a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, Jenny. Now get me  to bed quickly, not to keep good Mrs. Gerson up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And soon Sylvia was left alone in  the cottage room, and, unable to sleep, lay musing and wondering as to what the  morrow would bring.</p>
<p>For Sylvia adored Guy.</p>
<p>Not with any dumb, dog-like  devotion, she was not that sort, but with a healthy, deep-souled love that had  singled him out from all the men she knew as the finest and best.</p>
<p>And she felt, whether rightly or  wrongly, that if he had never met this flibbertigibbet&mdash;yes, she dubbed her  that&mdash;his heart must sooner or later respond to her carefully hidden but  sometimes overpowering love.</p>
<p>As it was the last night before  Fairy&rsquo;s arrival, and as there was no possible danger of interruption, she  allowed herself the luxury of a good cry, and though it eased her a little  physically, her heart grew ever sorer at the thought of the arriving guest.</p>
<p>But she had made up her mind to be  just the kindest and sweetest hostess to Guy&rsquo;s girl, and to leave no stone  unturned to make her visit happy and joyous.</p>
<p>Too, Sylvia was proud, and she  determined no prying eyes or ears, not even intuitive Dorothy Reed should  discover or even suspect her secret.</p>
<p>Her heart should not be worn on  her sleeve, but in her breast, where it belonged, and where it could in no way  show that it was broken in twain.</p>
<p>And so at last Sylvia slept, and  did not waken until Jenny, admitted by Mrs. Gerson, came to dress her.</p>
<p>Jenny brought her morning tea, and  soon after, a very spick and span Sylvia in a smart sports suit, left the  cottage to go over to the big house for breakfast.</p>
<p>This meal was a long drawn-out  one, for the guests drifted in as they chose, and once there, they stayed.</p>
<p>Bob Arnold, desiring to sit by  Sylvia, calmly boosted Billy Trigg out of his chair and appropriated it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a cut in dance,&rdquo; Trigg  complained, but Arnold said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re staying on, old chap, but  I have to go back to New York right after breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t be here to meet  Miss Lovell,&rdquo; Sylvia regretted. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Bob, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m  sorry. But I&rsquo;m one of the few of our crowd who must needs recognize the call of  duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come again soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Guy asked me to. And you&rsquo;ve  never seen the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sylvia said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve  spoken with her over the telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she impress you? One can  tell so much by a voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her voice was charming. But she  had a little mannerism, that is all right, of course, but which always  irritates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what in the world could that  be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is one of those who won&rsquo;t say  &lsquo;Hello,&rsquo; but says &lsquo;Ye-es?&rsquo; with a rising inflection. I don&rsquo;t say Hello, myself  in conversation, but I think it is a sort of idiom on the telephone and to  object to it, savors of pedantry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only that, but it tacitly  reproves the speaker who does use it. I quite share your distaste for that sort  of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m telling you  this,&rdquo; Sylvia smiled at him. &ldquo;Truly, I don&rsquo;t mean to be catty about the girl  Guy has chosen. I am prepared to welcome her with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are, and you will do  so. After all, that&rsquo;s a very small fault, and it is the only one I&rsquo;ve heard  attributed to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or I. I know she is a perfect  darling, or Guy wouldn&rsquo;t adore her as he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. He&rsquo;s never been a  Great Lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never before. But he is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia looked a little wistful,  for Arnold was the sort one involuntarily confides in.</p>
<p>Though really a private detective,  he was by no means a famous one. He had gone about the business quietly, with  no flourish of trumpets, and the cases in which he had achieved his most marked  success had not been cases that were played up in the newspapers.</p>
<p>At college, they had called him  Wiz Arnold, because he had amused himself and the others by making Sherlockian  deductions from what seemed to be casual observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the man they call Wizard,  aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and Sylvia&rsquo;s gray eyes challenged him. &ldquo;Tell me, what do you think  of Miss Lovell from her pictures? And after I know her, I&rsquo;ll tell you how  nearly you hit it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your task is too difficult. How  can one judge character or even temperament by a photograph? Still less by a  drawing or painting. The first method exaggerates all the worst points, while a  sketch emphasizes all the best ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, they do just that,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, thoughtfully. &ldquo;But for that very reason, you ought to be able to  balance the two and get the true girl as a result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I might, with more time  to examine and check up on the portraits. But it would be a hopeless task, I  fear. The portraits endow her with an elusive charm that is hard to classify.  But you&rsquo;ll soon know for yourself. She comes this morning, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In time for luncheon, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I must go now. I have to be  in New York by noon at latest, and it&rsquo;s a run of an hour and a half, to say the  least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a good car, if you can do  it in that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a good car. Small,  swift and sure. Forgive me for running away, and believe I&rsquo;m sorry. Good-by,  Miss Field, and do invite me soon again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold rose, made his brief  farewells to Mackenzie and the crowd in general and then, accompanied by Guy,  went out to his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoils the whole day for me,&rdquo; Guy  said, trying to look utterly despondent and not succeeding very well, because  of his bounding pulses and happy heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, dearie, I know,&rdquo; said  Bob, winking at him. &ldquo;But try to bear up, and perhaps some diversion will occur  to take your mind off our sad parting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it all, Bob, can&rsquo;t you stay?  Or come back? I do want you to see her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-o-me day&mdash;so-o-me day&mdash;&rdquo; trilled  Arnold, and easing himself in behind his wheel, he shot off down the road to  the gates.</p>
<p>And with him went Guy&rsquo;s sincere but  temporary regret, and for the fiftieth time that morning he looked at his watch  to see if it was time to go to meet her.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t be for  two hours or so, and the time must be killed somehow.</p>
<p>So Guy went back to seek his house  party, now scattered about the verandahs or the gardens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golf?&rdquo; he proposed. &ldquo;Tennis? a  motor drive? a swim? The water&rsquo;s not too far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were people enough to insure  the acceptance of each of his propositions and still leave a group or two to  sit on the balcony railings or the stone steps of the front portal and smoke  loquaciously.</p>
<p>A few beside Bob Arnold had to go  to the city, but most of them would return in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Hal Masterson had begun one of his  exciting yarns about a wild animal hunt and Sylvia was among the interested  listeners, when Guy came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute or two, Sylvia,&rdquo; he  beckoned to her, and she slipped away and walked off with him.</p>
<p>And glad enough she was for even a  short talk with the one who so soon would be swept away from her forever.</p>
<p>Her fancy may have exaggerated the  finality of the occasion, but she would have merely argued that until Fairy&rsquo;s  arrival, things were as they always had been. After that event everything would  be changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylly,&rdquo; Guy said, after they were  out of hearing of the others, &ldquo;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her heart gave a bound at the dear  old pet name he had used when they were children, but not often of late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Guy; what about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Fairy. You see,&mdash;&rdquo; he looked  into her eyes with a troubled expression in his own, &ldquo;Oh, damn it all, I can&rsquo;t  say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say anything to me, Guy,&rdquo;  and her clear eyes looked back at him with a wordless assurance of faith and  trust and helpfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I can!&rdquo; and his  brow cleared.</p>
<p>Guy had wonderful charm. As a baby  he had been willful and often disobedient but he met reproof with such  appealing penitence and such a cherubic smile of joy that the incident was  closed, that he utterly disarmed all intention of punishment.</p>
<p>And now, he smiled at Sylvia with  the confidence born of her never failing loyalty and assistance. She never had  failed him, he knew she never would. Her lovableness had never occurred to him.  He had been too accustomed to see her around to get a proper perspective of her  grace and beauty.</p>
<p>And, too, until he found Fairy  Lovell, he had given few thoughts to girls. They were all right to dance with  or to even flirt with, but as for a serious interest he kept putting it off  until a more convenient season.</p>
<p>Then Fairy had fallen, like a star  from heaven, right in his path, and he had scarcely dared to hope that he might  win her for his own.</p>
<p>And here he was, engaged to her,  about to announce it publicly&mdash;oh, it was too good to be true! Too much to  believe!</p>
<p>Sylvia, watching, saw the tender  smile around his mouth, the lovelight in his eyes, and understood.</p>
<p>Then she saw a troubled frown  drawn on the face she knew so well, and she said, quietly, &ldquo;Go on, dear. Tell  me,&mdash;get it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s Dad. I&rsquo;m afraid he  won&rsquo;t like Fairy.&rdquo; He blurted it out, with a glance at her so beseeching that  it took away all hint of pathos from his speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Sylvia very  seriously, for she was really alarmed. All along she had wondered if there were  not some as yet unhinted flaw in the paragon, but had put away the thought as  unworthy of herself or of Guy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;you see&mdash;&rdquo; clearly an  explanation was difficult, &ldquo;you know she isn&rsquo;t just exactly the sort to which  Dad has been accustomed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. But to what sort  has he been accustomed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that, of course. And Fairy  isn&rsquo;t like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he gave her an answering  smile, but he shook his head. &ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t imagine two more totally  different types.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, Uncle Ralph surely  knows there are several varieties of girls in the world. I wouldn&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean&mdash;well, what I mean is  this. I want you to stand up for&mdash;to back up Fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I shall! How could  I do anything else? She&rsquo;s your choice and that&rsquo;s all I need know about her to  make me her champion for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sylly, what a brick you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. But that won&rsquo;t  get us anywhere with Uncle Ralph. You&rsquo;d better tell me a few of the salient  features that you think may queer her with Uncle. Does she dance on the table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her a quick look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not literally.  But, in a way, that rather expresses what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; And for a moment the  understanding Sylvia was a little flattened out.</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;mentally, morally or  physically?&rdquo; she asked soberly.</p>
<p>Guy waxed a little pettish. &ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t take it like that!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anything definite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do mean something definite,&rdquo;  she returned, &ldquo;and unless you tell me I don&rsquo;t see how I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall. Trust me, dear. I&rsquo;m  Sylvia, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she had the satisfaction of  seeing his eyes light up and his face brighten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The Fairy</b></h2>
<p>Fairy had arrived.</p>
<p>For reasons best known to her  dictatorial self, she had chosen to come down from the city by train and be met  by Guy at the station.</p>
<p>Whither he went alone in a small  car, so that they might be by themselves for a few moments at least.</p>
<p>The sight of her put to flight all  his doubts and fears, all thoughts of his father and Sylvia and anybody else  but just the one marvelous creature who sat by his side, and who he could  hardly persuade himself was a human being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy!&rdquo; he said, like one in a  trance; &ldquo;Fairy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before his brain was  sufficiently coordinated for further talk, they had reached the house, and a  hail of welcome was greeting them.</p>
<p>Before Guy could get out of the  car, a dozen strong-armed huskies had lifted the slight form down and had  carried her bodily up on the terrace and deposited her with utmost care on a  throne, which they had improvised in Guy&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>A tall-backed chair, draped with  fur rugs and tapestries, looted from the hall. A crown fashioned, not  uncleverly, of pasteboard, covered with a gorgeous collection of rhinestone  slipper buckles, torn from the shoes of the women, who hoped against hope, that  they might some time be retrieved.</p>
<p>A great scepter of lilies and  larkspur, a gold foot-cushion, and the newcomer looked a veritable Queen of the  Fairies.</p>
<p>A sigh of content rose from many  hearts as appraising glances caused nods of satisfaction and murmurs of  approval.</p>
<p>For Fairy lived right up to her  portraits. The photographers had caught her marvelous perfection of line and  curve, and the artists had limned the coloring with utter truth.</p>
<p>There was no doubt about it, Fairy  Lovell was the most beautiful girl they had ever seen.</p>
<p>Even the husbands admitted it to  themselves. Even the wives admitted it to one another.</p>
<p>Even Sylvia acknowledged Fairy  perfect. Even Guy&rsquo;s father stared and stared as if he couldn&rsquo;t get enough of  that rare young beauty.</p>
<p>And then Fairy smiled. At first  she had sat demurely, soberly, taking in the homage offered, and then, as if  suddenly appreciating the humor of the situation, she smiled, and then the  crowd went mad.</p>
<p>They cheered and sang and gave  college yells, until it seemed like a football celebration.</p>
<p>They pulled out another great  chair and made a throne for Guy, pushed him into it, and commanded the  announcement now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said Ralph Mackenzie,  rising, and somehow managing to look as determined as his Scotch ancestors. &ldquo;We  Mackenzies like all such things done with proper decorum, and not in a racketty  way. Miss Lovell, I salute you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an old time, courtly grace,  he stepped up to her and kissed her hand, then he turned and went into the  house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s have some more fun!&rdquo;  cried Fairy, gleefully. &ldquo;Give me a cig, somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half a dozen full cases were  proffered her, and she took one, tapped it on her wrist, lighted it, and leaned  back indolently, her legs crossed and her wonderful flower face smiling happily  as she relaxed more and more in her luxurious throne chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a corking place,&rdquo; she said,  as she turned her glances to the view spread out before her. &ldquo;Is there a  dancing pavilion, Guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but there are several  buildings that could be rebuilt, or we&rsquo;ll have an entirely new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that would be best. Now,  tell me who these chaps are. Specially that one with the black mane? And the  blond baby? And the caveman, with the green shirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the green shirted one she  nodded at was Everard J. Granniss, and as he was a slender, undersized pale  young man, her caveman epithet brought a shout of applause.</p>
<p>It was the psychological moment  for Fairy. The men were all back ten years in their minds, they were all  college boys again, and this saucy, breezy young thing intrigued them with her  gay vivacity as well as with her beauty.</p>
<p>Guy sat and gazed at her as if he  wanted to eat her up.</p>
<p>Sylvia gave her covert looks when  she thought herself unobserved.</p>
<p>The men stared openly, the women,  for the most part, looked at her and then at one another.</p>
<p>But Fairy flouted them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; she said, rising,  stretching her arms above her head and yawning frankly. &ldquo;Will somebody please  show me to my room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and Sylvia got up  quickly.</p>
<p>Fairy threw down the scepter of  flowers, kicked away the foot-cushion, and, pulling off the sparkling diadem,  flung it on a chair, from which it rolled to the floor.</p>
<p>She paid no attention to these  things, and looking prettier than ever, with her hair tossed about, she linked  her arm into Sylvia&rsquo;s and said, chummily, &ldquo;Come along, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched her in silence as she  walked away. Her hair was the purest gold that hair could possibly be. It was  short, and clustered in ringlets,&mdash; not frizzy fuzz, but soft baby curls,&mdash;all  over her well-shaped little head.</p>
<p>Too, it was quite evidently  naturally curly and of its own natural color. Art could not achieve such hair  as that. All in all, Fairy was a perfect specimen of the purest and best type  of blonde that could be imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; she asked,  as Sylvia led her across the lawns to the gardener&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To an humble abode,&rdquo; laughed  Sylvia, &ldquo;but temporary. You see, the big house is full of Guy&rsquo;s bachelor  friends, or married ones who left their wives at home, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be  proper for you to be quartered there. So, you&rsquo;re over here with Uncle Ralph and  me to look after you, but you can spend all your waking hours with the crowd.  Did you bring a maid? I didn&rsquo;t see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Fairy answered.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just dismissed one, and hadn&rsquo;t time to get another. But I can do for  myself, or&mdash;&rdquo; she looked up rougishly, &ldquo;share yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, you shall have half  of Jenny; she&rsquo;s a real treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny appeared just then, and like  everybody else fell a victim to Fairy&rsquo;s compelling beauty.</p>
<p>As the maid unpacked Fairy&rsquo;s boxes  and bags, she realized that she would have her hands full keeping this wardrobe  in order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things were just tumbled in,  anyway,&rdquo; Fairy explained, smilingly, &ldquo;for my maid left me, and I had to do it  myself. But you&rsquo;ll straighten them all out, won&rsquo;t you, Jenny? Have the rumpled  things pressed off and bend the hats back into shape and whack the laundry off  to be done up. I say, Sylvia, what time is lunch? I think I&rsquo;ll take a scrap of  a nap. I&rsquo;m a wreck after my journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fairy threw her arms around  Sylvia&rsquo;s neck and gave her an affectionate kiss, and though a bit bewildered,  Sylvia returned the caress as she would have done to a willful child.</p>
<p>And in another moment, Fairy had  flung off her frock, wrapped herself in a feather-fringed kimono, and throwing  herself on the bed, closed her eyes like a tired baby.</p>
<p>Sylvia and Jenny gazed at her, and  then an eloquent glance passed between them, which, being interpreted, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never was there a more beautiful  picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Fairy, cuddled in a heap, her  hand beneath her roseleaf cheek, her golden curls tumbled, her red lips parted  a trifle, disclosing the perfect, pearly teeth, was an exquisite sight.</p>
<p>Jenny, noiselessly putting things  away, whispered an exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Sylvia, there&rsquo;s no make-up  box! Is she all real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be,&rdquo; and Sylvia, too,  scanned again the complexion and coloring of her guest.</p>
<p>Then she gave a sigh, that was  almost envy of this sprite of good fortune with her incredible dower of  nature&rsquo;s gifts,&mdash;and Guy into the bargain!</p>
<p>She went to her own room, next to  Fairy&rsquo;s, and dressed for luncheon. She didn&rsquo;t know quite what to do, for Fairy  was sleeping soundly, and it seemed a pity to waken her.</p>
<p>Yet it must be done. Household  routine was an inexorable law with them.</p>
<p>So Jenny wakened the sleeper, and  though Fairy scowled and growled out, &ldquo;Go away! I don&rsquo;t want to be bothered!&rdquo; she  quickly realized where she was, and sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Scuse me, Jenny,&rdquo; she said,  looking penitent. &ldquo;I forgot where I was,&rdquo; and so dear and sweet was her  expression that Jenny beamed on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale blue chiffon, please,  with pink roses,&rdquo; Fairy ordained, &ldquo;and the blue suede shoes,&mdash;and, oh, please  part my hair for me, Jenny, I always get it crooked&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s right. Thank  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold curls seemed to fall into  place of themselves, and Fairy danced out into the hall, and in at Sylvia&rsquo;s  open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Fraid I gobbled up Jenny,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll be more considerate next time. Oughta brought a maid person of  my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Sylvia  heartily, and then stopped to stare at the lovely vision whose frock, a mere  wisp of flowered chiffon, was just the right coloring and style to suit its  wearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fairy,&rdquo; said Sylvia,  involuntarily, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t it hurt to be so lovely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Fairy returned, with a  little peal of laughter. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m only pretty, Sylvia. You are beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Come along, now. Uncle  Ralph is annoyed if we&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he an ogre?&rdquo; Fairy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite. But he has Scotch  blood, you know, and it makes him a little bit domineering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sure I shall like  Daddy-in-law,&rdquo; observed Guy&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e under her breath, for they were nearing  the house.</p>
<p>But she was all smiles when she  greeted Ralph Mackenzie, and his stern eyes softened as he looked at her.</p>
<p>Then Guy claimed her, and luncheon  was served.</p>
<p>Fairy held the party spellbound.  Not that she said anything especially wise or even interesting, but she  listened respectfully and appreciatively, and when she did speak it was to the  point, and often unexpectedly apt.</p>
<p>And to look at her was enough.</p>
<p>Quiet-mannered, smiling-faced,  well-behaved in every way, she was such a picture of joyous youth, that many a  plate was removed untouched, because unnoticed.</p>
<p>After dessert there were bonbons,  and Fairy looked at them with interest. But the red lips pouted a little as she  failed to find the sort she wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it dear?&rdquo; asked Guy,  solicitously. &quot;There are marshmallows. I ordered them myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but they&rsquo;re the chocolate  covered kind. They won&rsquo;t do at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fairy clasped her hands  tragically, as at a national calamity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you want the dusty ones?  The ones that get sugar all over you and have to have a whisk broom served with  them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s the kind. Can&rsquo;t  we go to the village and get some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for them. They&rsquo;ll be  here in a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want &rsquo;em now,&rdquo; and the pout grew  more pronounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, then, I&rsquo;ll rush you  down to the village candy shop in three minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Billy Trigg who spoke, and  Fairy jumped from her seat and ran to him, laughing and saying, &ldquo;Goody! goody!  come along, Billy boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grasped his coat sleeve, and  he rose and let her drag him from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Masterson, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a  law unto herself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And always shall be!&rdquo; declared  Guy, who, though intensely annoyed at Fairy&rsquo;s actions, had no intention of  letting her be criticized by anybody else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch it for this!&rdquo; Billy  Trigg said, as, in his little two-seater they flew along toward the country  stores at Penrose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch it?&rdquo; and the cornflower  eyes looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Do you s&rsquo;pose old Guy  wanted you to hook it with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose I care what Guy  wanted, if I want something else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s the sort you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy was of a daring nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Fairy said, suddenly.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the sort I am. At least, that is my wicked temper that flares up  once in a while. But I&rsquo;m trying to control it. Honest, I am. Please take me  back&mdash;quickly! At once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stamped her little foot, in  its blue suede shoe, and Billy, who lived but to please people, turned around  immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a spitfire?&rdquo; he asked,  casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with people I like,&rdquo; she  returned, saucily, and then they smiled at each other and peace was restored.</p>
<p>They were back before the others  had left the table, and Fairy slipped into her place, next Guy, with a tender,  whimsical smile at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to go, really,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;I just pretended I was going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trigg heard this and, like the  lady mentioned in Holy Writ, pondered it in his heart.</p>
<p>As they all left the dining room,  Ralph Mackenzie laid a detaining hand on Sylvia&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, dear,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;to see about some plans for tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia went with him to his own  little library, and he closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he said, briefly,  and giving her a chair, he sat opposite to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What won&rsquo;t do, Uncle?&rdquo; she said,  brightly, merely to gain time. She knew full well what he meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy must not marry that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can be done?&rdquo; Sylvia  fenced no longer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all arranged. It will be announced at the fete this  afternoon. You can&rsquo;t stop it, Uncle. It&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t too late. It shan&rsquo;t  be too late! I will not have my son throw himself away on that worthless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop. Uncle, dear. Let&rsquo;s look at  it straight. She is very very lovely, you must admit that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit her beauty, yes. But a  Mackenzie must have more than beauty in a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traits such as you have, Sylvia.  You are the one for Guy. You should be mistress of Warlock House. You have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Uncle. You are prejudiced  in my favor, because you have known me so long. You are accustomed to me, and  so you think I am worthy. But, dear, you must remember that you are  inexperienced in the matter of girls. As you know Guy has not been much  inclined to society, has never been in love, &mdash;until now,&mdash;and the girl he has  chosen is the type of the present-day favorite. She is the modern girl in every  sense of the term, and, to me, she seems a sweet, pure, innocent and lovely  young thing. Her beauty and charm are marvelous, her intellect is above the  average, she is desperately in love with Guy and she will make him happy,&mdash;which  is the one desire of your heart and mine. Oh, Uncle Ralph, do not do or say a  thing that will mar this occasion. You can&rsquo;t stop the betrothal&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t,  if you could! Now, don&rsquo;t break Guy&rsquo;s heart and spoil everybody&rsquo;s pleasure by  any ill-advised interference, which can&rsquo;t do any good and must do incalculable  harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia had never spoken like this  to Mackenzie before, and it had great weight. For years he had deferred to her  taste and judgment in minor or household matters, but had never before had  occasion to discuss a real problem with her.</p>
<p>Although they were in no way  related, and her calling him uncle was only a matter of convenience, they were  sympathetic in most of their opinions and rather alike in character.</p>
<p>Her positive words calmed his  turbulent spirit, and after some further talk he agreed to wait until he knew  Fairy better before expressing his opinions to anyone else.</p>
<p>With his old-school courtesy, he  opened the door for Sylvia&rsquo;s exit, then closed it, and she heard the key turn  in the lock.</p>
<p>Heavy at heart, the girl wondered  if he would refuse to attend the fete in the afternoon, where the formal  announcement of the engagement was to take place.</p>
<p>Also, she wondered if she ought to  give Guy even a hint of warning as to his father&rsquo;s state of mind.</p>
<p>As she crossed the great hall and  came out upon the terrace, she saw Guy and Fairy there, alone.</p>
<p>Considerately she turned aside,  but Fairy called her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia, dear, come over here with  us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went toward them, and Guy rose  to move a chair for her, and then returned to his place by Fairy&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Guy&rsquo;s been a scoldin&rsquo; of me,&rdquo;  Fairy said, plaintively.</p>
<p>Yet it was not the whimpering note  of a spoiled child, but rather the hurt wail of a loyal little heart, unjustly  blamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; Sylvia asked,  unconsciously ranging herself on Fairy&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; said Guy,  petting Fairy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just my infernal jealousy, Sylvia. I can&rsquo;t stand it to see  Fairy even smile at anybody else&mdash;am I a fool?&rdquo; He looked at Sylvia with a  glance half beseeching, half belligerent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she returned, smiling  back at him, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve always been that. Doesn&rsquo;t Fairy know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia was determined to treat it  lightly, and Fairy met her half way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  marrying him to reform him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this all arose from the  marshmallow episode,&rdquo; Sylvia went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the village myself before  the fete, I&rsquo;ll get you the sweets you want, Fairy, dear. Any special brand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only without chocolate  coating. And thank you lots, Sylvia. You&rsquo;re awful good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t be, you angel!&rdquo; and  Guy clasped her to him and kissed her, quite regardless of another&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do until  time to dress?&rdquo; Sylvia asked, as she left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Fairy, provocatively,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tease Guy. He&rsquo;s so adorable when he&rsquo;s in a rage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still uncertain what to do about  it all, Sylvia went for a motor drive to think things out. She never drove a  car herself, but sat in the corner of her little coupe and watched the  landscape with unseeing eyes as she wondered in what direction her duty lay.</p>
<p>Coming home, she went directly to  her room in the cottage and sent for Guy. He came at once, and she lost no time  in preliminaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to say this,&rdquo; she told  him, &ldquo;because I feel I ought to. Uncle Ralph is not pleased with Fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Guy was a  little indifferent in his manner, &ldquo;I told you so before she came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but Guy, he is really  angry at the engagement, and unless you placate him in some way, there may be  a&mdash;a scene this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad as that?&rdquo; and Guy smiled.  &ldquo;All right, let him make his scene. I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Guy, you must care! Think  what it would mean to have Uncle Ralph stride in with that glower of his and  forbid the banns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can forbid them, but that  won&rsquo;t affect them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will affect your future, your  fortune, your ability to indulge your wife in the luxuries she loves,&mdash;that any  girl of today loves. Guy, you must go to him. You must have a talk. You must  even plead with him, if necessary. You can&rsquo;t take a chance. Think, it would be  a scandal, the press would grab at it, and&mdash;most of all, it would break Fairy&rsquo;s  heart.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ah, she had pierced his armor of  indifference at last!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; he said, and a new  light came into his eyes. &ldquo;Where is Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him in his library. I&rsquo;m  not sure he&rsquo;s there yet. But you hunt him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&mdash;you&rsquo;re a good scout,  Sylly,&rdquo; and with a careless kiss he turned and swung away.</p>
<p>The interview was not a pleasant  one. Without recounting details it is sufficient to say that the two men had a  hard and bitter quarrel.</p>
<p>The father declared that the girl  his son had chosen for a wife was not his equal in any way. That her beauty,  marvelous though it was, could not be held sufficient, when all the best and  finest traits of character were absent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl has no background, no  traditions,&rdquo; stormed the older man. &ldquo;Who were her parents? What was her  father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father is dead,&rdquo; Guy said,  striving to keep his temper. &ldquo;I have met her mother, a dear, sweet refined  little woman. I invited her to come with Fairy, but she was not well enough.  She will come later on. Now, father, I know that you want me to marry  Sylvia,&mdash;were it not for that obsession of yours, I am sure you would look on  Fairy very differently. But, though I love Sylvia, it is not in the way I care  for Fairy. Yet, I know I can never make you understand. It is not in your cold,  Scotch nature. I am like my mother,&mdash;of a warmer heart, a deeper affection, a  more emotional nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave your mother&rsquo;s name out of  this!&rdquo; ordered his father. &ldquo;She would soon size up that silly-pated, baby-faced  chit you have picked up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; and Guy looked like a  thunder cloud. &ldquo;You forbid me to speak my mother&rsquo;s name, very well, I forbid  you to voice any disparagement of the girl I adore, worship and reverence. She  is as good as she is beautiful. If she lacks a college education, she makes up  for it in a naturally quick mind, a fund of general information, and a lovely  and generous-hearted disposition, which your crusty, crabbed nature is  incapable of understanding at all! I&rsquo;m sorry, Dad, to talk like this, but you  drove me to it. Now, can we get together on this, or must it be&mdash;&rdquo; Guy was about  to say &ldquo;war to the knife,&rdquo; when the expression on his father&rsquo;s face stopped  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her, my boy,&rdquo; said Ralph  Mackenzie, in a strained, trembling voice. &ldquo;Your happiness is my only desire in  life. I retract what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he ignored the hand Guy held  out to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b>Chapter 4<a name="Chapter4"></a><br>
  The Dance</b></h2>
<p>The afternoon fete was a wonderful  party.</p>
<p>In addition to the perfect and  capable arrangements made by human hands, nature also gave the benefit of a  rare June day, sunshiny, breezy, and flower-fragrant.</p>
<p>Warlock House was at its best, and  to its always beautiful gardens were added the attractions of a dancing  pavilion and fine orchestra, a spacious supper marquee, and an entertainment  tent with gay shows at intervals.</p>
<p>But the chief attraction was  Fairy,&mdash;the long heralded, eagerly waited for beauty, who would some day be  mistress of the great estate.</p>
<p>Nor was anyone disappointed in the  realization of her charms, for the exquisite little person fully came up to the  most exaggerated expectations.</p>
<p>She wore a short, full frock of  white chiffon, on which was a delicate tracery of silver. No ornaments, except  a graceful diamond pendant, on a slight chain of diamonds, a gift from Guy that  very day.</p>
<p>But her witching face, with its  golden crown of curls needed no ornamentation and as she smiled at each  newcomer, presented to her, one and all capitulated and only murmurs of praise  were heard on every hand.</p>
<p>Yet it is probably true that even  an angel from heaven could not entirely quell the instincts of envy, hatred and  malice that infest the human heart.</p>
<p>And even those who were most  fulsome in their praise at first, lapsed later into more critical mood, and  modified their transports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A marvel face!&rdquo; exclaimed one man  to the girl with him. &ldquo;So sweet and innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;To me  she looks wise,&mdash;even canny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How like a woman! I can read  character, and I tell you that little thing is of the simplest, purest nature&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is generous and loyal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To herself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are impossible! Why do  you want to malign her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t But you are investing her  with all the virtues because she has a pretty face! You don&rsquo;t know her at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope to know her better,  if old Guy will let me. He watches her like a jailer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame him. She&rsquo;d flirt  with anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;ll have a chance at me,  if I can manage it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way that couple  fell out, nor were they alone in their experience.</p>
<p>Almost every man in the place was  rapt in admiration, almost every woman was consumed with jealousy and envy of  this girl.</p>
<p>Yet Fairy was in no way of exotic  effect or bizarre appearance.</p>
<p>A sweet simplicity was her  keynote, and her gracious and unaffected manner was frank and cordial to all.</p>
<p>She stood on the terrace, and  received all who came with smiling welcome.</p>
<p>Guy, at her elbow, feared she  would drop with fatigue, but she stuck to her post.</p>
<p>At last, when it became evident  the guests had all arrived, she let him take her to a seat in a pergola and  bring her some punch and cakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a cigarette,&rdquo; she requested.</p>
<p>A dozen cases were held toward  her, for a group had quickly gathered round her.</p>
<p>Fairy laughed, looked at the  stretched forth array, and closing her eyes waved her hand about and reached  for one at random.</p>
<p>Then, the tension of the reception  over, she waxed gay and merry.</p>
<p>Sylvia, passing, stopped to  listen, and thought she had never seen Fairy in such high spirits.</p>
<p>Her laugh rang out, not loud, but  with a high bell-like quality that was almost uncanny.</p>
<p>Still, the girl did nothing really  wrong, she made no <i>faux pas</i>,  committed no social sin.</p>
<p>But her relaxed position in a  lounge chair was a bit informal; her crossed legs showed a little more abandon  than conservative tastes approved; and her gayety of mood waxed ever toward  unconstraint.</p>
<p>Guy stooped and whispered in her  ear, and she suddenly became willful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, with an  adorable little pout, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll elope with Billy Trigg. Come along. Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang from her chair, grasped  Trigg&rsquo;s arm, and leaning upon it brought her whole battery of smiles to bear  upon his face, as she murmured: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and have a dance, shall us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy was as wax in her hands, and  led her to the dancing pavilion where a Jazz band was playing.</p>
<p>Fairy danced like a fluff of  thistledown and Trigg was an expert. So they danced as long as the music played,  and came to a sudden stop to find Guy awaiting them.</p>
<p>His face was stern, but as Fairy  sidled up to him, and smiled, he forgot all else, and whispered: &ldquo;You little  scamp! You come along with me, and stay with me,&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Guy,&rdquo; and Fairy sighed,  happily. &ldquo;I do love to have you boss me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get bossed, my lady, but  you behave yourself! Get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; and Fairy  laughed outright. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you for keeps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, darling,&rdquo; and the  infatuated young man led her away to a secluded spot, where he could kiss the  lovely laughing face.</p>
<p>A little later, the announcement  of the engagement was made with due formality.</p>
<p>The betrothed pair were toasted,  the champagne was of the best, Guy looked like the prince of happiness and  Fairy was a smiling vision.</p>
<p>Few noticed that Ralph Mackenzie  was not in evidence, until Guy suddenly called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dad? Where&rsquo;s my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Sylvia said, lifting  her glass, gayly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here directly. To Fairy, the Rose-leaf Girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her attempt at diversion was  successful. Guy caught her warning glance and obeyed it. Few others noticed the  incident at all, as they all drank to Sylvia&rsquo;s impromptu toast.</p>
<p>Soon after, the greater part of  the crowd went home, though many who had been invited, stayed for dinner and  the evening&rsquo;s festivities.</p>
<p>Fairy, of her own accord, sought  out Ralph Mackenzie.</p>
<p>He was in his library, and, at her  light tap, he opened the door to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; she said, and  though his dour face did not lighten at sight of her, he stood aside and let  her enter.</p>
<p>Then he closed the door again, and  after giving her a chair, he stood before her, apparently waiting for her to  begin the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo; she began, and then  looked up at him, with such a confiding, wistful expression that his sternness  nearly gave way.</p>
<p>But not quite, and he responded,  quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Lovell, I see a great  deal. More, probably, than you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;And I  understand,&mdash; oh, I am not a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke bitterly, and yet,  somehow, the spasm of pain that crossed her face only made it more appealing,  and Ralph Mackenzie felt an inexplicable, well-nigh irresistible impulse to  take her in his arms and say he would be glad and proud to welcome her as his  son&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>But his was not a nature to yield  to impulse, and he merely waited for further elucidation of her reasons for  coming to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;I  know, I quite understand that you don&rsquo;t like me,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel that?&rdquo; he said,  courteously, as if speaking of a casual matter.</p>
<p>Fairy stared at him. She was not  accustomed to have her advances met like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling anything so  self-evident,&rdquo; she said, spiritedly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s this way, Mr. Mackenzie. I came  here, hoping we could become friends, hoping I could explain some things,&mdash;tell  you some things, that would make you feel a little more kindly toward me. If  not, if you are not disposed to be kind to me, I&mdash;there is nothing more to be  said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She regarded him with a gaze that  was thoughtful and a bit sad.</p>
<p>It was the best attitude she could  have chosen, for while unmoved by anger, impervious to coaxing, and indifferent  to threats, Ralph Mackenzie&rsquo;s innate sense of justice made him feel that this  girl deserved, at least, a hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, in a more  lenient tone, &ldquo;if I have been unduly harsh. May I ask what it is you wish to  explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; and Fairy&rsquo;s attitude  was as full of dignity as his own. &ldquo;I am Guy&rsquo;s choice. I love him and he loves  me. As his father, you have a right to your own opinions about his choice, but  you have not a right to forbid him to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I have a right to  disinherit him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course.&rdquo; Fairy&rsquo;s shrug  of indifference was superb. &ldquo;I am not marrying him for his money, though  doubtless a man of your mentality would think that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mackenzie ignored this thrust, and  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we are speaking frankly,  then, I will say that I do not think you are my son&rsquo;s equal in birth, in  breeding or in education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, but your opinion on  those matters carries no weight with either Guy or myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mackenzie stared.</p>
<p>He admired pluck when he saw it;  it interested him that this chit of a girl should stand up to him, &mdash;Ralph  Mackenzie, a power in all the circles in which he moved! It was extraordinary.  She must have some background, to possess this trait, this characteristic.</p>
<p>And she was very beautiful. Far  more so to him, in this moment of her daring, than she had ever seemed before.</p>
<p>He smiled and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we bury the hatchet&mdash;Fairy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The surprise was so great, the  reaction so sudden, that she burst into uncontrollable sobs.</p>
<p>Whereupon Ralph Mackenzie did take  her in his arms, and wiped away her tears and patted her shoulder, with just  the same gestures he had used toward Guy about two score years ago.</p>
<p>Fairy smiled through her last  remaining tears, and said, gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I call you Dad? My own daddy  died so long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may, little girl,&rdquo;  he responded. &ldquo;Run along, now, Guy will be looking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Fairy ran along.</p>
<p>Later, at dinner, she was most  demure. She sat, by choice, at the right of Mackenzie, Senior, leaving Guy to  select his own guest of honor.</p>
<p>She was dear and sweet, and nobody  could have found a flaw in her behavior, even had they been so minded.</p>
<p>Guy was so relieved and happy that  all was well between his two dear ones that he willingly gave her over to sit  at his father&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>In the course of conversation,  Mackenzie chanced to mention his fine cattle and his model dairy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goody!&rdquo; cried Fairy, &ldquo;can I  have milk to drink, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say so! Want some  now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not now, but later&mdash;as a  nightcap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl! I have a glass every  night on my bedside table. It&rsquo;s the best soporific there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that, too,&rdquo; and Fairy  nodded her curly head.</p>
<p>After dinner the heroine of the  occasion was again claimed by the young people and Ralph Mackenzie, his ideas  of his new daughter-in-law completely revised, sat quietly at one side of the  great hall, watching the revelry.</p>
<p>There was dancing, of course, and  as the gayety rose to greater heights there were stunts remindful of the old  college days.</p>
<p>Fairy, excited by the music and  fun, offered to do a fancy dance, and as the proposition was hailed with glee,  ran across to her room in the cottage to don a costume for it.</p>
<p>Guy went with her, and so happy was  he in her reconciliation with his father, he scarce thought of warning her  against overdoing her part.</p>
<p>He did say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, darling. We&rsquo;re rather  quiet folk in this house, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Fairy only smiled at him, gave  him a kiss and told him to wait in the hall while she dressed.</p>
<p>Obediently he waited, and in a few  moments she reappeared, draped in a long and voluminous white cloak.</p>
<p>They went back to the house, and  still with her soft cloak about her, Fairy entered the hall and paused to give  the musicians some instructions. </p>
<p>To Billy Trigg she handed a  mysterious something, with more whispered directions.</p>
<p>Then, even yet enveloped in the  white cloak, she ran to the center of the room, and as the music, struck up a  blare of jazz, she flung off the cloak and danced a quick pirouette.</p>
<p>Those who saw her, gasped, and at  once the room was full of murmurs of admiration or sounds of disapproval.</p>
<p>For Fairy was attired in the most  daring costume, or lack of costume, that most of those present had ever seen.</p>
<p>Laced sandals but no stockings  showed her lovely flesh, as a short frill of chiffon did duty for a skirt.</p>
<p>Above the waistline she wore  nothing but a jeweled breastplate, and the effect, though exquisitely  beautiful, was startling in that atmosphere.</p>
<p>In a New York midnight theater it  would have been appropriate, even in some of the neighboring homes, but at  Warlock House, it was so grotesquely out of place that everybody looked  intuitively at Ralph Mackenzie.</p>
<p>But nothing could be learned from  that face.</p>
<p>He sat, as quietly as a graven  image, his countenance calm, even smiling a little. Those who did not know him  well, thought him interested and not disapproving, and modeling their attitude  on his own, they returned to the contemplation of the scene.</p>
<p>Fairy danced like an houri, with a  grace of posture and a rhythm of movement that held her audience spellbound.</p>
<p>Had she worn a little more  clothing, there would have been nothing to censure, for the dance was in no way  a suggestive one, merely a graceful swirling like the flutter of a butterfly.</p>
<p>But to those who knew the master  of the house better, his calm face was more indicative, and both Guy and Sylvia  knew what that stony smile meant.</p>
<p>They exchanged anxious looks and  quickly looked away again, nor did their glances meet any more.</p>
<p>Wilder grew the music, faster flew  the dancer, never losing her perfect poise or her true sense of rhythm.</p>
<p>It was no set dance, the veriest  novice could see that. She was improvising, letting herself go; as a captive  bird, freed, would soar.</p>
<p>She seemed to forget her audience,  she never glanced at Guy or at anyone else, she danced,&mdash; danced,&mdash;like a wild  sprite of the woods, like a mystic dryad, like a flame of living fire.</p>
<p>At last, the music slowed down,  became softer, and,&mdash;for what she had given Billy Trigg was a colored spotlight,&mdash;lovely,  faint tints played upon her, a soft glow enveloped her quivering flesh, and she  sank down, a perfect picture, before them.</p>
<p>The music ceased, and in a moment,  she rose, smiled, and blowing kisses from her pearly finger tips, she stepped  backward.</p>
<p>Guy stood, waiting to receive her,  her cloak spread wide to envelop her, but she eluded him, and running to the  nearest man, she cried, &ldquo;Dance with me!&rdquo; and nodded to the musicians. </p>
<p>Dancing became general, and then  Guy, with a white, set face, and still holding Fairy&rsquo;s cloak, went to her and  took her bodily away from the man she was dancing with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cut in!&rdquo; she said, laughing and  laying her hand on Guy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Come with  me, don&rsquo;t say a word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrapped her cloak around her  and then picking her light form up in his arms, he hurried her across the lawns  to the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you doing?&rdquo; she said,  pettishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; he  said, at his wits&rsquo; end. &ldquo;Will you stay here, Fairy? Will you go to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to bed? Are you crazy? Why  should I go to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you have disgraced me,  you have disgraced us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Guy?&rdquo; she clasped him to her  and began to cry. &ldquo;And I thought I was dancing so prettily,&mdash; and entertaining  your guests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You entertained them all right!&rdquo;  said Guy, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&mdash;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fairy, dear,&rdquo; he was all  unnerved at her tone of contrition, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know <i>anything!</i> Where did you get  that costume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That? Oh, I had it for&mdash;for a  fancy dress once,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a fancy dress party? You  didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. Everybody thought it  was lovely! Guy, if you&rsquo;re going to scold me, I will go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better, dear. I&rsquo;ll  send Jenny. Or would you rather have Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t care. I  just want you. Guy, darling, don&rsquo;t be cross to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I love you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Guy, unable to do otherwise,  said that, and more like it, and at last, Sylvia venturing to come over, found  them sitting on the sofa in the cottage hall, with, apparently no flaw in their  happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy, you&rsquo;d better go back now,&rdquo;  Sylvia said, gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after Fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the ring of her voice  advised Guy to obey, and after a few words of good night, he went back to his  party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I suppose you&rsquo;re going to  scold,&rdquo; Fairy said to Sylvia.</p>
<p>There was no trace of petulance in  her voice, only a sort of resignation to further bothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; said Sylvia, who  was just about at the end of her rope. &ldquo;But what possessed you, Fairy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possessed me?&rdquo; and Fairy looked  bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; why did you dance in that  terrible rig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible! I think it&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; said Sylvia. &ldquo;Come on,  now, let me get you to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jenny? I want a bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run you a bath. Jenny&rsquo;s busy  at the other house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can run it myself. Here,  I&rsquo;ll squeeze into this kimono, and hop it to the bathroom. Has Dad gone to  bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia flinched at the name Dad,  from this strange young person, but she said only, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and it  doesn&rsquo;t matter. Run along now. Lock the bathroom door, and I&rsquo;ll wait for you  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerson came into Fairy&rsquo;s  room, as Sylvia waited there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s she?&rdquo; the woman asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her bath,&rdquo; said Sylvia. &ldquo;Have  you poured Uncle Ralph&rsquo;s milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Sylvia, I left a  glassful on his night table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pour a glass for Miss  Lovell, too. She likes it at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerson obeyed, and soon Fairy  reappeared, fresh and rosy from her bath and so sweet and affectionate that  Sylvia&rsquo;s heart warmed toward her. Could she be a wanton little thing? Or only  nature&rsquo;s own child, lacking proper training, but with undeveloped possibilities  for good?</p>
<p>At any rate, Sylvia could not  resist her charm, and she kissed her good night and tucked her up in bed as she  would a tired child.</p>
<p>She longed to go to bed herself,  but she must not desert Guy. He needed her to bid his guests good night.</p>
<p>So she went back and after a time  the party was over and only the house guests remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to go in the morning,&rdquo;  Hal Masterson said to Sylvia. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a bully party, and we&rsquo;d love to stay  over till Monday, but it can&rsquo;t be did. So Helena and I will say good-by. Give  our farewells to the little lady. How wonderfully well she dances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she does,&rdquo; said Sylvia,  taking the cue. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a positive genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the last guest had gone and  the house was darkened, Ralph Mackenzie stepped from his library and sought  Guy.</p>
<p>He found him, with a few cronies,  smoking a final pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you a few minutes, later on,  son,&rdquo; said the father, and Guy nodded.</p>
<p>But it was with a heavy heart that  he kept the tryst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dad,&rdquo; he opened the talk  himself, &ldquo;I suppose I know pretty well what you&rsquo;re going to say. Now, how would  it be, if we postponed our discussion until tomorrow? We&rsquo;d both be better for a  night&rsquo;s sleep and, too, you know&mdash;the night brings counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked at his son,  thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, boy. Maybe  you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am, Dad,&rdquo; Guy was  rejoiced at the respite. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;d really like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, out with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would be, to postpone our talk  until the house party is over. Couldn&rsquo;t you bring yourself to wait till Monday  for our confab? I&rsquo;m pretty much all in, with the crowd here and&mdash;and your  attitude,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, my lad, I do see,&rdquo; and  Ralph Mackenzie, with his big sense of justice suddenly did see the strain his  son was laboring under, and realized that he did not want to add to the burden.  &ldquo;Well, suppose then, that we wait until Monday&mdash;are they all going on the  Monday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is invited to stay longer  than that, except Fairy herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy looked up at his father as he  spoke the name, but the elder man&rsquo;s eyes were on the ground, and their glances  did not meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it, then, Guy. I will say  no word to you of the matter nearest my heart, until your guests have left  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Dad. And you&mdash;you will  be kind to Fairy,&mdash;to my little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to be kind to her,&rdquo;  said Ralph Mackenzie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The Pearls</b></h2>
<p>Sunday was another rare and  perfect June day.</p>
<p>Warlock House stood, stately and  imposing, in the midst of its gardens, lawns and surrounding woodland.</p>
<p>Sylvia, dressed, tapped at Fairy&rsquo;s  door and was answered by a sleepy, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the door was locked and  calling out, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get up, I&rsquo;ll come in by the window,&rdquo; Sylvia ran out the  front door and along the verandah to the French window of Fairy&rsquo;s room, which  stood ajar.</p>
<p>From the downy pillows, the  touseled golden head peeped out, and smiling blue eyes greeted Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to say it&rsquo;s  morning! Why, Sylvia, I haven&rsquo;t been asleep half an hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have, many half hours.  Now you must get up or Guy will be over here hunting you. Did you drink your  milk? Yes, I see you did. Wasn&rsquo;t it good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I never tasted such  milk. Say, Sylvie, will the people like me today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia saw her chance and  determined to take it. But she temporized a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning the guests or the  family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the family. I can manage the  guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the family, I suppose you  mean Uncle Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, you&rsquo;ve just about hit  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, to be frank, I&rsquo;ll say that  it&rsquo;s up to you. You can cajole any man, Fairy, but with Uncle Ralph, you&rsquo;ve got  to be a little careful, or&mdash;he won&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; Fairy was running  a comb through her curls and she tossed her head defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do care. Please  care, Fairy,&mdash;you must&mdash;for Guy&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy adores me, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it breaks his heart that  his father doesn&rsquo;t adore you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right. What must I do? Go  to church today and sing psalms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia laughed at the  sanctimonious face Fairy pulled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, not quite that, but you  must,&rdquo; she looked grave, &ldquo;you must be a little more careful of your behavior.  Your dance last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go back to that! I know  what you want,&mdash;I understand. And I don&rsquo;t mean to let myself go, but&mdash;oh, my  goodness, Sylvia, I don&rsquo;t believe I can live up to Warlock House!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you can, either,&rdquo;  and Sylvia looked at her with serious eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must!&rdquo; and Fairy&rsquo;s tone was  almost piteous. &ldquo;I love Guy so,&mdash;I&rsquo;d love his father, if he&rsquo;d let me. But he&rsquo;s  old, and I&rsquo;m young&mdash;<i>young!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half dressed, in her dainty  lingerie, Fairy executed a wild dance, that almost took Sylvia&rsquo;s breath away.</p>
<p>She watched, spellbound, as Fairy  flew, like a windblown sprite from one side of the room to the other and then,  pirouetting from a corner, landed at Sylvia&rsquo;s feet and knelt there in an  attitude of lovely suppliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be good to me, Sylvie,&rdquo; she  begged. &ldquo;Please, be good to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little rascal!&rdquo; Sylvia cried,  torn between admiration and the necessity she felt for being stern, &ldquo;where did  you learn to dance like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t learn,&rdquo; said Fairy, going  on with her toilette. &ldquo;Always knew. Born so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was your mother a dancer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma! Lordy, no!&rdquo; And Fairy  laughed at the idea. &ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s a little brown-mousy sort of person. Guy&rsquo;s Dad  would love her! Almost a Puritan or a Quaker or a Shaker or whatever they call  those prim strait-laced folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like your father, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. Don&rsquo;t remember Daddy. He  died when I was a tiny mite. Now, I&rsquo;m ready, and Sylvia, I will try to behave  good and proper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Sylvia escorted a very demure  and correct little person across the lawns and they entered the dining room of  the big house with dignity and decorum.</p>
<p>A shout of greeting went up from  those already assembled at breakfast there, and even Ralph Mackenzie conjured  up a smile of welcome.</p>
<p>Fairy flashed him a look of  gratitude and appreciation and took the seat Guy held for her, next himself.</p>
<p>After breakfast, everybody  followed his own sweet will, and declining to play golf or tennis, Fairy  established court on the terrace and made good her promise to Sylvia to behave  herself.</p>
<p>Later she went for a long walk  with Guy, and so sweet was she, so appealing in her youth and enthusiasm, that  he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to say a word about the dance the night before.</p>
<p>Yet he knew he must forestall any  repetition of the performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish your mother could have  come with you,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, too, but the poor dear has  such a cold, and I was afraid it might run into grippe or something. Perhaps  she can come out here tomorrow. How long am I to stay, Guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you will, darling. If  your mother can come tomorrow, by all means have her do so. The crowd will all  leave this afternoon or tomorrow morning, and we&rsquo;ll have a lovely time all by  ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Dad will be nice to me,  won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you behave yourself!&rdquo; Guy  smiled at her. &ldquo;No more fancy dancing, if you please! You see, we are a  conservative lot,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought everything went on  Long Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. Everything does  go on Long island. Even old-fashioned ways of looking at things. My father is a  law unto himself. He&rsquo;s one of the few remaining relics of a former generation,  and he glories in maintaining his lifelong traditions, narrow and intolerant  though they may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be your grandfather,  Guy. He&rsquo;s too far back for one generation before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfectly true, dear. Most  of the fellows&rsquo; fathers are nearly as up to date as their sons. But Dad isn&rsquo;t,  and that&rsquo;s all there is about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. And I&rsquo;m going to be so  discreet and so unsophisticated he&rsquo;ll just adore me. But when we are married,  he won&rsquo;t have to live with us, will he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to say, dear,&rdquo; but  a slight shadow crossed Guy&rsquo;s bright face, a shadow which, observed by Fairy,  was quickly banished as she turned and held up her inimitable lips for a kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be thankful,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t plaster my face with make-up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; he said, fervently.  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need it, but lots of girls who don&rsquo;t need it persist in using it.  You bet I&rsquo;m thankful for that, dearest.&rdquo; And then their talk became entirely  personal and Fairy&rsquo;s deportment was dropped from consideration.</p>
<p>In the afternoon there was a  shower. So indoors they went and Fairy proposed that she be shown over the  house.</p>
<p>She asked Ralph Mackenzie to take  her, but he declared he was too old and decrepit for the exertion, and deputed  the task to Guy.</p>
<p>Many of the others joined the  excursion, for Warlock House had many rooms of interest beside those in common  use.</p>
<p>They trooped all over the great  building, and it took most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Wanting to do things thoroughly,  Fairy asked to go to the guest house, too. The shower was over, and they  strolled along the path to the other house, built solely for the purpose of  entertaining large house parties.</p>
<p>Though beautiful and perfectly  appointed, it had not the charm or interest of the main building, and Fairy  soon tired of it.</p>
<p>She looked into several of the  bedrooms, gazed at the view from some of the windows, and admired the tasteful  furnishings, paused for a few moments in this room or that, as some woman in  the party called attention to some personal matter of her own, and then they  went back to Warlock House for tea and talk.</p>
<p>Never, it seemed, would the  reunited college chums run out of material for their reminiscent discussions.</p>
<p>And as this was the last  afternoon, they talked incessantly, to the exclusion of the feminine element.</p>
<p>That is, with the exception of  Fairy.</p>
<p>She had, as always, a crowd of men  gathered round her, hanging on her words, gazing at her face and listening for  her laughter.</p>
<p>Incidentally, too, watching for  the appearance of her dimples.</p>
<p>These, two bewitching and  evanescent pitfalls of delight, were not always in evidence. It was only when  Fairy was blissfully happy, and was enjoying herself to the utmost that they  suddenly came out like a flash of sunlight after shower.</p>
<p>So the infatuated men who watched  her, endeavored to say some bit of pleasantry or spring a sudden quip that  should surprise her into dimpling.</p>
<p>Yet withal, Fairy was in perfect  accord with the atmosphere of Warlock House.</p>
<p>Now and then, she looked toward  Ralph Mackenzie, as if in quest of some sign of approval or appreciation of her  good behavior, but that gentleman was seemingly unaware of her presence, and  though neither morose nor silent, he kept himself to himself.</p>
<p>Guy watched his father furtively,  but though there was an undercurrent of unease, there was no lack of courtesy  or graciousness in the older man&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>Later, as the girls were dressing  for dinner, Sylvia came into Fairy&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were perfectly sweet, this  afternoon, dear,&rdquo; she said, for she felt that perhaps a bit of well-merited  praise would make for safety in the evening.</p>
<p>And the wise Sylvia was none too  sure that the volatile little personality before her, would not break loose  again after this repression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have you say that,  Sylvie,&rdquo; Fairy returned, her blue eyes full of gratitude. &ldquo;Honest, I want to be  good, but&mdash;Guy&rsquo;s Dad wouldn&rsquo;t look at me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, you just imagined  that. You keep right on being good, and see how he warms up this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sylvia mentally jotted down  the fact that she must remark to Ralph Mackenzie on the advisability of such a  course.</p>
<p>Fairy went on dressing, aided and  abetted by the assiduous Jenny, who was her willing and devoted slave.</p>
<p>Servants always adored Fairy. Her  gay kindliness to them, and her apologetic air when she made extra work for  them, which she was always doing, brought them worshiping, to her feet.</p>
<p>Even silent, shrewd Ezra Gerson,  the head gardener, unbent a little when he chanced to see Fairy running about  in his house, while Abbie, his wife, as she said, herself, was clean daft about  her.</p>
<p>At last, Jenny pronounced her  lovely charge finished, and a bewitching figure in soft, silky velvet of a  vivid scarlet, with stockings and slippers to match, took Jenny&rsquo;s arm to run  across the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gerson,  &ldquo;lemme look at the little queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared, enthralled, as Fairy  did a little dance for her delectation, and when the smiling girl ran away, the  good woman turned, to see her husband standing behind her in the shadows of the  hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see her?&rdquo; she cried.  &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she the wonder, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Abbie,&mdash;yes, yes,&mdash;the young  lady is a wonder. But, I don&rsquo;t get her&mdash;I don&rsquo;t get her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean you don&rsquo;t  understand her,&rdquo; scoffed his wife. &ldquo;And small wonder. She&rsquo;s not for the likes  of you to understand. She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Gerson wanted to say unique, but was  unacquainted with the word, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s in a class by herself, like. Yes, alone by  herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all of that! I never saw  her twin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And considering that his statement  concluded the matter, he went about his business.</p>
<p>When Fairy reached the big house,  she found a state of commotion there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked  Billy Trigg, as, unable to see Guy about, she appealed directly to the man she  liked next best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a terrible thing! Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s  pearl necklace is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious! Where&rsquo;s it gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows. It may have been  stolen, or it may have slipped from her throat, and be round the place  somewhere, or it may be merely mislaid among her own things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t usually mislay a  pearl necklace! I suppose then, they are real pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet they are! To the tune of  two hundred thousand dollars, or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy Trigg! Not really! Do  pearls ever cost as much as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do. And Dorothy&rsquo;s did.  Oh, of course they&rsquo;ll turn up. But it&rsquo;s a messy thing to happen. Poor old Guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s Guy got to do with  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that it&rsquo;s in his house. I  suppose we&rsquo;ll all have to be searched and such horrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should anyone mind being  searched? You can&rsquo;t suspect one of the guests and if it was one of the servants  they ought to be shown up. Mightn&rsquo;t it have been a burglar? You know, after-dinner  robbers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just a name. I&rsquo;ve  read in the papers about Long Island houses being robbed by thieves who come  while the people are at dinner. This may have been a teatime thief. What are  they going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. Of course  nobody wants to call in the police until it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary, but &mdash;well,  here comes Guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy, naturally, was in search of  Fairy, and he took her aside and whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, pet. We&rsquo;re going to  hush up the thing all we can, and not let it interfere with our evening&rsquo;s  pleasure. If you have any places locked in your room, give the keys to Jenny.  There must be a search, and everybody must submit to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Fairy said, &ldquo;but I  haven&rsquo;t anything locked up, dear. My trunk and suit cases are all open, and if  not, Jenny knows where she put the keys. This lovely pendant you gave me, and my  engagement ring, I have on, and those are all the jewels I have, except some  trinkets in the top bureau drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, Jenny will see  to it all. Now come and get a cocktail and then we&rsquo;ll have dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fairy sat by Guy, for Ralph  Mackenzie looked forbidding and unapproachable.</p>
<p>She was in a quiet but happy mood.  Guy had bade her not to worry about the missing pearls, and so she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But later on, when a thorough  search of the guests&rsquo; belongings had failed to bring them to light, somebody proposed  that the guests and family and servants all be subjected to a personal search.</p>
<p>A few objected, but their  remonstrance was quickly overcome, by the ones who declared that was the only  way to free all from suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a lark,&rdquo; Fairy confided  to Billy Trigg, and as the stately housekeeper, Mrs. Maxwell was summoned for  the purpose, accompanied by a trusted maid, the women were ushered into the  music room, while the men were herded into the ballroom.</p>
<p>But the most meticulous and  painstaking search of every human being within the precincts of Warlock House  brought forth no solution of the mystery.</p>
<p>The pearls were not found, and no  one evinced any guilty confusion or any sign of nervousness or embarrassment.</p>
<p>As Fairy had said, it seemed like  a lark, and willingly the men turned out their pockets and removed their  clothing, while in another room the women were subjected to equally complete  investigation.</p>
<p>The evening was well spent by the  time this was over, and when the musicians struck up their lively notes, many  were too wearied to care for dancing.</p>
<p>These went off to the smoking room  or lounge, while others welcomed the dance as a pleasant diversion.</p>
<p>Guy drew Fairy into his arms, and  as they danced he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do anything bizarre or  unconventional tonight, will you, dear? I&rsquo;ve about all I can stand with this  other trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I&rsquo;d ever be a trouble to  you, darling,&rdquo; she returned, her soft cheek against his own.</p>
<p>Later, she sought out Ralph  Mackenzie, determined to do her part toward keeping the peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you how sorry I  am,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that you have had such an unpleasant incident to mar this  lovely party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke a little timidly, for  Mackenzie was not smiling, but her voice rang with sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your sympathy,&rdquo; he  said, courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad,&rdquo; she cried, impulsively,  holding out her roseleaf hands and looking at him with an imploring glance,  &ldquo;you said I might call you Dad, please love me a little, because I love Guy  so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;m going to  ask you to postpone any questions relative to you and Guy, until after the  guests leave here, tomorrow. I told Guy I would do this,&mdash;at his request,&mdash;and,  too, I have grave matters on my mind just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you have. I&rsquo;m sorry I  intruded. What do you suppose happened to Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose,&mdash;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I will ask you not to  repeat that statement, please. Perhaps tomorrow will bring forth the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Fairy, and then,  chilled and a little awed by Mackenzie&rsquo;s aloofness and self-absorption, she  merely said good night, and left him.</p>
<p>The short interview had occurred  in the small library, and as Fairy emerged, Guy came to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you were in  there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How is Dad behaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems distrait,&rdquo; Fairy  replied. &ldquo;Not nervous or worried, exactly, but more perplexed, as if he was  uncertain what to do next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder! Poor old Dad, he  takes this robbery as a blot on our &rsquo;scutcheon. Lord knows, I feel bad enough  about it, but that drastic search cleared all of the people here. It must have  been the work of skilled and experienced burglars,&mdash;yet, not so much skill was  necessary, either, for the necklace was lying on Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s dressing table all  day, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What carelessness!&rdquo; cried Fairy,  in a shocked voice. &ldquo;If I owned a thing like that, I should keep it in safe  deposit most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does, dear. She brought it  out here to honor our party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then left it lying around  loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she isn&rsquo;t used to the  care of it. Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll have to get the police on the job tomorrow, but it  mustn&rsquo;t entirely spoil our last evening of the party, so if you&rsquo;ll help me,  dear, we&rsquo;ll try to stir up things a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did, with such good results  that all present, unless, perhaps, Dorothy Reed and her husband, flung care  aside and gave themselves up to a real revel.</p>
<p>Fairy was sweet and dear. Gay, of  course, and merry, even flirtatious, but in no way beyond the bounds of decorum  or even conventionality.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie, watching her, was  forced to the conclusion she could be a lovely, charming hostess as well as a  daring Bacchante, which was the way he characterized her dance of the night  before.</p>
<p>And then, with further regretful  and sympathetic speeches to the unfortunate Mrs. Reed, and sincere hopes that  her valuable necklace would be restored to her, the guests dispersed to their  rooms and Guy escorted Fairy over to the cottage.</p>
<p>Sylvia had preceded her, and met  her at the door.</p>
<p>The girls said good night to Guy  and went into Fairy&rsquo;s room for a short confab. It was mostly about the missing  pearls, and both girls were filled with amazement that anybody could be so  careless with jewels of such value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have happened while we were  at tea,&rdquo; Fairy said, and Sylvia agreed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerson came in with Fairy&rsquo;s  glass of milk, and she paused for a few words about the robbery.</p>
<p>But they were of no weight, and  then Sylvia departed to her own room, and Jenny came to look after Fairy.</p>
<p>But after she had removed Fairy&rsquo;s  evening dress and scarlet shoes, the girl declared she wasn&rsquo;t ready for bed,  and asking for a negligee and slippers, she dismissed Jenny and said she would  read for a while and then would drink her milk and get into bed at her leisure.</p>
<p>So Jenny, with an adoring glance  at the little blue-robed figure curled up in an easy chair, said good night and  went away.</p>
<p>Fairy after reading a few moments  dropped her book and sat thinking until she grew sleepy.</p>
<p>Concluding she would go to bed,  she rose to lock the door and window, when she was startled to see a face  outside the pane.</p>
<p>It was a French window that opened  on the front verandah.</p>
<p>From its side windows the room  received ventilation enough and as the French window afforded such easy  ingress, Fairy always locked it at night.</p>
<p>Affrighted at first by the  appearance of a face, she recognized in an instant that it was Guy himself, and  smiled at him in her sudden relief.</p>
<p>Not knowing exactly what to do,  she whispered good night, and made as if to lock the window.</p>
<p>But his gesture forbade her, and  he motioned for her to let him come in. She opened the long window a trifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she whispered,  looking adorable in her pale blue gown, its loose chiffon sleeves falling away  from her soft baby arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me come in,&rdquo; he said,  hoarsely, devouring her with his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in! Guy, are you crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I am. Anyhow, let me  in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t come in. You ask me  to be conventional, and then you come here when everybody is in bed! Go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said, tensely. &ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t go away until you give me one kiss! Just one, darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Oh, do go away, some one  will see you or hear you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will if you don&rsquo;t do as I  say. Open that window, or I&rsquo;ll break it open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window was already open a  small distance, enough to let them converse, but it was held by a chain inside,  which, unless undone by Fairy, denied Guy access.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, only one kiss&mdash;then.  Promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Guy said, eagerly.  &ldquo;Undo that chain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Fairy slipped the chain from  its socket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  The Tragedy</b></h2>
<p>And then it was Monday morning.</p>
<p>The guests of Guy&rsquo;s house party  rose and dressed with a feeling of regret that the last day of this delightful  experience had dawned.</p>
<p>Most of them had no knowledge of  the friction that disturbed the family regarding the engagement of Guy and  Fairy, and though all knew of the pearl robbery and condoled sincerely with  Dorothy Reed, they assured her with a sublime if unfounded faith, that she  would get her necklace back.</p>
<p>Naturally, the household were  greatly upset over the robbery, but after the complete search of the guests and  their rooms and belongings, there seemed no conclusion possible except to  believe that a clever climbing thief, or cat burglar as the English call him,  had obtained access to Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s room, while tea was being served.</p>
<p>The men mostly came early to the  breakfast room, and Guy received their acknowledgments of his hospitality and  their offers of any help they might give with his usual gay and pleasant  courtesy, but he longed for the time when they should all be gone, and he  steeled himself to preserve his usual calm until their departure.</p>
<p>The women came over from the guest  house, and then Ralph Mackenzie appeared, having walked over from the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dad,&rdquo; Guy greeted him.  &ldquo;Where are the girls? Sylvia is usually about earlier than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mackenzie disclaimed any knowledge  of his fellow lodgers and turned his attention to his breakfast.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Sylvia, at  that moment was knocking loudly on Fairy&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>And was receiving no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy, dear,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;come,  it&rsquo;s time to get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerson came into the hall,  and looked at Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t she say nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked the  woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t understand it. She&rsquo;s  usually awake at this time, though she hates to get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll skitter around and peek in  at the winder,&rdquo; proposed Abbie Gerson, and she went out the front door, and  looked in at the French window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she came back  and reported. &ldquo;The silk curtain covers the panes and the winder is locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go round to the side window,&rdquo;  advised Sylvia, and as the woman disappeared, Sylvia ran quickly into her own  room, and hastily snatched something from her dresser.</p>
<p>Having no pocket, she caught up a  small velvet bag, and was just snapping it shut when Mrs. Gerson reappeared,  quite out of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you be! Well, Miss  Sylvia, I could see in the side winder, but I couldn&rsquo;t glimpse the bed, &mdash;sorta  cornerwise, you know. But, there was no sign of Miss Lovell bein&rsquo; up. Her  negglejay was just flung on a chair, and her little blue slippers were sprawled  in the middle of the room, like she&rsquo;d kicked them off after she got into bed.  Well, what&rsquo;ll we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get into the room,&rdquo; said  Sylvia, positively. &ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s ill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not her! Young folks don&rsquo;t have  strokes or things like that. Nope, she&rsquo;s only asleep,&mdash;sleepin&rsquo; the sleep of the  just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must waken her,&rdquo; and  again Sylvia pounded on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake, what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;  on?&rdquo; exclaimed Ezra Gerson, coming in from the kitchen part of the house.  &ldquo;Noise enough here to deafen a body! Oh, Miss Sylvia,&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know you was  here! I jest thought it was that wife of mine rampoosin&rsquo; about. Whatever is the  matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t seem to waken Miss  Lovell,&rdquo; Sylvia told him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so sound asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ezra Gerson looked grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if that  hullabaloo didn&rsquo;t rouse her! She must be doped or suthin. Shall I bust in, Miss  Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps we&rsquo;d  better send for Mr. Guy first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use stirrin&rsquo; him up,&rdquo; said  Abbie Gerson, &ldquo;and likewise there&rsquo;s no use breakin&rsquo; in doors or messin&rsquo; up more  &rsquo;n need be. You try to force the lock on the front winder, Ez, and if you  can&rsquo;t, then go around to the side ones and try to climb in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;t&rsquo; climb in to  no young lady&rsquo;s room. She wouldn&rsquo;t thank me to do that. But I can bust that  triflin&rsquo; catch on the French window, and then you women can go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three of them went out on the  verandah, and with a mighty push, Gerson forced the bolts and threw open the  long glass doors.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerson went in first, and  Sylvia hung back at the sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Abbie,  &ldquo;come in here, Miss Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, almost unwillingly, Sylvia  went in, and standing by Mrs. Gerson&rsquo;s side looked down at Fairy as she lay on  the bed.</p>
<p>Sylvia caught her breath as she  gazed, for surely no fairer picture had ever been seen by mortal eyes.</p>
<p>The posture was that of graceful  abandon, and one white arm, outflung across a lacy pillow, looked so alive and  convenient Mrs. Gerson bent over to grasp it and give the girl a gentle shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Sylvia, clutching  at her hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch her! She&rsquo;s dead! Can&rsquo;t you see she&rsquo;s dead? Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And clasping her own hands across  her breast, Sylvia stared at the lovely, motionless figure before her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerson fell back in affright,  Ezra Gerson, hearing from where he stood just outside the window, was  transfixed. And still Sylvia stood, as deathly quiet as Fairy herself.</p>
<p>The exquisite face had lost its  pink flush, but it seemed even more beautiful in its waxy whiteness, and the  gold curls, ringleted like a baby&rsquo;s, as they always were when Fairy woke in the  morning, clustered round the shapely little head.</p>
<p>A filmy nightdress of chiffon and  delicate embroidery half veiled the perfect neck and shoulders, and Fairy  looked like a tired child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not dead!&rdquo; Mrs. Gerson  was mumbling, beside herself with shock and terror. &ldquo;Come in here, Ez,&rdquo; she  commanded, her dependence on her man blotting out all thought of propriety or  conventionality.</p>
<p>Hesitantly, Gerson stepped across  the window sill and advanced a few steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; he breathed in enforced  admiration, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t she beautiful! And dead? Yes, Abbie, Miss Sylvia&rsquo;s right,  the young lady is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None had touched her, but now all  three realized beyond doubt that Fairy was dead.</p>
<p>How? Why? Who? were problems that  must come later.</p>
<p>The present and immediate question  was what to do now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Mr. Guy,&rdquo; said Sylvia,  authoritatively, and the two Gersons looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t much on going to the big  house,&rdquo; Ezra said, slowly, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s that Jenny? Can&rsquo;t you send her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny&rsquo;s gone to her breakfast,&rdquo;  Sylvia told him. &ldquo;I let her go, and I said I&rsquo;d maid Miss Lovell this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Guy must be got over  here, right now,&rdquo; Gerson said. &ldquo;If you say for me to go after him, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go into the dining  room,&rdquo; Sylvia said, sorry for his evident shyness and awkwardness. &ldquo;Just go to  the kitchen or pantry, and tell Crane to ask Mr. Guy to come over here at  once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once started, Gerson carried out  his orders faithfully, and it was but a few moments before Guy came striding  in.</p>
<p>Sylvia met him in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck up, Guy dear,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need all your courage, all your bravery,&mdash;Fairy is&mdash;is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is what?&rdquo; he demanded, harshly.  &ldquo;Is what, Sylvia? Ill?&mdash;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the last word, she stared at  him. Why did he say that? Then, she nodded her head, but by this time he was in  Fairy&rsquo;s room, and elbowing Mrs. Gerson aside, he looked down at the girl on the  bed.</p>
<p>A lump rose in his throat, he  tried to speak once or twice but failed to make a sound.</p>
<p>But those futile efforts and an  involuntary clenching of his hands were the only signs of emotion he showed.</p>
<p>The others stood waiting; Sylvia,  her eyes fixed on Fairy&rsquo;s face, the two Gersons, outwardly the embodiment of  respect and deference, but really, alertly watching Guy&rsquo;s every movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure she is&mdash;she is&mdash;&rdquo;  Guy&rsquo;s husky voice gave out entirely, and Sylvia tried to help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Guy, she is dead,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure  of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a way to test&mdash;to  try&mdash;Mrs. Gerson, get a hand mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke spasmodically, in a sort  of jerky, uncertain way, and his eyes rolled round from one to another of the  little group.</p>
<p>Then he caught the gleam of  interest in Ezra Gerson&rsquo;s glance, and he suddenly straightened himself up and  became again the master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it before her lips,&rdquo; he said  to Mrs. Gerson, and she looked up at him quickly, surprised at his steadied  voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no moisture,&rdquo; the woman  said, after a moment. &ldquo;She is dead, Mr. Guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is. Now, Sylvia, we will  take charge here. I do not want my father brought into it any more than is  absolutely necessary. The poor man is almost ill now, with the various  distracting circumstances of the house party. The pearl robbery has upset his  nerves, because he feels, in a way, responsible. Also, Fairy&rsquo;s advent brought  about some unpleasantness, and now this further shock may completely unnerve  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Guy. We will spare him  every bit of trouble we possibly can. I will do all I can to help you, and we  will see it through. I suppose the&mdash;the police must be notified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t  thought of that. But, yes, I suppose it will be necessary. Let&rsquo;s wait a moment,  Sylvia. What happened? Why is Fairy dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again that wild, hunted look came  into Guy&rsquo;s eyes, and Sylvia shuddered at his expression.</p>
<p>She tried to be very calm, and  answered, gently: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We couldn&rsquo;t rouse her this morning, and as her  door was locked, Mr. Gerson broke in at the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&mdash;then, Sylvia, if she,&mdash;if  Fairy was in here alone,&mdash;it was,&mdash;it was,&mdash;I mean, she did it herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy,&rdquo; she said, quietly, but  positively, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make any surmises, don&rsquo;t express any opinions. Wait a  minute, who&rsquo;s the best doctor in the crowd over at the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor? Why, Greenfield, by all  odds. But he can&rsquo;t do any good. She&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t pronounce the dread word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But it&rsquo;s all right  to call a doctor, and much easier to have some one who is right here, than to  telephone to a Penrose man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Gerson, go over and get  word somehow to Doctor Greenfield, and tell him to come over here immediately.  Don&rsquo;t tell him why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Gerson departed, not minding  his errand so much now Master Guy was in charge.</p>
<p>Soon, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; called a cheery  voice, &ldquo;somebody eaten too much lobster and ice cream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor followed Gerson into  the cottage, and Guy met him just outside Fairy&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady on, Lew,&rdquo; Guy said.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s real trouble afoot, now. Come in, here&rsquo;s your patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy&rsquo;s voice was hard and metallic,  quite unlike his own full, hearty tones.</p>
<p>Greenfield entered, took in the  scared looking group at a glance, and then seeing the still figure on the bed,  knelt beside it.</p>
<p>In a moment he rose, and said :</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do nothing, Mackenzie. The  little girl is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; was Guy&rsquo;s quiet  reply, but he still spoke in that hard, strained voice. &ldquo;But tell us more. What  caused her death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to say, offhand. There seems  to have been no violence. There is no wound&mdash;that is, none visible. She could  not have met death with that calm effect, if she had been attacked by an  intruder. On the surface, indications point to poison. Unless, that is, she was  subject to heart trouble. Only an examination can prove the truth. Shall I  conduct one? Would it not be better to have your family physician?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy turned white to the lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You see,  our old family doctor knows nothing of Fairy, and I should far rather have your  services, if you are willing. It may mean your testimony later on, but I will  make good for your time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit that, boy. Of course I will  do as you ask, and anything further I can do to assist will be most willingly  attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick, Lew. Please stand  by, I need you,&mdash;need you terribly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto,&rdquo; and Greenfield threw off  his coat, and asked the way to the bathroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; Sylvia said, leading  him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one bathroom, but it is entirely at your disposal. Guy,&rdquo; she  turned to him, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better go over and tell your father about this,  and then, fix him up in some room over there. Don&rsquo;t let him come back here.  There&rsquo;ll be plenty of rooms, as so many are leaving this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo;  Greenfield said, overhearing them; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use in blinking the fact, that  unless I can prove positively and at once that this is a natural death, it will  mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police,&rdquo; said Guy calmly. &ldquo;I  know, Lew.&rdquo; The doctor went on with his occupation and Guy went slowly over to  the other house.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie was still at the  breakfast table, and his eyes looked a little sternly at his son, as the latter  entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;an accident has happened,&rdquo; he  said, to the company in general. &ldquo;If nobody minds, I&rsquo;ll tell my father about it  first, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you all. Come along, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two went into the small  library, and Guy closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; he said, briefly.</p>
<p>He had intended breaking the news  more slowly, more gently, but away from the eyes of strangers, he suddenly  realized what had happened and he blurted out the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who killed her?&rdquo; said the older  man.</p>
<p>Guy started. &ldquo;Why do you think she  was killed?&rdquo; he asked, harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said his father,  cryptically.</p>
<p>Guy stared at him. Was he off his  head?</p>
<p>But there was much to be done, and  it devolved on Guy to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just thought I&rsquo;d tell you  first, Dad,&rdquo; he said, more gently than he had spoken before, &ldquo;and now I must  tell the crowd. Shall I ring for Haskell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. If I want him, I&rsquo;ll ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, without further word, Guy  returned to the group still in the breakfast room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The festivities have culminated  in tragedy,&rdquo; he began, not meaning to sound stilted, but unable to talk  naturally. &ldquo;Aside from your great loss, Dorothy, and which I trust will be made  up to you, by the insurance people or by restoration of your pearls, another  and terrible loss is ours. Fairy Lovell, my fianc&eacute;e, died in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lovely girl! Why she looked  the picture of health! What sort of attack? What was the illness? Oh, Guy, I&rsquo;m  so sorry for you! My dear old man!&rdquo; and similar expressions of surprise and  sympathy were voiced by many.</p>
<p>It was Billy Trigg who sensed the  situation first. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you summoned Greenfield,&rdquo; he said, and Guy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had his report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then. I&rsquo;ll go over there  with you. Reed, you exert a little generalship over here. Give orders to the  servants when necessary, and you and Dorothy take charge of any matters that  turn up. We&rsquo;ll be back shortly. Don&rsquo;t let Guy&rsquo;s Dad be bothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping Guy&rsquo;s arm, Trigg led him  away and over to the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; he said,  briefly. Billy, when playing his role of funny man, was diffuse and of a slow,  drawling speech, but in earnest, was a different personality. Short of  language, brusque of manner, he rasped out questions and by compelling glances  he demanded the answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Guy said, slowly.  &ldquo;Wait till we hear what old Lew says about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went the rest of the way in  silence, for Billy Trigg always knew when to stop talking.</p>
<p>At the cottage, they found Sylvia  in her own room, and the doctor shut into Fairy&rsquo;s room, pursuing his unwelcome  task.</p>
<p>He was glad and willing to help  Guy Mackenzie in any way he could. They had been good chums at college, and  friends ever since.</p>
<p>But he did wish the opportunity  for helpfulness had been some matter less serious and less tragic.</p>
<p>However, there was no help for it,  so Lew Greenfield set himself to work with his usual method and precision.</p>
<p>And when at last, his mind was  made up, he came out to announce his conclusions.</p>
<p>As there was no sitting room in  that part of the house, Guy opened the door of the bedroom used by his father,  and they went in there.</p>
<p>It had not yet been done up, and  the bedclothing was thrown back over the footboard.</p>
<p>But it was a good-sized room, with  several chairs and a lounge in it, and the doctor ushered Guy, Trigg and Sylvia  inside, and shut the door in the face of the inquisitive and disappointed  Gersons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl was poisoned,&rdquo;  Greenfield said, without preliminary speech. &ldquo;There is every symptom of  arsenical poisoning and nothing else. There is positively no sign of violence,  no weapon, no wound as of shooting or stabbing, and yet, it is difficult to  think of that lovely happy little soul putting an end to her own life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy looked at the speaker, in a  mute appeal, but he said no word, and the doctor went on, unheeding him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no doubt about the  cause of death,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;for there is, I am sure, a trace of arsenic in  the glass on the bedside table that held milk. By the way, there&rsquo;s a glass just  like it on the night table in this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greenfield jumped up and looked  into the empty glass in question.</p>
<p>He tasted a drop that remained,  and said: &ldquo;Perfectly all right. Still, I advise that both glasses be carefully  put away for the detectives&rsquo; scrutiny. Such things are outside my province, but  it is always wise to pick up what evidence one can while the case is fresh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why a case?&rdquo; demanded Billy  Trigg, incisively. &ldquo;Seems to me, Lew, you&rsquo;re going pretty fast, with your  detectives and your cases! Are you already assuming a crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am assuming nothing,&rdquo;  Greenfield said, calmly, in no way ruffled at Trigg&rsquo;s attitude, &ldquo;But Guy asked  me to help him, and my experience has proved that when a death is even a little  bit mysterious, it is a good thing to catch on to any possibly indicative  facts. You needn&rsquo;t segregate those two glasses if you don&rsquo;t wish to, but I do  say that Miss Lovell either killed herself or was killed by somebody else,  intentionally. I can see no possibility of an accident, unless&mdash;well, as I say,  I&rsquo;m not a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Lew?&rdquo;  questioned Trigg. &ldquo;Is there a way out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, only a passing thought that  Miss Lovell might have put arsenic in the milk mistaking it for sugar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; exclaimed Sylvia, &ldquo;of  course, that&rsquo;s just what she did! Fairy loved sweet things,&mdash;she even put sugar  on her salad sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; conceded the doctor,  &ldquo;it may be. I can&rsquo;t quite see how anyone could have arsenic in sufficient  quantity to have it in a sugar receptacle, nor did I see any sign of a sugar  bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Sylvia said, slowly,  &ldquo;somebody might have put arsenic in her sugar bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the bowl, then?&rdquo;  Greenfield spoke with some asperity. &ldquo;But I insist, all that is not my affair.  I was asked to decide the cause of death. I did so, and I stake my medical  reputation on the correctness of my conclusions. Further than that I&rsquo;ve no  right or wish to probe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us go,&rdquo; Sylvia said,  rising. &ldquo;There is a hard day to be faced. What shall we do first,&mdash; regarding  Fairy, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; Billy Trigg said,  &ldquo;I am sure we must call the police. It is a wretched situation, but I tell you,  if Guy doesn&rsquo;t do it, he&rsquo;ll lay himself open to criticism. I know that&rsquo;s the  first duty of a citizen. Isn&rsquo;t it, Doc?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Greenfield, a little  shortly. &ldquo;Also, I should say, communicate with Miss Lovell&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, Guy&rsquo;s jaw dropped, and he  looked so startled that Trigg gave him a warning nudge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, old chap,&rdquo; he said,  with a kind note in his voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all back of you. We&rsquo;ll do all we can to  help and especially to take over the errands most distasteful to you. Can I go  over to New York &mdash;anything you want  done? But of course you don&rsquo;t know yet. Haven&rsquo;t had time to pull yourself  together. I know. Bad business all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see,&mdash;&rdquo; Guy spoke thickly, &ldquo;I  expected to call in the police this morning, regarding Dorothy&rsquo;s pearls. Both  Dad and I feel a certain responsibility in that matter, and we want to do all  we can. But now&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, they can take up the two  cases at once,&rdquo; Trigg suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go, too,&rdquo; Guy growled.  &ldquo;As Sylvia says, we don&rsquo;t know that poor little Fairy is a &lsquo;case&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the best way to find it out  is to summon the police people and ask their advice and opinion on it,&rdquo; Billy  said, crisply. &ldquo;Shall I do it, Guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the low-spoken but  distinct reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better do it from the big house,&rdquo;  Trigg said, looking about him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toddle over there. Don&rsquo;t come back there  till you choose to, Guy,&rdquo; and Trigg departed on his distasteful but necessary  duty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  The Police</b></h2>
<p>Guy, and Sylvia, left to  themselves a moment, went out on the verandah. The girl dropped into a small  chair there, and Guy sat on the railing.</p>
<p>Mechanically he lighted a  cigarette, and then, with a deep sigh, he turned to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to face the music,&rdquo; he  said, heavily, &ldquo;and while I don&rsquo;t know much about such matters, I think we have  to leave things untouched here, until the police can look them over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole house?&rdquo; asked Sylvia,  in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I daresay it  would be better to leave it all undisturbed until they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then I must tell Mrs.  Gerson, or she&rsquo;ll have everything, what she calls &lsquo;redd up&rsquo; in a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do. And, I say, Sylvia,&mdash;it  seems dreadful to think of those men prowling round in Fairy&rsquo;s room, and  digging into her things,&mdash;her letters and papers, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But, Guy, we daren&rsquo;t  touch those!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. But you go in,  Sylvia,&mdash;just go in and take a look round. Do, Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to look for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Just see if you  find anything that the police might call a&mdash;a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Guy,&rdquo; Sylvia was more and  more amazed, &ldquo;if anybody killed Fairy,&mdash;and you know that child never killed  herself!&mdash;surely you want to know who did it. And any clue&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I want to know  who did it,&rdquo; Guy muttered, with a queer, obstinate look on his face. &ldquo;Do,  Sylvie, go in and take a look round.&rdquo; Bewildered, and unwilling, Sylvia rose to  do his bidding.</p>
<p>She had all her life been  accustomed to obey Guy, but never before had he given her such a hard task. As  she rose, her little velvet bag slid to the floor. &ldquo;Shall I keep it for you?&rdquo;  he asked, as he picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, give it here. It has my  handkerchief in it&mdash;&rdquo; And then Sylvia was gone.</p>
<p>Doctor Greenfield was in Fairy&rsquo;s  room, and evidently glad to see Sylvia as she appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it, Doctor?&rdquo; she  whispered, &ldquo;who killed that dear child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lew Greenfield looked at her  oddly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too soon to say yet, Miss Field,&rdquo;  he returned. &ldquo;And a complicated matter at best. Such a lot of guests, such a  horde of servants, and so little care used in the way of locking up and all  that. Why the great gates are never even closed, and I doubt if half the rooms  have locks to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we never use the locks that  are there,&rdquo; Sylvia supplemented. &ldquo;There are no marauders or intruders around  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Long Island was the  happy hunting ground of such gentry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in this peaceful section. And  anyway, who would come in to molest poor little Fairy? She had almost no  valuables, she was friendly with all the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we know nothing as yet.  It&rsquo;s idle to speculate. Will you stay here a few moments, Miss Field, while I  step in another room, and jot down a brief report?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; and Sylvia sat quietly  until the door closed and then she jumped up and began the search Guy had asked  for.</p>
<p>But there was nothing mysterious  or sinister to be seen. The gown and shoes Jenny had taken off the night  before, were duly put away in Fairy&rsquo;s wardrobe and the gossamer-like silken  lingerie was tossed on a chair, as was the fluffy blue negligee.</p>
<p>The dresser, beyond the usual  array of brushes and toilet implements and perfumes showed also the diamond  pendant on its diamond chain, that Guy had given as a betrothal gift.</p>
<p>Sylvia winced to note how  carelessly it had been flung there, but she also realized that its presence did  away with all thought of robbery.</p>
<p>She went on to the writing table,  and in the blotting book she saw a half-written letter.</p>
<p>She read it, but it seemed  unimportant, anyway, she would let the police decide that. She had no intention  of concealing or removing any evidence, unless it was something flagrantly  against&mdash;well, against any of the Warlock household.</p>
<p>But on a sudden impulse, she  picked up Fairy&rsquo;s pen, dipped it in the ink, and made one tiny speck of a mark  on the letter in question.</p>
<p>Only an infinitesimal scratch,  straight, and less than the thirty-second part of an inch in length.</p>
<p>Then closing the blotting book,  and replacing the pen on its rack, Sylvia turned to look at the dead girl, who,  lovely as ever, showed no trace of the doctor&rsquo;s investigations.</p>
<p>A blue satin spread was drawn up  to her throat, but the arm stretched outside it remained as it had been and the  delicate sleeve of her night robe, fell back from the dimpled flesh, no longer  rosy, but of a waxen whiteness.</p>
<p>Even as Sylvia gazed down at her,  the door opened softly, and the police entered the room.</p>
<p>Billy Trigg was leading them, and  at a word from him, Sylvia started to leave the room.</p>
<p>But the Inspector detained her,  saying politely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please remain. You are Miss  Field? And you first discovered the body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Sylvia showed an icy  hauteur. &ldquo;You wish to question me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just at present,&rdquo; Inspector  Baird replied, suavely.</p>
<p>Indeed, suavity was his long suit,  and to Miss Field or to Jenny, her maid, he would have used the same tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I should like to  have you remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I stay?&rdquo; asked Billy Trigg,  feeling intuitively that the nearness of a friend would be a source of comfort  to the girl.</p>
<p>And it was, for at the Inspector&rsquo;s  nod of assent, a glance of gratitude was flashed to Trigg.</p>
<p>With the Inspector were a police  surgeon, named Norris, and a detective who rejoiced in the more or less  appropriate name of Hunter.</p>
<p>They were all of a business-like  and energetic demeanor, and Norris at once began to examine the victim of the  tragedy, while Hunter showed every indication of wanting to be about his  business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Hunter,&rdquo; Baird said to  him. &ldquo;Fine comb this house first, the scene of the crime. Then take the big  house next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police had already spoken to  Guy, who was over at the other house, but Ralph Mackenzie they had not met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me all about this  morning,&rdquo; the Inspector said to Sylvia, not unkindly, but with a decided air of  authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t see Miss Lovell  first,&rdquo; Sylvia informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t? Who did, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Gerson, whose cottage this  is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she? Call her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not a difficult matter,  for both Abbie and Ezra Gerson were in the hall, not far from the closed door,  which, when it was opened, nearly precipitated them into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Baird, a little dryly,  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the people we want. Come along in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came, but their air of  importance wilted a little at sight of the formidable looking trio who regarded  them with grave interest.</p>
<p>The Penrose police force had  technique of manner, whatever their skill might prove to be, and their glances,  already accusing, somewhat unnerved the redoubtable Gersons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Field,&rdquo; Baird took up,  &ldquo;you will detail the story of finding Miss Lovell&rsquo;s body, and Mr. and Mrs.  Gerson may interrupt if you are not quite accurate, otherwise they need not  speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Sylvia began the recital,  telling first, how she had tapped at Miss Lovell&rsquo;s bedroom door and, getting no  response, had knocked louder.</p>
<p>This, too, was unsuccessful, but  the noise had brought Mrs. Gerson to the scene, and Sylvia had told her the  situation.</p>
<p>Then, she related, Mrs. Gerson had  gone outside and tried to look in at the French window, but could not see in because  of the shirred sash curtains.</p>
<p>She then went to the side windows,  but could not see the bed from there.</p>
<p>These windows at the side were  open, but were too high for entrance, as the house was on a hillside and the  foundations sloped sharply downward.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Gerson heard the  excitement going on, and came to investigate.</p>
<p>Hearing the story, he broke in at  the French window, but insisted his wife should enter first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Inspector Baird,  &ldquo;were you afraid of what you might see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerson gave him a look of  unutterable contempt. &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; on earth I&rsquo;m afraid of,&rdquo; he said,  simply. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t want to alarm or annoy the young lady, if so be she was  all right. I&rsquo;d no real reason to suppose harm had come to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; and Baird beamed on  him. &ldquo;You take it up from here, Mrs. Gerson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I stepped inside,&rdquo; and Mrs.  Gerson joyfully accepted her share of the limelight at last, &ldquo;and I thought the  poor young lady was just asleep and I was going to give her a little shake  like, when Miss Sylvia she grabbed at me, and says: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t touch her! She&rsquo;s  dead!&rsquo; And so I didn&rsquo;t touch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know she was dead?&rdquo;  and Baird turned to Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Common sense,&rdquo; was the brief  response. &ldquo;She was white and still, and I could see no movement as of breathing.  Moreover, had she been alive our noisy entrance and conversation must surely  have roused her from sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have been  doped&mdash;drugged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have been,&rdquo; said  Sylvia, calmly, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t think of that. I felt convinced and I stayed the  woman&rsquo;s hand while I tried to realize it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; and Baird nodded at  Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I sent Gerson over to call  Mr. Guy Mackenzie and bid him come over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot;Almost immediately, yes.  He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind him, he will tell his  story later. Now, as I understand it, nobody could enter Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room,  after the door was locked on the inside, without some such forcible effort as  was used this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Sylvia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know of the locking  up process last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locking up the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I mean the locking of Miss  Lovell&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing definitely.&rdquo;  Sylvia talked slowly, as if picking her words. &ldquo;I left her about half past one  o&rsquo;clock. We had a short chat in her room here, and then, I went to my room, and  Jenny, my maid, came to look after Miss Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this maid? Was she here  this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I had sent her over to the  other house to get her breakfast. It was getting late, and I said I&rsquo;d help Miss  Lovell with her toilet myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And when you tried to  rouse her, it was with the intent of helping her to dress and go to breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; and Sylvia  looked at her questioner, haughtily.</p>
<p>Why, she wondered, was he so  meticulous in his method? So precise in his manner?</p>
<p>Billy Trigg sensed her nervousness  under her exterior effect of calm dignity, but every attempt he had made to  speak had been checked by Baird, and there seemed nothing for Billy to do, but  sit near Sylvia and give her a sympathetic glance now and then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the maid saw Miss Lovell last  night after you did?&rdquo; the Inspector resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she came from her to me,  saying Miss Lovell was not sleepy and would read for a while before retiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lovell was in the habit of  drinking milk at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she had a glass put on her  bedside table for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took it in last night, as  usual,&rdquo; Mrs. Gerson volunteered, bridling a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve looked into that, Hunter?&rdquo;  Baird inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. There&rsquo;s traces of  arsenic in the glass that held the milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s no doubt then,  how Miss Lovell&rsquo;s death came about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt at all. Doctor Norris  agrees in every way with the report of Doctor Greenfield, who made an  examination before we arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finger prints on the tumbler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only those of Miss Lovell,  herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. Smart work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may call it that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, it may be suicide, after  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia spoke suddenly,  involuntariily, but the Inspector picked her up at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too incredible! That child  had everything to live for. She was a beauty and a belle. She was engaged to a  man she loved and who loved her. Aside from their affection, he was the heir to  this great estate, and she would be mistress here. Why should she kill herself?  It&rsquo;s too absurd! Isn&rsquo;t it, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia forgot the police, forgot  the occasion, forgot everything in her amazement that a girl beloved of Guy  Mackenzie could by any possibility end her life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; and Trigg jumped  into the conversation. &ldquo;And beside, Miss Lovell was a peculiarly childlike and  innocent nature. She was fond of pleasure, fond of admiration, fond of  affection. And she had them all, in unlimited measure. No, she would never take  her own life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are sometimes reasons of  which the world knows nothing. There may have been a secret, a tragedy, in her  past life that threatened her happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia paled.</p>
<p>That letter she had seen in the  Blotting book! Would those terrible men get hold of it? Could she abstract it  even yet? Oh, why hadn&rsquo;t she taken it when she had the chance? Poor little  Fairy. Must her past life, whatever it was, be dragged out into the light?</p>
<p>Sylvia had often wondered if there  were anything to drag out.</p>
<p>But the Inspector was talking  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Gerson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did  you hear any noises in the night? Any unusual noises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener thought deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard question to answer,  sir,&rdquo; he said, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you see it&rsquo;s this way.  Bein&rsquo; so much comp&rsquo;ny over to the big house, and the guest house bein&rsquo; also  chock-a-block, some few of the fambly is quartered over here, in this cottage  of mine. We ain&rsquo;t noways put out, my wife and me, &rsquo;cause we have a fairly good  room in the attic. And even if we was uncomfortable with it all, we&rsquo;d gladly do  anything to help Mr. Guy out with his big house party. So, they plans it that  Mr. Mackenzie and Miss Sylvia and Miss Lovell should camp out like in this  house. And campin&rsquo; it is, for them, bein&rsquo; used to all sorts of luxuries and  things. Howsumever, it seemed to Mr. Guy the best plan, &rsquo;cause he and his cronies  was kickin&rsquo; up bobberies all night in the big house, and it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no place for  the young ladies, nor yet for Mr. Mackenzie hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of bobberies did the  young men kick up?&rdquo; Blair&rsquo;s tone and face were casual, as if asking an  unimportant question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lordy, nothin&rsquo; bad, you know.  In fact, bobbery was no sort of word for me to use. All was, sometimes they  stayed up purty late, and smoked and swapped stories and if they felt like it,  they got out their college violins and cornets and things and they fair made a  racket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you hear them over here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the wind was this way. Not  else. But laws me! It wasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to speak of at most. Jest college didoes.  But, anyway, that&rsquo;s how the young ladies and Mr. Mackenzie came to be over  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were about to tell me  what you heard in the night. I mean in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I understand. And  that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s troublin&rsquo; me to explain. You see, me and my wife bein&rsquo; up in the  attic,&mdash;this is a bungalow house, but it&rsquo;s got a loft like, all in one room, and  that&rsquo;s our bedroom, for the time bein&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&mdash;go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, as you asked me did I hear  any unusual sounds, all I can say is all the sounds we hear now at night are  unusual. It ain&rsquo;t usual, of course, to hear Mr. Mackenzie a stompin&rsquo; in. And  the young ladies comin&rsquo; in, gigglin&rsquo; like as not. And that squeaky-voiced Jenny  traipsin&rsquo; about, clickin&rsquo; her high-heeled shoes, and runnin&rsquo; baths for the  ladies at all hours, and of course, guests from the big house poppin&rsquo; in and  out,&mdash;no, sir, them ain&rsquo;t usual noises in the Gersons&rsquo; place, them ain&rsquo;t! But,  also, we don&rsquo;t mind. We&rsquo;d put up with a lot more&rsquo;n that to &rsquo;commodate Mr. Guy.  Wouldn&rsquo;t we, Abbie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You jest bet we would,&rdquo; his  spouse replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get your meaning,&rdquo; Blair said,  thoughtfully. &ldquo;Now, perhaps I didn&rsquo;t quite make my own intent clear. What I  want to know is, did you hear any noises last night, that could not be  attributed to the cause you have just told over? Any noises that seemed to you  mysterious or suspicious? That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that again, is hard to  answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerson looked as if the weight of  the nation had descended on his shoulders. He scratched his head, he looked  pleadingly at his wife, he began to speak once or twice and then stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with it,&rdquo; Blair egged him on.  &ldquo;What was it you heard? You&rsquo;ve shown there was something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it was probably  nothin&rsquo; of importance. It jest seemed to me like I heard people around and  voices, kinder late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that, I dunno. I ain&rsquo;t got a  watch&mdash;leastwise, it ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;&mdash;and our clock is down in Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s room.  It&rsquo;s a fairly hefty one, and we didn&rsquo;t move it upstairs bein&rsquo; as it was jest  for two or three nights. So I don&rsquo;t know the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you know it was  late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because the house was still,  like everybody in it was abed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you heard voices. Do you  suppose they were voices of those belonging in the house, or intruders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what bothered me, sir. It  couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been the folks downstairs talkin&rsquo; to each other. And if it had been  intruders,&mdash;that is, burgulars or such, they wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; talked to each other  so&rsquo;s I could hear &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the only theory is that  there were one or more visitors of some sort and that he or they talked to some  of the people already in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that would sorta explain  it, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would, and that&rsquo;s what  happened,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Gerson, unable to keep quiet another minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard the voices, then?&rdquo;  asked Baird.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Course I did. And I heard &rsquo;em  plain. And not only voices but other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as footsteps and openin&rsquo;  doors, and openin&rsquo; winders and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Mrs. Gerson, please give a  full account of anything you heard after you retired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing I done downstairs  was to take Miss Fairy&rsquo;s glass of milk to her. I loved to do that, for she  thanked me so sweet and pretty, her lookin&rsquo; like an angel, with her blue eyes  and her pure gold hair. She said good night and I said good night and I clumb  right upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had already taken Mr.  Mackenzie&rsquo;s glass of milk to his room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I took that some time  before. But I put off takin&rsquo; Miss Fairy&rsquo;s till I was sure she was in, so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d  ketch a glimpse of her sweet face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on about the rest of the  night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Ezra says, it&rsquo;s kinda hard to  tell, for not havin&rsquo; our clock we&rsquo;re so used to havin&rsquo;, I couldn&rsquo;t never know  what time it was. But I heard the young ladies a hob-nobbin&rsquo; and Jenny scootin&rsquo;  around and waitin&rsquo; on &rsquo;em, and then all was still. And then, it musta been  &rsquo;long &rsquo;bout one o&rsquo;clock, I heard somebody at Miss Fairy&rsquo;s window. But in a  minute I reckernized it was Mr. Guy, and so I turned over to go to sleep  thinkin&rsquo; no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Mr. Guy in the habit of  calling on Miss Lovell so late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t calling, jest dropped  over, like, to tell her somethin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d forgot or such. Laws, those two turkle  doves see enough of each other by day not to go serenadin&rsquo; like by night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerson&rsquo;s fine scorn of a hint  of anything clandestine was a tacit reproof to the Inspector, and he said, only:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, soon after, seems  like I heard somebody else come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also to Miss Lovell&rsquo;s window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what it seemed like,  but I guess it was Mr. Guy goin&rsquo; away again. You know how you drop asleep for  ten seconds and you wake sudden, thinkin&rsquo; you been off for an hour! Well, after  that, I heard somebody walkin&rsquo; softly across the hall. That seemed mighty  funny, for why would anybody be rampoosin&rsquo; round this house in the night? But  after that, I heard feetsteps again, and I got up and peeked over the banister.  And, if you please, it was Miss Fairy, lookin&rsquo; too sweet for anything! She was  in her little blue kimonia, and her toes in her little slippers, and her arms  full of bath towels and things, and she was heading for the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t she disturb the other  sleepers, running the water at that hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, Miss ,Fairy, she  wasn&rsquo;t never one to think about such things, sir. If she wanted a bath, then a  bath she must have, if it disturbed all the king&rsquo;s horses and all the king&rsquo;s men.  And such was the respeck and devotion she was held in that nobody never minded  nor complained. That they didn&rsquo;t! Miss Fairy&rsquo;s word was law, here, and I guess  every place she&rsquo;s ever inhabited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw her come back from her  bath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir. I hung over the banister  jest for the joy of seein&rsquo; her trip back to her room. And I saw her, a smilin&rsquo;  as she went along barefoot, her slippers in her hand. Bless her sweet face,  that was the last I ever saw her,&mdash;alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Letter</b></h2>
<p>Baird was not deeply impressed  with the importance of the Gersons&rsquo; testimony, though it did give him an idea  of the general situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Field,&rdquo; he said, turning to  Sylvia, &ldquo;did you hear these noises in the night? I mean as of people coming and  going, such as Mr. and Mrs. Gerson have mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Mr. Guy Mackenzie come to  Miss Lovell&rsquo;s window and speak to her a few moments there. I don&rsquo;t think he  came inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two o&rsquo;clock, or a little  before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you hear their  conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you hear any of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baird&rsquo;s tone was a bit more severe  now, and Sylvia answered, directly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I paid no attention to it, but I  couldn&rsquo;t help gathering enough to let me know that Mr. Mackenzie had come over  to say a last good night to his fianc&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The interview was not a quarrel,  then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia could not restrain a sad  little smile, but she said: &ldquo;On the contrary, it was of an affectionate  nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; spoke up Billy Trigg,  impetuously, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to pin any crime on Guy Mackenzie. He was so infatuated  with his little lady, he would have suffered torture himself rather than harm a  hair of her head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, no doubt,&rdquo; Baird  returned; &ldquo;but we have to make inquiries, you know. Found anything, Hunter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; and the detective  came back into the room, after a search through the other rooms. &ldquo;I found this  in Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s dresser drawer under a pile of shirts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Baird, taking  the small packet Hunter gave him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to be white  arsenic. Powdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White arsenic! Good Lord! Where&rsquo;s  Norris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s gone, but we&rsquo;ll just  lay it aside, as is, for the coroner to see.&rdquo; Hunter was of a nonchalant sort,  and he tucked the parcel in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what&rsquo;s that white  powder scattered on the bedside table?&rdquo; Baird said, suddenly. &ldquo;Looks like the  same thing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunter scrutinized the fine white  powder that was visible here and there on the books and toilet implements that  were on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno what this is,&rdquo; he said, as  he tasted it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Sylvia said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the  dust that comes with marshmallows. Not sugar, you know. It&rsquo;s  tasteless,&mdash;cornstarch, or something like that. And I&rsquo;ve no doubt your arsenic  is something equally harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Sylvia was usually quiet  and composed, the manner of the Inspector&rsquo;s, suave as it was had roused her to  irritability, and she spoke with an exasperated air, as if the conclusions of  the police were utter nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so harmless, since it killed  Miss Lovell,&rdquo; Hunter said. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re right about this marshmallow business,  Miss Field. This white powder on the little bedside table is the fine white  dust that always coats that candy. And here is the container.&rdquo; From the waste  basket he drew a small tin box, labeled marshmallows and empty save for the  lining paper and some traces of the cornstarch dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sylvia cried, eagerly,  &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it. Miss Lovell ate them continually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Hunter returned, &ldquo;but  that fact has nothing to do with the fact that a packet of arsenic was found  among Mr. Ralph Mackenzie&rsquo;s belongings, and that Miss Lovell met her death from  arsenical poisoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be that the arsenic that  killed her was mixed in with the marshmallow dust?&rdquo; said Baird, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; Hunter replied, &ldquo;but  I&rsquo;ll keep the candy box and have it carefully examined. And, too, we&rsquo;ve proved  the poison was in the milk. Now, somebody put it there, and put it there  purposely. Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the master of the  house,&rdquo; Baird said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Sylvia broke  out, impulsively. &ldquo;That packet of arsenic, if it is arsenic, is a plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean by that?&rdquo;  asked Baird, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that whoever poisoned Miss  Lovell&rsquo;s glass of milk, left false evidence around the house to incriminate  other people. You say you found arsenic in Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s room. Well, here is  what I found in my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her bag and produced a  small packet which she handed to the Inspector.</p>
<p>Taking it from Baird, Hunter  opened it carefully and declared it was white oxide of arsenic, and that the  parcel was almost identical with the one he had in his possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo; Baird asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my top dresser drawer, under a  pile of handkerchiefs. I took it out this morning, wondering what it could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why are you carrying it  around with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had just come across it, as I  was getting a handkerchief, when I realized it was time to waken Miss Lovell. I  left the parcel on top of my bureau and ran to knock at her door. A few moments  later, when we found we could not rouse her, I thought I&rsquo;d better secure the  parcel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Did you know it to be  poison?&rdquo; Baird flung at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not. But it was a  mysterious thing to find in such an unexpected place, and I thought it wiser to  have it in my own possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick thinking!&rdquo; said Baird, a  little ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not thinking at all,&rdquo; Sylvia  retorted. &ldquo;I was alarmed about Miss Lovell&rsquo;s silence, and I had the little  parcel on my mind, so I involuntarily ran back and secured it, until I could  investigate and see what it could be. Now, I see that the one who poisoned Miss  Lovell&rsquo;s glass of milk put a false clue in my room and in Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s room,  to make it seem the work of either or both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunter looked at her with  admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Field,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s  smart work on your, part. And if it&rsquo;s true, we have to look for a clever  criminal. Now, tell me a little about Miss Lovell herself and then we&rsquo;ll go  over to the other house. Where are her people? Where is her home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know little of those matters,&rdquo;  Sylvia said, her hauteur returning. &ldquo;I never saw her until she came here  Saturday morning. She lived in New York City, but I don&rsquo;t know the address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get that from Guy  Mackenzie. Tell us more of her nature, her character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I knew her at all, I  knew only good of her,&rdquo; Sylvia assured them. &ldquo;She was amiable, sweet-tempered  and friendly with everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had she enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t explain this  letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunter showed her the letter he  had taken from the blotting book.</p>
<p>Sylvia took it and read it as if  she had never seen it before.</p>
<p>It was dated Monday, 7:30 a.m.</p>
<p>And it ran:</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dear  Old Boy,<br>
Your threats do not frighten me in the least. I snap my fingers at you and you  can do your worst. The snowdrops are healed and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently the writer had been  interrupted, for the words ceased abruptly, and with a slight blur of ink, as  if the hand had paused in startled surprise.</p>
<p>It was the letter Sylvia had seen  in the writing book, but it conveyed no information to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea what  those words mean or to whom they were written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know it to be Miss  Lovell&rsquo;s writing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia hesitated. She had no wish  to be other than frank and candid, but the situation was so appalling and the  outcome so precarious, she did not want to take any definite part in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must be,&rdquo; she admitted  at last. &ldquo;I am not familiar with Miss Lovell&rsquo;s penmanship, but I have seen some  of it. And, too, it is not likely another would have written at her desk, or in  her blotting book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know this was in her  blotting book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it there this morning  before you came,&rdquo; Sylvia said, but her cheek paled and then flushed, as she  remembered how she had been tempted to remove the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is dated seven-thirty this  morning,&rdquo; Hunter went on. &ldquo;Yet the doctors agree that Miss Lovell died about  three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia sat silent, looking at him  with a slightly inquiring glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t explain this  discrepancy, Miss Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly cannot. The doctors  may be mistaken, or the letter may be a forgery. I&rsquo;m sure I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed wearily, and Billy  Trigg, who had been mostly a silent, but deeply interested listener, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Miss Field has told you  all she knows of the matter. May I suggest you carry it over to the other  house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suggestion greatly annoyed  Baird, for the simple reason that he wanted to do that very thing.</p>
<p>So he turned rather sternly to  Trigg and asked him if he knew anything more of Miss Lovell personally than had  yet been divulged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; he returned,  cheerfully. &ldquo;Never saw her till Saturday, and like all the rest of us, fell in  love at first sight. She is&mdash;was, a charmer in every way. A dear, sweet,  innocent girl, and whoever killed her, it was no one connected with this  household or in the house party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be learned,&rdquo; and Baird  rose slowly. &ldquo;Also, the motive is to be learned. You can&rsquo;t find a murderer till  you&rsquo;ve found a motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; agreed Trigg,  who knew next to nothing of crime lore. &ldquo;But you have the fact of the murder,  the method used, and the identity of the victim, can&rsquo;t you go on from there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t the identity of the  victim,&rdquo; Baird denied. &ldquo;You call her Fairy Lovell, but nobody seems to know her  home, her antecedents or her history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy Mackenzie knows all that,&rdquo;  Sylvia informed him. &ldquo;He will tell you all you want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Baird said, gruffly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going over there. Lock Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; he directed a  subordinate. &ldquo;Put a guard on it, and let no one enter this house, till I come  back. Tell the Gersons to stay in their own quarters and don&rsquo;t allow them in  this end of the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the grim quartette marched  across the lawns to Warlock House.</p>
<p>Both Baird and Hunter took on a  more official manner. It had been hard to play the inquisitor with a sensitive,  frightened girl like Sylvia, but with a crowd of people, most of them men, it  would be easier.</p>
<p>The whole party was grouped in the  great hall, and Guy sat among them, awaiting the ordeal.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie was there, too,  his fine, strong face hard and set looking but his courteous dignity quite  unimpaired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is necessary first of all,&rdquo;  Baird said, &ldquo;to establish the identity of the victim of this crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia, who had taken a seat next  the elder Mackenzie, heard him catch his breath quickly, and glancing at Guy,  saw his face grow paler and his hands clench tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me, Mr. Mackenzie,&rdquo;  he looked at Guy, &ldquo;where you first met the lady to whom you later became  engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first met her at a studio tea,  at the home of an artist friend in New York City.&rdquo; Guy fairly bit off his  words, as if unwilling to give any further information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then the acquaintance  developed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went to see her at her home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a number of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is her home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy gave the number, in a street  among the East fifties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lived there with whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lovell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It is a rooming house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Now, you have communicated  with Mrs. Lovell as to her daughter&rsquo;s sudden death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to get her on the  telephone a short time ago, but she was not in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, we can doubtless get her  later. As to Miss Lovell&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; Guy murmured in a  low voice. &ldquo;He died many years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Miss Lovell and her mother  were alone in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a great blow to the  mother. How long ago did you first meet Miss Lovell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy hesitated so long that Baird  was obliged to repeat his question.</p>
<p>Then Guy sat up straighter. He  gave himself a sort of shake, as if asserting his independence and answered,  clearly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Miss Lovell for the first  time about three weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known her less than a  month then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was a case of love at  first sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very deep love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very deep, intense and tender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy&rsquo;s voice vibrated with feeling,  and Baird silently eliminated him from his present list of suspects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you,&mdash;think carefully, Mr.  Mackenzie,&mdash; have you any suspicion of anyone who might have killed the young  lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy&rsquo;s eyes blazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had,&rdquo; he almost shouted, &ldquo;do  you suppose I&rsquo;d be sitting here like this? I&rsquo;d be after him, choking the breath  out of his body!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, don&rsquo;t talk that way. We  know you must feel revengeful, but you can gain your ends better by sitting  quietly and helping our investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want an investigation,&rdquo;  Guy declared. &ldquo;The girl is dead, no investigation can restore her to me. I wish  you&rsquo;d let the matter drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that, sir. Now, tell  us more. Do you know of any enemy Miss Lovell had, or could have had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not. She could have had  none. She was too gentle, too adorable, too angelic in every way, to imagine an  enemy. The thing must have been an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was no accident. Miss  Lovell was murdered, by a clever and determined criminal. It is our duty to  discover who he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; Guy spoke  belligerently, &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try,&rdquo; Baird said, coldly.  &ldquo;And first, we want to know more about the lady. Perhaps Mr. Guy Mackenzie is  prejudiced in her favor. Mr. Ralph Mackenzie, can you throw any further light  on the past of your daughter-in-law to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Ralph Mackenzie looked  compassionately at his son. &ldquo;No, I never saw her until last Saturday morning.  She was very beautiful, very charming and very sweet. I know nothing more about  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you did not approve the  marriage.&rdquo; Mackenzie smiled slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many an old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;finds  it hard to believe any woman good enough for his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you had no objection to  Miss Lovell, except that she would take your son away from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; And Ralph Mackenzie  rose and left the room, as if the subject was ended for him.</p>
<p>Baird did not detain him. It was  clear the old man knew nothing more, and would not tell it if he did.</p>
<p>The Inspector turned to the  assembly of guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you are  all anxious to go home,&mdash;I understand you are leaving this morning. To expedite  matters, I will examine you all at once, or as near that as possible. Is there  anyone here who can give me any further details of Miss Lovell, or her people  or her past life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one responded, and all looked  at the questioner with respectful interest but with no gleam of hidden  knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does any one of you know the  lady&rsquo;s first name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy,&rdquo; was pronounced by two or  three voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assume that to be a nickname.  What is her baptismal name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke, until Guy said  slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard any other name for  her. I think Fairy is her given name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Now, it seems to me  imperative that we get in touch with her mother. Mr. Mackenzie, please give Mr.  Hunter the number, and he will go to the telephone and inform Mrs. Lovell of  the tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy looked exceedingly unwilling,  and even offered to go himself to the telephone, but Inspector Baird said,  decidedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Hunter the call,&rdquo; and so  peremptory was his voice, that Guy obeyed.</p>
<p>The detective left the room, and  Baird took up his querying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anyone here present go over  to the cottage where Miss Lovell had her room, after midnight last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again a silence, though two or  three men fidgeted a little in their seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Guy said, again showing  that fearless independence of spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went over to say good night to  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tapped at her window. She  opened the casement, we said good night and I returned back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time did you go over to  the gardener&rsquo;s cottage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think between half past one and  two. I can&rsquo;t say more exactly than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anyone who can corroborate  this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At least twenty of the men present  were ready to swear that Guy did leave them, and did return to them between the  hours of half past one and two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More like quarter of two, he went  away,&rdquo; declared Mullins. &ldquo;I notice such things and I&rsquo;ll say he went about  twenty to two, and was back by five minutes after the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a close observer,&rdquo; said  Baird, staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detective instinct,&rdquo; Mullins  returned, without a smile. &ldquo;I write detective stories for a living, and I get  the habit of close observation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, it would seem,&rdquo; Baird said,  slowly, &ldquo;that so far as we know, Mr. Guy Mackenzie was the last one to see Miss  Lovell alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except the murderer,&rdquo; Mullins  said, with a shake of his head. &ldquo;It always seems queer to me why investigators,  learning of one who saw the victim shortly before the crime was committed,  pounce upon the idea that he was the last one to see the victim alive. Now, at  what time is Miss Lovell judged to have died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is uncertain,&rdquo; Baird said, a  little more respect in his tone, for he knew of Mullins the writer. &ldquo;It had  been supposed that the hour was between three and four. But a letter in Miss  Lovell&rsquo;s blotting book, is dated seven-thirty this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Guy. &ldquo;Where is  that letter? Whom is it to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to you, sir,&rdquo; and Baird  smiled a little. &ldquo;Here it is, if you care to read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed Guy the letter, which  might mean something or nothing.</p>
<p>Guy chose to assume the latter,  and he returned it saying, &ldquo;I can give you no light on that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Miss Lovell&rsquo;s handwriting,  is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like  it,&mdash;exactly like it. But I am no penmanship expert, and it may be a forgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would anyone forge such a  note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. I can&rsquo;t understand  any part of this dreadful situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy passed his hand across his  forehead, as if in a stunned weariness.</p>
<p>Turning from him, Baird put the  various house guests through a quick, sharp series of questions.</p>
<p>He must have ferreted out through  some of his subordinates the story of Fairy&rsquo;s wild dance, also the fact that  she was far from being <i>persona grata</i> to the elder Mackenzie.</p>
<p>All the guests did their best to  put a good face on the matter, to set Fairy forth in the best possible light  and to stand by Guy to the limit.</p>
<p>But Baird was canny, too, and he  gave them to understand that any dereliction from the truth, or any  misrepresentation of facts would work harm to all concerned.</p>
<p>The result was that he gained a  fairly accurate account of Fairy&rsquo;s behavior from the time she came to Warlock  House until she said good night to them all the night before.</p>
<p>Guy writhed in secret as some of  their statements were made, but he showed no sign of his inner disturbance and  held up his head bravely, to meet whatever might further be in store for him.</p>
<p>Hunter returned from making his  telephone call.</p>
<p>Guy, then, was not the only one  who sat alert, agog with curiosity to hear of the mother of the beautiful girl.</p>
<p>Sylvia, too, wanted to know of  Mrs. Lovell, but she shivered with apprehension, for she had been anxious all  along as to Fairy&rsquo;s progenitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got the number, Hunter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you succeed in speaking to  Mrs. Lovell herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Mrs. Lovell left the  boarding house yesterday. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not known. She took all her  belongings and left no address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Landlady</b></h2>
<p>Of all the surprised looking faces  at this news, none was more utterly blank than Guy&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You must  have had the wrong number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Hunter told him, &ldquo;I had the  right call. Mrs. Craig the landlady, talked to me herself. She has no idea  where Mrs. Lovell went from her house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be found,&rdquo; Baird said.  &ldquo;Can you, Mr. Mackenzie, suggest any way of reaching her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;I am all at sea.  I supposed that was their permanent place of abode. Where can she have gone?  And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be found,&rdquo; Baird  repeated. &ldquo;Will you describe her, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a quiet, rather plain  little person,&rdquo; Guy said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;the sort that is hard to describe. She  was not ill-looking, but had no claims to such beauty as her daughter  possessed. She was delicate and so did not come to this house party, lest she  contract a cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that helps us much,&rdquo;  Baird told him. &ldquo;Surely you can give some more definite information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Guy said, shortly.</p>
<p>He was deeply annoyed at this  exposure of his very scant knowledge of Fairy&rsquo;s mother and he could not fail to  note the looks of surprise on all present.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie studied his son&rsquo;s  face in a stern silence.</p>
<p>Then Mullins spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see, Mr. Baird,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;why the abscene from home of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s mother should halt your  investigation of the mystery of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s death. The mother can scarcely be  a suspect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking from the  standpoint of your own fiction work, Mr. Mullins,&rdquo; Baird informed him. &ldquo;An  investigation in real life is a different matter. It is of the utmost  importance to trace the facts of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s home and family. Or family  connections. How else can we look for a motive or for clues? Unless Mr.  Mackenzie can give us some definite information, I must put professional  investigators on the track of the girl. Do you know nothing of her life, sir,  more than you have told us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Guy answered, frankly. &ldquo;As I  told you it was a case of love at first sight, on both sides. I found Miss  Lovell a dear sweet girl, and her mother a refined gentlewoman. I asked no  more, feeling sure that any needed information would be forthcoming at the time  of our wedding. This may seem an unusual state of things, but those are the  facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy looked so handsome and so  straightforward, that Sylvia gazed at him, her heart full of admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, Mr. Mackenzie, that  if you were to go to New York you could find out anything more about Miss  Lovell,&mdash;or Mrs. Lovell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was put in such a  strange voice and with such an odd expression on Baird&rsquo;s face, that everyone sensed a hidden meaning.</p>
<p>Guy turned a little paler, but he  said, with the same air of frankness he had shown:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say. If you wish I will  go to the house where I know they lived and try to learn from Mrs. Craig more  than she told over the telephone. It may be I could learn more than your  professionals could. I shall be glad to get any information I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go ahead,&rdquo; Baird instructed  him. &ldquo;I must, of course, send one of my men with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Guy, &ldquo;so long as  it isn&rsquo;t a reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it will be a police  detective. In plain clothes, of course. Name of Parsons. Will you start at  once, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer way to conduct an  investigation,&rdquo; Mullins said to himself, but aloud he said: &ldquo;May I go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Mullins,&rdquo; and Baird  smiled at him, &ldquo;I want your help here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The said Parsons materialized as  if by magic, and in a short time, he and Guy Mackenzie set off on their strange  errand.</p>
<p>There was little said on the way,  for Guy, driving his fast roadster was engrossed with the wheel, and too, he  had no wish to discuss matters with Parsons.</p>
<p>The detective was courteous and  deferential, but Guy clearly understood he was a guardian as well as a sleuth.</p>
<p>In less than two hours they  reached the house in the East fifties.</p>
<p>Locking his car, Guy led the way  and they were promptly admitted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig appeared and recognized  Guy at once. &ldquo;What seems to be the matter?&rdquo; she said, breezily. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a  strange man telephoning this morning for Mrs. Lovell&rsquo;s address, and here you  are after the same thing, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Craig, that&rsquo;s what  we&rsquo;re after,&rdquo; Guy returned, speaking so soberly, that Mrs. Craig looked at him  more closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know it, any more  than I did early this morning. How could I find it out? When people pick up  everything and clear out with no given address, it generally means they don&rsquo;t  want their whereabouts known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parsons took up the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that, Mrs. Craig? Do  you think Mrs. Lovell doesn&rsquo;t want her address known? Why doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good land, I don&rsquo;t know! How do  you suppose I know the secrets of my boarders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think there are  secrets? Have you any reason to think Mrs. Lovell had anything to conceal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I had, why should I tell  you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are grave reasons. Miss  Lovell,&mdash;Miss Fairy Lovell is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Dead? I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true. Now, as you can  readily see, we want to get in touch with her mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if it&rsquo;s like that, I  s&rsquo;pose I ought to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly ought to tell us  anything you know of the Lovells, mother or daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. Mrs. Lovell isn&rsquo;t  that girl&rsquo;s mother at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t! What do you mean?&rdquo;  cried Guy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say. Mrs. Lovell, as  we called her, was a hired mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; Guy begged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, Mr. Mackenzie,&rdquo; and  Mrs. Craig looked at him, pityingly. &ldquo;The Lovell girl roped you in, and to do  it, she had to set up a mother. Don&rsquo;t take it so hard, sir. All those girls  hire mothers, when they need &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All what girls?&rdquo; Parsons spoke  sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why all the girls who are on  their own. Chorus girls, dancers, movie actresses and models.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which was Miss Lovell?&rdquo; Parsons&rsquo;  voice was inexorable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she was a dancer, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A professional dancer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. You knew that, didn&rsquo;t  you, Mr. Mackenzie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Guy stared blankly at  her. &ldquo;No, of course I didn&rsquo;t know that, and I don&rsquo;t believe if now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may as well believe it  for it&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us more about it,&rdquo; Parsons  ordered, &ldquo;Where did she dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At different places,&mdash;night clubs,  cabarets, restaurants,&mdash;wherever she could get a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely she had no difficulty in  getting positions,&rdquo; Parsons said, &ldquo;with her beauty and grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in getting them, but in keeping  them,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig&rsquo;s smile was significant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Guy, so  stormily that Parsons checked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not ask too many  questions, Mr. Mackenzie. Go on, Mrs. Craig. What name did she use as a dancer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goldie Glenn. You&rsquo;ve heard of  her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Parsons shook  his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor anybody else!&rdquo; Guy declared.  &ldquo;None of this is true. Mrs. Craig has Fairy mixed up with some one else. My  little girl never was a public dancer! Ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as he spoke his mind  raced back to the night she danced at Warlock House. Surely that was the work  of an experienced artiste. Oh, he knew it was all true, his brain told him  that, but his heart refused to believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lovely little Fairy! So dainty, so  angelic,&mdash;a dancer!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And her mother?&rdquo; he asked,  heavily. &ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a professional mother.  When the girls need her she acts any line they want. In this case she was a  middle-aged, delicate lady, somewhat of an invalid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy groaned. Not only because he  had been played for a fool, but because he couldn&rsquo;t bear to think all this of  lovely Fairy or of her attractive gentle seeming &ldquo;mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Mrs. Lovell, as we will  call her, leave so suddenly?&rdquo; Parsons inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think she just  got tired of the job. She was here a little over three weeks, and she wasn&rsquo;t  any too happy about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too slow for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that. If she hadn&rsquo;t been  getting a good price, she&rsquo;d have ducked sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we have to hunt  her up. What&rsquo;s her real name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, none of that. You  do know. And, too, Mrs. Crag, you want to watch your step, for this death of  Miss Lovell&rsquo;s,&mdash;or whatever her name is,&mdash;is a bit mysterious, and you don&rsquo;t want  to be mixed up in a murder case, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, what&rsquo;ll you tell me next? Fairy murdered? Pretty, sweet  little Fairy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily Guy gave her a  glance of gratitude for the impulsive burst of sympathy.</p>
<p>But Parsons showed no emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;somebody poisoned  her. Now, you tell all you know,&mdash;everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know an earthly thing  that will shed any light on that. Why, everybody loved the girl, bad as she  was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Guy&rsquo;s eyes blazed.  &ldquo;Whatever she was, nobody says a word against her in my presence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So go on, Mrs. Craig. What is the  mother&rsquo;s name, and where can we find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to find her,&rdquo; Guy  said, shocked and amazed at the whole sordid story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Parsons declared. &ldquo;Name  and address, Mrs. Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name, Lora Grant,&rdquo; she said,  slowly. &ldquo;But I really have no idea where she is. Do you suppose she knew of  this&mdash;this thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see how she could,&rdquo; Parsons  told hen &ldquo;It was only discovered this morning. How could she know of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, how could she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Parsons caught the look on the  woman&rsquo;s face, and he quickly read her thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, unless somebody did it  who was known to the mother person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t mean anything.  Who did kill her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. We have no clue;  at least, they didn&rsquo;t have when we left the house. Now, if you don&rsquo;t know Lora  Grant&rsquo;s address, tell me some way to find her. You can do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I can, and I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll  have to. Well, you can learn it from the Riffraff Club. They&rsquo;ll have to tell  you, as it&rsquo;s such a serious matter. But of course Lora Grant had nothing to do  with the &mdash;the killing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no reason to think so. What  about her alibi? Was she here all day Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she left Sunday morning,  about eleven or so. She was all packed up and just called a taxi and went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she take Fairy&rsquo;s things with  her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy had all her best things with  her, where she went. Miss Grant took a few things Fairy left; but the rubbish  she left behind, it&rsquo;s up there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;d better give it the once  over. Might be some clues. Come along, Mr. Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And much as Guy hated it, he had  to trail upstairs with Parsons and sit by while the detective ran over the  remains of Fairy&rsquo;s wardrobe.</p>
<p>It sickened Guy. The little frocks  all soiled and torn, the hodgepodge of lingeries, cosmetics, toilet articles,  all in bad condition, but all telling of a tawdry, untidy nature.</p>
<p>He turned aside until Parsons had  finished. &ldquo;Nothing here,&rdquo; the detective declared. &ldquo;We want a different sort of  clues from these. Come on, Mr. Mackenzie: I&rsquo;ll put trackers on the Grant woman  but I&rsquo;m responsible for your safe return, and I think we&rsquo;ll return now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy said nothing, and going out to  the car, they were soon speeding along toward home.</p>
<p>Guy thought deeply as he bent over  his wheel.</p>
<p>Not a word did he say to Parsons,  he forgot the man&rsquo;s existence. He was alone with his grief. His poor, broken  heart couldn&rsquo;t rise above the awful shock it had received in learning that  Fairy had deceived him.</p>
<p>Yet, had she? He had never asked  her concerning her family, save a few merely casual questions the first night  they met. Why hadn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s what was stinging him.  He knew, now, that he had refrained because he feared what she might say.  Feared that her ancestry and her upbringing had not been what would please his  father. He had not apprehended anything like the truth, as he now knew it, but he  had dreaded to put questions which might have uncomfortable answers. He had  hoped, blindly, fatuously, that when the time came for license, certificate and  all that, that he would have been assured of Fairy&rsquo;s claim to respectability  and decency, if not gentility.</p>
<p>And now,&mdash;a dancer,&mdash;an assumed  name,&mdash;a hired mother! What would Dad say?</p>
<p>And then, in spite of all that, in  spite of his disillusionment, he remembered the girl herself, the sweet,  innocent face, the lovely grace of her.</p>
<p>Oh, in spite of everything, he  loved her, loved her still. And he would see to it that her death was avenged.</p>
<p>Apparently, there was no one else  in the world, to do this, and he vowed to himself, he would take the  responsibility of the quest, and would hunt down the murderer, whoever he might  be.</p>
<p>Whoever he might be? The thought  gave him pause, and he raced even faster that he might get home and learn of  any new developments.</p>
<p>At Warlock House, the day had been  passed in the interviews between the police and the guests of the house party.</p>
<p>Baird saw at once the futility and  the inadvisability of keeping that lot of important business men away from  their offices and homes, and after quizzing them all, he let most of them go.</p>
<p>Many had well-attested alibis for  the whole night. Many were such prominent members of social or financial  circles, that it seemed ridiculous to detain them.</p>
<p>So the net result was that as the  two Reeds preferred to stay on, in hope of some news of the pearl necklace, and  as Mullins, the writer of detective stories begged to stay, saying he might be  of help to the police, and as Billy Trigg refused to leave, these, with the  household were all that remained over Monday night.</p>
<p>Inspector Baird was not at all  anxious about the departing guests, for most of them aroused no suspicion in  his mind, and if some few of them did give him a moment of uncertainty, he knew  he could put his finger upon them at any moment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the worthy Inspector and  his colleague, Hunter, had pretty well made up their sagacious minds that there  was small need to look outside the household for the murderer. They didn&rsquo;t  altogether agree as to their suspects, but they were sure of the innocence of  those they had cleared.</p>
<p>Of course, the matter of the  stolen pearls must be taken up, but there was a general feeling that the two  crimes were connected, and the solution of the murder mystery would bring in  its train the discovery of the jewel robber.</p>
<p>The police had left the  questioning of Mackenzie Senior till the last and they were putting him through  an inquisition of sorts when Guy came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find the mother?&rdquo; Ralph  Mackenzie said to his son, in a cold and disdainful voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dad,&rdquo; and Guy sat down beside  him. &ldquo;I learned some things about my little girl, though, and I fear you were  right in some ways about her. She was not the type you would approve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was she? Tell me the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dancer,&rdquo; Guy said, slowly,  knowing no good could come of quibbling. &ldquo;A professional dancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you proposed to link the name  of Mackenzie to a hussy of that sort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was my idea. But you  need not fear that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;Who killed  her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea,&rdquo; Guy returned. &ldquo;Has  nothing been found out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing definite. They&rsquo;re just  now questioning me. Go on, Mr. Baird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baird went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, as I understand it,  you went over to the cottage and went to bed before the two young ladies went  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think we all went over  about the same time. I didn&rsquo;t notice, but I think a crowd of young people went  along, and after some rollicking good nights they all sorted themselves out,  and went to their rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Lovell say good night to  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that she did  definitely. She may have called out &lsquo;good night, all,&rsquo; or something like that  as she went into her room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Field was with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay. I didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it, Mr. Mackenzie, that  you were not favorably inclined toward your son&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you already know. It was  because I did not consider her a girl of proper birth, breeding or education to  be my son&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you know of her birth or  breeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what I gathered from my  observation of the lady herself. That was enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very strongly opposed to  the match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very strongly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your son know this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably suspected it, but we  had agreed to wait until the house party was over to discuss the matter  seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Now, Mr. Mackenzie, will  you tell me where you procured the packet of poison that was found in the  drawer of your bedroom dresser, beneath a pile of your shirts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no such thing there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there was. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baird produced the packet and  showed it to him. Mackenzie took it and examined it carefully, but did not open  the parcel. &ldquo;You say this is poison?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, white oxide of arsenic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know absolutely nothing about  it,&rdquo; he declared, handing it back to Baird. &ldquo;If you found it in my room, it was  put there by the murderer to incriminate me. I never saw it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. McKenzie, your finger  prints have been found on the glass from which Miss Lovell drank her deadly  draught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they not also on the glass  from which I drank milk myself last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then doesn&rsquo;t that merely prove  that the glasses had not been properly washed? Miss Lovell and I both had milk  placed in our rooms at night. Similar glasses were probably used. Hence the  similar finger marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty thin,&rdquo; Baird thought to  himself, but he added, also to himself, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mackenzie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you  know of anyone else, beside yourself, who had a motive for killing Miss Lovell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no motive,&rdquo; said the old  man, evenly. &ldquo;Although I detested and despised her, that was not sufficient to  induce murder. I did not kill the young lady, but I cannot be sorry that she is  dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Guy cried out  in a tone of utter anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Uncle,&rdquo; whispered Sylvia,  who sat beside him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do mean it,&rdquo; and Mackenzie  spoke with a deep gravity. &ldquo;She was a very bad girl. An adventuress, a grafter,  a gold-digger. She was a vain exhibitionist and a wicked self-seeker. She  cheated my son into thinking her a sweet, innocent girl, with a refined and  good mother. Do you think for a minute that is the one I would choose for my  son&rsquo;s wife? To bring forth heirs to the old name and the old estates of the  Mackenzies? No. The girl is dead, the danger is over and I am glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baird listened intently, he made a  few notes in a small book, and he shook his head a little doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am inclined to believe you, Mr.  Mackenzie, as to your innocence in this matter, but I feel I ought to warn you  that the coroner at tomorrow&rsquo;s inquest may not be so lenient. And I advise you  to curb your rancor, forget the past and relate as your testimony only the  facts you know, and omit any opinions you may hold about the young woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that, I shall take no one&rsquo;s  advice,&rdquo; Ralph Mackenzie stated, his head held high.</p>
<p>Whereupon, Guy Mackenzie went to  the telephone and begged Bob Arnold to come to him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it, Guy. Too busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Guy, against his own wishes  was forced to remind Arnold of a great favor he had once done him, and, upon  this, Arnold promised to come, to the help of his friend. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Clues</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I felt a perfect cad, old chap,  to remind you of your promise to help me out some time in return for that  flimsy favor I did for you, but truly, Bob, I was desperate, and I still am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two were in Guy&rsquo;s own suite at  Warlock House, and Arnold had asked for an account of the whole matter. He had  left important and pressing business to come to Penrose, and now here, he was  anxious to do what he could and get away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind all that,&rdquo; Bob said,  soberly, &ldquo;tell me the chief and outstanding details of this terrible thing. Who  killed her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, man, if I knew that, I  shouldn&rsquo;t have asked you to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where does the evidence  lead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t exactly lead, but it  points or seems to point to one of us three, Dad, Sylvia and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody has voiced it, but I can  see there is a vague hint of suspicion that I might have killed her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. But &lsquo;each man  kills the thing he loves,&rsquo; and all that, you know. Or, perhaps they think I  learned something to her discredit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there things to her  discredit? If I&rsquo;m to help you, Guy, you must tell me all you know or guess or  suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. Well, I suppose  there are plenty of things that some would think discreditable,&mdash;Dad  would,&mdash;Sylvia would,&mdash;but to me she was and always will be just an angel of  light,&mdash;poor little Fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to prove, first of all, that  her death was not due to the work of any of us three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then find the real criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you can. But that&rsquo;s a  secondary interest with me. Acquit us, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s, this way, Bob. I&rsquo;m  forced to believe that Fairy was not the innocent and unsophisticated girl I  thought her. So, if an investigation into her past means showing her up in a  lurid light, with a lot of sordid surroundings and questionable friends, I&rsquo;d  rather let the matter drop. Poor little girl, whatever she was or did, I&rsquo;m sure  she was more sinned against than sinning, and it is better to let sleeping dogs  lie. But unjust suspicion must not be attached to any member of my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean they suspect  Sylvia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspect isn&rsquo;t the word, but that  man Baird is an astute chap, and he sees a lot. But he doesn&rsquo;t always see  straight. He has it rooted in his mind that both Dad and Sylvia disapproved of  Fairy. Therefore, reasons Baird, one or both of them killed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he said so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no! He hasn&rsquo;t said  anything. But the inquest will be tomorrow morning and he&rsquo;ll probably dig up a  lot of side issues and misleading clues and distorted evidence that will seem  to prove his case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Now what about the missing  pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some think the robbery is  connected with the murder. Maybe so. I don&rsquo;t quite see how it can be, or how it  matters if it is. Say some cat burglar took the pearls, why should he return  and kill poor little Fairy? She had no pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the two Reeds, Mullins and  Billy Trigg, beside our own family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pick of the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And Mullins knows something  of sleuthing. But I wanted you. I can engage all sorts of private detectives,  but they are an unsatisfactory breed, and they won&rsquo;t tell you anything. I want  you, because you&rsquo;ll have my interests at heart, and, too, you&rsquo;ll tell me what  you&rsquo;re doing, without making a mystery of your own work. I want you to drop all  your other work and devote your whole time to this. It will net you more, both  by way of reputation and financially too, than half a dozen other cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already you think it a <i>cause c&eacute;lebre?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to me,&mdash;to us. I can&rsquo;t let  Dad&rsquo;s name be dragged in the dust, or Sylvia&rsquo;s. As for myself, I doubt if they  will really voice a suspicion of me. It&rsquo;s too absurd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it is. All right,  old chap, I&rsquo;ll take it on, not for emolument, or for possible fame and glory.  Not even because I&rsquo;m under eternal obligation to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I was ashamed of  having pulled that string, but I had to do it to get you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But the real reason  I&rsquo;m taking up this matter is to see justice done, to clear the innocent and, if  possible, to find the guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk! Now, what are  you going to do first? I want you primed for the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t give an advance program.  I&rsquo;ll clear out now and dress for dinner. And I&rsquo;ll talk to your father and to  Miss Field this evening. Separately, of course. All staying over here now, I  suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no further need to use the  Gersons&rsquo; cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;have they taken her away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The people from the Burial  Company came. I don&rsquo;t know what to do about that. The poor little thing seems  to have no friends, no people,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, such matters can wait  another twenty-four hours. I&rsquo;ll slip over to the cottage soon after dinner, and  take a look at the rooms there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to see Baird for  that. He has Fairy&rsquo;s room locked up. A reporter insisted on getting in,&mdash;there  have been shoals of reporters, of course,&mdash;but Baird wouldn&rsquo;t let him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, too. What did he want to  get in for? Who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrill, his name was, I think. I  don&rsquo;t know why he wanted to get in. Probably to get photographs for the picture  papers. Well, stand by me, Bob. I am not usually given to fears or forebodings  but somehow, I scent trouble ahead for Warlock House. I can take care of  myself, but I want you to help me keep Dad and Sylvia free from any  unpleasantness or annoyance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to have those two  uncheerful conditions, I expect, but we&rsquo;ll try to keep them clear of real  suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner that evening was a strange  sort of meal. Usually when death has visited a home, the family and guests are  subdued, even if not sad.</p>
<p>But in this case, except for Guy,  there was no one to mourn the passing of the willful little beauty.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie had said he was  glad. Sylvia didn&rsquo;t say that, but in her heart of hearts she was glad, except  that she was sorry for Guy. Yet even with that, she was glad the girl was out  of Guy&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And as to the others, they were  shocked by the pathos of the situation, they were humanely sorry for the  cutting off of a young life, but knowing Fairy so slightly as they did, and  being forced to the conclusion that she was&mdash;well, at any rate, a mystery,&mdash;their  attitudes were curious and expectant rather than depressed.</p>
<p>So only a semblance of grief was  shown now and then, and after a short avoidance of the subject it became more  and more the topic of discussion.</p>
<p>Arnold encouraged this, for he  wanted to get every sidelight he could on the affair.</p>
<p>Billy Trigg, who stuck close to  Sylvia&rsquo;s side, was loquacious, as always.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you two sleuths,&rdquo; he  observed to Arnold and Mullins, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of your detective instinct if  you can&rsquo;t make it work now? You ought to take a look round the bedroom, and say  the poor child was killed by a man five feet, eight inches tall, with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can that old stuff, Billy,&rdquo;  Arnold said; &ldquo;and if&rsquo; you add smoking a Trichinopoly cigar, you&rsquo;ll go head  first through the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just stopped me in time,  Bob,&rdquo; Trigg rejoined; &ldquo;but really, now, don&rsquo;t you look for clues at all, any  more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I supposed that had been done,&rdquo;  Arnold told him. &ldquo;None was found, as I understand it, except the two packets of  white powder, quite evidently planted in the rooms of Miss Field and Mr.  Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if ever I find out who put  those there&mdash;&rdquo; began Ralph Mackenzie, glowering, &ldquo;somebody shall pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were put there by the  murderer,&rdquo; Arnold stated, so positively that the older man stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Bob laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else could or would have done  it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What on earth would induce an innocent person to do such a  freakish thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, Bob,&rdquo; said Mullins,  &ldquo;some one might have done that to distract attention from the real murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was some one with  knowledge of the crime, and therefore, accessory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I grant that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t think the criminal in  this case had an accomplice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything to base that assumption  on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the general aspect as it  strikes me now. Remember I&rsquo;ve just come on. You people may know vital facts  that you haven&rsquo;t told me. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re purposely withholding them,  but you&rsquo;ve forgotten to tell them, or you think them unimportant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought we to tell everything we  know?&rdquo; Sylvia asked, her face paling a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet you ought!&rdquo; Trigg cried.  &ldquo;What are you holding out on? Don&rsquo;t do it, Sylvia. That&rsquo;s no way to help  anybody. The absolute truth is the only thing that counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know anything. I was  wondering about that queer letter in the blotting book&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What letter?&rdquo; exclaimed Arnold.  &ldquo;I knew there were more clues!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mullins told him of the letter.  The novelist had a memory for details and he remembered the letter almost word  for word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snowdrops are healed!&rdquo; Bob  mused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s gibberish. It may be code, but what would that child be doing  using a code? Are you sure those were the words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Mullins, laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Guy corroborated, &ldquo;I read  the letter. Mullins is right. But I think Fairy was so sleepy she didn&rsquo;t know  what she was writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At seven-thirty in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves it,&rdquo; Guy said,  quietly. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been seven-thirty, for the poor little thing wasn&rsquo;t  alive at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy forced himself to speak  calmly, though the difficulty in referring to the subject at all was clearly  apparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has this letter been made public  at all?&rdquo; asked Arnold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless the police have done  it,&rdquo; Guy told him. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t mentioned it to anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Sylvia said, mindful of  the adjuration to tell what she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have? To whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that reporter person. The one  called Terrill. He worried the life out of poor Jenny, asking questions about  Fairy. Jenny is discreet, you know, and she told the main facts, and when he  asked more personal questions Jenny refused to talk to him further. So he  begged her to let him speak to me. He represented it as being greatly to my  advantage to see him. Any way, Jenny told him I was out on the south terrace,  and he strolled out there. He seemed a decent sort, polite and well mannered,  so I talked to him a little. And he asked if Fairy left any sort of letter or  note. I said no, we didn&rsquo;t think it a suicide, and then I thought of that queer  letter and I told him about it. I thought it no harm, for of course, he could  get it from the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Arnold agreed. &ldquo;There  was no harm done, Miss Field. Did Terrill seem interested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer part. He seemed  very excited for a moment, and then his interest suddenly cooled, and he said  it didn&rsquo;t seem of any definite importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he think the wording, &lsquo;the  snowdrops are healed,&rsquo; rather queer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He smiled at it, but made no  comment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then did he go away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very soon after. But first he begged  me to let him see into Fairy&rsquo;s room. But of course I couldn&rsquo;t, as the police  people have the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he ask what costume Miss  Lovell wore last evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold put the question casually,  but Sylvia stared at him with wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;oh, how did  you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it. Merely that it  was a natural question for a reporter to ask, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. But he was so  insistent as to details. Did her shoes and slippers and stockings match her  gown and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, reporters love to get the  facts about costumes from the ladies. It adds to their story&rsquo;s picturesque  effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner over, Dorothy Reed attached  herself to Bob Arnold.</p>
<p>Her laudable purpose was to enlist  his powers of mystery solving for her own benefit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sure you could find my  pearls for me,&rdquo; she said, with her most appealing glance, and when Dorothy  wanted to be appealing she was usually extremely successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sure myself that I  could, Mrs. Reed,&rdquo; Bob responded, smiling at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must be patient,&rdquo; he went  on. &ldquo;If you say anything about it just now, you may utterly spoil your chances  of getting them back. Tell me again all the details of your loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Dorothy told the story of the  Sunday afternoon when the theft had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Bob warned her. &ldquo;Keep  perfectly quiet about it all, and, though I don&rsquo;t promise, I do hope to be  instrumental in getting your gems back for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party divided into groups of  two or three, and at last, Bob Arnold went for a little chat with Ralph  Mackenzie.</p>
<p>His host took him to the small  library, always the place for t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te confabs.</p>
<p>After they were comfortably  settled, Arnold said, suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that paper packet of  powder, Mr. Mackenzie? Are you shielding anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul, man! What do you  mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, no, I am not! That  is,&mdash;well,&mdash; but I don&rsquo;t see why I  should discuss this with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because I am here in the interests of you and Guy and Miss  Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you propose to do in  our interests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discover, if possible, the  murderer of Miss Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t want that  discovery made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must be the criminal  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t deny that  statement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Mr. Mackenzie, we  are talking foolishly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, I am not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prove that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is foolish for you to say that  if I don&rsquo;t want the murderer discovered, it must be because I am he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob thought a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;that is  foolish. For you may simply be shielding some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Now, see here, Mr.  Arnold, I think I am right in believing that the police and perhaps the  community at large feel pretty certain that the young lady was killed by one of  the three members of my family, my son, or Miss Field or myself. Is that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Bob said, truthfully,  &ldquo;there are people who hold such opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed there are. Well, supposing  one of us three did do the deed, I prefer that it never transpires which one it  was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my dear sir, you can&rsquo;t keep  that secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Does every murder  mystery get solved? Does the truth always come to light? You know better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know many murder mysteries are  mysteries still, after many years. That is surely true. But Guy asked me, urged  me to come up here and find out who killed his sweetheart. I am here to do my  best in the matter. Now, if you decline to help me in any way, I must go on  without your aid. But go on I must and shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you will expose the  murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t promise that, but I think  I shall at least clear the innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t one connote the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may and it may not. That  remains to be seen. But first, the guiltlessness of you three must be  established.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether we&rsquo;re guiltless or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming that you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And though the interview lasted  longer, that was the net result, that Arnold was there, primarily, to prove the  Mackenzie household innocent of crime, whatever revelation might follow. </p>
<p>Arnold strolled into the great  lounge and found there the assembled company talking on the all engrossing  subject.</p>
<p>He joined in for a time and then  went up to his room.</p>
<p>His windows faced the little  cottage of the Gersons, the bungalow where the crime had occurred nearly  twenty-four hours previously.</p>
<p>Queer, though the doctors agreed  that Fairy had died much earlier, she had written a letter dated half past  seven in the morning.</p>
<p>But it was not a vital point, for  she was assuredly dead or dying at that hour, and the letter, he had been told,  was obviously written when she was in perfect health and strength.</p>
<p>Mulling over the affair and its  ramifications, he came around to the consideration of the stolen pearls.</p>
<p>He thought of stories he had read  of open windows and crows or ravens. He remembered the poem of &ldquo;The Jackdaw of  Rheims,&rdquo; but somehow he couldn&rsquo;t feel that a bird had appropriated that string  of beautiful Oriental gems.</p>
<p>He smoked innumerable cigarettes,  he grew restless and walked up and down the room, he returned to the window and  sat at it long, almost dropping to sleep as he leaned over the sill. Yet he had  no desire to go decorously to bed and to sleep.</p>
<p>He watched the few movings about  on the lawns and terraces.</p>
<p>A belated servant or two scurried  in and crept fearfully round toward the service entrance.</p>
<p>A few windows near his own were  thrown open and then the corresponding lights went out.</p>
<p>He heard a few footfalls going  along the halls, a few doors closed, and at last the house was entirely dark  and still.</p>
<p>The Gersons&rsquo; bungalow had long  been closed for the night, and now the only sounds were those of the distant motor  cars that whirred along the main road, almost too far away to be heard at all.</p>
<p>Having gone over every point that  he knew of about the case of Fairy Lovell, Bob decided he would turn in.</p>
<p>But as he was slowly making up his  mind to it, he saw a faint light in one of the lower rooms of the Gerson house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her room, by Jove!&rdquo; he thought to  himself.</p>
<p>And though entirely without  superstition, his hair rose a little at the sight of this very dim light in the  chamber of death.</p>
<p>He knew the dead girl was not  there, and he knew,&mdash;through his vague shudder of spooky fear, &mdash;that it was no  ghost or spirit over there, but a human being, carrying a small flashlight or  candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the Gersons, I suppose,&rdquo;  he thought, but he stayed and watched.</p>
<p>Round and round the room went the  light. Now in one place for a few minutes and then moving on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to go and investigate,&rdquo; he  told himself, and rose silently and went down the non-creaking stairs and  passed cautiously out into the night.</p>
<p>It was easy by skirting the  shrubbery to get over to the bungalow without being seen. That is if anyone  were spying on his movements.</p>
<p>As he neared the small house, he  saw more clearly that somebody was in Fairy&rsquo;s room, and to judge by the  intruder&rsquo;s actions, it was some one of burglarious intent, for the shadow of  the slight, wiry figure of a man could be seen now and then passing a window.</p>
<p>Arnold crept softly up on the  porch and tried to peer in.</p>
<p>The shirred silk curtains at the  French window made it difficult, but finding a place near the edge of the pane,  Bob crouched and saw the man inside.</p>
<p>He had the appearance of a young  man, but his face was covered with a dark mask, a mere strip of silk or cloth,  with eyeholes.</p>
<p>Deeming it best to ascertain his  business, Bob watched patiently.</p>
<p>The man was certainly looking for  something.</p>
<p>He went swiftly through the  wardrobe and belongings of the dead girl, and then looked in the closet and  then the desk and then stood, perplexed and thoughtful, staring about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo; Bob wondered,  for he had learned that Fairy had but little money or jewels, and that her few  diamonds were in Guy&rsquo;s keeping.</p>
<p>&quot;Must be a letter or a  paper,&rdquo; Bob concluded, though it was almost ludicrous to associate that  butterfly girl with &ldquo;the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway, it was time for the  intruding chap to give an account of himself.</p>
<p>Arnold tapped on the glass and the  man inside whirled.</p>
<p>His light went out, and he too  went out, at the side window.</p>
<p>Bob flew around the corner of the  house like a whirlwind and had the luck to run straight into the man he was  after.</p>
<p>But the man was also after him,  and with a well-directed blow, he landed Bob one, and that ambitious detective  dropped to the ground like a log.</p>
<p>Without a backward glance the  assailant fled, disappeared into the bushes and was seen no more. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  The Inquest</b></h2>
<p>Dazed for a moment, Arnold soon  sat up and rubbed the place where the well-directed blow had fallen.</p>
<p>He seemed chagrined, rather than  indignant, and absent-mindedly drew a cigarette from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;those  Gersons have all sorts of eyes and ears. Wonder they didn&rsquo;t hear the chap. But  he was mighty quiet, and I made no noise either. I s&rsquo;pose he got &rsquo;em. Wonder  what he&rsquo;ll do with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose, feeling only slightly the  worse for the late unpleasantness. A certain tenderness about his jawbone,  testified to the skill of his assailant in giving just the right amount of  force to serve his own purpose and not enough to incommode seriously his  victim.</p>
<p>Arnold walked slowly back to  Warlock House, and, still thinking deeply, undressed and went to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nerve of him!&rdquo; he thought to  himself, &ldquo;the nerve of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he turned over and went  to sleep.</p>
<p>Next morning he went down to  breakfast to find everybody else already there.</p>
<p>They were talking excitedly over  the news from the Gersons that somebody had entered Fairy&rsquo;s room during the  night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A burglar!&rdquo; Sylvia told him.  &ldquo;What do you suppose he was after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Fairy&rsquo;s scarlet shoes,&rdquo; Bob  replied.</p>
<p>Billy Trigg looked at him  quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his height?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five feet, eight or nine.  And slightly built but very graceful, and with dark, curly hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No friend of mine,&rdquo; said Arnold.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you, Billy, thinking I&rsquo;d pal with a burglar. I&rsquo;m the  detective, not the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I forgot,&rdquo; and Trigg  looked duly penitent. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that I&rsquo;m uncertain. But,  Guy, I wish you&rsquo;d send somebody over to check up. See if the scarlet shoes  aren&rsquo;t missing. I suppose Fairy&rsquo;s clothes and things are still there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Guy, a little shortly,  for he resented the banter of the crowd. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to it, Bob.&rdquo; And then it  was time for the inquest.</p>
<p>It was held in the great lounge,  and there were few present outside the household. The jurymen were from  neighboring estates, and though in the village curiosity was rampant, not many  had the temerity to intrude at Warlock House.</p>
<p>Coroner Nasby was alert and  businesslike.</p>
<p>He addressed the jury briefly,  telling them the main facts of the case, as already discovered. He gave a short  outline of the situation, of the advent of this hitherto unknown girl, of her  reception by the head of the house, of the sudden infatuation of her fianc&eacute; for  her, and of the house party in celebration of the betrothal.</p>
<p>He ran over the events of the fatal  night, and told of the discovery of the dead girl in the morning.</p>
<p>He then called his witnesses and  questioned them pointedly and succinctly. He allowed no statements of opinions  or suppositions, but confined the testimony to facts.</p>
<p>The Gersons were among the first  witnesses.</p>
<p>They were rambling and incoherent,  and Nasby had difficulty in getting plain statements from them. Their stories  varied considerably from those they had told to Baird the morning before.</p>
<p>But both the Inspector and Coroner  felt that this was merely the result of the bewildered minds and faulty  memories of the pair and let it go at that.</p>
<p>Yet, the Gersons left an  impression of a number of people coming and going during the hours after  Sunday&rsquo;s midnight.</p>
<p>Between them they asserted sounds  of an unexplained character, but all apparently connected with the rooms  occupied by the transient guests.</p>
<p>Stress was laid on the fact that  some of these sounds of walking about occurred while Fairy was in the bathroom,  suggesting that others were moving around on the first floor.</p>
<p>The Gersons were vague as to time,  but they were both apparently of acute hearing and seemed sure of their  statements, when pinned down.</p>
<p>Sylvia, coming next, was haughty  and non-committal. It was difficult to learn anything from her, but the Coroner  was patient and persistent. If she refused to answer or took refuge in lack of  memory, he adroitly postponed the question and then put it in another way.</p>
<p>So well did he manage this, that  Sylvia almost contradicted herself several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard Miss Lovell in the  bathroom late?&rdquo; he said, in the course of his querying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sylvia returned, &ldquo;I heard  her running a bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not keep my eyes on the  clock,&rdquo; Sylvia returned, not pertly, but in a serious way, &ldquo;for I had no reason  for doing so. I know I went to my room about half past one, or a trifle  earlier. I heard Miss Lovell around for maybe an hour after that, but I can&rsquo;t  say any more definitely than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was about her room, or about  the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; and Sylvia seemed to be  thinking. &ldquo;When Mr. Guy Mackenzie came over to say good night, she stepped out  on the porch. And then later, I heard her in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be when she went for  her bath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;&mdash;Sylvia stopped short and bit  her lip. &ldquo;I mean yes,&mdash;when she went for her bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Miss Field,&rdquo; the  Coroner warned her. &ldquo;I think you heard Miss Lovell in the hall before she went  for her bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sylvia had recovered her  poise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;There is  but one bathroom, and if the door is closed we know it is occupied, and we have  to wait. It is quite on the cards that Miss Lovell had that experience and  returned to her own room to wait until the bathroom should be vacated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was glib enough now, and there  was no reason to dispute her statement, but all who heard her sensed a narrowly  escaped revelation of some vital point.</p>
<p>Bob Arnold looked at her with  inscrutable eyes and Guy regarded her with a miserable, pained glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; and Nasby spoke as if  satisfied. &ldquo;Now, you heard further sounds after Miss Lovell finally returned  from her bath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Sylvia spoke decidedly.  &ldquo;After she went to her room I heard nothing further the entire night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am positive, though of course,  as I soon fell asleep, there may have been sounds that failed to waken me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Gerson  have suggested that they heard sounds as of moving feet while Miss Lovell was  in the bathroom. Did you notice such?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a scarcely perceptible  instant of hesitation and then Sylvia said, &ldquo;No. My room adjoins the bathroom,  and the noise of the running water and of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s splashing in the  bathtub would doubtless drown other sounds. But I cannot think there were any&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opinions are not asked. We are  trying to find out if any intruder came into the house that night, but we want  only direct witnessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few more questions were put,  regarding the advent and reception of Miss Lovell at Warlock House, and then  Sylvia was excused.</p>
<p>Nothing had been learned from her  testimony, but Baird was positive he had learned something from what she had  not said. He was sure that while Fairy was in the bathroom, Sylvia had heard  footsteps in the house, and had recognized them as one or other of the  Mackenzies.</p>
<p>The Inspector was as yet uncertain  which of these men was the criminal, but unless it were Sylvia herself, he  suspected one of the others. The father, for choice; yet he could imagine Guy,  overpowered by despair at the whole situation or, perhaps having learned some  of the derogatory facts of Fairy&rsquo;s life, losing his faith in her, and coming  over secretly to poison her glass of milk. And, of course, there was still  Sylvia to suspect. Motive, jealousy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Baird reflected, it had to  be one of them, the question was, which one? And only prying and prodding could  prove that.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie was most  unsatisfying.</p>
<p>With utmost dignity and courtesy,  he deposed that he went to bed on his arrival at the bungalow, and had not  stirred from it until morning, when he went over to Warlock House, before his  own housemates were about at all.</p>
<p>No amount of quizzing could shake  his story or bring out any addition to it.</p>
<p>Guy was little more loquacious. He  told of his short visit at the bungalow to say a last good night to the girl he  loved, then, he said, he returned to his cronies, and knew nothing of the  tragedy until summoned in the morning by Gerson.</p>
<p>The house servants had no  testimony to add, for they knew nothing of the matter at all, except by  hearsay.</p>
<p>The guests had nothing to add,  though they were grilled a bit as to Fairy&rsquo;s appearance and behavior.</p>
<p>Wherefore, it seemed to Baird and  also to Nasby that the net was tightening in round the three suspects.</p>
<p>And then, Mullins said, suddenly,  as if just remembering it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw somebody on the porch of  the Gerson house that night, very late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the Coroner, turning  to him.</p>
<p>Now Coroner Nasby was an astute  reasoner, and it quickly occurred to him that Mr. Mullins hadn&rsquo;t seen any such  person, but that he was building up a man of straw in order to assist his  friends in their predicament. Moreover, this man Mullins was a writer of  detective fiction, and he would well know the value of the introduction of a  new suspect at this critical juncture.</p>
<p>So Nasby, with a show of interest,  but with a wary eye, asked Mullins for further information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had just gone up to my  bedroom,&rdquo; he began, when he was interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was this? You note such  details, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no irony in the tone,  merely a polite question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was late. I should say  about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. It was our last night together here, and we  talked over old times and wondered if we&rsquo;d ever all be together again. We broke  conclave about three, eh, Trigg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few minutes earlier,&rdquo; Billy  said; &ldquo;I was up in my room by three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Mullins. &ldquo;Well, as  I undressed, I glanced out of the window and was surprised to see lights still  on in the bungalow. I didn&rsquo;t think much about it, but as I looked I saw a man  step up on the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stealthily?&rdquo; asked Nasby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not noticeably so. He paused at  the lighted window&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lovell&rsquo;s window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was. I didn&rsquo;t know it then,  but I do now. Yes, he paused at that window, and remained there a few moments,  then he stepped inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The window was open, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a French  window, you know, and it either was already unfastened, or some one inside let  him in. At any rate, he did step inside and remained a few moments, not so long  as five minutes I should say, and then he reappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Coroner&rsquo;s tone could not quite  be described as quizzical, but it tended in that direction. As a matter of  fact, he didn&rsquo;t believe a word Mullins was saying, but he must hear him  through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went away. That is, he came  down the steps and disappeared from my sight. That&rsquo;s all I know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you mentioned this  incident before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no occasion to do so,&rdquo;  Mullins returned, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you describe the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not definitely, I&rsquo;m afraid. There  was moonlight enough to see him by, but not to distinguish his features or  clothing. He seemed of about medium height and weight and he wore dark clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A soft hat of some sort. Dark,  too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very indicative. Did he enter  the window as if he had a right to, or furtively, as a burglar might?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to judge, as I saw  him only indistinctly. But he walked steadily in, as one meeting no repulse.  And soon, he came out again, unhurried, as one who had completed his errand,  whatever it might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gathered a great deal,  considering your vague glimpses.&rdquo; Nasby&rsquo;s tone now was frankly sarcastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I may have gathered it  wrong,&rdquo; Mullins returned, ignoring any irony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite likely. Well, Mr. Mullins,  your man is interesting, if shadowy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t believe in him,  Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; Mullins said, smiling a little, &ldquo;but I give you my word of honor  it is entirely true, just as I have related it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Mullins, it is of the  greatest importance. For if such an intruder was in Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room at three  o&rsquo;clock, either he was the murderer or he saw the dead girl at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mullins, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell us nothing further  on the subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another word. I watched for a  time after that, but I saw nothing more of him or of anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think was the  explanation of the scene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave it no thought. It was none  of my business what callers Miss Lovell had or what time they came or went. I  only chanced to look over there at all, because I saw the man on the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You noted nothing familiar in his  figure or gait, even though you could not see his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all. I thought no more  about the matter, until I learned of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s untimely death, and then I  wondered if that man had anything to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not remind you in any way  of any member of this household or this house party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not, and had he been one  of us, he would not have worn a hat to cross the lawns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a facer, and Baird, who  was already building air castles, saw them topple over suddenly.</p>
<p>Mullins was dismissed and a few  questions from the Coroner proved that no other occupant of Warlock House had  seen the stranger that Mullins had told of.</p>
<p>Some present, beside the police,  thought that Mullins, in spite of his asserveration, had made up the yarn, in  hope of averting suspicion from the Mackenzies.</p>
<p>Guy, though he had a vague idea  this might be the case, was so utterly miserable that he paid little attention  to the story. He glanced at his father, but no one could read that inscrutable  countenance.</p>
<p>And then, Parsons, the detective  was called to the witness stand.</p>
<p>After the preliminaries, Parsons  told of his finding the so-called mother of the dead girl.</p>
<p>At this, Guy straightened up, and  with a hard, set face, he prepared to listen.</p>
<p>It was not a pretty story, and it  proved anew how a guileless, infantile exterior may hide a sophisticated and  erring nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found the lady easily enough,&rdquo;  Parsons began. &ldquo;And she was willing enough to talk. It seems she and Miss  Lovell have long been pals. Miss Grant, Miss Lora Grant is a little older, and  possesses an especial talent for making up in mother parts. She has played them  in the movies repeatedly. So, on occasion, she does such service for girls who  are in need of a mother-chaperon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is paid for such service?&rdquo;  asked Nasby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, well paid. For the young  ladies who want a &lsquo;mother&rsquo; are usually engaged in acquiring some millionaire or  society man who must be led to think them demure and innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Guy was writhing in his heart,  his white, stern face gave no hint of it.</p>
<p>Nor did the elder Mackenzie show  any annoyance or embarrassment.</p>
<p>Sylvia wanted to scream out, in  her agonized sensitiveness, but noting the demeanor of the other two, she  preserved her air of calm hauteur.</p>
<p>Bob Arnold, watching,  congratulated all three, in his thoughts, and voted them good sports.</p>
<p>Parsons proceeded. With only a few  aiding queries from the Coroner, he told his own story.</p>
<p>The two girls, Lora Grant had  informed him, ran away from their homes to go on the stage. Unable, however, to  succeed in this plan, Miss Grant had taken to the films and Miss Lovell had  become a dancer. Several times, they had been noticed and admired by wealthy  and worthwhile men, but nothing had ever come of these romances.</p>
<p>More than once, Miss Grant had  played &ldquo;mother&rdquo; to the lovely Goldie Glenn, but every time something had  interfered with the expected, even promised marriage.</p>
<p>This time, it seemed that the real  opportunity had arrived, and Goldie Glenn had promised Lora if she would play  mother once more, it would never be necessary again. Miss Grant did not enjoy  the role, it was too dull, and, too, Goldie was exigent in her demands for most  careful mannerisms and talk.</p>
<p>But Lora had done her part, and  when, at last, Goldie had set off for Warlock House, Lora had folded her tent,  too, and silently sneaked away.</p>
<p>There was little to be added to  this part of the tale. It was all so usual, so trite, as to be easily believed  and understood.</p>
<p>Nor was it strange that Guy had  been hoodwinked.</p>
<p>Though far from unsophisticated,  he was unversed in the ways of the adventuress type, and he was more easily  gulled than a gayer and more frivolous man would have been.</p>
<p>And he had been bowled over by  Fairy&rsquo;s beauty and charm. Meeting her, as he did, at a friend&rsquo;s studio tea, he  had never associated her with dancing or cabaret performances, and she took  care that he never should.</p>
<p>His love at first sight had caused  her to hasten to a pleasant and correct home and set up what seemed to be a  pleasant and correct mother.</p>
<p>Guy was completely fooled, and he  carried on so rapidly, and Fairy met his advances so cleverly, that inside of a  fortnight they were engaged, and another week saw the house party in progress.</p>
<p>Had Fairy been less consummately  clever she could not have put the thing over, but she did do it, and all went  successfully until she lost her head, and let herself go in the matter of the  fancy dance.</p>
<p>Well, all this was brought out in  Parsons&rsquo; recital, and the Grant woman could be seen at any time if  corroboration were necessary.</p>
<p>Then came the crowning misery of  all, for the Mackenzie faction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Miss Lovell, as we will call  her, danced at cabarets and night clubs?&rdquo; the Coroner said, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Parsons replied, &ldquo;under the  name of Goldie Glenn. I don&rsquo;t know her real name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such dancers have a partner,  usually, do they not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; Parsons assured him.  &ldquo;Sidekicks, they are called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Glenn had one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had various and sundry. The  present one is Blackie Blake, a well-known dancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. I saw him last night  after my interview with Miss Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he doing his dancing  stunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was. I waited for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until the night club closed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no! I&rsquo;d be there yet! I saw  him between dances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told him of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s  tragic death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he burst into tears.  Genuine, real tears. He must have had a soft spot in his heart for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy&rsquo;s white face was motionless,  except that those who knew him well could see a certain small muscle twitching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose even a dancer is  human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, all right. Though of  course, anybody would grieve at the death of a beauty like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man, what does he look  like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a lounge lizard, but with a  little more backbone than most of them have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just an ordinary looking  chap. Average measurements, I&rsquo;d say. Pink cheeks, white teeth and black  moustache and frizzy black hair. He gets his nickname Blackie Blake from his  raven locks. He&rsquo;s a good dresser and he has decent manners. And I guess that&rsquo;s  all there is about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he express any opinion as to  who could have killed Miss Lovell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d care  for opinions &mdash;exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some instances, no. In this  case, yes. What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he wasn&rsquo;t surprised. He  said it was coming to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parsons fidgeted. Clearly, he  hated to answer these questions.</p>
<p>But Nasby repeated, and Parsons  forced himself to the ordeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he meant,&mdash;he seemed to mean  that as Miss Glenn had fooled a man into believing her lies, if he,&mdash;the man,&mdash;should  find out, he would&mdash;he would kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he thought it would be just  retribution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t put it just that way,  he only said she asked for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he said this, with no further  knowledge of the circumstances than you gave him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know. The story was  in the evening papers. Of course, when I told him about it, and he burst out  crying, that didn&rsquo;t prove he didn&rsquo;t know of it before. He could cry twice, I  suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Nasby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  The Packets</b></h2>
<p>It was patent from Parsons&rsquo;  statements that the debonair Blackie had implied that it was or might have been  Guy who was responsible for the sudden termination of the earthly career of  pretty little Fairy.</p>
<p>But this was all too vague and  uncertain to be considered evidence and Nasby made no direct comment on it.</p>
<p>He felt that Fairy&rsquo;s past must be  more carefully looked into. It must be learned what friends or enemies she  might have beside the versatile Lora and the emotional Blackie. And it must be  found out whether Guy knew any of the details of the story outlined by Parsons.</p>
<p>If it was all news to Guy, there  was small reason for suspecting him of the crime. But if he had learned of the  girl&rsquo;s deceit and pretense, there was a possibility that Blackie&rsquo;s theory was  the right one.</p>
<p>And, of course, Guy could have  learned the truth from Fairy, in some accidental way during her stay at Warlock  House.</p>
<p>So Coroner Nasby deemed it wise to  adjourn the inquest for a week, that more data might be gathered and more  evidence be sifted.</p>
<p>The small crowd dispersed and  Inspector Baird promptly requested Arnold and Mullins to join him in a  conference.</p>
<p>In order to be alone, they went  over to the Guest House, now empty, as the few remaining visitors were  quartered in the big house.</p>
<p>When they were comfortably settled  in the pleasant living room, Baird and Hunter took up the investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; Baird began, &ldquo;that you  two gentlemen both saw intruders at the gardener&rsquo;s bungalow, whose identity has  yet to be learned. You, Mr. Mullins, told of a suspicious character over there  at three o&rsquo;clock Sunday morning, while you, Mr. Arnold, saw and met a strange  man there late Monday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him more distinctly than I  saw him,&rdquo; Bob said, gently rubbing his still swollen jaw. &ldquo;But he was assuredly  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You first, Mr. Mullins,&rdquo; Hunter  suggested. &ldquo;Your man of Sunday night, may be Mr. Arnold&rsquo;s man of Monday night.  We want to find out. Now, can&rsquo;t you add any details to the story you&rsquo;ve already  told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can. As I said,  it was about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning and while there was moonlight, the  shadows were deep and I saw the man only as a vague personality. There was  nothing distinct about his gait or manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what direction did he come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came around the corner of the  house, as if coming from the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had come from outside, from  the highroad and through the gate, that is the way he would come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be the natural way of  entrance, but he may have been hiding in the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You exclude the idea that he may  have belonged here? One of the house party or one of the servants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because he wore a hat. It  would not be likely for anyone belonging on the premises to wear a hat. Say it  was a servant, perhaps carrying a note or message to Miss Lovell, he would not  have a hat on. Or if a member of our crowd had any occasion to speak to Miss  Lovell at that hour, he would scarcely put on a hat to run across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all true,&rdquo; and Baird  looked very thoughtful. &ldquo;You seem to omit all thought of a sinister motive in  this man&rsquo;s visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that I cannot say. I&rsquo;m  merely relating the facts. I saw him arrive, enter the room, depart,&mdash;all within  five minutes. What he did inside, I cannot say. He may have added the poison to  Miss Lovell&rsquo;s glass of milk, or he may not. I&rsquo;ve no means of knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either he did,&rdquo; Hunter observed,  &ldquo;or it had been done by somebody previously. For later than that hour would not  have left time enough for the poison to do its work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is,&rdquo; Baird insisted,  &ldquo;to get a line on this man. Try hard, Mr. Mullins, close your eyes and  visualize the scene. Can&rsquo;t you think of some outstanding feature? Did he wear  evening dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. As I say, I  couldn&rsquo;t see him clearly, nor did I pay much attention to him. But as I  memorize it, he didn&rsquo;t register in my mind as being in evening clothes. Yet he  may have been. I think, Inspector, I&rsquo;ve told you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come into your view  suddenly, as if arriving, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Inspector, if you keep on  you&rsquo;ll have me romancing. It&rsquo;s my trade, you know, and it&rsquo;s a terrible  temptation to invent a lot of gestures for this mysterious and interesting  character. However, I&rsquo;ll say this. He didn&rsquo;t burst into sight as if suddenly  arriving. It was more as if he had been watching and waiting, and then, the  time being ripe, he stepped in at the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time you stopped, Mull,&rdquo; Bob  Arnold said, smiling. &ldquo;You are getting perilously near romancing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Guess I&rsquo;ll shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man must be found,&rdquo; Hunter  said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve little to go on, except his hat. Soft hat, Mr. Mullins, you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Fedora, Alpine, whatever you  call it. Not a straw. I could gather that from his silhouette, though of course  I don&rsquo;t know the color of the hat. Light gray, probably, or tan. Anyway, not black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helpful!&rdquo; said Bob, not in  sarcasm, but with good-natured banter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Arnold, now for  your mysterious stranger. Can you be more definite in description?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Fraid not,&rdquo; Bob smiled. &ldquo;You  see, I interviewed my man at closer range, and so lacked the perspective which  gave Mr. Mullins his advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did your man, as we will  call him, want the scarlet shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; cried Bob, suddenly,  &ldquo;how do you know so much about all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you told the story at the  breakfast table,&rdquo; Mullins put in. &ldquo;We were all there, and the servants were in  and out,&mdash;it&rsquo;s not surprising the thing is common property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; Bob smiled.  &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no secret about it. By the way, did he get the scarlet shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; Hunter said,  &ldquo;they&rsquo;re missing. So the assumption is he did. But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Bob  replied, slowly. &ldquo;Maybe he was an admirer of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s dancing and so  wanted her slippers as a souvenir. Maybe he was that very persistent reporter  who pestered Miss Field as to what costume Fairy wore the night she died, and  took the shoes she had on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; and Hunter eyed  him closely. &ldquo;When you told of the chap&rsquo;s attack on you, you said at once he  had come for those shoes. Did he tell you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not,&rdquo; declared Bob. &ldquo;He  told me nothing. I&mdash;I felt the shoes in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth, Mr. Arnold?&rdquo;  asked Baird, very seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Inspector, that&rsquo;s the truth.  I felt them, and was about to snatch them from his pocket, when he gave me a biff  and down I went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe again the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a light in Fairy&rsquo;s room, a  dim light, and I went over to investigate. If it was Guy, mooning around, I  should have left without intrusion on his grief. If it was the Gersons, they  had a right there. But when I saw it was a strange man, with a mask on, I felt  justified in stepping in and asking his business. As I went in at the French  window,&mdash;or rather as I started to go in, he wheeled about, saw me, doused his  glim and hopped out the side window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s high up from the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I found afterward he had  drawn up a garden bench. Probably used it to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He jumped out to his bench&mdash;go  on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing that, I hopped off the end  of the porch to meet him at the corner of the house. I did. We made for each  other, and I tried to grab him. As he whirled, I felt the shoes or something  that shape in his pocket, and then he let me have it, and I went over. You see,  I wasn&rsquo;t expecting such a reception and I was taken unaware. I was all right in  a minute, but by that time, friend burglar had vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And now describe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These descriptions!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do  they ever get anybody anywhere? Well, he was about my height, about everybody&rsquo;s  height, except freaks, say, five feet, eight or nine. And he had dark, curly  hair,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kinky?&rdquo; asked Mullins, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it, Mull. It was, it  must have been the redoubtable Blackie, the dancing partner of Fairy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is emotional, therefore  sentimental, therefore who wanted her little red shoes to remember her by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunter looked at the two men with  undisguised admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all fits!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Baird objected, &ldquo;why burgle  for a pair of slippers? If the fellow had come and asked for them, doubtless no  one would have objected to his having them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there you are,&rdquo; Bob said.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you all I know about it. Now go on from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was nothing else missing from the  room?&rdquo; Mullins inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Hunter returned.  &ldquo;The maid, Jenny, is checking up. It seems she knew more about Miss Lovell&rsquo;s  belongings than anyone else. Strange situation, isn&rsquo;t it? What&rsquo;s to be done  with the wardrobe? And incidentally, with the body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; and  Mullins looked aghast. &ldquo;What about a funeral and all that? Mr. Mackenzie will  never consent to bury her in his family plot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reason why he should,&rdquo; said  Bob. &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t Guy&rsquo;s wife, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Guy Mackenzie will have to  settle those questions,&rdquo; Baird told him. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d send for Jenny, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny was summoned, and red-eyed  and sniffling, she replied to their queries.</p>
<p>Yes, the scarlet shoes were gone.  No, nothing else was missing. Yes, Miss Lovell had possessed a few  insignificant bits of jewelry, which still lay on her jewel tray. No, her purse  had not been taken.</p>
<p>Then Jenny was asked concerning  the reporter who was so anxious to get into Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Her description was vague, but  when Mullins asked if he had curly dark hair, Jenny said he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same man!&rdquo; Hunter cried, as Jenny  was dismissed and the others resumed their discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, and maybe not,&rdquo; Bob  demurred. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much of a coincidence that all marauding strangers should  be one and the same person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a coincidence,&rdquo;  Mullins told him, &ldquo;that three of them should have dark, curly hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you get your three?&rdquo;  asked Bob. &quot;Did your shadowy man have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mullins, &ldquo;not that I  know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your three are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pugilist, Jenny&rsquo;s reporter  and Parsons&rsquo; dancing boy. They are one and the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be.&rdquo; Bob thought it over.  &ldquo;But if so, it can be proved, can&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to prove it,&rdquo; said the  Inspector, hopefully. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll clear out now and get busy about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Baird and Hunter departed, and  the two young detectives settled down for a resume of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Bob began, &ldquo;Guy wanted  me to come into this thing and investigate. Now, he&rsquo;s scared stiff as to what  investigation may bring forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your deeply rooted  conviction?&rdquo; Mullins asked him, speaking casually but keeping a sharp eye out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a messy case,&rdquo; Arnold  returned, slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure myself it isn&rsquo;t best to let sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That leaves the three people in  the house under possible suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even that might be better  than the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the truth&mdash;as you see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are Dorothy Reed&rsquo;s  pearls, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are Dorothy Reed&rsquo;s pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mullins, do you mean to say  you don&rsquo;t know where they are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t! Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not produce them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the man who dropped  his watch overboard? He knew where it was, but he couldn&rsquo;t produce it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Arnold, I wonder if  you are smarter than I thought you were, or if you&rsquo;re chucking a bluff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Bob, without smiling.  &ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s get over to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young people were on the  terrace, but Bob sought Ralph Mackenzie in his small library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; Arnold said, as he  was welcomed by the older man, &ldquo;we might talk things over a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Arnold. What can I do for  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advise me. Guy is so upset and  so,&mdash;well, touchy,&mdash;that I can&rsquo;t do much with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, and small wonder, poor  boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now, Mr. Mackenzie, what is  your wish as to the funeral services?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought that matter over,  and though at first I couldn&rsquo;t stand the idea of having that girl connected in  any way with my family, yet, after all, she was Guy&rsquo;s choice, he loved her, and  I now feel that due respect should be paid to her. She seems to have no kith or  kin, so far as we know, therefore, I propose that she be given proper ritual  and decent burial. Let the services be in the church here, and let her be  buried in the Penrose cemetery. Of course, if any relatives or friends should  turn up, these plans can be changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob looked at him thoughtfully.  How the man&rsquo;s manner and attitude had changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who killed her, Mr. Mackenzie?&rdquo;  he said, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one connected with her past  life. Some one who resented her good fortune in marrying Guy. Some jealous man  or woman who hated her and who was unwilling that she should have happiness and  prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one from the city&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Doubtless the man Mr.  Mullins saw prowling about. Now, Arnold, naturally you must do what Guy wants,  but try to persuade him to call off the hunt. It can be of no real interest to  us to know the murderer, and I want my boy to forget it all and later on, when  he gets back his poise and resumes his normal life, he will look back on it as  a brief episode in his career, and it will fade to a vague memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech sounded natural enough,  but Bob Arnold detected an undertone of suppressed excitement, a stressed  emphasis that made it seem as if the speaker were trying to impress on his  hearer a plausible but untrue statement.</p>
<p>His eyes glittered, his hands were  nervously clenched and his whole demeanor was that of a man determined to make  his point against all odds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows something!&rdquo; was Bob&rsquo;s  mental decision, but he merely said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough, Mr. Mackenzie. The  fact that Guy&rsquo;s acquaintance with the girl was so short, his love affair so  fleeting, makes it likely he will soon be able to forget. And, too, he is  already somewhat disillusioned,&mdash;he has to be, after the revelations of  Parsons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; and Mackenzie spoke  eagerly. &ldquo;He is disillusioned and will become more so. But hush it all up,  can&rsquo;t you? Persuade the police to let the matter drop. Why should they go on  when there is no one who wishes them to do so? If the girl had people who  demanded justice it would be different. But, as you know, any further  developments would in all probability lead only to further disparagement of her  character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in what you  say,&rdquo; Bob returned, &ldquo;and left to themselves, I doubt if the police will go very  far. There&rsquo;s the expense to be considered, too. The State has its case, but  without some interested parties to prod and push, they may let the thing drift  along until it comes to a standstill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I truly hope so. Only harm can  come from further investigation. The little girl is gone, let her rest in  peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the man showed that nervous  excitement; again his voice was jerky and his speech overemphasized.</p>
<p>Bob determined to make one more  effort to understand this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we could find that man  Mullins saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t see any man,&rdquo; Mackenzie  spoke in a whisper and leaning over, peered into Bob&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s to help  Guy out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Appalled at this, Bob thought,  &ldquo;Good Heavens, he suspects Guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the other read his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, quickly, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think Guy killed the girl, but others are going to think so. And if  suspicion attaches itself to Guy, it may go hard to disprove accusations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can be disproved only by  learning the truth,&rdquo; Bob said, seriously. &ldquo;Now, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; and Ralph Mackenzie rose in  his wrath. &ldquo;No, it would not be better to probe and pry any more. If you do, if  you insist on digging into the matter, I shall confess to the murder and give  myself up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would your confession be a  true one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob said this so quietly and  casually that the other fell into his trap. He started indignantly, and then,  realizing quickly that he was stultifying himself, he changed his countenance  instantly to a mask of candor and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; Bob thought to  himself. &ldquo;I saw the truth in your sudden anger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aloud, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Mr. Mackenzie. It  would be both useless and foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me out, Arnold,&rdquo; came the  unexpected plea. &ldquo;Be on my side. Do all you can to close the case and let the  matter rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the pearl necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that connected with the girl&rsquo;s  death? How can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know myself how it may  be, but I feel sure the two cases are connected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t take up the  business of the pearls without dragging in the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then drop the pearl question,  also. The Reeds can get some one else to hunt their missing jewelry, some one  who does not consider the two cases so intertwined. I will do all I can to help  them, but not if it is in the hands of one who mixes the matters. You&rsquo;ve  waiting business, I know. Go back to it, I will see that you lose nothing by  this. Tell Guy you can do no more. Go away, and Guy will forget. Stay here, and  keep the wound open, and he will worry himself sick over the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I understood you, Mr.  Mackenzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t wish that. And if  you do, you&rsquo;d better change your mind. But think over what I&rsquo;ve said, and do as  I&rsquo;ve asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plainly the interview was at an  end, but as Bob was leaving the room, he turned to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise nothing, except to  think over what you have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment he almost ran into  Sylvia, who mutely beckoned him to follow her.</p>
<p>She led him out a side door to a  secluded arbor, and said, directly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Arnold, I must have a talk  with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Miss Field, I&rsquo;m only  too glad to agree to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat down in the arbor, and  after a moment the girl said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Arnold, you know as well as I  do, who killed Fairy Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dumbfounded, Arnold responded,  truthfully: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea whom you have in mind, Miss Field, and I think, to  avoid cross purposes, you&rsquo;d better tell me frankly. I promise secrecy, if you  wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, there can be no doubt  that Mr. Mackenzie did it. Oh, I am not speaking at random. Guy thinks so too,  and we want the affair hushed up. You know, Mr. Mackenzie is a strange man. He  would feel that his act was not a crime, but a righteous deed, to prevent the  union of that child of misfortune with his idolized son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you are making grave  accusations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know it. But look at the  facts. There is no one else in the house who had any reason to wish the girl out  of existence. It has been suggested that I, myself, with a jealous motive,  might desire her removal; but, though I admit I was jealous of her, my interest  in Guy&rsquo;s happiness is so great that if it would insure it I would willingly  bring her back to life, if I could. No. I did not bring about Fairy&rsquo;s death,  and most certainly Guy did not. Remains only Uncle Ralph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the intruder whom Mullins saw  late that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mullins didn&rsquo;t see anybody.  He made that up. But, anyway, whoever killed Fairy was the one who put the  packets of poison powder in Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s room and mine, as false clues for  the detectives to work upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in your two rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of his cleverness. If  it is supposed that they were planted clues it exonerates both Mr. Mackenzie  and myself. Also Guy. No one would imagine him committing a crime and drawing  suspicion on his father and on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; said Bob,  after a moment&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gersons or any servants are  out of the question. Those who knew Fairy adored her. Moreover, none of them  has brains enough to cook up the plan of the two packets of poison. Nor could  they obtain the arsenic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could Mr. Mackenzie get it?  It is not for sale to a layman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, anybody with brains  and determination could get it. Anyway, the murderer did get it. You can&rsquo;t get  away from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t get away from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to argue this  thing, I only want to tell you that Mr. Mackenzie had motive and opportunity  and means. Nobody else had all three. So both Guy and I, much as we hate to  admit it, feel that it must have been he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  The Detective</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And what does Guy want me to do?&rdquo;  Bob said, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He doesn&rsquo;t know,  himself. He&rsquo;s going to talk to you, but I wanted to talk to you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he still love the girl&mdash;or  her memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Sylvia&rsquo;s  cheeks turned a little pinker. &ldquo;You see, he has to believe all these things  about her&mdash;her past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. And what seems to  you the best course for us, Guy&rsquo;s friends, to take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that suspicion must be  averted from this household. Not making it evident that we are acquitting Mr.  Mackenzie, but somehow vindicating the three of us at once. Then pin the crime  on some stranger, some intruder who is and who shall remain nameless. We don&rsquo;t  want any innocent person to suffer suspicion, but we do want all danger of  accusation removed from us all and especially from Uncle Ralph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re asking me to compound  a felony and to become an accessory after the fact and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you to do anything  that Guy and I are not willing to do!&rdquo; Sylvia&rsquo;s eyes blazed. &ldquo;If we can do  those things, surely you can. And it is not as if we were implicating anybody  else. We just want help in fastening the deed on an imaginary person, say the  man Mr. Mullins saw, who never can be found. Oh, don&rsquo;t look at it in the wrong  light! See it as we do,&mdash;as we must! We are going to save Uncle Ralph at all  costs and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he didn&rsquo;t do it, after  all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who did? And look at the  facts, the proofs. He had his glass of milk, she had hers. The glasses were  just alike. What could be easier than for him to put the poison in his own  glass and then exchange it for hers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob Arnold looked at her in utter  amazement, Sylvia never forgot that look. He seemed to think her uncanny or  clairvoyant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have heard him go to  her room,&rdquo; he said, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; she returned, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did hear Mr. Mackenzie go to Miss  Lovell&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard soft footfalls in the  hall and I heard her door open and close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but very  late. About three o&rsquo;clock or so. Of course I thought nothing about the time  then, not dreaming it would ever be of any importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;re sure about all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly sure I heard his  door open and later close. I heard her door open and later close. I heard the  footsteps across the hall. Now is there any other explanation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gersons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would they open or close his  door? And, too, Mrs. Gerson adored Fairy and Mr. Gerson had no interest in the  affairs of his superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And you think Mr. Mackenzie  fixed up the powder packets to seem like a plant that should incriminate you  two, yet, should be so palpably a plant that it would really exonerate you two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just exactly that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It worked very well, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia flushed angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t believe all this,  Mr. Arnold,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe most of it,&rdquo; he said,  seriously. &ldquo;But I am uncertain what to do about it all. Will you give me time  to think it over? I want to do what is best tor all concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including Guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy first of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take all the time you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob Arnold walked away, a greatly  puzzled man. What, pray, was he to do now?</p>
<p>He wished he had never come to  Warlock House at all. Wished he had refused Guy&rsquo;s plea, even at risk of losing  the good old chap&rsquo;s friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; he  soliloquized. &ldquo;To think of a worthless little scrap of femininity like that  turning the heads of worthwhile men! It&rsquo;s too rotten! And I&rsquo;m in it up to my  neck. Guess I&rsquo;d better clear out while the clearing&rsquo;s good. How can I ever prove  those three blessed people innocent when there&rsquo;s absolutely no clue pointing in  any other direction? And Sylvia heard footsteps in the hall! And she thinks  Guy&rsquo;s Dad put the stuff in his own glass and then exchanged it with Fairy&rsquo;s!  Clever, oh, very clever! And that would explain both their finger prints on  both the glasses. Yes, of course it would! If that story comes out it&rsquo;s all up  with Mr. Dad. And the two youngsters believe him guilty. Well, how can they  help it? And he did hate the little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must think this over  calmly&mdash;slowly. There&rsquo;s a lot to be considered. Shall I tell the truth and clear  out? Or shall I clear out first, and then send a letter back to Guy telling him  the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the truth, old chap?&rdquo; and  Billy Trigg appeared at his elbow and fell into step with him. &ldquo;Bad plan to  think out loud, unless you mean to be overheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Bob,  undisturbed at the sudden appearance of an eavesdropper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a quandary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gathered that from your slow,  stalking step and your rapt countenance. If you hadn&rsquo;t been mumbling, I  shouldn&rsquo;t have intruded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t guy me, Billy, I&rsquo;m up  against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Struck a snag in your detective  work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trigg&rsquo;s voice was kindness itself,  but he showed curiosity in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bob returned, &ldquo;you see, I  know something I can&rsquo;t tell, and what I want to tell I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cryptic enough for Holmes  himself. I say, though, Bob, I&rsquo;ve heard the police are getting busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been busy all along.  Police are, you know. The stories of their lethargy or stupidity are all  poppycock. Hunter is a good sleuth, and if he doesn&rsquo;t make more or rapider  progress it isn&rsquo;t his fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. But what  bothers me is, he says there&rsquo;s no way to look but in the trio of the family  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other ways to look, but  nothing to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think one of the three  guilty, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. But who is? I&rsquo;d like  to drop back on the suicide theory, but no one will listen to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mullins&rsquo; man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mullins&rsquo; man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think Mullins invented  him, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mullins has imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, you&rsquo;re impossible this  morning! Is it in your detective formula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m upset, Billy, terribly  upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in love, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think because that&rsquo;s your  ailment, everybody else must have it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy Trigg went red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when you gaze after Sylvia  like a moonstruck calf and glower at Guy every time he goes near her, it  doesn&rsquo;t require a super-Sherlock to wrestle with the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Seer, go further.  What does Sylvia think about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know you exist. I  don&rsquo;t want to hurt you old chap, but our Sylvia has eyes for none but Guy. She  fiercely resented his affair with the little girl, but she is so devoted that  if that was what Guy wanted, then that he must have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t seem to resent it when  Fairy was&mdash; was alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Sylvia&rsquo;s the  unselfish sort. She was lovely to the girl, for Guy&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t&mdash;didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill her? No, she did not. You  see, and nobody seems to remember it, that little piece of wickedness had a  past. And a longer past than some people think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning she was older than we  thought her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some several years older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great detective can note the  ravages of time that escape the attention of the multitude. And Fairy was an  adept at make-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she didn&rsquo;t use any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, but so cleverly that  it seemed:</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Beauty truly blent&rsquo; whose red and  white<br>
Nature&rsquo;s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>as Shakespeare describes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looked like that.  Poor little girl, whatever she was, she was as lovely as an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Fairy?&rdquo; and Dorothy Reed  joined the two men, while her husband followed. &ldquo;How can you call her an  angel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Dot,&rdquo; warned Egbert Reed,  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let yourself go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Let&rsquo;s not talk about her at  all. Let&rsquo;s go back to my pearls. Who do you s&rsquo;pose is coming to find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To find them!&rdquo; echoed Bob,  wheeling in his tracks to look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Guy just now had a telegram  from Kit Cox and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cox! Really?&rdquo; cried Bob Arnold.  &ldquo;What luck! I thought he was abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just got back, and hearing about  this case offered his services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Guy accepted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;he did,&rdquo; and Dorothy  hesitated a little. &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em about it, Egbert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed looked a bit embarrassed, but  he said, &ldquo;You see, Guy wasn&rsquo;t crazy about having Cox&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Arnold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe he thought it  would seem like shunting you. Maybe there was some other reason. But Dorothy  wants him, Cox, to chase her pearls, and we urged Guy to let him come here for  a few days anyway. So Guy agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mullins says you know where  my pearls are,&rdquo; Dorothy said, looking at Bob dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dotty, I don&rsquo;t know where  they are. I have a theory, but I can&rsquo;t get it worked out yet. Likely Cox can  recover them. Cox is the real thing, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in your class, too, wasn&rsquo;t  he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The top of the heap. If  anybody can solve a mystery, Christopher Cox is the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold spoke enthusiastically,  with no show of petty jealousy or envy.</p>
<p>Nor did he feel any. Cox was a  celebrated detective, Arnold not much more than a beginner.</p>
<p>Mullins, of course, was a mere  visionary, a fiction writer. Arnold, a hard worker, a plodder after the truth,  but not really brilliant.</p>
<p>While Cox, who had a wide  reputation had gained it on two continents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Sylvia want Cox?&rdquo; Billy  Trigg asked, after the group had stood in silence for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dorothy returned.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and ask her. Let&rsquo;s go back to the house anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tea was being served on the  terrace, and Mullins sat there with the three members of the family.</p>
<p>The new arrivals dropped into the  low, lounging chairs, and Bob Arnold gazed around at the peaceful scene, the  beautiful lawns and plashing fountains, the bright-hued flowers and the  tempting tea table, all in vivid contrast to the turmoil in his own heart.</p>
<p>Guy, too, looked weary and  anxious, and Bob felt a sudden resentment against the Reeds who had forced him  to have Cox enter the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard the news, Bob?&rdquo; Guy said.  &ldquo;Old Kit Cox is coming to collab with you in your work. Glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob, after a moment&rsquo;s  pause. &ldquo;Always glad to see Kit. Haven&rsquo;t laid eyes on the chap for years. You  want him, Guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Personally, I&rsquo;d  rather drop this whole terrible business. But if we must carry on, then I do  think that Cox can help us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob withdrew into himself again.  That was all these people thought of, to be helped out. Even if one of the  three were really guilty the other two would far rather hush matters up than to  have the truth come out.</p>
<p>And it was queer, but from the  trio, it was hard to say which suspected the other.</p>
<p>Sylvia had told him that she and  Guy believed Mr. Mackenzie the criminal.</p>
<p>But, and this struck Bob for the  first time, suppose Sylvia had made up that story. Suppose she had determined  to poison Fairy in the grip of an overpowering jealousy, and then had pretended  that she and Guy suspected his father.</p>
<p>Absurd? Yes, at first blush, but  the theory had its merits.</p>
<p>And maybe Sylvia had procured the  poison and then had been frustrated in her plans for administering it.</p>
<p>Well, it was a moil, and if Kit  Cox could straighten it all out, perhaps it would be better for all concerned.</p>
<p>By tacit consent, the subject was  dropped. </p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie made some casual  remark about some news of the day, and the others took cue from him.</p>
<p>Very handsome looked the master of  Warlock House, as he sat beneath the lengthening shadows on the terrace.</p>
<p>The idea of his being a murderer  was almost comic, Arnold thought, as he gazed at the man.</p>
<p>His eyes turned to Guy.</p>
<p>That too was absurd, to think of  that frank-faced, normal looking chap poisoning anybody. Yet he couldn&rsquo;t be  quite normal, or would he have fallen so suddenly and desperately in love with  an unworthy object?</p>
<p>And Sylvia? Never, never in this  world could she commit a crime. Bob knew human nature a bit too well to think  that possible.</p>
<p>He knew they were innocent, all  three. He was only considering how they might appear to the police or to  blundering detectives. Also, how they might appear to Kit Cox, who was by no  means given to blundering.</p>
<p>He wrenched his thoughts away from  these things to join in the discussion going on. It was of no moment, but it  served as distraction for the overwrought minds.</p>
<p>In fact, owing to Dorothy&rsquo;s  lightness of heart over her new hope of recovering her pearls, and Sylvia&rsquo;s  determination to keep up the casual chatter of conversation, the tea hour was  really pleasant and restful.</p>
<p>Afterward, the two girls walked in  the Italian gardens by themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry for you, Sylvia,&rdquo;  Dorothy said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said much, for I&rsquo;m not good at that sort of thing, but  I do sympathize and I do feel sure it will all turn out right yet. Egbert says  it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear little thing,&rdquo; and  Sylvia kissed her. &ldquo;Of course it will, it must all turn out right, as you put  it, but I am so full of fears and apprehensions. Oh, Dorothy, if we could just  settle it all ourselves. If Bob could decide the girl was killed by some one  from her past life, which of course she was and if the police would accept his  decision. But that old Hunter just doubts everything and everybody! I wonder  whether Mr. Cox will help or hinder our cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll help. Egbert says he&rsquo;s  a marvel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At finding out things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At finding out the truth. Sylvia,  I never altogether liked Fairy, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Dotty, you mustn&rsquo;t talk like  that against anyone who is dead. I didn&rsquo;t like her, because she was not the  sort for Guy. She was exquisitely lovely, but when you said that, you said all.  She was selfish, heartless, uncultured,&mdash;oh, lots of things. But here I am,  doing what I told you not to do, saying things against her. Well, she&rsquo;s gone,  and it&rsquo;s all terrible enough. You must go with me to the funeral tomorrow  morning, dear. Guy and his father refuse to go, though they may change their  minds over night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll go with you, of  course. Poor little Fairy. Sometimes I feel kindly toward her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll bury her properly,  and then I want to forget her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you can. I wish they&rsquo;d  drop the investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t, not if Mr. Cox comes.  You&rsquo;re largely responsible for his arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, he asked Guy to let him  come without knowing anything about my pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. I didn&rsquo;t mean to  chide you. Forgive me, Dorothy dear, if I am queer at times. All this excitement  is driving me wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy understood, and comforted  Sylvia as best she could.</p>
<p>They retraced their steps and went  back to the house to dress for dinner. As they entered, Guy came up to Sylvia  and led her aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me a few moments,&rdquo; he  said, and Sylvia obeyed.</p>
<p>He took her to the little library,  and seated her in an easy chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a word or two, Sylvia before  Cox comes. I&rsquo;m afraid of him. Afraid he&rsquo;ll suspect Dad, and then twist the  evidence to suit himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Sylvia looked aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;ll do  anything crooked. But he&rsquo;ll be so anxious to solve the mystery and so ready to  turn evidence to fit his theories, that there&rsquo;s no telling what may happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Guy, I know. What can I  do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to him, Sylvia. Talk a lot,  and try to get it into his head that Dad is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try. But if he is as  shrewd as they all say he is, he won&rsquo;t go by what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, but give it a try. And  put the best light on things. Don&rsquo;t tell him how much Dad disliked Fairy. Or how  incensed at the thought of my marrying her. If Cox digs up these things for  himself we can&rsquo;t help it. But don&rsquo;t give him a leg up if it can be avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll go further.  I&rsquo;ll&mdash;er&mdash;prevaricate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, then. If you lie to  that man he&rsquo;ll know it at once. No, you&rsquo;d better stick to the truth, but omit  anything disparaging to father, unless asked outright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Mr. Cox like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine chap. Thoroughbred,  courtly almost, and yet straightforward in his speech, too. He was the pride of  our class, and I was sorry he could not get here in time for the house party. I  didn&rsquo;t know he was coming home so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish he had been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not. If Dad did do  this thing,&mdash; you and I must be frank, Sylvia,&mdash;then Cox would have known it had  he been here. As it is, coming later, we may keep some things from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy, you don&rsquo;t feel sure that  Uncle Ralph&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, not sure. But there is  much evidence against him, if it is picked up. And, as you know, since little  Fairy&rsquo;s death, Dad has expressed himself as glad. He is willful and unwise in  his frankness, but there&rsquo;s no doing anything with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you talked with him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t talk calmly. When I  begin, he goes off his head. He is really rabid on the subject, and though sometimes  he veers round and stands up for me, mostly he berates me for ever bringing  Fairy here&mdash;and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Guy,&mdash;poor, dear Guy. Yes, of  course, I&rsquo;ll do all I can to steer Mr. Cox toward any other conclusion than a  suspicion of Uncle Ralph. When is he coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight, after dinner. Rather  late, I fancy. You see, I couldn&rsquo;t say no, when Dorothy put in a plea for her  pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll find those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sylly. All we can  do, is to sit tight, and let him gang his ain gait. Pray Heaven, Dad takes to  him, or he will be quarreling with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to try to keep Uncle in  good humor, too, then. Run and dress, Guy, it&rsquo;s nearly dinner time.&rdquo; At dinner  all were surprised at the change in Ralph Mackenzie&rsquo;s demeanor. For some  unknown reason he had become suave and docile of manner and kindly of speech.  Not that he was ever really ill tempered, that was not his way, but ever since  the tragedy, indeed, almost ever since Fairy&rsquo;s advent, he had been either  morose and taciturn or else outspokenly critical.</p>
<p>Tonight, at the head of his table,  he was the courteous host, the pleasant companion, even the good raconteur of  his former days.</p>
<p>Guy and Sylvia looked at one  another in a little perplexity, not knowing just what the change portended.</p>
<p>After dinner he requested some  music, and Sylvia sang to him and later on the men sang college songs and the  master of the house seemed to enjoy it all. And then Christopher Cox arrived.</p>
<p>He came in with a smile and a  hearty greeting. First to Ralph Mackenzie and then to Guy he extended his eager  hand, retaining his grasp of Guy&rsquo;s hand until it seemed he would never release  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear old chap!&rdquo; he exclaimed.  &ldquo;How is it that so many years have passed since we met? I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s  really you. You&rsquo;ve changed a heap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t, Kit,&rdquo; Guy responded,  smiling back at him. &ldquo;You look almost the same as you did in class. How did you  manage that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So busy, hadn&rsquo;t time to attend to  the business of growing old,&rdquo; Cox returned, gayly. &ldquo;Now, the ladies, and then  those grinning idiots behind you. I know you, Billy Trigg, funny man of the  lot,&mdash;you thought yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped his banter while he was  presented to Sylvia and to Dorothy Reed.</p>
<p>Very gracefully he made his  obeisance to them, and then with his flashing smile breaking out anew, he  turned to the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mullins! as I live! All grown up,  too. And Reed&mdash;Good Egg! And Arnold. Well, this is a reunion! Makes me forget  the years and I feel as if we were all back in the Story-Book Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cox was rather tall, very well set  up, and of easy, graceful bearing. He had dark hair and deep blue eyes, but his  chief charm lay in the lower part of his face, with its strong, firm jaw, and  well-cut mouth and ready smile.</p>
<p>There was magnetism in that smile,  and good comradeship and sympathy as well as humor.</p>
<p>There was forcefulness and  determination in the blue eyes, they looked, too, as if they could be stern and  accusing, but the genial smile made up for all. The girls were spellbound. They  were fascinated by this possessive man, who seemed to enter and then to own the  whole place.</p>
<p>Even Ralph Mackenzie gave him an  approving glance, and that assured Christopher Cox of a permanent welcome at  Warlock House. </p>

  The Quiz</b></h2>
<p>Next morning breakfast, as usual,  was an informal meal.</p>
<p>The family and the guests appeared  when they chose, but it was noticeable that they were prompt this morning.</p>
<p>Nor was it hard to guess that the  magnet drawing them was the new visitor, the engaging Christopher Cox.</p>
<p>He was like a child in his  admiration and enjoyment of the home he had invaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that  there was anything like this in this country. I&rsquo;m just back from abroad, and  while they have stately homes and all that, I saw none that combined all the  beauty of the old time architecture with the comforts and conveniences of  modern invention. Yet in no instance is there any clash or jar that mars the  harmony and symmetry of the whole make-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breakfast room windows looked  out upon a beautiful landscape, with flowers in the foreground, and picturesque  trees in the middle distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the grounds are superb,&rdquo; Cox  went on. &ldquo;The arrangement of formal gardens and the surrounding wildwood is  perfect. It is a joy to find such a home. I think I shall stay a long time  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then devoted his attention to a  selection from the dishes offered him, and seemed to enjoy his breakfast with  the same enthusiasm he showed for all things that pleased him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we all go to the funeral this  morning?&rdquo; he asked, almost as if referring to a trifling, casual matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go,&rdquo; Sylvia said, and  Dorothy Reed repeated the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mullins put in, &ldquo;I think  most of us should go. It&rsquo;s the least we can do by way of tribute to the poor  girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; Guy said,  moodily, &ldquo;but I suppose I ought to. And I hope you&rsquo;ll go, Dad. It would&mdash;er&mdash;look  better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; and they marveled  at his changed demeanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Bob Arnold thought to  himself, &ldquo;likely as not that persuasive Cox has talked to him, and made him see  straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they rose from the table, Cox  asked them to go with him out on the terrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a regular caucus,&rdquo; he said,  with his quick smile, &ldquo;but I want to get a line on the work that is ahead of  me. You see, I only just arrived from a long absence and I know little of the  facts of the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he talked he was rearranging  chairs, and motioning different ones toward them, until he had arranged the  group to his liking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me to do intelligent work as  a detective, it is necessary that I learn all you can tell me before I try to  find out things for myself. So, I hope you will not resent it, but I mean to  ask some leading questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having seated the others, he took  a chair facing them, and proceeded to light a cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the head of the house, Mr.  Mackenzie, I&rsquo;ll address you first. Who do you think put the poison in Miss  Lovell&rsquo;s glass of milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question proved Cox conversant  with the details of the actual death of the victim, and his earnestness of  manner and confidential attitude implied a sort of comradeship or bond of union  among them all.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence and  one after another looked at Ralph Mackenzie as they awaited his reply.</p>
<p>Had it been the day before, they  would have expected an outburst of exasperation from him at being questioned at  all.</p>
<p>But today they were not so much  surprised to hear him reply in quiet, even tones, that he did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;though I cannot  tell you who did do it, I can tell you who did not do it. I can swear to the  innocence of the members of my own family and the guests of my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that, I think, Mr.  Mackenzie,&rdquo; and Cox looked a little quizzical. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean you can swear  that in your opinion they are innocent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not just the same. But I am  glad to hear such a whole-hearted assertion. Now just one or two points more.  Are you a sound sleeper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am a very sound sleeper.  But I refer to noises in general about the house. They would not awaken me.  However, if anyone entered my room, I should wake in an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Now, Mr. Mackenzie, if  your belief in the innocence of your friends is well founded, we must assume  that some one else, say somebody from outside this place, must have come to the  Gerson cottage that night, must have effected an entrance and must have put the  poison in the milk. These statements are undeniable. Now, I take it, you heard  no sound indicative of such an intruder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not. Yet, I am certain  that is what happened. The fact that I did not hear anybody does not mean  nobody came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. And you include  your servants in your bill of exoneration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. It would be absurd to  suspect them. Few of them knew Miss Lovell at all, and those who did admired  her very much. Moreover, they are one and all devoted to my son, and would not  harm a lady he loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally not.&rdquo; Cox smiled in  full accord. &ldquo;Now, in assuming this hypothetical outsider, we must remember the  packets of poison found in your room and in Miss Field&rsquo;s room. It would  scarcely be possible for this intruder to have placed those where they were  later found, at the time he came to poison the milk. Granted that the poison  packets were placed in order to throw suspicion on you or on Miss Field or  both, they must have been put in place before. For you assure me that though  you may sleep through outside noises, if anyone entered your room you would  waken at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is so. I see where you  are leading, and it does seem as if the planting of those two packets indicates  some one with access to the Gerson cottage at all times. This would seem to  contradict the theory of a marauder from the city or elsewhere. Yet, I still  firmly believe that the murderer came from outside and that he was some person  so connected with Miss Lovell&rsquo;s past life as to wish to bring about her death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have had an accomplice  among your staff of servants who would place the packets for him,&rdquo; Cox  suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a thing is possible. There  are many servants, and many who never come into the living rooms. Some such  one, not knowing Miss Lovell, scarcely knowing my son, might have been bribed  to do that errand for the chief villain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a possibility,&rdquo; Cox said,  and then he turned to Guy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, old chap,&rdquo; and his smile  was more than ever winning, &ldquo;but it seems necessary to put this same question  to you. Who, in your opinion, killed Miss Lovell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy turned a shade paler but he  sat still and spoke steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kit, I can only echo my father&rsquo;s  words. I know of no one who would kill that beautiful girl. I know of no reason  why she should be killed. Like my father I am sure it was some one we do not  know and never heard of. Some one from outside who had some old-time grudge  against her, perhaps only a fancied grudge. Or perhaps a disappointed lover,  who felt he would rather see her dead than the bride of another man. This is,  of course, mere surmise, but in the absence of definite evidence or direct  clues, what else can we find to work on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want Miss Lovell&rsquo;s death  avenged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy looked at the speaker with sad  eyes, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I do. She seems  to have no relatives who clamor for vengeance, no people to look after her, no  property to be disposed of, and as to her memory, it may be wisest and best to  let it go without further molestation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy talked in a low, clear voice,  and held himself well in hand, but it was easily seen that he was nervously  perturbed.</p>
<p>Some of his listeners felt sure  that he already knew something to Fairy&rsquo;s discredit in her past, which if  brought out by an investigation would be detrimental to her memory and by  reflection, also to the Mackenzie family.</p>
<p>Bob Arnold felt that Guy put  consideration of the girl first, but he knew that thought of the elder  Mackenzie&rsquo;s feelings also loomed high in the son&rsquo;s mental processes.</p>
<p>Arnold, himself, thoroughly agreed  with the theory held by Guy and his father. For Bob didn&rsquo;t believe that they or  Sylvia did the awful deed, and he had no reason to suspect any of the servants.</p>
<p>This left only the supposititious  intruder, whose motive must hark back to the unknown past of the beautiful  Fairy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get your point, Guy,&rdquo; Cox was  saying, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t do to hush the matter up without due and  proper effort to learn the truth. You have nothing to fear but a possible  exposure of something derogatory to the girl. And while that would be  undesirable and unpleasant it would be better than to let a murderer go free.  There can be no doubt that it was murder, and premeditated, too. Somebody  wanted that girl removed, and somebody saw to it that she was. It is for us to  learn that somebody&rsquo;s identity. This I propose to do, and I am not shirking my  work or asking undue assistance, but I do want the opinion of you all. Miss  Field, will you tell me your idea of the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same as Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s and  Guy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Sylvia said, turning her calm eyes on Cox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, too, believe in this  intruder, this stealthy prowler who came into the bungalow and poisoned the  milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. What else is  there to believe in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you heard him come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Sylvia&rsquo;s  startled eyes fell before Cox&rsquo;s look of doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how could you help it? You  were on the same side of the house, your room was next to Miss Lovell&rsquo;s,  everything was quiet, how could you help hearing the advent of the poisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was asleep,&rdquo; Sylvia  returned, looking worried. &ldquo;That is, I must have been. Also, I suppose that,  naturally, he would enter noiselessly and having accomplished his errand, go  away at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think then, that Miss Lovell  was asleep too, when he came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. If not, she would  have raised the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if she were asleep, she would  have already taken her milk. We can&rsquo;t assume the murderer brought milk with  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have gone to sleep  without drinking it. Then waked up later and drank it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, but it is usually  the practice of those who take such draughts to swallow them the last thing  before going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m  sure,&rdquo; and Sylvia leaned back in her chair as if the matter were ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too, whoever it was, must have  known of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s habit of having milk at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; and Sylvia&rsquo;s  voice was uninterested and non-committal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And must have been sufficiently  at home in the cottage to get in beforehand and leave the incriminating parcels  of poison where they would serve as clues. Or could that have been done some  time before? Could they have been planted, say, before the house party arrived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; Sylvia returned.  She was getting restless, for she didn&rsquo;t quite know whither these queries were  tending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you move over to the  cottage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly move. The guests  began to arrive Friday afternoon. My maid carried my things over there Friday  morning. Had there been any suspicious looking parcel there then, she would  have noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s  togs were sent over about the same time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ralph Mackenzie,  curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, then,&rdquo; and Cox smiled  once more. &ldquo;Now, Mullins, your opinion ought to be of interest, these things  being in your line of thought. Who poisoned the milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mullins, catching the hint of a  lighter note, played up to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my line is pure imagination.  Shall I carry that into a discussion of facts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detective work is half fact and  half imagination,&rdquo; Cox returned, seriously. &ldquo;So out with your ideas, fact or  fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll say it was the man with  the hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; and Cox looked puzzled.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a new one to me. Is he pure fiction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Mullins looked uncertain  as to how to proceed. &ldquo;You see, I really did see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his hat? Is that important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because nobody in the crowd  here would put on a hat to cross the lawn on a short errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About midnight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no. More like three a.m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sounds intriguing. Here, we  perhaps have the intruder from outside. He wasn&rsquo;t carrying a few packets of  powder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I noticed, nor yet, a  bottle of milk. Though it would seem Miss Lovell would have finished hers by  that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mull, you&rsquo;re sure about this  man? Not inventing him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Kit, not romancing at all. I  certainly saw him, but vaguely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why vaguely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was sleepy myself, and  just about to turn in. Because it is a goodish distance to see clearly,&mdash;across  the wide lawns. Because, it being none of my business I had no special interest  in a man walking about. For aught I knew he belonged in the house. Remember  there was no cause for observation, no thought of clue or evidence, no reason  for suspicion of any sort. I knew some of the family lodged temporarily in that  bungalow, but I knew nothing of the regular residents there and this might have  been one of them coming home late&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you saw him go away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. Maybe five, or ten  minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you knew he wasn&rsquo;t one of  the residents of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I gave it no thought. Had I  been asked to do so, I could have thought up a dozen good reasons for his  movements, but nobody asked me to, and I paid no attention to it all.  Afterward, I chanced to remember it, but I&rsquo;ve told you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy, pitch in and tell me  something,&rdquo; begged Cox of Trigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know a thing,&rdquo; declared  Billy. &ldquo;I think, with the most of us, there&rsquo;s no way to look but for this  mysterious prowler. Mullins&rsquo; man, doubtless, who came up from the past, sought  revenge for some real or fancied wrong, and then went back to his oblivion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here. I&rsquo;m no detective, I  don&rsquo;t know anything about clues and things, but I do say there&rsquo;s no other  possible solution but that revengeful villain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Egbert Reed considered. Then he  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came over from New York in his  car. Parked it far enough away not to have his arrival heard. Picked it up  again when he went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Egg!&rdquo; cried Cox. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just what he did do.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; said Bob,  staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know everything?&rdquo; said  Kit, airily. &ldquo;Mrs. Dorothy, what about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always agree with Egbert,&rdquo; she  said, demurely. &ldquo;And did that prowler man take my pearls on Sunday? Was that  the day he came up ahead to plant his parcels of powder, and he visited my  room, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. And then, maybe he didn&rsquo;t  go back to town, just stayed over for the night performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiding around in the shrubbery  for twelve hours, more or less!&rdquo; exclaimed Mullins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Cox. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why  he wanted a hat, you see. It might have rained. Well, Bob, that does us all up.  I can&rsquo;t consistently ask you questions, for you are on the job yourself.  Moreover, you weren&rsquo;t here when the thing happened. If you care to, you might  tell us in which direction your investigations have led.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly tell you anything  I&rsquo;ve found out. It&rsquo;s no secret. But I haven&rsquo;t learned anything for sure. I  believe that your theories about that intruder are all to the good. I believe  he did come here from New York or some other place, and that it was because of  some past trouble or love affair he had had with the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as a detective, how do you  explain the packets of powder planted in two rooms of the cottage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain that. To me that  is the most mysterious thing of all. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest glimmering of an  idea how that powder got into the two rooms where it didn&rsquo;t belong. I can  surmise it was put there to incriminate the two who occupied those rooms, but  how or when or by whom it was put there, I can&rsquo;t even imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s attitude was quite different  from that of Cox.</p>
<p>Cox was jaunty and debonair,  though serious and earnest, too. While Bob was sad, almost despairing of  demeanor. He seemed to feel as if he had failed, as if he had not done what Guy  expected of him.</p>
<p>Yet he was in no way jealous or  resentful of Kit Cox&rsquo;s presence and he hung on the words of the greater  detective as if trying to read his innermost thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cox said, slowly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  imagine, either. Yet it proves, apparently, the presence of the murderer here  before the actual crime. That is, unless he had the bravado to put the packets  in place that night after poisoning the milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have heard him if he had  entered my room,&rdquo; declared Sylvia, positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Mackenzie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time did you drink your  milk, Mr. Mackenzie?&rdquo; asked Cox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until toward morning. We had  a feast late, just before retiring, and I was not avid for the milk. But I woke  up about daybreak, and I drank it then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And you slept soundly from  the time you first went to sleep until you woke at dawn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so sure there  was no stranger in my room that night. Had there been I should have heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t make it plausible  that the criminal visited your two rooms after he was in Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor before, on that trip,&rdquo; put in  Bob, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor before on that trip,&rdquo; Cox  repeated. &ldquo;When, then, did he do it? For it was done, and done with malice  aforethought. What are the packets like? As if a chemist had wrapped them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sylvia said. &ldquo;Not at all  like that. More as if the trembling fingers of a frightened person had tied  them up. They were irregularly folded, the paper was crumpled and a little  soiled, and the string was clumsily knotted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Miss Field!&rdquo; and Cox  looked at her admiringly. &ldquo;I can see them clearly from your graphic  description. And how much did each hold? Say, half a teaspoonful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that, or a trifle more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to my mind, those papers  most certainly are the keynote of the whole mystery. Find out who could have  placed them and you have your criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Bob, but so  solemnly that they all stared at him. &ldquo;Now how to find that out? Can you do it,  Coxy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I can find out  anything. And then, Bob, will the matter of the murder link up with the  question of the pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; Bob returned,  still with that grave look and sad expression of countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, we must go to the  funeral, those of us who are going,&rdquo; Cox said, rising.</p>
<p>The others rose too, and though  several of them were much averse to going, they felt it was best for Guy&rsquo;s  interests that they should do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s the only show of respect  we can make toward the little girl he loved,&rdquo; said Dorothy, as she and her  husband started for their rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the past tense?&rdquo; Cox asked  her in a low tone, for they stood a little apart from the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t think he still loves  her,&rdquo; Dorothy returned. &ldquo;He found out a lot of things about her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to her credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I have still much to learn.  But when we return from the church, I will get really busy. You&rsquo;ll help me,  Mrs. Reed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she smiled and  dimpled. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to find my pearls for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, you little <i>quid pro quo!</i> But you ought to say you&rsquo;d  help me without reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, if you find the pearls,&rdquo;  and Dorothy ran away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know a bit or two, Bob,&rdquo; Cox  said, as they two were the only ones left of the scattering group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much, Kit, but all I know  is yours. We must have a confab soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you know you&rsquo;ll tell me,  Bobby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, why not? Are you afraid  I&rsquo;ll ask you to reciprocate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it isn&rsquo;t that, my boy. I  only wondered if you had knowledge that you thought you ought not to reveal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing like that, Kit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have our confab. And  then I must see the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police! They&rsquo;ll hang you at the  yardarm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em. But I can&rsquo;t go into this  thing without learning all they can tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll tell you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have to tell, I&rsquo;ll  gather it from them as I go along. Like a bee gathering honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they won&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know them. You&rsquo;re a  smart one, Kit, I know, but Baird and Hunter are a strong team, and they&rsquo;ll put  it over on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, they suspect Mr. Mackenzie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or Guy, or both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Sylvia, or any two or all  three?&rdquo; put in Cox.</p>
<p>And Bob said, soberly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Reporter</b></h2>
<p>At luncheon that day, Christopher  Cox was so pleasantly entertaining that the gloom engendered by the funeral  services was slowly but surely dispelled.</p>
<p>Not that Cox was of the funny man  type, that was Billy Trigg&rsquo;s role, though he had neglected it of late.</p>
<p>But Cox had the magnetic  personality which draws others to follow his lead and he avoided all reference  to the tragedy and to the sad rites they had just witnessed, and introduced  other subjects and drew out interested comment, until the conversation became  general and animated.</p>
<p>That is, among the guests.</p>
<p>Ralph Mackenzie was silent, though  making a showing of polite interest in the talk.</p>
<p>Sylvia was palpably suppressing  her feelings and bravely struggling to act as usual; while Guy, with white,  strained face made no effort to hide his grief.</p>
<p>But the other guests rallied round  Cox, and ably assisted him in his endeavors to create a brighter atmosphere.</p>
<p>Luncheon over, Ralph Mackenzie  disappeared and Guy, with a sigh, took up the business of being host.</p>
<p>The Reeds and Billy Trigg and Bob  Arnold made it as easy as they could for him, and managed to take him out of  himself a little.</p>
<p>Cox, with a whispered invitation  to Sylvia, led her away across the lawns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Field,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  marked time long enough. I purposely evaded the subject at the luncheon table,  for nothing can be gained by general conversation. But if I&rsquo;m to clear up this  affair, and exonerate you three people, my work must begin at once. And I must  have one of you three to help me. You didn&rsquo;t poison Miss Lovell&rsquo;s glass of  milk, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sylvia, simply, showing  no resentment at the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought not. So, I&rsquo;ll ask you  to be my assistant in clearing the other two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did do it, Mr. Cox?&rdquo; the girl  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, yet. But surely it  can&rsquo;t be a hard matter to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hard! It looks to me  impossible. Why haven&rsquo;t the police made any headway? Why hasn&rsquo;t Bob Arnold done  anything? Why is suspicion still hanging over us three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To answer categorically, the  police are doubtless working as hard as they can. Arnold is handicapped by  circumstances. And suspicion hovers over you three because you three had motive  and opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia thought this over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we did. Though,  what could be Guy&rsquo;s motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that he had learned such  grave things to the girl&rsquo;s discredit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t learn those things  until after she was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he said. But it may be that he  prevaricated. Don&rsquo;t think for a minute I&rsquo;m accusing Guy; I know he didn&rsquo;t kill  her, but I always consider what others may assume or theorize. And as the most  interested person, Guy will come in for his share of suspicion. You heard their  last interview, that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is, I heard Guy talking  to her, but I didn&rsquo;t hear what they said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so late that Fairy refused  him admittance, but he begged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begged or commanded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia looked astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; she said,  wonderingly. &ldquo;Yes, he commanded her to let him in. I heard him almost shout,  &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t open this window, I&rsquo;ll break it in!&rsquo; and then Fairy unfastened  the chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was something like  that. But you saw and heard Fairy about after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. It wasn&rsquo;t a quarrel, you  know, only Guy was possessed to get in, and Fairy, quite rightly, tried to keep  him out, as it was so late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and remember I don&rsquo;t  suspect Guy, but you can see for yourself, that, if so minded, he could have  put the poison in the milk then. Anybody could manage a trick like that. I  assume she had not yet drunk the milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. She liked to sip it  after she was in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, there you are. You and I  don&rsquo;t believe this was the way it happened, but I want you to realize that if  the police suspect Guy, they have a plausible story to back up their theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not plausible,&rdquo; Sylvia objected,  &ldquo;for Guy loved her too well to do her any harm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Cox&rsquo;s voice was  patient, &ldquo;but if he had learned of her falsity and worthlessness, his love  could have turned to hate on the instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course that could be. But as  you say you don&rsquo;t believe Guy guilty, there&rsquo;s no use of our discussing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m making a point of it  because I want you to understand that there is need for us to bestir ourselves  to prove his innocence and his father&rsquo;s as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; Sylvia said, speaking  seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if the police or anyone  else really suspect you. They might claim you were jealous of Guy&rsquo;s new  sweetheart, but no one could predicate murder from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Sylvia smiled sadly. &ldquo;My  only wish was for Guy&rsquo;s happiness. And if his happiness meant possession of  that lovely child, then I was ready to do anything I could to help, not to  hinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew that. Now, on the  other hand, Guy&rsquo;s father wanted to hinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, but not to the extent of  murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that because the wish is  father to the thought. You don&rsquo;t know the depths of evil in the heart of any  man. Moreover, Mr. Mackenzie may have thought it no evil to remove such a  menace to his son&rsquo;s life. He knew she was no fit wife for Guy, he knew that  very shortly Guy would tire of the girl, or worse, would come to hate her for  the life she would lead him. You don&rsquo;t know, nobody here knows the depths of  wrong doing in that girl&rsquo;s past. But there&rsquo;s no need to dwell on that, it would  not help any in the investigation as I shall conduct it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of success, Mr. Cox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. I have never failed yet in  solving a mystery. I say this without conceit, without vainglory, for to my  mind, any crime committed by man, may be discovered by man. With common sense  and a bit of intuitive perception, motives may be laid bare and criminals  exposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So quiet was Cox&rsquo;s manner and so  practical his voice that he gave no effect of vanity or self-esteem. He was  like an expert who knew his own powers from experience and was fully prepared  to bank on them against all comers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you see  how matters stand, and you can no longer wonder why I selected you for my  assistant and my confidant. Arnold is all right, but he doesn&rsquo;t know the family  as you do, and, too, he doesn&rsquo;t know the little girl. Did you greatly admire  her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though asked as carelessly as his  other questions, Cox waited eagerly for the reply to this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admired her, unwillingly,&rdquo; said  Sylvia, slowly. &ldquo;You seem to impel my confidence, so I don&rsquo;t mind saying to you  that I am very fond of Guy.&rdquo; She said this with the utmost simplicity, as if  slating a self-evident fact. &ldquo;But more than all else, I desire his happiness. I  waited eagerly the advent of this paragon of his, prepared to love her for his  sake. But, her appearance and manner disappointed me. She was beautiful beyond  all words. Nobody could deny that. But she was&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard to pick the right  word,&mdash;she was not quite to the manner born. She was too breezy, too careless of  speech and gesture, too ready to chaff, and she suggested publicity and  limelight and all that sort of thing, though of course we had then no inkling  of her being a professional dancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had some good traits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a loving, gentle nature, and  a willingness to oblige,&mdash;if it did not interfere with her own personal comfort.  That doesn&rsquo;t sound much, but her disposition was really lovely&mdash;or, seemed so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have been acting a part,  but we will give her credit for those things. Now, Miss Field, will you take me  to see her room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. The police have  the key, I suppose, but Mrs. Gerson has another key, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will save trouble then. And  don&rsquo;t think we are doing wrong in using it. The police would give me their key,  on request. But it will save time for me to see the room, before I interview  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on to the bungalow,  and Mrs. Gerson, at Sylvia&rsquo;s request, produced the key.</p>
<p>The two entered, and Cox closed  the door behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose everything is practically  untouched,&rdquo; he said, as he gave a preliminary glance around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; Sylvia returned. &ldquo;It  has been kept locked&mdash;why, no, some one has been in here! See, the wardrobe door  is open, and the things are tumbled about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. Obviously somebody had  been searching in the wardrobe. The carefully trained Jenny had always kept the  dresses properly on hangers, the hats on their small stands, and the shoes on  their trees.</p>
<p>Now, the dresses were tumbled in a  heap on the wardrobe floor, the hats were off their stands and the shoes had  been removed from the shoe trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has been searching for  something,&rdquo; said Cox, quickly. &ldquo;Now, what did that girl have of value?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively nothing,&rdquo; said Sylvia.  &ldquo;She had no jewelry outside of a few trumpery imitations, except the diamonds  Guy had given her. And those are now in his keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the search was for some  paper or letter or something vital to her fortune or reputation. What about her  letters? Were they not indicative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She left no letters that we found,  except one she wrote herself. The police have that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was it discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her blotting book,&mdash;not hers,  but one that was on the table. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know in which leaf it was  found?&rdquo; said Cox as he scrutinized the blank pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sylvia, but she turned  red and then pale, a fact that Cox did not fail to notice, though he gave no  sign of having done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of this note. To some  unknown, and rather cryptic, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvia, faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember its contents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was  no name at the beginning, and the text ran to the effect that the threats of  the person addressed had no weight with her whatever. And another sentence said  that the snowdrops were healed, and there the writing ceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if she had been interrupted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or had decided not to finish  the letter. She was like that. Often she would change her mind most suddenly.  Perhaps she&rsquo;d be half dressed in one costume, and then have a whim to change to  another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Cox was still  scrutinizing the blank pages of the blotting book, as if he could read from its  very blankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This letter was dated?&rdquo; he said,  after a pause. Again Sylvia turned rosy pink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a date, merely Monday, 7:30  a.m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the girl was dead by that  time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes,&rdquo; and Sylvia was so  nervously embarrassed that Cox was sorry for her.</p>
<p>He pointed to a page in the new  blotting book which showed on its fair whiteness a tiny line of ink, as if made  by blotting a light scratch of a pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Field,&rdquo; he said, in the  kindest possible tone, &ldquo;why did you alter that one-thirty to seven-thirty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; and Sylvia  became haughty at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; and he gave her  a quizzical smile that reassured her a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I have  seen that letter. I haven&rsquo;t yet met the policemen who are on this job, but I  did stop in to look over the few bits of evidence they have collected, and I  especially noticed the letter. It had a tiny top to the seven, that was  palpably not written by the hand that dated the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, because the top of the  seven was lighter colored than the rest of the figure. That is accounted for by  the fact that the top was blotted,&mdash;here,&mdash; while the upright was not blotted at  all. Also, the top of the seven was quite evidently put on later, for it was at  a different angle from the writing, and showed a joining, which would not occur  in a seven made at one stroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a magician,&rdquo; she said,  quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you imagine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want imagination, I want  you to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will. I committed no crime.  I was in here alone, it was only a short time after we learned of her death. I  looked about to note any evidences and I found the letter in the blotting  book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see now it was an insane  impulse, but I was harassed by the fear they might suspect Guy, because I had&mdash;I  had heard him over here so late,&mdash; and thinking to make it appear that she was  alive at seven-thirty, I added the little mark to the one, and clapped the book  shut. I didn&rsquo;t think the matter out, that they would know the hour she died and  all that, I acted on a half-crazed impulse, and I hope it will do no real  harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has puzzled the authorities,  for they know the girl was dead by four o&rsquo;clock at latest, but, no, I can&rsquo;t see  that it has done any real harm, though certainly it has done no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; said Sylvia,  contritely. &ldquo;Must it be made known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t say yet. But if we  can keep it to ourselves, we will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled so kindly that Sylvia  was lifted from her slough of despond and she smiled with him.</p>
<p>After all, she had meant no harm  and Cox was quick to see that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;have you anything else to confess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, Sylvia&rsquo;s quick blush gave  an affirmative answer, which her words contradicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, a little  defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Christopher Cox said to  himself, but aloud he spoke no word.</p>
<p>He stood for a time in front of  the open wardrobe, scrutinizing the untidy array of clothing. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last time you were here these  things were in order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Sylvia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has access to this room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the police and Mrs. Gerson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have done this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. She is the soul of  neatness and tidiness, and, too, she&rsquo;d have no reason to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nor would the police hunt for  anything and leave the place in such disorder. There must have been an  outsider, who made an entrance,&mdash;yet none of the windows is forced, so, he  entered by the door. And, as the lock isn&rsquo;t broken, he entered with a key.  Therefore, somebody let him in. There is a traitor in the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless he had a duplicate key  made,&rdquo; suggested Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever girl. That&rsquo;s a point well  taken. But we&rsquo;ll see about that later. Who remained in this house while we went  to the funeral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Jenny, my maid. The Gersons  wanted to go to the church, but Jenny is of a nervous temperament and preferred  to stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you summon Jenny, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Christopher Cox gave an  explicit order, the smile faded from his face, and his pleasant countenance  gave way to a grim inscrutability.</p>
<p>Sylvia again felt a shudder of  fear, as she went to the door and called Abbie Gerson.</p>
<p>She sent her to find Jenny and  bring her back with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suspect Jenny of&mdash;of  anything wrong?&rdquo; she asked, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Jenny,&rdquo; Cox replied,  and his manner was gentle again.</p>
<p>In a few moments Jenny appeared,  obviously ill at ease.</p>
<p>Christopher Cox looked at her. His  scrutiny was so prolonged that Jenny became nervous, which, indeed, was the  detective&rsquo;s amiable intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I speak to Miss Sylvia alone,  please?&rdquo; the maid said, with a futile attempt to speak pertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jenny,&rdquo; Cox returned, &ldquo;by no  means. You will tell Miss Field and myself who it was that you let in here this  morning, and why he left the room in such disorder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t let anybody in, sir.&rdquo;  Jenny was on the verge of tears, if not of a nervous collapse, and Cox hastened  to reassure her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jenny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have,  I am sure, nothing to fear if you tell the truth. And you&rsquo;re in for a jolly  hard time if you don&rsquo;t! Also, I am a person who cannot be fooled. If you tell  the truth, I shall know it. And if you don&rsquo;t I shall know it, too, and I shall  see that you are duly punished. Now, who came while we were all at the  funeral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Terrill, sir,&rdquo; and Jenny  resigned herself to obey orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Mr. Terrill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the reporter on a New York  paper. He wanted to see Miss Fairy&rsquo;s wardrobe.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you had no business to show  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not, sir,&rdquo; Jenny  sighed. &ldquo;But he was so pleasant-spoken and he said it meant everything to him  to get a good story for his paper. He said if he didn&rsquo;t get the story, he&rsquo;d  lose his job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he told you what a pretty  girl you are, and how much he likes you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; agreed Jenny,  innocently. &ldquo;And he said it would harm nobody and might do a deal of good, if  he could just get a list of her clothes. Though how that could be, I don&rsquo;t  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Cox. &ldquo;Go on, Jenny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he coaxed and he wheedled  till he made me believe there was no harm in it, and I got Mrs. Gerson&rsquo;s key, I  know where she keeps it, and I let him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you go in, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jenny, looking  embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Cox, with quick  intuition, &ldquo;you stayed out on the porch, to warn him if the people appeared  coming back from the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Jenny, who was  candor itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long was he in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter of a half hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took him all that time to make a  list of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s clothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, sir. I didn&rsquo;t think  much about him. I supposed a reporter had a right to rummage about, and I&rsquo;d no  idea he left the room like this or I&rsquo;d a tidied it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come in here after he  went away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. He came out with the key  in his hand and gave it to me and I put it back where it belonged. That&rsquo;s all,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And enough. Did he carry anything  away with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did. A pair of Miss Lovell&rsquo;s  shoes. I said, &lsquo;What you got there?&rsquo; and he said, sorta pathetic like, &lsquo;A pair of  the little girl&rsquo;s shoes. For a souvenir. I used to know her.&rsquo; Well, sir, what&rsquo;s  a pair of shoes? And nobody could wear Miss Fairy&rsquo;s tiny slippers, anyhow. So I  let him take &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he soft soaped you some  more, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. He was a blarney, that  chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jenny, you&rsquo;d recognize him  if you ever should see him again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I would. I&rsquo;d never forget  his black, curly hair and his black eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially his eyes. Great for  admiring glances, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a character, that maid of  yours,&rdquo; Cox said, as Jenny went off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Sylvia. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t  understand it at all. Jenny is like that; she&rsquo;s a splendid servant, but she&rsquo;s a  little lacking in plain common sense. If anybody flatters her, she would do  whatever she was bid. I&rsquo;m not surprised that she let the man in, but what did  he want? What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, yet, but I shall  find out. I thought at first he was looking for a paper or a letter. But I&rsquo;ve  changed my mind. You see, he took away a pair of shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a souvenir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Now, you know the man who  was prowling in this room Monday night took away a pair of shoes,&mdash;at least Bob  Arnold says he felt them in the chap&rsquo;s pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this can&rsquo;t be the same man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it can. It must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is Terrill. I know  Terrill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he interviewed me about  Fairy&rsquo;s death. He was much interested in the letter she left in the blotting  book&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told him about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then he wanted to see in  her room. But the police had the key so he couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he came back late that  night and broke into the room, and went away with one pair of shoes. And today  he comes back and gets another pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is if he is the same  man Bob saw. But why would one man want two pairs of her shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would two men want them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As souvenirs, of course. I  suppose as a professional dancer, Fairy had many admirers. And some people  collect dancers&rsquo; shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cox agreed, &ldquo;some people do  collect dancers&rsquo; shoes!&rdquo; </p>

  The Husband</b></h2>
<p>Leaving Sylvia, Cox went straight  down to the village of Penrose and visited the police.</p>
<p>At first Hunter resented his  presence on the case, but Christopher Cox with his marvelous tact and  diplomacy, soon won over the police detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Hunter,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve done so much, and made such good headway, it&rsquo;s a pleasure for me to  come in with you. For, being right on the spot at Warlock House, I can get some  points that you can&rsquo;t, and I propose we tell one another all our findings and  work together. I&rsquo;m not one of those chaps who keep all they learn secret. I  prefer to mull over the matter with you and between us we may get at the  truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly mollified was Hunter at  this sort of talk, but he still hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector Baird and I, we think  we have the truth,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;we have no doubt now, that Mr. Guy  Mackenzie killed the lady, himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cox betrayed no surprise or  disagreement with this opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I  daresay you have unearthed some further evidence to feel so sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baird fidgetted a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Hunter puts that too  positively,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We do think it the only way to look, but I can hardly  say we are sure as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, it needs a lot  of proof,&rdquo; Cox said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;to assert such an unlikely thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so unlikely,&rdquo; Hunter  interposed. &ldquo;Many a man has killed his sweetheart before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; and Cox nodded in  agreement. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s sum up a little. We have three suspects, &mdash;for I haven&rsquo;t  heard anyone else mentioned by name except the three members of the family. All  three had motive and opportunity. So, much must depend on their alibis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not one has an alibi,&rdquo;  exclaimed Hunter, triumphantly. &ldquo;I mean, not one of them can bring proof that  he or she didn&rsquo;t go to Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room late that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hardest alibi to prove,&rdquo;  said Cox, musingly, &ldquo;that one was in bed and asleep at any given time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; said Hunter.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far easier to prove that one wasn&rsquo;t. Now, I hold that the man Mr. Mullins  saw at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, was Mr. Guy Mackenzie, going over from the  big house to the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a hat on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that hat business is all  foolishness. He was dressed; probably the crowd of young men had just broken up  and started off to bed, and as he went through the hall he picked up his hat  from the hat-rack and put it on without thinking anything about it. A most  natural thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, except for the fact that in  that house there is no hall hatrack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do the men hang their hats,  then?&rdquo; demanded Hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a coat room, off the main  hall. It is, perhaps, a minor point, but to get a hat, Guy Mackenzie would have  had to go to the coat room, or up to his own rooms. He couldn&rsquo;t do either of  those things, unthinkingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he may have wanted to  wear a hat. The night air&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night air fiddlesticks! Guy never  wears a hat if he can avoid it. He goes about hatless, always, except when he  leaves the premises. Mullins&rsquo; man was not Guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was Guy&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; Baird  said, decidedly. &ldquo;He would wear a hat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Good Lord, man, he was in  the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but he went out say,  at his window, and in at Miss Lovell&rsquo;s window. They&rsquo;re on the same porch. He  couldn&rsquo;t go across the hall, inside the house, for he would be heard. So he  stepped out on the verandah, and so entered Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she let him in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. She would let him in if he  seemed to have some especial reason to want to talk to her. He could make up  some plausible reason, and then he could easily find an opportunity to slip the  powder in the milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your theory is ingenious,&rdquo; Cox  conceded, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Hunter sighed. &ldquo;But  we&rsquo;ll get proof. It has to be, it <i>must</i> be one of those two men. But whichever  it was, the other knows it and won&rsquo;t tell. In fact, I think Miss Field knows,  too, but the three stand by one another, and there&rsquo;s no getting anything out of  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the stolen pearls?&rdquo;  Cox asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on that, too. But I  think the two cases have no connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they have,&rdquo; Cox said,  pleasantly. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t enough data as yet to accuse anybody. You see, I&rsquo;m  just beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His winning smile disarmed any  annoyance they might have felt at his contradiction of their theories, and  Hunter said, a little patronizingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. When you&rsquo;ve gone  further you&rsquo;ll see things as we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Cox returned. &ldquo;But  doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you that the past life of Miss Lovell ought to be more fully  looked into? May she not have had a lover who was so jealous of her, that her  engagement to Guy Mackenzie wrought him up to such a desperate pitch, that he  came up here and killed her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came up that Sunday night, you  mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And put poison in her glass of  milk, and then put the bogus packets in the rooms of Miss Field and Mr.  Mackenzie? Oh, Mr. Cox, we&rsquo;re not oblivious to the definite evidence, though  there&rsquo;s precious little of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet a jealous lover could have  done all of that. If clever enough to plan such a deed, he could be clever  enough to implicate the other occupants of the cottage. And, that night,  everybody was tired out and was sleeping soundly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Lovell let this man in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she would, for she would be  afraid to do otherwise. And, too, they may have been married&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have reason to think Miss  Lovell had been married. You see, she was older than was supposed by the people  up here. Older, and far less innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was about as bad as they  come,&rdquo; said Baird, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was that,&rdquo; Cox agreed, with  equal seriousness. &ldquo;So, is it not logical to look for some episode in her past  that would bring about the tragedy, rather than to suspect people against whom  you have no proof whatever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we have been hasty,&rdquo;  Baird admitted. &ldquo;You know she was or had been married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s all I do know  about it. Six years ago, she had a husband. Then, after a time, the husband was  not in evidence. What became of him I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe they were divorced.  But, I do think, these things should be looked into before you accuse the  Mackenzies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Mr. Cox,&rdquo; Baird  declared. &ldquo;I quite agree with you, and I shall set machinery in motion to  investigate her past life. The man with the hat, may have been somebody from  the city, who wished her dead. She must have had many affairs more or less  unsavory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. Well, Mr. Baird,  go ahead with your investigations and I&rsquo;ll go ahead with mine. We&rsquo;ll have  another conference when we have more evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christopher Cox walked away,  thinking deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to do it,&rdquo; he said, to  himself. &ldquo;I had to get them off the Mackenzies&rsquo; trail, and how else could I  manage it? And she was married, that I know. Wonder what became of her husband.  I don&rsquo;t even know his name. But if he was still her husband, it isn&rsquo;t  surprising he marched himself up here to kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he neared the house. Cox met  Sylvia walking with Billy Trigg.</p>
<p>They were absorbed in  conversation, but looked pleased at sight of the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are things going, Kit?&rdquo; asked  Trigg. &ldquo;Can you clear old Guy and his Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must!&rdquo; broke in Sylvia.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re here for, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Cox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very lovely Sylvia looked, in her  correct sports suit, and Billy Trigg gazed at her adoringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to wonder what I am here  for,&rdquo; Cox said, lightly. &ldquo;Is it to get at the truth or to free everybody from  suspicion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Sylvia cried, &ldquo;free  everybody and then the case must drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any real suspect, Kit?&rdquo;  Trigg inquired, seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a real one, but one or two  imaginary persons are under grave suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man with the hat?&rdquo; Trigg  suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cox agreed, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo; Sylvia asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy Lovell&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; came in a shocked voice,  and Bob Arnold joined the group just in time to hear Cox&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she married?&rdquo; and Sylvia  spoke in a low, scared voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush up, Kit!&rdquo; Bob urged.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bring that out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this. I&rsquo;ve been talking with  Guy, and he&rsquo;s so broken up over the harsh things said about Fairy, he&rsquo;s nearly  crazy. He told me if anything further came out against her, he should clear  out, he simply couldn&rsquo;t stand it. I daresay she was married, but need it be  exploited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose her husband was her  murderer?&rdquo; Cox said, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he was,&rdquo; retorted Bob,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather he&rsquo;d get off scot free, than have Guy know of his existence. There  are other things yet to be divulged about Fairy, and Guy will have all he can  bear, without that added horror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it can be proved that the  husband person, or a lover, came and poisoned Fairy, then that automatically clears  all suspected here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it will send Guy to the  madhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Bob, people don&rsquo;t  really go mad, you know, they only threaten it. It would be far better for Guy  to have a terrific shock that would dash his idol from her pedestal, than to go  on as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Billy, you and  Sylvia run along and flirt. I want to talk to Kit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair strolled off, obediently,  and Bob said: &ldquo;Come into this arbor, Kit, and let&rsquo;s have it out.&rdquo; The two men  sat down in the arbor, and smoked in silence for many minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, Bob,&rdquo; Cox said, at  last, &ldquo;do you know anything that you want to keep to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Bob  returned, but it was a longish pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I say. If you do,  I&rsquo;ll respect your wishes and not ask for full confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound you, Cox, I don&rsquo;t know  what you&rsquo;re talking about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you do, but we&rsquo;ll let it  go at that. Now, as to what you said, a few moments since. That there are more  things to be divulged about Fairy. Did you mean anything definite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure did. Oh, don&rsquo;t think I  haven&rsquo;t been on the job, but there are many things I can&rsquo;t bear to tell old  Guy. Now, you&rsquo;ve seen the note found in the blotting book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was written to&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man with the hat. Fairy&rsquo;s pal  and partner in crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Didn&rsquo;t you get  the meaning of the healed snowdrops?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll say I did. You tell me  first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It merely meant that Fairy lifted  the pearls,&mdash; the snowdrops&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that she had concealed them  in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hollow heel of her slipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s how I read it.&rdquo; Cox  looked keenly at the other. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what you meant must come out about the  girl, and would so upset Guy that you wanted to save him any other bad news, if  possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it, exactly. It must  come out about the pearls, we can&rsquo;t gloss that over. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, how did you catch on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the attempts to get  Fairy&rsquo;s shoes. You see, that Terrill, who pretended to be a reporter, is  Fairy&rsquo;s pal, and as I see it, he had been threatening her, and she, secure in  her position here, had snapped her fingers at him. Yet, she told him she had  the pearls,&mdash;the snowdrops, and that they were in the heel of her shoe, which,  very likely he had had made for the purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t send that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I think she decided not to  tell him, at least not at once, and she left the letter unfinished to sleep  over it. Then, friend pal came that same night, late, and demanded the pearls.  Fairy refused and he doctored the milk and went away. Next day, he came back,  as a reporter, and inquired about her clothes and all that. Next night he  appeared to burgle her room of the shoes, and he met me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he has the pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he took the wrong shoes, and  this morning, while we were at the funeral, he came back and got another pair.  Dunno whether those are the right ones, or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came back here, this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He bamboozled Jenny into  letting him go into Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room. He got around her,&mdash; she&rsquo;s a  simpleton,&mdash;and he went off with the shoes. Pray Heaven they&rsquo;re the wrong ones,  too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they wouldn&rsquo;t be. He&rsquo;d make  sure this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. In fact, probably. But, in  any case, it makes Fairy the thief of Dorothy Reed&rsquo;s pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bob sighed deeply. &ldquo;I  suspected her at once. You see, they were trailing through the Guest House, and  she had every opportunity to lag behind and pick them up. Then put them in her  shoe heel, and no one could find them. This is what I dread to tell Guy. Every  fresh accusation against that girl, is like iron in his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loves her still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for he thinks these things  are all calumnies. But he&rsquo;ll have to give up when he knows she was a thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think when it&rsquo;s all  over, he&rsquo;ll swing back to Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. But Billy is getting a  very inside track, there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. Sylvia worships the  ground Guy walks on. She&rsquo;s playing Billy to spur up Guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Kit, don&rsquo;t you  say anything against Sylvia. She&rsquo;s salt of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, man, I know it. And I don&rsquo;t  mean anything against her. Any girl would do what she&rsquo;s doing. Merely accepting  the homage Billy shows her. It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what would she say, if she  knew of all Fairy&rsquo;s perfidy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be jolly well glad Guy is  rid of the little rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s glad of that, all  right. Now, we must make Guy glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he must know the worst of  her crimes and misdemeanors&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray heaven, he&rsquo;ll never know  that!&rdquo; exclaimed Bob, so fiercely that Cox glanced at him and quickly turned  his eyes away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t tell him,&rdquo;  he said, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bob responded, &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t if  I don&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Christopher Cox bided his  time.</p>
<p>Now, as it turned out, Sylvia was  a little miffed at being told to run away and play, by the two detectives.</p>
<p>She had walked off with Billy  Trigg, but a few moments later, she had dismissed that admirer and had silently  but determinedly gone back to a coign of vantage where she could overhear the  two men talk, without being seen herself.</p>
<p>She heard every word of their  conversation, and she felt in no whit ashamed, for, she argued to herself, it  was her case as much as anybody&rsquo;s. She had a right to know every development,  and to hear every bit of evidence or deduction.</p>
<p>So at the end of the conversation  between Arnold and Kit Cox, she was in full possession of all the facts and  surmises they had voiced.</p>
<p>And Sylvia was a girl of sudden  impulses.</p>
<p>She gathered that these two men  had reason to believe that the man who called himself Terrill, had the Reed  pearls in his possession, and moreover, as she understood it, he was or might  have been the murderer of Fairy.</p>
<p>To her mind, it seemed monstrous  that they should let one unnecessary moment elapse before they flew over to New  York and caught him with the goods.</p>
<p>How could they discuss it quietly  when he might be getting away and putting miles between himself and possible  pursuers.</p>
<p>With Sylvia a thing to be done,  was a thing to be done at once. And she determined to go herself and rescue the  pearls, or, at least, learn something definite about the matter.</p>
<p>She would take Jenny, so there  would be no danger of unpleasantness, and she could start directly after lunch  and be back by dinner time.</p>
<p>Anything she could do to help Guy  was a thing to be done, and at once.</p>
<p>She ordered her car, and her  chauffeur, and told Jenny she was to accompany her to New York.</p>
<p>Sylvia was not addle-pated, but in  any great enthusiasm she was liable to forget a vital point. And it was only  after they were well on their way, that she realized she did not know the  address of the man she was after.</p>
<p>She knew he was not named Terrill,  and that he was no reporter. She had gathered from piecing together bits she  had heard, that the man called Blackie, who was Fairy&rsquo;s dancing partner, and  the pseudo reporter, Terrill, were one and the same.</p>
<p>So, she calmly told the chauffeur  to go to the night club, where Blackie danced.</p>
<p>So unversed was Sylvia in the ways  of the more rapid circles of society that she was amazed to find the night club  deserted, and nobody about but a sort of caretaker.</p>
<p>She had gone in alone, bidding  Jenny and Rogers, the chauffeur, to stay outside, but within easy call.</p>
<p>She was not at all afraid, but she  greatly feared her errand would be futile.</p>
<p>She approached the nonchalant  though good-looking young man, whose manners were of the careless and easy  variety.</p>
<p>He was at a desk, figuring on some  accounts.</p>
<p>He looked up and appraised Sylvia  quickly, with an admiring glance.</p>
<p>But he spoke respectfully and  politely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you want, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brought face to face with this  very real situation, Sylvia was a little dazed, but she said, quietly: &ldquo;Can you  give me the home address of the dancing gentleman, known as Mr. Blackie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, but I don&rsquo;t think I will,&rdquo;  he responded, not rudely, but in a tone of one humoring a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; and Sylvia put on her  utmost dignity of manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss, to tell you the  truth, Blackie ain&rsquo;t no person for you to pal up with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose to pal up with  him,&rdquo; she returned haughtily. &ldquo;I merely want his address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and the man spoke  with decision. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get it offa me. No, ma&rsquo;am, you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He returned  his attention to his work, and Sylvia boiled with rage. She did not appreciate  his evident motive, which was entirely for her own good, and she tried once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me. It is a most  important matter I wish to see him about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t home now, anyway. He&rsquo;s  never home of an afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t hafto, ma&rsquo;am. But I&rsquo;ll  hafto ask you to excuse me. I&rsquo;ve a heap of work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Sylvia gave in,  &ldquo;will you tell me the address of Mrs. Craig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Craig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She is&mdash;was the landlady of  Miss Fairy Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man showed a lively interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know Fairy Lovell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I knew of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see no harm giving  you Mrs. Craig&rsquo;s address. Here,&mdash;&rdquo; he hastily scribbled it on a bit of paper and  tossed it to her. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said Sylvia, and  went back to her car, just as Rogers was beginning to feel anxious.</p>
<p>Miss Sylvia had never visited such  a place before, and though both Rogers and Jenny had a suspicion the visit was  in some way connected with the tragedy at Warlock House, they were uneasy until  they saw Sylvia return, safe and sound.</p>
<p>The next address, that of Mrs.  Craig, over on the East Fifties, was entirely respectable and though the two  left behind in the car, had no notion of what Sylvia&rsquo;s errand here might be, at  least it was not a dangerous looking place.</p>
<p>Ringing the bell, Sylvia was  admitted and soon Mrs. Craig appeared.</p>
<p>She sensed at once that whatever  her errand, Sylvia was not looking for rooms, and she showed but a slight  interest.</p>
<p>Sylvia exerted all her power to  charm, but had small success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve come to question me  further about Fairy Lovell, you can save your breath,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig informed her.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told all I know, and I&rsquo;m sick and tired of having detectives and  reporters and police and Lord knows who, chasing here with their old questions.  I haven&rsquo;t time to spend on the matter, my time is worth money, though nobody  seems to realize that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia took the hint and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your time is a valuable  asset, Mrs. Craig. And recognizing that, I propose to pay you for it. Please  accept this, and give me a few moments&rsquo; conversation, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>This</i> being a twenty dollar bill of  a pleasing yellow color, Mrs. Craig thawed at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me a beggar,&rdquo; she  said, a little pathetically, &ldquo;but honest, those people just pestered me to  death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay they did,&rdquo; returned  Sylvia, sympathetically. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll only keep you a short time, and I&rsquo;ll be  grateful for a little information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craig,  helpfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  The Lock-up</b></h2>
<p>First of all,&rdquo; Sylvia began,  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to spare my feelings. Please tell me what you know of Fairy Lovell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you call her,&rdquo; Mrs.  Craig interrupted. &ldquo;But the name we knew her by was Goldie Glenn. She was a  wonder, I&rsquo;ll say that for her. And when she got her hooks into that rich  Mackenzie man, she planned very carefully to marry him. Of course, she had to  be most respectable, so she came here to live and brought Lora Grant along as  her mother. Lora makes a first-class mother, and Goldie promised her big pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Goldie put it all over just  as she planned. Young Mr. Mackenzie he fell for it all like a lamb. And nobody  could blame him, for it all looked plausible and correct. But the day Goldie  went off to the Mackenzie house party, Lora kicked over the traces and lit out.  Said she couldn&rsquo;t stand it another minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she? Could I go to see  her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I s&rsquo;pose so. I&rsquo;ll give  you her address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Now here&rsquo;s another  thing. This man they call Blackie, he was Miss Lovell&rsquo;s&mdash;Miss Glenn&rsquo;s dancing  partner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Do you know all about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not all. I want to know more.  What&rsquo;s his address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you don&rsquo;t want to go to see  him, ma&rsquo;am. Take my advice and don&rsquo;t do it. He&rsquo;s a bad one. he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, give me his address,  anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he killed Goldie,  do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not attending to that part of  it. If he did, the detectives will get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want of him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I want to see  him at all. But I&rsquo;ll take his address on a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig sighed, but she  scribbled the address, on a scrap of paper and gave it to Sylvia, who tucked it  in her purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know much of Miss Glenn&rsquo;s  past life?&rdquo; she asked, in a casual tone.</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig gave her a quick  glance, and replied: &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, not much. I&rsquo;ve only known her about a year or  so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know anything about  her career, before you made her acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short pause, Mrs. Craig  said :</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want it straight, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; declared Sylvia.  &ldquo;Tell me the worst. Was she a thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my lord, I never heard that  she was,&rdquo; and Mrs. Craig gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what was it about her that  was so dreadful you hesitate to tell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it was only rumors  like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what were the rumors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they did say that she  poisoned her husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Sylvia. &ldquo;Was she  married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told, ma&rsquo;am. And her  husband died, and they was reports that she did for him. But, as I say, that  was long before I knew her, and I can&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long before you knew her! Why,  she&rsquo;s only twenty, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;s more like  twenty-six or twenty-seven. She looked a heap younger than she was. Them  blondes do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia was stunned. Fairy  twenty-six years old and married!</p>
<p>And they had all thought her  twenty and unsophisticated. Well, maybe not quite that, but innocent and  guileless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was this husband of hers a  dancer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I don&rsquo;t think  so. For Goldie never palled up much with the profesh. She was out for bigger  game. Many&rsquo;s the millionaire she&rsquo;s had on her string, but she never landed a  real big fish until Mr. Mackenzie fell for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And Mr. Mackenzie is  himself so fine and upright, it never occurred to him that the girl could be  other than the lovely child she seemed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely child is good!&rdquo; Mrs. Craig  smiled grimly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s small wonder the gentleman thought that. Goldie came  here, and set herself up with Lora as an invalid mother, and naturally, Mr.  Mackenzie swallowed her story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all did. We may not have admired  her quite as much as he did, but we all believed she was just what she seemed,  a sweet young girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m. I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m beginning to understand.  These things are novel to my experience, but I can comprehend the situation  when it is put before me. Now, I will go, and I thank you for your time and  attention. Good afternoon, Mrs. Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, ma&rsquo;am. And you take my  advice and don&rsquo;t go near that man Blackie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia went out to her car, and  gave the chauffeur an address near the home of the redoubtable Blackie. She was  determined to see this thing through, and Sylvia&rsquo;s determination was of a  headstrong type.</p>
<p>The chauffeur stopped at the  number she had said, and getting out of the car, Sylvia disappeared round the  corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Rogers said to  the placid Jenny. &ldquo;Miss Sylvia going to all these queer places. I don&rsquo;t like  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Jenny assured  him. &ldquo;Miss Sylvia isn&rsquo;t one to do things she ought not to. She knows what she&rsquo;s  about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so and maybe not. This  quarter is none too respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks all right,&rdquo; Jenny observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s a gay part of  town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look so gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. These birds are  nighthawks. They&rsquo;re quiet enough by daylight and they bloom out late at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t late at night  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s five o&rsquo;clock, and  high time Miss Sylvia was a-going back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said  Jenny, comfortably. &ldquo;Miss Sylvia knows what she&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; reiterated  Rogers, and Jenny vouchsafed no reply.</p>
<p>As Rogers had remarked, the house  to which Sylvia was awaiting admittance was quiet enough. No sound she heard  from inside, until at last a shuffling step approached the door, and the latch  clicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who you after?&rdquo; was the greeting  from the slatternly woman inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie,&rdquo; Sylvia said, staring  straight into the woman&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you be! And who be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his sister, and I want to see  him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he ain&rsquo;t in, he ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia&rsquo;s heart leaped for joy.  This was what she wanted. Had he been in, she intended to turn and flee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go up to his room and  wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that, if you like. Two  flights up. Middle room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shuffled away, as if  feeling her interest in the scene was over and thrilled at the adventure,  Sylvia ran up the none too clean stairs.</p>
<p>The middle room was easily found,  and trying the door and finding it not locked, Sylvia stepped inside.</p>
<p>She felt the need of quick action,  and began at once her search for the shoes, which the detectives had agreed,  held the pearls concealed in a hollow heel.</p>
<p>Through the dresser drawers she  swiftly rummaged, looked through a wardrobe trunk that stood open, and poked  into some small cupboards and drawers of a chiffonier.</p>
<p>There were no little shoes that  could have belonged to Fairy to be found.</p>
<p>But there was a large closet,  which she next tried.</p>
<p>She stepped inside, pleased that  there was a ceiling electric light which sprang into being as she opened the  door.</p>
<p>Quickly she made methodical  search, passing her hand swiftly over the clothing hanging on hooks, and  hastening on to the drawers which filled one end of the closet.</p>
<p>These she investigated with care,  for she felt sure the shoes would be there, when suddenly the door was slammed  shut and she was in utter darkness.</p>
<p>At first she was not much alarmed,  and hoped it might be the breeze from the open window that had blown the door  shut, but a second later, she heard the key turned in the lock, and knew she  was trapped.</p>
<p>Sylvia was no coward, in fact her  courage always increased in time of danger and she spoke no word and uttered no  outcry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Field,&rdquo; said a soft  voice, &ldquo;what are you doing in my clothes closet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me out and I&rsquo;ll tell you, Mr.  Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll tell me from where you  are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, at present I&rsquo;m doing  nothing. I can&rsquo;t see to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay not. What were you  doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for Goldie Glenn&rsquo;s  shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia felt intuitively that  frankness was her best role.</p>
<p>She was not really frightened, but  she was beginning to feel qualms, and she wished she had let the car come to  the house. As it was, Rogers and Jenny had no idea where she was, for after she  had turned the street corner, they could not see her.</p>
<p>She was sure that a calm  politeness was the best course to pursue, for the man showed no signs of  rudeness or threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said her interlocutor, &ldquo;you  are straightforward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; returned Sylvia.</p>
<p>Through the flimsy closet door  they could hear one another as if face to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you want with Miss  Glenn&rsquo;s shoes?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a question I might put to  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want them as a souvenir of the  best dancer I have ever had the honor to dance with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. And do you need two  pairs for that? And why do you resort to clandestine methods of getting them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackie&rsquo;s calm broke down. He gave  voice to an emphatic swear word and then was silent.</p>
<p>Sylvia rejoiced to think she had  pierced his armor, but as the silence continued, she became alarmed.</p>
<p>She listened at the keyhole but  could hear no breathing, nor any sound at all, save the quickened beating of  her own heart.</p>
<p>She hated to lower her pride by  speaking, and resolved to keep silence. She assumed the man had retreated to  the other side of the room, and was trying to make her think he had gone out  and left her there in captivity.</p>
<p>She stood it just as long as she  could and then she spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no answer, and  Sylvia sensed that the room was empty. There is a different sort of silence  between an empty room and one containing a silent person.</p>
<p>Again and again she repeated her  call, each time a little louder, but finally she felt, and the cold chills ran  down her spine, that she would get no response. Either the man was determined  not to speak, or he had really gone away.</p>
<p>Sylvia pondered. She had got  herself into this mess and she had no one but herself to get her out of it.</p>
<p>If only she had let Rogers bring  her round the corner. But he and Jenny could have no idea where she had gone  after she turned off; out of their sight.</p>
<p>Still unafraid, she thought over  the situation.</p>
<p>It was dark, save for a tiny ray  of light through the keyhole. A very tiny ray, for the key was still in the  door.</p>
<p>She felt about for the electric  light bulb, but it was in the ceiling, and too, it probably only lighted at the  opening of the door.</p>
<p>However, the darkness was the  least of her troubles.</p>
<p>Here she was, immured in the  closet of the contemptible Blackie, a night club dancer, a thief of pearls, a  partner of one who, she was forced to think, was as bad as the man himself.</p>
<p>Sylvia was so shocked by the recent  revelations that had come to her, she well nigh forgot her predicament in  thinking them over.</p>
<p>Yet, as she stood, until she began  to grow weary, she came back to a realization of her present plight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t leave me here forever,&rdquo;  she mused. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to come back soon and liberate me. He didn&rsquo;t seem ugly,  I don&rsquo;t believe he means me any real harm, but just to give me a scare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia was deceiving herself and  she knew it.</p>
<p>At the bottom of her heart, she  was terribly afraid that he did mean to leave her there, indefinitely.</p>
<p>What could she do? There must be  some way out. Surely Rogers and Jenny would set up a search for her soon.</p>
<p>But could they find her? They had  no idea what house she was in, or on what street.</p>
<p>After long thought, she came to  the conclusion her only hope of release was to scream. Surely, then, somebody  must come to her assistance.</p>
<p>She set up a mild cry, but it  brought no response of any sort.</p>
<p>For all she could hear the house  was silent as a tomb. Was everybody out of it? Oh, why hadn&rsquo;t she temporized  with the man until he let her out!</p>
<p>Reason told her that he had become  scared at her reference to the second pair of shoes, and had fled, and&mdash;might  never come back!</p>
<p>If he had the pearls, he would  have no need for his belongings in his room, and likely as not by this time he  was far away.</p>
<p>If only she hadn&rsquo;t been so  precipitate. She as good as accused him of wrong doing, and being quick-witted,  he had caught on and had simply disappeared.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, there was  nothing for her to do, but yell until somebody came and let her out. Somebody  must come. They couldn&rsquo;t stand a screaming woman for long.</p>
<p>So she set to work in earnest and  called out, louder and louder, until she had reached the limit of her voice&rsquo;s  strength and had a sore throat beside.</p>
<p>But all to no avail.</p>
<p>Whether the occupants of the house  were all deaf, or whether there were no occupants, she didn&rsquo;t know. But nobody  came into the room.</p>
<p>Utterly wearied with the exertion  of screaming; and also tired from long standing, Sylvia sank to the floor, at  last utterly disheartened and frightened.</p>
<p>Meantime the placid Jenny and the  apprehensive Rogers were becoming alarmed.</p>
<p>Miss Field had been absent more  than half an hour. She had said she would be but a few moments. What could be  the explanation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you it was a bad lookout,&rdquo;  Rogers said, glad to vent his nervous fears on somebody. &ldquo;Now what can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Jenny. &ldquo;Miss  Sylvia&rsquo;s all right&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe and maybe not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her time. She&rsquo;ll come in a  few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s placidity calmed Rogers  for a time, but presently he began to worry again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; he exclaimed.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do something. I&rsquo;m going to telephone Mr. Guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bidding Jenny stay in the car, and  take care of Sylvia, should she return, Rogers went in search of the nearest  public telephone.</p>
<p>He soon got Guy on the wire and  explained to him the circumstances.</p>
<p>He said, too, that Miss Field had  gone first to an address, which Guy at once recognized as that of Mrs. Craig.</p>
<p>Bidding Rogers go back to his car  and stay there, Guy hurried to the garage, ordered out his own swift roadster,  and telling only his chauffeur where he was going, he flew off to New York.</p>
<p>It was nearly six o&rsquo;clock, and he  determined to find Sylvia before dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;She has gone  after that Blackie person, I&rsquo;m sure. Just the sort of hasty thing she would fly  at. What for, I don&rsquo;t know, but she thinks, in some way, she is helping me.  Bless her dear heart! She&rsquo;s the real thing, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which goes to prove that Guy&rsquo;s  heart, like that of many another man, was swinging back to his first love.</p>
<p>He put his car through at its  utmost speed, slowing down only when the attentions of a traffic policeman  threatened delay.</p>
<p>In record time he reached Mrs.  Craig&rsquo;s house, and though he hated the sight of the place, he rang the bell  loudly.</p>
<p>Admitted, he wasted no time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Miss Field here this  afternoon?&rdquo; he asked, brusquely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Mackenzie, and she  said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what she said. Where  did she go? What address did you give her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake&rsquo;s. But I told her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Awed by the sternness of his  voice, Mrs. Craig obediently gave the number and the street, and Guy flung her  a hasty &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; and was back in his car again before she could utter  another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that beast has bothered her,&rdquo;  Guy was muttering, and then, as he passed a parked car, he heard some one call  his name.</p>
<p>Seeing it was Sylvia&rsquo;s car, he  drew up and called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&mdash;&rdquo; Rogers  began.</p>
<p>But Guy only called back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by. Stay where you are!&rdquo;  and went flying round the corner where Sylvia had disappeared.</p>
<p>Straight to the address Mrs. Craig  had given him he went, sprang out, locked his car and running up the steps  pushed the bell.</p>
<p>It seemed to him an interminable  wait, and he had already rung the bell twice more, when the shuffling steps  came along, and the old crone cried, pettishly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted? Don&rsquo;t break the  door down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Blake live here?&rdquo;  exploded Guy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well yes, sir, he does. But he  ain&rsquo;t in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go to his room and wait  for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy said this, feeling sure the  woman was lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cackled, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose  you&rsquo;re his brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still chuckling over her own joke,  she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on up, Mister, his sister&rsquo;s up  there a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She called after him the number of  the floor, but he was already half way up there.</p>
<p>As he took the last few steps at a  bound, he heard a heart-rending shriek and even through the harshness of the  tone, he recognized Sylvia&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>He burst into the room from which  the sound came, just in time to hear another scream, obviously from the closet.</p>
<p>Striding across the room, he  turned the key, and Sylvia, with a low cry of rapture fell into his arms.</p>
<p>She was so exhausted and so  overcome with gladness at sight of him, that she alternately laughed and cried,  and had a sort of near hysterics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylly, dear, it&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m  here, I&rsquo;ll take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his arms around her, his lips  on her brow, Sylvia quickly regained her poise and smiled back at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Guy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Guy, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Sylvia, darling. Time  later for explanations and all that. Let&rsquo;s get out of here. Where&rsquo;s the lord of  the manor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Take me away, Guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I will. Can you walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can. But I&rsquo;m a little  wobbly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lean on me, Grandpa, I&rsquo;m most  seven!&rdquo; he quoted. &ldquo;Here we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And go they did, down the two  flights of none too clean stairs, and out at the front door. Nobody saw them,  and nobody did they see.</p>
<p>Once outside, Guy put Sylvia in  his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rogers is around the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; Guy surprised  her.</p>
<p>Pausing a moment to tell Rogers  that all was well and that he would take Miss Field home, Guy bade Jenny return  with Rogers and get home as soon as they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever did you cut up that  trick for?&rdquo; Guy demanded, as soon as they were smoothly on their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get back Dorothy&rsquo;s pearls,&rdquo;  said Sylvia, with the demure manner of a naughty child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did! Well, those pearls  are safe and sound in Dorothy&rsquo;s jewel case, or wherever she keeps them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are! Who found them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve to know.  Sylvia, you mustn&rsquo;t do these wild things! Suppose I hadn&rsquo;t found you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know the old story of  the man that lost his horse. And a farmer&rsquo;s boy found the horse. And they said  to him, &lsquo;How did you know where to look?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Why, I thought if I was  a horse, where would I go? And I went there and he had.&rsquo; It was like that, you  see. I knew your blessed foolishness would take you hunting for that Blackie  person who was supposed to have taken the shoes, that had the heels that held  the pearls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lay in the house that Jack  built!&rdquo; finished Sylvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. But you needn&rsquo;t laugh,  you were in grave danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I s&rsquo;pose so. But when I&rsquo;m in  grave danger, you&rsquo;ll always come to my rescue, won&rsquo;t you, Guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sylvia,&rdquo; he said in a tone  so serious, that she looked up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried, dear,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;because the police are getting more and more decided in their opinions. And  they&rsquo;re positive that little Fairy was killed by either Dad or myself. Now, I  can&rsquo;t let Dad go under, so I&rsquo;ll have to confess. There&rsquo;s no other way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Sylvia, &ldquo;I shall  have to put my finger into the pie again. I go to New York, to hunt the pearls,  and you come to me and tell me the pearls are found. I must, I suppose,  confess, myself, to the killing of Fairy, and then the truth will course out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trifle,&rdquo; said Guy very  seriously. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Truth</b></h2>
<p>Reaching home, Sylvia, ran off to  her own rooms to dress for dinner.</p>
<p>The meal had been postponed until  she and Guy should arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be a long time,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;for I must scrub hard to get off all the atmosphere of that dreadful  place! Think of being shut up with that man&rsquo;s wardrobe for hours and hours and  hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Sylly, it was less  than two hours,&rdquo; Guy corrected her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemed like two hundred,&rdquo; she  returned, and ran away to dress.</p>
<p>The dinner was the most cheerful occasion  they had had since the tragedy, for Sylvia&rsquo;s return was the cause of much joy  and tragic thoughts were banished. But afterwards, in the drawing-room, the  matter was taken up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about the pearls,&rdquo;  Sylvia demanded. &ldquo;Where were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell,&rdquo; said Dorothy,  &ldquo;they&rsquo;re my pearls. Why, Sylvia, that wonderful Mr. Cox found them. First, he  assumed that &lsquo;the snowdrops are healed,&rsquo; meant the pearls were concealed in the  heels of some of Fairy&rsquo;s shoes. How he puzzled that out, I don&rsquo;t know. But he  did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew that,&rdquo; Sylvia told  her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I went to New York. That Blackie person is her partner in  crime, you see, and he has taken away two pairs of Fairy&rsquo;s shoes already,  without getting the right ones. How did you find out which were the right ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cox declared there must be  some shoes hidden. He didn&rsquo;t think Fairy would leave the ones with the pearls  in, lying around, even over night. So he hunted her room again. We all hunted.  And at last, Mr. Cox was staring about, when he gave a wild shriek and grabbed  a chair and climbed up to look on top of that tall wardrobe. And there was a  pair of scarlet shoes up there. The top of the wardrobe is sunken, you know how  they are, sometimes, and there were the shoes snuggled down in the space inside  the cornice of the wardrobe! He came down off the chair with a jump, and he  just tore off those heels! He needn&rsquo;t have done that, for there was the cutest  little spring catch,&mdash;you see they were shoes made for smuggling,&mdash;any way,  inside those heels were my pearls! Half in each shoe. Think of that dainty  little beauty, for she was a beauty, being a horrid thief! She must have  gathered in the pearls as we went around the house, Sunday afternoon, and just  slipped them in her bag, until she could get to her room and put them in the  hollow heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvia looked at Dorothy, with a  sudden interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;then that was  that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cryptic, Sylly,&rdquo; said  Guy. &ldquo;What was what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that night,&mdash;Sunday night,  you know, Jenny was looking after Fairy, and then she came to me, and said  Fairy had said she would sit up for a while and read, before she went to bed.  Jenny had given her a kimono and bedroom slippers. Well, then after Jenny had  left me, I heard Fairy moving about her room, and I heard two sounds like two  shoes pitched across the room. You know the sound of a falling shoe is  unmistakable. I paid little attention at the time, but I did think it was  curious. Now, that must have been Fairy throwing those shoes, with the pearls  in the heels, up on top of the wardrobe, knowing they would fall down out of  sight, in that hollow top!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without doubt, that&rsquo;s just what  she did,&rdquo; said Cox. &ldquo;I suppose she thought they would be safe there, and she  could retrieve them after the excitement about them was over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we must conclude that  Blake, or Blackie, was Fairy&rsquo;s pal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Cox who made the remark,  but Guy&rsquo;s sudden agonized cry of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Kit!&rdquo; stopped him in his speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, old man,&rdquo; Cox spoke very  kindly, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re in this thing now, and we have to see it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Bob Arnold, &ldquo;we must  see it through.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then Billy Trigg broke in with the  ultimatum that the subject should be taboo for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we must go through with it,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;let us have a pleasant and carefree evening, and let tomorrow take  care of tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Reeds agreed eagerly to this.  Dorothy was so happy over the recovery of her pearls that she ignored all other  trouble.</p>
<p>Already she was planning to leave  Warlock House the next day, for there was no telling what further tragedy might  be impending.</p>
<p>But the rest of the group made  little response to Billy&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>Each one had his own thoughts and  in no case were they pleasant or even hopeful ones.</p>
<p>Guy became more and more certain that  he must confess to a crime he didn&rsquo;t do, in order to save his father, who, he  felt convinced, did do it.</p>
<p>He believed that the police would  accept his confession, for they were positive that the criminal was one or  other of the Mackenzies.</p>
<p>He was by no means sure his father  would let him make the sacrifice, yet, a man will do much to save his life.  Anyway, Guy, in his devotion, planned to declare his own guilt.</p>
<p>Mullins was perplexed. He knew one  thing that he hadn&rsquo;t yet told. But the suspicion it would engender was so  preposterous, so unbelievable, that he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to give it voice.</p>
<p>Sylvia was weary and nervous after  her experience of the afternoon, and the two detectives, Cox and Arnold, were  moody and taciturn.</p>
<p>Things were going badly, thought  all concerned, except the jubilant Reeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great scheme, those hollow-heeled  shoes,&rdquo; Egbert chuckled. &ldquo;Wonder she didn&rsquo;t put it over. And who ever would  have suspected that little blossom of a girl to be such a wicked person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how old she was?&rdquo;  Sylvia asked, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, what was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy.  &ldquo;I thought her about nineteen or twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy rose and left the room, and  his father followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you people wouldn&rsquo;t talk  about the girl,&rdquo; Cox said reprovingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see how it flicks Guy on the  raw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Dorothy said. &ldquo;I should  have been more tactful. But really, he&rsquo;s well rid of her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll come to see that  later,&rdquo; Sylvia said. &ldquo;But now, he still loves her and he can&rsquo;t bear to hear a  word against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant came in then, and told  Cox somebody wanted to see him.</p>
<p>Cox went out to find Hunter  awaiting him. &ldquo;Sorry, Mr. Cox,&rdquo; the policeman said to him, &ldquo;but, I don&rsquo;t think  we can put off making an arrest much longer. We are sure that girl was killed  by Mr. Mackenzie or his son. Now, here&rsquo;s the way we dope it out. Nobody else  had any reason to want her put out of the way, but those two. Some think Miss  Field was jealous, but she wasn&rsquo;t, not to the point of committing murder  anyway. No, sir, it was one of the Mackenzie men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand why you might  suspect Mr. Mackenzie, Senior, for he didn&rsquo;t like the girl at all. But what  could have been Guy&rsquo;s motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. There was  some man came to see Miss Lovell late Sunday night, very late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, between two and three o&rsquo;clock  in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that was the man Mr. Mullins  saw, with a hat on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Well, Guy Mackenzie saw  him too, from his window, and he saw him go into Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room, saw her  admit him, we&rsquo;ll say. So Mr. Guy tears over there, and in a fit of rage at the  girl&rsquo;s infidelity to him, he kills her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Mr. Hunter, that  might do if she had been shot or stabbed. But you can&rsquo;t see a man administering  poison&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can. Now, I&rsquo;ve got it  out of the Gersons that a man was in Miss Lovell&rsquo;s room late that night. Those  two know more than they told at first. They heard the man in the house. They  don&rsquo;t know who it was, but they do know it wasn&rsquo;t Guy Mackenzie. It was a  stranger. He walked across the hall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, he walked across the  hall while they looked over the banister. They can&rsquo;t describe him, they say it  was too dark to see him clearly,&mdash;but I happen to know the lights were still on.  Well, anyway, there must have been such a man for the Gersons both saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on, who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, but he must  have been the pal or lover of Miss Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t Guy kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose he got away as  quick as he could. Then, Mr. Guy had it out with his girl. No telling what she  said, but she flounced away to the bathroom,&mdash;the Gersons and Miss Field all  agree on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, still raging at her  for betraying him, Mr. Guy puts the poison in Miss Lovell&rsquo;s glass of milk and  goes back to the other house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a ridiculous farrago of  nonsense, that&rsquo;s the worst I ever heard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sir, there&rsquo;s another choice.  That is, that Mr. Ralph Mackenzie did it. He had motive, plenty of it. He had  ample opportunity. All he had to do, was to slip across the hall, when Miss  Lovell was in the bathroom and drop the powder in her milk. Also he had plenty  of chances to put a packet of powdered poison in Miss Field&rsquo;s room, and in his  own dresser drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&quot;Just to muddle the case, of  course. It&rsquo;s strange, but the average citizen thinks the more complicated clues  he can manage to scatter about, the more difficult a case is to solve. Whereas,  every queer clue is a help to the detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Cox, a little dryly,  &ldquo;it seems to have helped you to a lot of conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the complacent Hunter,  unaware of any sarcasm. &ldquo;And so, we&rsquo;re going to arrest young Mackenzie first,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t make an ass of  yourself,&rdquo; Cox exclaimed, angrily. &ldquo;Look here, Hunter, you&rsquo;re on the wrong  track. I&rsquo;ll put you straight on one point, anyway. Those two Mackenzie men  think each other guilty. Now, you know as well as I do, that automatically  clears them both. If Guy thinks his father guilty, he can&rsquo;t be guilty himself,  and vice versa. I&rsquo;m only thankful you haven&rsquo;t dragged in Miss Field as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she had anything to  do with it, although, of course, she had a sort of motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did and a strong one.  Everybody supposed she would marry Guy Mackenzie, and then along comes that  little flibbertigibbet and carries him off under her very nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she had wonderful  opportunity. And she could easily have put those poison packets in her room and  in Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s room, believing that as they were so palpably planted, it  would remove all suspicion from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunter looked perplexed. Cox was  so logical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Cox went on, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think  for a minute I suspect Miss Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nor, for that matter, do I  suspect either of the Mackenzies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, then, do you suspect, Mr.  Cox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell you tonight,&rdquo;  Cox spoke very gravely now. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ll give me another twenty-four hours, I  think I can tell you the real criminal, and I think you&rsquo;ll be greatly  surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will my men get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you they shall not.  Come, Mr. Hunter, give me your word you&rsquo;ll wait twenty-four hours before making  any arrest, and you&rsquo;ll thereby save yourself a great deal of embarrassment and  regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Cox, I know your  reputation. I know if you tell me this, you are pretty sure of your facts. And  if you agree to produce these two men, if we want them, at the end of  twenty-four hours, I&rsquo;ll go you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Hunter. You&rsquo;ll be  mighty glad of that decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go along now, and leave  the matter in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may safely do so. I know what  I&rsquo;m about, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m right. Good night, Hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Mr. Cox. I don&rsquo;t know  what Baird will say, but I&rsquo;m banking on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may safely do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunter went off and Cox went at  once to his room to think things out.</p>
<p>He had been rather cocksure with  the police detective, and while he still felt he was right, there were some  points that must be proved.</p>
<p>He concluded at last, that he must  see Blake, and must see him just as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So he decided he would motor to  New York the next morning, very early and attend to that matter.</p>
<p>It was late, now, but Cox stepped  out of his room, and softly along the corridor to the room Mullins occupied.</p>
<p>A light tap brought Mullins to the  door, and he beckoned Cox in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a word with you, Mull,&rdquo; the  detective began. &ldquo;Who was the man you saw outside the gardener&rsquo;s cottage, late  Sunday night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mullins looked irresolute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to tell you?&rdquo; he  said, in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; and coming  closer, Cox whispered a name in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mullins said, his eyes  staring wide in surprise. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. It was a wild  guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you guessed right. But I  can&rsquo;t understand it a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try. Just keep still for a  little longer, and I&rsquo;ll bring this thing to a head. But, crickey, what a  mix-up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cox went softly back to his room,  for the household was quiet by this time;. He managed to get some restful  sleep, and next morning he was up by seven o&rsquo;clock, and at the garage for his  car.</p>
<p>The chauffeurs were not yet there,  so he managed for himself and was soon speeding to New York in the lovely  freshness of the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could ask him,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;but  I have to be certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped at the first roadhouse  he found open and succeeded in getting a tolerable breakfast, and then hurried  on to the city.</p>
<p>By nine o&rsquo;clock he was in front of  the house where Sylvia had undergone her martyrdom the afternoon before.</p>
<p>There was no sign of life, but Cox  strode up to the front door, and rang the bell loudly.</p>
<p>A sleepy looking maid answered,  and Cox demanded to see Mr. Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;he  ain&rsquo;t never up in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be this morning,&rdquo; Cox  assured her. &ldquo;Go and tell him Mr. Cox must see him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking dubious she went on her  errand, and returned later, to say he could go up to Mr. Blake&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>So up he went, and a voice said,  &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; in response to his tap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; the same voice said,  after Cox had opened the door and entered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a detective, and a good one.  I&rsquo;ve heard of you. Whatcha want of me? I haven&rsquo;t done any wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t! Well, it wasn&rsquo;t  because you didn&rsquo;t try! One more search and you might have found the shoes you  were after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I&rsquo;d made that last search,  then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut out the jocularity. It won&rsquo;t  get you anywhere. Now, if you want to evade arrest for forcible entrance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twasn&rsquo;t forcible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, Monday night. The night  you knocked Mr. Arnold down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He flew at me like a wildcat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it was the other way. But  I&rsquo;m in a hurry. You tell me what I want to know, and I&rsquo;ll see you&rsquo;re not  molested by the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to know that you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to tell me who was  Fairy Lovell&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was, and you know it. Now,  out with it. What was his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Cox.  Honest, I don&rsquo;t. You see after&mdash;after he died she went back to her own name,  Glenn. The Lovell was a very recent one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now how did her husband  die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was long before I knew her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you&rsquo;ve heard. Rumors,  anyway. Tell me, or you&rsquo;ll be arrested within an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know is, I heard, that he  was&mdash;was poisoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought so. She seems to  be mixed up in poison cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some people thought she did  it, but there was not enough evidence to arrest her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. That is the information I  was after. And you don&rsquo;t know the man&rsquo;s name? Honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest I don&rsquo;t. She never used  it, you see. Went by her own name even when she was married to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six or seven years ago, I  think. Maybe only five, or so. I&rsquo;ve only known her two or three years myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few more questions and Cox was  off. He had planned to speak about Blake&rsquo;s detention of Sylvia the day before,  but he felt sure it was only a bit of devilish mischief, and he hated to speak  Sylvia&rsquo;s name to that undesirable citizen.</p>
<p>So back to Warlock House he went,  and found the household in a state of commotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what do you think?&rdquo; Sylvia  cried as he came into the lounge, where they were gathered. &ldquo;Bob Arnold has  gone,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but he left a  letter to be given to you, as soon as you came back. I suppose he is on some  trail, but he took all his things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other trail,&rdquo; Billy Trigg  said. &ldquo;For as he went away, he said, &lsquo;Let Cox take the case all himself now.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like Bob to be jealous  or snippy,&rdquo; said Guy. &ldquo;However, Kit, open up the letter and we&rsquo;ll know all  about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think old Bob is jealous  or snippy,&rdquo; Cox declared. &ldquo;More likely he&rsquo;s been called away. Well, wait till I  get a clean-up and we&rsquo;ll see about that precious letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cox went off to his room, taking  the letter with him.</p>
<p>It was some time before he  returned, and then he looked grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the lounge, everybody,  or, Guy, is there a better place, where we shall not be interrupted? I&rsquo;ve a lot  to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the small library,&rdquo; Guy  said. &ldquo;Want Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure do,&rdquo; returned Cox. &ldquo;I want  everybody.&rdquo; So the family and the guests were collected, and Cox closed the  door of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked over this letter,&rdquo; he  announced, &ldquo;and now I shall read it to you. I am not altogether surprised at  its contents, for I have heard things to rouse my suspicions. But many of you will  be surprised, and we will all be saddened. Now, without further preamble, I&rsquo;ll  read it. It is, as you know, from Bob Arnold.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Kit;&rdquo; the letter began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  leaving here in a few moments and I want you to read this letter to the crowd.</p>
<p class="note">There is much to be said, but I  will be as brief as possible. It all began when I reached Warlock House, last  Friday afternoon. As you know Fairy Lovell had not yet arrived. But Guy gave us  her pictures to look at.</p>
<p class="note">Can you imagine my amazement when  I recognized her as the girl who, long ago was the wife of my brother, Ned. It  was impossible that I could be mistaken, there is no double of that exquisite  face in the world. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. You see, the name of Fairy Lovell  meant nothing to me, but when I saw the pictures I realized who she was.  Immediately, I said, I must leave the next morning, before she arrived. I couldn&rsquo;t  meet her. So I went away and tried to forget. If I had any qualms about her  marrying Guy, I thought at once that Guy knew his own business and I had no  right to interfere.</p>
<p class="note">Yet I was anxious, and by Saturday  afternoon, I had worried myself nearly sick about it. For, you see, Goldie  Glenn, as we knew her, killed my brother Ned.</p>
<p class="note">Others suspected it at the time;  but not enough evidence proved it, so she was never arrested. Also, nobody  would have believed it could be, for Goldie was even more angelic then, than at  the time she died.</p>
<p class="note">Well, I was so upset over it all,  that I felt I just couldn&rsquo;t leave Guy to meet a similar fate, unwarned. It  might not have occurred at all, but I knew what I knew. You see, just before my  brother died, he pulled my head down to his and whispered, &lsquo;Goldie did it. She  poisoned me with the sugar on the marshmallows. It had arsenic in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">Had he told me sooner, I might  have got a doctor or an antidote, but it was too late. Goldie was out, &mdash;alibi,  you see&mdash;but Ned said with his last conscious breath, &lsquo;She killed me, Bob. You  must kill her.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">I never had any intention of  killing her, but when I found she was fooling Guy the same way she fooled my  brother, I had to see what I could do.</p>
<p class="note">So after thinking it over, I  concluded to go up to see her, late some night, and threaten that if she did  not give up Guy, I would tell all I knew about her and give her over to the  police. My testimony would have convicted her, for it was practically that of  an eye witness.</p>
<p class="note">I went up to Warlock House on Sunday  night. I parked my car far from the house, down among the thick shrubbery, then  I went near the Cottage, where I knew she was to be lodged, and waited.</p>
<p class="note">I was there from before two  o&rsquo;clock on. I saw Guy come over and insist on admittance to Goldie&rsquo;s room. She  had to let him in, he was so determined. He didn&rsquo;t stay long, and after that  Blake come. Then I knew there was mischief afoot. If those two scheming  scoundrels were partners, nobody had a show.</p>
<p class="note">They whispered and hobnobbed, and  planned. Blackie would say things,&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t hear them,&mdash; and she would nod her  head understandingly.</p>
<p class="note">At last he went away, and then I  was keyed up to denounce her to anybody.</p>
<p class="note">But I planned to speak to her  first. If I could persuade her to go away then, at once, I would take her back  to New York and Guy would be safe.</p>
<p class="note">I watched and waited for a while,  her window was ajar and her room brightly lighted, and I saw she was nervous  and excited, but that she was eagerly interested in something she was about to  do.</p>
<p class="note">And this is what she did. She took  from her trunk a packet of something.</p>
<p class="note">She stood by her night table, and  slowly dropped some of the contents of the packet into her glass of milk.</p>
<p class="note">I remembered the white powder that  looked like marshmallow dust but was arsenic, and I wondered if she meant to  commit suicide.</p>
<p class="note">If that was her intention, I was  not going to interfere, for she was a menace and the world far better off  without her.</p>
<p class="note">But her face, as she dropped the  poison in the milk, was positively diabolical! It meant murder, no one but a  murderer could look like that! Then I was alarmed. She had killed my brother,&mdash;who  was to be her new victim? It couldn&rsquo;t be Guy, for she couldn&rsquo;t cross the lawn  carrying that glass. Could it be she was about to kill Sylvia? But why?</p>
<p class="note">And then, I saw her pick up the  glass, with a steady hand, but still with that merciless face, and she very  softly opened her door, and slipped across the hall. I stepped along the  verandah of the cottage, and I looked in at Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s window on the other  side of the front door.</p>
<p class="note">There, by the dim night light, I  saw her place the glass of poisoned milk on his night table, and take away his  glass of pure milk.</p>
<p class="note">Softly, she closed his door and  returned to her own room, where she put the good milk on her own little table.  Then she smiled and danced a little pirouette about the room.</p>
<p class="note">And then, she gathered up some  towels and things, and using less care for silence, she slipped out of her door  again, and went to the bathroom. A moment later, I heard the bath running, and  I knew she was out of her room for a time.</p>
<p class="note">Now, this is what I did. Think of  me as you will. One time Guy Mackenzie saved my life. I determined to save his  father&rsquo;s life. I knew Goldie was marrying Guy for his money. She hated Guy&rsquo;s  father and he didn&rsquo;t like her. So, she went up to the house party, prepared not  only to kill Ralph Mackenzie, but to cast the blame, by her prepared packets,  on Sylvia, or have it adjudged a suicide.</p>
<p class="note">So, I stepped softly into her  room, carefully picked up the glass of milk which I knew to be pure, and  quickly crossing the hall I entered Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s room, and exchanged the  glasses.</p>
<p class="note">The one she had set on his table,  and which I believed to be poisoned, I took back and placed on her table.</p>
<p class="note">I make no excuses, I knew what I  was doing, or probably doing. But, I argued, if the milk was not poisoned, (I  knew nothing then of the packets; for all I knew, she might have put in a  sleeping powder), there would be no harm done to anyone. If she had poisoned  the milk, then it were far better she should drink it herself than that Ralph  Mackenzie should.</p>
<p class="note">There is my story. I am running  away from the possible consequences because I can&rsquo;t think it fair that she  should be the cause of the death of two brothers.</p>
<p class="note">She killed Ned, and I have avenged  his death. Incidentally, I saved Guy&rsquo;s father from death. And if I deprived Guy  of his sweetheart, it is better so.</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is  all.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Arnold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long before Cox finished reading  this aloud, Sylvia and Dorothy were weeping and the men were not ashamed of  their own tears.</p>
<p>Guy went over and sat by his  father, and Sylvia went to the other side of Ralph Mackenzie, who said,  solemnly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank God for preserving my  life, and Arnold for being the brave and worthy instrument in His hands. I want  to forget it all now, and live happily with my two dear children.</p>
<p>He put an arm round Sylvia, and  grasped Guy&rsquo;s hand. It was not hard to guess his meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give this letter to Hunter  tomorrow,&rdquo; Cox said. &ldquo;Bob will be well on his way, by then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; Mackenzie said.  &ldquo;Bob saved my life, and I shall do all I can to save his. Nobody would hold him  guilty, but there might be talk of accessory and all that. But if anybody broke  the Sixth Commandment, it was certainly Fairy Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly was,&rdquo; said Guy. And in  that grave speech was wiped out the last vestige of his love or respect for the  girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us forget her,&rdquo; said Sylvia,  softly, &ldquo;and remember only that she did not succeed in breaking up our family  circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Guy, with a quick  glance at her, &ldquo;she only welded it more firmly together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sylvia&rsquo;s smile at him showed  she understood.</p>
