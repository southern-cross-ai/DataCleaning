  &ldquo;WASTE&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p>Nickety Split bustled around his  store-house, flicked a duster here and there, straightened the door-mat, opened  the door and peeped out, although it was rather early for his little friends to  call. Many little feet had padded the well-worn track leading to Nickety  Split&rsquo;s. The store-house was small, a quaint little building of sticks and  stones; but what a wealth it contained! Over the doorway, picked out in  pebbles, were the words, &ldquo;The Rainy Day&rdquo;. Yes, it does sound queer; but the  bush creatures understood what the name meant.</p>
<p>Nickety Split was even quainter  than his store. Of course he was a goblin, otherwise he would never have  understood his little people. Long wispy hair fell over his spectacles; his  eyes peeped around corners in the most surprising way, while from the back of  his funny green coat hung a huge book and pencil. They were so large that with  every step he took a &ldquo;flip, flap,&rdquo; echoed around him. They were &ldquo;The Rainy Day&rdquo;  book and pencil. Nickety&rsquo;s shoes were much too large for him; but he tied them  on with grass, so what did it matter?</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page003a.jpg" alt="page3a" width="879" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get your hair  trimmed?&rdquo; Mr. Lyre Bird asked one day as he flaunted his beautiful tail for  Nickety to admire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want with trimmed hair?&rdquo;  Nickety replied. &ldquo;It would only grow again, and I&rsquo;d have to pay Willie Wagtail  to pull it out once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s sense in that,&rdquo; Mr.  Lyre Bird remarked, &ldquo;but are you sure you&rsquo;re not being mean?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page004.jpg" alt="page4" width="723" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; Nickety Split  replied. &ldquo;Willie Wagtail can pluck hair from the cow, and wool from the sheep  for his nest, so why should I pay him for a hair trim when there is no need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Nickety&rsquo;s friends came and  went, each with a little advice tucked away in its ears, for none could doubt  the wisdom of this strange little goblin.</p>
<p>Many, many years ago the bush folk  had been very sad. Their world had lost its sunshine. Day by day birds and  animals died. Even the bees ceased to work, and became so rare that the honey  almost vanished from the hives.</p>
<p>A wicked &ldquo;habit&rdquo; ruled the bush in  those days. Dressed in dirty rags, a horrible bat perched on her shoulder, long  bony fingers plucking each lovely flower from its stalk, she left a path of  desolation behind her. Her name was &ldquo;Waste.&rdquo; She jeered at the bees for working  so hard and laughed in a high cackle as each little worker came hurrying home  with his load of honey. &ldquo;He! he! he! You silly creatures,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;What  good is it to you? All working instead of lying asleep in the flowers. The  drones are the only sensible ones among you. See how they enjoy life.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page005.jpg" alt="jeered" width="784" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page003b.jpg" alt="page3b" width="552" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The bees took no heed of &ldquo;Waste&rdquo;  at first, and each day the drones gobbled up the honey in the hive, then flew  out to sleep in the beautiful sunshine. Gradually, however, the workers became  discontented and began to listen to &ldquo;Waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is quite right,&rdquo; they said,  &ldquo;we are foolish to work so hard. Let us all become drones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen Bee vainly tried to tell  them how wrong &ldquo;Waste&rdquo; was, but they would not listen to her advice.</p>
<p>Soon the flowers died, for the  bees refused to visit them and so germinate their seed, and then, saddest of all, the honey in the hives dwindled to almost nothing.  Thousands of bees died from starvation. Then winter came with her cold bitter  winds and drenching rains. Poor little bees. &ldquo;Alas, for listening to cruel  &lsquo;Waste&rsquo;,&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Now we have nothing to eat. Oh, that we had worked and  saved our honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely a handful of the little  creatures was left, and these sought vainly for the flowers to provide the  tiniest bit of pollen.</p>
<p>Farther away in the bush all was  silent. &ldquo;Waste&rdquo; had sown the seeds of want. There, where everything had once  been so gay and busy, not even a whisper could be heard. A tiny &rsquo;possum peeped  nervously from the branches of a tree, his eyes wide open with fright. Last  summer he had been so happy and noisy, playing games while gathering his food.  The kookaburras had laughed, the butcher birds had carolled, even the lazy  wombat had tried to gambol as he laid in his evening meal. Happiness reigned  until the day &ldquo;Waste&rdquo; came hobbling down the track. Catching sight of the  little &rsquo;possum collecting his meal she paused to watch him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You foolish animal,&rdquo; she croaked.  &ldquo;Why do you want to collect all that food? Leave it alone. Go and play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;this is for winter,&rdquo; the  &rsquo;possum replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid!&rdquo; &ldquo;Waste&rdquo; laughed.  &ldquo;Look at the thousands of nuts on the trees. There&rsquo;ll be plenty for you in the  winter time. Go and play while summer is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure?&rdquo; the little  &rsquo;possum asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; &ldquo;Waste&rdquo; laughed.  &ldquo;Mother Nature will never let you starve.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page006.jpg" alt="starve" width="531" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>So off scampered the &rsquo;possum. He  forgot that Mother Nature&rsquo;s bounty was ruled by seasons, and that thriftless  animals received no grace if her treasures were flung aside. All through the  summer the &rsquo;possums played in the trees, plucking the nuts and throwing them on  the ground. Some took root, but hundreds and hundreds decayed as they lay among  the dead leaves. The birds pecked the berries from the trees before they were  ripe, and whistled with delight as they fell to the ground. It was all so easy.  Wicked &ldquo;Waste&rdquo; pulled her, wretched garments closer around her body as the  first breath of winter approached, then went shuffling away farther north into  the sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do? We&rsquo;re so hungry,&rdquo; the animals  cried. &ldquo;Surely Mother Nature will never let us die!&rdquo; But Mother Nature was  helpless. She had given her &ldquo;all,&rdquo; and it had been wasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go and see the owl. He is  so wise and may be able to help us,&rdquo; a tiny bush mouse suggested.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page007.jpg" alt="owl" width="700" height="341"></p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be very angry with us,&rdquo;  whimpered the &rsquo;possum. &ldquo;He warned me one day when he caught me throwing nuts  away. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for wasting them,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was right,&rdquo; the wee mouse  replied. &ldquo;He told me that bad habits were easily acquired by foolish people and  animals; but how were we to know we were foolish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grasping this thread of hope the  little folk set off to find the owl. Some limped, some stumbled, while others  fell &mdash; they were so weak with hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owl! Owl! Kind old owl, where are  you?&rdquo; they cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the trouble about!&rdquo; a soft  voice asked from a tree stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! There you are!&rdquo; the animals  cried with delight. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to ask for your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you for some  time,&rdquo; the owl said seriously. &ldquo;I know what you want, but what can I do?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so wise,&rdquo; the wee mouse  replied, &ldquo;surely you can do something for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owl shook his head very  slowly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make the nuts ripen on the trees, or command the grass to  seed. I can&rsquo;t make the bushes produce the berries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all die if you don&rsquo;t do  something to help us,&rdquo; the &rsquo;possum pleaded, pressing his little paws together.  Again the old owl shook his head, while a tear trickled slowly down his beak.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page008.jpg" alt="pleaded" width="700" height="461"></p>
<p>&ldquo;A fool and his wealth are soon  parted,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come to you for a lecture,&rdquo;  the wee mouse piped shrilly. &ldquo;We know only too well how foolish we&rsquo;ve been, and  are ready to work once more. It&rsquo;s practical help we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; the owl exclaimed in  surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s all the help you  can give us, I must do something,&rdquo; the mouse retorted impatiently. &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;  he ordered in a loud squeak. He looked such a tiny mite, leading the tattered  band of animals and birds through the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage! Courage my friends,&rdquo; he  piped, scrambling ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h!&rdquo; he squeaked suddenly. &ldquo;Listen,  I hear something.&rdquo; The little cavalcade stood listening attentively. Away in  the distance someone was whistling merrily. The animals were astonished. The  bush had been silent so long. What could it mean?</p>
<p>Now the whistling came nearer, and  strangest of all a tiny voice echoed through the bush in song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it is bad old  &lsquo;Waste&rsquo; trying to trap us?&rdquo; the &rsquo;possum whispered with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; the mouse replied  excitedly. &ldquo;She would never sing a happy song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer came the voice.  &ldquo;Put a little bit away, for a rainy day.&rdquo; The words were quite distinct now,  then once again the whistling commenced.</p>
<p>Suddenly, around a bend of the  track the queerest little figure appeared. You who read this story will know  who it was; but imagine the surprise of the bush folk when they first caught  sight of &ldquo;Nickety Split.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! Hullo! What a queer mix-up  you look,&rdquo; Nickety remarked as he came forward.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page009.jpg" alt="queer" width="700" height="469"></p>
<p>The animals seemed to have lost  all power of speech, and could only stand and stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where do you think you&rsquo;re  going?&rdquo; Nickety asked cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look for &lsquo;Help&rsquo;,&rdquo; the wee  mouse squeaked, much to his own amazement; his voice seemed to be braver than  his tail, for that trembled horribly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish it would keep still,&rdquo; the  mouse muttered to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look for &lsquo;Help&rsquo;,&rdquo; Nickety  repeated. &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the trouble? You all look as though you&rsquo;ve been chased  by a dingo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse&mdash;far worse!&rdquo; the mouse  exclaimed. &ldquo;My poor friends are starving. We listened to &lsquo;Waste&rsquo; and threw our  winter food away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; Nickety made a  strange clucking noise in his throat. &ldquo;That is a serious matter. Sit down and  tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The animals and birds told their  sad story one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must be done for you,&rdquo;  Nickety said hastily. &ldquo;It is no use looking any further for &lsquo;Help.&rsquo; I passed  her on my way through the bush. She was in a great hurry, and very angry, I  thought.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she speak to you?&rdquo; the mouse  enquired anxiously. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Nickety said sorrowfully.  &ldquo;She passed with her head down, muttering something about &lsquo;foolish creatures.&rsquo;  But cheer up! We must all get to work and put matters right again. Come with  me, I&rsquo;ll take you to my home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are &lsquo;Help&rsquo; in  disguise,&rdquo; the wee mouse said</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am &lsquo;Thrift.&rsquo; That is my real  name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrift,&rdquo; the animals repeated one  to another. &ldquo;What a strange name.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, unfortunately, quite a  number of people don&rsquo;t like my name, so I found it better to change it,&rdquo;  Nickety answered. &ldquo;But what does it matter&mdash;as long as they are willing to do  business with me.&rdquo; Throwing back his head he broke into his song once more.  &ldquo;Put a little bit away, for a rainy day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a funny. song,&rdquo; the &rsquo;possum  remarked, running up to Nickety&rsquo;s side and placing his paw in the goblin&rsquo;s  hand. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very good song,&rdquo; Nickety  replied. &ldquo;If you little people had put a bit away for a rainy day you would not  be in want. You know it can&rsquo;t be sun-shiny always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Is that what it means!&rdquo; the  mouse exclaimed. &ldquo;The sunny days are those when we have plenty, and the rainy  days are those when we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Nickety said with  emphasis.</p>
<p>Along the bush track more animals  and birds joined the procession. Even the bees who were strong enough flew  overhead, buzzing gladly, until at last Nickety&rsquo;s quaint little house was  reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; he exclaimed, turning  around, &ldquo;where am I going to put you all?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page010.jpg" alt="you all" width="603" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Such an excited clamour arose.  Pushing and jostling, squawking and squeaking, the little folk tried to rush  inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, now, that won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;  Nickety reprimanded. &ldquo;Line up please, while I take your names and occupations.  No one enters my house until he promises to work and save. It does not matter  how small an amount you save; but everyone at the end of the day, must bring  something to store for future needs. No waste will be allowed. Now then! Names  please,&rdquo; and giving a big cough to add importance to his words, he produced the  &ldquo;Rainy Day&rdquo; book and pencil.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page011.jpg" alt="line up" width="700" height="413"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  &ldquo;Thrift&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You, Miss Bee, are you willing to  work and every evening bring your surplus honey for me to store in the &lsquo;Rainy  Day&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Indeed I am!&rdquo; Miss Bee  replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pass through the doorway and  have some honey to eat. You&rsquo;ll find I&rsquo;ve stored it on the top shelf. But first,  sign your name in the book, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a great ordeal for Miss  Bee. The pencil was so large; but she bravely made a tiny mark then passed into  the storehouse.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page012.jpg" alt="pen" width="700" height="607"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The next bee, please,&rdquo; Nickety  Split commanded. One by one they signed their names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the birds, he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caw! Caw!&rdquo; a large crow cried as  he came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you promise to bring all  your spare nails and bits of wire to the &lsquo;Rainy Day&rsquo;?&rdquo; Nickety asked sternly,  looking straight into the keen eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring keys, golf balls,  nails, wire, children&rsquo;s toys that have been left about, watches, spoons, pencils&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; Nickety shouted, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want you to steal. You must work honestly and save.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crow bowed his head, made an  untidy mark with the pencil and moved towards the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any grubs around,&rdquo; he  enquired, rather meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nickety replied. &ldquo;Look  under that large stone in the corner. Every evening I went through the bush  collecting what you threw away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the last animal had signed  its name, the &ldquo;Rainy Day&rdquo; book was almost full.</p>
<p>Inside, the storehouse was a  picture of activity, rather bewildering to anyone who chanced to peep in at  that moment. So many hungry animals and birds were feeding and chattering at  once; but a glance at the neatly arranged bundles and packages showed the work  of Nickety Split. Dried leaves and berries hung from the ceiling, nuts were  piled in a neat heap in a corner, yams and other roots tied together lay on the  shelves, beside a huge bowl of honey. Birds&rsquo; nests, which had been cast aside  as useless, had been carefully gathered and tenderly laid away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may need these some day,&rdquo; he  said to himself as he handled each one tenderly. Many tiny birds were thankful  to nestle down in one of the cosy nests that night. Some even recognised their  own cast-aways, and, filled with wonder and gratefulness, tucked their little  heads under their wings, cheeping softly as they fell asleep.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page013.jpg" alt="nests" width="683" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As winter passed away, &ldquo;The Rainy  Day&rdquo; became almost empty of its precious stores. The first warm morning was the  sign for all to be up and working, and dawn saw the little people start out on  their day&rsquo;s work. Evening was the time for all surplus food to be brought to  the store-house.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page018a.jpg" alt="started" width="571" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Nickety Split entered each item in  his &ldquo;Rainy Day&rdquo; book, crediting each worker with his belongings. Column after  column was filled daily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many nuts today?&rdquo; Nickety  asked the &rsquo;possum as he placed the bundle on the floor.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page014.jpg" alt="nuts" width="700" height="555"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Six,&rdquo; he replied, and bustled out  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many yams for you?&rdquo;  Nickety asked a wallaby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten, today, Sir,&rdquo; the wallaby  replied, pulling them out of her pouch, then hurriedly hopping away.</p>
<p>A glance inside the book showed  how saving each animal had become.</p>
<p>Miss Bee, No. 1. &hellip; 8 baskets of  pollen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Magpie &hellip; 2 pieces of meat  (one dried). </p>
<p>Mr. Mouse &hellip; 15 grains of wheat.</p>
<p>Miss Wagtail &hellip; 10 cows&rsquo; hairs  brown and white.</p>
<p>Mr. &rsquo;Possum &hellip; 30 nuts (assorted).</p>
<p>Mr. Galah &hellip; 6 grass seeds.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallaby &hellip; 10 yams (one  bruised).</p>
<p>As the weeks went by, &ldquo;The Rainy  Day&rdquo; became overcrowded, and Nickety spent quite a lot of time hunting around  for fresh corners in which to store the goods.</p>
<p>One morning he called a meeting  together. &ldquo;We must build a large store-house,&rsquo; he explained, &ldquo;and everyone who brings new treasures will receive an extra  one from me. Thrift deserves its reward.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page015a.jpg" alt="new" width="700" height="645"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; the little  creatures cried. &ldquo;Only a short time ago we had nothing, and now&mdash;look what we  have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us start building today,&rdquo;  Nickety said. &ldquo;Let us have plenty for the coming winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A suitable spot was chosen for the  new store-house, and the ants  were given the honour of laying the foundations. Thousands of thousands each  carrying a grain of sand, laid the flooring.  Then came the birds with twigs, while others brought mud. Nickety worked  like a giant patting the mud and sticks into place, until the walls were built.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page018b.jpg" alt="ants" width="700" height="345"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the windows and chimney,&rdquo;  he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; the crows and  magpies cried together, pointing to a pile of pebbles and broken glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought the door,&rdquo; Mrs. Rabbit  said, as she came puffing around the corner, her mouth full of dried grass.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page015b.jpg" alt="puffing" width="700" height="454"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; Nickety remarked.  &ldquo;Trust a rabbit to look after things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In no time &ldquo;The Rainy Day Branch&rdquo;  was finished, and then once more the bush folk set to work to fill it. Song and  whistling filled the air, Nickety at times singing his favourite song, until  the parrots came to know it and sang the words from the tree-tops as they  gathered the berries. The bush was now the happiest place. Mother Nature gave  her wonderful gifts, which each appreciated to the full, and guarded jealously.  And all had Nickety Split to thank&mdash;or was it &ldquo;Thrift&rdquo;? I really forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  &ldquo;Success&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p>A Stranger walked through the  bush, down the track that led to &ldquo;The Rainy Day&rdquo;. His head was lowered, his  eyes were sad. He walked slowly, thinking, thinking, too weary to lift his  tired feet until a bump halted his footsteps. Lifting his head sharply he came  out of his dreams, and stood staring in amazement at the little store-house.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page016.jpg" alt="stranger" width="851" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; he asked  aloud. &ldquo;There are no fairies in this world. Only cold facts. Surely I&rsquo;m  dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping ever so quietly towards  &ldquo;The Rainy Day&rdquo; he almost collided with Miss Wallaby as she bounded through the  doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Fairyland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; Miss Wallaby  answered hurriedly. &ldquo;Fairies only play; we work!&rdquo; and with a hop she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange, and stranger still,&rdquo; the  man whispered, approaching the doorway; then, noticing the sign over the  portal, laughed his loudest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be dreaming,&rdquo; he  cried.</p>
<p>Nickety peeped around the door, his  poor little heart thumping with fear. &ldquo;A man,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Oh, my poor  store-house. He will destroy it and all its treasures. My little friends will  never forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not harm you or your  little house,&rdquo; the man said in a soft voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Nickety asked  nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few moments of your precious  time&mdash;nothing more,&rdquo; the man replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very busy today. It&rsquo;s the day  we do most of our nut gathering. Could you call another time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the man said  sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for &lsquo;Help&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you need &lsquo;Help&rsquo;?&rdquo; Nickety  asked, astonished.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page017.jpg" alt="help" width="700" height="531"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;Can you  tell me where I can find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, &lsquo;Help&rsquo; never comes along  this way now,&rdquo; Nickety replied. &ldquo;We all work so hard to save our earnings that  we have no need for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! You are wise little folk,&rdquo;  the man sighed. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t my people like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps &lsquo;Waste&rsquo; has known them,&rdquo;  Nickety replied softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Waste&rsquo;&mdash;wicked &lsquo;Waste.&rsquo; What do  you know of her?&rdquo; The man looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come inside and I will tell you,&rdquo;  Nickety said, beckoning him to enter.</p>
<p>There the story of &ldquo;The Rainy Day&rdquo;  was told, and a man left with fresh hope in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely I can build a store-house  for my people,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;A place where they can save their money for which  they have laboured. A place to which they can turn on &lsquo;A Rainy Day&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many weeks went by. Over the  mountains, away from Nickety Split&rsquo;s store-house, a great stone building reared  its head skywards. The first Bank was in erection. Many months went by. People  hurried in and out of its huge door, leaving behind their surplus money to be  kept in safe keeping for times of stress. Many years went by. A wealthy city  grew, with happy inhabitants.</p>
<p>Children laughed as they played in  the parks and schools. Men and women sang at their work, for a good habit lived  amongst them. &quot;What was the habit?&rdquo; I hear you ask. &quot;Was it a Bank or  was it Thrift?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2301051h-images/page019.jpg" alt="bank" width="675" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>AND NOW:&mdash; </p>
<p>Nickety Split&rsquo;s timely lesson to  the &ldquo;birds and the bees, and all the tiny creatures that lived among the trees&rdquo;  was not wasted, for here you see them practising that other kind of thrift that  is made so easy for you.</p>
<p>At your School, too, there is  probably a School Bank, but if not there is a Branch or Agency of the  Commonwealth Savings Bank in your district. No matter where you live,  therefore, you can have your Savings Account too. Nickety made no charge for  helping the forest folk &mdash; instead he paid them interest, as you know, and that  is just what the Commonwealth Savings Bank does.</p>
<p>Remember the &ldquo;Rainy Day Store&rdquo;  which helped the bush folk so wonderfully. In just the same way, a Savings  Account will provide for your &ldquo;Rainy Day,&rdquo; as well as enable you to spend for  your comfort and happiness. </p>
