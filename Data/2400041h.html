  The New Home</b></h2>
<p>Though we did eat a lot of cake  and pumpkin-tart, and jump about and feel happy at Kate&rsquo;s wedding, we were down  hearted enough when she went away.</p>
<p>All morning we hung around waiting  for the parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope as you&rsquo;re going to a  good home, my girl,&rdquo; Mother said as they packed up, &ldquo;an&rsquo; that you&rsquo;ll both be &rsquo;appy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate murmured something, and then  they whimpered and wept a lot, and home was miserable and gloomy.</p>
<p>But Sandy was jolly enough. Sandy  was Kate&rsquo;s husband; and he didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;poor fellow!&mdash;what lay before him. He  whistled and hummed tunes as he bustled in and out with bundles to strap to the  saddles; and sometimes he broke out and sang in a loud, rasping voice to the  air of &ldquo;The Old Bullock Dray&rdquo;:</p>
<p class="note">Oh, we&rsquo;re off out selecting where  the gum trees grow&mdash;<br>
  Where the wallabies and &rsquo;possums will be all the go&mdash;<br>
  Oh, we&rsquo;ll all be pumpkin squatters in a year or so,<br>
With a cow to kill at Christmas where the gum trees grow!</p>
<p>When at last everything was ready  and Kate could find no excuse for staying any longer, she turned her big, red  eyes upon Mother and blubbered afresh. We trooped outside with lumps in our  throats and sat on the ground, our backs to the slabs, and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo-hoo! Boo-oo-hoo!&rdquo; from  inside.</p>
<p>We wished we had gone away somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be goo-goo-good t&rsquo; &rsquo;er,  Sandy?&rdquo; Mother sobbed.</p>
<p>Sandy said he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; m-m-make &rsquo;er &rsquo;ap-ap-py?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy promised.</p>
<p>Then there was loud kissing and  silent hand-shaking, and Kate, crying violently, passed out in charge of Sandy  and was put on her horse.</p>
<p>They started, and as they rode  slowly down the track we stood up and watched them and waved until the thick  timber closed behind them and they passed from our sight,</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s selection was on Sleepy  Creek, a hundred and sixty acre one. All beautiful land, too, Three acres of it  were cleared. Sandy was straggling hard to clear one more. The remaining  hundred and fifty-six were under scrub, prickly-pear, wallaby-bush and  Bathurst-burr.</p>
<p>There was a new house, built on  the premises, with four slabbed sides and a top, a place to get in at and two  small, square holes, one each side the door, to look out through. The whole was  guarded by a dandy-looking dog-leg fence, that kept everything off except  cattle, iguanas, kangaroo rats, snakes, and death adders. Inside, tidy and  natty. Curtains on the bed; a cloth on the table, the legs of which were  screwed into the earth; two gin cases that served as chairs wore crochet  coverings; while the holes in the floor, in and out of which snakes used to  chase mice, were covered with bags, and a heavy round block placed on them for  additional safety. A Christmas card, and a paper picture of Queen Victoria, and  another of Wellington at Waterloo with his legs torn off, decorated the walls.</p>
<p>No grass on the selection&mdash;not a blade,  not a root. The place was overstocked. Its carrying capacity was outraged. It  had been overstocked for fifty years. Sandy reckoned he had between two and  three million wallabies on it&mdash;not including kangaroo rats and bandicoots. The  total number of these he couldn&rsquo;t approximate. They were not abroad much in the  day, and Sandy didn&rsquo;t go out at night. Sandy was a good husband.</p>
<p>Sandy worked hard grubbing and  clearing timber those long, hot days; no one with him but the dog. The dog  always accompanied him. It never could think that Sandy was not on a plain, and  followed him about to get in the shade. In the cool of the evening Kate would  come out and lend a hand. She would take an axe and face Sandy across a big  log, and they would chop, chop, alternately at the same nick. When the log was  cut through Sandy would sit on it and take Kate on his knee and press his hairy  chin into the hollow of her cheek and ask her if she really, really loved him?  Sandy was a devoted husband.</p>
<p>Though no neighbours lived nearer  than five miles, Sandy and Kate never found the selection lonely. They had  plenty to occupy their minds with during the day; and at night, after supper,  they used to sit at the table and sing through several books of &ldquo;Australian  Melodies.&rdquo; When not in a mood for music, Sandy would go out and grope in the  dark for armfuls of stones and handy waddies, and stack them inside. Then he&rsquo;d  throw the door open, and, loaded heavily with missiles, Kate and he would wait  and watch. And when a kangaroo rat, or twenty kangaroo rats, hopped gallantly  along into the light, they would let fly&mdash;<i>bang!  bif!</i> It was a delightful pastime, and they indulged liberally in it until  late at night; but in the morning, what an accumulation of rubbish around the door!  Not many rats, though; thirty-three was the most ever they knocked in one  night.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page023.jpg" alt="sing" width="650" height="504"></h3>
<p>Sandy commenced breaking-up. The  first day he turned over half-an-acre; the second, none at all. For a week he  tramped the bush looking for the horses. The selection was fenced only on one  side, and they used to get out. It took him a long time to finish the four  acres. He was always searching for the horses, and when he did find them&mdash;which  was mostly at sundown&mdash; and put them in the paddock, they were gone again in the  morning.</p>
<p>Sandy sowed corn and fenced it in  with wire netting four feet high, which he was to pay for after the shelling.  He put a wire netting gate in it, fastened with a patent spring lock which the  storekeeper had recommended; and not a wallaby could get in. Just at the right  time it rained, and the corn shot up and grew till it was higher than the  netting. It was a picture! Sandy and Kate went to look at it every day. So did  the wallabies. They approached it at nightfall in all manner of ways &mdash; in long,  single file, in double file, in droves and right and left battalions. They  gathered round the netting, and panted and jostled each other like thirsty  sheep about a dam; and Sandy would smile complacently at them. Sometimes at  night he would stop singing and listen. &ldquo;Hear th&rsquo; devils?&rdquo; he would say to  Kate, and grin; then he would poke his head out the door and yell derisively. A  rush&mdash;a scampering through bushes, and cracking of dead sticks! And Sandy would  begin a new song.</p>
<p>But one night when he yelled there  was no response. Sandy listened. Not a wallaby was on the move, but he could  hear the corn leaves rasping and tearing violently. He listened again, and  looked desperately at Kate. Kate turned pale. Sandy rushed out and ran to the  gate. It was wide open. The waning moon threw a pallid light over the place.  Sandy stood. A dark mass of wallabies, like ten thousand head of sheep being  counted through a hurdle, were fighting for admission. They couldn&rsquo;t get in.  The corn paddock was full.</p>
<p>Sandy was a bad loser. He wrote a  letter to Dad with prickly pear juice, in which he moaned vehemently; and  Mother went over in the dray to console and encourage her son-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; she said to Kate, &ldquo;it  was a pity, but y&rsquo; should be thankful you&rsquo;ve got a good husband, my girl&mdash;no one  could want more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Kate answered,  belting into a tree with the axe, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one thing (<i>grunt</i>), Mother; we&rsquo;re both (<i>gasp</i>)  happy enough (<i>grunt, gasp</i>) anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  Twelve Months After</b></h2>
<p>Sandy and Kate had been just a  year on their selection&mdash;a year toiling amongst timber and stones and trees&mdash;a  year struggling and straining&mdash;a year hoping. And they might as well have sat  calmly down all the while, or remained in bed. They hadn&rsquo;t a chattel, scarcely,  to start with&mdash;nothing but an old cart, an improvised sledge for bringing water  on when the gully went dry, an axe, and a wooden plough which a pair of used-up  old mares (that no grass or grain or blue-metal or profanity could animate)  sometimes trailed about and scratched the ground with.</p>
<p>Sandy was a man of resolution; and  when he found things going against him he resolved to leave off. He left off  suddenly one day; reached down Kate&rsquo;s saddle from the cross-beam; heaped ashes  on the fire; filled a sack with an old rooster and a pair of lost-looking hens  that never laid, a bottle or two of honey, and some prickly-pear jam; fastened  the door with a chain; addressed a word of advice to the cat; looked round to  see nothing valuable was left lying about outside; then hoisted Kate on to one  of the old mares, and came to Shingle Hut and planted the poultry and the  strained honey and the jam cheerfully down at our door.</p>
<p>We nearly went off our heads. Dad  heard us rejoicing, and hurried from the paddock to greet Sandy and Kate. He  took charge of the old mares, unsaddled them and gave them each a pumpkin, and  couldn&rsquo;t work any more that day. Joe exploited the sack and turned the poultry  adrift, and rushed wildly round waving the honey and the prickly-pear jam  about, and said they were <i>his</i>. Kate  smiled and told Mother she could have brought ever so much more had she thought  we would have liked it. Joe sighed and inquired of Kate if she would be going  back <i>soon</i>. Joe longed to return with  her at once and stay a year.</p>
<p>We made much of Sandy and Kate&mdash;Dad  particularly. He urged them to make up their minds to stay altogether; but  Sandy wouldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Sleepy Creek&rsquo;s afore this,&rdquo; he used to say; and every day we  expected he would return&mdash;the very thought of his departure made us dull.</p>
<p>Several weeks went pleasantly by,  then a couple of months passed, and Sandy and Kate were still with us. They  spent their time hunting up old acquaintances, in our cart, and getting up  dances to which they invited the whole country side. And they shook young and  old by the hand when they were leaving, and made them promise to come to the  next dance.</p>
<p>Sandy and Kate talked of  organising a real big riding-party, to wind up with a dance at night. It must  have been a great success, only that Sal, one day, started grumbling, and said  she was tired of being made a slave and a washerwoman of, while other  people&mdash;meaning Sandy and Kate&mdash;trotted about enjoying themselves. Mother, too,  had to complain of the flour-bag going down in a month. Then Dad, who had grown  quite surly and uncommunicative since the riding-party had been mentioned, must  turn round one morning and curse Sandy because he was giving the old mares a  feed of corn. Dad asked Sandy if he meant to stay all his life living on him,  and spoilt everything.</p>
<p>Sandy didn&rsquo;t answer. His dignity  was insulted. He walked straight into the house. &ldquo;Get yer things,&rdquo; he said to  Kate, &ldquo;an&rsquo; get out o&rsquo; here! No more o&rsquo; this f&rsquo; <i>me!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a noise! Kate  cried; Mother sobbed and hung on to Sandy, and said she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.</p>
<p>Sal, weeping, went out to  conciliate Dad. Dad flung the harness on the ground and roared; &ldquo;Th&rsquo; devil take  th&rsquo; <i>lot</i> o&rsquo; y&rsquo;! Am I goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; work  here an&rsquo; run inter debt t&rsquo; keep rations in the place t&rsquo; feed <i>him</i> an&rsquo; <i>you</i> too? &ldquo;</p>
<p>Sal came in again.</p>
<p>All Mother&rsquo;s supplications were  lost on Sandy. He was determined to go. He saddled the old mares as fast as he  could, and when Kate was ready he lifted her on and went off without looking at  Dad.</p>
<p>Then Mother and Sal sat down and  cried some more.</p>
<p>But Sandy and Kate didn&rsquo;t go off  alone. Uncle Peter accompanied them. Said <i>he</i> wanted a change, too.</p>
<p>Near sunset. Sandy and Kate and  Uncle approaching the house; Sandy pointing out his boundary-line to Uncle and  scrutinising a lot of strange cattle round the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed, &ldquo;th&rsquo;  winder&rsquo;s open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who th&rsquo; devil&mdash;&rdquo; But Sandy  didn&rsquo;t finish. The cattle made off through the rails, which someone had left  down, and a bullock&rsquo;s head, with huge horns on it, poked itself suddenly out  the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m d&mdash;d!&rdquo; Sandy said,  coming to a dead stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bullick in the house!&rdquo; murmured  Kate, &ldquo;O dear! dear! dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only Uncle saw the humour of it.  Uncle had a keen sense of other people&rsquo;s humour. He chuckled and urged his old  horse towards the house.</p>
<p>As the party came near, the  bullock snorted and made several attempts to fall out, then withdrew his head  and sailed around inside and made a great noise. Sandy growled fiercely, and  Kate looked troubled.</p>
<p>Uncle explained cheerfully how the  animal got in. &ldquo;Some &rsquo;n&rsquo;s left the door wide open,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s mooched  in and shoved it shut on hisself. I see it done afore many a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy jumped down to let the brute  out. Kate stood off out of reach; while Uncle prowled to the back of the  building, and peeped through the cracks and talked soothingly to the bullock.</p>
<p>Sandy shoved the door in with a  pole and ran away. But the bullock didn&rsquo;t rush out&mdash;it rushed into the bedroom  and plunged about in there.</p>
<p>Uncle laughed and shifted to another  crack. He was laughing hard when all at once a crash came just at his crack,  and a lot of slabs fell out and silenced him. Then the bullock plunged through  the opening and galloped away with the bed-curtain on his horns.</p>
<p>Sandy lifted a heavy slab from  Uncle&rsquo;s chest, then looked inside. A great load was taken off his mind when he  found no evidence of the brute having been an occupant any length of time.</p>
<p>Uncle also looked in. <i>He</i> seemed disappointed. He looked coldly  at the interior as a prospective boarder at three guineas per week might have  viewed it; and said he couldn&rsquo;t see that the bullock had ill-used the <i>furniture</i> much, anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s smashed th&rsquo; <i>box</i>,&rdquo; Sandy said, contradicting him, and  proceeded to put the battered gin-case together again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t harm the <i>chairs</i> or th&rsquo; <i>pianner</i>&rdquo; Uncle went on; then, gloomily eyeing the walls and the  roof, in which there were some big holes: &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose y&rsquo; built this y&rsquo;self?&rdquo; But  Sandy wasn&rsquo;t given to &ldquo;blowing.&rdquo; He made no answer.</p>
<p>Kate flew round and prepared tea,  and when they had talked awhile she fished out some bags and a bundle of  kangaroo skins and made a comfortable bed for Uncle on the floor.</p>
<p>They turned in, and Uncle began to  cough violently, and in a load voice complained of a draught from the cracks,  and called out all night long about fleas, and every moment wished to Heaven  that morning would come. Uncle was an impatient man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Uncle and the &rsquo;Roos</b></h2>
<p>Next morning Sandy took Uncle over  the property, and showed him the plough, and the land he had cleared, and where  he was going to erect a barn and run a dividing fence, and pointed out holes  where the wallabies came through the palings round the bit of cultivation.</p>
<p>Uncle sat on a log and praised the  soil and the grass and the country generally, but shook his head in  condemnation of everything Sandy had been doing, and mapped out an elaborate  plan for the successful working of the place. &ldquo;That is, o&rsquo; course,&rdquo; he  concluded, &ldquo;if y&rsquo; expects me t&rsquo; remain an&rsquo; &rsquo;elp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy did. Sandy saw salvation in  Uncle. He was never so hopeful before. He could see his way clearly now. His  heart beat fast in the anticipation of the prosperity Uncle painted, and a new  colour came to his face.</p>
<p>They sauntered back to the house,  and Sandy spent the remainder of the day explaining the &ldquo;plans&rdquo; to Kate. &ldquo;No  doubt,&rdquo; he said exultingly, &ldquo;the old chap&rsquo;s got a head on &rsquo;im!&rdquo; Large tears  came into Kate&rsquo;s eyes. Pride of relationship to Uncle brought them.</p>
<p>A cold day. Sandy rolling big logs  together, burning off; Kate humping water from the gully in a bucket; Uncle  busy in the house, hammering things. He nailed a piece of tin over a crack near  the head of his bed; then rolled a big stone in near the fire and sat on it to  read a newspaper.</p>
<p>A mob of hunted kangaroos bounded  past and jumped the wire fence&mdash;all  but one, a fair-sized thing, that got fast and hung by the toes, kicking and  rattling the wire.</p>
<p>Kate put down the bucket and  called excitedly to Sandy, who ran up and secured the prize. Dead &rsquo;roos were  common enough, but seldom was a live one thrown in Sandy&rsquo;s way. He held it by  the tail and entertained himself by making it spring towards Kate, who squealed  and dodged behind trees.</p>
<p>Presently he got tired, and paused  to consider what to do with the brute.</p>
<p>A bright idea occurred to him. &ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; he said; his face lighting up. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; and he forced the animal  before him and shoved it into the house, grinning when it dashed behind the  fire and startled Uncle. Uncle &ldquo;shooed&rdquo; it with the newspaper and fell off the  stone; then he swore.</p>
<p>Sandy took the marsupial in his  big arms and threw it on its back. Then, turning to Kate: &ldquo;Bring an old pair o&rsquo;  my trousers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate eagerly searched the bedroom,  and returned giggling and holding out a garment that wasn&rsquo;t Sandy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Sandy ejaculated; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  a <i>doe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate threatened to squeal herself  ill. The &rsquo;roo struggled. Sandy punched it.</p>
<p>Uncle began to appreciate Sandy&rsquo;s  idea. He joined in and helped to dress the &rsquo;roo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said Sandy, fastening  the garment round the animal&rsquo;s waist with greenhide, &ldquo;Have y&rsquo; an ol&rsquo; jacket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate produced a red one. Sandy  grinned approval and pulled the jacket on the &rsquo;roo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring th&rsquo; sheep bell (<i>you</i> cow, <i>stand!</i>) I foun&rsquo; th&rsquo; other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate brought the bell, while Uncle  chuckled cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;er up!&rdquo; Sandy cried,  throwing wide the door; and away went the &rsquo;roo.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, &ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere!&rdquo;  Sandy yelled.</p>
<p>Kate and Uncle bolted out. The  bush was fairly alive with marsupial&mdash;hundreds and hundreds of them, all bearing  down upon the house, bounding along as though a pack of dogs or the devil  himself were at their heels. But it was only the one in Kate&rsquo;s clothes they  were flying from, and the brute was in distress. It floundered badly, half a  mile behind, tinkling the sheep bell all the time.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page036.jpg" alt="roo" width="650" height="464"></h3>
<p>Sandy danced with joy, and yelled  words of encouragement to it as it followed in pursuit</p>
<p>It was days before those kangaroos  settled down, and when they did they came back to Sandy&rsquo;s ground; and there  wasn&rsquo;t a blade of his grass they didn&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>Sandy was making but little  headway with the clearing; &rsquo;twas all heavy timber; and, so far, Uncle hadn&rsquo;t  been able to render any assistance. Uncle was busy in the house building a  sofa. He had been more than a month building the sofa.</p>
<p>Sandy saw an advertisement in a  newspaper offering big prices for kangaroo skins, and used to knock off early  every afternoon and prowl about firing the gun at the brutes.</p>
<p>Two gigantic &ldquo;old men&rdquo; that were  always there engaged Sandy&rsquo;s particular attention. He longed to have their  hides, but never could get a shot at them.</p>
<p>He discussed the matter with Uncle  one night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go near them any more,&rdquo;  said Uncle, &ldquo;leave it to me; <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> get  them.&rdquo; Sandy complied. He reckoned it was all over with the &ldquo;old men.&rdquo; Sandy  shared Kate&rsquo;s belief in Uncle.</p>
<p>For days Uncle neglected the sofa,  and spent his time constructing a cow out of hide and straw and pieces of pine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; he said to Sandy one  evening, after explaining the works of the animal to him&mdash;particularly of its  head, which he manipulated with a piece of rope, &ldquo;You take y&rsquo; gun an&rsquo; be th&rsquo;  front legs&mdash;I&rsquo;m th&rsquo; hind ones&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll swing th&rsquo; tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned, and disappeared  from his hips up inside the &ldquo;cow.&rdquo; Uncle followed suit, and the cow&mdash;a clumsy,  ill-shaped, ugly-looking brute, high in the front, blundered off up the  paddock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold a minute,&rdquo; said Uncle,  breathing fast, and the rear of the cow rested, while her front part elevated  itself like an elephant with its toes on a tub.</p>
<p>The animal staggered on again for  about a mile, then stopped suddenly. &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; Sandy whispered,  clutching the gun, &ldquo;feedin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then it was that Uncle&rsquo;s genius revealed itself. &ldquo;Down  with y&rsquo;r &rsquo;ead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; feed round about a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy bent his back and worked the  rope&mdash;and the cow fed. Then Uncle put his hand out of a hole and she switched  her tail.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;old men&rdquo; straightened up and  stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a bit further,&rdquo; said Uncle &mdash; &ldquo;quietly!&rdquo;  And the &ldquo;cow&rdquo; sauntered along as though the herbage wasn&rsquo;t to her taste. All at  once there were sounds of galloping hoofs and breaking timber. &ldquo;Holy!&rdquo; Sandy  muttered&mdash; &ldquo;<i>Cattle!</i>&rdquo; and tried to look  round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;<i>S all right</i>,&rdquo; Uncle said, &ldquo;&rsquo;s all right, ain&rsquo;t we <i>one</i> of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were station cattle that for  some time had been staring at the cow. They followed her cautiously till at  last, overcome with curiosity, they came with a rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They there yet?&rdquo; Uncle whispered  (meaning the game).</p>
<p>But Sandy was dumb. His attention  was all on the cattle. Sandy understood the ways of cattle.</p>
<p>They increased in number and  careered around making a dreadful noise. They displayed a friendly interest in  the &ldquo;cow,&rdquo; and approached her closely and smelt her, and sprang back when she  swore or switched her tail, till at last, when she refused to fraternise with  them and sidled away to the foot of a tree, they shoved her about and her hind  legs crossed, and she sat down. Then a heifer, that stood off throwing lumps of  earth over its back, suddenly rushed in with a prolonged bellow, and ripped her  horns into the &ldquo;cow&rdquo; and knocked her down. Sandy and Uncle struggled out and  made off different ways; and the heifer and the whole mob took fright and  fled&mdash;so did the &ldquo;old men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> God!&rdquo; Uncle gasped, and sank in a heap at the foot of a tree,  where he pressed his hands hard against his sides and coughed, and coughed, and  coughed.</p>
<p>Uncle always said that day had  made him feel an old man before his time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Sandy&rsquo;s Gold Mine</b></h2>
<p>From eight acres of wheat, that  Sandy had struggled hard for half a year to put in, he got a couple of bags of  flour and some pollard, and was thankful. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; like!&rdquo; he said jubilantly,  raking out a fistful for Kate to admire&mdash; &ldquo;None o&rsquo; y&rsquo;r dirt in that; that is  flour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two bags of flour was not a rich  reward for half a year&rsquo;s toil&mdash; nothing to boast about&mdash;nothing to make an  ordinary person rejoice wildly. But Sandy was no ordinary person.</p>
<p>The returns didn&rsquo;t satisfy Uncle,  though. <i>He</i> was disappointed, and lost  faith in the producing powers of Sandy&rsquo;s soil. Where crops were concerned Uncle  was a pessimist; he discredited farming altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; he grunted, in answer to  Tom Clatty, who was taking cattle down the creek; &ldquo;<i>he</i> med nothing&mdash;nothink on&rsquo;y a bag or two o&rsquo; flour thet he&rsquo;s stuck  in there takin&rsquo; all th&rsquo; room o&rsquo; th&rsquo; &rsquo;ouse up&mdash;lookin&rsquo; an&rsquo; starin&rsquo; at &rsquo;em ev&rsquo;ry  night as though they were alive! He <i>mighter</i> done though, hed he took <i>my</i> advice at  the start an&rsquo; let <i>thet</i> alone&rdquo; (Uncle  swung his right hand in contemptuous condemnation of the eight acres of  cultivation) &ldquo;an&rsquo; cleared &rsquo;ere&rdquo; (swinging his other hand, and indicating the  high part of the paddock, where stones and rocks were most and biggest, and the  timber and trees so heavy that there wasn&rsquo;t room for a hen to lay) &ldquo;but no!&rdquo;  (Uncle made an ugly grimace and held up both hands) &ldquo;&rsquo;e must <i>listen</i> to &rsquo;<i>er!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said &ldquo;Good-day&rdquo; to Clatty,  who smiled; and went off to a &ldquo;nest&rdquo; he had made for himself in the paddock&mdash;a  shady, secluded retreat commanding a view of the cultivation, and Sandy rolling  and tumbling about in it behind the two horses and the cranky old plough&mdash;to  study a greasy, torn, water-stained copy of Queensland <i>Hansard</i>. The date of it was washed out, but it must have been  nearly as ancient as some of the arguments it contained.</p>
<p>Uncle pored over that <i>Hansard</i> till near dinner-time, then  crawled out, and, shaking off the dry leaves that clung to his clothes,  strutted across to Sandy with the publication in his hand. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; in this,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;ll open yer eyes.&rdquo; Sandy called &ldquo;<i>Waay-h</i>&rdquo;  to the horses, and they broke into a canter. Down went the plough handles, and  Sandy brought the pair on to their rumps with a furious haul of the reins. &ldquo;Waay,  then, <i>will yer</i>&mdash;y&rsquo; mad, rushin&rsquo; dorgs! <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> stop yer gallop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black mare was all a-tremble,  and seemed undecided. Sandy watched her a moment, then swore and smacked her  hard with a rein to make her stand. Then both took fright, and plunged and  swung suddenly round, and fouled Uncle (who was standing by waiting a chance to  spell out <i>Hansard</i>), and knocked him  down and trampled him under.</p>
<p>When he got free of their feet and  found his own, he called Sandy a fool, and limped away in a temper. He  returned, though, when the animals were unyoked, and seating himself on the  beam of the plough, produced <i>Hansard</i> again.</p>
<p>Sandy prepared to listen; he  rubbed the perspiration from his face with the palm of his hand, leaving large  dirt smudges in its place, and sat beside Uncle, and stared over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen &rsquo;ere!&rdquo;&mdash;and Uncle in a  sharp, shrill voice read a portion of the Premier&rsquo;s speech, which said &ldquo;the  Government is offering a bonus of a thousand pounds to any person discovering  in Queensland a new payable gold mine.&rdquo; He paused, and looked meaningly at  Sandy.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s eyes fairly caught fire. &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, &ldquo;a thousan&rsquo; poun&rsquo;!&rdquo;&mdash;and reached for the <i>Hansard</i>.</p>
<p>But Uncle hadn&rsquo;t finished. &ldquo;A  bonus of one thousand pounds,&rdquo; he read again, &ldquo;to any person discovering in  Queensland a new payable gold mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy turned his head, and his  eyes settled on the mountain at the back of his paddock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all gold-bearing country,&rdquo;  Uncle said, guessing what was passing in Sandy&rsquo;s mind&mdash; &ldquo;every blessed inch of  it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; And Sandy&rsquo;s month  opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Know</i> it!&rdquo; Uncle replied; &ldquo;know it for certant. Why, look &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; (he  rose and hobbled away, returning with a huge lump of useless-looking metal,  which he threw down at Sandy&rsquo;s feet), &ldquo;there&rsquo;s gold in <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Specks of some bright substance or  other sparkled on its surface. Sandy stared at the specks and couldn&rsquo;t speak;  he seemed transfixed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in payable quantities, o&rsquo;  course,&rdquo; Uncle went on; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s the gold, and,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s lots of  it round &rsquo;ere&mdash;<i>heaps</i> of it; only wants  workin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all quite clear to Sandy,  and he sat mentally combating a resolution he had made only three days before  when Kate lost patience with him and told him to decide what he meant to  do&mdash;work his own land as it should be worked, and leave off tearing about after  kangaroos and bees&rsquo; nests and things, or stay inside altogether and do the  housework and let her go out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me th&rsquo; spade a moment!&rdquo; And  Uncle took the implement from the plough and went off with it on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Just then Kate cooeed, and Sandy  went off to dinner, thinking as he walked along. A year had made a great  difference in Kate. Her nature was changed. Degeneration had set in; she  regarded life seriously now, and nagged steadily at Sandy from the moment he  opened his eyes in the morning till it was time to &ldquo;turn in&rdquo; at night. Sandy  was never out of her mind; all her thoughts were for him. A constant little  wife Kate was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s th&rsquo; horses been going  ter-day?&rdquo; she inquired, pouring out the tea as Sandy trudged in. Sandy was  pondering heavily, wondering how to open the subject of gold mining to her, and  failed to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are y&rsquo; <i>deaf?</i>&rdquo; Kate squealed. Sandy looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are they goin&rsquo;&mdash;th&rsquo; <i>horses?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! rushin&rsquo; terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, could&rsquo;n&rsquo; y&rsquo; say s&rsquo;, &rsquo;stead  o&rsquo; standin&rsquo; mopin&rsquo; there like a sick owl!&rdquo; And Kate bounced across to the  fireplace.</p>
<p>Sandy made no reply. He sat down  cautiously and began on the &rsquo;roo tail soup. Kate took her seat at the end of  the table, frowning deeply.</p>
<p>There was a dead silence.</p>
<p>Suddenly Kate dropped the sugar  tin, scrambled to her feet, snatched up a bundle of bushes, comprising the  broom, and struck the kangaroo dog across the spine with it, just when the  hound was successfully manoeuvring a bone from the pot boiling on the fire; and  squealed: &ldquo;Out of this, y&rsquo; brute&mdash;<i>yer</i> rubbish: it&rsquo;s all yer good f&rsquo;&mdash;all y&rsquo; was ever <i>learned</i> t&rsquo; be good fer&mdash;<i>hook!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy felt it wasn&rsquo;t all meant for  the dog, and wished the brute had gone away somewhere and got poisoned.</p>
<p>Still he said nothing. Sandy wasn&rsquo;t  a warlike person. He kept on at the soup, and when he had finished smacked his  lips and murmured: &ldquo;Real good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a wise observation, for if  there was anything Kate was proud of at all it was her cooking. Most women <i>are</i>&mdash;even those who can&rsquo;t cook a chop.  The frown vanished from her face, and she looked pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made y&rsquo; a meat and gravy  puddin&rsquo;, too,&rdquo; she said, enthusiastically displaying her dainty in a tin.</p>
<p>Sandy stared at it in surprise,  then smiled on Kate, and looked just as he did the day he got married.</p>
<p>Silence again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo; y&rsquo; think,&rdquo; said Sandy,  coming to the point, &ldquo;but y&rsquo; better not say ennerthin&rsquo; about it yet awhile, ol&rsquo;  girl.&rdquo; He leaned over confidentially.</p>
<p>It was Kate&rsquo;s turn to appear  surprised, and her big eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s <i>gold</i> near the mountain,&rdquo; Sandy whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gold?</i>&rdquo; and Kate screwed her eyebrows about, and stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ve b&rsquo;lieved it,  meself, but it&rsquo;s there; the old chap <i>found</i> it&mdash;dashed if he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate thought hard for a few  seconds, while the frown returned to her face again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he read that t&rsquo; y&rsquo;?&rdquo; Sandy  drawled, &ldquo;that in th&rsquo; paper this mornin&rsquo; about a thousan&rsquo; poun&rsquo; t&rsquo; be given t&rsquo;  th&rsquo; cove finding gold in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Kate blurted out; &ldquo;do y&rsquo;  believe <i>that?</i>&rdquo; and she bounced from  the table in disgust, and knocked over the pudding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  Trouble on the Mine</b></h2>
<p>All that day Uncle was hard at  work, and at night he came in with mystery oozing out all over him, and refused  to utter a word. But next morning, while Sandy and Kate were at breakfast,  there was a noise at the door like a tip-dray emptying itself of gravel, and  Uncle marched in, puffing and brushing dust and scraps of rotten rock from his  sleeves and arms with the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a look at these,&rdquo; he said  invitingly to Sandy, and the big dupe jumped up and followed him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Uncle, foraging among  the pile of decayed stone he had deposited at the door, &ldquo;see that!&rdquo; (pointing  to something that glistened in the rubbish) &ldquo;look!&rdquo; (tossing the stuff about), &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  gold all through it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy couldn&rsquo;t find language to  express his astonishment. He had never seen gold in the raw before. He called  Kate.</p>
<p>Kate ignored him.</p>
<p>Sandy put his head in at the door  and implored her to &ldquo;just come an &rsquo;ave a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came at last, reluctantly, and  was sullen and suspicious-looking. Her eyes rested on the pile of &ldquo;specimens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is <i>that</i> y&rsquo;r gold,&rdquo; she said disdainfully, &ldquo;<i>that?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle straightened himself up and  gazed at her like one who had been hit hard with something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Kate hissed, &ldquo;<i>mud!</i>&rdquo; and tossed her head and went inside  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; Uncle said,  ironically. &ldquo;I <i>expected</i> as much,&rdquo;  looking at Sandy; &ldquo;she never saw a sign of gold in her life, knows simply  nothink about it, no more &rsquo;n you do, an&rsquo; hear what she sez!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle had gathered up the  specimens, when a policeman and a warder from the asylum rode up and asked  questions about an escaped lunatic they were in search of&mdash;&ldquo;a fellow,&rdquo; they  said, &ldquo;that talked religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Sandy nor Uncle had seen  anyone about answering the description, and both shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he does happen to come  this way,&rdquo; the policeman said, riding off again, &ldquo;watch him, because he&rsquo;s a bit  dangerous.&rdquo; Uncle chuckled. He had no fear of lunatics; no fear of any-thing&mdash;so  he said.</p>
<p>A week later Uncle and Sandy were  sinking a shaft at the bottom of the mountain. It was down about thirty feet,  and they had just returned from dinner.</p>
<p>Sandy was preparing to descend.  Sandy did all the descending&mdash;all the digging, too. Uncle was director, and had  charge of the windlass and <i>Hansard</i>.  And whenever Sandy swore loud enough to attract his attention he wound up the  bucket, and sometimes let it run down again before he emptied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I fix this,&rdquo; Sandy said  (adjusting a bandage that covered a wound on the back of his head, made by a  pick Uncle let fall on him), then took hold of the bucket. &ldquo;Sure y&rsquo; can steady  &rsquo;er?&rdquo; he murmured, hesitating at the brink.</p>
<p>Sandy was losing confidence in  Uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Uncle answered,  struggling with the cranky windlass&mdash; &ldquo;Wot y&rsquo; fritent o&rsquo;, man; lower <i>two</i> like y&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The windlass creaked, the bucket  began to descend, and Sandy&rsquo;s head had just disappeared when a wild-looking man  stepped out from amongst some bushes and walked straight for Uncle, pointing a  gun at him and calling out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deliver thyself; put thy hands up!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page051.jpg" alt="deliver" width="559" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Uncle got a shock. For a moment he  seemed dazed, but his understanding soon returned, and then up went both hands  (Uncle wasn&rsquo;t afraid), round went the windlass, and the handle struck him in  the chest and knocked him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h! <i>you</i> cow!&rdquo; in muffled tones came from the bottom of the well.</p>
<p>Like John the Baptist, the  wild-looking man was scarce of raiment, and appeared as though he had subsisted  for some time on grasshoppers and honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the eye of the  Lord is upon them that fear him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle, who had regained his feet,  remembered the policeman&rsquo;s warning, and his teeth chattered. Uncle wasn&rsquo;t a  coward; but, somehow, he always left his bravery in the pocket of his other  clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deliver thy watch, shivering  sinner! and thy purse.&rdquo; And the pious bushranger poked the muzzle of the gun  into Uncle&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Uncle closed his eyes. (He wasn&rsquo;t  afraid.) &ldquo;For the love of God, man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Liar!</i>&rdquo; shouted the lunatic, glaring along the barrel of the gun.</p>
<p>Groans, intermingled with threats  and bad language, came from the bottom of the shaft. The crank lowered his  weapon, and, leaning over, peered into the hole. Some more groans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infamous dog!&rdquo; he shouted down;  then, seizing the windlass, he wound up the bucket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Enter!</i>&rdquo; he said peremptorily to Uncle, and pointed to the dangling  vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh-h</i>&mdash;no&mdash;<i>mercy!</i> &mdash;<i>my</i> God!&rdquo; Uncle moaned; &ldquo;not down <i>there?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Takest thou <i>my</i> name in vain?&rdquo; And the lunatic, using one hand, again took aim  at Uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Enter</i>, sinner!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>Uncle nearly fell down the hole  scrambling to seat himself in the bucket, and when he was all in the lunatic  yelled &ldquo;<i>Infidel!</i>&rdquo;&mdash; and let the handle  go.</p>
<p>The windlass <i>did</i> rattle round! There was a great row at the bottom. Sandy took  offence at Uncle for descending without giving him any warning, and fell on him  and threatened to heave him to the top again. Sandy didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>The lunatic listened with his ear  over the well for a moment or two, then spoke solemnly into it. &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; he  began, &ldquo;I say unto thee, thou shalt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a voice  behind, and looking round, saw old Hawkins and his two sons approaching. They  were out kangarooing. &ldquo;Devils!&rdquo; he ejaculated, and, bounding up, fled for the  mountain.</p>
<p>The Hawkinses rescued Sandy and  Uncle from the well. There was a lot of blood on Sandy when he came to the top,  and he was in a bad humour. &ldquo;Enough gold-mining for me!&rdquo; he said sulkily, and  pulled on his coat and went silently homeward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  Two Cases for the Doctor</b></h2>
<p>Sandy behind the plough again.  Uncle invalided&mdash;moping at the house with a heavy, thick muffler round his neck,  coughing and complaining of cold and a sore lip. He had complained of a sore  lip on and off for months. The pain was getting unbearable, he said, and  declared he would have to go to the hospital or see a doctor about it.</p>
<p>Kate wished to heavens he <i>would</i>&mdash;go anywhere so long as he didn&rsquo;t  return any more. She had come to regard Uncle as a nuisance, and a serious  hindrance to Sandy. Women are so changeable. Not so Sandy, himself; <i>he</i> had no desire to lose Uncle. The  bonds of kinship were still strong; besides, Sandy was forgiving and  sympathetic. He took Uncle in hand and patched him up&mdash;bathed and poulticed the  afflicted part, and sat up late in the night humouring and keeping him company.</p>
<p>One evening Sandy applied a little  &ldquo;farmers&rsquo; friend&rdquo; to Uncle&rsquo;s lip to relieve the pain, and for five or six  minutes you would have thought a snake was coiled round Uncle&rsquo;s leg. He danced  about the room with his hand over his mouth, only removing it to swear and  shout for water.</p>
<p>Both kerosene tins were empty, and  Uncle kicked one against the slabs and the other he sent flying close to Kate&rsquo;s  head. Then he bolted out the door and made for the gully.</p>
<p>Sandy stared aghast for several  moments, his big heart heaving with concern and compassion; then he turned to  Kate and, with pathos in his voice, asked her not to laugh.</p>
<p>Uncle got worse every day, till at  last there was scarcely any living in the house with him.</p>
<p>One evening Sandy heard that Dr.  Anderson was setting a limb for Morrissey, three miles down the creek. He  jumped on one of the old mares and rode down to Morrissey&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>On his way home Dr. Anderson  called at Sandy&rsquo;s selection and overhauled Uncle. A nice man was Dr.  Anderson&mdash;or Kate reckoned he was, anyway. He shook hands with Kate. He had the  name of being clever, too. Everyone on the creek said he was, and there must  have been eight or nine living there altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cancer!</i>&rdquo; he said, after a careful examination of Uncle&rsquo;s lip&mdash;&ldquo;have  to be cut out!&rdquo; And his big, sympathetic eyes looked steadily into Uncle&rsquo;s  little grey ones through a pair of gold-rimmed spec&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Uncle never flinched</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be rather painful,&rdquo; the  doctor explained, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll have to put you under chloroform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle flinched then, and became  apprehensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; do it <i>without</i> chloroform?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>The doctor said he could&mdash;would  rather do it so, in fact, if Uncle thought he could stand it.</p>
<p>Uncle never displayed such a nerve  before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand it all right,&rdquo; he said,  seating himself on a box and inviting the doctor to begin at once.</p>
<p>The latter smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here to-morrow,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;meanwhile your son here&rdquo; (meaning Sandy, who stood gloomily by), &ldquo;if he has a  razor, might shave your lip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy <i>had</i> a razor. An heirloom. It was frequently used for shaving  greenhide. And when the doctor came again Uncle&rsquo;s top lip&mdash;a long, thin one that  hung like a board in a calf&rsquo;s nose &mdash;was scraped as bare as a boot.</p>
<p>Everything was ready for the  operation. Kate provided warm water and cloths; Sandy left the plough to come  in and look on, and Uncle submitted himself bravely.</p>
<p>The doctor took his coat off, and  Sandy groaned. The doctor fossicked in a leather bag, and produced a pair of  bright scissors, which he carefully wiped. Uncle turned very white, but kept  calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, put your lip out!&rdquo; said the  doctor.</p>
<p>Uncle contorted his features till  his lip projected like the peak on a policeman&rsquo;s cap. Then the doctor pushed  back his white stiff cuffs, reached out, and, like clipping a piece of  cardboard, snipped a V-shaped piece from Uncle&rsquo;s lip.</p>
<p>Uncle clenched his fists and  quivered all over. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Briton,&rdquo; the medico said; &ldquo;did it hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not &rsquo;utch,&rdquo; Uncle answered, large  tears rushing from his eyes.</p>
<p>The wound was bathed and patched  with sticking-plaster, and the rest of the day Uncle lay on the sofa,  reflecting on his fate and the uselessness of life generally.</p>
<p>In four days Dr. Anderson called  again and cheerfully examined the patient. The sticking-plaster, he found, had  mostly left the lip&mdash;poked off by the stubble that had grown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have another shave,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;or the plaster will never stick. I&rsquo;ll be back again in about two hours.&rdquo;  And he prepared to depart.</p>
<p>Tears came into Uncle&rsquo;s eyes as he  shifted restlessly on the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to shave me?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>he</i> can do it again,&rdquo; the doctor replied, nodding towards Sandy.</p>
<p>Uncle turned his head as slowly as  a wounded bear might, and rested his eyes full on Sandy, who stood motionless  at the fireplace, looking the very temple of tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; he said in a firm  voice, &ldquo;<i>I want chloroform</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A glorious day. There had been  heavy rain on the creek, and the air was crisp and clear. No haze hung round  the mountains; everything bright and cheerful; the Bush was at its best.</p>
<p>Uncle was about&mdash;quite  recovered&mdash;quite himself again. All his uselessness and inactivity had returned.</p>
<p>Sandy was opening the last land.  He had just erected a stake with paper fastened to the head of it&mdash;a mark to go  by, and was jumping the plough into line when his eye rested on a flag in the  shape of a white skirt flying at the humpy.</p>
<p>Sandy flung the plough down, and,  regardless of the horses, tore over the ploughed ground, and was at the humpy  in a few bounds.</p>
<p>He rushed from it again and raced  wildly round in search of Uncle. Uncle was in his &ldquo;nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle only caught the first words  of what Sandy said. But he heard enough. He raised himself quickly and stared  in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! here! no! Send <i>me</i>. Let <i>me</i> go!&rdquo; he shouted after Sandy, as the latter raced back to the  plough.</p>
<p>Sandy threw the harness from the  horses; dragged the mare after him and shoved her into an old spring-cart,  housed under a tree at the back of the humpy; then, jumping in, recklessly  rattled down the creek at the risk of breaking his neck.</p>
<p>Uncle stared after Sandy till he  became restless, then walked about, now and again pausing to glance at the  deserted humpy, where the white skirt was still flying.</p>
<p>Uncle was agitated.</p>
<p>An hour passed. Still Uncle walked  up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Confound</i> it!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;what th&rsquo; devil did he want leaving <i>me</i> here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought he heard his name  called. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; and he looked up and listened. But it was only his  imagination.</p>
<p>Another hour nearly spent. Uncle  became remorseful. He reproached himself. &ldquo;Wot th&rsquo; devil did I want comin&rsquo; &rsquo;ere  at all, for?&rdquo; he whined; then lost himself in reverie.</p>
<p>When he woke up, and looked round  again, the horse, and cart were standing before the humpy. Sandy was there,  too&mdash; hurrying big Mrs. McNevin and a calico bundle indoors. Uncle <i>was</i> relieved!</p>
<p>Presently Sandy sauntered towards  Uncle. When half-way he stood and leaned on the fence. He looked lost.</p>
<p>Uncle approached him. &ldquo;<i>Well?</i>&rdquo; he whispered, apprehensively.</p>
<p>Sandy did not answer. His face was  grave; a heavy load seemed to be on his mind. He sighed audibly.</p>
<p>Then Uncle, too, leaned on the  fence and both were silent, motionless, till Mrs. McNevin showed herself. &ldquo;Come,  Sondy, mon,&rdquo; she called lustily. &ldquo;Come an&rsquo; see yeer bairn; d&rsquo; ye nae hear the squeals  o&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy gave a bound, and could  scarcely keep his feet in the haste he made to reach the humpy.</p>
<p>Uncle left next day. He wouldn&rsquo;t  stay any longer on Sandy&rsquo;s selection. Uncle couldn&rsquo;t stand excitement&mdash;or a baby  in the house. That was why he never got married&mdash;so he told Sandy and Mrs.  McNevin.</p>

  Some Neighbours of Sandy&rsquo;s</b></h2>
<p>The Taltys lived on the Station  road&mdash;three boys and three girls and the &ldquo;old man and woman.&rdquo; A well-grown  family they were, healthy and strong as horses. They took great care of their  strength, too&mdash;they rarely used any of it.</p>
<p>They were easy-going and never  complained; they seemed to have no trials, no cares, nothing to worry about.  They had nothing much to wear about, either.</p>
<p>Talty&rsquo;s selection wasn&rsquo;t one of  the smiling order. No money was wasted on it; no unnecessary buildings, no  wire-netting fences, no ornamental trees, no drays or carts, no machinery, and  no old iron lying about rusting in the sun. There was no visible extravagance  of any kind.</p>
<p>The house opened into a garden  fenced with sticks and filled with a rose-bush, a currajong tree and a  waterhole. It was without a chimney and without a tank. It leaned on an acre or  two of cleared ground ornamented with burnt holes, ash-patches and stumps and  sawn logs from which the dry sapwood had been hacked and chopped away. Round  the house, to protect it from bush fires, was a ploughed circle; four years had  passed since it was ploughed, and grass and weeds grew luxuriantly out of it.  At the rear was a pigsty built of heavy logs; and looming behind the sty was a  steep, stony mountain that periodically, when the family were dining, let slip  some granite, which bounded over the pigs and bumped the corner of the house  and knocked slabs out, and shook cobwebs and spiders and shingles and things on  to the dinner, and let daylight into the building. Creeping slowly down the  mountain side, threatening to submerge the sty and the house and the cleared  ground, came a thick, massive scrub from which at night howls and weird noises  arose; also droves of wallabies and things to encourage the Taltys and keep  them employed. In front stretched a paddock of five acres fenced with fallen  timber and sticks and piles of bushes. Talty called it &ldquo;the cultivation,&rdquo;  sometimes the &ldquo;apiary.&rdquo; It contained a patch of wheat embroidered with &ldquo;stinking  Roger&rdquo; and grass higher than any horse, and some bee-hives in white boxes  cocked up on forked sticks. The Taltys went in for honey-raising as well as  agriculture; they didn&rsquo;t believe in placing all their eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>No live stock, excepting a pair of  grey horses, were ever on Talty&rsquo;s selection; and whenever Sandy went to draw  water from the creek he always had to pull the grey horses out of the mud.</p>
<p>The Taltys owned some cattle, but  they only came round the place when the wheat was coming on. They possessed  fowls, too, and a pet kangaroo and an emu and a magpie. These were always at  home. The kangaroo and emu used to forage near the road and race drovers&rsquo; and  shepherds&rsquo; dogs from the fence to the house, where the magpie would lend a hand  and slang the retreating canines.</p>
<p>Talty was a methodical man, and  farmed on a system: a good system, he reckoned, was everything on a farm. He  cooked, for shearers half the year, and grew wheat and pumpkins and strained  honey the other half. He pottered about till all hours of night, and his work  was never done; and he slept every morning till the flies and the heat of the  sun hunted him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the hoe, lads!&rdquo; he would say  to the boys in an eager kind of way just about dinner-time. The boys would rush  round and search the paddock and the long grass about the pig-sty and the heads  of trees, where some of them had &ldquo;seen it one day.&rdquo; When they had found it,  Talty would spend an hour wedging the handle, then he would amble off with it  on his shoulder, the boys following at his heels, and scratch holes in the  grass and plant pumpkin seed, and write down the date of the sowing in a book.  Talty mostly found something to do at the fence, where anyone going by might  see him and ask the way and talk all day if they were not in a hurry.</p>
<p>Talty said he owned altogether  twenty-five head of cattle, mostly cows&mdash;the makers of good milkers, too; and it  was the time when no dairies were about, when no one else had cows, and butter  was four shillings a pound at the store.</p>
<p>And whenever those cows did come  round in the daytime, Talty and the boys, in the interests of the rusty wheat,  would dog and stone them across fences and over ridges, and do their utmost to &ldquo;wander&rdquo;  them. They wouldn&rsquo;t get home till all hours of night; and no sooner would they  be under the blankets when they would hear the cows again. Then Talty and the  boys would bound from bed and run out in their shirts and shout and call the  dog and grope in the dark for stones, and chase the cattle back over more  mountains. The Taltys were always kept going in the wheat season.</p>
<p>Often Talty would come over and  lean on the fence, and discuss things with Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; in wheat,&rdquo; he  used to say, despondingly; nothin&rsquo;! . . . Cows seems to be the on&rsquo;y thing, now  . . . an&rsquo; they ain&rsquo;t to be got . . . But I dunno&rdquo; (and he&rsquo;d look round at the  country and sigh), &ldquo;the wife has a idea of a boardin&rsquo; house in town . . . but I  dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet good, kind-hearted people the  Taltys were; and when in adversity they at last abandoned their homestead and went  away, memories of their careless unselfishness lingered long in the hearts of  Sandy and Kate, who would often sit and speak of them, and wonder if they were  doing well.</p>
<p>The McCabes were different from  the Taltys. There were nine of them. They came to Sleepy Creek before Sandy.</p>
<p>Came one September, when the  country looked well, and the quondong trees hung heavy with crimson fruit.  Their house stood on a clearing in the middle of a pine scrub, and was  surrounded with a new two-wire fence. The fence was a valuable improvement&mdash;so  old McCabe said.</p>
<p>At the back were miles and miles  of prickly pear; in front a cultivation paddock enclosed with a dog-leg fence;  on one side a killing-yard with a gallows fixed in a dead pine-tree. When there  was no beast hanging on the gallows a family of jackasses roosted on it. They  roosted on it, too, when a beast was hanging there. A large quondong tree, with  a sapling ladder leaning against it and reaching up among the branches, shaded  the house. The fowls used the ladder to mount the tree at night.</p>
<p>On the other side was a cowyard  and a log pig-sty, with three piebald pigs in it. McCabe caught the pigs one  day among the prickly-pear while they had their heads down, feeding on a  wallaby.</p>
<p>And there was a garden staked all  round with pine saplings. The bark was leaving the saplings and some of them  were longer than others. In the moonlight they looked like the pipes of a  church organ. The garden was full of sunflowers and pumpkins and young  pine-trees.</p>
<p>McCabe never liked the house; always  said it was too small, after the day he tripped going in the back door and fell  against the front step and cut his head. He used to say he would enlarge it &ldquo;next  year.&rdquo; McCabe was always going to do things &ldquo;next year.&rdquo; But he painted the  house, inside and out, one year; painted it pink. He manufactured the paint  from prickly-pear, and it made a wonderful difference to the place.</p>
<p>Three miles from McCabe&rsquo;s lived  the Dooleys. There were more Dooleys by one than McCabes, a circumstance to  which Dooley attributed the ill-feeling displayed towards him by McCabe. But  McCabe always denied it. He said it was nothing more than a bit of friendly  rivalry on his part, and he reckoned he could take a beating as well as anyone.</p>
<p>One day McCabe and Dooley argued  at Anderson&rsquo;s pub. about horses. McCabe offered to race his piebald against  Dooley&rsquo;s chestnut mare for a bag of pumpkins, and Dooley took him up. Dooley  used to drive a Cup-winner in a dray, and reckoned he knew a lot about racing.</p>
<p>The match took place one Sunday  evening, and everyone gathered in Anderson&rsquo;s paddock to see it. Riley was  proposed as starter and judge, and McCabe objected; objected because it was  Riley who had judged at the grass-fed meeting, when Roberts&rsquo; black mare and  Talty&rsquo;s grey colt ran a dead-heat. Riley said &ldquo;the piebald won.&rdquo; McCabe also  remembered that Riley one summer, when his sight failed, swapped his shot gun  to an Indian hawker for a pair of spectacles which used to bring objects right  up against him, and caused him to give his hand to people to shake when they  weren&rsquo;t near. McCabe made capital out of this. But the publican stuck up for  Riley; said he was a decent, honest man, and McCabe had to give way.</p>
<p>It was hard to tell which horse  was in the better condition. They were a sorry pair! Dooley&rsquo;s chestnut was fed  on pear, while McCabe&rsquo;s looked as though it had been fed on the prickles.</p>
<p>Dooley, his coat off and a white  handkerchief tied round his head, rode out first, and carried a heavy slogger.  After a while McCabe came along; he was bare-backed and bare-footed. Two jam  tins with the ends knocked out were tied over the piebald&rsquo;s eyes to protect  them from the flies; and when Dooley&rsquo;s chestnut saw the tins it sidled off and  wouldn&rsquo;t draw into line. Jack Peck took the brute by the head and pulled him  alongside. While Peck was pulling, McCabe&rsquo;s horse went to sleep. He seemed to  think his rider wanted to &ldquo;pitch.&rdquo; But McCabe jerked his mouth and kicked him  with his heels and woke him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are y&rsquo; riddy?&rdquo; Riley said, and  Dooley and McCabe gathered up their reins, leaned forward, lifted their feet,  and eyed the starter. Riley pointed a heavy muzzle-loader at the clouds and  pulled the trigger. The gun refused to go off. Riley took it down, poked at it  and placed the head of a match in the nipple. Then she exploded before he could  get her to his shoulder again, and blew a hole in the leg of Dooley&rsquo;s pants. .</p>
<p>Both horses jumped away. Everyone  shouted. Two kangaroo dogs ran and got in McCabe&rsquo;s way, and kept the piebald  back. Dooley worked hard on the chestnut. His arms and legs moved like large  eyelids. We could see it was going to be a good race, and ran to the  winning-post to enjoy the finish. They came round &ldquo;the turn&rdquo; neck and neck. A  hundred yards from home Dooley drew into the lead and everyone was shouting &ldquo;The  chestnut &rsquo;ll win!&rdquo; And Mrs. McCabe seemed very down-hearted</p>
<p>But McCabe was a resourceful man.  When he found the piebald was done he slipped off, and putting his head back,  took advantage of his bare feet and came after Dooley. There was excitement,  then! It was too much for the chestnut. She fell down, and Dooley pulled  himself together and chased McCabe, who was out of wind. He couldn&rsquo;t pass him,  though, and Riley gave the race to McCabe. But Dooley never gave him the  pumpkins.</p>

  Two Girls from Town</b></h2>
<p>The sun had gone down. Wallabies  came from the scrub and undergrowth, and hovered about the grasslands; the  birds flew silently to rest; Sandy dropped the plough-handles and unyoked the  horses for the day.</p>
<p>A dray creaked along and stopped  at the door of the house. Kate left the baking and ran out with flour on her  apron and dough on her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness me!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;Liza  and Bella!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the two girls jumped from  the dray she threw her arms about them and hugged them hard in turn, and left  tears on their cheeks and dough-marks on their shoulders. The girls kissed Kate  too, and were pleased they had surprised her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t expecting you till  Thursday,&rdquo; Kate explained, &ldquo;and both of us meant to meet you at the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls shrieked at Kate. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  this Thursday?&rdquo; they squealed.</p>
<p>Kate seemed puzzled. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it  Wednesday?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The girls shrieked more. And Patsy  Riley, whose dray it was, looked out shyly from under his drooping hat, and  drawled &ldquo;Yairs it&rsquo;s Thursday, Mrs. Taylor; I thought it wer&rsquo; Wednesday, too,  till I got to th&rsquo; station this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Kate&rsquo;s turn to shriek now,  and the other two joined in and hung on to their band-boxes and the tail of the  dray, and shed tears and yelled &ldquo;Oh! Mrs. Taylor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patsy smiled, said &ldquo;&rsquo;Night,&rdquo; and  drove on.</p>
<p>Kate led the way inside; and the  visitors removed their hats, put away their luggage, and proceeded to make  themselves at home. Fine jolly girls were Liza Parker and Bella McBean. Plump,  fresh-looking young women, neatly dressed and full of &ldquo;life.&rdquo; They were from  Town, too, and on their first visit to Sleepy Creek&mdash;on their first visit to the  Bush, in fact. They sat down and remained quiet while Kate enquired after their  mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, also their relations and everyone  she knew in town or had heard mention of. Then they pounced on little Jim and  hunted him through the house, and hugged him, and placed him across their knees  and tickled him till he yelled and fought for freedom like a bull calf.</p>
<p>Sandy strolled in with a pumpkin  on his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blowed,&rdquo; he said, and dropped the vegetable heavily on  the floor. It rolled on the dog&rsquo;s paw and made the brute howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Taylor!&rdquo; the girls said, and  rushed round Sandy. Sandy was a favourite with women. Kate looked on and  smiled, and when the reception was over she asked Sandy what day it was.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page073.jpg" alt="girls" width="493" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Wednesday,&rdquo; Sandy said, and the  others shrieked again.</p>
<p>Uncle hobbled in and began a  conversation with the dog. &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; Kate said, &ldquo;this is Liza Parker and Bella  McBean from Ipswich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle gave them his hand, and wasn&rsquo;t  sure if he had ever seen them before, but he knew their fathers well. That was  an old lie of Uncle&rsquo;s. The girls looked hard at Uncle, and Bella McBean  explained the cause of their merriment to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noo,&rdquo; Uncle said, chuckling at  Sandy. &ldquo;I noo it weren&rsquo;t; I tol&rsquo; him yes&rsquo;d&rsquo;y it wer&rsquo; Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think the house was coming  down then! Even the dog rushed about and whined. And when Uncle frowned and  said he was &ldquo;d&mdash;d if he could see ennerthin&rsquo; ter laugh et,&rdquo; Sandy threw up his  big feet and fell backwards off a case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hidjets!&quot; Uncle said, and went outside.</p>
<p>After supper. The girls tied  aprons round themselves, rolled up their sleeves and gave Kate a hand with the  washing-up. Sandy cleaned the old gun and hunted in every hole and corner for  ammunition and the ramrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would y&rsquo; like t&rsquo; see a bit o&rsquo; &rsquo;possum  shootin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he said, flourishing the weapon.</p>
<p>Liza and Bella were delighted.  They had never seen any &rsquo;possum shooting before&mdash;had hardly ever seen a &rsquo;possum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come on, there&rsquo;s plenty  round th&rsquo; corn,&rdquo; and Sandy put the gun on his shoulder. Kate and the visitors  fastened their hat-strings, and Uncle tightened the handkerchief that was  always about his neck, and turned up the collar of his coat, and went too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed  after mooning and blundering about beneath a tree. &ldquo;See him,&rdquo; and the girls  stared into the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite different to bears,&rdquo; one of  them said, and Uncle dropped on his haunches and chuckled. &ldquo;Different to bears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy brushed everyone aside and  levelled the gun; and Liza and Bella tittered and crept behind Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s poked himself behind a limb,&rdquo;  Sandy said, and stepped back a pace or two to get better aim, and fell over  Uncle and lost the gun. Uncle rose and danced about and called Sandy &ldquo;a awkward  galoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was I t&rsquo; see y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sandy  snapped, &ldquo;when y&rsquo; go an&rsquo; sit down behind a fellow in th&rsquo; dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might &rsquo;a&rsquo; shot someone!&rdquo; Uncle  growled, retiring out of range, while Sandy took aim again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Click! Click! Click!&rdquo; was all  Sandy could get out of the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me another cap!&rdquo; he called  to Uncle, who was in charge of the ammunition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way have y&rsquo; got &rsquo;er pointin&rsquo;,  fust?&rdquo; Uncle answered. Sandy assured him she was &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; and Uncle came  from behind a stump and felt himself all over for caps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s th&rsquo; powder an&rsquo; shot an&rsquo;  the paper,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;y&rsquo; must have th&rsquo; caps y&rsquo;self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy said he hadn&rsquo;t, and  remembered giving them to Uncle after taking one from the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they must be where y&rsquo; fell  over me,&rdquo; Uncle answered, and an hour was spent striking matches and searching  amongst the grass and brambles for the caps.</p>
<p>Kate grew restless. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t  matter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you can shoot plenty another night.&rdquo; Then she and the girls  retired empty-handed to the house, and talked about the people in town, and  patterns, and puddings, and things.</p>
<p>But Sandy was bent upon securing a  &rsquo;possum for Liza and Bella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See can I knock him,&rdquo; he said to  Uncle, and opened fire on the pest with stones and waddies. Uncle crouched in  the grass and watched the effect of every missile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just grazed &rsquo;is  &rsquo;ead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waddies rattled among the  limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shiftin&rsquo; &rsquo;im!&rdquo;&mdash;from Uncle.</p>
<p>Sandy let fly some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; down; look out for  him.&rdquo; And Uncle danced about the foot of the tree. Sandy ran in armed with a  long stick with a prong projecting from it which he was not aware of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit &rsquo;im! hit &rsquo;im!&rdquo; Uncle yelled.  (Uncle could see the vermin, but Sandy couldn&rsquo;t locate it at all.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There in the low fork&mdash;d&mdash;n it,  look! he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;ere, &rsquo;ere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &rsquo;possum came down the trunk of  the tree, and Sandy swung the stick and hit Uncle on the neck with the prong,  and Uncle sank softly in the grass. Sandy continued to deal blows all round the  tree in quick succession. But the &rsquo;possum reached the ground and escaped to a  towering gum, where he was soon swaying calmly about in the boughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy th&rsquo; little devil gettin&rsquo;  away!&rdquo; Sandy said. Not a sound came from Uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how th&rsquo; little wretch jumped?&rdquo;  Uncle was still silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s th&rsquo; matter?&rdquo; Sandy asked,  a feeling of suspicion creeping over him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; and he felt for Uncle,  then struck a match and saw blood on him. Sandy rushed away to the house and  called for water and alarmed Kate and the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear me!&rdquo; Kate said, &ldquo;Uncle&rsquo;s <i>shot!</i>&rdquo; Then there was commotion.</p>
<p>While Sandy was procuring water,  Uncle, half-dazed, struggled to his feet and staggered off in the wrong  direction.</p>
<p>Sandy, followed by Kate and the  girls, rushed to the scene of the accident with water and a supply of rag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here somewhere,&rdquo; Sandy  said; &ldquo;this is the tree.&rdquo; And he stared perplexedly into the branches of the  dead box. One of the girls tripped against the gun and took fright. Sandy was  convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be over here,&rdquo; he said,  advancing to the right. He struck a match. &ldquo;Where are y&rsquo;?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where th&rsquo;  deuce &rsquo;a&rsquo; y&rsquo; got t&rsquo;? <i>Uncle!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was <i>here</i>,&rdquo; Sandy said, and knelt down to examine the place with the aid  of a lighted match. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s blood, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate and the girls shuddered. &ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t <i>killed</i> him?&rdquo; Kate said in  tones of apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Killed </i>&rsquo;im! oh, my God! That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll be saying,&rdquo; and Sandy  started running round in the dark calling at the top of his voice for Uncle.</p>
<p>Uncle had staggered on till he  fouled the wire fence. Then he followed it along till it spanned a dirty little  water-hole into which he blundered. When he pulled himself out all his senses  had returned, and he made for the house. He heard Sandy cooeeing and feebly  responded. A heavy load was lifted from Sandy&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did y&rsquo; get to,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo; I thought you was <i>hurt?</i>&rdquo; Uncle  groaned, and Sandy dragged him inside to the light.</p>
<p>A sorry sight Uncle was&mdash;mud from  head to heels. He couldn&rsquo;t see for mud! Kate and the girls looked him up and  down just for a second, then they broke out and screamed. Sandy turned away and  tried to keep calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If y&rsquo; got hit on th&rsquo; back o&rsquo; th&rsquo;  neck with a stick,&rdquo; Uncle growled, &ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t know where you was till y&rsquo; fell  in a d&mdash;d hole, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to laugh!&rdquo; And he fixed his eyes on Bella. She  jumped off her seat and screamed more. But Sandy secured a light and took Uncle  out to the shed, where he scraped him down, then put him to bed.</p>
<p>When Liza and Bella said &ldquo;Good  night&rdquo; to Kate and Sandy, they closed the door of their room, put things against  it, then talked about Uncle and tittered till all hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  Cows and Horses</b></h2>
<p>Liza and Bella were up next  morning before the sun, and went out to watch Sandy milking. They ventured into  the yard, and rushed out in disorder when Riley&rsquo;s red bull came and bellowed  into the calf-pen. Sandy stood up and grinned, and they returned to try their  hands at milking. They tugged at the teats, and pinched them with their finger  nails, and let the bucket fall in the mud when the cow kicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Sandy said, brushing  them away and seating himself under the cow. They stood admiring Sandy&rsquo;s skill  for awhile, then Bella McBean leaned against the door of the calf-pen, which  suddenly fell in, and a big bull calf rushed out, scraping tufts of hair off  himself against the edges of the doorway, and plunged for possession of the cow&rsquo;s  udder, and knocked Sandy off the milking block and emptied the milk over him.  Talk of hilarity! You could hear those girls a mile away! Sandy pulled himself  out of the dirt, and lifted his foot to kick the bull calf on the jaw; but,  remembering there were ladies present, restrained himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer brute!&rdquo; he hissed, and seized  the calf by the ears to tear him from the cow. But Bully stuck to his hold like  a leech, and bunted and slobbered and sucked hard to make hay while the sun  shone. The girls enjoyed Bully more and more; and Liza was shrieking at the top  of her voice, her back turned to the pen, when Silky&rsquo;s calf, a nervous rat of a  heifer, bounded out, and swerving to avoid Bella, mixed itself up in Liza&rsquo;s  skirts and carried her off her feet. Then Sandy yelled, &ldquo;Hoh! hoh! hoh! Ha! ha!  ha!&rdquo; and leaned against the cow and let the bull calf get all the milk.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page082.jpg" alt="calf" width="650" height="477"></p>
<p>Bella and Liza left the yard,  tittering, to return to the house. The red bull strolled leisurely towards them  and shook his head. They screamed and raced for the back door, which was  closed. The dogs barked. Uncle opened the back door and ran out in his shirt to  see what the matter was. Bella and Liza squealed more when they saw Uncle, and  stopped and looked in different directions. Uncle wheeled round and rushed  inside.</p>
<p>Liza and Bella had been over a  week with Sandy and Kate, and their time was nearly up. Kate wished they could  remain another month or two months; Sandy said he wouldn&rsquo;t mind if they stayed  for ever. &ldquo;Makes th&rsquo; place lively,&rdquo; he added. Uncle, though, wished they would &ldquo;clear  out and never come back again.&rdquo; &ldquo;All this giggling at everythink gets sickenin&rsquo;,&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>Every afternoon Kate drove the  girls out in the cart to see some of her friends, and Mrs. Riley had yet to be  called on. The day arrived to visit her, and Kate was sorry she couldn&rsquo;t  accompany the girls. Sandy was busy putting in potatoes and required  assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can drive yourselves,&rdquo;  Kate said, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t far&mdash; or Uncle will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said they would drive  themselves. Bella was sure she could pilot the conveyance, and both were  delighted with the prospect of their final outing.</p>
<p>Kate left the house to assist  Sandy, and the girls successfully caught the old mare. Sandy had left the  necessary harness in the cart, and they proceeded to fasten it on Gypsy. After  a lot of discussion and contradiction they agreed as to how the collar should  be adjusted. The saddle and breeching bothered them a good deal. It was a heavy  strain on them; but when it came to putting the crupper on the mare their real  trouble commenced. Bella approached Gypsy&rsquo;s tail with care and caution, while  Liza held the animal firmly by the bit and tittered. Gypsy lifted her hind foot  and stamped it heavily on the ground, because of flies, just at the  psychological moment. Bella gave a short squeal and jumped back, and, treading  on a pumpkin, which rolled from under her, fell down. Liza let go the mare&rsquo;s  head and fled. Then they laughed at each other and said they were glad no one  was about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See can <i>you</i> fix it,&rdquo; Bella said. But Liza wouldn&rsquo;t take any risks. She was  not a horsebreaker. She had a head full of good ideas, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her round to the verandah,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;and put it on through the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They led Gypsy round to the  verandah, backed her in beneath the window (there were no floor boards), and  while Liza stuck to her head again, Bella slipped inside, mounted the sofa and  leaned out to reach for the crupper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push her back a little, Liza,&rdquo;  she chuckled.</p>
<p>Liza giggled, and put some weight  into her work. Bella, with an effort, managed to grip the leather.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page085.jpg" alt="gypsy" width="650" height="490"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Little further!&rdquo; she said  encouragingly, at the same time pulling with all her strength. But instead of  backing, the old brute stubbornly slewed her hindquarters round and dragged  Bella through the window. When Liza saw her companion falling she threw up her  hands and squealed into the mare&rsquo;s ears, and the animal took fright, and  trotted gently round the yard. But Bella didn&rsquo;t fall heavily. The  window-shutter, which opened on the inside, closed as she fell, and one of her  feet jammed, and she hung like a flag at half-mast. She giggled while Liza  struggled to rescue her, but when Uncle&rsquo;s voice and footsteps suddenly sounded  near she screamed appallingly. Her screams only made Uncle the more heroic. He  rushed past Liza, entered the house, pulled the window shutter with one hand,  pushed Bella&rsquo;s foot with the other, and&mdash;dropped her on her head.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t go to Riley&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Liza and Bella often talk about  their trip to Sleepy Greek, and they always say they were never at a place  where they enjoyed themselves so well, and they&rsquo;ve both been to Government  House several times.</p>

  One Corn Season</b></h2>
<p>Sandy was knocking his selection  into shape. Every day it became more and more like a place that was inhabited.  No prickly-pear, no undergrowth, no logs, no brambles, no timber or rubbish of  any kind lay around the house now. Only a few large trees, half naked, stood  near, and they were withering. Sandy stripped them for roofing for the  fowl-house, and the calf-pen, and the new barn he had erected.</p>
<p>Sandy was pushing ahead. He had  four acres planted with lucerne, and eight more under corn&mdash;fine healthy-looking  corn, too! And talk about work! Sandy rarely rested. He would begin hard at  daylight, and bullock till he couldn&rsquo;t see&mdash;bullock till the stars came out and  blinked and blazed&mdash;till Kate exhausted herself cooeeing and calling, and came  and abused him for keeping supper waiting.</p>
<p>While the corn was maturing Sandy  extended operations&mdash; cut more prickly-pear; grubbed more big trees; rolled more  heavy logs together; tramped, trudged, and groped round gathering and raking up  sticks and banking-up fires till another plot of land&mdash;six acres&mdash;was bare of  everything but ashes and grass. Sandy had no respect for timber; didn&rsquo;t  recognise it was a splendid asset for the country, or show any desire to  conserve any of it for those who were to come after him. There was no national  spirit in Sandy that way.</p>
<p>A public holiday. A day of dust,  of thirst and flies and hell&rsquo;s own heat on the selection; a day of glee and  gaiety, pomp and picnics and military display in the city.</p>
<p>The posts were in the ground, and  Sandy was running a couple of wires around the new land&mdash;old, second-hand stuff  it was, too&mdash; wire that had been put up in heaps instead of coils, and was the  devil and all to work. It twisted, knotted, tangled itself up like a  fishing-line, and repeatedly went asunder and raised lumps of profanity on  Sandy.</p>
<p>Kate left the house and went to  assist Sandy; and together they strained and struggled the whole day, dragging  the wire through those posts. Terrible work it was lugging and humouring that  wretched, rusty material! and not a yard of it would run smoothly. Perspiration  flowed from both of them. Now and again Kate would feel as though she must give  in, and Sandy would throw the wire down and advise her to take a &ldquo;spell.&rdquo; Then  they&rsquo;d sit in the shade, somewhere, mopping themselves, brushing the flies  away, and deploring the necessity for fencing at all, and uselessly wishing  they had been born lucky, or rich, or blind, or something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; Sandy would say,  rising wearily to it again; &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t much more of it to be done now.&rdquo; And  Kate would tie the strings of her bonnet together, and slowly struggle to her  feet too.</p>
<p>The eye of a dusty drover, riding  loosely on the wings of a mob of cattle passing down the creek, would rest for  a moment on Sandy and Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s <i>life</i> for y&rsquo;!&rdquo;&mdash;he would say to a companion coming round from the  tail of the mob.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page090.jpg" alt="life" width="650" height="485"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible!&rdquo; the other would  answer, and with a grim, sad sort of chuckle they&rsquo;d turn their heads away.  Drovers never could see any pleasure or poetry in a selection.</p>
<p>And Sandy and Kate would pause to  stare at the cattle, and at the tired, worn-out looking men behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rough time them poor devils must  have,&rdquo; Sandy would murmur sympathisingly; &ldquo;going all day in th&rsquo; heat, an&rsquo;  camping out every night, wet or dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always from home, too,&rdquo; Kate  would add; &ldquo;an&rsquo; some o&rsquo; them, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps, have no home to go to! Thank goodness we&rsquo;re  not so bad off as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Kate had a warm place in  their hearts for the drovers.</p>
<p>Occasionally little Jim, who had  to put in a long, lonely day under the trees near by, diverted their attention  and provided some relaxation. At intervals he would poke about the slack wire,  and when Sandy pulled and lurched viciously to tighten it, Jim would be found  hanging in it by the legs. To console him took more time and rubbing than it  would to restore the apparently drowned. More often though, green-heads or  hornets were the cause of his distress; and once, when playing about the head  of a fallen tree, he yelled and held up his hands and jumped backwards in such  a way that Sandy thought there must be a snake, and made a blind rush to rescue  his offspring, and fell over a stump hidden in the grass, and skinned his knee  and his elbow, and tore a piece out of a new flannel shirt he had on. But it  was only a jew-lizard waddling casually after Jim with its mouth open.</p>
<p>When the last panel was wired,  Kate sat heavily down and sighed, and fervently thanked God it was finished.</p>
<p>On the way to the house Sandy  brightened up, and talked cheerfully of their prospects, and invited Kate to  view the corn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s grown a foot since yesterday,&rdquo; he said. But Kate couldn&rsquo;t;  she was not in a mood to admire maize or anything else just then. She would  have passed a mirror without looking into it, or one of her own sex without  turning to see &ldquo;what she had on.&rdquo; Sandy stalked through the crop, though. He  flew round and got supper ready, too, when he reached the house that night.</p>
<p>Sandy ploughing; breaking up the  new land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stan&rsquo; up! . . . Gypsy! . . . Vi&rsquo;let!  . . . now then&mdash;<i>come on!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perspiring and agitated, he stood  and jumped the plough about to loosen the soil at its nose and give the brutes  a chance. The jaded old mares, poor, weak, worn-out and covered with sweat,  stood too. Kate, anxious-looking, and holding the reins and a whip in her  hands, stood also. &rsquo;Twas a fine picture; it would have looked well done in  oils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; Sandy began again; &ldquo;<i>Gypsy!</i> . . . come on, <i>Vi&rsquo;let!</i> . . . <i>Gyp&rsquo;!</i> . . .&rdquo; They strained and rocked and rolled against each  other; then slackened off and backed, and sat down in a heap on the plough, and  groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Blarst</i> them!&rdquo; and Sandy took the reins and whip from Kate. &ldquo;See can  y&rsquo; hold th&rsquo; plough, awhile,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Kate stood near the handles, and  begged Sandy not to be &ldquo;hard on the poor old things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sandy&rsquo;s blood was up. He  shortened the reins and shouted &ldquo;<i>Vil&rsquo;t!</i> . . . <i>Gypsy!</i>&rdquo; and dropped the whip  heavily on their hides, and knocked dust out of them.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page093.jpg" alt="gypsy" width="650" height="486"></p>
<p>Kate turned her head and looked  away. The old mares swayed and tumbled about; then took to the collars and  moved off as if breaking up was easy. The plough glided smoothly after them on  its side. Sandy hurried along and roared and applied more whip to them. Sandy  knew when he had an advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You old devils!&rdquo; he shouted  triumphantly; &ldquo;you can do it well enough when you like.&rdquo; They kept going for  about thirty yards, when Sandy glanced over his shoulder to see how Kate was  manipulating the implement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Weh-h!</i>&rdquo; he yelled, when he saw she was not between the handles, and  pulled the brutes up suddenly with an angry jerk. Then he threw the reins down  in disgust, glanced back at Kate, standing motionless, and growled &ldquo;What th&rsquo;  devil&rsquo;s th&rsquo; good o&rsquo; that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate started to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;d if I can see any joke in it!&rdquo;  Sandy said, and commenced throwing the plough about, and was looking ugly, when  the new slip-rails near by&mdash;a barricade of bark and green saplings &mdash;fell with a  crash. Sandy looked up and saw a man leading a horse over the ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dad!</i> it&rsquo;s <i>Dad!</i>&rdquo; Kate  exclaimed, and ran to meet her parent.</p>
<p>Sandy brightened up all at once.  He grinned and strode forward, too; for Dad it was&mdash;Dad on his old black horse,  and on his first visit to Sleepy Creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is where y&rsquo; are?&rdquo; Dad  began, staring about. He shook hands with them, then proceeded to indict Dave  and Joe for misleading him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would neverer got here,&rdquo; he went  on, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d a&rsquo; come th&rsquo; way <i>they</i> said! They tol&rsquo; me y&rsquo; wuz away back here!&rdquo; And Dad waved his hand all round the  compass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave been &rsquo;ere three hours ago if it weren&rsquo;t for <i>thet</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate and Sandy smiled. They knew  Dad had been bushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know th&rsquo; place well enough,  now,&rdquo; Dad added, looking round as though he had once been familiar with the  locality. In dissimulation Dad hadn&rsquo;t many equals.</p>
<p>Sandy took Dad&rsquo;s horse and put it  in the grass-paddock; and Kate, having inquired after Mother and Sarah and the  rest, hurried to the house to put the meat on for supper. Had it been the King  or a circus that had arrived Sandy and Kate couldn&rsquo;t have been more pleased.</p>
<p>Dad ran his eye over Sandy&rsquo;s  plough-horses. Dad always admired that class of animal. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s th&rsquo; good o&rsquo; <i>them?</i>&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;y&rsquo;ll never break this  up wi&rsquo; them; they&rsquo;re too weak, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after walking round and  examining them closely: &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t y&rsquo; any better than <i>them?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will have, next year,&rdquo; Sandy  drawled; &ldquo;when we break in th&rsquo; two foals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s <i>plenty</i> o&rsquo; them at my place,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; (Dad was  prospering now); &ldquo;an&rsquo; if y&rsquo; like t&rsquo; come over y&rsquo; can have y&rsquo;r pick of a couple  t&rsquo; work an&rsquo; keep as long as y&rsquo; like. . . . Them ol&rsquo; mares ain&rsquo;t fit fer ploughin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy showed his delight, and said  it was &ldquo;just what he wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; Dad said;  and Sandy thanked him again.</p>
<p>After talking about rain and  things, Sandy threw the harness off the old mares and escorted Dad over the &ldquo;farm.&rdquo;  Sandy was proud of the progress he was making, and pointed out the potatoes and  the lucerne to Dad, and showed him the corn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;very good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy told Dad how long the corn  had taken to grow, and figured out the number of bushels he expected to get of  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; Dad said; &ldquo;jusso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great soil, y&rsquo; know,&rdquo; Sandy  remarked with enthusiasm, rooting up some with his boot for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; Dad answered, &ldquo;no  doubt.&rdquo; Then, after casting his eyes over the selection and reflecting: &ldquo;Yairs,  you ought t&rsquo; do pretty well here, between y&rsquo;, after a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy said he expected to do &ldquo;real  well,&rdquo; as soon as the new ground was ready and everything straight. Then Dad  gave him a lot of advice; told him several times to &ldquo;keep at it,&rdquo; to &ldquo;stick to it,&rdquo;  and to &ldquo;use his head,&rdquo; and they adjourned to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been tellin&rsquo; him,&rdquo; Dad said  to Kate, &ldquo;t&rsquo; come over and get a couple o&rsquo; good horses&mdash;them old mares is  useless to him; no one could plough new ground w&rsquo; <i>them!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears came into Kate&rsquo;s eyes, and  she said it was real good of Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s <i>plenty</i> of &rsquo;em there,&rdquo; Dad said lightly; &ldquo;plenty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad stayed all night with Sandy  and Kate. He camped on the floor, and didn&rsquo;t get any sleep. &ldquo;Th&rsquo; damn &rsquo;possums,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;was runnin&rsquo; over me all night.&rdquo; And after looking round the place  again and giving Sandy more advice, he went home next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t f&rsquo;get t&rsquo; come for th&rsquo;  horses,&rdquo; he said when parting with Sandy.</p>
<p>Sandy didn&rsquo;t forget. He started  for them at dawn the following day. He reached Saddletop before dinner, and  found Dad at the yard. Dad was walking round roaring and railing about a heifer  that had burst on the lucerne, and vigorously reviling Bill and Tom for  negligence, and threatening them with violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what there is d&rsquo;rec&rsquo;ly,&rdquo;  Dad snapped when Sandy reminded him of his promise. Then he hobbled off, and  left Sandy hanging round the cow-yard for an hour while he went and swore at  Dave.</p>
<p>After a lot of hesitation Sandy  approached Dad again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; last time I lent a horse,&rdquo;  Dad snorted, &ldquo;it wer&rsquo; sent back w&rsquo; sore shoulders and <i>lame</i> . . . <i>Lending!</i>&rdquo; he  mumbled, walking away, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but <i>lend!  lend! lend!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while he called to Joe to  know if there was &ldquo;a draught horse that could be done without for a week or so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe said there was; and named  four, all staunch, useful plough-horses.</p>
<p>Dad ignored them all. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Molly  there?&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs, she&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; Joe said,  grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bring her in.&rdquo; (Turning to  Sandy): &ldquo;Y&rsquo; can take <i>Molly</i>; but mind  an&rsquo; give&rsquo;er a bit o&rsquo; feed, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t knock her about, an&rsquo; see &rsquo;er shoulders don&rsquo;t  get bad, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t keep her over there after y&rsquo;ve done w&rsquo; &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly was about the ugliest,  oldest, poorest and meanest animal Dad had ever owned, and ten times more  worthless and unreliable than Sandy&rsquo;s own old stagers.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page099.jpg" alt="molly" width="650" height="483"></p>
<p>Sandy stood when Joe yarded Molly,  and stared as though he doubted her species. Then, without any display of  gratitude or enthusiasm, he mooched up and put a halter on her, and pulled her  out the gate. Sandy looked sulky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not got much condition,&rdquo; he  mumbled as he passed Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t like &rsquo;er,&rdquo; Dad  yelled, &ldquo;<i>leave</i> &rsquo;er!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>D&mdash;n</i> y&rsquo;! I <i>will</i> leave &rsquo;er,  then,&rdquo; Sandy squealed, and pulling the halter off, he let the brute go. &ldquo;Keep y&rsquo;r  rubbish! he hissed to Dad; and jumped on his own horse and rode hard away.</p>
<p>Sandy tried to explain to Kate why  he had returned without the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t a&rsquo; minded,&rdquo; Kate said  kindly; &ldquo;I would &rsquo;a&rsquo; brought Molly.&rdquo; But a woman doesn&rsquo;t know how humiliation  hits at the heart of a man.</p>
<p>Sandy didn&rsquo;t lose heart. He  accepted a pair of colts from Daley to break in, and with their aid scratched  up the new ground.</p>
<p>The corn matured. But Sandy didn&rsquo;t  get anything out of it, except a lot of running about. The cockatoos got most;  they swarmed round and ravaged it every day, and what they overlooked the &rsquo;possums  took away at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sickenin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sandy said, &ldquo;sickenin&rsquo;!&rdquo;  And for days he sat about the house brooding and reflecting.</p>
<p>Kate talked to him sympathisingly.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else to turn t&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;an&rsquo; perhaps we might do better if  we tried again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Sandy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try and he took up the axe and went and cut down more trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  In the Drought Time</b></h2>
<p>Sandy looked at the sky, then sat  balanced on the middle wires of the fence surrounding the humpy. His large  brown elbows rested on his knees, his eyes were riveted on the ground.</p>
<p>Opposite him stood Kate. She cast  a languid look over the drought-stricken land, then rested her eyes on the form  of her dispirited, disheartened husband.</p>
<p>An irreverent dog leaned against a  tree near by and barked feebly at a harmless small lizard. The brute always  leaned against something when it barked&mdash;it was too thin to exert itself  standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another one dead,&rdquo; Sandy  murmured sorrowfully, referring to the cows. &ldquo;One more, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; th&rsquo; lot&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate stared pensively towards a  spot in the gully strewn with boughs and bags where a beast lay&mdash;where it had  lain a fortnight&mdash;and large tears came into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it would ra&mdash;rain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain!&rdquo; (A pause). &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll never  rain in this blasted place.&rdquo; And Sandy left the wires and again surveyed the  hopeless, heartless heavens. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas never like this,&rdquo; he said wearily, scanning  the scorched surroundings.</p>
<p>And never was it&mdash;never within the  memory of man. There was no water, no grass&mdash;no roots even; the whole country  was bare, burnt, blackened. Most of the wretched stock had died, those that had  not were just lingering on apple-tree. Day after day the sun struck fiercely,  mercilessly down; the earth yielded nothing but dust; mile upon mile of large  forest trees were dead, and bush fires raged all round, at night lighting the  gloomy range till it looked like a great city&mdash;or a great hell.</p>
<p>Uncle Peter limped out of the  house and yawned, and called attention to Mrs. Grogan felling trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An awful woman ter work,&rdquo; Uncle  said in tired tones.</p>
<p>Uncle admired people who worked.  To be able to work well, he said, one must begin early in life. Uncle must have  commenced pretty late himself.</p>
<p>A water reserve, consisting of  stones, bleached bones, grass-trees, and a mud hole where cattle and kangaroos  got bogged together, divided Sandy&rsquo;s selection from Mrs. Grogan&rsquo;s homestead.</p>
<p>From his yard Sandy could see the  widow&rsquo;s house showing through the trees&mdash;a large slab humpy roofed with bark,  heavy saplings and boulders holding the roof down; ten acres of cultivation  with stumps in it as numerous as the stars; some irregular palings leaning all  directions, and a dog-leg fence around the lot.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grogan was a widow, a frail,  jaded widow with bent back and sunken cheeks&mdash;the only female on Sleepy Greek  who owned a selection. Grogan left it to her.</p>
<p>Multitudes of husbands die every  year without bequeathing their wives so much as a stick. Grogan was not one of  these. He was energetic, a man who made provision for the future. Besides the  selection he left his widow ten children, and a mortgage, and a heavy bill to  pay, and the fence to mend, and the ploughing to do. And the widow inherited  the lot cheerfully, faced it all, beginning where Grogan had left off. How she  hoped to succeed the Lord only could tell!</p>
<p>For a year she strained and  struggled&mdash;put on a man&rsquo;s hat and shirt, cleared land, humped water, ploughed  through the hottest day, or tramped beside the harrow; a train of ragged,  helpless offspring at her heels, crying and complaining of hunger, and of burr  and bindai in their shoeless feet. Often, like motherless little lambs, they  nestled together in the shade of the bushes and whined till they fell asleep.</p>
<p>To people who passed they were  objects of pity: it was seldom people passed that way, though, unless they were  lost.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grogan harvested several bags  of wheat, and great was the rejoicing in the humble home. Johnny and Mary&mdash;the  eldest boy and girl&mdash;took it to the railway station, three sacks at a time, in  an old spring cart held together with wire rope and wooden wedges.</p>
<p>Obedient to orders, they never  hurried or harassed Stumpy, the family cart-horse. They allowed him his own  time, and Stumpy enjoyed it. A careful servant was Stumpy. Had he belonged to  an ambulance brigade he couldn&rsquo;t have moved with more precaution. If the wheels  touched a stone, or an obstacle however small, he would stand instantly and  wait till it was removed. He would wait all night if it were necessary.  Sometimes he deceived himself, and stopped where there was no obstacle, and  unless someone dismounted and pretended to remove the obstruction he would  refuse to budge any more. A horse you could trust&mdash;anyone could drive Stumpy.  Whenever his winkers dropped off and got round his legs he never took fright,  he always kept going till he saw a shade to put his head in; then he would wait  patiently till Johnny jumped down and tied them on again. Johnny generally took  an hour to tie the winkers on. Stumpy didn&rsquo;t mind if he took a week.</p>
<p>From the railway station you could  see the cart coming an hour before it arrived, and one couldn&rsquo;t see more than  half a mile at a time in the country round Sleepy Creek. And when they kept  others waiting while they wasted the daylight struggling to back Stumpy up to  the goods-shed&mdash;Johnny at his head and Mary at the wheel&mdash;no one ever swore or  demurred. The station-master would go out of his way cheerfully to unload the  grain, and as they drove off again would shake his head in sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor devils!&rdquo; he would mutter  solemnly, following the dejected turn-out, as it wobbled away, with his big  soft eyes. &ldquo;Poor little devils!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow often came to Sandy&rsquo;s  place to see could she borrow one of the old mares to plough with. She never  could, though. Not that Sandy was selfish and unneighbourly, but the old mares  were barely able to carry their hides, to say nothing of dragging a plough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I on&rsquo;y wish they was able t&rsquo;,&rdquo;  Sandy would say, and as a solatium Kate always asked the widow how the children  were getting along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well most of them is,  though Kitty&rsquo;s in bed with th&rsquo; cold ter day; an&rsquo; Willie have a bad foot&mdash;all  festered up roun&rsquo; the heel; an&rsquo; Mitty&rsquo;s complained terrible about &rsquo;er stomach  ever since yes&rsquo;dy, an&rsquo; las&rsquo; night I had t&rsquo; be up four times with her, but this  morning I give &rsquo;er a good dose o&rsquo; oil an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s a little bit better&rdquo; (moving  off a step or two). &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s a worry with so many, so &rsquo;tis, an&rsquo; one can&rsquo;t see  to them all as y&rsquo; would like an&rsquo; be out workin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; paddick. It&rsquo;s too much  for one. But Mary&rsquo;s getting a good help now&mdash;so&rsquo;s Johnny; he&rsquo;s shootin&rsquo; bears  ter-day; he shot seven yes&rsquo;d&rsquo;y and two &rsquo;possums las&rsquo; night thet was always comin&rsquo;  down the chimley after th&rsquo; flour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with a weird smile the widow  would move away again and depart. And Kate staring after her would sigh, and  sighing imagine her own misfortunes a lot lighter; and for one blessing, at  least, she would fervently thank God&mdash;thank Him that she had a husband to toil  for her. &rsquo;Twas one thing Kate never forgot&mdash;neither did Sandy.</p>
<p>One morning Sandy felled a  bottle-tree in the scrub and shouldered portions of it home to try it on  Strawberry. Strawberry was his last surviving cow, and was kept above ground in  a sling. But the bottle-tree didn&rsquo;t tempt her; she stared at it and moaned and  moved her fleshless carcase as though she inwardly rejoiced. Then she took a  fresh turn&mdash;went limp and died. Sandy kicked her, but she didn&rsquo;t respond. So he  turned sadly away to break the news to Kate.</p>
<p>He was walking slowly, his eyes  fixed on the ground, pondering, when suddenly a commotion at the house startled  him. He looked up. Uncle, standing on a stump near the house, was excitedly  ejaculating, while Kate screamed that Grogan&rsquo;s house was on fire. Sandy  hastened, and seeing thick smoke belching from the widow&rsquo;s roof forgot his own  trouble and rushed to the rescue.</p>
<p>Uncle, handicapped with a cough  and varicose veins and sore feet and lack of enthusiasm generally, followed  slowly.</p>
<p>Sandy and young Williams, who had  also arrived on the scene, burst open the door of the house and dragged out  some rough furniture that Grogan in his lifetime had knocked together with the  aid of a tomahawk and a slushlight. But a sudden gust of wind lifted the flames  through the opening, and the dwelling commenced to burn like paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use!&rdquo; Sandy said at last,  turning with a sickly look to the terrified widow clutching her offspring, as  though apprehending they would walk into the fire, &ldquo;y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp it now.&rdquo; And  he stood off, wiping the perspiration from his face, and looked miserable.</p>
<p>Uncle, distressed and breathless,  arrived. He planted himself within a paling enclosure and gasped out useless  injunctions to Sandy, who refused to hear them. But Uncle, too, lost hope, and  in silence viewed the conflagration.</p>
<p>Johnny Grogan, who had been absent  at the store, turned up. He dashed round the burning house and attempted to  enter at the back. The flames repelled him. Tried again; then smashed in a bark  window, and inserting an arm to the shoulder, groped for something. He withdrew  his arm suddenly and nursed it a second, then groped more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; he exclaimed joyously,  and hooked out a rifle, the woodwork all aflame; he heaved it from him and  rubbed his hands.</p>
<p>The rifle, a short-barrelled  magazine, fell at Uncle&rsquo;s feet flaring like a torch. Uncle stared hard at it.  It was a curiosity to him. He lifted his foot to stamp out the blaze, when &ldquo;<i>Bang!</i>&rdquo; went the weapon with a loud report,  and bouncing up at Uncle turned in the air like a live thing. Uncle got the  fright of his life. &ldquo;<i>Hooh!</i>&rdquo; he  exclaimed, and staggered as though he were wounded.</p>
<p>The rifle lay smouldering, the  muzzle pointing at Uncle&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, there&rsquo;s more in it,&rdquo;  Johnny shouted, getting out of reach himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;y&rsquo;!&rdquo; Uncle gasped, backing  away, yet keeping both eyes on the firearm as he would on a snake. But the  palings blocked him. He put his hands behind and felt, and clutching the  obstruction anchored himself. His thoughts travelled fast. Anticipating another  shot, he raised his left foot to bring it out of the line of fire, but  hurriedly put it down and lifted the other. He repeated the motion several  times and looked like a dancing bear. Only for a second, though. &ldquo;<i>Bang! bang! bang!</i>&rdquo; &lsquo;Three shots in quick  succession were aimed at Uncle, then the panel of paling went down with a  crash, and he fell through and escaped. No one laughed.</p>
<p>Sandy turned to the distracted  widow, and a lump that threatened to choke him rose in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t stay here, Mrs. Grogan,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no use cryin&rsquo;&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be helped&rdquo; (he gulped the lump  down).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring th&rsquo; children and come home  with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he raised the smallest  toddler to his broad shoulder, and taking another by the hand led the way  through the rails, into the hollow, and over the ridge. And as the train of  homeless ones tramped in file along the narrow winding track, the moaning oak  trees, the charred ruins of Hodgson&rsquo;s Scrub, the dead, gaunt gums, and the  great desolate Range, all seemed to join in their despair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Sandy&rsquo;s Lucky Shot</b></h2>
<p>Sandy worked harder than ever. The  burning-off continued, and every night the fires blazed in the grass-paddock  again. And while the crop ripened Sandy lost no time; through the long, hot  days he belted away with the maul and knocked up posts enough to go round the  land he was clearing.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Mahon, the only person on Sleepy  who possessed a reaper, was to reap for Sandy; but he couldn&rsquo;t come till he had  knocked Finley&rsquo;s down, and he couldn&rsquo;t begin on Finley&rsquo;s till his own was taken  off.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Mahon had barely commenced his  own&mdash;fifty acres, too&mdash;when something went wrong with the machine. Something was  always going wrong with the machine. Portions of it had to be sent to town for  repairs, and just then Sandy&rsquo;s twelve acres turned dead ripe. It worried Sandy.  He moped about from day to day watching the crop; said he didn&rsquo;t know what &ldquo;th&rsquo;  devil to do,&rdquo; and wished he had known M&rsquo;Mahon was going to humbug him, and he&rsquo;d  have begun with a scythe weeks ago. But Kate was more resourceful than Sandy.  She put on her hat and went down to McMahon and gave him a piece of her mind.  When she returned with the balance she went through the wheat with Sandy,  testing it here and there&mdash;lovely full grain it was, too&mdash;and both agreed it  might stand another fortnight, when M&rsquo;Mahon promised to turn up for certain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Finley, who also had  lost faith in M&rsquo;Mahon, in sheer desperation went to town and ordered a new  harvester of the latest brand, on time payment. At the end of a week people  from the township, and for miles around, assembled on Finley&rsquo;s ground to  witness the latest wonder at work, and to arrange with Finley to &ldquo;do&rdquo; their  little patches. M&rsquo;Mahon&rsquo;s old-fashioned concern went out of demand&mdash;they lost  respect for it.</p>
<p>Finley spent all the morning  turning and screwing bolts about and hunting up harness for four horses. And  when at last he mounted the machine and made a start, the comb brushed smoothly  over the heads, and only picked up clomps of &ldquo;wild Irishman&rdquo; and thistles. The  works clogged and buzzed like a corn-sheller with a brick or a clothes-prop  passing through it.</p>
<p>Spectators shook their heads  dubiously, eyed her all over, and said they wouldn&rsquo;t have theirs &ldquo;done&rdquo; by her  at any price. (M&rsquo;Mahon&rsquo;s discarded old implement retrieved its reputation.) One  had a notion there was a mistake&mdash;he was sure he had seen them well-boring in  the West with the same kind of thing. Finley glared and cursed, and kicked the  horses. He tried the machine again, then sent a hasty message to the vendors in  town to come and take the thing home.</p>
<p>Next day the agent arrived at  Finley&rsquo;s, accompanied by an expert&mdash;a man who understood harvesters, a man from  Victoria, who condemned Finley&rsquo;s crop and his horses as soon as he set eyes on  them. He commenced operations by detailing prize performances and show  competitions carried off by that particular brand of harvester. And when any of  those standing round struck savagely at the flies, and remarked how bad they  were, he would look out from under the machine, with five or six in his eye, and  say: &ldquo;You ought t&rsquo; be down in th&rsquo; mallee for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And whilst he poked and fumbled,  and fiddled and climbed about the harvester, putting her straight, the agent, a  broad, priestly-looking man with a rosy face under a large hat, and a white  handkerchief protecting his thick perspiring neck from the sun, dropped in the  shade of the dray and passed eulogies on &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s&rdquo; skilful handling of  harvesters, and in low confiding tones invited the unbelievers to wait till  they saw the work he could get out of her.</p>
<p>The expert mounted the seat and  started the horses. Such a row! Such an empty rumble and rattle! Spectators  followed, guffawing, and pointing out grain strewn in her track, plucking heads  she had missed, and shaking their heads in deprecation at Finley. At the end of  the field the harvester came to a standstill, and the expert left his seat to  adjust the machinery some more. Another start, and a score or more of  stoppages. Then the expert explained to Finley the cause of the failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;th&rsquo;  stuff&rsquo;s all <i>down</i>. No machine in th&rsquo;  world would ever pick <i>that</i> up,&rdquo; and  with his foot he kicked some of it straight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a fair trial; but if  there&rsquo;s any wheat about&rdquo; (looking towards M&rsquo;Mahon&rsquo;s away in the distance) &ldquo;that&rsquo;s  standin&rsquo; at all, I&rsquo;d show y&rsquo; what sort o&rsquo; work she <i>can</i> do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy knew where there was an  ideal crop, and eagerly suggested his own. &ldquo;Straight as a ramrod,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo;  not a weed in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy had never displayed such  sagacity before.</p>
<p>The agent and Finley held a conference.  The agent was sure that if Finley saw the machine in a good, standing crop he&rsquo;d  be satisfied with her. Finley shook his head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, gloomily.  But after a lot of argument he consented to a further trial; and Sandy ran home  and knocked down some of his fence to let the harvester in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit better,&rdquo; the expert  said, assuming a half-satisfied air when he saw Sandy&rsquo;s wheat. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll take  that, I think; but <i>it&rsquo;s</i> not th&rsquo; <i>best</i> crop in th&rsquo; world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s wheat, what there was of  it, was a subject for a painter. It was a fluke, and the expert had never seen  anything like it in the mallee or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Sandy was all energy and anxiety.  The expert complained of Finley&rsquo;s greenhide reins. Sandy rushed and hunted up  the best in his shed, a pair worse than Finley&rsquo;s, and brought them along. The  expert found fault with a swingle-tree; Sandy darted to where his plough lay  rusting in the summer grass at the furthest corner of the cultivation, and  returned with a heavy, clumsy implement he had manufactured himself, on his  shoulder. The agent was thirsty; Sandy bolted off for a bucket of water and a  pint.</p>
<p>Finally everything was fixed, and  the man from the mallee threw the harvester into gear and let her go. Away she  tore, humming, buzzing, chaff and dust flying round her in a thick cloud. This  time she meant business. The onlookers followed, watching the performance  closely. As the result of several rounds four full bags of clean grain were  lifted from her. Every hand present was dipped into them. Everyone was  surprised. They began to regard the harvester as a miracle, and climbed all  over her in search of enlightenment, and looked wise, and said &ldquo;Jusso&rdquo; when  they didn&rsquo;t understand things the expert told them about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; he said triumphantly,  &ldquo;what she could do with a fair show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Finley remained unconvinced.  He was still dissatisfied. So was Sandy. Sandy thought the trial was too short,  and urged a longer one. The agent smiled, but seemed prepared to do anything to  convince Finley. They started again, and Sandy mounted the harvester beside the  expert and accompanied him round and round, praising her work, and calling out &ldquo;She&rsquo;s  a beauty!&rdquo; to the doubtful Finley,</p>
<p>The expert settled down to work,  and kept going till dark, and when the horses were taken out for the day there  was a big hole in Sandy&rsquo;s twelve acres and a broad smile on Sandy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Next day found Finley undecided.  The expert went to work again, and kept Finley&rsquo;s horses moving till the twelve  acres were bagged. And they counted seventy-five bags! Sandy wouldn&rsquo;t believe  it. He counted them himself&mdash; counted them twice. Sandy never felt his bluchers  so light on his feet before, and his eyes seemed to see nothing but money  rolling in.</p>
<p>Yet Finley remained obdurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny,&rdquo; he growled,  stubbornly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t deny at all that that&rsquo;s good work she&rsquo;s done; but I want to  see her take <i>short</i> stuff like she&rsquo;s  took that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if she&rsquo;ll do my barley,&rdquo;  Sandy said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s short enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finley didn&rsquo;t reply. The  purchase-money was on his mind. The expert thought he saw a point in showing  the harvester off in Sandy&rsquo;s barley, and into it he went.</p>
<p>Every round that was made Sandy  loudly lauded the machine; and when she had taken 40 bags off the four acres,  he would have bought her himself, but for Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you make her do mine as well  as she&rsquo;s done that,&rdquo; Finley said to the agent, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the harvester left Sandy&rsquo;s  paddock.</p>
<p>Sandy couldn&rsquo;t rest until the  wheat and barley were carted to the railway and sent away. And when he was  finished loading and unloading those bags, he looked as weary and played-out as  a working bullock turned out to die.</p>
<p>A week later, when a cheque for  &pound;77 arrived, you would think Sandy had drawn the big money in &ldquo;Tattersall&rsquo;s.&rdquo;  The sight of it made him tremble, and his big rough hands couldn&rsquo;t hold the  piece of paper. But Kate was more composed. She took the cheque, examined it,  and perused the statement. Then they went inside, and sat down, and talked  hopefully of farming and of the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>knew</i> we would do well,&rdquo; Kate said, her eyes filling with tears. &ldquo;I  knew we would, once we made a push. An&rsquo; oh! I <i>am</i> glad we&rsquo;ve made such a start&rdquo; (looking at the cheque again), &ldquo;an&rsquo;  we <i>must</i> get on now, Sandy, if we&rsquo;re  careful an&rsquo; saving, an&rsquo; work as we&rsquo;ve been doing. An&rsquo; <i>who</i> knows what we might be yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be better off th&rsquo;n Tyson,&rdquo;  Sandy suggested.</p>
<p>Kate made a calculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s &pound;20,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to go to  the store. Another plough-horse, &pound;10. Six more heifers, &pound;21. Clothes for  yourself, and a few little things for the house, &pound;6. And the other &pound;20&mdash;I&rsquo;m  going to <i>bank</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s big, sleepy eyes opened  wide. The idea of having money in a bank was almost too much for him. He  silently reached for the cheque again, eyed it closely, and spelt it over. And  while he hung fondly over the precious document, Kate broke into more raptures.  She shed tears again, and said she always had a feeling they would get on. &ldquo;An&rsquo;  oh!&rdquo; she burst out, &ldquo;I have often prayed that God would remember us, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; he <i>has</i>, Sandy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Jimmy Parker&rsquo;s Holiday</b></h2>
<p>The Parkers were friends of Sandy&rsquo;s  and Kate&rsquo;s, and lived in town, where they were mostly out of work. Sometimes  Sandy sent them a bag of potatoes; and once Parker sent Sandy a case of fruit,  which the railway people enjoyed.</p>
<p>Jimmy Parker came to Sandy&rsquo;s to  spend a holiday. Jimmy was about fourteen, and had never been to the bush. He  had often longed to see it though; and to become acquainted with cattle and  kangaroos was his ambition. Sandy met him at the railway and took him to the  selection in the dray. Jimmy was delighted to see so much country, and all the  way along nursed a small rifle he had brought with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How &rsquo;re y&rsquo; on kang&rsquo;roos?&rdquo; Sandy  asked, eyeing the weapon. Jimmy said he didn&rsquo;t know. &ldquo;Never had a shot at any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy told him there were  thousands round his place, and boasted of their size and ferocity. Jimmy drew  deep breaths, and his eyes rolled excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you manage,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;when  an old man tackles you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s one of th&rsquo; things y&rsquo; &rsquo;ve  got t&rsquo; look out f&rsquo;r,&rdquo; Sandy answered lightly, giving the old mare the double of  the reins hard on the rump, and making her go a lot slower. &ldquo;The las&rsquo; time one  tackled me.&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I just took &rsquo;im be th&rsquo; throat with me left hand till  I got out me knife; then I stuck it inter &rsquo;im an&rsquo; ripped &rsquo;im right up t&rsquo; th&rsquo;  bloomin&rsquo; mouth, an&rsquo; let a heap o&rsquo; green grass outer &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy shuddered, and suddenly  discovered he had left his pocket-knife at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, while y&rsquo;r up &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; Sandy  said advisedly, &ldquo;you had better borrow mine whenever y&rsquo; go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence for about a mile.</p>
<p>Going down the Gap, near Talty&rsquo;s,  a great noise suddenly broke out. There was wild commotion in the gully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Sandy said, stopping the  dray; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re after somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo; And he stared about. &ldquo;There it comes!&rdquo; he  cried; &ldquo;look out! . . . Get y&rsquo;r rifle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tired, miserable marsupial  floundered towards them, pursued by three of the Talty girls and an old blind  dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sool &rsquo;im, sool &rsquo;im!&rdquo; the girls  were shouting, and the blind dog sooled in moderation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy jumped off the dray and  heaved a waddy vainly at the passing &rsquo;roo, then joined in the chase. But Jimmy  sat still and grinned and wondered. A &rsquo;roo hunt was new to Jimmy.</p>
<p>When the dray arrived at the  selection Kate met it at the rails, and nearly shook Jimmy&rsquo;s hand off. Kate  always got excited when visitors came. She commented on his altered appearance,  asked him how his mother was and how his father was keeping, and if the baby  was walking yet, and why his sister Julia didn&rsquo;t come, and said what a strange  thing it was &ldquo;our boy&rdquo; was called Jimmy too, and finished by inquiring how he  liked Sleepy Creek. Then she foraged in the dray for things Sandy had brought  from the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about tea? Didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; bring  tea?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Sandy threw down a new rake he had  purchased and stared sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clean f&rsquo;got it!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, y&rsquo;re a <i>thing</i>,&rdquo; Kate snapped, &ldquo;why it was what we wanted <i>most</i>, an&rsquo; I <i>told</i> y&rsquo; not t&rsquo; f&rsquo;get it!&rdquo; Kate nearly cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo; got none at all?&rdquo; Sandy  murmured.</p>
<p>Jimmy felt he was in the way, and  strolled over to the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got none?&rdquo; Kate snorted. &ldquo;Of  course I ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy looked very dejected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t f&rsquo;get y&rsquo;r old rotten t&rsquo;bacca,  I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy made no remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yer <i>mighter</i> thought of it!&rdquo; reproachfully. Then she went inside and slipped  out the other door, and went off to Mrs. Hogan&rsquo;s as fast as she could run. Kate  was a great one for tea.</p>
<p>Jimmy removed his hat at the door,  and smoothed his hair with his hand. Sandy kept his on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; know me Uncle?&rdquo; Sandy said,  introducing Jimmy,</p>
<p>Uncle grinned, and leaned round to  shake hands without getting up, and the pumpkin he was sitting on at the fire  rolled, and he slipped off. Sandy laughed. Uncle recovered himself and sat  staring into Jimmy&rsquo;s face as if he was a kangaroo, and made him feel uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull y&rsquo;r boxes up,&rdquo; Sandy said  when tea was ready, and dumped his own down at the head of the table.</p>
<p>They all sat round. Sandy piled  enough corned beef and potatoes and pumpkin on Jimmy&rsquo;s plate to last him a  week, and worried him all through the meal to take more. And when he refused a  third cup of tea, Kate became alarmed about his health. She was sure he was  ill, and suggested he might take a dose of oil or something and go to bed  early. After tea, Sandy proposed a &ldquo;bit o&rsquo; &rsquo;possum shootin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and he and Jimmy  got ready and went out. They mooned about, falling over logs and fouling  brambles and limbs that nearly poked their eyes out, until the moon went down,  but didn&rsquo;t see a solitary &rsquo;possum&mdash;saw nothing at all to blaze at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n funny!&rdquo; Sandy mused. &ldquo;Any  other night they&rsquo;d be thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They returned to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bed made for Jimmy at  the fire,&rdquo; Kate called out from beneath the blankets; and there&rsquo;s some bags at  th&rsquo; foot for him to throw on hisself in th&rsquo; night if he feels cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy assured Sandy he would be  comfortable, and turned in.</p>
<p>When he woke in the morning the  fire was made, and Kate was skipping in and out getting breakfast ready.</p>
<p>Jimmy wished to rise and be about.  But Kate was in the road. He watched her movements closely, and when she went  out the door to yell to Sandy, who was milking at the yard, that breakfast was  ready, he jumped out, grabbed his trousers and faced the fire.</p>
<p>Jimmy never in his life before was  in such haste so early in the morning. He got one leg in, and was dancing about  on it, balancing himself, and kicking and fumbling with the other, when Kate  returned. Jimmy wasn&rsquo;t a precocious youth&mdash;he was sensitive and shy, and Kate  regarded him more as a son than anything else. She took no notice of him, but  went straight to the fire to make the tea.</p>
<p>Jimmy faced the other way then,  and tangled himself up and fell on the bed. Then he snatched the blanket and  covered himself again; he turned red, too, and was in distress. Kate made the  tea, and turned to the table and commenced to hum a tune. After a while, Jimmy  sat up and fumbled with the blanket; and when at last he stood on his feet his  trousers were on.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page125.jpg" alt="jimmy" width="650" height="499"></p>
<p>After breakfast, Jimmy helped  Sandy to yoke the horses; then took the rifle and went in search of kangaroos.  Sandy directed him to a spot where he would find them in millions.</p>
<p>Jimmy tramped round and round the  paddock, and hunted about till the rifle felt heavy as lead and the skin came  off his heels, but saw nothing to fire at, save two little brown birds and a  jew-lizard. He returned, and directed his steps to where Sandy was running  about behind two horses and a plough, and swearing. Sandy was surprised to hear  there were no kangaroos about; he couldn&rsquo;t understand it. For a second or two  he stood, scanning the tree-tops waving over the wire fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gen&rsquo;ally a bear or two about  here,&rdquo; he said, scraping the dust off himself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be any ter-day,  though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy said it didn&rsquo;t matter, and  he looked as if he spoke the truth. Jimmy was getting tired of kangaroo shooting&mdash;  tired of the Bush altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a go at drivin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Sandy  suggested, cheerfully; &ldquo;leave y&rsquo;r rifle here, and take the reins for a while,  and see how y&rsquo; get on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy said he didn&rsquo;t mind  trying&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t say it with any enthusiasm; and in a weary sort of way he  stood up and took the reins. Sandy yelled at the horses; they woke up and made  a rush at different intervals. The plough jumped, stopped, jumped again, then  scratched along after them. Jimmy tried to keep up with it&mdash;he limped, stumbled,  jumped over some clumps of burr, and tripped against dry cornstalks that hadn&rsquo;t  been cut.</p>
<p>Sandy continued to yell at the  horses, struggling all the time to keep his footing. A withered pumpkin-vine  that seemed to be growing all over the paddock, with numerous small pumpkins  dangling to it, got twisted round one of Jimmy&rsquo;s legs. Jimmy kicked frantically  to free himself of it, and fell down.</p>
<p>The horses dragged him along till  he got up again. Sandy didn&rsquo;t notice him; he was battling hard to keep the  plough in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To y&rsquo;!&mdash;<i>to</i> y&rsquo;!&rdquo; Sandy called when the black mare left the furrow. Jimmy  pulled the wrong rein. &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Sandy shouted, losing his temper&mdash;&ldquo;<i>to</i> y&rsquo;!&rdquo; Jimmy pulled the wrong rein some  more; then Sandy threw the handles down savagely, and cried: &ldquo;Blarst it, what&rsquo;s  th&rsquo; good o&rsquo; that?&rdquo; and snatched the reins from Jimmy and nearly dragged the  heads off the horses.</p>
<p>A lump came into Jimmy&rsquo;s throat,  and while the spade was falling heavily on the rumps of the horses he stole  away, feeling mistaken and disappointed in Sandy, the friend of his father.  Near the house he met Kate coming along with a can of tea and some scones and  butter for Sandy&rsquo;s &ldquo;eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was red with the heat and the  haste she was making, but was cheerful as a book-agent. She pressed Jimmy to  return to the plough and have some tea. But Jimmy wasn&rsquo;t hungry, and said he  would sooner &ldquo;mooch about a bit.&rdquo; Kate showed him where he would find Uncle. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  always there,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;ll shift <i>him!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy went to the house and put  the rifle away; then sat in the shade of the verandah and felt lost and lonely.  Not a soul about; scarcely a sound audible! Jimmy wondered how any one could  live in such a place, and began to think of home and the town. Some fowls and a  few turkeys came round, stretched their necks and took side glances at him,  then moved away again.</p>
<p>Jimmy rose and went in search of  Uncle. He found him snoring in a new nest he had made out of an old tent  patched with rag and bagging, standing some distance from the house. Sandy  sometimes used it as a store-room. At the sound of Jimmy&rsquo;s voice, Uncle woke up  with a start, but when he saw it wasn&rsquo;t a policeman or a bushranger, he drew  his legs up to give him room to sit on the corner of the bunk, and went calmly  off to sleep again.</p>
<p>Jimmy stared hard at Uncle, then  at a cat slumbering on top of a bag of flour near his head, which was all the  tent contained. Large flies buzzed about like bees, and Jimmy felt lonelier  than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it from here to the  train?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>No answer. Uncle was fast asleep.</p>
<p>Jimmy touched him on the bare  foot. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how far&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whip-cracks and men&rsquo;s voices  shouting sounded close to the tent. Jimmy rushed out. Two horsemen were in the  grass-paddock, wheeling a wild-looking, black bull toward Sandy&rsquo;s yard. Foam  was flowing from the bull&rsquo;s nostrils and mouth, and his blood was fairly up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out there!&rdquo; the men shouted  when Jimmy showed himself. &ldquo;Look out! Keep <i>inside!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy sheltered himself behind a  large tree, and got excited. The bull saw the tent, and instead of taking  fright went straight at it with his head down. Jimmy clung to the tree and  yelled a warning to Uncle. But Uncle was a hard man to shift. The bull went  right through the tent and levelled it to the ground.</p>
<p>The cat got a great start. It  raced in three different directions before remembering where the house lay;  then to see it light out! But there was no word of Uncle.</p>
<p>Jimmy nearly fainted. The horsemen  shouted hilariously, but they had no idea the tent was inhabited. The bag of  flour attracted the bull&rsquo;s attention; he took it for an enemy, and dug his  horns into it, rooted it about, and bellowed and breathed into it. The flour  clung to his moist nose and hide, and went into dough on him, and turned him  white.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uncle had been lying  low, but the bull tramped on him, and he thought it time to shift. On hands and  knees he emerged from the debris, and crawled some yards; then, like a rat  forsaking a log, he made off as fast as terror and tender feet would allow in  the direction of the house. The bull caught sight of Uncle, and, despite all  attempts of the horsemen to frustrate him, went headlong in pursuit.</p>
<p>Uncle had 50 yards to cover to  reach the house; the bull had 100 yards to go. Talk about excitement! Neither  Jimmy nor the horsemen could speak. They stared and trembled. The bull rattled  over the ground like a racehorse in a straight. You couldn&rsquo;t hear Uncle moving,  but he got a lot out of his arms and head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll <i>have</i> him,&rdquo; one of the men murmured, apprehensively; &ldquo;he will . . .  he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Done</i> it!&rdquo; Jimmy burst out excitedly, just as Uncle threw himself in  the back door, which, happily, was wide open. Then, almost instantly, there was  a loud crash, and the bull and the slabs and the roof of Sandy&rsquo;s new skillion  were wildly mixed up, and the animal was plunging madly about inside with  groceries on his horns.</p>
<p>For a fortnight after, Jimmy was  in high spirits, and never thought of home once.</p>

  Uncle&rsquo;s Arrest</b></h2>
<p>Sandy moped about with sadness in  his face while Uncle, for the second or third time, collected his &ldquo;traps&rdquo; and  bits of things, and packed up to leave the selection. When the time came to  shake hands and say good-bye, Sandy asked Uncle to come back if he felt  dissatisfied; and, forcing back a lump that rose in his throat, mumbled kindly,  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no necessity for y&rsquo; to leave at all; there&rsquo;s plenty o&rsquo; room here,  goodness knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Uncle was an obstinate old  man. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, with a lofty wave of the hand, &ldquo;I told y&rsquo; before, I  couldn&rsquo;t live in a place where there was children.&rdquo; And, with his odds-an&rsquo;-ends tied in a handkerchief, he went off to loaf again on Dad at Ruddville, and  to be a nuisance and a pest to Sarah and Dave and the rest.</p>
<p>Kate fervently thanked heaven that  Uncle had gone, and hoped to goodness he would never return. &ldquo;A blessed  nuisance wherever he is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;scarcely ever did anything . . . and then  never without being asked . . . and when he did it, only made more work for  others!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place &rsquo;ll be lonely without  him,&rdquo; Sandy said, sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a lot better off <i>without</i> him,&rdquo; Kate snapped, and turning  on her heel went away to throw thistles to the pigs.</p>
<p>Three months later.</p>
<p>Sandy in the gully, bursting  himself hauling back panels of the fence that had been taken away and left on  the reserve by the last flood. It was dinner-time, and Kate mounted a ladder  that leaned against a small lucerne stack and coo-eed and waved to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orright,&rdquo; Sandy shouted back.  When he reached the house a pile of potatoes and cabbage, and a plate of fried  bread, just out of the pan, awaited him. Kate was a great one to cook&mdash; she was  one of those who could dish up a meal from almost nothing.</p>
<p>Kate apologised to Sandy for the  absence of meat. &ldquo;Riley&rsquo;s couldn&rsquo;t have killed last night,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or they&rsquo;d  have sent some over to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grunted. Then after  reflecting: &ldquo;Wot about the kangaroo leg I got last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Kate said, rattling the  cups and saucers on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, crickey,&rdquo; Sandy answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  hungry, an&rsquo; kangaroo&rsquo;s not too bad, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took a knife and went out  the back door. In a while he returned with several rounds of fresh &ldquo;steak,&rdquo; and  dropped them enthusiastically into the pan.</p>
<p>Kate grinned. &ldquo;Well, if you will have  it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cook it for you,&rdquo; and took charge of the pan.</p>
<p>She talked away to Sandy about the  fence, and probed and poked hard at the steak. Sandy sat on his haunches  watching the pan and saying, &ldquo;Yairs.&rdquo; The cat mounted the table to procure  something to go on with, and upset the milk. The dog, always hanging about the  door, on the alert, rushed in and fought with the cat for possession of the  fluid as it trickled into a small pool in a hollow of the earthen floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! what&rsquo;s happened <i>now?</i>&rdquo; and Kate flew in. &ldquo;You <i>might</i> look after things a bit when one&rsquo;s  back&rsquo;s turned,&rdquo; she said, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gehout!&rdquo; Sandy yelled, and  getting up kicked the dog in the ribs with one foot, and missed the cat with  the other.</p>
<p>Kate bent over the pan again and  dropped more dripping into it.</p>
<p>Sandy followed the cat out the  front door and round the house. A stray pitchfork diverted his attention. He  lifted it and went to place it in the shed.</p>
<p>The cat glided in again by the  back door and walked round the table, and looked up at the provender. Then it  mounted the cloth and put its head in the milk jug and upset it again. Kate  sprang round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it! <i>Sskat!</i>&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom&rdquo; landed on the floor along  with the jug, and raced out the front door again. Kate rushed to the back one  and met Sandy coming in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish you would watch the cat  for a moment!&rdquo; she whined. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you . . . There&rsquo;s not a drop of  milk, now, for the dinner! . . . and the jug&rsquo;s in pieces, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; <i>cat?</i>&rdquo; Sandy said; &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t th&rsquo; cat; I jus&rsquo; chased &rsquo;im round th&rsquo;  house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Kate snorted, and hurried  back. The cat jumped off the table and flew out the door once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>wretch</i> of a thing!&rdquo; Kate screeched, and rushed after Tom.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page136.jpg" alt="cat" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p>Sandy heard something strike the  wall outside and grinned. The cat, with its back and hair up, raced in at the  back door and flew into the bedroom. It scrambled hurriedly up the bed-post,  then reached the partition, and walked calmly along the beam and looked down on  the dinner-table.</p>
<p>Kate, with a piece of axe-handle  in her hand, followed in pursuit. &ldquo;Where is he gone?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; bedroom,&rdquo; Sandy drawled,  bending over the pan to prod the steak with a knife.</p>
<p>Kate disappeared in the bedroom  and probed beneath the bed with the axe-handle, and said, &ldquo;<i>Psst, psst!</i>&rdquo; But the cat didn&rsquo;t run out. Kate appeared again and  told Sandy to give the brute away to somebody.</p>
<p>Sandy made no reply. He tilted the  pan to distribute the fat equally over the &ldquo;steak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show <i>me</i>,&rdquo; Kate said, throwing down the axe-handle, and seizing the pan  again. In a few moments the &ldquo;steak&rdquo; was cooked, dished, and placed on the  table, and the smell was grand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; Kate said, &ldquo;and  for goodness sake let us have dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy took his place at the table,  and rubbed two knives together. Kate seized the tea-pot and poured the tea out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why kangaroo shouldn&rsquo;t  be as good as other meat,&rdquo; Sandy said, plunging a fork into the flesh, which  didn&rsquo;t jump. &ldquo;It eats grass and drinks water same as bullocks or sheep . . . An&rsquo;  look at pigs, they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow crossed the room, and the  form of a man appeared at the front door. Sandy looked round. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;be&mdash;  blowed,&rdquo; he said, and jumped up and seized the man by the hand.</p>
<p>The man was Uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; was all Kate said, &ldquo;back  again.&rdquo; And she rose and reached down another cup and saucer.</p>
<p>Sandy made a lot of Uncle. He flew  round and found him something to sit on, and planted it at the table for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Avin dinner?&rdquo; Uncle asked, as if  he couldn&rsquo;t see they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time,&rdquo; Sandy said,  rubbing the knives together again. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll y&rsquo; have&mdash;some meat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; how did y&rsquo; leave them all at  Ruddville?&rdquo; Sandy went on, drawing the knife across the &rsquo;roo.</p>
<p>Uncle made no answer till he  started on the steak, then with a full mouth shook his head and said, &ldquo;Had  enough of <i>them</i>. Get all the work they  can out o&rsquo; y&rsquo; for nothin; then y&rsquo; can <i>go!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate flared up and her eyes  flashed fire, but Sandy saved Uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some more steak?&rdquo; he said,  holding up a forkful of the &rsquo;roo, with gravy running from it. Uncle held out  his plate and received a fresh supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think that was  kangaroo?&rdquo; Sandy said, directing Uncle&rsquo;s attention to the dish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought it  were <i>mutton</i>,&rdquo; Uncle answered.</p>
<p>Sandy grinned, and was proceeding  to draw comparisons, when a voice called out at the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers,&rdquo; Kate murmured,  looking through the door.</p>
<p>Sandy left the table and went out.  Three men were there, and they inquired the way to some place of which Sandy  had never heard, and asked for a drink. They went away, and Sandy returned to  his dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like the looks of them  chaps,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Kate rose and looked out. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve  only one swag between them, too,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Uncle took a peep at them. &ldquo;Makin&rsquo;  down th&rsquo; crick,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Country&rsquo;s full o&rsquo; loafers, just now.&rdquo; And he turned  and stretched himself on the sofa and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Two days after.</p>
<p>There was excitement on the Creek.  Old Byrnes&rsquo;s place was broken into, in the middle of the night, and some money  and a silver watch taken. Byrnes sent for the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them chaps done it,&rdquo; Uncle said,  meaning the three strangers who had asked Sandy for a drink. &ldquo;I thought they  was after somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when a policeman came to make  enquiries, Uncle received him sullenly; said he didn&rsquo;t notice anything  suspicious about the men at all. He couldn&rsquo;t say what they were like, either,  or what kind of clothes they had on, or if they had any on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; Kate broke in, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t  you say they looked like thieves or loafers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Who!</i> . . . <i>me?</i>&rdquo; Uncle  answered, looking surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>you</i>,&rdquo; Kate rejoined, confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gran&rsquo;mother!</i>&rdquo; Uncle hissed, and hobbled away.</p>
<p>The policeman gleaned all he could  from Sandy and Kate, then rode off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hidjets!&rdquo; Uncle squealed when the  Law was out of hearing, &ldquo;what did y&rsquo; want t&rsquo; tell him ennerthin&rsquo; for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Kate stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look well if y&rsquo; find y&rsquo;selves  in th&rsquo; witness-box . . . or if y&rsquo; get up and find your horses an&rsquo; cows gone  some mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Uncle went off to catch his  own old hack to ride down the creek in search of fossil bones. Fossil hunting  had become an industry with Uncle. Fossils and Angora goats and gooseberries,  he reckoned, were to become the staple products of Sleepy Creek.</p>
<p>The policeman arrested three men  in an empty hut near the Crossing, and was driving them up the creek same as  you would cows, when he met Uncle.</p>
<p>The Law called a halt. &ldquo;Are these  the chaps you saw?&rdquo; he asked of Uncle; but before Uncle could make answer one  of the prisoners took to his heels and made off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch these two!&rdquo; the policeman  said excitedly to Uncle, and wheeling his horse round, raced in pursuit. The  fugitive, finding he was overtaken, took a turn round a tree, and the Law lost  ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If th&rsquo; trap isn&rsquo;t sharp, Jack &rsquo;ll  lose him,&rdquo; one of Uncle&rsquo;s captives remarked, watching the chase cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will,&rdquo; the other one added; &ldquo;he  will . . . he&mdash; Then he grabbed Uncle by the leg and said, &ldquo;Here, get down an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll  give the bobby a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Uncle could collect his  thoughts he was standing on the ground. The prisoner swung himself into the  saddle, threw away his hat, snatched Uncle&rsquo;s, and galloped off in the opposite  direction.</p>
<p>In a few moments the officer  returned, leading his man on the end of a saddlestrap. &ldquo;Where did that horseman  go who I left here?&rdquo; he said to Uncle.</p>
<p>Uncle stuttered and stammered, and  tried to explain the position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your yarns to me!&rdquo; the  Law said, firmly. &ldquo;Pick up your swag there, and march . . . an&rsquo; the first one  of y&rsquo; that tries to get away again, I&rsquo;ll put a bullet in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle showed his teeth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a <i>hass</i>,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t y&rsquo; see I <i>haint</i> th cove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on there, now,&rdquo; the policeman  said. &ldquo;Pick up that swag and go.&rdquo; And he spurred his horse right up against  Uncle.</p>
<p>Uncle gesticulated and blasphemed,  then took up the other man&rsquo;s dirty bundle and padded along beside his strange  companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be trying to get out of it  like that, old chap,&rdquo; one of them whispered in Uncle&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re our mate  right enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle dropped the bundle and  seized him by the whiskers, and squealed and called him a liar.</p>
<p>He ordered Uncle to &ldquo;let go.&rdquo;  Uncle wouldn&rsquo;t. Then he lifted Uncle off the ground, and swinging him round,  hit the policeman&rsquo;s horse with him. The animal snorted and plunged to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; the Law shouted, fixing an  angry eye on Uncle, &ldquo;clear out; an&rsquo; when you&rsquo;re asked about  anyone again, don&rsquo;t tell lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle hobbled home. &ldquo;I reckon he  can get <i>into</i> it,&rdquo; he declaimed to  Sandy. &ldquo;A policeman can&rsquo;t do that sort of thing?&rdquo; Sandy thought hard, and said  he didn&rsquo;t think he could, either.</p>
<p>But Kate only smiled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  An Appeal to Old Dad</b></h2>
<p>Sandy and Kate were in trouble  again. Following close upon the heels of a few good seasons and some small  successes, came reverses and misfortune. A drought set in. Month after month  went by&mdash;and no rain! A year passed, then two years, and still the drought  raged. The few pounds that Sandy had scraped together, and Kate had saved, went  in feed for the cows; and when that was done, Sandy resorted to falling trees  to keep them alive on the wretched leaves. And then, sick and weary and tired  of it all, he threw down the axe and gave in one day, and the cows died &mdash;every  hoof of them! One by one the horses dropped off&mdash; all but Gypsy, and the Lord  only knows how she managed to survive; and Sandy, broken-hearted, his hopes and  happiness shattered, sat down and cursed the selection, cursed the country, and  cursed himself for having been a deluded, hopeful fool.</p>
<p>Then, one day, large, heavy clouds  climbed over the horizon, and it rained; rained hard for weeks. And the drought  broke; and where nothing but dust and bones had been seen for years, grass and  herbage sprang up, and all the land became green and grand again.</p>
<p>Kate, who was always brave, took  fresh heart when she saw the country looking well, and talked encouragingly to  Sandy, and said if they could only manage to make another start there might  never be a drought again. But Sandy only sighed, and said he could see no  earthly way of making another start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad has made a lot of money,&rdquo;  Kate said thoughtfully, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if you asked him, perhaps he might lend us a  hundred pounds, and we could pay him back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned a grim sort of grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d <i>ask</i> him,&rdquo; Kate went on; and, after a long silence, Sandy said he  would.</p>
<p>At Ruddville we were getting  ground ready for wheat, and all of us were busy, especially Dad. He was bobbing  up everywhere, trying to be in half-a-dozen places all at once.</p>
<p>Dave went off to the ploughs,  leading three horses; Joe followed with three more.</p>
<p>Barney, the new man, a few minutes  later, was throwing the harness on his set. Dad happened along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; going t&rsquo; be here all day?&rdquo; he  roared. The man nearly fell down. He fumbled with the coupling-strap, but  failed to fasten it, and hurried the horses away without giving any answer.</p>
<p>Dad shuffled to the rear of the  stable, where Lion, a draught horse, was invalided. Dad tried him with a  fistful of new hay. Lion refused.</p>
<p>Sneezer Wingfield rode into the  yard and asked Dad could he lend him a horse for a few days to draw his chaff  to the railway. Dad ignored Sneezer&rsquo;s presence. He poured the balance of a  bottle of saltpetre into Lion&rsquo;s nostrils, then began rubbing hard about the  flanks, and whistling encouragingly to him.</p>
<p>Sneezer repeated his remark. Dad  got annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where th&rsquo; devil d&rsquo; y&rsquo; expect I c&rsquo;n  get horses from t&rsquo; lend ye?&rdquo; he snapped, turning round and glaring savagely at  Sneezer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe y&rsquo; <i>had</i> one, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Sneezer murmured,  and went away. He returned again, accompanied by Bill. Bill and Sneezer were  close friends. Bill sometimes took Sneezer&rsquo;s sister out riding.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page146.jpg" alt="sister" width="487" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Bill, approaching his  parent with great respect, &ldquo;Gypsy&rsquo;s down th&rsquo; paddock there doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;; I s&rsquo;pose  Sneezer c&rsquo;n have th&rsquo; lend of her, Dad, to draw their&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why th&rsquo; devil don&rsquo;t he go  an&rsquo; <i>get</i> her?&rdquo; Dad yelled,  interrupting him. &ldquo;Does &rsquo;e want <i>me</i> t&rsquo;  go runnin&rsquo; after &rsquo;er fer &rsquo;im?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sneezer smiled, and went and got  Gypsy.</p>
<p>Dad trotted across to the ploughs,  and worried Dave and Joe for an hour; then returned and yelled at Sarah to know  why the deuce she left the door of the dairy open, and threatened to sell out  and go and live in town by himself if &ldquo;th&rsquo; damn place isn&rsquo;t looked after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young man, clean-shaved, and  wearing a straw hat and breeches and boots, rode up to the gate on a grey  horse, shod all round and well-groomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dairy inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are?&rdquo; said Dad, with a  surly stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes-s,&rdquo; nervously returned the  other.</p>
<p>Dad lifted a back-band that was  hanging on the fence, put it in the stable, and was walking off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to inspect <i>all</i> the dairies round here,&rdquo; the  official remarked, by way of reminding Dad of his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad grunted, &ldquo;I should &rsquo;a&rsquo;  expected t&rsquo; find a man with a stronger growth of hair on his face fer th&rsquo;  inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the other said  mildly. &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps it would surprise you to know that I&rsquo;m also a veterinary  surgeon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It <i>did</i> surprise Dad, as his face showed. But he thought of Lion, and  his expression changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, if y&rsquo; <i>are</i>, me boy,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the very man I want. Come  round here and look at Lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the inspector wished to see  the dairy first; and Dad, after hesitating, conducted him there. The inspector  complimented Dad on the appearance of the butter. Dad received his remarks in  silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better shift these old cases  out of this, though, I think?&rdquo; &mdash;and the official pointed to a pair of good  butter-boxes, built in town specially for Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; Dad snorted, showing  the white of his eye, &ldquo;do you know a butter-box when you see one?</p>
<p>The officer scanned them closely  again, and seemed in a quandary. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he stammered, looking at the door, &ldquo;the  dairy is built too near the pigsty, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, me shaver,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;when  you own this proputty you can put the dairy where you d&mdash;n well like; but just  now, let me tell y&rsquo;, it belongs to <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my duty, though, Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad interrupted him. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo;  he shouted, &ldquo;do <i>you</i> know, me boy,  that the Gov&rsquo;nor an&rsquo; th&rsquo; Premier of th&rsquo; country have been in this dairy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The official said he wasn&rsquo;t aware  of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course, you wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dad  snarled. Then, raising his voice to squealing pitch, and poking his hairy chin  into the other&rsquo;s face: &ldquo;Well, then, they <i>have</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inspector got uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better see th&rsquo; <i>horse</i>,&rdquo; Dad growled, showing the way to  the door; and when the inspector stepped out he pulled it to violently and  turned the key.</p>
<p>They walked across the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a doctor, as you say  you are,&rdquo; Dad grumbled, &ldquo;then y&rsquo; know all th&rsquo; ins an&rsquo; outs, as well as every  bone and muscle, of a horse&rsquo;s body. . . . Now, tell me what&rsquo;s up with <i>him!</i>&rdquo; &mdash;pointing to the sick horse.</p>
<p>The inspector threw off his coat,  walked round Lion a few times, and eyed him closely. Then he took him by the  head, peered into his mouth, into his eyes, and examined both ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter with him,&rdquo; he  said, turning to Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Dad blurted out, and  hobbled away a yard or two. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; might just&mdash; Pshaw!&rdquo; he broke out again, walking  off another yard or two. . . . &ldquo;Y&rsquo; might as well &rsquo;samine his <i>tail</i> now, yeejit! Look here!&rdquo; &mdash;(Dad  flung out his arm furiously)&mdash; &ldquo;d&rsquo; y&rsquo; see that gate? Now, get through it as  quick as y&rsquo; can, or I&rsquo;ll make an inspector o&rsquo; y&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The official mounted his horse and  went over to Regan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Bill was trying to hunt a bullock  out of the big yard into the killing pen&mdash;a rowdy brute it was, too, just off  the range, and Bill wasn&rsquo;t taking any risks.</p>
<p>Dad came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take &rsquo;im quietly; take &rsquo;im  quietly,&rdquo; he shouted&mdash; &ldquo;rushin&rsquo; &rsquo;im about; what&rsquo;s th&rsquo; use o&rsquo; that? Want th&rsquo; meat  ter go bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep back out o&rsquo; there,&rdquo; Bill  called out in warning as Dad crawled through the rails, &ldquo;<i>you</i> ain&rsquo;t quick enough t&rsquo; keep out of <i>his</i> way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dad entered and leisurely  strode across the yard, the bullock staring fiercely at him, and walked into  the killing-pen and stood there in full view of the beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now give him a start, Bill!&rdquo; he  shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll give <i>you</i> a start,&rdquo; Bill shouted back, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t have some sense an&rsquo;  get out o&rsquo; there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; whelp! is that all y&rsquo; know yet  about pennin&rsquo; a bullock?&rdquo; And Dad marched right out of the pen and courageously  shook his hat at the beast. The bullock instantly charged. Dad turned and  hurriedly led the way back into the pen. The bullock bounded in at his heels.  Dad dexterously popped behind the large swing gate, opening into the pen, and  with a bang and a chuck shoved it shut; then, as the enraged bull swung round  and located him, dived to escape under the bottom rail. But Dad didn&rsquo;t  calculate correctly. Only his head went under the rail&mdash;the rest of him jammed.  The beast made a great dust and knelt on Dad and bellowed in his ear and  knocked splinters off the rails with his horns, just above his head. Dad yelled  to Bill. Bill rushed up and shoved the gate in, and the bullock plunged through  into the big yard again.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page151.jpg" alt="bull" width="650" height="432"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; Dad howled when he  got up; &ldquo;what th&rsquo; devil did y&rsquo; want t&rsquo; open th&rsquo; gate fer an&rsquo; let &rsquo;im out again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad was an ungrateful parent.</p>
<p>A man with a pack on his back, a  billy-can in one hand, and a wretched skeleton of a horse towing behind him,  passed the gate. Three children were on the back of the horse&mdash;stowed away  amongst a pile of bedding and tin dishes and things; a lame woman without boots  limped beside the horse, poking it at intervals with a stick. Two miserable  dogs slunk behind the woman.</p>
<p>The family looked up and stared at  the house, but didn&rsquo;t call. At the hay shed, further down, they saw Cranky Jack  mowing lucerne. The man asked Jack for a bit of hay for the horse. Jack was  nothing if he wasn&rsquo;t generous. He opened the rails and led the animal into the  shed where Dad&rsquo;s best hay was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t many like you about,&rdquo;  the man said to Jack, with gratitude in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice horse that, Jim,&rdquo; Jack  remarked after staring long and vacantly at the sad object. There was a lot of  unconscious humour in Jack.</p>
<p>The nomads sat on the ground and  rested while the horse took its fill of Dad&rsquo;s hay. Jack went on mowing. Dad  rushed on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told y&rsquo; t&rsquo; put that d&mdash;d horse  in here?&rdquo; he roared at the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; the man answered  quietly, pointing to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it out,&rdquo; Dad yelled,  slashing the brute on the head with his old hat and digging the toe of his boot  into its stomach.</p>
<p>The man jumped up in a rage, and  swore, and kicked Dad twice. Then there was a fight. Dad&rsquo;s own account of  battles he had fought had often impressed us, but now he seemed to lose all his  skill. The man got all over him, but Dad caught him round the waist, and down  they went in each other&rsquo;s arms among the hay&mdash;Dad underneath.</p>
<p>Then the enemy mobilised. The lame  woman joined in, and threw hay on Dad&rsquo;s head and prevented him seeing, while  the man squeezed his windpipe. Cranky Jack threw down the scythe, jammed a  finger into each of his ears, and grinned and grimaced. Jack was a useless man  in a row. But just then Sandy, Kate, and little Jimmy came driving along in  their dray, and Dad&rsquo;s life was saved.</p>
<p>At dinner Dad said he didn&rsquo;t  remember such a busy morning for a long while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  A Hundred Pounds</b></h2>
<p>Sandy and Kate and Jimmy had been  a week at Ruddville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;ll go home this evening,&rdquo;  Sandy said to Kate one morning, &ldquo;an&rsquo; see if there&rsquo;s anything can be done. Might  be able to do a bit o&rsquo; ploughin&rsquo; or somethin&rsquo;&mdash;but I dunno!&rdquo; And they walked  slowly down the yard together and sat on the wood-heap, and looked lonely and  sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you spoken to Dad yet about  the money?&rdquo; Kate asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Sandy said, scratching  the ground with a chip, and reflecting; &ldquo;can never get a chance t&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Dad hobbled past,  swearing and shouting, and heaving sticks at a colt that was pawing at a bag of  corn standing near the door of the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go an&rsquo; speak to him now,&rdquo; Kate  said encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think he&rsquo;d give it?&rdquo; Sandy  murmured timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might&mdash;you can&rsquo;t tell; there,  he&rsquo;s gone into the barn,&rdquo; and Kate followed Dad&rsquo;s movements with her eyes.  Sandy rose slowly, hitched his pants, and slouched towards the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out o&rsquo; this,&rdquo; Dad yelled within, &ldquo;out  o&rsquo; this, you wretches!&rdquo; And he threw rakes and things about, and banged the  walls of the building. A dozen or more cackling fowls flew out the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eatin&rsquo; th&rsquo; corn?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eatin&rsquo; it!&rdquo; Dad howled; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re  always at it, th&rsquo; rubbish!&rdquo; And he started pulling the sacks about and  straightening them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a great nuisance about a  place is fowls,&rdquo; Sandy remarked politely, and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Dad shouted, &ldquo;if  th&rsquo; doors was kept shut as they should be. . . Look <i>there!</i>&rdquo; indicating a few grains of corn escaping from a small hole  in a sack, &ldquo;look at <i>that!</i>&mdash;them  infernal fellers&rdquo; (meaning Dave and Joe) &ldquo;never look after a d&mdash;n thing! They&rsquo;d  see that hole there all their lives, and wouldn&rsquo;t put a stitch in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy placed his hand on the sack  Dad had complained of, and the grain escaped a little faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it, don&rsquo;t make it worse,  ye eejit!&rdquo; Dad shouted.</p>
<p>Sandy stood off, and was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be a grain of it left  d&rsquo;rec&rsquo;ly,&rdquo; Dad groaned, and went off to the house to procure a packing needle.</p>
<p>Sandy sat on the bags for a while  pondering, then went out and rejoined Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him?&rdquo; Kate asked hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs, I <i>saw</i> him,&rdquo; Sandy drawled&mdash;(Kate&rsquo;s eyes opened wide)&mdash;&ldquo;but that was  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t you ask him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Sandy answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see him in a minit.&rdquo; Kate got annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how the <i>diggins</i> could I ask him?&rdquo; Sandy whined.</p>
<p>Dad came trotting from the house  again. &ldquo;Ask him now,&rdquo; Kate said in an undertone.</p>
<p>Sandy stood up and hitched his  trousers again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Three</i> needles there yesterday!&rdquo; Dad growled as he approached Sandy,  &ldquo;an&rsquo; not a d&mdash;n one to be found anywhere now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was going to say something,  but just then Joe returned from the Railway Station, and drove into the yard  with a large case in the cart containing the things which Dad had bought for us  when he was in Brisbane. At sight of the case Dad&rsquo;s manner changed, and he  forgot all about the leak in the corn bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it round to the front,&rdquo; he  said cheerfully, then hobbled after Joe.</p>
<p>All of us, including Sandy and  Kate, gathered round the cart, and when we saw the size of the case we wondered  at Dad&rsquo;s liberality, and hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t be long before he would take another  trip to Brisbane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; Dad said, attacking  the lid with a tomahawk and scattering scraps of pine over everyone; &ldquo;stand  away till I open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stood away and waited like  youngsters round a Christmas-tree. A portion of the lid came away with a loud  tear and disclosed a collection of extraordinary-looking merchandise. You&rsquo;d  think Dad had bought a pawnshop or the rights to a vacant allotment.</p>
<p>Mother plunged her hand into a  corner of the receptacle to secure something for Sarah. Dad shoved her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take y&rsquo;r time!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everything  &rsquo;ll be got out d&rsquo;rec&rsquo;ly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some more pine was shattered, then  Dad hung over the opening and plunged both hands deep into the case. He dragged  out some old leather with stirrup irons attached to it, which might once have  been a saddle, and said enthusiastically: &ldquo;Here y&rsquo; are, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom couldn&rsquo;t contain himself. He  reached eagerly for his prize, and backed away with it in his arms and gloated  over it. Dave and Joe grinned at Tom&rsquo;s saddle.</p>
<p>Bill, who had just arrived, rushed  in and squeezed between Sandy and Kate, and made Sandy tramp on Mother&rsquo;s corn,  and hung over the box, and cried: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s for me, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it! have patience and  let me get at the things!&rdquo; Dad said, and glared at Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have y&rsquo; any more o&rsquo; them saddles?&rdquo;  Joe asked, grinning behind Dad&rsquo;s back. Dad dug into the case again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to  put on that red cow,&rdquo; &mdash;and hanked out a large bullock-bell with a crack in it.  Joe took possession of the bell and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a thing you&rsquo;ve been  wanting long enough,&rdquo; and Dad handed Dave an ancient rust-eaten screw-jack.  Dave sat on his haunches and examined it. Joe rang the bullock bell in Dad&rsquo;s  ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill! Where&rsquo;s Bill?&rdquo; Bill was  there.</p>
<p>Dad put a pair of leggings into  his hands. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re for the yard,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Bill grabbed the present; and,  sitting down on the verandah, straightway commenced to pull them on. Joe rang  the bullock bell in Dad&rsquo;s ear again. Dad jumped round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul, fellow,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t  you keep it quiet fer a minit? &ldquo;</p>
<p>Joe exchanged grins with Dave.  Barty pressed forward and clamoured for his share. Dad wiped perspiration off  himself, and shouted: &ldquo;If y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t keep y&rsquo;r head out of it and stand back I&rsquo;ll  shut th&rsquo; d&mdash;n thing up altogether!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe urged everyone to stand back. &ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;expect Dad t&rsquo; give y&rsquo; any of the new things he&rsquo;s bought if y&rsquo;  won&rsquo;t let him get them out.&rdquo; Sandy chuckled and moved away.</p>
<p>Dad produced a brace, several  rusty bits, a lock without a key, a small entering wedge, and two odd spurs,  all of which he loaded Joe with. Joe smiled, and planted them down carefully on  the verandah, then turned them over with the toe of his boot and contemplated  them curiously.</p>
<p>Tom made a discovery. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y  one spring-bar in this saddle, Dad!&rdquo; he whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never is any more,&rdquo; Joe  said, &ldquo;in <i>them</i> sort.&rdquo; Dave and Sandy  and Sarah guffawed.</p>
<p>Then Bill made complaint. &ldquo;These  ain&rsquo;t mates, Dad,&rdquo; he said, holding up the leggings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some window things,&rdquo;  Dad murmured, ignoring Bill, and raking among the rubbish.</p>
<p>Bill appealed again. &ldquo;D&mdash;n it!&rdquo; Dad  shouted, turning on him, &ldquo;if y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t like them, leave them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a lull. &ldquo;Here they  are!&rdquo; and Dad fished out a pair of spring roller blinds, and handed them to  Mother. Mother explained the mechanism of them to Sarah and Kate. She said all  the places in Brisbane were fitted up with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the hammer?&rdquo; Dad asked,  abandoning the case. No one could find the hammer, but Barty produced the  tomahawk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where&rsquo;s some tacks?&rdquo; Dad  said. Mother found a packet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s yer blind?&rdquo; Sarah brought  one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep out o&rsquo; th&rsquo; way, can&rsquo;t y&rsquo;?&rdquo;  and Dad shoved Barty against the  table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is the inside, an&rsquo; which is the out?&rdquo;&mdash;and Dad twirled  and twisted the blind about. Mother explained. Dad placed the roller on the  table and tacked the blind to it with the tomahawk. We looked on curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wood&rsquo;s to go at the bottom I  s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; Dave said. Dad chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bad as the cove at th&rsquo; museum,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;who thought kangaroos stung with their tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of us laughed. We knew it  would please Dad. And Dad straightened up and laughed hard at Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Screws would be the best,&rdquo; Mother  said, watching Dad closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nails is just as good,&rdquo; Dad  answered; &ldquo;a lot better, in fact.&rdquo; Then he lifted the tomahawk and bruised his  thumb with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s th&rsquo; matter?&rdquo; Mother asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why th&rsquo; devil th&rsquo;  hammer can&rsquo;t be found,&rdquo; Dad groaned, &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s wanted.&rdquo; And he sucked his  thumb.</p>
<p>After a while Dad mounted a chair,  and fastened the brackets to the wall. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re upside down,&rdquo; Mother said,  looking squarely at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why th&rsquo; devil couldn&rsquo;t some  of y&rsquo; say so before?&rdquo; Dad growled, proceeding to remove them.</p>
<p>He fastened those brackets on  again, and all of us got stiff necks watching him. &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;hand  up the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother handed him the roller with  the blind attached. &ldquo;Be sure you&rsquo;ve got it alright,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Dad held it above his head and  examined it. &ldquo;The other way,&rdquo; Mother said. Dad turned it. Mother began to  think. &ldquo;N-n-no,&rdquo; she stammered; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not it; the other way was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Dad roared, looking down at  her, &ldquo;which is it? I can&rsquo;t put the d&mdash;n thing on <i>both</i> ways!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; and Dad decided for  himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too close,&rdquo; Dave drawled, when he  saw the roller reached a foot beyond the brackets. Dad stared at the wall. We  grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should have measured it first,&rdquo;  Joe chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all know a devil of a lot  about it now,&rdquo; Dad growled; then extended the brackets and tried the roller  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too short,&rdquo; Joe chuckled. Then  Dad swore, and smashed the bracket into a lot of small pieces with the  tomahawk, and made a big dinge in the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about it,&rdquo; Mother  said quietly; &ldquo;never mind it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dad wouldn&rsquo;t be beat. He  mounted the chair again, and persevered and swore till the thing went into  place. &ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; he said triumphantly, stepping to the floor, &ldquo;how does it go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tugged the blind. It didn&rsquo;t  move. We grinned. Dad tugged it again. It still refused to move. Then he took  it in both hands and tore it down and threw it outside, and went away and sat  on the verandah.</p>
<p>Sandy followed Dad to the  verandah, and sat down within a few feet of him, and patted the boards  restlessly with his foot. Dad mopped his brow with a handkerchief, and puffed  and groaned, but took no notice of Sandy. Several times Sandy cleared his  throat.</p>
<p>There was a long interval of  silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have t&rsquo; be making a start  fer home this evenin,&rdquo; Sandy said, gazing gloomily at the verandah boards, &ldquo;an&rsquo;  get to work again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Dad grunted, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  nothin&rsquo; to be got idlin&rsquo; about, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see how anything&rsquo;s to be  got now,&rdquo; Sandy murmured despondently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; to do anythin&rsquo; with.  Everythin&rsquo; went in the drouth, and we haven&rsquo;t even <i>one</i> cow left out of th&rsquo; twenty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad grunted again, and stared  across the landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate an&rsquo; me,&rdquo; Sandy went on,  fumbling nervously with his fingers, &ldquo;were thinkin&rsquo; that perhaps you could lend  us a hundred pound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whaht!&rdquo; Dad bellowed, bounding  off the chair and throwing up his arms. &ldquo;WHAHT!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would pay it back again,&rdquo;  Sandy concluded humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>mad!</i>&rdquo; Dad yelled, tearing up and down the verandah like an enraged  lion; &ldquo;<i>Mad!</i> Lend <i>you</i> a hundred <i>pounds!</i> . .  Where the devil would <i>I</i> get a hundred  pounds?&rdquo;&mdash;turning round and facing poor Sandy. &ldquo;Go an&rsquo; <i>work</i>, an&rsquo; <i>earn</i> a hundred  pounds the same as I had to&mdash;same as anyone has to. . . . A HUNDRED POUNDS!&rdquo; And  his voice shook the very roof.</p>
<p>Mother heard him and hurried to  the verandah, pale and alarmed-looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend you a hundred pounds!&rdquo; Dad  went on, &ldquo;to sit down with, I suppose, an&rsquo; spend an&rsquo; loaf on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy couldn&rsquo;t bear any more. He  jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your money!&rdquo; he roared in a  broken voice and with tears in his eyes; &ldquo;I can get on without it. I&rsquo;m d&mdash;n  sorry ever I asked you for it. . . . Keep it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he hurried into the yard,  shoved the horse into the dray, helped Kate to climb to her seat, and drove  away.</p>
<p>For a good while Dad stormed  through the house, kicking chairs and things out of his way, and every now and  again shouting &ldquo;<i>A hundred pounds!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother and Sarah watched the dray  roll away, then went into the kitchen and sat and talked about Kate and cried.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dad calmed down, and was  silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a hard time, poor girl!&rdquo;  Mother said, and sobbed more.</p>
<p>Presently Dad moved about again,  and called loudly for Bill. Bill went to him, and Dad said: &ldquo;Here, get a horse  and catch up to your sister and give this to her,&rdquo; And he handed Bill a cheque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A &rsquo;undered!&rdquo; Bill shouted, as he  passed the kitchen door on his way to the yard.</p>
<p>Dad went and sat on the verandah  again, and Mother and Sarah dried their eyes in their aprons and joined him.</p>
<p>Then the shades of evening  lengthened out, and the sun went down on the golden-tinted wheat-fields&mdash;on the  rolling grassy plains&mdash;on the timbered tablelands, and on the homes and  homesteads of this new land&mdash;this great land&mdash;our own broad bright Bushland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  A Distinguished Visitor</b></h2>
<p>Next day was the day remembered by  everyone&mdash;the day the O&rsquo;Briens and the Bradys fell out, and fought in the lane,  and Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien bit off Brady&rsquo;s finger&mdash;the day Mrs. Mathers and Mrs. Andy  Mullens left for Brisbane, to see the Exhibition, and took their luggage in a  cradle and two tea-tins.</p>
<p>Distinguished visitors&mdash;a Minister  of the Crown and several M&rsquo;s P.&mdash;were coming to Ruddville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinny&rdquo; Donoghue, our reputed &ldquo;useless&rdquo;  member, was the cause of it. He had arranged with Dad to meet the party, supply  saddle-horses, and escort it to the Falls and Parker&rsquo;s Point, twelve miles  along the range. Attractive scenery abounded at those places, and the party was  to spend a day or so viewing it. Nothing could have pleased Dad more. He was in  his element. He would have found horses for a hundred had it been necessary.</p>
<p>The party arrived. No band&mdash;no  address&mdash;no presentation&mdash;no distinguished gathering, except the Regans and Kelly  and Thompson&rsquo;s men leaning over the fence.</p>
<p>The dogs barked a welcome, and Dad  introduced the visitors to Mother and Sarah, who felt flustered and tried  desperately to appear composed. Then he treated them to refreshments. Lots of  people round our way reckoned a Minister wouldn&rsquo;t touch spirits; but they  couldn&rsquo;t have entertained any at their places. This one touched it; the whole  party did except Mr. Julius A. Stanley. But he wasn&rsquo;t a Member of Parliament;  he was only with the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Stanley said, stalking  about the room, composedly inspecting the enlarged portraits hanging on the  wall; &ldquo;never touch it when I&rsquo;m in the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad looked at him and stared. Dad  had never known anyone to refuse before.</p>
<p>Some of the visitors smiled. The  Minister, Mother thought, frowned. We heard afterwards that he didn&rsquo;t approve  of Stanley&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Stanley was a heroic person. A  person, too, uncommonly full of assurance; with an overweening predilection for  heavy words, and afflicted with a delusion that his frame and constitution were  of cast iron.</p>
<p>Before starting to the Range, Dad  invited the party to &ldquo;have a look round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They inspected the machinery, the  dairy, and the cows. The Minister was delighted. The things he saw seemed to  make him regret his own humble avocation. He said he envied Dad, and spoke of  the freedom and independence of a farmer&rsquo;s life, and loudly repined because  there weren&rsquo;t millions of men with Dad&rsquo;s industry and intelligence on the land.  (He paid the same compliment to a gathering of settlers at Black Duck three  days later.)</p>
<p>But Stanley was not so impressed by  the surroundings. Queensland dairymen, <i>he</i> reckoned, began at the wrong end. Stanley was a plain-spoken man. He said it  would pay most of them, before commencing operations, to sit down and find out  how much they knew about a cow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that waster of a heifer,  there,&rdquo; he remarked, pointing, by way of illustration, to Silky, a  nine-year-old cow; &ldquo;a Hereford, right enough; but see the udder she has&mdash;all <i>flesh</i>. She wouldn&rsquo;t keep a cat in milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silky was the best milker we had;  a shorthorn that Dad had paid thirteen guineas for.</p>
<p>Dad tried to explain these things  to Stanley, but the latter turned a torrent of rhetoric on Dad, and confused  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she was sold as a shorthorn  to me,&rdquo; Dad mumbled in conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I say,&rdquo; Stanley retorted;  &ldquo;and, <i>a fortiori</i>, YOU were sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister showed displeasure.  He scowled, and Joe overheard him say things about Stanley to Mr. Fitzgerald,  Member for Up-North.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bloodwood,&rdquo; Stanley observed,  placing both hands on a yard railing as though he would pull it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ironbark,&rdquo; Dad said, correcting  him. &ldquo;Split on the ridge there,&rdquo; pointing with his finger.</p>
<p>Stanley made grimaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, man,&rdquo; he said, eyeing the  timber closely, &ldquo;not a rail of it. <i>Eucalyptus  corymbosa!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad was knocked out.</p>
<p>Ready to start. Joe, who with Dad  was to accompany the expedition, led out the horses and was allotting each his  mount.</p>
<p>Stanley waved him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I  require no horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>fifteen</i> mile,&rdquo; Dad put in, staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make no difference if it were <i>thirty</i>,&rdquo; Stanley answered, buttoning his  coat up, &ldquo;only exercise to a man when he&rsquo;s done his sixty and seventy in a day,  carrying a rifle and tomahawk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several of his friends tried to  persuade him to change his mind, but in vain. Stanley expanded his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to stir your mokes  up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to keep <i>me</i> in sight.&rdquo;  Then, taking a piece of bramble in his hand for a walking-stick, he started off  through the paddocks, making strides that provoked Dave and Sarah to merriment and  the Minister to expressions of resentment. The mounted division followed.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant day, all  sunlight and brightness. The two-mile hut was passed, Stanley still swinging  along, well in the lead. Dad reckoned he was an extraordinary man.</p>
<p>Joe, with finger and mouth,  whistled like a locomotive. Stanley glanced back over his shoulder. Joe waved  his hand to indicate a change of course. Stanley swung into line without  shortening his stride. The party laughed&mdash;all except the Minister. He was a man  without freedom or gaiety.</p>
<p>Five miles were covered. Stanley&rsquo;s  action become erratic. He puffed, sweated. Gradually he &ldquo;came back&rdquo; to the  horses. Burr and grass-seed clung to his clothes. Gullies, undergrowth, and  patches of blady growth impeded his path, broke his pace. The smallest stone, a  stick, the slightest unevenness in the earth caused him to trip.</p>
<p>Six miles. Stanley fell in the  rear; removed his coat and carried it on his shoulder. Dad became concerned. He  dropped back and invited Stanley to hang on to the stirrup.</p>
<p>Stanley wouldn&rsquo;t. He declined with  a shake of the head. He didn&rsquo;t speak; he couldn&rsquo;t. Dad rode along beside his  guest in silence. Stanley removed his collar and hat, and carried them in his  hand.</p>
<p>Five miles more to tramp. The  Horsemen were out of sight. Dad became agitated. &ldquo;Look here.&rdquo; he said, coming  to a standstill and sliding off his mare: &ldquo;you get up &mdash;I&rsquo;ll walk the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanley sank in the grass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the first time,&rdquo; he gasped, when he had recovered sufficient breath, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve  done any walking in this sort of country.&rdquo; Then he mounted the mare and  encouraged Dad, who blundered feebly along, with cheerful chunks of information  about the fauna and flora of the Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>The mounted division had arrived  at the Falls, and dismounted at an old hut there. &ldquo;Confounded shame!&rdquo; said the  Minister when Stanley hove in sight, perched on Dad&rsquo;s mare, while Dad himself  staggered along on foot. None of the others spoke. They stared. A sort of  depression was over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; Stanley called out as  he came up&mdash;&ldquo;only my friend here <i>would</i> insist upon getting down to stretch his limbs, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been far behind  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad was too exhausted to say  anything. He drank a lot of water, and then sat and wiped the perspiration from  his face. After resting, the party put in a few hours sight-seeing and  shooting. Then they returned to the hut, had tea, and smoked.</p>
<p>When the moon rose they went off  again and mooched round for wallabies. Stanley wouldn&rsquo;t carry a gun. Said he didn&rsquo;t  want any. He walked beside Dad all the time, watching for game for him. His  eyes were better than Dad&rsquo;s, and he saw the things first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady! <i>steady!</i>&rdquo; he would whisper when anything presented itself, and Dad  would stand still and peer excitedly all round the compass. Then Stanley,  without moving his eyes from the object, would reach out his hand and  noiselessly take the gun from Dad and fire it off. He would always hand it back  again, though, and wait till Dad rammed another charge into her.</p>
<p>Dad didn&rsquo;t remonstrate, but he was  struck with a brilliant idea. He stuffed a heavy double charge into the old gun,  and prowled along beside his exuberant guest with a wicked grin on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; Stanley whispered  hoarsely, as the white front of a wallaby showed itself right under their  noses.</p>
<p>Dad held out the gun to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; Stanley said, &ldquo;<i>you</i> haven&rsquo;t had a shot yet. Be quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus adjured, Dad tremblingly  raised the weapon, fired, and fell flat on his back.</p>
<p>All were preparing to turn in,  making their beds on the floor of the hut. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a <i>rug</i>, sir?&rdquo; Dad asked of Stanley, much concerned.</p>
<p>Stanley hadn&rsquo;t. Never carried one  in his life. &rsquo;Twas always his practice, he said, to sleep without covering of  any kind. All he required was something level to lie on&mdash; the harder it was the  sounder he could sleep.</p>
<p>A slab table stood in the centre  of the hut, its legs fixed in the earth. With calm indifference Stanley mounted  that table, stretched himself full length upon it, folded his arms across his  chest, closed his eyes&mdash;and was asleep.</p>
<p>Those on the floor grinned and  compared him to Gladstone. But the Minister shook his head sceptically and  tucked his rug about himself.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour and all were  snoring&mdash;all but Joe. He was interested in Stanley, and lay with an eye on the  table. Stanley didn&rsquo;t sleep very long. He raised himself cautiously and, by the  light of the moon and the flickering fire, stared at the slumbering forms  beneath. Then he slipped quietly from the table and crawled under Dad&rsquo;s rug.</p>
<p>Dad must have thought it was  Mother; he put his arms round Stanley and murmured things about &ldquo;calves&rdquo; and &ldquo;milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At daybreak Stanley took to the  table again, and when the others opened their eyes he was sleeping loudly.</p>
<p>Breakfast. Then some more  sight-seeing and shooting. After a light lunch, made off the remains of the provender,  they spoke of returning. Joe packed up and got the horses ready.</p>
<p>Stanley, his chest pushed out and  head tilted back, strode leisurely forward and mounted Dad&rsquo;s mare. &ldquo;Come along,  Johnson,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you and I&rsquo;ll be going on.&rdquo; They rode off.</p>
<p>Seeing Dad on foot, the Minister  hesitated, and stared about. He saw Stanley in advance, waving his hand in  debate with Johnson, and grasped the position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too d&mdash;d bad!&rdquo; he exclaimed  angrily, &ldquo;too bad, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dismounted at once, and  resigned his horse to Dad. But the Member for Up-North and Dinny Donoghue, who  misrepresented our district, wouldn&rsquo;t hear of such a sacrifice. They alighted  also, both vigorously claiming the right to &ldquo;pad the hoof.&rdquo; Finally, they  agreed to tramp and ride alternately, and Dad and the Minister rode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse him!&rdquo; Donoghue would hiss,  staring after the form of Stanley, every time his turn came to walk. &ldquo;May th&rsquo;  horse break his thick neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearing the end of the journey,  and about one mile from Buddville, Stanley happened, incidentally, to look  back. Perceiving Donoghue labouring laggardly along on foot, he stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bless</i> my soul!&rdquo; he said when Donoghue came up;. &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you  shout, man, for the horse? Well, well, well, you&rsquo;re a nice sort of fellow!  Here, man!&rdquo; And he jumped down and hoisted the tired politician into the saddle  before he conld protest.</p>
<p>Stanley then extended himself and  left the party behind. Approaching the house, he saw Mother and Sarah watching  intently from the verandah, and felt they were admiring his performance. He  determined to finish strong. The garden fence was before him. Exulting in the  consciousness of his own agility, he took off his hat, bounded lightly in the  air, ran at the palings, jumped, and fell heavily on the geraniums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Dad Takes to Politics</b></h2>
<p>Smith, the member for our  district, died one day, and we forgot all about him the next. Not that a  politician is ever remembered longer than that; but Smith had been a blind,  bigoted old Tory, and was better dead. Politicians mostly are better dead, as  far as other people are concerned.</p>
<p>One night, Gray and Wilkins and  Mulrooney and Fahey and Charley Thompson and Johnson and a lot of others came  to our place, and asked Dad to oppose Mulligan, the &ldquo;endorsed&rdquo; candidate for  Eton Vale. Dad was taken by surprise. He opened his eyes and stared, and he  chuckled too. But the deputation was in earnest, and waited for his reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the man we want, Rudd,&rdquo;  Gray said. &ldquo;You know the country and the wants of the district, and what is best  for the farmers, and you&rsquo;d be able to make yourself heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe and Dave, seated near the  fire, turned their heads and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only to <i>stand</i>.&rdquo; Mulrooney said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll get  the seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe and Dave chuckled  disparagingly, then rose and went on to the verandah. Dad glared after them  with ferocity in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would do for it,  Mr. Mulrooney,&rdquo; Mother said by way of apology for Dad. Dad didn&rsquo;t agree with  Mother. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;Why th&rsquo; devil wouldn&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;d tell some of them  fellows what I think of them an&rsquo; what they&rsquo;ve been doing for the country&mdash;th&rsquo;  robbers&mdash;believe me!&rdquo; And his eyes flashed real fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll stand then, Mr. Rudd?&rdquo;  Gray said again.</p>
<p>Dad stared first at one, then at  another, and seemed in doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yer dooty, Rudd,&rdquo; Thompson  drawled; and Thompson at heart didn&rsquo;t care two straws whether Dad consented to  stand or whether he went away and drowned himself</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want a man,&rdquo; Fahey added, &ldquo;who&rsquo;ll  go to Brisbane and put the sufferances of the farmers plainly an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;<i>well</i> before Parliament&mdash;a man who&rsquo;ll&mdash;who&rsquo;ll <i>talk</i> t&rsquo; thim, an&rsquo; talk straight-forredly  t&rsquo; thim, an&mdash;an&mdash;tell thim what&rsquo;s right an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; what ought t&rsquo; be done! An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s  no one can do it better&rsquo;n you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad stared at the floor in  silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yer dooty,&rdquo; Thompson drawled  again, filling his pipe.</p>
<p>Dave and Joe laughed aloud, and  left the verandah and went to the barn to husk corn.</p>
<p>At last Dad pulled himself  together. &ldquo;Then I <i>will!</i>&rdquo; he said; and  rising to his feet he struck the table hard with his fist and put the light  out. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my word!&rdquo; he shouted in the dark.</p>
<p>Mulrooney struck a match, and  Sarah relit the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I give me word,&rdquo; Dad  went on, &ldquo;I alwez <i>keep</i> it!&rdquo; And he  struck the table harder than before, and put the lamp out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness me!&rdquo; Mother moaned; &ldquo;what  is the man doing?&rdquo; But Mulrooney struck another match and handed it to Sarah.</p>
<p>Dad then went into details, and  the deputation expressed its delight with him, and went away.</p>
<p>Next morning at breakfast Joe  asked Dave whom he was going to vote for, and Dave spluttered into his cup and  splashed tea about the table. Sarah, at the bottom of the board, struggled to  suppress her mirth. Dad, at the head, cleared his throat and scowled. Joe  looked calmly at Dad and said: &ldquo;When are y&rsquo; going to address the &rsquo;lectors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave bent his head and leaned  heavily on his knife and fork, and spluttered more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad answered severely, &ldquo;my  committee will arrange all that, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave lifted his head and felt for  something to wipe the tears from his eyes with. Barty, seated opposite, pointed  with his fork to Dave and cried: &ldquo;L&mdash;l&mdash;<i>look</i> at &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of us broke into loud  hilarity&mdash;all of us except Dad. He dropped his knife and fork and shouted: &ldquo;<i>Look here&mdash;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dave and Joe rose together and  hastened to the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; devil take them!&rdquo; Dad  growled, taking up his knife and fork again and proceeding with his breakfast, &ldquo;and  their confounded impudence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To our astonishment, Dad kept  faith with the deputation and prepared to contest Eton Vale. He went with Gray  and Thompson and travelled round the country, and addressed the electors at the  Middle Arm, and Cherry Gully, and Bible Creek, and Tannymorel, and Hell-hole,  and any place where there was a school or a shed or anything he could stand up  in. At nearly every place Dad appeared he was received with joy and enthusiasm  and made much of.</p>
<p>Saddletop was the only place where  he met with opposition, and then only from old Carey. Carey was jealous of Dad&rsquo;s  prosperity and popularity, and jumped up at the meeting and accused him of all  kinds of villainy, and called him &ldquo;Judas!&rdquo; But when Dad came off the platform  and reached for Carey, Carey hurried out, and nothing more was heard from him  until heavy lumps of blue metal began to thump and rattle on the iron roof, and  punctuate Dad&rsquo;s oration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t he a&mdash; scoundrel?&rdquo; Dad  said to the audience, and they stood up and yelled. They enjoyed Dad. His style  suited them. He used plain language, and didn&rsquo;t quote statistics or poetry or  scripture. And they liked Dad because he wasn&rsquo;t a sham&mdash;because he didn&rsquo;t go to  their houses and ask after the health of absent members of the family whom he  had never seen, and wish to be remembered to them; because he didn&rsquo;t compliment  the wives upon having honest, hardworking, industrious husbands, when he didn&rsquo;t  know if they had or not&mdash;and because he didn&rsquo;t hug and cuddle every baby in the  electorate, and say they resembled their fathers or their mothers or someone.  People respected Dad, too, because he was plain and honest, and when polling day  came round they voted for him to a man, and with a big cheer put him in at the  head of the poll.</p>
<p>We could scarcely believe it when  the news came that Dad was in. Dave said: &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; Sarah danced about  and clapped her hands and spoke of going to Brisbane; and Mother sat down and  shed tears.</p>
<p>And when Gray drove Dad home in  the buggy we all gathered round and received him like a monarch. We had never  honoured our parent so much before. Mother threw her arms round Dad and hugged  him; Sarah took possession of his arm; Barty hung on fondly to the slack of his  pants; Joe carried his top-coat, and Dave walked in the rear grinning.</p>
<p>Dad stood it well. He showed  wonderful composure. You&rsquo;d think he had been a member of Parliament all his  days. When he had mounted the verandah he turned, and looking at us all, said: &ldquo;To-morrow  I&rsquo;ll have to go to Brisbane, an&rsquo; be away all the session, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll have the  place to look after y&rsquo;selves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a welcome piece of news.  It sent a thrill of delight right through us. To every one of us it was the  happiest feature of Dad&rsquo;s political triumph. We hoped the session might last  for the term of Dad&rsquo;s natural life.</p>
<p>Next day Joe drove Dad to the  railway station, and he caught the train for Brisbane.</p>
<p>At Toogoom Dad was joined by  another member of Parliament, a politician who conducted a newspaper and had  used its influence to belittle and vilify Dad because he was honest. He grabbed  Dad by the hand and said he was delighted to see him, and congratulated him on  his victory, and treated him just like a brother. Dad was astonished. Dad didn&rsquo;t  know much about politicians then.</p>
<p>Arrived at Brisbane, Dad set out  with his portmanteau for his old boarding-house on Wickham Terrace. He had  scarcely entered the establishment when the boarders were rushing wildly into  each other&rsquo;s rooms, calling out &ldquo;Esau is back!&rdquo; They all remembered Dad, and  seemed pleased to see him again.</p>
<p>Next morning, at breakfast, Dad  sat over a plate of sausage, and in a loud voice enquired the way to Parliament  House. Several of the boarders directed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to hear them speak,  Mr. Rudd?&rdquo; the landlady asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Dad answered, &ldquo;and to  speak myself, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all stared at Dad then, and  one who read the papers regularly, and had a memory for names, asked him if he  was related to the Rudd who had been returned for Eton Vale?</p>
<p>Dad leaned back as if he was in a  barber&rsquo;s chair, and laughed heartily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>&rsquo;im!</i>&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>me</i> that beat Mulligan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all stared again and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Really</i>, though, Mr. Rudd?&rdquo; the landlady asked meekly, and as if she  secretly doubted Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs,&rdquo; Dad went on, ignoring the  lady, &ldquo;I beat Mulligan easy enough. Be three &rsquo;und&rsquo;ed an&rsquo; ten, I think it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known you had a member of  Parliament here, Mrs. Brown,&rdquo; said a beery-looking boarder, the wag of the  house, rising and leaning on the back of his chair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have taken off my  boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a loud roar round the  table then, and every eye was fixed cheerfully on Dad. Dad glared at the wag.  The wag smiled placidly back at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;that would be  more than y&rsquo; do when y&rsquo; go to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They roared louder then, and the  wag changed colour and went away. Somebody reached over and said &ldquo;Good man!&rdquo; to  Dad, and hit him hard on the back, and made him spill all the tea out of the  saucer which he had just blown cool and was lifting to his mouth. Dad frowned.  Then another boarder repeated Dad&rsquo;s retort to the wag, and the room rang with  renewed hilarity. And the same boarder punched Dad on the back a second time, and  caused a sausage to escape from his fork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Damn you!</i>&rdquo; Dad shouted, turning fiercely on him. But the boarder  folded his serviette, and hurried from the table chuckling. So did the others.</p>
<p>Dad found his way to Parliament  House, and entered the building as if he was proprietor of it. He seemed to be  emulating in dignity and lordliness the member for Warwick.</p>
<p>Several messengers, and a clean,  well-groomed, well-fed policeman approached Dad. They appeared to suspect he  was a new hairy sort of Guy Fawkes, with evil designs on the costly and sacred  edifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s th&rsquo; place where they&rsquo;re  speakin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dad asked.</p>
<p>The Law pointed up a wide  staircase, and said: &ldquo;But y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t go there. Have you a ticket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along there then,&rdquo; the  policeman said, pointing through a doorway; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll get a ticket for the  gallery, and go up the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad poked his way through, and a  boy in brass buttons handed him a ticket in silence, and pointed up the stairs.</p>
<p>Dad blundered up like an elephant,  his footsteps and false steps echoing all over the building. He reached the top  breathless; and when his eyes rested on a group of ordinary-looking people  crouching in listening attitudes, he looked bewildered. A policeman with white  gloves on, and his hair oiled and parted in the centre, grimaced and motioned  to Dad to sit down.</p>
<p>A voice came from the depths of  the Chamber: &ldquo;I repeat, Sir, that the Government have made no efforts whatever  to encourage the right people to come and settle here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad looked down, and saw all the  eminent legislators of his country lolloping idly on the benches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a loud  voice, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those in the gallery turned their  heads and looked angrily at Dad. The policeman tip-toed up a few short steps  and whispered a brief warning into Dad&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; Dad said  in a voice that travelled round the building and reached the ear of Mr.  Speaker, who turned his eyes up to the gallery.</p>
<p>The policeman squeezed Dad&rsquo;s arm  viciously to silence him; but he might just as well have squeezed one of the  wooden forms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; Dad said  again in a louder key.</p>
<p>The policeman grimaced some more,  and removed Dad&rsquo;s hat from his head and tried to force him into a seat. Dad  recovered his hat with a violent wrench, and hit the policeman on the head with  it, and knocked the parting out of his hair and planted a lot of dust in it.  The gallery stood up to enjoy Dad. The policeman clenched his teeth, and  pounced fiercely on Dad. But Dad put both hands to him and shoved him right off  his feet, and he fell down the short steps with a thud against a little man  with a bald head, and crushed him under a form. The gallery forgot about the  debate, and in one voice cheered the new show. Dad expanded his chest and  extended his nostrils, and stood game and defiant-looking, waiting for the Law  to renew the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear the gallery!&rdquo; came from Mr.  Speaker.</p>
<p>Then there was commotion! In an  instant three policemen appeared in the gallery and seized Dad, and rolled down  the stairs with him. Dad yelled and fought with them like a wild beast; and the  Law had just sent for a cab to take Dad to gaol, when the member for Toogoom  appeared and recognised him. The Toogoom man explained matters, then took Dad  into the refreshment room and calmed him.</p>
<p>The member for Toogoom became a  sort of &ldquo;best man&rdquo; to Dad. He conducted him to the &ldquo;chair,&rdquo; and introduced him  to Mr. Speaker as the member for Eton Vale. The Speaker bowed profoundly to  Dad, and Dad asked him how he was getting on, then took a seat on the cross  benches and sank deep into the costly leather cushions, and cleared his throat  several times and groaned, and glared composedly round the gorgeous chamber and  up at the galleries. Those in the gallery stared down at Dad and grinned. And  the &ldquo;members&rdquo; conversed with each other about him, and the reporters made notes  of his arrival and his personal appearance, and the artists made sketches of  him which no one but themselves would ever recognise.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take Dad long to become  the most notorious member of the Assembly. He stood for virility and sincerity.  Whenever an idea struck him he expressed it in a loud voice, in his own  uncompromising vernacular. Nobody ever failed to comprehend Dad&rsquo;s language. He  usually said everything three times over, in case of doubt, and a fourth time  to make sure; but there never was any doubt. As for compromises, Dad scorned  them. He knew right from wrong, or thought he did; and he never waited to hear  what anybody else thought before saying what <i>he</i> thought. He wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;trimmer,&rdquo; and in Parliament he had no more  inclination to sit on a fence than he had at home on the farm.</p>
<p>Consequently people came  especially to see and hear Dad, and they never went away disappointed, Whatever  their expectations were, Dad generally surpassed expectation; and that merely  by virtue of being himself, a plain man with an unmistakeably plain manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Dad In Parliament</b></h2>
<p>Here they lolled&mdash;seventy-two  picked men, seventy-two paid representatives of public opinion, seventy-two  imposing-looking politicians. Some of them were lean and long and weary; some  big, bulky, and bloated; some dejected; some jolly; some poetic; some pious;  some had long hair; some had no hair; many of them wore spectacles; one wore an  eyeglass; and one, the prig of the galaxy, wore curls.</p>
<p>The Minister for Lands rose to  introduce &ldquo;A Land Settlement Bill,&rdquo; and made a long speech. He said no country  in the wide world was so liberal in the matter of land as this country, and  with eloquence and enthusiasm he proceeded to reveal a new scheme for settling  people on the land. There was never a Minister for Lands yet born who hadn&rsquo;t a new  scheme for settling people somewhere or other.</p>
<p>Dad screwed himself round, crossed  his legs, and fixed his eyes intently on that Minister. You&rsquo;d think he was  preparing to enjoy a sermon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first clause of the Bill,&rdquo;  the Minister went on, &ldquo;provision is made for monetary assistance, and the  principal aim of the measure is to help those who have a desire to live a country  life to settle on the land in communities&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just here an oldish member, named  O&rsquo;Riley, with a wild-looking head of flowing white hair, and a strong Irish  accent, said &ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat near Dad, and Dad glared  aggressively at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing new in the  village community system,&rdquo; the Minister resumed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s older than the Norman  Conquest.&rdquo; Then he talked glibly about &ldquo;grazing farms,&rdquo; and &ldquo;homesteads,&rdquo; and &ldquo;continuous  occupation by the groups,&rdquo; and &ldquo;undue restrictions,&rdquo; and &ldquo;articles of export,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;open markets,&rdquo; and many other ancient and miserable platitudes.</p>
<p>Dad edged along the seat an inch  or two so as not to miss any of him, and unconsciously leaned on the Hibernian&rsquo;s  tall black hat. O&rsquo;Reilly poked Dad in the ribs with a silver-headed  walking-stick, which he was leaning on, and nodded a hint to dissociate himself  from the beaver. Dad scowled disdainfully, but didn&rsquo;t remove himself. O&rsquo;Riley  poked him in the ribs again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; Dad said, &ldquo;What do you <i>want?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have y&rsquo; not iny manners? Do not  ye see you&rsquo;re crushing me hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Speaker reproved O&rsquo;Riley. &ldquo;Order!&rdquo;  he said, sententiously; &ldquo;Order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad glared angrily at O&rsquo;Riley,  then shoved the hat away, and again gave all his attention to the Minister.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Riley continued to snarl  audibly, and turned the whites of his eyes menacingly at Dad, and attracted the  attention of members sitting behind. They laughed, and were in turn called to  order by the Speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These co-operators, therefore,&rdquo;  the Minister said, &ldquo;will have to settle their disputes among themselves, except  in matters of a criminal nature, and if they resort to any contentious  proceedings&mdash;that is to say, if they go to law with one another&mdash; they will cease  to be members of the society. This is a bold experiment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; a <i>fool</i> of a one!&rdquo; Dad shouted in a voice that drowned the Minister&rsquo;s;  and rising to his feet, he held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo; the Speaker cried,  eyeing Dad like an adder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here&mdash;!&rdquo; Dad shouted,  pointing his finger at the Minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honourable member for Eton  Yale must desist interrupting the&mdash;&rdquo; The rest of the Speaker&rsquo;s rebuke was lost.</p>
<p>The Chamber suddenly became  boisterous. &ldquo;Sit down! Sit down!&rdquo; came from every corner. Then a member seated  behind Dad reached forward and pulled him down on the seat by the coat-tail.</p>
<p>Dad turned angrily on O&rsquo;Riley and  shook his fist at him, and in a loud voice warned him to be careful. O&rsquo;Riley  gesticulated and showed his teeth to Dad and hissed, and among other things  said that he &ldquo;had been a mimber of the House for twenty-five years an&rsquo; more.&rdquo;  Dad grunted contemptuously, and said &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t care if he had been a member  for fifty-five year!&rdquo; O&rsquo;Riley turned the whites of his eyes at Dad again, then  ignored him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It provides that in cases of  destitution,&rdquo; continued the Minister, &ldquo;certain allowances may be made to the  wives and families of the men for a limited period at places away from the  settlement. It would be impossible to take women and children to a settlement  in its rough condition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Whaht?</i>&rdquo; Dad yelled, jumping up again. &ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil sort o&rsquo;  people do you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo; came sharp and  angrily from the Speaker. &ldquo;The honourable member must retract those words at  once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; from  those on the Ministerial side, mingled with loud cries of &ldquo;Withdraw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come here,&rdquo; Dad shouted,  waving his hands about, &ldquo;to see that the honest an&rsquo; right an&rsquo; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cries of &ldquo;Chair! Chair!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sit  down!&rdquo; accompanied by loud laughter from the Labour Party, overflowed the  Chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask the honourable member  for Eton Vale, once and for all,&rdquo; the Speaker said, angrily, &ldquo;to resume his  seat.&rdquo; And he seemed to mean what he said.</p>
<p>Dad lifted his voice again, but &ldquo;Chair!  Chair!&rdquo; and more Labour laughter smothered him. It looked as if something  serious must happen, but the member for Toogoom hurried across the floor and  talked persuasively into Dad&rsquo;s ear, and Dad gave way reluctantly, and sat  heavily down on O&rsquo;Riley&rsquo;s long hat and made it flat.</p>
<p>Then there was disorder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why th&rsquo; devil didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; look  after it, then?&rdquo; Dad snorted at O&rsquo;Riley, rising and releasing the battered  beaver; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t eyes behind me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an ignorant elephant, that&rsquo;s  what you are!&rdquo; O&rsquo;Riley said, lifting his voice and the beaver. Dad turned and  fell on O&rsquo;Riley, and took him by the collar and squeezed him hard into the  cushion.</p>
<p>There was real commotion and  genuine excitement then!</p>
<p>All the members stood up. Some  called &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; others &ldquo;Disgraceful!&rdquo; People in the galleries leaned over and  grinned, and burst buttons off their garments in unloosing their joy.</p>
<p>Messengers and miscellaneous  members rushed eagerly through the lobbies and into the &ldquo;refreshment room,&rdquo;  urging absent ones to hurry and witness the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lesh them fi&rsquo; it out!&rdquo; murmured  the honourable member for Fillemupagen, hanging on fondly to the edge of the  bar by the dimple in his chin.</p>
<p>The Speaker grew pale, and  exhausted himself appealing for &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; He might just as well have called &ldquo;Butcher!&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Baker!&rdquo; or anything, for Dad was deaf to it all.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Riley twisted his legs round Dad&rsquo;s  neck, and yelled in a shrill, hideous key, and hit blindly at Dad&rsquo;s ear with  his fist. Dad straightened up and swung round with him, but couldn&rsquo;t shake him  off. A small dog with no tail which had been lying asleep in a corner of the &ldquo;Under-Secretary&rsquo;s&rdquo;  gallery, woke up suddenly, and seeing O&rsquo;Riley being swung round, thought he was  a bicycle, and rushed in and yelped vigorously at Dad.</p>
<p>The Labour Party broke into fresh  bursts of hilarity, and a messenger in uniform hastened to eject the dog. The  animal dodged through his legs and barked at him. The occupants of the &ldquo;Strangers&rsquo;&rdquo;  gallery lost control of their emotions and hung over the railings and shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear the Galleries!&rdquo; the Speaker  gasped, and created more commotion and disorder. At last several members seized  Dad and separated him from O&rsquo;Riley, and asked him to have some sense and not to  be a fool. O&rsquo;Riley, bereft of his collar and tie, and with his white hair  dishevelled, stood panting and gasping for a moment; then suddenly, and with  the agility of a circus man, he divested himself of his coat, which he tossed  fiercely to the rear. It spread itself out on to the table, and upset a  water-bottle on the Statutes. Then O&rsquo;Riley ripped his vest off with one pull  and flung it away too. It fluttered through the Chamber and settled calmly on  the Speaker. And whilst &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; echoed all round, he yelled a  profane sort of prelude, then struck a pugilistic attitude and sparred wildly  round Dad and those who were restraining him, and bumped the table about.</p>
<p>The member for Fillemupagen rolled  into the Chamber, and hiccoughed above the din, &ldquo;Lesh &rsquo;im have&rsquo;sh it, Riley&mdash;he&rsquo;sh  &rsquo;gainst Fe&rsquo;ration!&rdquo; More loud laughter from the Labour Party, and pathetic  cries of &ldquo;Disgraceful!&rdquo; from the Conservatives.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Chesterfield&rdquo; of the  Assembly, submerged in a high collar, rose and appealed for peace. &ldquo;I nevah in  all mai laife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;witnessed anything so beastly bleggahdly.&rdquo; Then he  went outside the bar in disgust and murmured &ldquo;Vulgah bleggahds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally two or three members  secured O&rsquo;Riley, and conducted him to an ante-room, where they calmed and  clothed him. Dad sat down and glared round like an injured lion. Then the  Premier, pale and trembling with indignation, rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;It is  with feelings of pain&mdash;with feelings of <i>shame</i>,  Sir (Hear, hear!) that I rise to refer to the disgraceful scene&mdash;the degrading  exhibition of ruffianism which this honourable House has just witnessed.&rdquo; (The  member for Bordertown with the clean shave shifted his chew from the hollow of  one cheek to the other, and said &ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; then leisurely went on chewing  some more.) &ldquo;During the whole of the twenty years that I have had the honour to  hold a seat in this Chamber, Sir, I have never known an occasion when the  honour and reputation of this House has been so insulted, so er&mdash;er&mdash; dragged to  the level, I might say, of the common public-house backyard brawl, Sir.&rdquo; (Loud  applause and shouts of approval from the Conservatives, intermingled with &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo;  and shouts of &ldquo;What about the Jerkins incident!&rdquo; from the Labour supporters,  and hiccoughs and &ldquo;Queshun!&rdquo; from the member for Fillemupagen, and &ldquo;Order!&rdquo;  from the Speaker.) &ldquo;The hon. member for Churchland&rdquo; (meaning O&rsquo;Riley) &ldquo;is an  old member of this House, Sir, and I&rsquo;m amazed, Mr. Speaker, amazed, I say, and  grieved, that he should so far forget himself as to be guilty of such  conduct&mdash;conduct only becoming er&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; from the member for Bourke,  and laughter from the Labour Party) &ldquo;<i>a  lunatic</i>, Sir!&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Riley, who had re-entered the Chamber, here jumped to his  feet and vociferated wildly, and was promptly pulled by two other members on to  the cushion again, where he kicked and scratched and yelled &ldquo;I am not a  lunatic!&rdquo;) &ldquo;The honourable member for Eton Vale,&rdquo; turning and glancing in the  direction of Dad, &ldquo;is the youngest member of this House, and it may be well he  should understand that if he comes here with no respect for himself he might at  least show some reverence and regard for the honourable position he happens to  hold, and for the dignity and reputation of this Assembly.&rdquo; (Wild applause from  the Ministerialists, during which Dad groaned contentedly, and stared about the  Chamber and up at the crowded galleries.) &ldquo;And&rdquo;&mdash;the Premier concluded severely&mdash;  &ldquo;I ask you to call upon the honourable member for Churchland and the honourable  member for Eton Vale to apologise to this House, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Chamber rang with cheers  and triumphant cries of &ldquo;Apologise!&rdquo; from the Government benches.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Chesterfield&rdquo; of the  Assembly, in his lofty, lordly fashion, rose to gratuitously endorse the  remarks of the Premier, and more confusion followed. The Independents and  Labour members rose <i>en masse</i>, and  bombarded him with cries of &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; &ldquo;Chair!&rdquo; &ldquo;The member for Churchland!&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Let them apologise!&rdquo; Then &ldquo;Chesterfield&rdquo; turned ferociously upon them, and  lifting his voice above theirs shouted back:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will have the mannahs to  permit mai to be heard, I only wish to sai that you ah the maost vulgah cwowd  of hoodlums that evah disgwaced a Legislative Assembly!&rdquo; And he sat down  suddenly, and mopped his flushed brow with a large silk handkerchief and  muttered, &ldquo;Vulgah cads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rise to a point of order, Mr.  Speaker!&rdquo; yelled a broad-shouldered member, with a tremendous voice, across the  table. Is the member for Bunya in order, Sir, in describing members on this  side the House as a horde of hoodlums, disgracing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker!&rdquo; the Premier hotly  interrupted, landing on his feet in a bound&mdash; &ldquo;the member for Churchland and the  member for Eton Vale should be asked to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked for your decision,  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order,&rdquo; the broad-backed member yelled back. (Cheers  and &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; from the Labour Party).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chair! Chair!&rdquo; from different  parts of the Assembly. Then the Speaker, red in the face and angry-looking,  pointed his sharp-edged features at the broad-backed Labour man, who was  standing erect and wagging his head, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the honourable member for the  Bunya made use of the words complained of by the honourable member for St.  George, such expressions are certainly unparliamentary, and must be with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Premier jumped to his feet  again and interrupted excitedly&mdash; &ldquo;I regret to have to move, Sir, that your  ruling be disagreed with.&rdquo; (Great disorder). &ldquo;According to May&mdash;&rdquo; (More disorder  and loud cries of &ldquo;Chair!&rdquo; &ldquo;Respect the Chair!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; during which Dad  rose and strolled out of the Chamber, as did the member for Toogoom and O&rsquo;Riley.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is clearly laid down in May,  Mr. Speaker, Clause 999 that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chair! Chair! Chair!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must draw the attention of the  Honourable the Leader of the Government,&rdquo; the Speaker said, &ldquo;to the fact that  the question before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was suddenly interrupted from  an unexpected quarter. On his left at the bar of the Chamber fresh disorder  broke out.</p>
<p>The prig of the House rushed into  the Chamber in fear and trembling, with his curls standing straight up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Let go ov me! Let go ov me! Let go ov me!</i>&rdquo; rang out in a wild  shrill key, and Dad and O&rsquo;Riley, locked in each other&rsquo;s embrace, rocked and  swayed about in the lobby, then with a heavy thud fell on the carpet, their  heads just inside the Chamber.</p>
<p>Wild confusion! Those who were not  in a position to see what was going on stood on the seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgwaceful!&rdquo; the Chesterfield of  the Assembly moaned. &ldquo;A positive outwage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;sh on top thish &rsquo;ime?&rdquo;  murmured the member for Fillemupagen, with his chin resting calmly on his  chest.</p>
<p>A spectator in the gallery&mdash;one of  the unwashed who spent much valueless time following the debates&mdash;craned to get  a view of the struggle, and overbalanced himself and fell in. But he clung with  both hands to the balustrading, and kicked his legs about like a frog in water  just above the heads of a bunch of Government supporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>The bunch of Government supporters  suddenly looked up, then took alarm and divided and rushed across the floor.</p>
<p>The Speaker closed his eyes and  moaned.</p>
<p>The Chamber rang with a fresh  burst of Labour laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my G&mdash;! help!&rdquo; groaned the  dangling form. All eyes were turned on it. But the long arms of the Law reached  down from the gallery and hauled the intruder back. Then they shook him and  kicked him down the stairs.</p>
<p>At the same moment Dad and O&rsquo;Riley  suddenly disappeared from the floor. The member for Toogoom and some more  dragged them away by the heels and saved the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shocking!&rdquo; &ldquo;Shocking!&rdquo; came from  Ministers, while bursts of smothered merriment continued to escape from the  ranks of Labour, and for some moments the House didn&rsquo;t know where it was. Then  the Speaker, perspiring and harassed-looking, turned his face to the clock and  said he would &ldquo;resume the Chair at seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newspapers made a great fuss  about the incident, and when we read them at Ruddville, we felt that all those  years we had never known what our father was capable of.</p>
<p>On Sandy&rsquo;s Selection Kate almost  prayed with pride. She and Sandy read the account in The Queenslander to little  Jimmy, and exhorted him solemnly to grow up and be a great man like  grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if you will, Mother,&rdquo; said  Jimmy.</p>
<p>Kate grinned at Sandy, and said it  was rather late in the day for her to aim at greatness, but she would do her  best. And sure enough she did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Ripper Sewing-Machine</b></h2>
<p>Summer time. Sandy, worn,  weary-looking, his face smudged with soil and perspiration, came inside and  threw himself down on the sofa. He growled and grumbled about the scuffler, and  abused the old horse he&rsquo;d left yoked to it in the paddock. He reckoned the  brute was doing more harm than good to the corn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d come out and give you a  hand,&rdquo; Kate said sympathisingly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve all this sewing to do, and fix up.&rdquo;  And she tossed a pile of calico and flannel and stuff about.</p>
<p>Then she asked Jimmy if he&rsquo;d seen  the thimble, and what he did with the cotton? And Jimmy, who was seated at her  feet playing with the waste pieces, produced the missing articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a couple of flannels  to run up for yourself, and a couple of little suits for Jimmy, besides a lot  of patching and mending, and&mdash;these here.&rdquo; And she indicated a heap of miniature  garments. Whom <i>they</i> were for wasn&rsquo;t quite clear, but Sandy seemed to  understand. &ldquo;Perhaps Mary could give you a hand,&rdquo; Kate went on, &ldquo;she isn&rsquo;t any  use to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, who just then was out  gathering an armful of wood, was a useless sort of a girl sent by her mother to  Kate to be taught &ldquo;to sew and to be useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sandy said; &ldquo;Saunders is  there if I want anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saunders was putting in a day&rsquo;s  ploughing for Sandy, and was working the other horse.</p>
<p>Kate threaded the needle, and  stitched on in silence. Sandy stretched himself full length, and reflected.</p>
<p>After a while: &ldquo;What about seeing  Mrs. Holstein?&rdquo; Kate said.</p>
<p>Sandy said he&rsquo;d go across in the  evening. Then he left the sofa, took a pint, reached himself a drink from the  bottom of the cask, and returned to the scuffler, and yelled at the horse  again. The horse rocked and rolled and rushed out of his course, and broke down  more corn.</p>
<p>An hour after. The rooster came to  the door and crowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stranger coming,&rdquo; Kate said,  gnawing the end of the thread. Mary, like the idiot she was, grunted, and held  up one of the miniature garments to admire. Kate snatched it from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be flying them about!&rdquo; she  said, and buried it in the pile.</p>
<p>The dog barked. &ldquo;There is someone,&rdquo;  Kate said, and Mary bounced up and gaped out the front door, then turned and  ran to the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man,&rdquo; she grunted, &ldquo;at the  rails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake, then,&rdquo; Kate  snapped, rising and straightening things up, &ldquo;keep out of sight&mdash;look at the cut  of you! . . . Where did you put my skirt? Quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary ran in and out of two rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at you without a boot to  your foot! . . . Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary rushed off, and poked her  head out the back door again. &ldquo;Lockin&rsquo; th&rsquo; wheels of his cart, and puttin&rsquo; nose-bags  on his horses,&rdquo; she reported.</p>
<p>The stranger strode round to the  front, and Kate stepped out to meet him. &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; he said, lifting his  hat.</p>
<p>Kate said &ldquo;Good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Smith&mdash;Beresford  Charles Smith. I&rsquo;m travelling this district as the representative of the Ripper  sewing-machine. Can I do some business with you, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, and his eyes roamed in  through the open door and lit on Kate&rsquo;s heap of needlework.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have no sewing-machine,&rdquo;  he went on, &ldquo;though you have plenty sewing to do. The very woman that should  have one. Just excuse me for half-a-minute,&rdquo; and he turned to his cart, and  lifted down a sewing-machine.</p>
<p>He struggled with it to the  verandah, and dumped it down enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a cornsheller,&rdquo; Mary  whispered.</p>
<p>The man stood over it, and took a  rag from his pocket and dusted it here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price of it is &pound;14,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;payable in monthly instalments of half-a-guinea. It&rsquo;s the easiest thing in  life to work one of these. All you have to do,&rdquo; (taking a scrap of cloth from  his pocket) &ldquo;is to place your material under the needle so, then&rdquo; (dragging a  box towards him, and sitting tenderly on it) &ldquo;put your foot square on the  treadle, touch the wheel and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The machine rattled off.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page213.jpg" alt="ripper" width="650" height="494"></p>
<p>Kate stared; Mary guffawed; and  Jimmy came forward with a stick in his hand, and was motioned back by the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This machine isn&rsquo;t like other  machines, Missis,&rdquo; the man explained, &ldquo;it will stitch as many doubles as you  like. It will even sew leather, and you can&rsquo;t break it. Now sit here, and try  it yourself, and see how simple it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate glanced down at the boots she  had on, and turned red. The one on her right foot was an old one of Sandy&rsquo;s,  the one on her left foot was a canvas shoe that Jimmy had found in the dust of  a drover&rsquo;s camp one Sunday. But the man didn&rsquo;t press her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; he went on, dipping his  hand into a box of implements, &ldquo;are the different arrangements for fancy work. .  . That&rsquo;s a quilter. This is a friller. Here&rsquo;s a tucker.&rdquo; And he explained their  uses. &ldquo;You can do any work,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;with these machines&mdash;sew on buttons,  or put a patch on your good man&rsquo;s trousers.&rdquo; Kate smiled, and Mary guffawed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rdquo; (looking round) &ldquo;if I had a  piece of waste fabric I would show you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate hurried into the bedroom to  fossick out something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are.&rdquo; (He pounced on the  pile of sewing and lifted the topmost article.) &ldquo;This will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes rested on the small  sleeves to the thing, and he tossed it back, and grinned at Mary. Kate returned  with a waste piece of moleskin, and the man placed it on the machine and  stitched it into all shapes. Then he mentioned the terms again, and produced  some papers and a pen, and asked Kate her full name.</p>
<p>Kate thought he had better consult  Sandy about the matter, and told him where Sandy could be found. The man went  down the paddock and saw Saunders scratching about with one horse and a plough.  Saunders waved him off. He turned away and saw Sandy emerging from the corn behind  the scuffler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, sir,&rdquo; he called  to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come round &rsquo;ere, you clumsy  brute, y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sandy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Mr. Taylor?&rdquo; the man asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> stumblin&rsquo; cow!&rdquo; Sandy  shouted. &ldquo;Keep y&rsquo;r head out of it; eatin&rsquo; is all y&rsquo;r good for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put a nose-bag on him, sir,&rdquo; the  man suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n &rsquo;im,&rdquo; Sandy shouted, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s  gettin&rsquo; too much now, without puttin&rsquo; any nose-bag on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy turned the horse round, and  was &ldquo;flicking&rdquo; him up again, when the man lifted his voice. &ldquo;One moment, sir,&rdquo;  he called, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m selling your good lady a machine, and if you don&rsquo;t mind  stepping up, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy stopped the horse. &ldquo;What  sort of a machine?&rdquo; he asked sulkily.</p>
<p>The machine man explained. Then,  without giving time to reply, he praised the corn (which was drooping as fast  as it could for want of rain), and said the selection altogether was a grand  sight&mdash;a perfect panorama&mdash;as you approached it from the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Sandy went with him to the house  to see the Ripper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid machine,&rdquo; Kate  said approvingly to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a house in any of the  towns,&rdquo; the man remarked, placing his hands on his wares, &ldquo;without a machine of  this kind. Every year, I suppose, I dispose of thousands of them.&rdquo; (He felt  himself all over.) &ldquo;If I had my book here I could tell you the exact number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he showed Sandy how it would  sew leather. &ldquo;What about hide?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rum arrangement, right  enough,&rdquo; Sandy murmured in admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten shillings a month,&rdquo; the man  said, producing the pen and papers again. &ldquo;In a couple of years the whole thing  will be paid off, and you won&rsquo;t have felt the cost of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s eyes danced, and he looked  at Kate</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good machine,&rdquo; Kate  mumbled, looking hard at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten shillings a month,&rdquo; Sandy  murmured, stroking his beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; the man  said, looking at Sandy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sell you the machine straight out for &pound;2; but you  must keep it to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my word,&rdquo; Sandy said. Then to  Kate: &ldquo;We got &pound;2?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just have it,&rdquo; Kate said,  producing the purse.</p>
<p>The man took the money, and gave  Sandy a receipt. Then went away, and left the horse and cart in the yard. Sandy  couldn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Sandy wasn&rsquo;t in a hurry to return  to the scuffling; he remained with Kate, and showed her how to put the Ripper out  of gear and to put it in gear, and when Kate had tired of experimenting he sat  down and worked it himself.</p>
<p>Sandy got on well with the  machine. He tried it on a piece of moleskin. Then he placed a scrap of leather under  the needle, and put all the weight of his feet on the treadle. There was a  crack! The needle flew into pieces, and the works inside the machine rattled  and buzzed like the spring of a roller-blind running down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; Kate said,  apprehensively.</p>
<p>Sandy stared at the Ripper for a  while; then discarded the leather, and inserting a fresh needle tried it on the  moleskin again. But the Ripper refused to work any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve broke it!&rdquo; Kate groaned,  sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must be a useless thing,&rdquo;  Sandy muttered, &ldquo;if it can&rsquo;t stand any more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went out and brought  Saunders in. Saunders laughed when he saw the Ripper, and asked Sandy what he  wanted buying a thing like that for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had it bought when I come in,&rdquo;  Sandy mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Kate snapped, &ldquo;you  bought it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my old woman bought me a thing  like that,&rdquo; Saunders said, philosophically, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d set fire to her.&rdquo; And he bent  over and proceeded to overhaul the Ripper like one who understood the mechanism  of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a screw-wrench?&rdquo; he said to  Sandy. Sandy produced one, and Saunders applied it to various parts of the  machine without success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only get a look at the  inside of her,&rdquo; he muttered, kneeling and scrutinising the Ripper closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off the wheel, and you might  get at it,&rdquo; Sandy suggested.</p>
<p>Saunders went to work on the  wheel. He grunted and screwed hard at it and swore, then he tapped it with the  screw-wrench, and it fell on the floor in several pieces. Kate&rsquo;s breath went  clean away.</p>
<p>Saunders threw the implement down  in disgust, and stared at the Ripper. &ldquo;Before I&rsquo;d buy a thing like that,&rdquo; he  said, shaking his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d cut me throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they went back to the plough.</p>
<p>Three days after, two policemen  and another man called at Sandy&rsquo;s place and claimed the horse and cart&mdash;also the  Ripper. They said they were stolen property, and asked for a description of the  man who left them.</p>
<p>Sandy didn&rsquo;t try to prevent them  taking the lot away.</p>

  Kate&rsquo;s Babies</b></h2>
<p>Sandy had brought Mrs. Holstein  and her traps in the dray, and was sitting on his haunches with his back  against the barn and an anxious look on his face, just as he had sat when Jimmy  was born.</p>
<p>An hour passed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holstein came to the back  door. &ldquo;Anoder poy!&rdquo; she called out.</p>
<p>Sandy straightened himself up and  grinned. Mrs. Holstein withdrew.</p>
<p>Sandy, stepping out briskly, paced  about between the barn and the house, whistling some sort of a tune.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holstein came to the back  door again. &ldquo;Anoder von!&rdquo; she shouted, grinning broadly&mdash; &ldquo;a gairl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy stopped whistling, and his  eyes and mouth opened wide. &ldquo;Two?&rdquo; he said, looking surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dweens!</i>&rdquo; And Mrs. Holstein laughed and disappeared again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; Sandy  murmured, and walked up and down some more.</p>
<p>After a while Mrs. Holstein came  to the door again, and burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theresh <i>d-d-dree!</i>&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;von more vos a poy!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My G&mdash;!&rdquo; Sandy said, &ldquo;I must stop  this,&rdquo; and he advanced hurriedly to the door. But Mrs. Holstein threw up her  hands and wouldn&rsquo;t let him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should feel sholly aboud dem  all. Two fine leetle poys, so like each oder as vos two pins. Und de leetle  girl vos so plump&mdash;so fat as a leetle pig.&rdquo; And she laughed at Sandy and hurried  inside again.</p>
<p>Then a chorus of strange voices  like the bleating of lambs fell on Sandy&rsquo;s ear, and he turned away, and running  his thick fingers through his hair shoved his hat off. Then he stood and  meditated.</p>
<p>He was meditating hard, when once  more the form of Mrs. Holstein appeared. It was too much for Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo; he shouted, and ran blindly in the direction of the barn.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page221.jpg" alt="four" width="650" height="500"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere vos not some more, you silly  shap!&rdquo; Mrs. Holstein called after him. But Sandy paid no attention to her; he  was heading for the haystack&mdash;whatever consolation he hoped to find there!&mdash;when  Uncle, who had been absent several months from the selection, rode cheerfully  into the yard with a swag rolled before him on the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tol dot foolish man dere vos <i>not</i> some more,&rdquo; Mrs. Holstein said,  appealing to Uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not some more <i>what?</i>&rdquo; Uncle asked, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not some more shilders. . . . I  tell him der missus she haf dreeplets, and he tink dere vos some more yet, und  rund avay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Triplets!</i>&rdquo; Uncle squealed. &ldquo;<i>Triplets!</i> Moses!&rdquo; and he tugged his old horse round and went away again. The selection  was no place for Uncle any more.</p>
<p>Sandy wandered up the paddock, and  walked aimlessly about among the trees, thinking and considering till he grew  cool. Then he decided to face the trouble like a man and with a light heart. He  returned to the house again, and grinning feebly went inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere vos only <i>dree</i>, you see,&rdquo; Mrs. Holstein giggled,  and Sandy stood and stared at the triplets. Fine-looking youngsters they were,  too; just like Sandy. After a while he began to look upon them with some pride  and admiration.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holstein shrieked at Sandy,  and said he ought to &ldquo;dink proud of himself,&rdquo; and added that her son Wilhelm  had been &ldquo;merriet fife year und hef only one just yet.&rdquo; Then she hit Sandy hard  on the back with her heavy dumpy hand and went out.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s admiration for his  offspring rapidly increased, and he hung over them and handled and fondled them  till Mrs. Holstein returned, and hinted it was time he left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You vill hef plenty times for dem  drekleys,&rdquo; she said, and laughed at Sandy again.</p>
<p>When word reached Ruddville that  Kate had triplets, Mother and Sarah became excited. You&rsquo;d think they were going  to a wedding or had come into a large fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>will</i> be proud!&rdquo; Sarah kept saying, and &ldquo;I <i>would</i> like to see them!&rdquo; and Mother put on her hat and ran down the  paddock to break the news to Dad, who had just reached home for the holidays,  after making the biggest Parliamentary reputation known for twenty-five years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I&rsquo;d expect!&rdquo; Dad  grunted; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got a lot o&rsquo; sense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be proud to be their  grandfather,&rdquo; Mother said smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gran&rsquo;father!</i>&rdquo; Dad snorted; &ldquo;what th&rsquo; devil do they want with <i>three!</i> Couldn&rsquo;t <i>one</i> be enough! Three foals or three calves would pay them better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dad was a mercenary old man. But,  nevertheless, he put the horse in the buggy next day and drove Mother and Sarah  over to see the triplets. Mother said she was sure Kate wouldn&rsquo;t have enough  little clothes for them all, and raked from the big family box a bundle of  garments she had harboured there for years&mdash;things she had used on Dan and Dave  when they were babies, and took them with her to give to Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo; y think o&rsquo; them?&rdquo; Sandy  asked, when Dad had looked at the triplets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dad said, clearing his  throat, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s better than <i>losin&rsquo;</i> one.&rdquo; And he sat and stared all round the room, examining the walls and the  naked rafters.</p>
<p>Sandy brought out the cup and a  bottle he&rsquo;d brought from the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; Dad said.</p>
<p>Sandy gave him a lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When were they born?&rdquo; Dad asked,  brightening up.</p>
<p>Sandy told him. Then Dad went and  had another look at the triplets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little girl is very like you,  Father,&rdquo; Kate said, with pride and admiration in her eyes.</p>
<p>Dad seemed to think she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show us a hold o&rsquo; some o&rsquo; them,&rdquo;  he said, and lifted one and walked about with it in his arms. Dad walked about  with one or the other for an hour or more, and when he was going away he left  three sovereigns&mdash;one for each of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Father&rsquo;s very proud of  them,&rdquo; said Kate, when the buggy had gone, and Sandy grinned and hung over the  triplets and suggested calling one of them after Dad.</p>
<p>It was no time before the whole  country-side had heard of Kate&rsquo;s triplets, and there was scarcely a man, woman,  or child that didn&rsquo;t come to see them. Even old Riley came.</p>
<p>Riley was fond of children, and  when he saw the three mites huddled together he shook his head and said; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis  wonderful! I often heerd o&rsquo; it; but I never sin it till neow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Sandy produced the bottle,  and poured some of the contents into a cup for Riley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Riley said, lifting the  cup to his head, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s good luck t&rsquo; ye; an&rsquo; I hope y&rsquo;ll allus be as fortinit!&rdquo;  And he tossed off the liquor without water and without a tear. Mrs. Holstein,  standing by with fun in her eye, shrieked cheerfully, and hit Sandy on the back  again. Sandy grinned and rolled the bottle up again in some rag, and put it  carefully away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dink can you menitch to go along  yourself some now?&rdquo; Mrs. Holstein said to Kate one morning. &ldquo;Dey vos vait for  me at der drashing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate felt sure she could manage  first-rate; and the nurse gathered up her traps, kissed the triplets several  times, hugged Kate too, then laughed at Sandy and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I von&rsquo;t come here some more  anoder time, Meeser Daylor, if you hef such a big shob fo&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she beckoned Sandy out of  Kate&rsquo;s hearing, and handed him a scrap of paper, and laughed again. &ldquo;Mine  leetle bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nine pounds!</i>&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed. &ldquo;<i>Nine  pounds!</i> . . . I thought you always charged <i>three!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For von, yah,&rdquo; Mrs. Holstein  explained. But you vos difference from oder beople . . . you vos haf dree,&rdquo; And  the German nurse screamed with delight at Sandy.</p>
<p>Sandy, concerned and  agitated-looking, said he would &ldquo;see the missus about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It vill be some lessons to you,&rdquo;  Mrs. Holstein squealed further as Sandy turned sadly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to pay it, I suppose,&rdquo;  Kate said in answer to Sandy; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re <i>worth</i> it, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; and she smiled and planted kisses on the cheeks of the  numerous offspring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means one of the cows &rsquo;ll have  to go,&rdquo; Sandy murmured, and went out to tell the nurse it &ldquo;would be orright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nene poun&rsquo;?&rdquo; and the tears ran  out of Mrs. Holstein&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You vos so foolidge, Meeser Daylor, I vos make  fun mid you.&rdquo; And she ran in and explained her joke to Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;s that it!&rdquo; Sandy drawled,  and brightened up. Then he grinned and went out and stood by the dray. Mrs.  Holstein climbed into it and they drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You send fo&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she called out  to Kate, &ldquo;if somedings go wrong mid the shilders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate said she would, and waved her  hand from the door.</p>
<p>A week had scarcely passed when  something went wrong. One of the triplets (the girl) screamed painfully the  whole of one night, and began again after breakfast. Kate was in distress. Once  or twice the infant&rsquo;s breath seemed to leave it altogether, and Kate told Sandy  to go at once for Mrs. Holstein. Sandy, more concerned even than Kate, rushed  away to catch a horse. But not a beast could he lay hands on. They seemed to  know he was in a hurry, and wouldn&rsquo;t stand or be driven to the yard. The old  black mare, that Kate could catch in any paddock at any hour of the day or  night, allowed him to approach within a foot or two of her, then changed her  mind and galloped after the others. Sandy cursed them bitterly, and ran back to  the house with an idea in his head.</p>
<p>The triplets were all screaming  when he entered the door, and Jimmy was bellowing violently too, because the &ldquo;puppy  dorg&rdquo; bit him. Kate was nearly out of her mind, and between her tears was  crooning &ldquo;<i>There</i> now!&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>There</i> now!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose any time!&rdquo; she  moaned, when she saw Sandy, and continued&mdash; &ldquo;<i>There</i>,  then! <i>There</i>, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page228.jpg" alt="trouble" width="650" height="488"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t catch any o&rsquo; them,&rdquo; Sandy  groaned; &ldquo;where&rsquo;s some o&rsquo; your old skirts?&rdquo; And he darted into the bedroom. He  came out again in a skirt of Kate&rsquo;s which reached to his knees and was open  down the front. Then he snatched up her hat and hurried to the paddock with the  bridle on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There then! . . . There then! . .  . There then!&rdquo; Kate continued to moan, pressing her cheek close to the face of  the mite that was most in trouble</p>
<p>Jimmy stopped bellowing to stare  at his father, then laughed.</p>
<p>He ran to the verandah and watched  him till he was out of sight, and laughed again.</p>
<p>When the horses saw Sandy  approaching they lifted their heads and stared. Then they lifted their tails  and trotted round him and stood. Sandy called kindly to the black mare in the  voice of Kate, and the lot snorted and turned and raced recklessly through the  timber, and fell over the fence and got lost.</p>
<p>Sandy didn&rsquo;t return to the house;  he stepped out of his disguise and started at a trot for Holstein&rsquo;s, three  miles away.</p>
<p>The thresher was humming and  buzzing, and a dozen men or more were busily lifting bags, tossing hay and  heaving sheaves about, when Sandy entered the yard. A number of dogs rushed out  from the shade of the stacks and barked. A man on a stack looked down, and,  recognising Sandy, cheerfully waved a pitchfork above his head, and called  above the din for three cheers. Those who heard and understood responded; the  others gaped wonderingly. But when they saw Sandy they laughed boisterously and  renewed the cheer. Sandy ignored them. He passed on and approached the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noding ad all,&rdquo; Mrs. Holstein  said when Sandy explained. &ldquo;It yust vos some vind. Efery shild haf dot. My  Yacob he haf it; und he shqveal so dot Holstein he get not no sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you give him?&rdquo; Sandy  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gif him der guraveeseet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy couldn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Guraveeseet</i>,&rdquo; Mrs. Holstein repeated excitedly; &ldquo;<i>Guraveeseet!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy shook his head and looked  stupid.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holstein turned and reached  down a tin from the mantelpiece containing caraway seeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h!&rdquo; Sandy said with an  enlightened smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah,&rdquo; Mrs. Holstein squealed; &ldquo;dot  vos it. Tol Mishey Daylor put some hot vater on him und gif a leetle to der  shild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Sandy said, &ldquo;you pour hot  water on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; and the German woman  laughed pleasantly at Sandy&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which do you give it?&rdquo; Sandy  inquired further, &ldquo;the <i>seeds</i> or the <i>water?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Holstein broke into a loud  shriek of merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Der seets,&rdquo; she screamed, &ldquo;vould  stop its moud aldergedder, und you vould haf only dwins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it th&rsquo; <i>water</i>, then?&rdquo; Sandy said, getting impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, der <i>vater.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was satisfied and turned to  go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Und if dot don&rsquo; make him quiet,&rdquo;  Mrs. Holstein added, following Sandy to the yard, &ldquo;yust hold him by der leg und  der vind it run oud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, hold it upside down?&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mid its head down&mdash;yust like it  vos a vallaby; Holstein he hold Yacob like dot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Sandy said, and hurried  away.</p>
<p>As Sandy passed the thresher again  old Holstein, covered in chaff and dust, left the winnower and intercepted him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear aboud dot,&rdquo; he said  gravely, holding Sandy by the hand. &ldquo;Mein Got! dot vos a great lot.&rdquo; And he  shook his head.</p>
<p>The man on the stack opened fire  on Sandy again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take not no nodice of him,&rdquo;  Holstein said, &ldquo;dot fool he vos only yealous; he been merriet a vife dirteen  year und he haf noding yet.&rdquo; Then he shook hands again with Sandy and said: &ldquo;I  congradeelade you, my man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy hastened away, and panted  home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only <i>wind</i>,&rdquo; he said, stumbling inside. &ldquo;Get some caraway seeds and pour  hot water on them and give it some; hers gets it just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate placed the limp, wailing  infant in Sandy&rsquo;s arms while she searched the house for caraway seeds. But none  was to be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, then,&rdquo; Sandy  said eagerly; &ldquo;if you hold it by the legs with its head down she says it&rsquo;ll do  just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;and <i>hurt</i> it!&rdquo; Kate moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>won&rsquo;t!</i>&rdquo; Sandy insisted. &ldquo;They did it to <i>all</i> theirs! . . Let <i>me</i>.&rdquo;  And he stretched the babe on the sofa, and fumbled clumsily about its long  clothes in search of its legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful! Oh, be careful!&rdquo; Kate  cried, holding up her hands.</p>
<p>Sandy found its legs, and slowly  upended the squalling offspring.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page233.jpg" alt="upended" width="535" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Don&mdash; don&mdash; <i>don&rsquo;t!</i>&rdquo; from Kate.</p>
<p>But Sandy held it up. Then between  its screams a gulp of air escaped from the mite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h,&rdquo; Kate gasped; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up&mdash;<i>it&rsquo;s got it up!</i>&rdquo; And she threw out her  hands and took possession of the infant again and hugged it, and it became calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told y&rsquo;!&rdquo; Sandy said, grinning  triumphantly. &ldquo;I told y&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The triplets were a great drag on  Kate. Her hands were always full. They kept her occupied, and made the house  merry. All day long she was going&mdash;feeding them, hushing them, and putting them  to sleep. And often when Sandy came for dinner nothing would be ready, and he  would have to take charge of some of the triplets; walk up and down with them  in his arms, singing in his own peculiar way to humour them; while Kate flew  round and prepared the meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Three&rsquo;s</i> th&rsquo; <i>devil</i>, isn&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo; Sandy would say, shaking the youngsters about in his clumsy efforts to  silence them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Kate would answer,  banging cups and things on the table; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s just as much trouble with one as  there is with three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at night, sometimes, Kate was  inclined to agree with Sandy, for then something or other always went wrong  with the triplets. They didn&rsquo;t like being in the dark, so Sandy reckoned.  Frequently one would start out of its sleep and bleat; and to prevent its cries  from waking the others Kate would slip into the front room with it and shake it  about in there before the fire, if any were left, to soothe it. In a while,  Sandy, with one of the others in his big arms, would creep out in his shirt and  bare feet and join her. For an hour or so they&rsquo;d both pace the room together,  and just when things were getting quiet the one in the bed would break out.  Then Kate would carefully load Sandy with her charge, and with whispered  injunctions to move quietly about with them, run back to the bed to silence the  other. But generally the &ldquo;other&rdquo;&mdash;mostly the girl&mdash;was the hardest to console,  and for no obvious reason whatever would scream itself into convulsions, and  almost drive Kate to distraction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>There, then!</i> . . . <i>There, then!</i> . . . <i>There, then!</i>&rdquo; she would croon,  while her tears would flow and wet the youngster&rsquo;s cheek. And in the middle of  it all something would suddenly go wrong with Sandy, and the pair in his charge  would struggle with him and squeal themselves black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it <i>is</i> th&rsquo; devil!&rdquo; Sandy would groan, and Kate wouldn&rsquo;t contradict him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always afraid something &rsquo;ll  go wrong with them,&rdquo; Kate used to say to Sandy, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do  if anything happened to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day something <i>did</i> happen. Kate had carefully settled  the triplets on the floor, with some bagging under them to prevent them  catching cold or eating holes in the ground floor, and had placed the &ldquo;teat&rdquo; of  a milk bottle in the mouth of one while she put some clothes through the  wash-tub. When she looked in again to see how they were getting on, the &ldquo;teat&rdquo;  was missing, and she took alarm, and ran out and called Sandy from the plough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness me! What are we going to  do?&rdquo; Kate cried, wringing her hands, &ldquo;it swallowed the &lsquo;teat&rsquo; while I was washing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy looked grave. &ldquo;What about  oil?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Kate rushed away and procured  some, and they gave the infant a dose. Then Kate took it up in her lap and  nursed it, and wept over it.</p>
<p>Sandy sat looking on, and thinking  hard of what might result, when something suddenly occurred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it was that one  swallowed it?&rdquo; he asked with increased anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Kate said,  doubtingly, &ldquo;only that it had it in its mouth when I went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it might have been one of the  others swallowed it!&rdquo; Sandy suggested.</p>
<p>Kate stared with apprehension at  the two &ldquo;cooing&rdquo; mites on the bagging, and said, &ldquo;It might,&rdquo; and put more doubt  into Sandy&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they had  better get a dose, too, and be on the safe side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate agreed with Sandy, and jumped  up and administered oil all round. Then she lifted the squealing infants from  the floor, and the teat dropped from the clothes of one of them.</p>
<p>Sandy stared for a moment, then  called Kate a fool and went back to the plough.</p>

  McMaster&rsquo;s Traction Engine</b></h2>
<p>Rain came just when it was wanted,  and Sandy&rsquo;s barley matured and ripened, and was a good crop.</p>
<p>McMaster&rsquo;s steam thresher was in  the district, and Sandy engaged it to thresh his barley. A steam thresher was a  novelty at Sleepy Creek, and the rapidity with which it put the stacks through  and shifted itself to the next selection was a matter of wonder to everyone,  and afforded the selectors food for conversation, and kept them idle.</p>
<p>While the thresher was at work,  wild Dick Saunders came to see Sandy. Dick had had a crop too&mdash;it was a pleasant  change for Dick. He reaped a few drayloads of wheat from his ten acres, and was  anxious to know from Sandy the rates McMaster charged for threshing. Sandy told  him: &ldquo;Nine-pence a bag for anything over thirty bags, and sixpence an hour for  the men. Anything under that &pound;2 for the shift.&rdquo; Then Dick approached McMaster;  but the proprietor of the steam thresher shook his head, and said he had passed  Dick&rsquo;s place, and wouldn&rsquo;t take the machine back that way for less than &pound;3 10s.;  and it wouldn&rsquo;t pay him to return even for that sum, he reckoned.</p>
<p>Dick cursed McMaster with all his  might; called him a bumble-footed Jew, and named two or three different kinds  of places where he would see him to before he&rsquo;d give &pound;3 10s. for threshing five  or six bags of wheat; and ended by saying he would sooner put a fire-stick in  it! Then Dick went away, and left the yard-gate open, and Mrs. Hogan&rsquo;s cows  walked in, and one of them chewed McMaster&rsquo;s vest coat, which was hanging on  the guard-iron of a dray, and tramped on his watch.</p>
<p>Next day was New Year&rsquo;s day, and  McMaster and his men were in town enjoying themselves. The thresher was silent,  and stood at the stacks with a tarpaulin thrown over portions of her.</p>
<p>Dick came to see Sandy again, and  they sat under the verandah and talked about McMaster and Dick&rsquo;s bit of wheat.  Dick was despondent, and said he didn&rsquo;t know what the devil he was going to do.  Uncle, with an old newspaper in his hand, came out and joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell y&rsquo; what <i>I&rsquo;d</i> do,&rdquo; Uncle put in cheerfully&mdash; (Dick  scowled heavily on him)&mdash;&rdquo;I&rsquo;d go straight away, now&rdquo; &mdash;Uncle went on&mdash; &ldquo;get a  couple o&rsquo; drays, put your wheat on &rsquo;em, bring it over here an&rsquo; shove it through  the machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; who the devil&rsquo;s going to  drive th&rsquo; engine?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Me</i>,&rdquo; said Uncle.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy both stared at  Uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Dick said&mdash; &ldquo;<i>Can</i> y&rsquo;  drive it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should think so,&rdquo; he  answered, &ldquo;seein&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been among &rsquo;em all me life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned his incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose y&rsquo; seen me take  charge of her yes&rsquo;d&rsquo;y, didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo;, when the driver was away?&rdquo; Uncle answered,  and Sandy admitted he had. And, in truth, Uncle, who since the arrival of the  machine had put in all his time poking about the engine, had been left in  charge of her for a few moments, but all he had to do was to stand with his  hands behind his back looking at her.</p>
<p>Dick thought he saw something in  the suggestion, and began to treat Uncle with respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you think you can manage  it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll very soon bring the stack across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Manage</i> it!&rdquo;&mdash;and Uncle straightened up his shrunken little form. &ldquo;Go  and bring th&rsquo; stuff,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon start th&rsquo; blessed engine.&rdquo; And he  threw his arms about like one eager to get to work.</p>
<p>Sandy and Saunders didn&rsquo;t waste  any more time. They caught the horses, put them in the drays, and went for Dick&rsquo;s  stack. Uncle proceeded to the engine, and filled the boiler with water, and put  a fire into her. Kate came out and looked on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All that&rsquo;s to be done now,&rdquo; Uncle  explained, &ldquo;is to wait till the hand of the clock points to 100, then draw the  lever, an&rsquo; away she goes.&rdquo; Then he touched her here and there with a handful of  cotton waste. &ldquo;McMaster &rsquo;ll be a bit surprised,&rdquo; he added with a chuckle, &ldquo;when  he comes back and finds we&rsquo;ve put Dick&rsquo;s wheat through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Saunders, accompanied by  Mrs. Saunders, returned with two large dray-loads of wheat, and drew up beside  the thresher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to manage?&rdquo;  Sandy said, looking perplexed. Then they put their heads together to solve the  labour problem. After a while Sandy made a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feed the thresher,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;Dick can look after the bags; Mrs. Saunders pitch off the dray; Uncle drive  the engine, and Kate &rsquo;ll give a hand from one to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed a satisfactory  arrangement, and Mrs. Saunders climbed on to the load, and commenced heaving  sheaves about.</p>
<p>Uncle walked round about the  machine to assure himself that the gear and everything connected with the plant  was in going order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are y&rsquo; ready?&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Sandy answered, and Uncle  blew the whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good man!&rdquo; Saunders yelled  encouragingly. Then Uncle drew the lever, and off went the engine. Off went the  horses, too, with the load of wheat, and with Mrs. Saunders on top of it. Saunders&rsquo;  horses weren&rsquo;t used to traction engines; and they raced across the cultivation  paddock and dropped sheaves all about it, and dropped Mrs. Saunders on it also.  The engine tore itself away from the rest of the plant, and with a vigorous <i>puff-puff!</i> <i>puff-puff!</i> made straight for Sandy&rsquo;s cow-yard.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2400041h-images/page242.jpg" alt="sheaves" width="650" height="465"></p>
<p>Sandy stood staring for a moment  or two as though he were paralysed; then he yelled to Uncle and pursued the  engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stop &rsquo;er!</i>&rdquo; Sandy shouted, &ldquo;<i>Stop  &rsquo;er!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle tugged and fumbled at  various parts of the works, and increased her speed. Sandy headed her, and  waved his hands about frantically, but the engine took no notice of him.</p>
<p>Uncle was in distress.</p>
<p>The engine went right through the  yard and burst it all up; and when Uncle heard the timber cracking he deserted  his post&mdash;jumped to the ground, and one of the heavy rails fell across his neck  and held him down. Sandy hurriedly dragged it off and gave chase again. He  snatched up a log and dropped it in front of one of the wheels. The engine  stepped over it and puffed along leisurely. The wire fence was in front. She  took it all away with her, and went steaming up the grass paddock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, come an&rsquo; give  a hand someone!&rdquo; Sandy cried, distractedly.</p>
<p>Saunders, who had abandoned his  horses, overtook Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in th&rsquo; name of th&rsquo; devil did  he say he could drive it for?&rdquo; he shouted into Sandy&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the good of  askin&rsquo; that <i>now?</i>&rdquo; Sandy shouted back.  &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, get hold of this an&rsquo; see if it &rsquo;ll stop her,&rdquo; and between them they  heaved a big log in front of the traction. She climbed over it, and rubbed  herself against an iron bark tree, and tore a heavy hanging limb to the ground,  which nearly took Sandy&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible! terrible!&rdquo; Sandy  moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a &mdash; caution!!&rdquo; from  Saunders, and both trotted and panted beside the runaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some way of  stopping her,&rdquo; Dick gasped, and placing his foot on the step he mounted her  boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull that thing near y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sandy  shouted,&mdash; &ldquo;an&rsquo; see if it &rsquo;ll do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick pulled the &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; and the  engine whistled as if it were in pain, and he jumped off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aint good enough,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;th&rsquo;  darn boiler or something might burst on a feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stump slewed the engine round  and altered her course, and she bore down on the corn, whistling all the time.  Sandy groaned heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for the wire,&rdquo; Saunders  shouted, and they both hung back till the engine tore up the cultivation-paddock  fence; then they pursued her through the corn. She cut a big clearing through  the crop. On the other side was a lane. She cut the lane in two, and approached  an embankment surrounding a government dam.</p>
<p>Sandy groaned.</p>
<p>The engine climbed the embankment  and dropped over the other side, and covered herself in mud and water, and  fizzled and whistled and bubbled, and then was quiet.</p>
<p>Sandy couldn&rsquo;t sleep that night,  and in the morning when McMaster and his men turned up he couldn&rsquo;t be found&mdash;he  was busy in the corn.</p>
<p>Kate told McMaster where the  engine was, and said Uncle was to blame. McMaster didn&rsquo;t take it well at all;  he stuttered and swore, and threatened to sue Sandy and Uncle, and everyone who  had a hand in shifting it. Then he and his men proceeded to the dam, and when  they saw the traction, they cursed Sandy and Uncle again. But Sandy never came  out of the corn.</p>
<p>McMaster went away and procured  all the draught horses in the place, about fifty, and hooked them to the  engine; then he and all his men, and all the farmers about, except Sandy and  Dick Saunders, hammered the horses with sticks, and shouted at them, till they  pulled the engine out of the dam. Then they scraped the mud off it.</p>
<p>The engine didn&rsquo;t receive much  damage, but McMaster wouldn&rsquo;t thresh any more barley for Sandy.</p>
