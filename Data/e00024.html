  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ToanOldMate"></a>To an Old Mate</b></h2>
  <p>Old Mate!&nbsp; In the gusty old weather,<br>
    When our hopes and our troubles were new,<br>
    In the years spent in wearing out leather,<br>
    I found you unselfish and true &mdash;<br>
    I have gathered these verses together<br>
    For the sake of our friendship and you.</p>
  <p>You may think for awhile, and with reason,<br>
    Though still with a kindly regret,<br>
    That I've left it full late in the season<br>
    To prove I remember you yet;<br>
    But you'll never judge me by their treason<br>
    Who profit by friends &mdash; and forget.</p>
  <p>I remember, Old Man, I remember &mdash;<br>
    The tracks that we followed are clear &mdash;<br>
    The jovial last nights of December,<br>
    The solemn first days of the year,<br>
    Long tramps through the clearings and timber,<br>
    Short partings on platform and pier.</p>
  <p>I can still feel the spirit that bore us,<br>
    And often the old stars will shine &mdash;<br>
    I remember the last spree in chorus<br>
    For the sake of that other Lang Syne,<br>
    When the tracks lay divided before us,<br>
    Your path through the future and mine.</p>
  <p>Through the frost-wind that cut like whip-lashes,<br>
    Through the ever-blind haze of the drought &mdash;<br>
    And in fancy at times by the flashes<br>
    Of light in the darkness of doubt &mdash;<br>
    I have followed the tent poles and ashes<br>
    Of camps that we moved further out.</p>
  <p>You will find in these pages a trace of<br>
    That side of our past which was bright,<br>
    And recognise sometimes the face of<br>
    A friend who has dropped out of sight &mdash;<br>
    I send them along in the place of<br>
    The letters I promised to write.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IntheDaysWhentheWorldwasWide"></a>In the Days When the World was Wide</b></h2>
  <p>    The world is narrow and ways are short, and our lives are dull and slow,<br>
    For little is new where the crowds resort, and less where the wanderers go;<br>
    Greater, or smaller, the same old things we see by the dull road-side &mdash;<br>
    And tired of all is the spirit that sings of the days when the world was
    wide.<br>
    When the North was hale in the march of Time, and the South and the West
    were new,<br>
    And the gorgeous East was a pantomime, as it seemed in our boyhood&rsquo;s
    view;<br>
    When Spain was first on the waves of change, and proud in the ranks of pride,<br>
And all was wonderful, new and strange in the days when the world was wide.</p>
  <p>Then a man could fight if his heart were bold, and win if his faith were
    true &mdash;<br>
    Were it love, or honour, or power, or gold, or all that our hearts pursue;<br>
    Could live to the world for the family name, or die for the family pride,<br>
    Could fly from sorrow, and wrong, and shame in the days when the world was
    wide.</p>
  <p>They sailed away in the ships that sailed ere science controlled the main,<br>
    When the strong, brave heart of a man prevailed as &rsquo;twill never prevail
    again;<br>
    They knew not whither, nor much they cared &mdash; let Fate or the winds
    decide &mdash;<br>
    The worst of the Great Unknown they dared in the days when the world was
    wide.</p>
  <p>They raised new stars on the silent sea that filled their hearts with awe;<br>
    They came to many a strange countree and marvellous sights they saw.<br>
    The villagers gaped at the tales they told, and old eyes glistened with pride &mdash;<br>
    When barbarous cities were paved with gold in the days when the world was
    wide.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas honest metal and honest wood, in the days of the Outward Bound,<br>
    When men were gallant and ships were good &mdash; roaming the wide world
    round.<br>
    The gods could envy a leader then when &lsquo;Follow me, lads!&rsquo; he
    cried &mdash;<br>
    They faced each other and fought like men in the days when the world was
    wide.</p>
  <p>They tried to live as a freeman should &mdash; they were happier men than
    we,<br>
    In the glorious days of wine and blood, when Liberty crossed the sea;<br>
    &rsquo;Twas a comrade true or a foeman then, and a trusty sword well tried &mdash;<br>
    They faced each other and fought like men in the days when the world was
    wide.</p>
  <p>The good ship bound for the Southern seas when the beacon was Ballarat,<br>
    With a &lsquo;Ship ahoy!&rsquo; on the freshening breeze, &lsquo;Where bound?&rsquo; and &lsquo;What
    ship&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; &mdash;<br>
    The emigrant train to New Mexico &mdash; the rush to the Lachlan Side &mdash;<br>
    Ah! faint is the echo of Westward Ho! from the days when the world was wide.</p>
  <p>South, East, and West in advance of Time &mdash; and, ay! in advance of
    Thought<br>
    Those brave men rose to a height sublime &mdash; and is it for this they
    fought?<br>
    And is it for this damned life we praise the god-like spirit that died<br>
    At Eureka Stockade in the Roaring Days with the days when the world was wide?</p>
  <p>We fight like women, and feel as much; the thoughts of our hearts we guard;<br>
    Where scarcely the scorn of a god could touch, the sneer of a sneak hits
      hard;<br>
    The treacherous tongue and cowardly pen, the weapons of curs, decide &mdash;<br>
    They faced each other and fought like men in the days when the world was
    wide.</p>
  <p>Think of it all &mdash; of the life that is! Study your friends and foes!<br>
    Study the past! And answer this: &lsquo;Are these times better than those?&rsquo;<br>
    The life-long quarrel, the paltry spite, the sting of your poisoned pride!<br>
    No matter who fell it were better to fight as they did when the world was
    wide.</p>
  <p>Boast as you will of your mateship now &mdash; crippled and mean and sly &mdash;<br>
    The lines of suspicion on friendship&rsquo;s brow were traced since the days
    gone by.<br>
    There was room in the long, free lines of the van to fight for it side by
    side &mdash;<br>
    There was beating-room for the heart of a man in the days when the world
was wide.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>    With its dull, brown days of a-shilling-an-hour the dreary year drags round:<br>
    Is this the result of Old England&rsquo;s power? &mdash; the bourne of the
    Outward Bound?<br>
    Is this the sequel of Westward Ho! &mdash; of the days of Whate&rsquo;er
    Betide?<br>
    The heart of the rebel makes answer &lsquo;No! We&rsquo;ll fight till the
world grows wide!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The world shall yet be a wider world &mdash; for the tokens are manifest;<br>
    East and North shall the wrongs be hurled that followed us South and West.<br>
    The march of Freedom is North by the Dawn! Follow, whate&rsquo;er betide!<br>
    Sons of the Exiles, march! March on! March till the world grows wide!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="FacesintheStreet"></a>Faces in the Street</b></h2>
  <p>    They lie, the men who tell us in a loud decisive tone<br>
    That want is here a stranger, and that misery&rsquo;s unknown;<br>
    For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet<br>
    My window-sill is level with the faces in the street &mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting past, drifting past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beat of weary feet &mdash;<br>
While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
  <p> And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,<br>
    To see upon those faces stamped the marks of Want and Care;<br>
    I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet<br>
    In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street &mdash;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting on, drifting on,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the scrape of restless feet;<br>
    I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
  <p>In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky<br>
    The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,<br>
    Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,<br>
    Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street &mdash;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing in, flowing in,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beat of hurried feet &mdash;<br>
    Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
  <p>The human river dwindles when &rsquo;Tis past the hour of eight,<br>
    Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;<br>
    But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat<br>
    The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street &mdash;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grinding body, grinding soul,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielding scarce enough to eat &mdash;<br>
    Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
  <p>And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down<br>
    Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town,<br>
    Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street,<br>
    Tells of the city&rsquo;s unemployed upon his weary beat &mdash;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting round, drifting round,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the tread of listless feet &mdash;<br>
    Ah! My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street.</p>
  <p>And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away,<br>
    And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day,<br>
    Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat,<br>
    Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street &mdash;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ebbing out, ebbing out,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the drag of tired feet,<br>
    While my heart is aching dumbly for the faces in the street.</p>
  <p>And now all blurred and smirched with vice the day&rsquo;s sad pages end,<br>
    For while the short &lsquo;large hours&rsquo; toward the longer &lsquo;small
    hours&rsquo; trend,<br>
    With smiles that mock the wearer, and with words that half entreat,<br>
    Delilah pleads for custom at the corner of the street &mdash;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking down, sinking down,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battered wreck by tempests beat &mdash;<br>
    A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street.</p>
  <p>But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes,<br>
    For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums,<br>
    Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet,<br>
    And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street &mdash;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotting out, rotting out,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lack of air and meat &mdash;<br>
    In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street.</p>
  <p>I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure<br>
    Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor?<br>
    Ah! Mammon&rsquo;s slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror
    beat,<br>
    When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrong things and the bad things<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sad things that we meet<br>
    In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street.</p>
  <p>I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still,<br>
    And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill;<br>
    But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet,<br>
    They haunted me &mdash; the shadows of those faces in the street,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitting by, flitting by,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitting by with noiseless feet,<br>
    And with cheeks but little paler than the real ones in the street.</p>
  <p>Once I cried: &lsquo;Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure,<br>
    Now show me in a vision for the wrongs of Earth a cure.&rsquo;<br>
    And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city&rsquo;s street,<br>
    And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming near, coming near,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a drum&rsquo;s dull distant beat,<br>
    And soon I saw the army that was marching down the street.</p>
  <p>Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall,<br>
    The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all,<br>
    And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution&rsquo;s heat,<br>
    And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pouring on, pouring on,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a drum&rsquo;s loud threatening beat,<br>
    And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street.</p>
  <p>And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course,<br>
    The warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse,<br>
    But not until a city feels Red Revolution&rsquo;s feet<br>
    Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street &mdash;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreadful everlasting strife<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For scarcely clothes and meat<br>
    In that pent track of living death &mdash; the city&rsquo;s cruel street.</p>

  <p> Then stately ships came sailing<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That beaconed in the South;<br>

  <p>The rough bush roads re-echoed<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar-room&rsquo;s noisy din,<br>
    When troops of stalwart horsemen<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismounted at the inn.<br>
    And oft the hearty greetings<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hearty clasp of hands<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explored the bush with gleams,<br>
    The camping-grounds were crowded<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With caravans of teams;<br>
    Then home the jests were driven,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And good old songs were sung,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round one the grass is green,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spike is rusted in;<br>
    And &rsquo;twas from there his freckled face<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was weary work,<br>
    The creeks were bankers, and the flood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was forty miles round Bourke.</p>
  <p>He said the floods had formed a block,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plains could not be crossed,<br>
    And there was foot-rot in the flock<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hundreds had been lost;<br>

    The publican&rsquo;s words were short and few, and the publican&rsquo;s looks

    And the time had come, as the shearer knew, to carry his swag Out Back.</p>
  <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For time means tucker, and tramp you must, where

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long in the dust and heat&mdash;when summer

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With stinted stomachs and blistered feet, they carry

    But men were many, and sheds were full, for work in the town was slack&mdash;<br>
    The traveller never got hands in wool, though he tramped for a year Out Back.</p>
  <p>In stifling noons when his back was wrung by its load, and the air seemed
    dead,<br>
    And the water warmed in the bag that hung to his aching arm like lead,<br>
    Or in times of flood, when plains were seas, and the scrubs were cold and
    black,<br>
    He ploughed in mud to his trembling knees, and paid for his sins Out Back.</p>
  <p>He blamed himself in the year &lsquo;Too Late&rsquo;&mdash;in the heaviest
    hours of life&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas little he dreamed that a shearing-mate had care of his home and
  wife;<br>
    There are times when wrongs from your kindred come, and treacherous tongues
    attack&mdash;<br>
    When a man is better away from home, and dead to the world, Out Back.</p>
  <p>And dirty and careless and old he wore, as his lamp of hope grew dim;<br>
    He tramped for years till the swag he bore seemed part of himself to him.<br>
    As a bullock drags in the sandy ruts, he followed the dreary track,<br>
    With never a thought but to reach the huts when the sun went down Out Back.</p>
  <p>It chanced one day, when the north wind blew in his face like a furnace-breath,<br>
    He left the track for a tank he knew&mdash;&rsquo;twas a short-cut to his
    death;<br>
    For the bed of the tank was hard and dry, and crossed with many a crack,<br>
    And, oh! it&rsquo;s a terrible thing to die of thirst in the scrub Out Back.</p>
  <p>A drover came, but the fringe of law was eastward many a mile;<br>
    He never reported the thing he saw, for it was not worth his while.<br>
    The tanks are full and the grass is high in the mulga off the track,<br>

  <p>I&nbsp;met&nbsp;her on the Lachlan Side&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A darling girl I thought her,<br>
    And ere I left I swore I&rsquo;d win<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free-selector&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
  <p>I milked her father&rsquo;s cows a month,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I won the daughter.</p>

    And what you&rsquo;ll have to do to win<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A free-selector&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And washed my mouth with water;<br>
    I had a shave before I kissed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free-selector&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
  <p>Then, rising in the frosty morn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought the cows for Mary,<br>
    And when I&rsquo;d milked a bucketful<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took it to the dairy.</p>
  <p>I poured the milk into the dish<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Mary held the strainer,<br>
    I summoned heart to speak my wish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, oh! her blush grew plainer.</p>
  <p>I told her I must leave the place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that I would miss her;<br>
    At first she turned away her face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she let me kiss her.</p>
  <p>I put the bucket on the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in my arms I caught her:<br>

  <p>It chanced upon the very day we&rsquo;d got the shearing done,<br>
    A buggy brought a stranger to the West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Run;<br>
    He had a round and jolly face, and he was sleek and stout,<br>
    He drove right up between the huts and called the super out.<br>
    We chaps were smoking after tea, and heard the swell enquire<br>
    For one as travelled by the name of &lsquo;Dunn of Nevertire&rsquo;.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Dunn of Nevertire;<br>
    There wasn&rsquo;t one of us but knew Jack Dunn of Nevertire.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jack Dunn of Nevertire,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I was a mate of his;<br>
    And now it&rsquo;s twenty years since I set eyes upon his phiz.<br>
    There is no whiter man than Jack&mdash;no straighter south the line,<br>
    There is no hand in all the land I&rsquo;d sooner grip in mine;<br>
    To help a mate in trouble Jack would go through flood and fire.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Jack from Nevertire;<br>
    He stuck to me through thick and thin, Jack Dunn of Nevertire.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did a wild and foolish thing while Jack and I were mates,<br>
    And I disgraced my guv&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s name, an&rsquo; wished to try the
    States.<br>
    My lamps were turned to Yankee Land, for I&rsquo;d some people there,<br>
    And I was right when someone sent the money for my fare;<br>
    I thought &rsquo;twas Dad until I took the trouble to enquire,<br>
    And found that he who sent the stuff was Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft Dunn of Nevertire;<br>
    He&rsquo;d won some money on a race&mdash;Jack Dunn of Nevertire.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ve returned, by Liverpool, a swell of Yankee brand,<br>
    To reckon, guess, and kalkilate, &rsquo;n&rsquo; wake my native land;<br>
    There is no better land, I swear, in all the wide world round&mdash;<br>
    I smelt the bush a month before we touched King George&rsquo;s Sound!<br>
    And now I&rsquo;ve come to settle down, the top of my desire<br>
    Is just to meet a mate o&rsquo; mine called &lsquo;Dunn of Nevertire&rsquo;.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was raised at Nevertire&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Nevertire;<br>
    He humped his bluey by the name of &lsquo;Dunn of Nevertire&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s poor, and if he is, a proud old fool
    is he;<br>
    But, spite of that, I&rsquo;ll find a way to fix the old gum-tree.<br>
    I&rsquo;ve bought a station in the North&mdash;the best that could be had;<br>
    I want a man to pick the stock&mdash;I want a super bad;<br>
    I want no bully-brute to boss&mdash;no crawling, sneaking liar&mdash;<br>

    I guess he&rsquo;s known up Queensland way&mdash;Jack Dunn of Nevertire.&rsquo;</p>

  &lsquo;I&nbsp;<i>think</i>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen the man you want, I&nbsp;<i>think</i>&nbsp;I

    Had he a jolly kind of face, a free and careless way,<br>
    Gray eyes that always seem&rsquo;d to smile, and hair just turning gray&mdash;<br>
    Clean-shaved, except a light moustache, long-limbed, an&rsquo; tough as wire?&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;<i>That&rsquo;s him! that&rsquo;s Dunn!</i>&rsquo; the stranger roared, &lsquo;Jack
  Dunn of Nevertire!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack D. from Nevertire,<br>
    They said I&rsquo;d find him here, the cuss!&mdash;Jack Dunn of Nevertire.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d know his walk,&rsquo; the stranger cried, &lsquo;though
    sobered, I&rsquo;ll allow.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;I doubt it much,&rsquo; the boss replied, &lsquo;he don&rsquo;t walk
  that way now.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Perhaps he don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; the stranger said, &lsquo;for years were
  hard on Jack;<br>
    But, if he were a mile away, I swear I&rsquo;d know his back.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;I doubt it much,&rsquo; the super said, and sadly puffed his briar,<br>
  &lsquo;I guess he wears a pair of wings&mdash;Jack Dunn of Nevertire;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
    He caught a fever nursing me, Jack Dunn of Nevertire.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We took the stranger round to where a gum-tree stood alone,<br>
    And in the grass beside the trunk he saw a granite stone;<br>
    The names of Dunn and Nevertire were plainly written there&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m all broke up,&rsquo; the stranger said, in sorrow and despair,<br>
  &lsquo;I guess he has a wider run, the man that I require;<br>
    He&rsquo;s got a river-frontage now, Jack Dunn of Nevertire;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Straight Dunn of Nevertire,<br>

    His cap-peak and his sabre<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were glancing in the sun.<br>
&rsquo;Twas New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and slowly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the ridges low<br>
    The sad Old Year was drifting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where the old years go.</p>
  <p>The trooper&rsquo;s mind was reading<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love-page of his life&mdash;<br>
    His love for Mary Wylie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere she was Blackman&rsquo;s wife;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the heart a rival won,<br>
    For he knew that there was trouble<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out there on Blackman&rsquo;s Run.</p>
  <p>The sapling shades had lengthened,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer day was late,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the homestead gate.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can leave a lasting trace,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above our homestead hang;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has joined M&rsquo;Durmer&rsquo;s gang.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! save him, save him, Campbell!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg in friendship&rsquo;s name!<br>
    For if they take and hang him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife would die of shame.<br>
    Could Mary or her sisters<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold up their heads again,<br>
    And face a woman&rsquo;s malice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or claim the love of men?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And if he does a murder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twere better we were dead.<br>
    Don&rsquo;t take him, Trooper Campbell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a price be on his head;<br>
    But shoot him! shoot him, Campbell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you meet him face to face,<br>
    And save him from the gallows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And us from that disgrace.&rsquo;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still he is your child;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But &rsquo;tis not that alone,<br>
    He&rsquo;ll bring dishonour to a name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I&rsquo;d be proud to own.</p>

    And listen there when darkness shut<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearer spur in silence deep;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steal home and cry herself to sleep.</p>

  <p>Three bushmen one morning rode up to an inn,<br>
    And one of them called for the drinks with a grin;<br>
    They&rsquo;d only returned from a trip to the North,<br>
    And, eager to greet them, the landlord came forth.<br>
    He absently poured out a glass of Three Star.<br>
    And set down that drink with the rest on the bar.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There, that is for Harry,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s queer,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the very same glass that he drank from last year;<br>
    His name&rsquo;s on the glass, you can read it like print,<br>
    He scratched it himself with an old piece of flint;<br>
    I remember his drink&mdash;it was always Three Star&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    And the landlord looked out through the door of the bar.</p>
  <p>He looked at the horses, and counted but three:<br>
  &lsquo;You were always together&mdash;where&rsquo;s Harry?&rsquo; cried he.<br>
    Oh, sadly they looked at the glass as they said,<br>
  &lsquo;You may put it away, for our old mate is dead;&rsquo;<br>
    But one, gazing out o&rsquo;er the ridges afar,<br>
    Said, &lsquo;We owe him a shout&mdash;leave the glass on the bar.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They thought of the far-away grave on the plain,<br>
    They thought of the comrade who came not again,<br>
    They lifted their glasses, and sadly they said:<br>
  &lsquo;We drink to the name of the mate who is dead.&rsquo;<br>
    And the sunlight streamed in, and a light like a star<br>
    Seemed to glow in the depth of the glass on the bar.</p>
  <p>And still in that shanty a tumbler is seen,<br>
    It stands by the clock, ever polished and clean;<br>
    And often the strangers will read as they pass<br>
    The name of a bushman engraved on the glass;<br>
    And though on the shelf but a dozen there are,<br>
    That glass never stands with the rest on the bar.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShantyontheRise"></a>The Shanty on the Rise</b></h2>
  <p>When&nbsp;the caravans of wool-teams climbed the ranges from the West,<br>
    On a spur among the mountains stood &lsquo;The Bullock-drivers&rsquo; Rest&rsquo;;<br>
    It was built of bark and saplings, and was rather rough inside,<br>
    But &rsquo;twas good enough for bushmen in the careless days that died&mdash;<br>
    Just a quiet little shanty kept by &lsquo;Something-in-Disguise&rsquo;,<br>
    As the bushmen called the landlord of the Shanty on the Rise.</p>
  <p>City swells who &lsquo;do the Royal&rsquo; would have called the Shanty
    low,<br>
    But &rsquo;twas better far and purer than some toney pubs I know;<br>
    For the patrons of the Shanty had the principles of men,<br>
    And the spieler, if he struck it, wasn&rsquo;t welcome there again.<br>
    You could smoke and drink in quiet, yarn, or else soliloquise,<br>
    With a decent lot of fellows in the Shanty on the Rise.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas the bullock-driver&rsquo;s haven when his team was on the road,<br>
    And the waggon-wheels were groaning as they ploughed beneath the load;<br>
    And I mind how weary teamsters struggled on while it was light,<br>
    Just to camp within a cooey of the Shanty for the night;<br>
    And I think the very bullocks raised their heads and fixed their eyes<br>
    On the candle in the window of the Shanty on the Rise.</p>
  <p>And the bullock-bells were clanking from the marshes on the flats<br>
    As we hurried to the Shanty, where we hung our dripping hats;<br>
    And we took a drop of something that was brought at our desire,<br>
    As we stood with steaming moleskins in the kitchen by the fire.<br>
    Oh! it roared upon a fireplace of the good, old-fashioned size,<br>
    When the rain came down the chimney of the Shanty on the Rise.</p>
  <p>They got up a Christmas party in the Shanty long ago,<br>
    While I camped with Jimmy Nowlett on the riverbank below;<br>
    Poor old Jim was in his glory&mdash;they&rsquo;d elected him M.C.,<br>
    For there wasn&rsquo;t such another raving lunatic as he.<br>
  &lsquo;Mr. Nowlett, Mr. Swaller!&rsquo; shouted Something-in-Disguise,<br>
    As we walked into the parlour of the Shanty on the Rise.</p>
  <p>There is little real pleasure in the city where I am&mdash;<br>
    There&rsquo;s a swarry round the corner with its mockery and sham;<br>
    But a fellow can be happy when around the room he whirls<br>
    In a party up the country with the jolly country girls.<br>
    Why, at times I almost fancied I was dancing on the skies,<br>
    When I danced with Mary Carey in the Shanty on the Rise.</p>
  <p>Jimmy came to me and whispered, and I muttered, &lsquo;Go along!&rsquo;<br>
    But he shouted, &lsquo;Mr. Swaller will oblige us with a song!&rsquo;<br>
    And at first I said I wouldn&rsquo;t, and I shammed a little too,<br>
    Till the girls began to whisper, &lsquo;Mr. Swallow, now, ah,&nbsp;<i>do</i>!&rsquo;<br>
    So I sang a song of something &rsquo;bout the love that never dies,<br>
    And the chorus shook the rafters of the Shanty on the Rise.</p>
  <p>Jimmy burst his concertina, and the bullock-drivers went<br>
    For the corpse of Joe the Fiddler, who was sleeping in his tent;<br>
    Joe was tired and had lumbago, and he wouldn&rsquo;t come, he said,<br>
    But the case was very urgent, so they pulled him out of bed;<br>
    And they fetched him, for the bushmen knew that Something-in-Disguise<br>
    Had a cure for Joe&rsquo;s lumbago in the Shanty on the Rise.</p>
  <p>Jim and I were rather quiet while escorting Mary home,<br>
  &rsquo;Neath the stars that hung in clusters, near and distant, from the dome;<br>
    And we walked so very silent&mdash;being lost in reverie&mdash;<br>
    That we heard the settlers&rsquo;-matches rustle softly on the tree;<br>
    And I wondered who would win her when she said her sweet good-byes&mdash;<br>
    But she died at one-and-twenty, and was buried on the Rise.</p>
  <p>I suppose the Shanty vanished from the ranges long ago,<br>
    And the girls are mostly married to the chaps I used to know;<br>
    My old chums are in the distance&mdash;some have crossed the border-line,<br>
    But in fancy still their glasses chink against the rim of mine.<br>
    And, upon the very centre of the greenest spot that lies<br>
    In my fondest recollection, stands the Shanty on the Rise.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till&mdash;a wreck goes down with a wreck.</p>
  <p>A smoke and a yarn on the deck by day,<br>

  <p>Cleave to your country, home, and friends,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Die in a sordid strife&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your love be forced from home,<br>
    And you dare enough, and your heart be stout,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is your own to roam.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve never a love that can sting my pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor a friend to prove untrue;<br>

  <p>But why be bitter? The world is cold<br>

  <p>I had a friend, ere my first ship sailed,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meet him everywhere.</p>
  <p>I had a chum. When the times were tight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We starved in Australian scrubs;<br>
    We froze together in parks at night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laughed together in pubs.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a sense of humour keen,<br>
    And catch a glimpse in a passing phiz<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his broad, good-humoured grin.</p>
  <p>And I had a love&mdash;&rsquo;twas a love to prize&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I never went back again . . .<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sweeney"></a>Sweeney</b></h2>
  <p>It was&nbsp;somewhere in September, and the sun was going down,<br>
    When I came, in search of &lsquo;copy&rsquo;, to a Darling-River town;<br>
  &lsquo;Come-and-have-a-drink&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll call it&mdash;&rsquo;Tis a
  fitting name, I think&mdash;<br>
    And &rsquo;twas raining, for a wonder, up at Come-and-have-a-drink.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Neath the public-house verandah I was resting on a bunk<br>
    When a stranger rose before me, and he said that he was drunk;<br>
    He apologised for speaking; there was no offence, he swore;<br>
    But he somehow seemed to fancy that he&rsquo;d seen my face before.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No erfence,&rsquo; he said. I told him that he needn&rsquo;t mention
    it,<br>
    For I might have met him somewhere; I had travelled round a bit,<br>
    And I knew a lot of fellows in the bush and in the streets&mdash;<br>
    But a fellow can&rsquo;t remember all the fellows that he meets.</p>
  <p>Very old and thin and dirty were the garments that he wore,<br>
    Just a shirt and pair of trousers, and a boot, and nothing more;<br>
    He was wringing-wet, and really in a sad and sinful plight,<br>
    And his hat was in his left hand, and a bottle in his right.</p>
  <p>His brow was broad and roomy, but its lines were somewhat harsh,<br>
    And a sensual mouth was hidden by a drooping, fair moustache;<br>
    (His hairy chest was open to what poets call the &lsquo;wined&rsquo;,<br>
    And I would have bet a thousand that his pants were gone behind).</p>
  <p>He agreed: &lsquo;Yer can&rsquo;t remember all the chaps yer chance to meet,&rsquo;<br>
    And he said his name was Sweeney&mdash;people lived in Sussex-street.<br>
    He was campin&rsquo; in a stable, but he swore that he was right,<br>
  &lsquo;Only for the blanky horses walkin&rsquo; over him all night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d apparently been fighting, for his face was black-and-blue,<br>
    And he looked as though the horses had been treading on him, too;<br>
    But an honest, genial twinkle in the eye that wasn&rsquo;t hurt<br>
    Seemed to hint of something better, spite of drink and rags and dirt.</p>
  <p>It appeared that he mistook me for a long-lost mate of his&mdash;<br>
    One of whom I was the image, both in figure and in phiz&mdash;<br>
    (He&rsquo;d have had a letter from him if the chap were living still,<br>
    For they&rsquo;d carried swags together from the Gulf to Broken Hill.)</p>
  <p>Sweeney yarned awhile and hinted that his folks were doing well,<br>
    And he told me that his father kept the Southern Cross Hotel;<br>
    And I wondered if his absence was regarded as a loss<br>
    When he left the elder Sweeney&mdash;landlord of the Southern Cross.</p>
  <p>He was born in Parramatta, and he said, with humour grim,<br>
    That he&rsquo;d like to see the city ere the liquor finished him,<br>
    But he couldn&rsquo;t raise the money. He was damned if he could think<br>
    What the Government was doing. Here he offered me a drink.</p>
  <p>I declined&mdash;<i>&rsquo;twas</i>&nbsp;self-denial&mdash;and I lectured
    him on booze,<br>
    Using all the hackneyed arguments that preachers mostly use;<br>
    Things I&rsquo;d heard in temperance lectures (I was young and rather green),<br>
    And I ended by referring to the man he might have been.</p>
  <p>Then a wise expression struggled with the bruises on his face,<br>
    Though his argument had scarcely any bearing on the case:<br>
  &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; sober? Fellers rise and
  fellers fall;<br>
    What I might have been and wasn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t trouble me at all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But he couldn&rsquo;t stay to argue, for his beer was nearly gone.<br>
    He was glad, he said, to meet me, and he&rsquo;d see me later on;<br>
    He guessed he&rsquo;d have to go and get his bottle filled again,<br>
    And he gave a lurch and vanished in the darkness and the rain.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>And of afternoons in cities, when the rain is on the land,<br>
    Visions come to me of Sweeney with his bottle in his hand,<br>
    With the stormy night behind him, and the pub verandah-post&mdash;<br>
    And I wonder why he haunts me more than any other ghost.</p>
  <p>Still I see the shearers drinking at the township in the scrub,<br>
    And the army praying nightly at the door of every pub,<br>
    And the girls who flirt and giggle with the bushmen from the west&mdash;<br>
    But the memory of Sweeney overshadows all the rest.</p>
  <p>Well, perhaps, it isn&rsquo;t funny; there were links between us two&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the rolling plain,<br>
    Young Harry Dale, the drover,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes riding home again.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And light of heart is he,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is trotting by his knee.</p>
  <p>Up Queensland way with cattle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He travelled regions vast;<br>
    And many months have vanished<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since home-folk saw him last.<br>
    He hums a song of someone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hopes to marry soon;<br>
    And hobble-chains and camp-ware<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep jingling to the tune.</p>
  <p>Beyond the hazy dado<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the lower skies<br>
    And yon blue line of ranges<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homestead station lies.<br>
    And thitherward the drover<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jogs through the lazy noon,<br>
    While hobble-chains and camp-ware<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are jingling to a tune.</p>
  <p>An hour has filled the heavens<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With storm-clouds inky black;<br>
    At times the lightning trickles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the drover&rsquo;s track;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His horses&rsquo; strength he tries,<br>
    In hope to reach the river<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the flood shall rise.</p>
  <p>The thunder from above him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes rolling o&rsquo;er the plain;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In torrents falls the rain.<br>
    And every creek and gully<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends forth its little flood,<br>
    Till the river runs a banker,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stained with yellow mud.</p>
  <p>Now Harry speaks to Rover,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best dog on the plains,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In charge of stock again.</p>
  <p>The faithful dog a moment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits panting on the bank,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where his master sank.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fights with failing strength,<br>
    Till, borne down by the waters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old dog sinks at length.</p>
  <p>Across the flooded lowlands<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slopes of sodden loam<br>
    The pack-horse struggles onward,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take dumb tidings home.<br>
    And mud-stained, wet, and weary,<br>

    You know that the troopers are out on your track.&rsquo;<br>
    A laugh and a shake of his obstinate head&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I wanted a dance, and I&rsquo;ll chance it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Some twenty-odd bushmen had come to the &lsquo;ball&rsquo;,<br>
    But Jack from his youth had been known to them all,<br>
    And bushmen are soft where a woman is fair,<br>
    So the love of May Carney protected him there;<br>
    And all the short evening&mdash;it seems like romance&mdash;<br>
    She danced with a bushranger taking his chance.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas midnight&mdash;the dancers stood suddenly still,<br>
    For hoofs had been heard on the side of the hill!<br>
    Ben Duggan, the drover, along the hillside<br>
    Came riding as only a bushman can ride.<br>
    He sprang from his horse, to the shanty he sped&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The troopers are down in the gully!&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Quite close to the homestead the troopers were seen.<br>
  &lsquo;Clear out and ride hard for the ranges, Jack Dean!<br>
    Be quick!&rsquo; said May Carney&mdash;her hand on her heart&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll bluff them awhile, and &rsquo;twill give you a start.&rsquo;<br>
    He lingered a moment&mdash;to kiss her, of course&mdash;<br>
    Then ran to the trees where he&rsquo;d hobbled his horse.</p>
  <p>She ran to the gate, and the troopers were there&mdash;<br>
    The jingle of hobbles came faint on the air&mdash;<br>
    Then loudly she screamed: it was only to drown<br>
    The treacherous clatter of slip-rails let down.<br>
    But troopers are sharp, and she saw at a glance<br>
    That someone was taking a desperate chance.</p>
  <p>They chased, and they shouted, &lsquo;Surrender, Jack Dean!&rsquo;<br>
    They called him three times in the name of the Queen.<br>
    Then came from the darkness the clicking of locks;<br>
    The crack of the rifles was heard in the rocks!<br>
    A shriek and a shout, and a rush of pale men&mdash;<br>
    And there lay the bushranger, chancing it then.</p>
  <p>The sergeant dismounted and knelt on the sod&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Your bushranging&rsquo;s over&mdash;make peace, Jack, with God!&rsquo;<br>
    The bushranger laughed&mdash;not a word he replied,<br>
    But turned to the girl who knelt down by his side.<br>

  <p>Watty lounges in his arm-chair, in its old accustomed place,<br>

    just the same.</p>

    To prepare our sinful, straying, erring souls for Kingdom Come;<br>

    And scarcely paused a moment&rsquo;s time the mournful news to leave;<br>
    He rode by lonely huts and farms, and when the day was done<br>
    He turned his panting horse&rsquo;s head and rode to Ross&rsquo;s Run.<br>
    No bushman in a single day had ridden half so far<br>
    Since Johnson brought the doctor to his wife at Talbragar.</p>

  <p>That night he passed the humpies of the splitters on the ridge,<br>
    And roused the bullock-drivers camped at Belinfante&rsquo;s Bridge;<br>
    And as he climbed the ridge again the moon shone on the rise;<br>
    The soft white moonbeams glistened in the tears that filled his eyes;<br>

    But &rsquo;twas his best and truest friend who died on Talbragar.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Blackman&rsquo;s Run<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll up at Talbragar!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>At all the shanties round the place they&rsquo;d heard his horse&rsquo;s
    tramp,<br>
    He took the track to Wilson&rsquo;s Luck, and told the diggers&rsquo; camp;<br>
    But in the gorge by Deadman&rsquo;s Gap the mountain shades were black,<br>
    And there a newly-fallen tree was lying on the track&mdash;<br>
    He saw too late, and then he heard the swift hoof&rsquo;s sudden jar,<br>
    And big Ben Duggan ne&rsquo;er again rode home to Talbragar.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The wretch is drunk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Denver&rsquo;s dead&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burning shame!&rsquo; the people said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next day at Talbragar.</p>
  <p>For thirty miles round Talbragar the boys rolled up in strength,<br>
    And Denver had a funeral a good long mile in length;<br>
    Round Denver&rsquo;s grave that Christmas day rough bushmen&rsquo;s eyes
    were dim&mdash;<br>
    The western bushmen knew the way to bury dead like him;<br>
    But some returning homeward found, by light of moon and star,<br>
    Ben Duggan dying in the rocks, five miles from Talbragar.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They knelt around,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faintly gasped, &lsquo;Jack Denver&rsquo;s dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll up at Talbragar!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But one short hour before he died he woke to understand,<br>
    They told him, when he asked them, that the funeral was &lsquo;grand&rsquo;;<br>
    And then there came into his eyes a strange victorious light,<br>
    He smiled on them in triumph, and his great soul took its flight.<br>
    And still the careless bushmen tell by tent and shanty bar<br>
    How Duggan raised a funeral years back on Talbragar.</p>

    And the better part of a people&rsquo;s life in the storm comes uppermost.</p>

    The nations rise in a war, to rot in a peace that lasts too long.<br>

    An&rsquo; we soon run short of tucker an&rsquo; terbacca, which was bad,<br>
    An&rsquo; pertaters dipped in honey was the only tuck we had.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; half our bullicks perished when the drought was on the land,<br>
    An&rsquo; the burnin&rsquo; heat that dazzles as it dances on the sand;<br>
    When the sun-baked clay an&rsquo; gravel paves for miles the burnin&rsquo; creeks,<br>
    An&rsquo; at ev&rsquo;ry step yer travel there a rottin&rsquo; carcase reeks&mdash;<br>
    But we pulled ourselves together, for we never used ter know<br>
    What a feather bed was good for in those days o&rsquo; long ago.</p>
  <p>But in spite ov barren ridges an&rsquo; in spite ov mud an&rsquo; heat,<br>
    An&rsquo; dust that browned the bushes when it rose from bullicks&rsquo; feet,<br>

    An&rsquo; in spite of muddy water where the burnin&rsquo; plain was crossed,<br>
    An&rsquo; in spite of modern progress, and in spite of all their blow,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a better land to live in, in the days o&rsquo; long ago.</p>
  <p>When the frosty moon was shinin&rsquo; o&rsquo;er the ranges like a lamp,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleep upon me comes,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are humpin&rsquo; of our drums.</p>
  <p>I mind the time when first I came<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger to the land;<br>
    And I was stumped, an&rsquo; sick, an&rsquo; lame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bill took me in hand.<br>
    Old Bill was what a chap would call<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend in poverty,<br>
    And he was very kind to all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very good to me.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;d camp beneath the lonely trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit beside the blaze,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-smokin&rsquo; of our clays.<br>
    Or when we&rsquo;d journeyed damp an&rsquo; far,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; clouds were in the skies,<br>
    We&rsquo;d camp in some old shanty bar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit a-tellin&rsquo; lies.</p>
  <p>Though time had writ upon his brow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rubbed away his curls,<br>
    He always was&mdash;an&rsquo; may be now&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A favourite with the girls;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve heard bush-wimmin scream an&rsquo; squall&mdash;<br>

    They could not do their work at all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Corny Bill.</p>
  <p>He was the jolliest old pup<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever you did see,<br>
    And often at some bush kick-up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;d make old Bill M.C.<br>
    He&rsquo;d make them dance and sing all night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d make the music hum,<br>
    But he&rsquo;d be gone at mornin&rsquo; light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-humpin&rsquo; of his drum.</p>
  <p>Though joys of which the poet rhymes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not for Bill an&rsquo; me,<br>
    I think we had some good old times<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out on the wallaby.<br>
    I took a wife and left off rum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; camped beneath a roof;<br>
    But Bill preferred to hump his drum<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-paddin&rsquo; of the hoof.</p>
  <p>The lazy, idle loafers what<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In toney houses camp<br>
    Would call old Bill a drunken sot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loafer, or a tramp;<br>
    But if the dead should ever dance&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As poets say they will&mdash;<br>
    I think I&rsquo;d rather take my chance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along of Corny Bill.</p>
  <p>His long life&rsquo;s-day is nearly o&rsquo;er,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its shades begin to fall;<br>
    He soon must mount his bluey for<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last long tramp of all;<br>
    I trust that when, in bush an&rsquo; town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s lived and learnt his fill,<br>

    When never a fire could we light on the camp,<br>
    And, weary and footsore and drenched to the skin,<br>
    We tramped through the darkness to Cherry-tree Inn?</p>
  <p>Then I had a sweetheart and you had a wife,<br>
    And Johnny was more to his mother than life;<br>
    But we solemnly swore, ere that evening was done,<br>
    That we&rsquo;d never return till our fortunes were won.<br>
    Next morning to harvests of folly and sin<br>

    Drinking beer and lemon-squashes, taking baths and cooling down.</p>

    With their everlasting fences stretching out across the land!<br>
    Desolation where the crow is! Desert where the eagle flies,<br>
    Paddocks where the luny bullock starts and stares with reddened eyes;<br>
    Where, in clouds of dust enveloped, roasted bullock-drivers creep<br>
    Slowly past the sun-dried shepherd dragged behind his crawling sheep.<br>
    Stunted peak of granite gleaming, glaring like a molten mass<br>
    Turned from some infernal furnace on a plain devoid of grass.</p>
  <p>Miles and miles of thirsty gutters&mdash;strings of muddy water-holes<br>
    In the place of &lsquo;shining rivers&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;walled by cliffs
    and forest boles.&rsquo;<br>
    Barren ridges, gullies, ridges! where the ever-madd&rsquo;ning flies&mdash;<br>
    Fiercer than the plagues of Egypt&mdash;swarm about your blighted eyes!<br>
    Bush! where there is no horizon! where the buried bushman sees<br>
    Nothing&mdash;Nothing! but the sameness of the ragged, stunted trees!<br>
    Lonely hut where drought&rsquo;s eternal, suffocating atmosphere<br>
    Where the God-forgotten hatter dreams of city life and beer.</p>
  <p>Treacherous tracks that trap the stranger, endless roads that gleam and
    glare,<br>
    Dark and evil-looking gullies, hiding secrets here and there!<br>
    Dull dumb flats and stony rises, where the toiling bullocks bake,<br>
    And the sinister &lsquo;gohanna&rsquo;, and the lizard, and the snake.<br>
    Land of day and night&mdash;no morning freshness, and no afternoon,<br>
    When the great white sun in rising bringeth summer heat in June.<br>
    Dismal country for the exile, when the shades begin to fall<br>
    From the sad heart-breaking sunset, to the new-chum worst of all.</p>
  <p>Dreary land in rainy weather, with the endless clouds that drift<br>
    O&rsquo;er the bushman like a blanket that the Lord will never lift&mdash;<br>
    Dismal land when it is raining&mdash;growl of floods, and, oh! the woosh<br>
    Of the rain and wind together on the dark bed of the bush&mdash;<br>
    Ghastly fires in lonely humpies where the granite rocks are piled<br>
    In the rain-swept wildernesses that are wildest of the wild.</p>

    Home of tragedy applauded by the dingoes&rsquo; dismal yell,<br>
    Heaven of the shanty-keeper&mdash;fitting fiend for such a hell&mdash;<br>

    The rising moon&rsquo;s great placid face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks gravely o&rsquo;er the ledges.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheCityBushman"></a>The City Bushman</b></h2>
  <p>It was&nbsp;pleasant up the country, City Bushman, where you went,<br>
    For you sought the greener patches and you travelled like a gent;<br>
    And you curse the trams and buses and the turmoil and the push,<br>
    Though you know the squalid city needn&rsquo;t keep you from the bush;<br>
    But we lately heard you singing of the &lsquo;plains where shade is not&rsquo;,<br>
    And you mentioned it was dusty&mdash;&lsquo;all was dry and all was hot&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>True, the bush &lsquo;hath moods and changes&rsquo;&mdash;and the bushman
    hath &rsquo;em, too,<br>
    For he&rsquo;s not a poet&rsquo;s dummy&mdash;he&rsquo;s a man, the same
    as you;<br>
    But his back is growing rounder&mdash;slaving for the absentee&mdash;<br>
    And his toiling wife is thinner than a country wife should be.<br>
    For we noticed that the faces of the folks we chanced to meet<br>
    Should have made a greater contrast to the faces in the street;<br>
    And, in short, we think the bushman&rsquo;s being driven to the wall,<br>
    And it&rsquo;s doubtful if his spirit will be &lsquo;loyal thro&rsquo; it
    all&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>Though the bush has been romantic and it&rsquo;s nice to sing about,<br>
    There&rsquo;s a lot of patriotism that the land could do without&mdash;<br>
    Sort of&nbsp;<i>british workman</i>&nbsp;nonsense that shall perish in the
    scorn<br>
    Of the drover who is driven and the shearer who is shorn,<br>
    Of the struggling western farmers who have little time for rest,<br>
    And are ruined on selections in the sheep-infested West;<br>
    Droving songs are very pretty, but they merit little thanks<br>
    From the people of a country in possession of the Banks.</p>
  <p>And the &lsquo;rise and fall of seasons&rsquo; suits the rise and fall of
    rhyme,<br>
    But we know that western seasons do not run on schedule time;<br>
    For the drought will go on drying while there&rsquo;s anything to dry,<br>
    Then it rains until you&rsquo;d fancy it would bleach the sunny sky&mdash;<br>
    Then it pelters out of reason, for the downpour day and night<br>
    Nearly sweeps the population to the Great Australian Bight.<br>
    It is up in Northern Queensland that the seasons do their best,<br>
    But it&rsquo;s doubtful if you ever saw a season in the West;<br>
    There are years without an autumn or a winter or a spring,<br>
    There are broiling Junes, and summers when it rains like anything.</p>
  <p>In the bush my ears were opened to the singing of the bird,<br>
    But the &lsquo;carol of the magpie&rsquo; was a thing I never heard.<br>
    Once the beggar roused my slumbers in a shanty, it is true,<br>
    But I only heard him asking, &lsquo;Who the blanky blank are you?&rsquo;<br>
    And the bell-bird in the ranges&mdash;but his &lsquo;silver chime&rsquo; is
    harsh<br>
    When it&rsquo;s heard beside the solo of the curlew in the marsh.</p>
  <p>Yes, I heard the shearers singing &lsquo;William Riley&rsquo;, out of tune,<br>
    Saw &rsquo;em fighting round a shanty on a Sunday afternoon,<br>
    But the bushman isn&rsquo;t always &lsquo;trapping brumbies in the night&rsquo;,<br>
    Nor is he for ever riding when &lsquo;the morn is fresh and bright&rsquo;,<br>
    And he isn&rsquo;t always singing in the humpies on the run&mdash;<br>
    And the camp-fire&rsquo;s &lsquo;cheery blazes&rsquo; are a trifle overdone;<br>
    We have grumbled with the bushmen round the fire on rainy days,<br>
    When the smoke would blind a bullock and there wasn&rsquo;t any blaze,<br>
    Save the blazes of our language, for we cursed the fire in turn<br>
    Till the atmosphere was heated and the wood began to burn.<br>
    Then we had to wring our blueys which were rotting in the swags,<br>
    And we saw the sugar leaking through the bottoms of the bags,<br>
    And we couldn&rsquo;t raise a chorus, for the toothache and the cramp,<br>
    While we spent the hours of darkness draining puddles round the camp.</p>
  <p>Would you like to change with Clancy&mdash;go a-droving? tell us true,<br>
    For we rather think that Clancy would be glad to change with you,<br>
    And be something in the city; but &rsquo;twould give your muse a shock<br>
    To be losing time and money through the foot-rot in the flock,<br>
    And you wouldn&rsquo;t mind the beauties underneath the starry dome<br>
    If you had a wife and children and a lot of bills at home.</p>
  <p>Did you ever guard the cattle when the night was inky-black,<br>
    And it rained, and icy water trickled gently down your back<br>
    Till your saddle-weary backbone fell a-aching to the roots<br>
    And you almost felt the croaking of the bull-frog in your boots&mdash;<br>
    Sit and shiver in the saddle, curse the restless stock and cough<br>
    Till a squatter&rsquo;s irate dummy cantered up to warn you off?<br>
    Did you fight the drought and pleuro when the &lsquo;seasons&rsquo; were
    asleep,<br>
    Felling sheoaks all the morning for a flock of starving sheep,<br>
    Drinking mud instead of water&mdash;climbing trees and lopping boughs<br>
    For the broken-hearted bullocks and the dry and dusty cows?</p>
  <p>Do you think the bush was better in the &lsquo;good old droving days&rsquo;,<br>
    When the squatter ruled supremely as the king of western ways,<br>
    When you got a slip of paper for the little you could earn,<br>
    But were forced to take provisions from the station in return&mdash;<br>
    When you couldn&rsquo;t keep a chicken at your humpy on the run,<br>
    For the squatter wouldn&rsquo;t let you&mdash;and your work was never done;<br>
    When you had to leave the missus in a lonely hut forlorn<br>
    While you &lsquo;rose up Willy Riley&rsquo;&mdash;in the days ere you were
    born?</p>
  <p>Ah! we read about the drovers and the shearers and the like<br>
    Till we wonder why such happy and romantic fellows strike.<br>
    Don&rsquo;t you fancy that the poets ought to give the bush a rest<br>
    Ere they raise a just rebellion in the over-written West?<br>
    Where the simple-minded bushman gets a meal and bed and rum<br>
    Just by riding round reporting phantom flocks that never come;<br>
    Where the scalper&mdash;never troubled by the &lsquo;war-whoop of the push&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    Has a quiet little billet&mdash;breeding rabbits in the bush;<br>
    Where the idle shanty-keeper never fails to make a draw,<br>
    And the dummy gets his tucker through provisions in the law;<br>
    Where the labour-agitator&mdash;when the shearers rise in might&mdash;<br>
    Makes his money sacrificing all his substance for The Right;<br>
    Where the squatter makes his fortune, and &lsquo;the seasons rise and fall&rsquo;,<br>
    And the poor and honest bushman has to suffer for it all;<br>
    Where the drovers and the shearers and the bushmen and the rest<br>
    Never reach the Eldorado of the poets of the West.</p>
  <p>And you think the bush is purer and that life is better there,<br>
    But it doesn&rsquo;t seem to pay you like the &lsquo;squalid street and square&rsquo;.<br>
    Pray inform us, City Bushman, where you read, in prose or verse,<br>
    Of the awful &lsquo;city urchin who would greet you with a curse&rsquo;.<br>
    There are golden hearts in gutters, though their owners lack the fat,<br>
    And we&rsquo;ll back a teamster&rsquo;s offspring to outswear a city brat.<br>
    Do you think we&rsquo;re never jolly where the trams and buses rage?<br>
    Did you hear the gods in chorus when &lsquo;Ri-tooral&rsquo; held the stage?<br>
    Did you catch a ring of sorrow in the city urchin&rsquo;s voice<br>
    When he yelled for Billy Elton, when he thumped the floor for Royce?<br>
    Do the bushmen, down on pleasure, miss the everlasting stars<br>
    When they drink and flirt and so on in the glow of private bars?</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ve a down on &lsquo;trams and buses&rsquo;, or the &lsquo;roar&rsquo; of &rsquo;em,
    you said,<br>
    And the &lsquo;filthy, dirty attic&rsquo;, where you never toiled for bread.<br>
    (And about that self-same attic&mdash;Lord! wherever have you been?<br>
    For the struggling needlewoman mostly keeps her attic clean.)<br>
    But you&rsquo;ll find it very jolly with the cuff-and-collar push,<br>
    And the city seems to suit you, while you rave about the bush.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ll admit that Up-the Country, more especially in drought,<br>
    Isn&rsquo;t quite the Eldorado that the poets rave about,<br>
    Yet at times we long to gallop where the reckless bushman rides<br>
    In the wake of startled brumbies that are flying for their hides;<br>
    Long to feel the saddle tremble once again between our knees<br>
    And to hear the stockwhips rattle just like rifles in the trees!<br>
    Long to feel the bridle-leather tugging strongly in the hand<br>
    And to feel once more a little like a native of the land.<br>
    And the ring of bitter feeling in the jingling of our rhymes<br>
    Isn&rsquo;t suited to the country nor the spirit of the times.<br>
    Let us go together droving, and returning, if we live,<br>
    Try to understand each other while we reckon up the div.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Eurunderee"></a>Eurunderee</b></h2>
  <p>There&nbsp;are scenes in the distance where beauty is not,<br>
    On the desolate flats where gaunt appletrees rot.<br>
    Where the brooding old ridge rises up to the breeze<br>
    From his dark lonely gullies of stringy-bark trees,<br>
    There are voice-haunted gaps, ever sullen and strange,<br>
    But Eurunderee lies like a gem in the range.</p>
  <p>Still I see in my fancy the dark-green and blue<br>
    Of the box-covered hills where the five-corners grew;<br>
    And the rugged old sheoaks that sighed in the bend<br>
    O&rsquo;er the lily-decked pools where the dark ridges end,<br>
    And the scrub-covered spurs running down from the Peak<br>
    To the deep grassy banks of Eurunderee Creek.</p>
  <p>On the knolls where the vineyards and fruit-gardens are<br>
    There&rsquo;s a beauty that even the drought cannot mar;<br>
    For I noticed it oft, in the days that are lost,<br>
    As I trod on the siding where lingered the frost,<br>
    When the shadows of night from the gullies were gone<br>
    And the hills in the background were flushed by the dawn.</p>
  <p>I was there in late years, but there&rsquo;s many a change<br>
    Where the Cudgegong River flows down through the range,<br>
    For the curse of the town with the railroad had come,<br>
    And the goldfields were dead. And the girl and the chum<br>
    And the old home were gone, yet the oaks seemed to speak<br>
    Of the hazy old days on Eurunderee Creek.</p>
  <p>And I stood by that creek, ere the sunset grew cold,<br>
    When the leaves of the sheoaks are traced on the gold,<br>
    And I thought of old things, and I thought of old folks,<br>
    Till I sighed in my heart to the sigh of the oaks;<br>
    For the years waste away like the waters that leak<br>
    Through the pebbles and sand of Eurunderee Creek.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MountBukaroo"></a>Mount Bukaroo</b></h2>
  <p>Only one&nbsp;old post is standing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solid yet, but only one&mdash;<br>
    Where the milking, and the branding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the slaughtering were done.<br>
    Later years have brought dejection,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care, and sorrow; but we knew<br>
    Happy days on that selection<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath old Bukaroo.</p>
  <p>Then the light of day commencing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found us at the gully&rsquo;s head,<br>
    Splitting timber for the fencing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripping bark to roof the shed.<br>
    Hands and hearts the labour strengthened;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weariness we never knew,<br>
    Even when the shadows lengthened<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the base of Bukaroo.</p>
  <p>There for days below the paddock<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the wilderness would yield<br>
    To the spade, and pick, and mattock,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we toiled to win the field.<br>
    Bronzed hands we used to sully<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they were of darkest hue,<br>
  &lsquo;Burning off&rsquo; down in the gully<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the back of Bukaroo.</p>
  <p>When we came the baby brother<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left in haste his broken toys,<br>
    Shouted to the busy mother:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Here is dadda and the boys!&rsquo;<br>
    Strange it seems that she was able<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the work that she would do;<br>
    How she&rsquo;d bustle round the table<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hut &rsquo;neath Bukaroo!</p>
  <p>When the cows were safely yarded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the calves were in the pen,<br>
    All the cares of day discarded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed we round the hut-fire then.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the flames o&rsquo;er-topped the flue;<br>
    Happy days remembered after&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far away from Bukaroo.</p>
  <p>But the years were full of changes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a sorrow found us there;<br>
    For our home amid the ranges<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not safe from searching Care.<br>
    On he came, a silent creeper;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another mountain threw<br>
    O&rsquo;er our lives a shadow deeper<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the shade of Bukaroo.</p>
  <p>All the farm is disappearing;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the home has vanished now,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid the furrows of the plough.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the little garden grew;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of Bukaroo.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheFireatRosssFarm"></a>The Fire at Ross&rsquo;s Farm</b></h2>
  <p>The squatter&nbsp;saw his pastures wide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decrease, as one by one<br>
    The farmers moving to the west<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected on his run;<br>
    Selectors took the water up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the black soil round;<br>
    The best grass-land the squatter had<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was spoilt by Ross&rsquo;s Ground.</p>
  <p>Now many schemes to shift old Ross<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had racked the squatter&rsquo;s brains,<br>
    But Sandy had the stubborn blood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Scotland in his veins;<br>
    He held the land and fenced it in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared and ploughed the soil,<br>
    And year by year a richer crop<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repaid him for his toil.</p>
  <p>Between the homes for many years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil left his tracks:<br>
    The squatter pounded Ross&rsquo;s stock,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sandy pounded Black&rsquo;s.<br>
    A well upon the lower run<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was filled with earth and logs,<br>
    And Black laid baits about the farm<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To poison Ross&rsquo;s dogs.</p>
  <p>It was, indeed, a deadly feud<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of class and creed and race;<br>
    But, yet, there was a Romeo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a Juliet in the case;<br>
    And more than once across the flats,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the Southern Cross,<br>
    Young Robert Black was seen to ride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pretty Jenny Ross.</p>
  <p>One Christmas time, when months of drought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had parched the western creeks,<br>
    The bush-fires started in the north<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And travelled south for weeks.<br>
    At night along the river-side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene was grand and strange&mdash;<br>
    The hill-fires looked like lighted streets<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cities in the range.</p>
  <p>The cattle-tracks between the trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were like long dusky aisles,<br>
    And on a sudden breeze the fire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would sweep along for miles;<br>
    Like sounds of distant musketry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It crackled through the brakes,<br>
    And o&rsquo;er the flat of silver grass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hissed like angry snakes.</p>
  <p>It leapt across the flowing streams<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And raced o&rsquo;er pastures broad;<br>
    It climbed the trees and lit the boughs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the scrubs it roared.<br>
    The bees fell stifled in the smoke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perished in their hives,<br>
    And with the stock the kangaroos<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went flying for their lives.</p>
  <p>The sun had set on Christmas Eve,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, through the scrub-lands wide,<br>
    Young Robert Black came riding home<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As only natives ride.<br>
    He galloped to the homestead door<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave the first alarm:<br>
  &lsquo;The fire is past the granite spur,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And close to Ross&rsquo;s farm.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, father, send the men at once,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They won&rsquo;t be wanted here;<br>
    Poor Ross&rsquo;s wheat is all he has<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pull him through the year.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Then let it burn,&rsquo; the squatter said;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to see it done&mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;d bless the fire if it would clear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selectors from the run.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go if you will,&rsquo; the squatter said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;You shall not take the men&mdash;<br>
    Go out and join your precious friends,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And don&rsquo;t come here again.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t come back,&rsquo; young Robert cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, reckless in his ire,<br>
    He sharply turned his horse&rsquo;s head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And galloped towards the fire.</p>
  <p>And there, for three long weary hours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-blind with smoke and heat,<br>
    Old Ross and Robert fought the flames<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That neared the ripened wheat.<br>
    The farmer&rsquo;s hand was nerved by fears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of danger and of loss;<br>
    And Robert fought the stubborn foe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the love of Jenny Ross.</p>
  <p>But serpent-like the curves and lines<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slipped past them, and between,<br>
    Until they reached the bound&rsquo;ry where<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old coach-road had been.<br>
  &lsquo;The track is now our only hope,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we must stand,&rsquo; cried Ross,<br>
  &lsquo;For nought on earth can stop the fire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If once it gets across.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then came a cruel gust of wind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with a fiendish rush,<br>
    The flames leapt o&rsquo;er the narrow path<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lit the fence of brush.<br>
  &lsquo;The crop must burn!&rsquo; the farmer cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;We cannot save it now,&rsquo;<br>
    And down upon the blackened ground<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dashed the ragged bough.</p>
  <p>But wildly, in a rush of hope,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart began to beat,<br>
    For o&rsquo;er the crackling fire he heard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of horses&rsquo; feet.<br>
  &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s help at last,&rsquo; young Robert cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even as he spoke<br>
    The squatter with a dozen men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came racing through the smoke.</p>
  <p>Down on the ground the stockmen jumped<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bared each brawny arm,<br>
    They tore green branches from the trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fought for Ross&rsquo;s farm;<br>
    And when before the gallant band<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beaten flames gave way,<br>
    Two grimy hands in friendship joined&mdash;<br>

    The first one was signed by an Elder, the other by Cameron&rsquo;s aunt.<br>
    The meenister called him &rsquo;ungodly&mdash;a stray frae the fauld o&rsquo; the
    Lord&rsquo;,<br>
    And his aunt set him down as a spendthrift, &lsquo;a rebel at hame and abroad&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>He got drunk now and then and he gambled (such heroes are often the same);<br>
    That&rsquo;s all they could say in connection with Alister Cameron&rsquo;s
    name.<br>
    He was straight and he stuck to his country and spoke with respect of his
    kirk;<br>
    He did his full share of the cooking, and more than his share of the work.<br>
    And many a poor devil then, when his strength and his money were spent,<br>
    Was sure of a lecture&mdash;and tucker, and a shakedown in Cameron&rsquo;s
    tent.</p>
  <p>He shunned all the girls in the camp, and they said he was proof to the
    dart&mdash;<br>
    That nothing but whisky and gaming had ever a place in his heart;<br>
    He carried a packet about him, well hid, but I saw it at last,<br>
    And&mdash;well, &rsquo;tis a very old story&mdash;the story of Cameron&rsquo;s
    past:<br>
    A ring and a sprig o&rsquo; white heather, a letter or two and a curl,<br>
    A bit of a worn silver chain, and the portrait of Cameron&rsquo;s girl.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>It chanced in the first of the Sixties that Ally and I and McKean<br>
    Were sinking a shaft on Mundoorin, near Fosberry&rsquo;s puddle-machine.<br>
    The bucket we used was a big one, and rather a weight when &rsquo;twas full,<br>
    Though Alister wound it up easy, for he had the strength of a bull.<br>
    He hinted at heart-disease often, but, setting his fancy apart,<br>
    I always believed there was nothing the matter with Cameron&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>One day I was working below&mdash;I was filling the bucket with clay,<br>
    When Alister cried, &lsquo;Pack it on, mon! we ought to be bottomed to-day.&rsquo;<br>
    He wound, and the bucket rose steady and swift to the surface until<br>
    It reached the first log on the top, where it suddenly stopped, and hung
    still.<br>
    I knew what was up in a moment when Cameron shouted to me:<br>
  &lsquo;Climb up for your life by the footholes.&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;ll stick tae
  th&rsquo; haun&rsquo;le&mdash;or dee!</i>&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And those were the last words he uttered. He groaned, for I heard him quite
    plain&mdash;<br>
    There&rsquo;s nothing so awful as that when it&rsquo;s wrung from a workman
    in pain.<br>
    The strength of despair was upon me; I started, and scarcely drew breath,<br>
    But climbed to the top for my life in the fear of a terrible death.<br>
    And there, with his waist on the handle, I saw the dead form of my mate,<br>
    And over the shaft hung the bucket, suspended by Cameron&rsquo;s weight.</p>
  <p>I wonder did Alister think of the scenes in the distance so dim,<br>
    When Death at the windlass that morning took cruel advantage of him?<br>
    He knew if the bucket rushed down it would murder or cripple his mate&mdash;<br>
    His hand on the iron was closed with a grip that was stronger than Fate;<br>
    He thought of my danger, not his, when he felt in his bosom the smart,<br>
    And stuck to the handle in spite of the Finger of Death on his heart.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SinceThen"></a>Since Then</b></h2>
  <p>I&nbsp;met&nbsp;Jack Ellis in town to-day&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Ellis&mdash;my old mate, Jack&mdash;<br>
    Ten years ago, from the Castlereagh,<br>
    We carried our swags together away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Never-Again, Out Back.</p>
  <p>But times have altered since those old days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the times have changed the men.<br>
    Ah, well! there&rsquo;s little to blame or praise&mdash;<br>
    Jack Ellis and I have tramped long ways<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On different tracks since then.</p>
  <p>His hat was battered, his coat was green,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toes of his boots were through,<br>
    But the pride was his! It was I felt mean&mdash;<br>
    I wished that my collar was not so clean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the clothes I wore so new.</p>
  <p>He saw me first, and he knew &rsquo;twas I&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holiday swell he met.<br>
    Why have we no faith in each other? Ah, why?&mdash;<br>
    He made as though he would pass me by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he thought that I might forget.</p>
  <p>He ought to have known me better than that,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the tracks we tramped far out&mdash;<br>
    The sweltering scrub and the blazing flat,<br>
    When the heat came down through each old felt hat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hell-born western drought.</p>
  <p>The cheques we made and the shanty sprees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camps in the great blind scrub,<br>
    The long wet tramps when the plains were seas,<br>
    And the oracles worked in days like these<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rum and tobacco and grub.</p>
  <p>Could I forget how we struck &lsquo;the same<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old tale&rsquo; in the nearer West,<br>
    When the first great test of our friendship came&mdash;<br>
    But&mdash;well, there&rsquo;s little to praise or blame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our mateship stood the test.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Heads!&rsquo; he laughed (but his face was stern)&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Tails!&rsquo; and a friendly oath;<br>
    We loved her fair, we had much to learn&mdash;<br>
    And each was stabbed to the heart in turn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the girl who&mdash;loved us both.</p>
  <p>Or the last day lost on the lignum plain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I staggered, half-blind, half-dead,<br>
    With a burning throat and a tortured brain;<br>
    And the tank when we came to the track again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was seventeen miles ahead.</p>
  <p>Then life seemed finished&mdash;then death began<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As down in the dust I sank,<br>
    But he stuck to his mate as a bushman can,<br>
    Till I heard him saying, &lsquo;Bear up, old man!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shade by the mulga tank.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>He took my hand in a distant way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I thought how we parted last),<br>
    And we seemed like men who have nought to say<br>
    And who meet&mdash;&lsquo;Good-day&rsquo;, and who part&mdash;&lsquo;Good-day&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who never have shared the past.</p>
  <p>I asked him in for a drink with me&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Ellis&mdash;my old mate, Jack&mdash;<br>
    But his manner no longer was careless and free,<br>
    He followed, but not with the grin that he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wore always in days Out Back.</p>
  <p>I tried to live in the past once more&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the present and past combine,<br>
    But the days between I could not ignore&mdash;<br>
    I couldn&rsquo;t help notice the clothes he wore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he couldn&rsquo;t but notice mine.</p>
  <p>He placed his glass on the polished bar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he wouldn&rsquo;t fill up again;<br>
    For he is prouder than most men are&mdash;<br>
    Jack Ellis and I have tramped too far<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On different tracks since then.</p>
  <p>He said that he had a mate to meet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see you again,&rsquo; said he,<br>
    Then he hurried away through the crowded street<br>
    And the rattle of buses and scrape of feet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed suddenly loud to me.</p>
  <p>And I almost wished that the time were come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When less will be left to Fate&mdash;<br>
    When boys will start on the track from home<br>
    With equal chances, and no old chum<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have more or less than his mate.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="PeterAndersonandCo"></a>Peter Anderson and Co.</b></h2>
  <p>He had&nbsp;offices in Sydney, not so many years ago,<br>
    And his shingle bore the legend &lsquo;Peter Anderson and Co.&rsquo;,<br>
    But his real name was Careless, as the fellows understood&mdash;<br>
    And his relatives decided that he wasn&rsquo;t any good.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas their gentle tongues that blasted any &lsquo;character&rsquo; he
  had&mdash;<br>
    He was fond of beer and leisure&mdash;and the Co. was just as bad.<br>
    It was limited in number to a unit, was the Co.&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a bosom chum of Peter and his Christian name was Joe.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis a class of men belonging to these soul-forsaken years:<br>
    Third-rate canvassers, collectors, journalists and auctioneers.<br>
    They are never very shabby, they are never very spruce&mdash;<br>
    Going cheerfully and carelessly and smoothly to the deuce.<br>
    Some are wanderers by profession, &lsquo;turning up&rsquo; and gone as soon,<br>
    Travelling second-class, or steerage (when it&rsquo;s cheap they go saloon);<br>
    Free from &lsquo;ists&rsquo; and &lsquo;isms&rsquo;, troubled little by belief
    or doubt&mdash;<br>
    Lazy, purposeless, and useless&mdash;knocking round and hanging out.<br>
    They will take what they can get, and they will give what they can give,<br>
    God alone knows how they manage&mdash;God alone knows how they live!<br>
    They are nearly always hard-up, but are cheerful all the while&mdash;<br>
    Men whose energy and trousers wear out sooner than their smile!<br>
    They, no doubt, like us, are haunted by the boresome &lsquo;if&rsquo; or &lsquo;might&rsquo;,<br>
    But their ghosts are ghosts of daylight&mdash;they are men who live at night!</p>
  <p>Peter met you with the comic smile of one who knows you well,<br>
    And is mighty glad to see you, and has got a joke to tell;<br>
    He could laugh when all was gloomy, he could grin when all was blue,<br>
    Sing a comic song and act it, and appreciate it, too.<br>
    Only cynical in cases where his own self was the jest,<br>
    And the humour of his good yarns made atonement for the rest.<br>
    Seldom serious&mdash;doing business just as &rsquo;twere a friendly game&mdash;<br>
    Cards or billiards&mdash;nothing graver. And the Co. was much the same.</p>
  <p>They tried everything and nothing &rsquo;twixt the shovel and the press,<br>
    And were more or less successful in their ventures&mdash;mostly less.<br>
    Once they ran a country paper till the plant was seized for debt,<br>
    And the local sinners chuckle over dingy copies yet.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;d been through it all and knew it in the land of Bills and Jims&mdash;<br>
    Using Peter&rsquo;s own expression, they had been in &lsquo;various swims&rsquo;.<br>
    Now and then they&rsquo;d take an office, as they called it,&mdash;make a
    dash<br>
    Into business life as &lsquo;agents&rsquo;&mdash;something not requiring
    cash.<br>
    (You can always furnish cheaply, when your cash or credit fails,<br>
    With a packing-case, a hammer, and a pound of two-inch nails&mdash;<br>
    And, maybe, a drop of varnish and sienna, too, for tints,<br>
    And a scrap or two of oilcloth, and a yard or two of chintz).<br>
    They would pull themselves together, pay a week&rsquo;s rent in advance,<br>
    But it never lasted longer than a month by any chance.</p>
  <p>The office was their haven, for they lived there when hard-up&mdash;<br>
    A &lsquo;daily&rsquo; for a table cloth&mdash;a jam tin for a cup;<br>
    And if the landlord&rsquo;s bailiff happened round in times like these<br>
    And seized the office-fittings&mdash;well, there wasn&rsquo;t much to seize&mdash;<br>
    They would leave him in possession. But at other times they shot<br>
    The moon, and took an office where the landlord knew them not.<br>
    And when morning brought the bailiff there&rsquo;d be nothing to be seen<br>
    Save a piece of bevelled cedar where the tenant&rsquo;s plate had been;<br>
    There would be no sign of Peter&mdash;there would be no sign of Joe<br>
    Till another portal boasted &lsquo;Peter Anderson and Co.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And when times were locomotive, billiard-rooms and private bars&mdash;<br>
    Spicy parties at the cafe&mdash;long cab-drives beneath the stars;<br>
    Private picnics down the Harbour&mdash;shady campings-out, you know&mdash;<br>
    No one would have dreamed &rsquo;twas Peter&mdash;no one would have thought &rsquo;twas
    Joe!<br>
    Free-and-easies in their &lsquo;diggings&rsquo;, when the funds began to
    fail,<br>
    Bosom chums, cigars, tobacco, and a case of English ale&mdash;<br>
    Gloriously drunk and happy, till they heard the roosters crow&mdash;<br>
    And the landlady and neighbours made complaints about the Co.<br>
    But that life! it might be likened to a reckless drinking-song,<br>
    For it can&rsquo;t go on for ever, and it never lasted long.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Debt-collecting ruined Peter&mdash;people talked him round too oft,<br>
    For his heart was soft as butter (and the Co.&rsquo;s was just as soft);<br>
    He would cheer the haggard missus, and he&rsquo;d tell her not to fret,<br>
    And he&rsquo;d ask the worried debtor round with him to have a wet;<br>
    He would ask him round the corner, and it seemed to him and her,<br>
    After each of Peter&rsquo;s visits, things were brighter than they were.<br>
    But, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t business&mdash;only Peter&rsquo;s careless
    way;<br>
    And perhaps it pays in heaven, but on earth it doesn&rsquo;t pay.<br>
    They got harder up than ever, and, to make it worse, the Co.<br>
    Went more often round the corner than was good for him to go.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I might live,&rsquo; he said to Peter, &lsquo;but I haven&rsquo;t
    got the nerve&mdash;<br>
    I am going, Peter, going&mdash;going, going&mdash;no reserve.<br>
    Eat and drink and love they tell us, for to-morrow we may die,<br>
    Buy experience&mdash;and we bought it&mdash;we&rsquo;re experienced, you
    and I.&rsquo;<br>
    Then, with a weary movement of his hand across his brow:<br>
  &lsquo;The death of such philosophy&rsquo;s the death I&rsquo;m dying now.<br>
    Pull yourself together, Peter; &rsquo;Tis the dying wish of Joe<br>
    That the business world shall honour Peter Anderson and Co.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When you feel your life is sinking in a dull and useless course,<br>
    And begin to find in drinking keener pleasure and remorse&mdash;<br>
    When you feel the love of leisure on your careless heart take holt,<br>
    Break away from friends and pleasure, though it give your heart a jolt.<br>
    Shun the poison breath of cities&mdash;billiard-rooms and private bars,<br>
    Go where you can breathe God&rsquo;s air and see the grandeur of the stars!<br>
    Find again and follow up the old ambitions that you had&mdash;<br>
    See if you can raise a drink, old man, I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; mighty bad&mdash;<br>
    Hot and sweetened, nip o&rsquo; butter&mdash;squeeze o&rsquo; lemon, Pete,&rsquo; he
    sighed.<br>
    And, while Peter went to fetch it, Joseph went to sleep&mdash;and died<br>
    With a smile&mdash;anticipation, maybe, of the peace to come,<br>
    Or a joke to try on Peter&mdash;or, perhaps, it was the rum.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Peter staggered, gripped the table, swerved as some old drunkard swerves&mdash;<br>
    At a gulp he drank the toddy, just to brace his shattered nerves.<br>
    It was awful, if you like. But then he hadn&rsquo;t time to think&mdash;<br>
    All is nothing! Nothing matters! Fill your glasses&mdash;dead man&rsquo;s
    drink.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Yet, to show his heart was not of human decency bereft,<br>
    Peter paid the undertaker. He got drunk on what was left;<br>
    Then he shed some tears, half-maudlin, on the grave where lay the Co.,<br>
    And he drifted to a township where the city failures go.<br>
    Where, though haunted by the man he was, the wreck he yet might be,<br>
    Or the man he might have been, or by each spectre of the three,<br>
    And the dying words of Joseph, ringing through his own despair,<br>
    Peter &lsquo;pulled himself together&rsquo; and he started business there.</p>
  <p>But his life was very lonely, and his heart was very sad,<br>
    And no help to reformation was the company he had&mdash;<br>
    Men who might have been, who had been, but who were not in the swim&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a town of wrecks and failures&mdash;they appreciated him.<br>
    They would ask him who the Co. was&mdash;that queer company he kept&mdash;<br>
    And he&rsquo;d always answer vaguely&mdash;he would say his partner slept;<br>
    That he had a &lsquo;sleeping partner&rsquo;&mdash;jesting while his spirit
    broke&mdash;<br>
    And they grinned above their glasses, for they took it as a joke.<br>
    He would shout while he had money, he would joke while he had breath&mdash;<br>
    No one seemed to care or notice how he drank himself to death;<br>
    Till at last there came a morning when his smile was seen no more&mdash;<br>
    He was gone from out the office, and his shingle from the door,<br>
    And a boundary-rider jogging out across the neighb&rsquo;ring run<br>
    Was attracted by a something that was blazing in the sun;<br>
    And he found that it was Peter, lying peacefully at rest,<br>
    With a bottle close beside him and the shingle on his breast.<br>
    Well, they analysed the liquor, and it would appear that he<br>
    Qualified his drink with something good for setting spirits free.<br>
    Though &rsquo;twas plainly self-destruction&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;twas his
    own affair,&rsquo; they said;<br>
    And the jury viewed him sadly, and they found&mdash;that he was dead.</p>

  &lsquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll keep the ould place till the childer come home.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Whenever the scowling old sundowners come,<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheCambarooraStar"></a>The Cambaroora Star</b></h2>
  <p>So&nbsp;you&rsquo;re writing for a paper? Well, it&rsquo;s nothing very
    new<br>
    To be writing yards of drivel for a tidy little screw;<br>
    You are young and educated, and a clever chap you are,<br>
    But you&rsquo;ll never run a paper like the&nbsp;<i>Cambaroora Star</i>.<br>
    Though in point of education I am nothing but a dunce,<br>
    I myself&mdash;you mayn&rsquo;t believe it&mdash;helped to run a paper once<br>
    With a chap on Cambaroora, by the name of Charlie Brown,<br>
    And I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it if you&rsquo;ll take the story down.</p>
  <p>On a golden day in summer, when the sunrays were aslant,<br>
    Brown arrived in Cambaroora with a little printing plant<br>
    And his worldly goods and chattels&mdash;rather damaged on the way&mdash;<br>
    And a weary-looking woman who was following the dray.<br>
    He had bought an empty humpy, and, instead of getting tight,<br>
    Why, the diggers heard him working like a lunatic all night:<br>
    And next day a sign of canvas, writ in characters of tar,<br>
    Claimed the humpy as the office of the&nbsp;<i>Cambaroora Star</i>.</p>
  <p>Well, I cannot read, that&rsquo;s honest, but I had a digger friend<br>
    Who would read the paper to me from the title to the end;<br>
    And the&nbsp;<i>Star</i>&nbsp;contained a leader running thieves and spielers
    down,<br>
    With a slap against claim-jumping, and a poem made by Brown.<br>
    Once I showed it to a critic, and he said &rsquo;twas very fine,<br>
    Though he wasn&rsquo;t long in finding glaring faults in every line;<br>
    But it was a song of Freedom&mdash;all the clever critic said<br>
    Couldn&rsquo;t stop that song from ringing, ringing, ringing in my head.</p>
  <p>So I went where Brown was working in his little hut hard by:<br>
  &lsquo;My old mate has been a-reading of your writings, Brown,&rsquo; said
  I&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I have studied on your leader, I agree with what you say,<br>
    You have struck the bed-rock certain, and there ain&rsquo;t no get-away;<br>
    Your paper&rsquo;s just the thumper for a young and growing land,<br>
    And your principles is honest, Brown; I want to shake your hand,<br>
    And if there&rsquo;s any lumping in connection with the&nbsp;<i>Star</i>,<br>
    Well, I&rsquo;ll find the time to do it, and I&rsquo;ll help you&mdash;there
    you are!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Brown was every inch a digger (bronzed and bearded in the South),<br>
    But there seemed a kind of weakness round the corners of his mouth<br>
    When he took the hand I gave him; and he gripped it like a vice,<br>
    While he tried his best to thank me, and he stuttered once or twice.<br>
    But there wasn&rsquo;t need for talking&mdash;we&rsquo;d the same old loves
    and hates,<br>
    And we understood each other&mdash;Charlie Brown and I were mates.<br>
    So we worked a little &lsquo;paddock&rsquo; on a place they called the &lsquo;Bar&rsquo;,<br>
    And we sank a shaft together, and at night we worked the&nbsp;<i>Star</i>.</p>
  <p>Charlie thought and did his writing when his work was done at night,<br>
    And the missus used to &lsquo;set&rsquo; it near as quick as he could write.<br>
    Well, I didn&rsquo;t shirk my promise, and I helped the thing, I guess,<br>
    For at night I worked the lever of the crazy printing-press;<br>
    Brown himself would do the feeding, and the missus used to &lsquo;fly&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    She is flying with the angels, if there&rsquo;s justice up on high,<br>
    For she died on Cambaroora when the&nbsp;<i>Star</i>&nbsp;began to go,<br>
    And was buried like the diggers buried diggers long ago.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Lord, that press! It was a jumper&mdash;we could seldom get it right,<br>
    And were lucky if we averaged a hundred in the night.<br>
    Many nights we&rsquo;d sit together in the windy hut and fold,<br>
    And I helped the thing a little when I struck a patch of gold;<br>
    And we battled for the diggers as the papers seldom do,<br>
    Though when the diggers errored, why, we touched the diggers too.<br>
    Yet the paper took the fancy of that roaring mining town,<br>
    And the diggers sent a nugget with their sympathy to Brown.</p>
  <p>Oft I sat and smoked beside him in the listening hours of night,<br>
    When the shadows from the corners seemed to gather round the light&mdash;<br>
    When his weary, aching fingers, closing stiffly round the pen,<br>
    Wrote defiant truth in language that could touch the hearts of men&mdash;<br>
    Wrote until his eyelids shuddered&mdash;wrote until the East was grey:<br>
    Wrote the stern and awful lessons that were taught him in his day;<br>
    And they knew that he was honest, and they read his smallest par,<br>
    For I think the diggers&rsquo; Bible was the&nbsp;<i>Cambaroora Star</i>.</p>
  <p>Diggers then had little mercy for the loafer and the scamp&mdash;<br>
    If there wasn&rsquo;t law and order, there was justice in the camp;<br>
    And the manly independence that is found where diggers are<br>
    Had a sentinel to guard it in the&nbsp;<i>Cambaroora Star</i>.<br>
    There was strife about the Chinamen, who came in days of old<br>
    Like a swarm of thieves and loafers when the diggers found the gold&mdash;<br>
    Like the sneaking fortune-hunters who are always found behind,<br>
    And who only shepherd diggers till they track them to the &lsquo;find&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>Charlie wrote a slinging leader, calling on his digger mates,<br>
    And he said: &lsquo;We think that Chinkies are as bad as syndicates.<br>
    What&rsquo;s the good of holding meetings where you only talk and swear?<br>
    Get a move upon the Chinkies when you&rsquo;ve got an hour to spare.&rsquo;<br>
    It was nine o&rsquo;clock next morning when the Chows began to swarm,<br>
    But they weren&rsquo;t so long in going, for the diggers&rsquo; blood was
    warm.<br>
    Then the diggers held a meeting, and they shouted: &lsquo;Hip hoorar!<br>
    Give three ringing cheers, my hearties, for the&nbsp;<i>Cambaroora Star</i>.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But the Cambaroora petered, and the diggers&rsquo; sun went down,<br>
    And another sort of people came and settled in the town;<br>
    The reefing was conducted by a syndicate or two,<br>
    And they changed the name to &lsquo;Queensville&rsquo;, for their blood was
    very blue.<br>
    They wanted Brown to help them put the feathers in their nests,<br>
    But his leaders went like thunder for their vested interests,<br>
    And he fought for right and justice and he raved about the dawn<br>
    Of the reign of Man and Reason till his ads. were all withdrawn.</p>
  <p>He was offered shares for nothing in the richest of the mines,<br>
    And he could have made a fortune had he run on other lines;<br>
    They abused him for his leaders, and they parodied his rhymes,<br>
    And they told him that his paper was a mile behind the times.<br>
  &lsquo;Let the times alone,&rsquo; said Charlie, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re all right,
  you needn&rsquo;t fret;<br>
    For I started long before them, and they haven&rsquo;t caught me yet.<br>
    But,&rsquo; says he to me, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re coming, and they&rsquo;re
    not so very far&mdash;<br>
    Though I left the times behind me they are following the&nbsp;<i>Star</i>.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let them do their worst,&rsquo; said Charlie, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll
    never drop the reins<br>
    While a single scrap of paper or an ounce of ink remains:<br>
    I&rsquo;ve another truth to tell them, though they tread me in the dirt,<br>
    And I&rsquo;ll print another issue if I print it on my shirt.&rsquo;<br>
    So we fought the battle bravely, and we did our very best<br>
    Just to make the final issue quite as lively as the rest.<br>
    And the swells in Cambaroora talked of feathers and of tar<br>
    When they read the final issue of the&nbsp;<i>Cambaroora Star</i>.</p>
  <p>Gold is stronger than the tongue is&mdash;gold is stronger than the pen:<br>
    They&rsquo;d have squirmed in Cambaroora had I found a nugget then;<br>
    But in vain we scraped together every penny we could get,<br>
    For they fixed us with their boycott, and the plant was seized for debt.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a storekeeper who did it, and he sealed the paper&rsquo;s doom,<br>
    Though we gave him ads. for nothing when the&nbsp;<i>Star</i>&nbsp;began
    to boom:<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a paltry bill for tucker, and the crawling, sneaking clown<br>
    Sold the debt for twice its value to the men who hated Brown.</p>
  <p>I was digging up the river, and I swam the flooded bend<br>
    With a little cash and comfort for my literary friend.<br>
    Brown was sitting sad and lonely with his head bowed in despair,<br>
    While a single tallow candle threw a flicker on his hair,<br>
    And the gusty wind that whistled through the crannies of the door<br>
    Stirred the scattered files of paper that were lying on the floor.<br>
    Charlie took my hand in silence&mdash;and by-and-by he said:<br>
  &lsquo;Tom, old mate, we did our damnedest, but the brave old&nbsp;<i>Star</i>&nbsp;is
  dead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Then he stood up on a sudden, with a face as pale as death,<br>
    And he gripped my hand a moment, while he seemed to fight for breath:<br>
  &lsquo;Tom, old friend,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going, and I&rsquo;m
  ready to&mdash;to start,<br>
    For I know that there is something&mdash;something crooked with my heart.<br>
    Tom, my first child died. I loved her even better than the pen&mdash;<br>
    Tom&mdash;and while the&nbsp;<i>Star</i>&nbsp;was dying, why, I felt like
    I did&nbsp;<i>then</i>.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Listen! Like the distant thunder of the rollers on the bar&mdash;<br>
    Listen, Tom! I hear the&mdash;diggers&mdash;shouting: &lsquo;Bully for the&nbsp;<i>Star</i>!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

    The ghost of the man that I might have been is gone from my heart to-day;<br>

  <p>You&nbsp;almost heard the surface bake, and saw the gum-leaves turn&mdash;<br>
    You could have watched the grass scorch brown had there been grass to burn.<br>
    In such a drought the strongest heart might well grow faint and weak&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twould frighten Satan to his home&mdash;not far from Dingo Creek.</p>
  <p>The tanks went dry on Ninety Mile, as tanks go dry out back,<br>
    The Half-Way Spring had failed at last when Marshall missed the track;<br>
    Beneath a dead tree on the plain we saw a pack-horse reel&mdash;<br>
    Too blind to see there was no shade, and too done-up to feel.<br>
    And charcoaled on the canvas bag (&rsquo;twas written pretty clear)<br>
    We read the message Marshall wrote. It said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m taken queer&mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;m somewhere off of Deadman&rsquo;s Track, half-blind and nearly dead;<br>
    Find Crowbar, get him sobered up, and follow back,&rsquo; it said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let Mitchell go to Bandicoot. You&rsquo;ll find him there,&rsquo; said
    Mack.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll start the chaps from Starving Steers, and take the dry-holes
  back.&rsquo;<br>
    We tramped till dark, and tried to track the pack-horse on the sands,<br>
    And just at daylight Crowbar came with Milroy&rsquo;s station hands.<br>
    His cheeks were drawn, his face was white, but he was sober then&mdash;<br>
    In times of trouble, fire, and flood, &rsquo;twas Crowbar led the men.<br>
  &lsquo;Spread out as widely as you can each side the track,&rsquo; said he;<br>
  &lsquo;The first to find him make a smoke that all the rest can see.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We took the track and followed back where Crowbar followed fate,<br>
    We found a dead man in the scrub&mdash;but &rsquo;twas not Crowbar&rsquo;s
    mate.<br>
    The station hands from Starving Steers were searching all the week&mdash;<br>
    But never news of Marshall&rsquo;s fate came back to Dingo Creek.<br>
    And no one, save the spirit of the sand-waste, fierce and lone,<br>
    Knew where Jack Marshall crawled to die&mdash;but Crowbar might have known.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d scarcely closed his quiet eyes or drawn a sleeping breath&mdash;<br>
    They say that Crowbar slept no more until he slept in death.<br>
    A careless, roving scamp, that loved to laugh and drink and joke,<br>
    But no man saw him smile again (and no one saw him smoke),<br>
    And, when we spelled at night, he&rsquo;d lie with eyes still open wide,<br>
    And watch the stars as if they&rsquo;d point the place where Marshall died.</p>
  <p>The search was made as searches are (and often made in vain),<br>
    And on the seventh day we saw a smoke across the plain;<br>
    We left the track and followed back&mdash;&rsquo;twas Crowbar still that
    led,<br>
    And when his horse gave out at last he walked and ran ahead.<br>
    We reached the place and turned again&mdash;dragged back and no man spoke&mdash;<br>
    It was a bush-fire in the scrubs that made the cursed smoke.<br>
    And when we gave it best at last, he said, &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;see
    it through,&rsquo;<br>
    Although he knew we&rsquo;d done as much as mortal men could do.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not&mdash;I won&rsquo;t give up!&rsquo; he said, his hand
  pressed to his brow;<br>
  &lsquo;My God! the cursed flies and ants, they might be at him now.<br>
    I&rsquo;ll see it so in twenty years, &rsquo;twill haunt me all my life&mdash;<br>
    I could not face his sister, and I could not face his wife.<br>
    It&rsquo;s no use talking to me now&mdash;I&rsquo;m going back,&rsquo; he
    said,<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going back to find him, and I will&mdash;alive or dead!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>He packed his horse with water and provisions for a week,<br>
    And then, at sunset, crossed the plain, away from Dingo Creek.<br>
    We watched him tramp beside the horse till we, as it grew late,<br>
    Could not tell which was Bonypart and which was Marshall&rsquo;s mate.<br>
    The dam went dry at Dingo Creek, and we were driven back,<br>
    And none dared face the Ninety Mile when Crowbar took the track.</p>
  <p>They saw him at Dead Camel and along the Dry Hole Creeks&mdash;<br>
    There came a day when none had heard of Marshall&rsquo;s mate for weeks;<br>
    They&rsquo;d seen him at No Sunday, he called at Starving Steers&mdash;<br>
    There came a time when none had heard of Marshall&rsquo;s mate for years.<br>
    They found old Bonypart at last, picked clean by hungry crows,<br>
    But no one knew how Crowbar died&mdash;the soul of Marshall knows!</p>
  <p>And now, way out on Dingo Creek, when winter days are late,<br>
    The bushmen talk of Crowbar&rsquo;s ghost &lsquo;what&rsquo;s looking for
    his mate&rsquo;;<br>
    For let the fools indulge their mirth, and let the wise men doubt&mdash;<br>
    The soul of Crowbar and his mate have travelled further out.<br>

  <p>&rsquo;Twixt mother&rsquo;s arms and coffin-gear a man has work to do!<br>
    And if he does his very best he mostly worries through,<br>
    And while there is a wrong to right, and while the world goes round,<br>
    An honest man alive is worth a million underground.<br>
    And yet, as long as sheoaks sigh and wattle-blossoms bloom,<br>
    The world shall hear the drivel of the poets of the tomb.</p>
  <p>And though the graveyard poets long to vanish from the scene,<br>
    I notice that they mostly wish their resting-place kept green.<br>
    Now, were I rotting underground, I do not think I&rsquo;d care<br>
    If wombats rooted on the mound or if the cows camped there;<br>
    And should I have some feelings left when I have gone before,<br>
    I think a ton of solid stone would hurt my feelings more.</p>
  <p>Such wormy songs of mouldy joys can give me no delight;<br>
    I&rsquo;ll take my chances with the world, I&rsquo;d rather live and fight.<br>
    Though Fortune laughs along my track, or wears her blackest frown,<br>
    I&rsquo;ll try to do the world some good before I tumble down.<br>
    Let&rsquo;s fight for things that ought to be, and try to make &rsquo;em
    boom;<br>
    We cannot help mankind when we are ashes in the tomb.</p>

  <p>While&nbsp;you use your best endeavour to immortalise in verse<br>
    The gambling and the drink which are your country&rsquo;s greatest curse,<br>
    While you glorify the bully and take the spieler&rsquo;s part&mdash;<br>
    You&rsquo;re a clever southern writer, scarce inferior to Bret Harte.</p>
  <p>If you sing of waving grasses when the plains are dry as bricks,<br>
    And discover shining rivers where there&rsquo;s only mud and sticks;<br>
    If you picture &lsquo;mighty forests&rsquo; where the mulga spoils the view&mdash;<br>
    You&rsquo;re superior to Kendall, and ahead of Gordon too.</p>
  <p>If you swear there&rsquo;s not a country like the land that gave you birth,<br>
    And its sons are just the noblest and most glorious chaps on earth;<br>
    If in every girl a Venus your poetic eye discerns,<br>
    You are gracefully referred to as the &lsquo;young Australian Burns&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>But if you should find that bushmen&mdash;spite of all the poets say&mdash;<br>
    Are just common brother-sinners, and you&rsquo;re quite as good as they&mdash;<br>
    You&rsquo;re a drunkard, and a liar, and a cynic, and a sneak,<br>
    Your grammar&rsquo;s simply awful and your intellect is weak.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGhost"></a>The Ghost</b></h2>
  <p>Down&nbsp;the street as I was drifting with the city&rsquo;s human tide,<br>
    Came a ghost, and for a moment walked in silence by my side&mdash;<br>
    Now my heart was hard and bitter, and a bitter spirit he,<br>
    So I felt no great aversion to his ghostly company.<br>
    Said the Shade: &lsquo;At finer feelings let your lip in scorn be curled,<br>
  &lsquo;Self and Pelf&rsquo;, my friend, has ever been the motto for the world.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And he said: &lsquo;If you&rsquo;d be happy, you must clip your fancy&rsquo;s
    wings,<br>
    Stretch your conscience at the edges to the size of earthly things;<br>
    Never fight another&rsquo;s battle, for a friend can never know<br>
    When he&rsquo;ll gladly fly for succour to the bosom of the foe.<br>
    At the power of truth and friendship let your lip in scorn be curled&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Self and Pelf&rsquo;, my friend, remember, is the motto of the world.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where Society is mighty, always truckle to her rule;<br>
    Never send an &lsquo;i&rsquo; undotted to the teacher of a school;<br>
    Only fight a wrong or falsehood when the crowd is at your back,<br>
    And, till Charity repay you, shut the purse, and let her pack;<br>
    At the fools who would do other let your lip in scorn be curled,<br>
  &lsquo;Self and Pelf&rsquo;, my friend, remember, that&rsquo;s the motto of
  the world.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ne&rsquo;er assail the shaky ladders Fame has from her niches hung,<br>
    Lest unfriendly heels above you grind your fingers from the rung;<br>
    Or the fools who idle under, envious of your fair renown,<br>
    Heedless of the pain you suffer, do their worst to shake you down.<br>
    At the praise of men, or censure, let your lip in scorn be curled,<br>
  &lsquo;Self and Pelf&rsquo;, my friend, remember, is the motto of the world.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Flowing founts of inspiration leave their sources parched and dry,<br>
    Scalding tears of indignation sear the hearts that beat too high;<br>
    Chilly waters thrown upon it drown the fire that&rsquo;s in the bard;<br>
    And the banter of the critic hurts his heart till it grows hard.<br>
    At the fame your muse may offer let your lip in scorn be curled,<br>
  &lsquo;Self and Pelf&rsquo;, my friend, remember, that&rsquo;s the motto of
  the world.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shun the fields of love, where lightly, to a low and mocking tune,<br>
    Strong and useful lives are ruined, and the broken hearts are strewn.<br>
    Not a farthing is the value of the honest love you hold;<br>
    Call it lust, and make it serve you! Set your heart on nought but gold.<br>
    At the bliss of purer passions let your lip in scorn be curled&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Self and Pelf&rsquo;, my friend, shall ever be the motto of the world.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then he ceased and looked intently in my face, and nearer drew;<br>
    But a sudden deep repugnance to his presence thrilled me through;<br>
    Then I saw his face was cruel, by the look that o&rsquo;er it stole,<br>
    Then I felt his breath was poison, by the shuddering of my soul,<br>
    Then I guessed his purpose evil, by his lip in sneering curled,<br>
    And I knew he slandered mankind, by my knowledge of the world.</p>
  <p>But he vanished as a purer brighter presence gained my side&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Heed him not! there&rsquo;s truth and friendship in this wondrous world,&rsquo; she
  cried,<br>
    And of those who cleave to virtue in their climbing for renown,<br>
    Only they who faint or falter from the height are shaken down.<br>
    At a cynic&rsquo;s baneful teaching let your lip in scorn be curled!<br>
  &lsquo;Brotherhood and Love and Honour!&rsquo; is the motto for the world.&rsquo;</p>
