<p><i>Let him who is minded to meet with a Glug<br>
Pluck three hardy hairs from a rabbit-skin rug;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow one to the South, and one to the West,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then burn another and swallow the rest.<br>
And who shall explain </i>&rsquo;<i>tis the talk of a fool,<br>
He&rsquo;s a Glug!&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s a Glug of the old Gosh school!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he&rsquo;ll climb a tree, if the East wind blows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a casual way, just to show he knows . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, tickle his toes!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, tickle his toes!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And don&rsquo;t blame me if you come to blows.</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&mdash;Old Gosh

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="1TheGlugQuest"></a>1. - The Glug Quest</b></h2>
<p>Follow the river and cross the ford,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow again to the wobbly bridge,<br>
  Turn to the left at the notice board,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Climbing the cow-track over the ridge;<br>
  Tip-toe soft by the little red house,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Hold your breath if they touch the latch,<br>
  Creep to the slip-rails, still as a mouse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Then . . . run like mad for the bracken patch.</p>
<p>Worm your way where the fern fronds tall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Fashion a lace-work over your head,<br>
  Hemming you in with a high, green wall;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Then, when the thrush calls once, stop dead.<br>
  Ask of the old grey wallaby there&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Him prick-eared by the woollybutt tree&mdash;<br>
  How to encounter a Glug, and where<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The country of Gosh, famed Gosh may be.</p>
<p><i>But, if he is scornful, if he is dumb,<br>
  Hush! There&rsquo;s another way left. Then come.</i></p>
<p>On a white, still night, where the dead tree bends<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the track, like a waiting ghost,<br>
  Travel the winding road that wends<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the shore on an Eastern coast.<br>
  Follow it down where the wake of the moon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Kisses the ripples of silver sand;<br>
  Follow it on where the night seas croon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;A traveller&rsquo;s tale to the listening land.</p>
<p>Step not jauntily, not too grave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Till the lip of the languorous sea you greet;<br>
  Wait till the wash of the thirteenth wave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Tumbles a jellyfish out at your feet.<br>
  Not too hopefully, not forlorn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Whisper a word of your earnest quest;<br>
  Shed not a tear if he turns in scorn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And sneers in your face like a fish possessed.</p>
<p><i>Hist! Hope on! There is yet a way.<br>
  Brooding jellyfish won&rsquo;t be gay.</i></p>
<p>Wait till the clock in the tower booms three,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And the big bank opposite gnashes its doors,<br>
  Then glide with a gait that is carefully free<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;By the great brick building of seventeen floors;<br>
  Haste by the draper who smirks at his door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Straining to lure you with sinister force,<br>
  Turn up the lane by the second-hand store,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And halt by the light bay carrier&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>By the carrier&rsquo;s horse with the long, sad face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And the wisdom of years in his mournful eye;<br>
  Bow to him thrice with a courtier&rsquo;s grace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Proffer your query, and pause for reply.<br>
  Eagerly ask for a hint of the Glug,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Pause for reply with your hat in your hand;<br>
  If he responds with a snort and a shrug<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Strive to interpret and understand.</p>
<p><i>Rare will a carrier&rsquo;s horse condescend.<br>
  Yet there&rsquo;s another way. On to the end!</i></p>
<p>Catch the four-thirty; your ticket in hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Punched by the porter who broods in his box;<br>
  Journey afar to the sad, soggy land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing your shot-silk lavender socks.<br>
  Wait at the creek by the moss-grown log<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Till the blood of a slain day reddens the West.<br>
  Hark for the croak of a gentleman frog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Of a corpulent frog with a white satin vest.</p>
<p>Go as he guides you, over the marsh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Treading with care on the slithery stones,<br>
  Heedless of night winds moaning and harsh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;That seize you and freeze you and search for your bones.<br>
  On to the edge of a still, dark pool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Banishing thoughts of your warm wool rug;<br>
  Gaze in the depths of it, placid and cool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And long in your heart for one glimpse of a Glug.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Krock!&rdquo; Was he mocking you? &ldquo;Krock! Kor-r-rock!&rdquo;<br>
  Well, you bought a return, and it&rsquo;s past ten o&rsquo;clock.</i></p>
<p>Choose you a night when the intimate stars<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Carelessly prattle of cosmic affairs.<br>
  Flat on your back, with your nose pointing Mars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Search for the star who fled South from the Bears.<br>
  Gaze for an hour at that little blue star,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Giving him, cheerfully, wink for his wink;<br>
  Shrink to the size of the being you are;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Sneeze if you have to, but softly; then think.</p>
<p>Throw wide the portals and let your thoughts run<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the earth like a galloping herd.<br>
  Bounds to profundity let there be none,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be nothing too madly absurd.<br>
  Ponder on pebbles or stock exchange shares,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;On the mission of man or the life of a bug,<br>
  On planets or billiards, policemen or bears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Alert all the time for the sight of a Glug.</p>
<p>Meditate deeply on softgoods or sex,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;On carraway seeds or the causes of bills,<br>
  Biology, art, or mysterious wrecks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Or the tattered white fleeces of clouds on blue hills.<br>
  Muse upon ologies, freckles and fog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Why hermits live lonely and grapes in a bunch,<br>
  On the ways of a child or the mind of a dog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Or the oyster you bolted last Friday at lunch.</p>
<p><i>Heard you no sound like a shuddering sigh!<br>
  Or the great shout of laughter that swept down the sky?<br>
  Saw you no sign on the wide Milky Way?<br>
  Then there&rsquo;s naught left to you now but to pray.</i></p>
<p>Sit you at eve when the Shepherd in Blue<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Calls from the West to his clustering sheep.<br>
  Then pray for the moods that old mariners woo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;For the thoughts of young mothers who watch their babes sleep.<br>
  Pray for the heart of an innocent child,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;For the tolerant scorn of a weary old man,<br>
  For the petulant grief of a prophet reviled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;For the wisdom you lost when your whiskers began.</p>
<p>Pray for the pleasures that he who was you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Found in the mud of a shower-fed pool,<br>
  For the fears that he felt and the joys that he knew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;When a little green lizard crept into the school.<br>
  Pray as they pray who are maddened by wine:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;For distraction from self and a spirit at rest.<br>
  Now, deep in the heart of you search for a sign&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;If there be naught of it, vain is your quest.</p>
<p><i>Lay down the book, for to follow the tale<br>
  Were to trade in false blame, as all mortals who fail.<br>
  And may the gods salve you on life&rsquo;s dreary round;<br>
For &rsquo;tis whispered: &ldquo;Who finds not, &rsquo;tis he shall be found!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p align="center">

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="2JoiTheGlug"></a>2. - Joi, The Glug</b></h2>
<p>The Glugs abide in a far, far land<br>
  That is partly pebbles and stones and sand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mainly earth of a chocolate hue,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it isn&rsquo;t purple or slightly blue.<br>
  And the Glugs live there with their aunts and their wives,<br>
  In draught-proof tenements all their lives.<br>
  And they climb the trees when the weather is wet,<br>
  To see how high they can really get.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray,
  don&rsquo;t forget,<br>
  This is chiefly done when the weather is wet.</p>
<p><i>And every shadow that flits and hides,<br>
  And every stream that glistens and glides<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laughs its way from a highland height,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All know the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  And they say, &ldquo;Our test is the best by far;<br>
  For a Glug is a Glug; so there you are!<br>
  And they climb the trees when it drizzles or hails<br>
  To get electricity into their nails;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the Glug that fails<br>
  Is a luckless Glug, if it drizzles or hails.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Now, the Glugs abide in the lands of Gosh;<br>
  And they work all day for the sake of Splosh.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Splosh, the First, is the Nation&rsquo;s pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And King of the Glugs, on his uncle&rsquo;s side.<br>
  And they sleep at night, for the sake of rest;<br>
  For their doctors say this suits them best.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees, as a general rule,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For exercise, when the weather is cool.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re
  taught at school<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To climb the trees when the weather is cool.</p>
<p><i>And the whispering grass on the gay green hills<br>
  And every cricket that skirls and shrills,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every moonbeam, gleaming white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All know the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  And they say, &ldquo;It is safe, it is the test we bring;<br>
  For a Glug is an awful Gluglike thing.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees when there&rsquo;s a sign
  of fog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To scan the land for a feasible dog.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
  love to jog<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro&rsquo; dells in quest of a feasible dog.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The Glugs eat meals three times a day<br>
  Because their fathers ate that way.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their grandpas said the scheme was good<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the Glugs digest their food.<br>
  And &rsquo;tis wholesome food the Glugs have got,<br>
  For it says so plain on the tin and pot.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees when the weather is dry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get a glimpse of the pale green sky.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
  don&rsquo;t know why,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they like to gaze on the pale green sky.</p>
<p><i>And every cloud that sails aloft,<br>
  And every breeze that blows so soft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every star that shines at night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All know the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  For they say, &ldquo;Our test, it is safe and true;<br>
  What one Glug does, the other Glugs do;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees when the weather is hot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a birds&rsquo;-eye view of the garden plot.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
  course, it&rsquo;s rot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they love that view of the garden plot.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>At half-past two on a Wednesday morn<br>
  A most peculiar Glug was born;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And later on, when he grew a man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scoffed and sneered at the Chosen Plan.<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; said this Glug, whose name was Joi.<br>
  &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the Glugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a crazy boy!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climbed the trees, as the West wind stirred,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hark to the note of the Guffer Bird.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
  seems absurd,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they&rsquo;re foolishly fond of the Guffer Bird.</p>
<p><i>And every reed that rustles and sways<br>
  By the gurgling river that plashes and plays,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the beasts of the dread, neurotic night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All know the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  And, &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; say they; &ldquo;It is easily done;<br>
  For a dexter Glug&rsquo;s like a sinister one!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, they climb
  the trees!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they bark their knuckles, and chafe their knees;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &rsquo;tis one of the world&rsquo;s
  great mysteries<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
  things like these<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get into the serious histories.</i></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="3TheStonesOfGosh"></a>3 - The Stones Of Gosh</b></h2>
<p>Now, here is a tale of the Glugs of Gosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a wonderful tale I ween,<br>
  Of the Glugs of Gosh and their great King Splosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tush, his virtuous Queen.<br>
  And here is a tale of the crafty Ogs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their neighbouring land of Podge;<br>
  Of their sayings and doings and plottings and brewings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And something about Sir Stodge.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wise
  to profundity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stout
  to rotundity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the Knight, Sir Stodge.</p>
<p>Oh, the King was rich, and the Queen was fair,<br>
  And they made a very respectable pair.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whenever a Glug in that peaceful land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did anything no one could understand,<br>
  The Knight, Sir Stodge, he looked in a book,<br>
  And charged that Glug with a crime called Crook.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great Judge Fudge, who wore for a hat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred skin of a tortoiseshell cat,<br>
  He fined that Glug for his action rash,<br>
  And frequently asked a deposit in cash.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then every Glug, he went home to his rest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his head in a bag and his toes to the West;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
  they knew it was best,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since their grandpas slept with their toes to the West.</p>
<p>But all of the tale that is so far told<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has nothing whatever to do<br>
  With the Ogs of Podge, and their crafty dodge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the trade in pickles and glue.<br>
  To trade with the Glugs came the Ogs to Gosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they said in seductive tones,<br>
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sell you pianers and pickels and spanners<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For seventeen shiploads of stones:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smooth &rsquo;uns
  or nobbly  &rsquo;uns,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firm &rsquo;uns
  or wobbly &rsquo;uns,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All we ask is stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the King said, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; and the Queen said, &ldquo;Why,<br>
  That is awfully cheap to the things I buy!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For that grocer of ours in the light brown hat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asks two and eleven for pickles like that!&rdquo;<br>
  But a Glug stood up with a wart on his nose,<br>
  And cried, &ldquo;Your Majesties! Ogs is foes!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Glugs cried, &ldquo;Peace! Will you hold your jaw!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did our grandpas fashion the law?&rdquo;<br>
  Said the Knight, Sir Stodge, as he opened his Book,<br>
  &ldquo;When the goods were cheap then the goods we took.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they fined the Glug with the wart on his nose<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For wearing a wart with his everyday clothes.<br>
  And the goods were brought home thro&rsquo; a Glug named Ghones;<br>
  And the Ogs went home with their loads of stones,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which they landed with glee in the land of Podge.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do
  you notice the dodge?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet did the Glugs, nor the Knight, Sir Stodge.</p>
<p>In the following Summer the Ogs came back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a cargo of eight-day clocks,<br>
  And hand-painted screens, and sewing machines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mangles, and scissors, and socks.<br>
  And they said, &ldquo;For these excellent things we bring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are ready to take more stones;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
  in bricks or road-metal<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
  goods you will settle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indented by your Mister Ghones.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried
  the Glugs praisingly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
  how amazingly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart of industrious Ghones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the King said, &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; and the Queen said, &ldquo;Oo!<br>
  That curtain!&nbsp;&nbsp;What a bee-ootiful blue!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a Glug stood up with some very large ears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And said, &ldquo;There is more in this thing than appears!<br>
  And we ought to be taxing those goods of the Ogs,<br>
  Or our industries soon will be gone to the dogs.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the King said, &ldquo;Bosh!&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re
  un-Gluggish and rude!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Queen said, &ldquo;What an absurd attitude!&rdquo;<br>
  Then the Glugs cried, &ldquo;Down with political quacks!<br>
  How did our grandpas look at a tax?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened his Book.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No tax,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;wherever I look.&rdquo;<br>
  Then they fined the Glug with the prominent ears<br>
  For being old-fashioned by several years;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Ogs went home with the stones, full-steam.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did
  you notice the scheme?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet did the Glugs in their dreamiest dreams.</p>
<p>Then every month to the land of the Gosh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ogs, they continued to come,<br>
  With buttons and hooks, and medical books,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rotary engines, and rum,<br>
  Large cases with labels, occasional tables,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hair tonic and fiddles and &rsquo;phones;<br>
  And the Glugs, while copncealing their joy in the dealing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paid promptly in nothing but stones.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why,
  it was screamingly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laughable,
  seemingly&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asking for nothing but stones!</p>
<p>And the King said, &ldquo;Haw!&rdquo; and the Queen said, &ldquo;Oh!<br>
  Our drawing-room now is a heavenly show<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of large overmantels, and whatnots, and chairs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a statue of Splosh at the head of the stairs!&rdquo;<br>
  But a Glug stood up with a cast in his eye,<br>
  And he said, &ldquo;Far too many baubles we buy;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all the Gosh factories closing their doors,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And importers&rsquo; warehouses lining our shores.&rdquo;<br>
  But the Glugs cried, &ldquo;Down with such meddlesome fools!<br>
  What did our grandpas lay down in their rules?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened his Book:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;To Cheapness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was the road
  they took.&rdquo;<br>
  Then every Glug who was not too fat<br>
  Turned seventeen handsprings, and jumped on his hat.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fined the Glug with the cast in his eye<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For looking both ways&mdash;which he did not deny&mdash;<br>
  And for having no visible precedent, which<br>
  Is a crime in the poor and a fault in the rich.</p>
<p>So the Glugs continued, with greed and glee,<br>
  To buy cheap clothing, and pills, and tea;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till every Glug in the land of Gosh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owned three clean shirts and a fourth in the wash.<br>
  But they all grew idle, and fond of ease,<br>
  And easy to swindle, and hard to please;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the voice of Joi was a lonely voice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he railed at Gosh for its foolish choice.<br>
  But the great King grinned, and the good Queen gushed,<br>
  As the goods of the Ogs were madly rushed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Knight, Sir Stodge, with a wave of his hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Declared it a happy and prosperous land.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="4SymTheSonOfJoi"></a>4 - Sym, The Son Of Joi</b></h2>
<p>Now Joi, the rebel, he had a son<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In far, far Gosh where the tall trees wave.<br>
  Said Joi: &ldquo;In Gosh there shall yet be one<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To scorn this life of a self-made slave;<br>
  To spurn the law of the Knight, Sir Stodge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And end the rule of the great King Splosh;<br>
  Who shall warn the Glugs of their crafty dodge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at last bring peace, sweet peace, to
  Gosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Whenever the kind sun showers<br>
  His golden treasure on grateful flowers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With upturned faces and hearts bowed low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glugs shall know what the wild things know.&rdquo;<br>
  Said he: &ldquo;Wherever the broad fields smile,<br>
  They shall walk with clean minds, free of guile;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall scoff aloud at the call of Greed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn to their labours and never heed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Joi had a son, and his name was Sym;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his eyes were wide as the eyes of Truth;<br>
  And there came to the wondering mind of him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long thoughts of the riddle that vexes youth.<br>
  And, &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the mart&rsquo;s loud din<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there aught of pleasure?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do
  some find joy?&rdquo;<br>
  But his father tilted the beardless chin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked in the eyes of the questing boy.</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Whenever the fields are green,<br>
  Lie still, where the wild rose fashions a screen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the brown thrush calls to his love-wise mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know what they profit who trade with Hate.&rdquo;<br>
  Said he: &ldquo;Whenever the great skies spread,<br>
  In the beckoning vastness overhead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tent for the blue wren building a nest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, down in the heart of you, learn what&rsquo;s
  best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there came to Sym as he walked afield<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep thoughts of the world and the folk of Gosh.<br>
  He saw the idols to which they kneeled;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He marked them cringe to the name of Splosh.<br>
  &ldquo;Is it meet,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that a soul should crawl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a purple robe or a gilded chair?&rdquo;<br>
  But his father walked to the garden&rsquo;s wall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stooped to a rose-bush flowering there.</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Whenever a bursting bloom<br>
  Looks up to the sun, may a soul find room<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a measure of awe at the wondrous birth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one more treasure to this glad earth.&rdquo;<br>
  Said he: &ldquo;Whenever a dewdrop clings<br>
  To a gossamer thread, and glitters and swings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in humility bow your head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a thing for a blundering mortal&rsquo;s dread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there came to Sym in his later youth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first clear glance in the face of guile,<br>
  Thirst for knowledge and thoughts of truth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gilded baubles, and things worth while.<br>
  And he said, &ldquo;There is much that a Glug should know;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mind is clouded, his years are
  few.&rdquo;<br>
  Then Joi, the father, he answered low<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his thoughts ran back to the youth he
  knew.</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Whenever the West wind stirs,<br>
  And birds in feathers and beasts in furs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steal out to dance in the glade, lie still:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your heart teach you what it will.&rdquo;<br>
  Said he: &ldquo;Whenever the moonlight creeps<br>
  Thro&rsquo; inlaced boughs, and a shy star peeps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adown from its crib in the cradling sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know of their folly who fear to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New interest came to the mind of Sym,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As &rsquo;midst his fellows he lived and toiled.<br>
  But the ways of the Glug folk puzzled him;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some won honour, while some were foiled;<br>
  Yet all were filled with a vague unrest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they climbed their trees in an endless search.<br>
  But Joi, the father, he mocked their quest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he marked a Glug on his hard-won perch.</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Whenever these tales are heard<br>
  Of the Feasible Dog or the Guffer Bird,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then laugh and laugh till the fat tears roll<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the roots of the joy-bush deep in your soul.<br>
  When you see them squat on the tree-tops high,<br>
  Scanning for ever that heedless sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie flat on your back on the good, green earth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And roar till the great vault echoes your mirth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he walked in the city, to Sym there came<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds envenomed with fear and hate,<br>
  Shouts of anger and words of shame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Glug blamed Glug for his woeful state.<br>
  &ldquo;This blame?&rdquo; said Sym, &ldquo;Is it mortal&rsquo;s right<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To blame his fellow for aught he be?&rdquo;<br>
  But the father said, &ldquo;Do we blame the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When darkness gathers and none can see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Whenever there springs from earth<br>
  A plant all crooked and marred at birth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we, unlearned in the Gardener&rsquo;s scheme,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blame plant or earth for the faults that seem?&rdquo;<br>
  Said he: &ldquo;Whenever your wondering eyes<br>
  Look out on the glory of earth and skies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall you, &rsquo;mid the blessing of fields a-bloom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fling blame at the blind man, prisoned in gloom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Joi had a son, and his name was Sym;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the ken of the great King Splosh.<br>
  And small was the Glugs&rsquo; regard of him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mooning along in the streets of Gosh.<br>
  But many a creature by field and ford<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared in the schooling of that strange boy,<br>
  Dreaming and planning to gather and hoard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge of all things precious to Joi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="5TheGrowthOfSym"></a>5. The Growth Of Sym</b></h2>
<p>Now Sym was a Glug; and &rsquo;tis mentioned so<br>
  That the tale reads perfectly plain as we go.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his veins ran blood of that stupid race<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of docile folk, who inhabit the place<br>
  Called Gosh, sad Gosh, where the tall trees sigh<br>
  With a strange, significant sort of cry<br>
  When the gloaming creeps and the wind is high.</p>
<p>When the deep shades creep and the wind is high<br>
  The trees bow low as the gods ride by:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods of the gloaming, who ride on the breeze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stooping to hearten the birds and the trees.<br>
  But each dull Glug sits down by his door,<br>
  And mutters, &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis windy!&rdquo; and nothing more,<br>
  Like the long-dead Glugs in the days of yore.</p>
<p>When Sym was born there was much to-do,<br>
  And his parents thought him a joy to view;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But folk not prejudiced saw the Glug,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his nurse remarked, &ldquo;In the cut of his mug.&rdquo;<br>
  For he had their hair, and he had their eyes,<br>
  And the Glug expression of pained surprise,<br>
  And their predilection for pumpkin pies.</p>
<p>And his parents&rsquo; claims were a deal denied<br>
  By his maiden aunt on his mother&rsquo;s side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall Glug lady of fifty-two<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slight moustache of an auburn hue.<br>
  &ldquo;Parental blither!&rdquo; she said quite flat.<br>
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an average Glug; and he&rsquo;s red and fat!<br>
  And exceedingly fat and red at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the father, Joi, when he gazed on Sym,<br>
  Dreamed great and wonderful things for him.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he, &ldquo;If the mind of a Glug could wake<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Oh, what a wonderful Glug he&rsquo;d make!<br>
  We shall teach this laddie to play life&rsquo;s game<br>
  With a different mind and a definite aim:<br>
  A Glug in appearance, yet not the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the practical aunt said, &ldquo;Fudge!&nbsp;&nbsp;You fool!<br>
  We&rsquo;ll pack up his dinner and send him to school.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall learn about two-times and parsing and capes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how to make money with inches on tapes.<br>
  We&rsquo;ll apprentice him then to the drapery trade,<br>
  Where, I&rsquo;ve heard it reported, large profits are made;<br>
  Besides, he can sell us cheap buttons and braid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So poor young Sym, he was sent to school,<br>
  Where the first thing taught is the Golden Rule.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do unto others,&rdquo; the teacher said . .
  .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly stopped and scratched his head.<br>
  &ldquo;You may look up the rest in a book,&rdquo; said he.<br>
  &ldquo;At present it doesn&rsquo;t occur to me;<br>
  But do it, whatever it happens to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the teacher, &ldquo;the day&rsquo;s task brings<br>
  Consideration of practical things.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man makes a profit of fifteen pounds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one week&rsquo;s takings from two milk rounds,<br>
  How many . . .&rdquo; And Sym went dreaming away<br>
  To the sunlit lands where the field-mice play,<br>
  And wrens hold revel the livelong day.</p>
<p>He walked in the welcoming fields alone,<br>
  While from far, far away came the pedagogue&rsquo;s drone:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If a man makes . . . Multiply . . . Abstract
  nouns . . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From B take . . . Population of towns . . .<br>
  Rods, poles or perches . . . Derived from Greek . . .&rdquo;<br>
  Oh, the hawthorn buds came out this week,<br>
  And robins are nesting down by the creek.</p>
<p>So Sym was head of his class not once;<br>
  And his aunt repeatedly dubbed him &ldquo;Dunce.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, &ldquo;Give him a chance,&rdquo; said his father,
  Joi.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;His head is abnormally large for a boy.&rdquo;<br>
  But his aunt said, &ldquo;Piffie! It&rsquo;s crammed with bosh!<br>
  Why, he don&rsquo;t know the rivers and mountains of Gosh,<br>
  Nor the names of the nephews of good King Splosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Gosh, when a youth gets an obstinate look,<br>
  And copies his washing-bill into a book,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blackens his boot-heels, and frowns at a joke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s getting sense,&rdquo; say the
  elderly folk.<br>
  But Sym, he would laugh when he ought to be sad;<br>
  Said his aunt, &ldquo;Lawk-a-mussy!&nbsp;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s wrong with the
  lad?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He romps with the puppies, and talks to the ants,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keeps his loose change in his second-best pants,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stumbles all over my cauliflower plants!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is wisdom in that,&rdquo; laughed the father, Joi.<br>
  But the aunt said, &ldquo;Toity!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Drat the boy!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He shall play,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;some
  noble part.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows but it may be in letters or art?<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a dignified business to make folk think.&rdquo;<br>
  But the aunt cried, &ldquo;What!&nbsp;&nbsp;Go messing with ink?<br>
  And smear all his fingers, and take to drink?<br>
Paint hussies and cows, and end in the clink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the argument ran; but one bright Spring day<br>
  Sym settled it all in his own strange way.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a tramp,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  decided to be;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I start next Monday at twenty to three . . .&rdquo;<br>
  When the aunt recovered she screamed, &ldquo;A tramp?<br>
  A low-lived, pilfering, idle scamp,<br>
  Who steals people&rsquo;s washing, and sleeps in the damp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharp to the hour Sym was ready and dressed.<br>
  &ldquo;Young birds,&rdquo; sighed the father, &ldquo;must go from the nest.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the green moss covers those stones you tread,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the green grass whispers above my head,<br>
  Mark well, wherever your path may turn,<br>
  They have reached the valley of peace who learn<br>
  That wise hearts cherish what fools may spurn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Sym went off; and a year ran by,<br>
  And the father said, with a smile-masked sigh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It is meet that the young should leave the nest.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the aunt, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spill that soup on
  your vest!<br>
  Nor mention his name! He&rsquo;s our one disgrace!<br>
  And he&rsquo;s probably sneaking around some place<br>
  With fuzzy black whiskers all over his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, under a hedge, by a flowering peach,<br>
  A youth with a little blue wren held speech.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his back to a tree and his feet in the grass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched the thistle-down drift and pass,<br>
  And the cloud-puffs, borne on a lazy breeze,<br>
  Move by on their errand, above the trees,<br>
  Into the vault of the mysteries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, teach me, little blue wren,&rdquo; said he.<br>
  &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis you can unravel this riddle for me.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am &rsquo;mazed by the gifts of this kindly earth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of them all has the greatest worth?&rdquo;<br>
  He flirted his tail as he answered then,<br>
  He bobbed and he bowed to his coy little hen:<br>
&ldquo;Why, sunlight and worms!&rdquo; said the little blue wren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="6TheEndOfJoi"></a>6 - The End Of Joi</b></h2>
<p>They climbed the trees . . . As was told before,<br>
  The Glugs climbed trees in the days of yore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the oldest tree in the land to-day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a tender little seedling&mdash;Nay,<br>
  This climbing habit was old, so old<br>
  That even the cheeses could not have told<br>
  When the past Glug people first began<br>
  To give their lives to the climbing plan.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the legend ran<br>
  That the art was old as the mind of man.</p>
<p><i>And even the mountains old and hoar,<br>
  And the billows that broke on Gosh&rsquo;s shore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the far-off neolithic night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All knew the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  And they tell of a perfectly easy way:<br>
  For yesterday&rsquo;s Glug is the Glug of to-day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees when the thunder rolls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solemnly salve their shop-worn souls.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
  they fear the coals<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That threaten to frizzle their shop-worn souls.</i></p>
<p>They climbed the trees. &rsquo;Tis a bootless task<br>
  To say so over again, or ask<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of it all, or the reason why<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never felt happier up on high.<br>
  For Joi asked why; and Joi was a fool,<br>
  And never a Glug of the fine old school<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fixed opinions and Sunday clothes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the habit of looking beyond its nose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  treating foes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the calm contempt of the One Who Knows.</p>
<p><i>And every spider who heaves a line<br>
  And trusts to his luck when the day is fine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or reckless swings from an awful height,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  &ldquo;You can never mistake them,&rdquo; he will say;<br>
  &ldquo;For they always act in a Gluglike way.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees when the glass points fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With circumspection and proper care,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
  they fear to tear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very expensive clothes they wear.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>But Joi was a Glug with a twisted mind<br>
  Of the nasty, meditative kind.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d meditate on the modes of Gosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dared to muse on the acts of Splosh;<br>
  He dared to speak, and, worse than that,<br>
  He spoke out loud, and he said it flat.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why climb?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When
  you reach the top<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s nowhere to go, and you have to stop,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
  you drop.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the higher you are the worse you flop.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>And every cricket that chirps at eve,<br>
  And scoffs at the folly of fools who grieve,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the furtive mice who revel at night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All know the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  For, &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo; in the land of Gosh<br>
  There is no one else who will bow to Splosh.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees when the rain pelts down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feeds the gutters that thread the town;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
  they fear to drown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When floods are frothy and waters brown.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Said the Glug called Joi, &ldquo;This climbing trees<br>
  Is a foolish art, and things like these<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause much distress in the land of Gosh.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s stay on the ground and kill King Splosh!&rdquo;<br>
  But Splosh, the king, he smiled a smile,<br>
  And beckoned once to his hangman, Guile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who climbed a tree when the weather was calm;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they hanged poor Joi on a Snufflebust Palm;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
  they sang a psalm,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did those pious Glugs &rsquo;neath the Snufflebust
  Palm.</p>
<p><i>And every bee that kisses a flow&rsquo;r,<br>
  And every blossom, born for an hour,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every bird on its gladsome flight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All know the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  For they say, &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a simple test we&rsquo;ve got:<br>
  If you know one Glug, why, you know the lot!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they climbed a tree in the bourgeoning Spring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they hanged poor Joi with some second-hand string.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis
  a horrible thing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be hanged by Glugs with second-hand string.</i></p>
<p>Then Splosh, the king, rose up and said,<br>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not polite; but he&rsquo;s safer dead.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there&rsquo;s not much room in the land of Gosh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a Glug named Joi and a king called Splosh!&rdquo;<br>
  And every Glug flung high his hat,<br>
  And cried, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Glugs! and you can&rsquo;t change that!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they climbed the trees, since the weather was cold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the brazen bell of the city tolled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  tolled, and told<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of a Glug who was over-bold.</p>
<p><i>And every cloud that sails the blue,<br>
  And every dancing sunbeam too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every sparkling dewdrop bright<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All know the Glugs quite well by sight.<br>
  &ldquo;We tell,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;by a simple test;<br>
  For any old Glug is like the rest.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees when there&rsquo;s weather
  about,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a general way, as a cure for gout;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho&rsquo;  some
  folks doubt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the climbing habit is good for gout.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So Joi was hanged, and his race was run,<br>
  And the Glugs were tickled with what they&rsquo;d done.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after that, if a day should come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Glug felt extra specially glum,<br>
  He&rsquo;d call his children around his knee,<br>
  And tell that tale with a chuckle of glee.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And should a little Glug girl or boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See naught of a joke in the fate of Joi,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
  he&rsquo;d employ<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stern measures with such little girl or boy.</p>
<p><i>But every dawn that paints the sky,<br>
  And every splendid noontide high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All know the Glugs so well, so well.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis an easy matter, and plain to tell.<br>
  For, lacking wit, with a candour smug,<br>
  A Glug will boast that he is a Glug.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees, if it shines or rains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To settle the squirming in their brains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the darting pains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That are caused by rushing and catching trains.</i></p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="7TheSwanksOfGosh"></a>7. The Swanks Of Gosh</b></h2>
<p>Come mourn with me for the land of Gosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, weep with me for the luckless Glugs<br>
  Of the land of Gosh, where the sad seas wash<br>
  The patient shores, and the great King Splosh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His
  sodden sorrow hugs;<br>
  Where the fair Queen Tush weeps all the day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Swank, the Swank, the naughty Swank,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  haughty Swank holds sway&mdash;<br>
  The most mendacious, ostentatious,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacious
  Swank holds sway.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis sorrow-swathed, as I know full well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And garbed in gloom and the weeds of woe,<br>
  And vague, so far, is the tale I tell;<br>
  But bear with me for the briefest spell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  surely shall ye know<br>
  Of the land of Gosh, and Tush, and Splosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Stodge, the Swank, the foolish Swank,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  mulish Swank of Gosh&mdash;<br>
  The meretricious, avaricious,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicious
  Swank of Gosh.</p>
<p><i>Oh, the tall trees bend, and green trees send<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chuckle round the earth,<br>
  And the soft winds croon a jeering tune,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the harsh winds shriek with mirth,<br>
  And the wee small birds chirp ribald words<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Swank walks down the street;<br>
  But every Glug takes off his hat,<br>
  And whispers humbly, &ldquo;Look at that!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hats off! Hats off to the Glug of rank!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Stodge, the Swank, the Lord High Swank!&rdquo;<br>
  Then the East wind roars a loud guffaw,<br>
  And the haughty Swank says, &ldquo;Haw!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>His brain is dull, and his mind is dense,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his lack of saving wit complete;<br>
  But most amazingly immense<br>
  Is his inane self-confidence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  his innate conceit.<br>
  But every Glug, and great King Splosh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowed to Sir Stodge, the fuddled Swank,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  muddled Swank of Gosh&mdash;<br>
  The engineering, peeping, peering,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sneering
  Swank of Gosh.</p>
<p>In Gosh, sad Gosh, where the Lord Swank lives,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds high rank, and he has much pelf;<br>
  And all the well-paid posts he gives<br>
  Unto his fawning relatives,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
  foolish as himself.<br>
  In offices and courts and boards<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Swanks, and Swanks, ten dozen Swanks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  cousin Swanks in hordes&mdash;<br>
  Inept and musty, dry and dusty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rusty
  Swanks in hordes.</p>
<p><i>The clouds so soft, that sail aloft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep laughing tears of rain;<br>
  The blue sky spread high overhead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peeps thro&rsquo; in mild disdain.<br>
  All nature laughs and jeers and chaffs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Swank goes out to walk;<br>
  But every Glug bows low his head,<br>
  And says in tones surcharged with dread,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bow low, bow low, Glugs lean, Glugs fat!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the North wind snatches off his
  hat,<br>
  And flings it high, and shrieks to see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His
  ruffled dignity.</i></p>
<p>They lurk in every Gov&rsquo;ment lair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Mid docket dull and dusty file,<br>
  Solemnly squat in an easy chair,<br>
  Penning a minute of rare hot air<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
  departmental style.<br>
  In every office, on every floor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Swanks, and Swanks, distracting Swanks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  Acting-Swanks a score,<br>
  And coldly distant, sub-assistant<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under-Swanks
  galore.</p>
<p>In peaceful days when the countryside<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poured wealth to Gosh, and the skies were blue,<br>
  The great King Splosh no fault espied,<br>
  And seemed entirely satisfied<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
  Swanks who muddled thro&rsquo;.<br>
  But when they fell on seasons bad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, then the Swanks, the bustled Swanks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  hustled Swanks went mad&mdash;<br>
  The minute-writing, nation-blighting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skiting
  Swanks went mad.</p>
<p><i>The tall trees sway like boys at play,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mock him when he grieves,<br>
  As one by one, in laughing fun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pelt him with their leaves.<br>
  And the gay green trees joke to the breeze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Swank struts proudly by;<br>
  But every Glug, with reverence,<br>
  Pays homage to his pride immense&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A homage deep to lofty rank&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swank!&nbsp;The Swank!&nbsp;The pompous Swank!<br>
  But the wind-borne leaves await their chance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  round him gaily dance.</i></p>
<p>Now, trouble came to the land of Gosh:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of battle, and anxious days;<br>
  And the Swanks were called to the great King Splosh,<br>
  Who said that their system would not wash,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  ordered other ways.<br>
  Then the Lord High Swank stretched forth a paw,<br>
  And penned a minute <i>re</i> the law,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Swanks, the Swanks, the other Swanks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  brother Swanks said, &ldquo;Haw!&rdquo;<br>
  These keen, resourceful, unremorseful,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forceful
  Swanks said, &ldquo;Haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Splosh, the king, in a royal rage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smote his throne as he thundered, &ldquo;Bosh!<br>
  In the whole wide land is there not one sage<br>
  With a cool, clear brain, who&rsquo;ll straight engage<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
  sweep the Swanks from Gosh?&rdquo;<br>
  But the Lord High Stodge, from where he stood,<br>
  Cried, &ldquo;Barley! . . . Guard your livelihood!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, quick as light, the teeming Swanks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  scheming Swanks touched wood.<br>
  Sages, plainly, labour vainly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
  the Swanks touch wood.</p>
<p><i>The stealthy cats that grace the mats<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the doors of Gosh,<br>
  Smile wide with scorn each sunny morn;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as they take their wash,<br>
  A sly grimace o&rsquo;erspreads each face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Swank struts forth to court.<br>
  But every Glug casts down his eyes,<br>
  And mutters, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;is &rsquo;at a size!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a sight our gods we thank.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Stodge, the Swank!&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble Swank!&rdquo;<br>
  But the West wind tweaks his nose in sport;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the Swank struts into court.</i></p>
<p>Then roared the King with a rage intense,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, who can cope with their magic tricks?&rdquo;<br>
  But the Lord High Swank skipped nimbly hence,<br>
  And hid him safe behind the fence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
  Regulation VI.<br>
  And under Section Four Eight 0 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swanks, the Swanks, dim forms of Swanks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  swarms of Swanks lay low&mdash;<br>
  These most tenacious, perspicacious,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacious
  Swanks lay low.</p>
<p>Cried the King of Gosh, &ldquo;They shall not escape!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I set at naught by a crazed buffoon?&rdquo;<br>
  But in fifty fathoms of thin red tape<br>
  The Lord Swank swaddled his portly shape,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
  a large, insane cocoon.<br>
  Then round and round and round and round.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swanks, the Swanks, the whirling Swanks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  twirling Swanks they wound&mdash;<br>
  The swathed and swaddled, molly-coddled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swanks
  inanely wound.</p>
<p><i>Each insect thing that comes in Spring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gladden this sad earth,<br>
  It flits and whirls and pipes and skirls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It chirps in mocking mirth<br>
  A merry song the whole day long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the Swank abroad.<br>
  But every Glug, whoe&rsquo;er he be,<br>
  Salutes, with grave humility<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deference to noble rank,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swank, the Swank, the swollen Swank;<br>
  But the South wind blows his clothes awry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  flings dust in his eye.</i></p>
<p>So trouble stayed in the land of Gosh;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the futile Glugs could only gape,<br>
  While the Lord High Swank still ruled King Splosh<br>
  With laws of blither and rules of bosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
  out his lair of tape.<br>
  And in cocoons that mocked the Glug<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swanks, the Swanks, the under-Swanks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  dunder Swanks lay snug.<br>
  These most politic, parasitic,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critic
  Swanks lay snug.</p>
<p>Then mourn with me for a luckless land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, weep with me for the slaves of tape!<br>
  Where the Lord High Swank still held command,<br>
  And wrote new rules in a fair round hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the Glugs saw no escape;<br>
  Where tape entwined all Gluggish things,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Swank, the Swank, the grievous Swank,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  devious Swank pulled strings&mdash;<br>
  The perspicacious, contumacious<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swank
  held all the strings.</p>
<p>The blooms that grow, and, in a row,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peep o&rsquo;er each garden fence,<br>
  They nod and smile to note his style<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ponderous pretence;<br>
  Each roving bee has fits of glee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Swank goes by that way.<br>
  But every Glug, he makes his bow,<br>
  And says, &ldquo;Just watch him!&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch him now!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have thousands in the bank!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swank!&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swank! The holy Swank!&rdquo;<br>
  But the wild winds snatch his kerchief out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
buffet him about.</p>
<h2><b><a name="8TheSeer"></a>8. The Seer</b></h2>
<p>Somewhere or other, &rsquo;tis doubtful where,<br>
  In the archives of Gosh is a volume rare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A precious old classic that nobody reads,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nobody asks for, and nobody heeds;<br>
  Which makes it a classic, and famed thro&rsquo; the land,<br>
  As well-informed persons will quite understand.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis a ponderous work, and &rsquo;tis written in prose,<br>
  For some mystical reason that nobody knows;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it tells in a style that is terse and correct<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the rule of the Swanks and its baneful effect<br>
  On the commerce of Gosh, on its morals and trade;<br>
  And it quotes a grave prophecy somebody made.</p>
<p>And this is the prophecy, written right bold<br>
  On a parchment all tattered and yellow and old;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So old and so tattered that nobody knows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far into foretime its origin goes.<br>
  But this is the writing that set Glugs agog<br>
  When &rsquo;twas called to their minds by the Mayor of Quog:</p>
<p><i><b>When Gosh groaneth bastlie thro Greed and bys plannes<br>
Ye rimer shall mende ye who mendes pottes and pans.</b></i></p>
<p>Now, the Mayor of Quog, a small suburb of Gosh,<br>
  Was intensely annoyed at the act of King Splosh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking the Mayor of Piphel to tea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With himself and the Queen on a Thursday at three;<br>
  When the King must have known that the sorriest dog,<br>
  If a native of Piphel, was hated in Quog.</p>
<p>An act without precedent!&nbsp;&nbsp;Quog was ignored!<br>
  The Mayor and Council and Charity Board,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They met and considered this insult to Quog;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said, &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis the work of the treacherous
  Og!<br>
  &rsquo;Tis plain the Og influence threatens the Throne;<br>
  And the Swanks are all crazed with this trading in stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the Mayor of Quog: &ldquo;This has long been foretold<br>
  In a prophecy penned by the Seer of old.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must search, if we&rsquo;d banish the curse of our
  time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a mender of pots who&rsquo;s a maker of rhyme.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis to him we must look when our luck goes amiss.<br>
But, Oh, where in all Gosh is a Glug such as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Mayor and Council and Charity Board<br>
  O&rsquo;er the archival prophecy zealously pored,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a pursing of lips and a shaking of heads,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a searching and prying for possible threads<br>
  That would lead to discover this versatile Glug<br>
  Who modelled a rhyme while he mended a mug.</p>
<p>With a pursing of lips and a shaking of heads,<br>
  They gave up the task and went home to their beds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where each lay awake while he tortured his brain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a key to the riddle, but ever in vain . . .<br>
  Then, lo, at the Mayor&rsquo;s front door in the morn<br>
  A tinker called out, and a Movement was born.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Kettles and pans!&nbsp;&nbsp;Kettles and pans!<br>
  Oh, the stars are the gods&rsquo;; but the earth, it is man&rsquo;s.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a fool is the man who has wants without end,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the tinker&rsquo;s content with a kettle to mend.<br>
  For a tinker owns naught but the earth, which is man&rsquo;s.<br>
  Then, bring out your kettles!&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho, kettles and pans!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>From the mayoral bed with unmayoral cries<br>
  The magistrate sprang ere he&rsquo;d opened his eyes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; he yelled, as he bounced on
  the floor.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, who is this tinker that rhymes at my door?<br>
  Go get me the name and the title of him!&rdquo;<br>
  They answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Be calm, sir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis no one
  but Sym.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis Sym, the mad tinker, the son of old Joi,<br>
  Who ran from his home when a bit of a boy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went for a tramp, tho&rsquo; &rsquo;tis common belief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When folk were not looking he went for a thief;<br>
  Then went for a tinker, and rhymes as he goes.<br>
  Some say he&rsquo;s crazy, but nobody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twas thus it began, the exalting of Sym,<br>
  And the mad Gluggish struggle that raged around him.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the good Mayor seized him, and clothed him in silk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fed him on pumpkins and pasteurised milk,<br>
  And praised him in public, and coupled his name<br>
  With Gosh&rsquo;s vague prophet of archival fame.</p>
<p>The Press interviewed him a great many times,<br>
  And printed his portrait, and published his rhymes;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the King and Sir Stodge and the Swanks grew afraid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his fame &rsquo;mid the Glugs and the trouble it
  made.<br>
  For, wherever Sym went in the city of Gosh,<br>
  There were cheers for the tinker, and hoots for King Splosh.</p>
<p>His goings and comings were watched for and cheered;<br>
  And a crowd quickly gathered where&rsquo;er he appeared.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the folk flocked around him and shouted his praise;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Glugs followed fashion, and Sym was a craze.<br>
  They sued him for words, which they greeted with cheers,<br>
  For the way with a Glug is to tickle his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, speak to us, Tinker!&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wisdom we crave!&rdquo;<br>
  They&rsquo;d cry when they saw him; then Sym would look grave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And remark, with an air, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a very fine
  day.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now ain&rsquo;t he a marvel?&rdquo; they&rsquo;d
  shout.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hip, Hooray!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;To live,&rdquo; would Sym answer, &ldquo;To live is to feel!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t he a poet?&rdquo; a fat Glug would squeal.</p>
<p>Sym had a quaint fancy in phrase and in text;<br>
  When he&rsquo;d fed them with one they would howl for the next.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he&rsquo;d cry, &ldquo;Love is love!&rdquo; and
  the welkin they&rsquo;d lift<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their shouts of surprise at his wonderful gift.<br>
  He would say &ldquo;After life, then a Glug must meet death!&rdquo;<br>
  And they&rsquo;d clamour for more ere he took the next breath.</p>
<p>But Sym grew aweary of this sort of praise,<br>
  And he longed to be back with his out-o&rsquo;-door days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his feet in the grass and his back to a tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhyming and tinkering, fameless and free.<br>
  He said so one day to the Mayor of Quog,<br>
  And declared he&rsquo;d as lief live the life of a dog.</p>
<p>But the Mayor was vexed; for the Movement had grown,<br>
  And his dreams had of late soared as high as a throne.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have a care! What is written is written,&rdquo; said
  he.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And the dullest Glug knows what is written must
  be.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the prophet of Gosh who has prophesied it;<br>
  And &rsquo;tis thus that &rsquo;tis written by him who so writ:</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Lo, the Tinker of Gosh he shall make him three rhymes:<br>
  One on the errors and aims of his times,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One on the symptoms of sin that he sees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the third and the last on whatever he please.<br>
  And when the Glugs hear them and mark what they mean<br>
  The land shall be purged and the nation made clean.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Sym gave a promise to write then and there<br>
  Three rhymes to be read in the Great Market Square<br>
  To all Glugs assembled on Saturday week.<br>
  &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said the Mayor, &ldquo;if still you must seek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to your tramping, well, just have your fling;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&rsquo;ll make you a marquis, or any old thing
  . . .&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Sym, &ldquo;I shall tinker, and still be a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="9TheRhymesOfSym"></a>9. The Rhymes Of Sym</b></h2>
<p>Nobody knew why it should be so;<br>
  Nobody knew or wanted to know.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have been checked had but someone dared<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To trace its beginnings; but nobody cared.<br>
  But &rsquo;twas clear to the wise that the Glugs of those days<br>
  Were crazed beyond reason concerning a craze.</p>
<p>They would pass a thing by for a week or a year,<br>
  With an air apathetic, or maybe a sneer:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ev&rsquo;ryday thing, like a crime or a creed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mode or a movement, and pay it small heed,<br>
  Till Somebody started to laud it aloud;<br>
  Then all but the Nobodies followed the crowd.</p>
<p>Thus, Sym was a craze; tho&rsquo;, to give him his due,<br>
  He would rather have strayed from the popular view.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the Glugs had him they held him so tight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he could not be nobody, try as he might.<br>
  He had to be Somebody, so they decreed.<br>
  For Craze is an appetite, governed by Greed.</p>
<p>So on Saturday week to the Great Market Square<br>
  Came every Glug who could rake up his fare.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came from the suburbs, they came from the town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came from the country Glugs bearded and brown,<br>
  Rich Glugs, with cigars, all well-tailored and stout,<br>
  Jostled commonplace Glugs who dropped aitches about.</p>
<p>There were gushing Glug maids, well aware of their charms,<br>
  And stern, massive matrons with babes in their arms.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were querulous dames who complained of the &ldquo;squash,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pushing and squeezing; for, briefly, all Gosh,<br>
  With its aunt and its wife, stood agape in the ranks&mdash;<br>
  Excepting Sir Stodge and his satellite Swanks.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Quog took the chair for the day;<br>
  And he made them a speech, and he ventured to say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a Glug was a Glug, and the Cause they held dear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a very dear Cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Glugs said, &ldquo;Hear,
  hear.&rdquo;<br>
  Then Sym took the stage to a round of applause<br>
  From thousands who suddenly found they&rsquo;d a Cause.</p>

<p align="center"><i>THE FIRST RHYME OF SYM</i></p>
<p><i>We strive together in life&rsquo;s crowded mart,<br>
  </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Keen-eyed, with clutching hands to over-reach.<br>
    We scheme, we lie, we play the selfish part,<br>
  </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Masking our lust for gain with gentle speech;<br>
    And masking too&mdash;O pity ignorance!&mdash;<br>
    Our very selves behind a careless glance.</i></p>
<p><i>Ah, foolish brothers, seeking e&rsquo;er in vain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one dear gift that lies so near at hand;<br>
  Hoping to barter gold we meanly gain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that the poorest beggar in the land<br>
  Holds for his own, to hoard while yet he spends;<br>
  Seeking fresh treasure in the hearts of friends.</i></p>
<p><i>We preach; yet do we deem it worldly-wise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To count unbounded brother-love a shame,<br>
  So, ban the brother-look from out our eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest sparks of sympathy be fanned to flame.<br>
  We smile; and yet withhold, in secret fear,<br>
  The word so hard to speak, so sweet to hear&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>The Open Sesame to meanest hearts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic word, to which stern eyes grow soft,<br>
  And crafty faces, that the cruel marts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have seared and scored, turn gentle&mdash;Nay, how
  oft<br>
  It trembles on the lip to die unspoke,<br>
  And dawning love is stifled with a joke.</i></p>
<p><i>Nay, brothers, look about your world to-day:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world to you so drab, so commonplace&mdash;<br>
  The flowers still are blooming by the way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As blossom smiles upon the sternest face.<br>
  In every hour is born some thought of love;<br>
  In every heart is hid some treasure-trove.</i></p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>With a modified clapping and stamping of feet<br>
  The Glugs mildly cheered him, as Sym took his seat.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some said &rsquo;twas clever, and some said &rsquo;twas
  grand-<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More especially those who did not understand.<br>
  And some said, with frowns, tho&rsquo; the words sounded plain,<br>
  Yet it had a deep meaning they craved to explain.</p>
<p>But the Mayor said: Silence!&nbsp;&nbsp;He wished to observe<br>
  That a Glug was a Glug; and in wishing to serve<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This glorious Cause, which they&rsquo;d asked him to
  lead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had proved they were Glugs of the noble old breed<br>
  That made Gosh what it was . . . and he&rsquo;d ask the police<br>
  To remove that small boy while they heard the next piece.</p>
<p align="center"><i>THE SECOND RHYME OF SYM</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Now come,&rdquo; said the Devil, he said to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his swart face all a-grin,<br>
  &ldquo;This day, ere ever the clock strikes three,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall you sin your darling sin.<br>
  For I&rsquo;ve wagered a crown with Beelzebub,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall tempt you once, I shall tempt you twice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet thrice shall you fall ere I tempt you thrice.&rdquo;</i></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have no darling sin.<br>
  But many there be, and I know them well,<br>
  All foul with sinning and ripe for Hell.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I name no names, but the whole world knows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I am never of such as those.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;How now?&rdquo; said the Devil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spread
    my net,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I vow I&rsquo;ll gather you in!<br>
  By this and by that shall I win my bet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shall sin the sin!<br>
  Come, fill up a bumper of good red wine,<br>
  Your heart shall sing, and your eye shall shine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall know such joy as you never have known.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the salving of men was the good vine grown.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Begone, red Devil!&rdquo; I made reply.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Parch shall these lips of mine,<br>

  A tipsy score of my friends in Hell.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I name no names, but the whole world wots<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of my fellows are drunken sots.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; said the Devil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You scorn the wine!<br>

  To win me a crown from a friend of mine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere three o&rsquo; the clock this day.<br>
  Are you calling to mind some lady fair?<br>
  And is she a wife or a maiden rare?<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stolen kisses are sweet, forsooth!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Begone, foul Devil!&rdquo; I made reply;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be she maid, or widow, or wife.<br>
  But my brothers!&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! I am scandalized<br>
  By their evil passions so ill disguised.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I name no names, but my thanks I give<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I loathe the lives my fellow-men live.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; roared the Devil in fiendish glee.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a silver crown I win!<br>
  Thrice have you fallen! O Pharisee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have sinned your darling sin!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;But, nay,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and I scorn your lure.<br>
  I have sinned no sin, and my heart is pure.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, show me a sign of the sin you see!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Devil was gone . . . and the clock struck three.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>With an increase of cheering and waving of hats&mdash;<br>
  While the little boys squealed, and made noises like cats&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glugs gave approval to Sym&rsquo;s second rhyme.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some said &rsquo;twas thoughtful, and some said &rsquo;twas
  prime;<br>
  And some said &rsquo;twas witty, and had a fine end:<br>
  More especially those who did not comprehend.</p>
<p>And some said with leers and with nudges and shrugs<br>
  That, they mentioned no names, but it hit certain Glugs.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And others remarked, with superior smiles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While dividing the metrical feet into miles,<br>
  That the thing seemed quite simple, without any doubt,<br>
  But the anagrams in it would need thinking out.</p>
<p>But the Mayor said, Hush!&nbsp;&nbsp;And he wished to explain<br>
  That in leading this Movement he&rsquo;d nothing to gain.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was ready to lead, since they trusted him so;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, wherever he led he was sure Glugs would go.<br>
  And he thanked them again, and craved peace for a time,<br>
  While this gifted young man read his third and last rhyme.</p>
<p align="center"><i>THE LAST RHYME OF SYM</i></p>
<p><i>(To sing you a song and a sensible song is a worthy and excellent thing;<br>
  But how could I sing you that sort of a song, if there&rsquo;s never a song
  to sing?)<br>
  At ten to the tick, by the kitchen clock, I marked him blundering by,<br>
  With his eyes astare, and his rumpled hair, and his hat cocked over his eye.<br>
  Blind, in his pride, to his shoes untied, he went with a swift jig-jog,<br>
  Off on the quest, with a strange unrest, hunting the Feasible Dog.<br>
  And this is the song, as he dashed along, that he sang with a swaggering swing&mdash;<br>
  (Now how had I heard him singing a song if he hadn&rsquo;t a song to sing?)</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the authentic, identical beast!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feasible Dog, and the terror of Gosh!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
  know by the prowl of him.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark
  to the growl of him!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heralding death to the subjects of Splosh.<br>
  Oh, look at him glaring and staring, by thunder!<br>
  Now each for himself, and the weakest goes under!</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Beware this injurious, furious brute;<br>

  incredible,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything edible<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappears suddenly into his maw:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his cavernous inner interior<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanishes evrything strictly superior.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>He calls it &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he calls it &ldquo;Wine,&rdquo;  he calls
    it &ldquo;Devils&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dice&rdquo;;<br>
  He calls it &ldquo;Surfing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sunday Golf&rdquo; and names that
  are not so nice.<br>
  But whatever he calls it&mdash;&rdquo;Morals&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mirth&rdquo;&mdash;he
  is on with the hunt right quick<br>
  For his sorrow he&rsquo;d hug like a gloomy Glug if he hadn&rsquo;t a dog to
  kick.<br>
  So any old night, if the stars are right, you will find him, hot on the trail<br>
  Of a feasible dog and a teasable dog, with a can to tie to his tail.<br>
  And the song that he roars to the shuddering stars is a worthy and excellent
  thing.<br>
  (Yet how could you hear him singing a song if there wasn&rsquo;t a song to
  sing?)</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched his abdominous, ominous shape<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurgles and groans of the beastliest brand.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;m aware his ambitions are bold;<br>
  For he&rsquo;s yearning and burning to snare the superior<br>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Such a shouting and yelling of hearty Bravoes,<br>
  Such a craning of necks and a standing on toes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to leave ne&rsquo;er a doubt that the Tinker&rsquo;s
  last rhyme<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had now won him repute &rsquo;mid the Glugs for all
  time.<br>
  And they all said the rhyme was the grandest they&rsquo;d heard:<br>
  More especially those who had not caught a word.</p>
<p>But the Mayor said: Peace! And he stood, without fear,<br>
  As the leader of all to whom Justice was dear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Tinker had rhymed, as the Prophet foretold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a light was let in on the errors of old.<br>
  For in every line, and in every verse<br>
  Was the proof that Sir Stodge was a traitor, and worse!</p>
<p>Sir Stodge (said the Mayor), must go from his place;<br>
  And the Swanks, one and all, were a standing disgrace!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the influence won o&rsquo;er a weak, foolish king<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a menace to Gosh, and a scandalous thing!<br>
  &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Mayor, &ldquo;I stand here to-day<br>
  As your leader and friend.&rdquo; And the Glugs said, &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they went to their homes in the suburbs and town;<br>
  To their farms went the Glugs who were bearded and brown.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portly Glugs with cigars went to dine at their clubs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While illiterate Glugs had one more at the pubs.<br>
  And each household in Gosh sat and talked half the night<br>
  Of the wonderful day, and the imminent fight.</p>
<p>Forgetting the rhymer, forgetting his rhymes,<br>
  They talked of Sir Stodge and his numerous crimes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was hardly a Glug in the whole land of Gosh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&rsquo;d a lenient word to put in for King Splosh.<br>
  One and all, to the mangiest, surliest dog,<br>
  Were quite eager to bark for his Worship of Quog.</p>
<p>Forgotten, unnoticed, Sym wended his way<br>
  To his lodging in Gosh at the close of the day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &rsquo;twas there, to his friend and companion
  of years&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his little red dog with the funny prick ears&mdash;<br>
  That he poured out his woe; seeking nothing to hide;<br>
  And the little dog listened, his head on one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O you little red dog, you are weary as I.<br>
  It is days, it is months since we saw the blue sky.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems weary years since we sniffed at the breeze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it hums thro&rsquo; the hedges and sings in the
  trees.<br>
  These we know and we love.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this city holds fears,<br>
  O my friend of the road, with the funny prick ears.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for what may we hope from his Worship of Quog?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, and a bone, and a kick,&rdquo; said the
little red dog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="10TheDebate"></a>10. The Debate</b></h2>
<p>He was a Glug of simple charm;<br>
  He wished no living creature harm.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His kindly smile like sunlight fell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all about, and wished them well.<br>
  Yet, &rsquo;spite the cheerful soul of Sym,<br>
  The great Sir Stodge detested him.</p>
<p>The stern Sir Stodge and all his Swanks&mdash;<br>
  Proud Glugs of divers grades and ranks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With learning and attainments great&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had never learned to conquer hate.<br>

  Turned out great hordes of learned fools:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned out the ship without a sail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned out the kite with leaden tail,<br>
  Turned out the mind that could not soar<br>

<p>Because there&rsquo;d been no father Joi<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from thoughts of hate and blame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom in these was but a name.<br>
  But &rsquo;mid the Glugs they count him wise<br>
  Who walks with cunning in his eyes.</p>
<p>His task well done, his three rhymes writ,<br>
  Sym rose at morn, and packed his kit.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Off
  and away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet again the spendthrift Day,<br>
  As he comes climbing in the East,<br>
  To bless with largesse man and beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again the fields where wild things run!<br>
  And trees, all spreading to the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run not, because, of all things blest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their chosen place contents them best.<br>
  O come, my little prick-eared dog!&rdquo; . . .<br>
  But, &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; exclaimed his Nibs of Quog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo;  said the Mayor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not so fast!<br>
  The day climbs high, but sinks at last.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trees, all spreading to the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are slain because they cannot run.<br>
  The great Sir Stodge, filled full of hate,<br>
  Has challenged you to hold debate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Monday, in the Market Square,<br>
  He and his Swanks will all be there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp to the tick at half-past two,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To knock the stuffing out of you.<br>
  And if your stuffing so be spread,<br>
  Then is the Cause of Quog stone dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this debate I&rsquo;d have you find,<br>
  With all the cunning of your mind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure victory for Quog&rsquo;s great Cause,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swift defeat for Stodge&rsquo;s laws.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;But cunning I have none,&rdquo; quoth Sym.<br>
  The Mayor slowly winked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  cried his Worship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sly; so sly!&rdquo;<br>
  (Again he drooped his dexter eye)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read you thro&rsquo;; I&rsquo;ve
  marked you well.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re cunning as an imp from Hell . . .<br>
  Nay, keep your temper; for I can<br>
  Withal admire a clever man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who rhymes with such a subtle art<br>
  May never claim a simple part.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll make of you a Glug of rank,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With something handy in the bank,<br>
  And fixed opinions, which, you know,<br>
  With fixed deposits always go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you anything you crave:<br>
  A great, high headstone to your grave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A salary, a scarlet coat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handsome wife, a house, a vote,<br>
  A title, or a humbled foe.&rdquo;<br>
  But Sym said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and ever, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  shouted Quog, &ldquo;your aid I claim<br>
  For Gosh, and in your country&rsquo;s name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bid you fight the Cause of Quog,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or be for ever named a dog!<br>
  The Cause of Quog, the weal of Gosh<br>
  Are one!&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Down with King Splosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sym looked his Worship in the eye,<br>
  As solemnly he made reply:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If &rsquo;tis to serve my native land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday I shall be at hand.<br>
  But what am I &rsquo;mid such great men?&rdquo;<br>
  His Worship winked his eye again . . .</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Monday in the Market Square;<br>
  Sir Stodge and all his Swanks were there.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And almost every Glug in Gosh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had bolted lunch and had a wash<br>
  And cleaned his boots, and sallied out<br>
  To gloat upon Sir Stodge&rsquo;s rout.</p>
<p>And certain sly and knowing Glugs,<br>
  With sundry nudges, winks and shrugs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed round the hint that up on high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind some window near the sky,<br>
  Where he could see yet not be seen,<br>
  King Splosh was present with his Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glugs,&rdquo;  said the chairman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Glugs of Gosh;<br>
  By order of our good King Splosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tinker and Sir Stodge shall meet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, without unseemly heat,<br>
  Debate the question of the day,<br>
  Which is&mdash;However, let me say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to waste your time.<br>
  So, first shall speak this man of rhyme;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when Sir Stodge has voiced his view,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glugs shall judge between the two.<br>
  This verdict from the folk of Gosh<br>
  Will be accepted by King Splosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As when, like teasing vagabonds,<br>
  The sly winds buffet sullen ponds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Stodge grew dark with rage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sym stepped forth upon the stage.<br>
  But all the Glugs, with one accord,<br>
  A chorus of approval roared.</p>
<p>Said Sym: &ldquo;Kind friends, and fellow Glugs;<br>
  My trade is mending pots and mugs.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tinker kettles, and I rhyme<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To please myself and pass the time,<br>
  Just as my fancy wandereth.&rdquo;<br>
  (&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; quoth Stodge, below his breath.)</p>
<p>Said Sym: &ldquo;Why I am here to-day<br>
  I know not; tho&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve heard them say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That strife and hatred play some part<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this great meeting at the Mart.<br>
  Nay, brothers, why should hatred lodge . . .<br>
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ultra vires!&rdquo; thundered Stodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis ultra vires!&rdquo; cried the Knight.<br>
  &ldquo;Besides, it isn&rsquo;t half polite.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And e&rsquo;en the dullest Glug should know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis not pro bono publico.<br>
  Nay, Glugs, this fellow is no class.<br>
  Remember!&nbsp;&nbsp;Vincit veritas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With sidelong looks and sheepish grins,<br>
  Like men found out in secret sins,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glug gazed at Glug in nervous dread;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till one with claims to learning said,<br>
  &ldquo;Sir Stodge is talking Greek, you know.<br>
  He may be bad, but never low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then those who had no word of Greek<br>
  Felt lifted up to hear him speak.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, learning, learning,&rdquo; others said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis fine to have a clever head.&rdquo;<br>
  And here and there a nervous cheer<br>
  Was heard, and someone growled, &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind friends,&rdquo; said Sym . . . But, at a glance,<br>
  The &rsquo;cute Sir Stodge had seen his chance.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quid nunc!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O
  noble Glugs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fellow takes you all for mugs.<br>
  I ask him, where&rsquo;s his quid pro quo?<br>
  I ask again, quo warranto?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall this man filch our wits from us<br>
  With his furor poeticus?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay!&rdquo; cried Sir Stodge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You
  must agree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will hark a while to me<br>
  And at the Glugs&rsquo; collective head<br>
  He flung strange language, ages dead.</p>
<p>With mystic phrases from the Law,<br>
  With many an old and rusty saw,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With well-worn mottoes, which he took<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haphazard from the copy-book,<br>
  For half an hour the learned Knight<br>
  Belaboured them with all his might.</p>
<p>And, as they wakened from their daze,<br>
  Their murmurs grew to shouts of praise.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glugs who&rsquo;d reviled him overnight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a moment saw the light.<br>
  &ldquo;O learned man! O seer!&rdquo; cried they. . . .<br>
  And education won the day.</p>
<p>Then, quickly to Sir Stodge&rsquo;s side<br>
  There bounded, in a single stride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Nibs of Quog; and flinging wide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arms, &ldquo;O victory!&rdquo; he cried.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with Sir Stodge, O Glugs of Gosh!<br>
  And we have won!&nbsp;&nbsp;Long live King Splosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then pointing angrily at Sym,<br>
  Cried Quog, &ldquo;This is the end of him!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For months I&rsquo;ve marked his crafty dodge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring dishonour to Sir Stodge.<br>
  I&rsquo;ve lured him here, the traitrous dog,<br>
  And shamed him!&rdquo; quoth his Nibs of Quog.</p>
<p>Hoots for the Tinker tore the air,<br>
  As Sym went, wisely, otherwhere.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers for Sir Stodge were long and loud;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as amid his Swanks he bowed,<br>
  To mark his thanks and honest pride,<br>
  His Nibs of Quog bowed by his side.</p>
<p>The Thursday after that, at three,<br>
  The King invited Quog to tea.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth Quog, &ldquo;It was a task to bilk . . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I thank you; sugar, please, <i>and</i> milk) . . .<br>
  To bilk this Tinker and his pranks.<br>
  A scurvy rogue! . . . (Ah, <i>two</i> lumps, thanks.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scurvy rogue!&rdquo; continued Quog.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas easy to outwit the dog.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altho&rsquo;, perhaps, I risked my life&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s handy with a knife.<br>
  Ah, well, &rsquo;twas for my country&rsquo;s sake . . .<br>
(Thanks; just one slice of currant cake.)&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="11Ogs"></a>11. Ogs</b></h2>
<p>It chanced one day, in the middle of May,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came to the great King Splosh<br>
  A policeman, who said, while scratching his head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a stone in Gosh<br>
  To throw at a dog; for the crafty Og,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Saturday week, at one,<br>
  Took our last blue-metal, in order to settle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bill for a toy pop-gun.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said
  the King, jokingly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why,
  how provokingly<br>
  Weird; but we have the gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the King said, &ldquo;Well, we are stony-broke.&rdquo;<br>
  But the Queen could not see it was much of a joke.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she said, &ldquo;If the metal is all used up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray what of the costume I want for the Cup?<br>
  It all seems so dreadfully simple to me.<br>
  The stones?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, import them from over the sea.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a Glug stood up with a mole on his chin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, with a most diabolical grin,<br>
  &ldquo;Your Majesties, down in the country of Podge,<br>
  A spy has discovered a very &rsquo;cute dodge.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Ogs are determined to wage a war<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Gosh, next Friday, at half-past four.&rdquo;<br>
  Then the Glugs all cried, in a terrible fright,<br>
  &ldquo;How did our grandfathers manage a fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened his Book,<br>
  And he read, &ldquo;Some very large stones they took,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flung at the foe, with exceeding force;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was very effective, tho&rsquo; rude, of course.&rdquo;<br>
  And lo, with sorrowful wails and moans,<br>
  The Glugs cried, &ldquo;Where, Oh, where are the stones?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some rushed North, and a few ran West;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking the substitutes seeming best.<br>
  And they gathered the pillows and cushions and rugs<br>
  From the homes of the rich and middle-class Glugs.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a hasty message they managed to send<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craving the loan of some bricks from a friend.</p>
<p>On the Friday, exactly at half-past four,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Ogs with triumphant glee.<br>
  And the first of their stones hit poor Mister Ghones,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of industry.<br>
  Then a pebble of Podge took the Knight, Sir Stodge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the curve of his convex vest.<br>
  He gurgled &ldquo;Un-Gluggish!&rdquo; His heart growing sluggish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He solemnly sank to rest.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis
  inconceivable,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely
  believable,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, he was sent to rest.</p>
<p>And the King said, &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; And the Queen said, &ldquo;Oo!<br>
  My bee-ootiful drawing-room!&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall I do?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the warlike Ogs, they hurled great rocks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro&rsquo; the works of the wonderful eight-day clocks<br>
  They had sold to the Glugs but a month before&mdash;<br>
  Which was very absurd; but, of course, &rsquo;twas war.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Glugs cried, &ldquo;What would our grandfathers
  do<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they hadn&rsquo;t the stones that they one time
  threw?&rdquo;<br>
  But the Knight, Sir Stodge, and his mystic Book<br>
  Oblivious slept in a grave-yard nook.</p>
<p>Then a Glug stood out with a pot in his hand,<br>
  As the King was bewailing the fate of his land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, &ldquo;If these Ogs you desire to retard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then hit them quite frequent with anything hard.&rdquo;<br>
  So the Glugs seized anvils, and editors&rsquo; chairs,<br>
  And smote the Ogs with them unawares;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bottles of pickles, and clocks they threw,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And books of poems, and gherkins, and glue,<br>
  Which they&rsquo;d bought with the stones&mdash;as, of course, you know&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;From the Ogs but a couple of months ago.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was simply inane, when you reason it o&rsquo;er;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And uneconomic, but then, it was war.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;d fought for a night and the most of a day,<br>
  The Ogs threw the last of their metal away.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they went back to Podge, well content with their
  fun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with much satisfaction, declared they had won.<br>
  And the King of the Glugs gazed around on his land,<br>
  And saw nothing but stones strewn on every hand:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great stones in the palace, and stones in the street,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stones on the house-tops and under the feet.<br>
  And he said, with a desperate look on his face,<br>
  &ldquo;There is nothing so ghastly as stones out of place.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, no doubt, this Og scheme was a very smart dodge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whom does it profit&mdash;my people, or Podge?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="12EmilyAnn"></a>12. Emily Ann</b></h2>
<p>Government muddles, departments dazed,<br>
  Fear and confusion wherever he gazed;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order insulted, authority spurned,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dread and distraction wherever he turned&mdash;<br>
  Oh, the great King Splosh was a sad, sore king,<br>
  With never a statesman to straighten the thing.</p>
<p>Glus all importunate urging their claims,<br>
  With selfish intent and ulterior aims,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glugs with petitions for this and for that,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing ten-deep on the royal door-mat,<br>
  Raging when nobody answered their ring&mdash;<br>
  Oh, the great King Splosh was a careworn king.</p>
<p>And he looked to the right, and he glanced to the left,<br>
  And he glared at the roof like a monarch bereft<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his wisdom and wits and his wealth all in one;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, at least once a minute, asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
  to be done?&rdquo;<br>
  But the Swanks stood around him and answered, with groans,<br>
  &ldquo;Your majesty, Gosh is half buried in stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now?&rdquo; cried the King.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there not in my
  land<br>
  One Glug who can cope with this dreadful demand:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rich man, a poor man, a beggar man, thief&mdash;<br>

  A soldier, a sailor, a&mdash;&rdquo; Raising his head,<br>
  With relief in his eye, &ldquo;Now, I mind me!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind me a Tinker, and what once befel,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he shall be honoured, and he shall be famed<br>

  named?<br>
  Some commonplace title, like&mdash;Simon?&mdash;No&mdash;Sym!<br>
  Go, send out my riders, and scour Gosh for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode for a day to the sea in the South,<br>
  Calling the name of him, hand to the mouth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rode for a day to the hills in the East,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But signs of a tinker saw never the least.<br>
  Then they rode to the North thro&rsquo; a whole day long,<br>
  And paused in the even to hark to a song.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Kettles and pans!&nbsp;&nbsp;Kettles and pans!<br>
  Oh, who can show tresses like Emily Ann&rsquo;s?<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright as the smile on her beckoning lips.<br>
  Bring out your kettle! O kettle or pan!<br>
  So I buy me a ribband for Emily Ann.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>With his feet in the grass, and his back to a tree,<br>
  Merry as only a tinker can be,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busily tinkering, mending a pan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing as only a merry man can . . .<br>
  &ldquo;Sym!&rdquo; cried the riders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis thus you
  are styled?&rdquo;<br>
  And he paused in his singing, and nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Last eve, when the sun was low,<br>
  Down thro&rsquo; the bracken I watched her go&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down thro&rsquo; the bracken, with simple grace&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the glory of eve shone full on her face;<br>
  And there on the sky-line it lingered a span,<br>
  So loth to be leaving my Emily Arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With hands to their faces the riders smiled.<br>
  &ldquo;Sym,&rdquo; they said&mdash;&ldquo;be it so you&rsquo;re styled&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, great Splosh, our sorrowing King,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has sent us hither, that we may bring<br>
  To the palace in Gosh a Glug so named,<br>
  That he may be honoured and justly famed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo;  said Sym, as he tinkered his can,<br>
  &ldquo;What should you know of her, Emily Ann?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early as cock-crow yester morn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched young sunbeams, newly born,<br>
  As out of the East they frolicked and ran,<br>
  Eager to greet her, my Emily Arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;King Splosh,&rdquo; said the riders, &ldquo;is bowed with grief;<br>
  And the glory of Gosh is a yellowing leaf.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up with you, Tinker!&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s work
  ahead.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a King forsaken, and Swanks in dread,<br>
  To whom may we turn for the salving of man?&rdquo;<br>
  And Sym, he answered them, &ldquo;Emily Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Whenever I watch her pass,<br>
  With her skirts so high o&rsquo;er the dew-wet grass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envy every blade the bruise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It earns in the cause of her twinkling shoes.<br>
  Oh, the dew-wet grass, where this morn she ran,<br>
  Was doubly jewelled for Emily Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haste!&rdquo; they cried.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;By the palace gates<br>
  A sorrowing king for a tinker waits.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what shall we answer our Lord the King<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If never a tinker hence we bring,<br>
  To tinker a kingdom so sore amiss?&rdquo;<br>
  But Sym, he said to them, &ldquo;Answer him this:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every eve, when the clock chimes eight,<br>
  I kiss her fair, by her mother&rsquo;s gate:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice, all reverent, on the brow&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once for a pray&rsquo;r, and once for a vow;<br>
  Twice on her eyes that they may shine,<br>
  Then, full on the mouth because she&rsquo;s mine.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calf!&rdquo;  sneered the riders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O Tinker, heed!<br>
  Mount and away with us, we must speed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Gosh is agog for the coming of Sym.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garlands and greatness are waiting for him:<br>
  Garlands of roses, and garments of red<br>
  And a chaplet for crowning a conqueror&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo;  quoth Sym, as he stirred his fire.<br>
  &ldquo;Once in my life have I known desire.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Oh, but the touch of her kindled a flame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That burns as a sun by the candle of fame.<br>
  And a blessing and boon for a poor tinker man<br>
  Looks out from the eyes of my Emily Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they said to him, &ldquo;Fool!&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you cast aside<br>
  Promise of honour, and place, and pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold for the asking, and power o&rsquo;er men&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working your will with the stroke of a pen?<br>
  Vexed were the King if you ride not with us.&rdquo;<br>
  But Sym, he said to them, &ldquo;Answer him thus:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ease and honour and leave to live&mdash;<br>
  These are the gifts that a king may give<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas over the meadow I saw her first;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my lips grew parched like a man athirst<br>
  Oh, my treasure was ne&rsquo;er in the gift of man;<br>
  For the gods have given me Emily Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo;  said they, &ldquo;O you crazy Sym.<br>
  Roses perish, and eyes grow dim.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lustre fades from the fairest hair.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who weds a woman links arms with care.<br>
  But women there are in the city of Gosh&mdash;<br>
  Ay, even the daughters of good King Splosh . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Care,&rdquo;  said Sym, &ldquo;is a weed that springs<br>
  Even to-day in the gardens of kings.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, who have lived &rsquo;neath the tent of the
  skies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know of the flowers, and which to prize . . .<br>
  Give you good even!&nbsp;&nbsp;For now I must jog.&rdquo;<br>
  And he whistled him once to his little red dog.</p>
<p>Into the meadow and over the stile,<br>
  Off went the tinker man, singing the while;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down by the bracken patch, over the hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the little red dog at the heel of him still.<br>
  And back, as he soberly sauntered along,<br>
  There came to the riders the tail of his song.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Kettles and pots!&nbsp;&nbsp;Kettles and pans!<br>
  Strong is my arm if the cause it be man&rsquo;s.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a fig for the cause of a cunning old king;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Emily Ann will be mine in the Spring.<br>
  Then nought shall I labour for Splosh or his plans;<br>
  Tho&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll mend him a kettle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho, kettles and pans!&rdquo;</i></p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="12TheLittleRedDog"></a>12. The Little Red Dog</b></h2>
<p>The Glugs still live in the land of Gosh,<br>
  Under the rule of the great King Splosh.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees in the Summer and Spring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is reckoned the regular thing.<br>
  Down in the valley they live their lives,<br>
  Taking the air with their aunts and wives.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they climb the trees in the Winter and Fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And count it improper to climb not at all.</p>
<p>And they name their trees with a thousand names,<br>
  Calling them after their Arts and Aims;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some, they climb for the fun of the thing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most go up at the call of the King.<br>
  Some scale a tree that they fear to name,<br>
  For it bears great blossoms of scarlet shame.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they eat of the fruit of the nameless tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are Glugs, and their choice is free.</p>
<p>But every eve, when the sun goes West,<br>
  Over the mountain they call The Blest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose summit looks down on the city of Gosh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the reach of the great King Splosh,<br>
  The Glugs gaze up at the heights above,<br>
  And feel vague promptings to wondrous love.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they whisper a tale of a tinker man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lives in the mount with his Emily Ann.</p>
<p>A great mother mountain, and kindly is she,<br>
  Who nurses young rivers and sends them to sea.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, nestled high up on her sheltering lap,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a little red house with a little straw cap<br>
  That bears a blue feather of smoke, curling high,<br>
  And a bunch of red roses cocked over one eye.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the eyes of it glisten and shine in the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they look down on Gosh with a twinkle of fun.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gay little garden, a tidy white gate,<br>
  And a narrow brown pathway that will not run straight;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it turns and it twists and it wanders about<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the left and the right, as in humorous doubt.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a humorous path, and a joke from its birth<br>
  Till it ends at the door with a wriggle of mirth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here in the mount lives the queer tinker man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his little red dog and his Emily Arm.</p>
<p>And, once in a while, when the weather is clear,<br>
  When the work is all over, and even is near,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walk in the garden and gaze down below<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Valley of Gosh, where the young rivers go;<br>
  Where the houses of Gosh seem so paltry and vain,<br>
  Like a handful of pebbles strewn over the plain;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where tiny black forms crawl about in the vale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stare at the mountain they fear them to scale.</p>
<p>And Sym sits him down by his little wife&rsquo;s knee,<br>
  With his feet in the grass and his back to a tree;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he looks on the Valley and dreams of old years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he strokes his red dog with the funny prick ears.<br>
  And he says, &ldquo;Still they climb in their whimsical way,<br>
  While we stand on earth, yet are higher than they.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, who trusts to a tree is a fool of a man!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wise seek the mountains, my Emily Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So lives the queer tinker, nor deems it a wrong,<br>
  When the spirit so moves him, to burst into song.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis a comical song about kettles and pans,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the graces and charms that are Emily Ann&rsquo;s.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a mad, freakish song, but he sings it with zest,<br>
  And his little wife vows it of all songs the best.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sings quite a lot, as the Summer days pass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his back to a tree and his feet in the grass.</p>
<p>And the little red dog, who is wise as dogs go,<br>
  He will hark to that song for a minute or so,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his head on one side, and a serious air.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he makes no remark; but he wanders elsewhere.<br>
  And he trots down the garden to gaze now and then<br>
  At the curious pranks of a certain blue wren:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a commonplace wren, but a bird marked for fame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro&rsquo; a grievance in life and a definite aim.</p>
<p>Now, they never fly far and they never fly high,<br>
  And they probably couldn&rsquo;t, suppose they should try.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the common blue wren is content with his lot:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will eat when there&rsquo;s food, and he fasts when
  there&rsquo;s not.<br>
  He flirts and he flutters, his wife by his side,<br>
  With his share of content and forgiveable pride.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he keeps to the earth, &rsquo;mid the bushes and
  shrubs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he dines very well upon corpulent grubs.</p>
<p>But the little blue wren with a grievance in life,<br>
  He was rude to his neighbours and short with his wife.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, up in the apple-tree over his nest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There dwelt a fat spider who gave him no rest:<br>
  A spider so fat, so abnormally stout<br>
  That he seemed hardly fitted to waddle about.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his eyes were so sharp, and his legs were so spry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he could not be caught; and &rsquo;twas folly
  to try.</p>
<p>Said the wren, as his loud lamentations he hurled<br>
  At the little red dog, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rotten old world!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my heart would be glad, and my life would be blest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had that fat spider well under my vest.<br>
  Then I&rsquo;d call back my youth, and be seeking to live,<br>
  And to taste of the pleasures the world has to give.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world is all wrong, and my mind&rsquo;s in
  a fog!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t be a Glug!&rdquo; said the little
  red dog.</p>
<p>Then, up from the grass, where he sat by his tree,<br>
  The voice of the Tinker rose fearless and free.</p>
<p>The little dog listened, his head on one side;<br>
  Then sought him a spot where a bored dog could hide.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Kettles and pans!&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho, kettles and pans!<br>
  The stars are the gods&rsquo; but the earth, it is man&rsquo;s!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet down in the shadow dull mortals there are<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who climb in the tree-tops to snatch at a star:<br>
  Seeking content and a surcease of care,<br>
  Finding but emptiness everywhere.<br>
  </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Then make for the mountain, importunate man!<br>
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>With a kettle to mend . . . and your Emily Ann.</i></p>
<p>As he cocked a sad eye o&rsquo;er a sheltering log,<br>
&ldquo;Oh, a Glug <i>is</i> a Glug!&rdquo; sighed the little red dog.</p>
