<p>On the diggings up to twenty odd years ago&mdash;and as far back
as I can remember&mdash;on Lambing Flat, the Pipe Clays, Gulgong,
Home Rule, and so through the roaring list; in bark huts, tents,
public-houses, sly grog shanties, and&mdash;well, the most glorious
voice of all belonged to a bad girl. We were only children and
didn&rsquo;t know why she was bad, but we weren&rsquo;t allowed to
play near or go near the hut she lived in, and we were trained to
believe firmly that something awful would happen to us if we stayed
to answer a word, and didn&rsquo;t run away as fast as our legs
could carry us, if she attempted to speak to us. We had before us
the dread example of one urchin, who got an awful hiding and went
on bread and water for twenty-four hours for allowing her to kiss
him and give him lollies. She didn&rsquo;t look bad &mdash; she
looked to us like a grand and beautiful lady-girl&mdash; but we got
instilled into us the idea that she was an awful bad woman,
something more terrible even than a drunken man, and one whose
presence was to be feared and fled from. There were two other girls
in the hut with her, also a pretty little girl, who called her
&ldquo;Auntie&rdquo;, and with whom we were not allowed to
play&mdash;for they were all bad; which puzzled us as much as
child-minds can be puzzled. We couldn&rsquo;t make out how
everybody in one house could be bad. We used to wonder why these
bad people weren&rsquo;t hunted away or put in gaol if they were so
bad. And another thing puzzled us. Slipping out after dark, when
the bad girls happened to be singing in their house, we&rsquo;d
sometimes run against men hanging round the hut by ones and twos
and threes, listening. They seemed mysterious. They were mostly
good men, and we concluded they were listening and watching the bad
women&rsquo;s house to see that they didn&rsquo;t kill anyone, or
steal and run away with any bad little boys &mdash; ourselves, for
instance&mdash;who ran out after dark; which, as we were informed,
those bad people were always on the lookout for a chance to do.</p>

<p>We were told in after years that old Peter McKenzie (a
respectable, married, hard-working digger) would sometimes steal up
opposite the bad door in the dark, and throw in money done up in a
piece of paper, and listen round until the bad girl had sung the
&ldquo;Bonnie Hills of Scotland&rdquo; two or three times. Then
he&rsquo;d go and get drunk, and stay drunk two or three days at a
time. And his wife caught him throwing the money in one night, and
there was a terrible row, and she left him; and people always said
it was all a mistake. But we couldn&rsquo;t see the mistake
then.</p>

<p>But I can hear that girl&rsquo;s voice through the night, twenty
years ago:</p>

<p class="note">Oh! the bloomin&rsquo; heath, and the pale blue
bell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my bonnet then I wore;<br>
And memory knows no brighter theme<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than those happy days of yore.<br>
Scotland! Land of chief and song!<br>
Oh, what charms to thee belong!</p>

<p>And I am old enough to understand why poor Peter McKenzie
&mdash; who was married to a Saxon, and a Tartar&mdash;went and got
drunk when the bad girl sang &ldquo;The Bonnie Hills of
Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">His anxious eye might look in vain<br>
For some loved form it knew!</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And yet another thing puzzled us greatly at the time. Next door
to the bad girl&rsquo;s house there lived a very respectable
family&mdash; a family of good girls with whom we were allowed to
play, and from whom we got lollies (those hard old red-and-white
&ldquo;fish lollies&rdquo; that grocers sent home with parcels of
groceries and receipted bills). Now one washing day, they being as
glad to get rid of us at home as we were to get out, we went over
to the good house and found no one at home except the grown-up
daughter, who used to sing for us, and read &ldquo;<i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>&rdquo; of nights, &ldquo;out loud&rdquo;, and give us
more lollies than any of the rest&mdash;and with whom we were
passionately in love, notwithstanding the fact that she was engaged
to a &ldquo;grown-up man&rdquo;&mdash; (we reckoned he&rsquo;d be
dead and out of the way by the time we were old enough to marry
her). She was washing. She had carried the stool and tub over
against the stick fence which separated her house from the bad
house; and, to our astonishment and dismay, the bad girl had
brought <i>her</i> tub over against her side of the fence. They
stood and worked with their shoulders to the fence between them,
and heads bent down close to it. The bad girl would sing a few
words, and the good girl after her, over and over again. They sang
very low, we thought. Presently the good grown-up girl turned her
head and caught sight of us. She jumped, and her face went flaming
red; she laid hold of the stool and carried it, tub and all, away
from that fence in a hurry. And the bad grown-up girl took her tub
back to her house. The good grown-up girl made us promise never to
tell what we saw &mdash; that she&rsquo;d been talking to a bad
girl&mdash;else she would never, never marry us.</p>

<p>She told me, in after years, when she&rsquo;d grown up to be a
grandmother, that the bad girl was surreptitiously teaching her to
sing &ldquo;Madeline&rdquo; that day.</p>

<p>I remember a dreadful story of a digger who went and shot
himself one night after hearing that bad girl sing. We thought then
what a frightfully bad woman she must be. The incident terrified
us; and thereafter we kept carefully and fearfully out of reach of
her voice, lest we should go and do what the digger did.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I have a dreamy recollection of a circus on Gulgong in the
roaring days, more than twenty years ago, and a woman (to my
child-fancy a being from another world) standing in the middle of
the ring, singing:</p>

<p class="note">Out in the cold world&mdash;out in the
street&mdash;<br>
Asking a penny from each one I meet;<br>
Cheerless I wander about all the day,<br>
Wearing my young life in sorrow away!</p>

<p>That last line haunted me for many years. I remember being
frightened by women sobbing (and one or two great grown-up diggers
also) that night in that circus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, Dear Father, Come Home with Me Now&rdquo;, was a
sacred song then, not a peg for vulgar parodies and more vulgar
&ldquo;business&rdquo; for fourth-rate clowns and corner-men. Then
there was &ldquo;The Prairie Flower&rdquo;. &ldquo;Out on the
Prairie, in an Early Day&rdquo;&mdash;I can hear the digger&rsquo;s
wife yet: she was the prettiest girl on the field. They married on
the sly and crept into camp after dark; but the diggers got wind of
it and rolled up with gold-dishes, shovels, &amp;c., &amp;c., and
gave them a real good tinkettling in the old-fashioned style, and a
nugget or two to start housekeeping on. She had a very sweet
voice.</p>

<p class="note">Fair as a lily, joyous and free,<br>
Light of the prairie home was she.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s a &ldquo;granny&rdquo; now, no doubt&mdash;or
dead.</p>

<p>And I remember a poor, brutally ill-used little wife, wearing a
black eye mostly, and singing &ldquo;Love Amongst the Roses&rdquo;
at her work. And they sang the &ldquo;Blue Tail Fly&rdquo;, and all
the first and best coon songs&mdash; in the days when old John
Brown sank a duffer on the hill.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The great bark kitchen of Granny Mathews&rsquo; &ldquo;Redclay
Inn&rdquo;. A fresh back-log thrown behind the fire, which lights
the room fitfully. Company settled down to pipes, subdued yarning,
and reverie.</p>

<p>Flash Jack&mdash;red sash, cabbage-tree hat on back of head with
nothing in it, glossy black curls bunched up in front of brim.
Flash Jack volunteers, without invitation, preparation, or warning,
and through his nose:</p>

<p class="note">Hoh!&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">There was a wild kerlonial youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Dowlin was his name!<br>
He bountied on his parients,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lived in Castlemaine!</p>

<p>and so on to&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">He took a pistol from his breast<br>
And waved that lit&mdash;tle toy&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little toy&rdquo; with an enthusiastic flourish and great
unction on Flash Jack&rsquo;s part&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight, but I won&rsquo;t
surrender!&rdquo; said<br>
The wild Kerlonial Boy.</p>

<p>Even this fails to rouse the company&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Give us a song, Abe! Give us the
&lsquo;Lowlands&rsquo;!&rdquo; Abe Mathews, bearded and grizzled,
is lying on the broad of his back on a bench, with his hands
clasped under his head&mdash; his favourite position for smoking,
reverie, yarning, or singing. He had a strong, deep voice, which
used to thrill me through and through, from hair to toenails, as a
child.</p>

<p>They bother Abe till he takes his pipe out of his mouth and puts
it behind his head on the end of the stool:</p>

<p class="note">The ship was built in Glasgow;<br>
&rsquo;Twas the &ldquo;Golden Vanitee&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lines have dropped out of my memory during the thirty years gone
between&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">And she ploughed in the Low Lands, Low!</p>

<p>The public-house people and more diggers drop into the kitchen,
as all do within hearing, when Abe sings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, boys:</p>

<p class="note">And she ploughed in the Low Lands, Low!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, all together!</p>

<p class="note">The Low Lands! The Low Lands!<br>
And she ploughed in the Low Lands, Low!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toe and heel and flat of foot begin to stamp the clay floor, and
horny hands to slap patched knees in accompaniment.</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Oh! save me, lads!&rdquo; he cried,<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m drifting with the current,<br>
And I&rsquo;m drifting with the tide!<br>
And I&rsquo;m sinking in the Low Lands, Low!<br>
The Low Lands! The Low Lands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old bark kitchen is a-going now. Heels drumming on gin-cases
under stools; hands, knuckles, pipe-bowls, and pannikins keeping
time on the table.</p>

<p class="note">And we sewed him in his hammock,<br>
And we slipped him o&rsquo;er the side,<br>
And we sunk him in the Low Lands, Low!<br>
The Low Lands! The Low Lands!<br>
And we sunk him in the Low Lands, Low!</p>

<p>Old Boozer Smith&mdash;a dirty gin-sodden bundle of rags on the
floor in the corner with its head on a candle box, and covered by a
horse rug&mdash; old Boozer Smith is supposed to have been dead to
the universe for hours past, but the chorus must have disturbed his
torpor; for, with a suddenness and unexpectedness that makes the
next man jump, there comes a bellow from under the horse rug:</p>

<p class="note">Wot though!&mdash;I wear!&mdash;a rag!&mdash;ged
coat!<br>
I&rsquo;ll wear it like a man!</p>

<p>and ceases as suddenly as it commenced. He struggles to bring
his ruined head and bloated face above the surface, glares round;
then, no one questioning his manhood, he sinks back and dies to
creation; and subsequent proceedings are only interrupted by a
snore, as far as he is concerned.</p>

<p>Little Jimmy Nowlett, the bullock-driver, is inspired. &ldquo;Go
on, Jimmy! Give us a song!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">In the days when we were hard up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of wood and wire&mdash;</p>

<p>Jimmy always blunders; it should have been &ldquo;<i>food and
fire</i>&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">We used to tie our boots up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lit&mdash;tle bits&mdash;er wire;</p>

<p>and&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">I&rsquo;m sitting in my lit&mdash;tle room,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It measures six by six;<br>
The work-house wall is opposite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve counted all the bricks!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us a chorus, Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy does, giving his head a short, jerky nod for nearly every
word, and describing a circle round his crown&mdash;as if he were
stirring a pint of hot tea&mdash;with his forefinger, at the end of
every line:</p>

<p class="note">Hall!&mdash;Round!&mdash;Me&mdash;Hat!<br>
I wore a weepin&rsquo; willer!</p>

<p>Jimmy is a Cockney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">Hall&mdash;round&mdash;me hat!</p>

<p>How many old diggers remember it?</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p class="note">A butcher, and a baker, and a quiet-looking
quaker,<br>
All a-courting pretty Jessie at the Railway Bar.</p>

<p>I used to wonder as a child what the &ldquo;railway bar&rdquo;
meant.</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p class="note">I would, I would, I would in vain<br>
That I were single once again!<br>
But ah, alas, that will not be<br>
Till apples grow on the willow tree.</p>

<p>A drunken gambler&rsquo;s young wife used to sing that
song&mdash;to herself.</p>

<p>A stir at the kitchen door, and a cry of &ldquo;Pinter,&rdquo;
and old Poynton, Ballarat digger, appears and is shoved in; he has
several drinks aboard, and they proceed to &ldquo;git Pinter on the
singin&rsquo; lay,&rdquo; and at last talk him round. He has a good
voice, but no &ldquo;theory&rdquo;, and blunders worse than Jimmy
Nowlett with the words. He starts with a howl&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">Hoh!<br>
Way down in Covent Gar-ar-r-dings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-strolling I did go,<br>
To see the sweetest flow-ow-wers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That e&rsquo;er in gardings grow.</p>

<p>He saw the rose and lily&mdash;the red and white and blue&mdash;
and he saw the sweetest flow-ow-ers that e&rsquo;er in gardings
grew; for he saw two lovely maidens (Pinter calls &rsquo;em
&ldquo;virgings&rdquo;) underneath (he must have meant on top of)
&ldquo;<i>a garding chair</i>&rdquo;, sings Pinter.</p>

<p class="note">And one was lovely Jessie,<br>
With the jet black eyes and hair,</p>

<p>roars Pinter,</p>

<p class="note">And the other was a vir-ir-ging,<br>
I solemn-lye declare!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maiden, Pinter!&rdquo; interjects Mr. Nowlett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; retorts Pinter.
&ldquo;A maiden <i>is</i> a virging, Jimmy. If you&rsquo;re
singing, Jimmy, and not me, I&rsquo;ll leave off!&rdquo; Chorus of
&ldquo;Order! Shut up, Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">I quicklye step-ped up to her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto her did sa-a-y:<br>
Do you belong to any young man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoh, tell me that, I pra-a-y?</p>

<p>Her answer, according to Pinter, was surprisingly prompt and
unconventional; also full and concise:</p>

<p class="note">No; I belong to no young man&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I solemnlye declare!<br>
I mean to live a virging<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still my laurels wear!</p>

<p>Jimmy Nowlett attempts to move an amendment in favour of
&ldquo;maiden&rdquo;, but is promptly suppressed. It seems that
Pinter&rsquo;s suit has a happy termination, for he is supposed to
sing in the character of a &ldquo;Sailor Bold&rdquo;, and as he
turns to pursue his stroll in &ldquo;Covent
Gar-ar-dings&rdquo;:</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!&rdquo; she
cried,<br>
&ldquo;I love a Sailor Bold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hong-kore, Pinter! Give us the &lsquo;Golden
Glove&rsquo;, Pinter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus warmed up, Pinter starts with an explanatory
&ldquo;spoken&rdquo; to the effect that the song he is about to
sing illustrates some of the little ways of woman, and how, no
matter what you say or do, she is bound to have her own way in the
end; also how, in one instance, she set about getting it.</p>

<p class="note">Hoh!<br>
Now, it&rsquo;s of a young squoire near Timworth did dwell,<br>
Who courted a nobleman&rsquo;s daughter so well&mdash;</p>

<p>The song has little or nothing to do with the
&ldquo;squire&rdquo;, except so far as &ldquo;all friends and
relations had given consent,&rdquo; and&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">The troo-soo was ordered&mdash;appointed the
day,<br>
And a farmer were appointed for to give her away&mdash;</p>

<p>which last seemed a most unusual proceeding, considering the
wedding was a toney affair; but perhaps there were personal
interests&mdash; the nobleman might have been hard up, and the
farmer backing him. But there was an extraordinary scene in the
church, and things got mixed.</p>

<p class="note">For as soon as this maiding this farmer espied:<br>
&ldquo;Hoh, my heart! Hoh, my heart!<br>
&ldquo;Hoh, my heart!&rdquo; then she cried.</p>

<p>Hysterics? Anyway, instead of being wed&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">This maiden took sick and she went to her bed.</p>

<p>(N.B.&mdash; Pinter sticks to &lsquo;<i>virging</i>&rsquo;.)</p>

<p>Whereupon friends and relations and guests left the house in a
body (a strange but perhaps a wise proceeding, after
all&mdash;maybe they smelt a rat) and left her to recover alone,
which she did promptly. And then:</p>

<p class="note">Shirt, breeches, and waistcoat this maiding put
on,<br>
And a-hunting she went with her dog and her gun;<br>
She hunted all round where this farmier did dwell,<br>
Because in her own heart she love-ed him well.</p>

<p>The cat&rsquo;s out of the bag now:</p>

<p class="note">And often she fired, but no game she
killed&mdash;</p>

<p>which was not surprising&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">Till at last the young farmier came into the
field&mdash;</p>

<p>No wonder. She put it to him straight:</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, why are you not at the wedding?&rdquo;
she cried,<br>
&ldquo;For to wait on the squoire, and to give him his
bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was as prompt and as delightfully unconventional in his reply
as the young lady in Covent Gardings:</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, no! and oh, no! For the truth I must
sa-a-y,<br>
I love her too well for to give her a-w-a-a-y!&rdquo;</p>

<p>which was satisfactory to the disguised
&ldquo;virging&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;. . . . and I&rsquo;d take sword in
hand,<br>
And by honour I&rsquo;d win her if she would command.&rdquo;</p>

bold,<br>
She gave him her glove that was flowered with gold,</p>

<p>and explained that she found it in his field while hunting
around with her dog and her gun. It is understood that he promised
to look up the owner. Then she went home and put an advertisement
in the local&nbsp;<i>Herald</i>; and that ad. must have caused
considerable sensation. She stated that she had lost her golden
glove, and</p>

<p class="note">The young man that finds it and brings it to
me,<br>
Hoh! that very young man my husband shall be!</p>

<p>She had a saving clause in case the young farmer mislaid the
glove before he saw the ad., and an <i>old</i> bloke got holt of it
and fetched it along. But everything went all right. The young
farmer turned up with the glove. He was a very respectable young
farmer, and expressed his gratitude to her for having
&ldquo;<i>honour-ed him with her love.</i>&rdquo; They were
married, and the song ends with a picture of the young farmeress
milking the cow, and the young farmer going whistling to plough.
The fact that they lived and grafted on the selection proves that I
hit the right nail on the head when I guessed, in the first place,
that the old nobleman was &ldquo;stony&rdquo;.</p>

How she hunted him up with her dog and her gun.</p>

of matrimonial experiences, the old song doesn&rsquo;t say, for it
ends there.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AVisionofSandyBlight" id=
"AVisionofSandyBlight"></a>A Vision of Sandy Blight</b>
</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d been humping my back, and crouching and groaning for
an hour or so in the darkest corner of the travellers&rsquo; hut,
tortured by the demon of sandy blight. It was too hot to travel,
and there was no one there except ourselves and Mitchell&rsquo;s
cattle pup. We were waiting till after sundown, for I
couldn&rsquo;t have travelled in the daylight, anyway. Mitchell had
tied a wet towel round my eyes, and led me for the last mile or two
by another towel&mdash; one end fastened to his belt behind, and
the other in my hand as I walked in his tracks. And oh! but this
was a relief! It was out of the dust and glare, and the flies
didn&rsquo;t come into the dark hut, and I could hump and stick my
knees in my eyes and groan in comfort. I didn&rsquo;t want a
thousand a year, or anything; I only wanted relief for my eyes
&mdash;that was all I prayed for in this world. When the sun got
down a bit, Mitchell started poking round, and presently he found
amongst the rubbish a dirty-looking medicine bottle, corked tight;
when he rubbed the dirt off a piece of notepaper that was pasted
on, he saw &ldquo;eye-water&rdquo; written on it. He drew the cork
with his teeth, smelt the water, stuck his little finger in, turned
the bottle upside down, tasted the top of his finger, and reckoned
the stuff was all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Wake up, Joe!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bottle of tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bottler wot?&rdquo; I groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eye-water,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t
want to be poisoned or have my eyes burnt out by mistake; perhaps
some burning acid had got into that bottle, or the label had been
put on, or left on, in mistake or carelessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s
no harm in tryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I chanced it. I lay down on my back in a bunk, and Mitchell
dragged my lids up and spilt half a bottle of eye-water over my
eye-balls.</p>

<p>The relief was almost instantaneous. I never experienced such a
quick cure in my life. I carried the bottle in my swag for a long
time afterwards, with an idea of getting it analysed, but left it
behind at last in a camp.</p>

<p>Mitchell scratched his head thoughtfully, and watched me for a
while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait a bit longer,&rdquo; he said at
last, &ldquo;and if it doesn&rsquo;t blind you I&rsquo;ll put some
in my eyes. I&rsquo;m getting a touch of blight myself now.
That&rsquo;s the fault of travelling with a mate who&rsquo;s always
catching something that&rsquo;s no good to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it grew dark outside we talked of sandy-blight and fly-bite,
and sand-flies up north, and ordinary flies, and branched off to
Barcoo rot, and struck the track again at bees and bee stings. When
we got to bees, Mitchell sat smoking for a while and looking
dreamily backwards along tracks and branch tracks, and round
corners and circles he had travelled, right back to the short,
narrow, innocent bit of track that ends in a vague, misty
point&mdash;like the end of a long, straight, cleared road in the
moonlight&mdash;as far back as we can remember.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had about fourteen hives,&rdquo; said
Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;we used to call them &lsquo;swarms&rsquo;, no
matter whether they were flying or in the box&mdash;when I left
home first time. I kept them behind the shed, in the shade, on
tables of galvanised iron cases turned down on stakes; but I had to
make legs later on, and stand them in pans of water, on account of
the ants. When the bees swarmed&mdash;and some hives sent out the
Lord knows how many swarms in a year, it seemed to me&mdash;
we&rsquo;d tin-kettle &rsquo;em, and throw water on &rsquo;em, to
make &rsquo;em believe the biggest thunderstorm was coming to drown
the oldest inhabitant; and, if they didn&rsquo;t get the start of
us and rise, they&rsquo;d settle on a branch&mdash; generally on
one of the scraggy fruit trees. It was rough on the bees&mdash;
come to think of it; their instinct told them it was going to be
fine, and the noise and water told them it was raining. They must
have thought that nature was mad, drunk, or gone ratty, or the end
of the world had come. We&rsquo;d rig up a table, with a box upside
down, under the branch, cover our face with a piece of mosquito
net, have rags burning round, and then give the branch a sudden
jerk, turn the box down, and run. If we got most of the bees in,
the rest that were hanging to the bough or flying round would
follow, and then we reckoned we&rsquo;d shook the queen in. If the
bees in the box came out and joined the others, we&rsquo;d reckon
we hadn&rsquo;t shook the queen in, and go for them again. When a
hive was full of honey we&rsquo;d turn the box upside down, turn
the empty box mouth down on top of it, and drum and hammer on the
lower box with a stick till all the bees went up into the top box.
I suppose it made their heads ache, and they went up on that
account.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose things are done differently on proper
bee-farms. I&rsquo;ve heard that a bee-farmer will part a hanging
swarm with his fingers, take out the queen bee and arrange matters
with her; but our ways suited us, and there was a lot of
expectation and running and excitement in it, especially when a
swarm took us by surprise. The yell of &lsquo;Bees
swarmin&rsquo;!&rsquo; was as good to us as the yell of
&lsquo;Fight!&rsquo; is now, or &lsquo;Bolt!&rsquo; in town, or
&lsquo;Fire&rsquo; or &lsquo;Man overboard!&rsquo; at sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was tons of honey. The bees used to go to the
vineyards at wine-making and get honey from the heaps of crushed
grape-skins thrown out in the sun, and get so drunk sometimes that
they wobbled in their bee-lines home. They&rsquo;d fill all the
boxes, and then build in between and under the bark, and board, and
tin covers. They never seemed to get the idea out of their heads
that this wasn&rsquo;t an evergreen country, and it wasn&rsquo;t
going to snow all winter. My younger brother Joe used to put pieces
of meat on the tables near the boxes, and in front of the holes
where the bees went in and out, for the dogs to grab at. But one
old dog, &lsquo;Black Bill&rsquo;, was a match for him; if it was
worth Bill&rsquo;s while, he&rsquo;d camp there, and keep Joe and
the other dogs from touching the meat&mdash;once it was put
down&mdash;till the bees turned in for the night. And Joe would get
the other kids round there, and when they weren&rsquo;t looking or
thinking, he&rsquo;d brush the bees with a stick and run. I&rsquo;d
lam him when I caught him at it. He was an awful young devil, was
Joe, and he grew up steady, and respectable, and
respected&mdash;and I went to the bad. I never trust a good boy
now. . . . Ah, well!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember the first swarm we got. We&rsquo;d been
talking of getting a few swarms for a long time. That was what was
the matter with us English and Irish and English-Irish Australian
farmers: we used to talk so much about doing things while the
Germans and Scotch did them. And we even talked in a lazy,
easy-going sort of way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one blazing hot day I saw father coming along the
road, home to dinner (we had it in the middle of the day), with his
axe over his shoulder. I noticed the axe particularly because
father was bringing it home to grind, and Joe and I had to turn the
stone; but, when I noticed Joe dragging along home in the dust
about fifty yards behind father, I felt easier in my mind. Suddenly
father dropped the axe and started to run back along the road
towards Joe, who, as soon as he saw father coming, shied for the
fence and got through. He thought he was going to catch it for
something he&rsquo;d done&mdash;or hadn&rsquo;t done. Joe used to
do so many things and leave so many things not done that he could
never be sure of father. Besides, father had a way of starting to
hammer us unexpectedly&mdash; when the idea struck him. But father
pulled himself up in about thirty yards and started to grab up
handfuls of dust and sand and throw them into the air. My idea, in
the first flash, was to get hold of the axe, for I thought it was
sun-stroke, and father might take it into his head to start
chopping up the family before I could persuade him to put it (his
head, I mean) in a bucket of water. But Joe came running like mad,
yelling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Swarmer&mdash;bees!
Swawmmer&mdash;bee&mdash;ee&mdash;es!
Bring&mdash;a&mdash;tin&mdash;dish&mdash;
and&mdash;a&mdash;dippera&mdash;wa-a-ter!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ran with a bucket of water and an old frying-pan, and
pretty soon the rest of the family were on the spot, throwing dust
and water, and banging everything, tin or iron, they could get hold
of. The only bullock bell in the district (if it was in the
district) was on the old poley cow, and she&rsquo;d been lost for a
fortnight. Mother brought up the rear&mdash;but soon worked to the
front&mdash; with a baking-dish and a big spoon. The old
lady&mdash;she wasn&rsquo;t old then&mdash; had a deep-rooted
prejudice that she could do everything better than anybody else,
and that the selection and all on it would go to the dogs if she
wasn&rsquo;t there to look after it. There was no jolting that idea
out of her. She not only believed that she could do anything better
than anybody, and hers was the only right or possible way, and that
we&rsquo;d do everything upside down if she wasn&rsquo;t there to
do it or show us how&mdash;but she&rsquo;d try to do things herself
or insist on making us do them her way, and that led to messes and
rows. She was excited now, and took command at once. She
wasn&rsquo;t tongue-tied, and had no impediment in her speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t throw up dust!&mdash;Stop throwing up
dust!&mdash; Do you want to smother &rsquo;em?&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
throw up so much water!&mdash; Only throw up a pannikin at a
time!&mdash;D&rsquo;yer want to drown &rsquo;em? Bang! Keep on
banging, Joe!&mdash;Look at that child! Run, someone!&mdash;run!
you, Jack!&mdash;D&rsquo;yer want the child to be stung to
death?&mdash;Take her inside! . . . Dy&rsquo; hear me? . . . Stop
throwing up dust, Tom! [To father.] You&rsquo;re scaring &rsquo;em
away! Can&rsquo;t you see they want to settle?&rsquo; [Father was
getting mad and yelping: &lsquo;For Godsake shettup and go
inside.&rsquo;] &lsquo;Throw up water, Jack! Throw up&mdash;Tom!
Take that bucket from him and don&rsquo;t make such a fool of
yourself before the children! Throw up water! Throw&mdash;keep on
banging, children! Keep on banging!&rsquo; [Mother put her faith in
banging.] &lsquo;There!&mdash;they&rsquo;re off! You&rsquo;ve lost
&rsquo;em! I knew you would! I told yer&mdash;keep on
bang&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bee struck her in the eye, and she grabbed at it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother went home&mdash;and inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father was good at bees&mdash;could manage them like
sheep when he got to know their ideas. When the swarm settled, he
sent us for the old washing stool, boxes, bags, and so on; and the
whole time he was fixing the bees I noticed that whenever his back
was turned to us his shoulders would jerk up as if he was cold, and
he seemed to shudder from inside, and now and then I&rsquo;d hear a
grunting sort of whimper like a boy that was just starting to
blubber. But father wasn&rsquo;t weeping, and bees weren&rsquo;t
stinging him; it was the bee that stung mother that was tickling
father. When he went into the house, mother&rsquo;s other eye had
bunged for sympathy. Father was always gentle and kind in sickness,
and he bathed mother&rsquo;s eyes and rubbed mud on, but every now
and then he&rsquo;d catch inside, and jerk and shudder, and grunt
and cough. Mother got wild, but presently the humour of it struck
her, and she had to laugh, and a rum laugh it was, with both eyes
bunged up. Then she got hysterical, and started to cry, and father
put his arm round her shoulder and ordered us out of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were very fond of each other, the old people were,
under it all&mdash;right up to the end. . . . Ah, well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell pulled the swags out of a bunk, and started to fasten
the nose-bags on.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AndyPagesRival" id=

</h2>

<p class="note">Tall and freckled and sandy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face of a country lout;<br>
That was the picture of Andy&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middleton&rsquo;s rouseabout.<br>
On Middleton's wide dominions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plied the stock-whip and shears;<br>
Hadn&rsquo;t any opinions&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And he hadn&rsquo;t any &ldquo;ideers&rdquo;&mdash;at least, he
said so himself&mdash; except as regarded anything that looked to
him like what he called &ldquo;funny business&rdquo;, under which
heading he catalogued tyranny, treachery, interference with the
liberty of the subject by the subject, &ldquo;blanky&rdquo; lies,
or swindles&mdash;all things, in short, that seemed to his slow
understanding dishonest, mean or paltry; most especially, and above
all, treachery to a mate. <i>That</i> he could never forget. Andy
was uncomfortably &ldquo;straight&rdquo;. His mind worked slowly
and his decisions were, as a rule, right and just; and when he once
came to a conclusion concerning any man or matter, or decided upon
a course of action, nothing short of an earthquake or a Nevertire
cyclone could move him back an inch&mdash;unless a conviction were
severely shaken, and then he would require as much time to
&ldquo;back&rdquo; to his starting point as he did to come to the
decision.</p>

<p>Andy had come to a conclusion with regard to a selector&rsquo;s
daughter&mdash;name, Lizzie Porter&mdash;who lived (and slaved) on
her father&rsquo;s selection, near the township corner of the run
on which Andy was a general &ldquo;hand&rdquo;. He had been in the
habit for several years of calling casually at the selector&rsquo;s
house, as he rode to and fro between the station and the town, to
get a drink of water and exchange the time of day with old Porter
and his &ldquo;missus&rdquo;. The conversation concerned the
drought, and the likelihood or otherwise of their ever going to get
a little rain; or about Porter&rsquo;s cattle, with an occasional
enquiry concerning, or reference to, a stray cow belonging to the
selection, but preferring the run; a little, plump, saucy, white
cow, by-the-way, practically pure white, but referred to by
Andy&mdash;who had eyes like a blackfellow&mdash;as &ldquo;old
Speckledy&rdquo;. No one else could detect a spot or speckle on her
at a casual glance. Then after a long bovine silence, which would
have been painfully embarrassing in any other society, and a
tilting of his cabbage-tree hat forward, which came of tickling and
scratching the sun-blotched nape of his neck with his little
finger, Andy would slowly say: &ldquo;Ah, well. I must be
gettin&rsquo;. So-long, Mr. Porter. So-long, Mrs. Porter.&rdquo;
And, if <i>she</i> were in evidence &mdash;as she generally was on
such occasions&mdash;&ldquo;So-long, Lizzie.&rdquo; And
they&rsquo;d shout: &ldquo;So-long, Andy,&rdquo; as he galloped off
from the jump. Strange that those shy, quiet, gentle-voiced bushmen
seem the hardest and most reckless riders.</p>

<p>But of late his horse had been seen hanging up outside
Porter&rsquo;s for an hour or so after sunset. He smoked, talked
over the results of the last drought (if it happened to rain), and
the possibilities of the next one, and played cards with old
Porter; who took to winking, automatically, at his &ldquo;old
woman&rdquo;, and nudging, and jerking his thumb in the direction
of Lizzie when her back was turned, and Andy was scratching the
nape of his neck and staring at the cards.</p>

<p>Lizzie told a lady friend of mine, years afterwards, how Andy
popped the question; told it in her quiet way&mdash;you know
Lizzie&rsquo;s quiet way (something of the old, privileged
house-cat about her); never a sign in expression or tone to show
whether she herself saw or appreciated the humour of anything she
was telling, no matter how comical it might be. She had witnessed
two tragedies, and had found a dead man in the bush, and related
the incidents as though they were common-place.</p>

<p>It happened one day&mdash;after Andy had been coming two or
three times a week for about a year&mdash;that she found herself
sitting with him on a log of the woodheap, in the cool of the
evening, enjoying the sunset breeze. Andy&rsquo;s arm had got round
her&mdash; just as it might have gone round a post he happened to
be leaning against. They hadn&rsquo;t been talking about anything
in particular. Andy said he wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they had
a thunderstorm before mornin&rsquo;&mdash; it had been so
smotherin&rsquo; hot all day.</p>

<p>Lizzie said, &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy smoked a good while, then he said: &ldquo;Ah, well!
It&rsquo;s a weary world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lizzie didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>

<p>By-and-bye Andy said: &ldquo;Ah, well; it&rsquo;s a lonely
world, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel lonely, Andy?&rdquo; asked Lizzie, after a
while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lizzie; I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lizzie let herself settle, a little, against him, without either
seeming to notice it, and after another while she said, softly:
&ldquo;So do I, Andy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy knocked the ashes from his pipe very slowly and
deliberately, and put it away; then he seemed to brighten suddenly,
and said briskly: &ldquo;Well, Lizzie! Are you
satisfied!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Andy; I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m quite sure, Andy. I&rsquo;m perfectly
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Lizzie&mdash;it&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>But to-day&mdash;a couple of months after the proposal described
above&mdash; Andy had trouble on his mind, and the trouble was
connected with Lizzie Porter. He was putting up a two-rail fence
along the old log-paddock on the frontage, and working like a man
in trouble, trying to work it off his mind; and evidently not
succeeding&mdash; for the last two panels were out of line. He was
ramming a post&mdash; Andy rammed honestly, from the bottom of the
hole, not the last few shovelfuls below the surface, as some do. He
was ramming the last layer of clay when a cloud of white dust came
along the road, paused, and drifted or poured off into the scrub,
leaving long Dave Bentley, the horse-breaker, on his last
victim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Andy! Graftin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Dave,&rdquo; said Andy, in a
strange voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right!&rdquo; said Dave, rather puzzled. He
got down, wondering what was up, and hung his horse to the last
post but one.</p>

<p>Dave was Andy&rsquo;s opposite in one respect: he jumped to
conclusions, as women do; but, unlike women, he was mostly wrong.
He was an old chum and mate of Andy&rsquo;s who had always liked,
admired, and trusted him. But now, to his helpless surprise, Andy
went on scraping the earth from the surface with his long-handled
shovel, and heaping it conscientiously round the butt of the post,
his face like a block of wood, and his lips set grimly. Dave broke
out first (with bush oaths):</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Spit it out! What have
I been doin&rsquo; to you? What&rsquo;s yer got yer rag out about,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy faced him suddenly, with hatred for &ldquo;funny
business&rdquo; flashing in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say to my sister Mary about Lizzie
Porter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dave started; then he whistled long and low. &ldquo;Spit it all
out, Andy!&rdquo; he advised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said she was travellin&rsquo; with a
feller!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the harm in that? Everybody knows
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any crawler says a word about Lizzie Porter&mdash;look
here, me and you&rsquo;s got to fight, Dave Bentley!&rdquo; Then,
with still greater vehemence, as though he had a share in the
garment: &ldquo;Take off that coat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I know it!&rdquo; said Dave, with the sudden
quietness that comes to brave but headstrong and impulsive men at a
critical moment: &ldquo;Me and you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
fight, Andy; and&rdquo; (with sudden energy) &ldquo;if you try it
on I&rsquo;ll knock you into jim-rags!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, stepping close to Andy and taking him by the arm:
&ldquo;Andy, this thing will have to be fixed up. Come here; I want
to talk to you.&rdquo; And he led him some paces aside, inside the
boundary line, which seemed a ludicrously unnecessary precaution,
seeing that there was no one within sight or hearing save
Dave&rsquo;s horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Andy; let&rsquo;s have it over.
What&rsquo;s the matter with you and Lizzie Porter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> travellin&rsquo; with her, that&rsquo;s
all; and we&rsquo;re going to get married in two years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dave gave vent to another long, low whistle. He seemed to think
and make up his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Andy: we&rsquo;re old mates, ain&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you think I&rsquo;d tell you a blanky lie, or
crawl behind your back? Do you? Spit it out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always stuck up for you, Andy, and&mdash;why,
I&rsquo;ve fought for you behind your back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, Dave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my hand on it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy took his friend&rsquo;s hand mechanically, but gripped it
hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Andy, I&rsquo;ll tell you straight: It&rsquo;s
Gorstruth about Lizzie Porter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood as they were for a full minute, hands clasped; Andy
with his jaw dropped and staring in a dazed sort of way at Dave. He
raised his disengaged hand helplessly to his thatch, gulped
suspiciously, and asked in a broken voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how do you know it, Dave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know it? Andy, <i>I seen &rsquo;em meself!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did, Dave?&rdquo; in a tone that suggested sorrow
more than anger at Dave&rsquo;s part in the seeing of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gorstruth, Andy!&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Dave, who was the feller? That&rsquo;s all I
want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. I only seen them when I was
canterin&rsquo; past in the dusk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how&rsquo;d you know it was a man at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wore trousers, anyway, and was as big as you; so it
couldn&rsquo;t have been a girl. I&rsquo;m pretty safe to swear it
was Mick Kelly. I saw his horse hangin&rsquo; up at Porter&rsquo;s
once or twice. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do:
I&rsquo;ll find out for you, Andy. And, what&rsquo;s more,
I&rsquo;ll job him for you if I catch him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy said nothing; his hands clenched and his chest heaved. Dave
laid a friendly hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s red hot, Andy, I know. Anybody else but you
and I wouldn&rsquo;t have cared. But don&rsquo;t be a fool;
there&rsquo;s any Gorsquantity of girls knockin&rsquo; round. You
just give it to her straight and chuck her, and have done with it.
You must be bad off to bother about her. Gorstruth! she ain&rsquo;t
much to look at anyway! I&rsquo;ve got to ride like blazes to catch
the coach. Don&rsquo;t knock off till I come back; I won&rsquo;t be
above an hour. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to give you some points in
case you&rsquo;ve got to fight Mick; and I&rsquo;ll have to be
there to back you!&rdquo; And, thus taking the right moment
instinctively, he jumped on his horse and galloped on towards the
town.</p>

<p>His dust-cloud had scarcely disappeared round a corner of the
paddocks when Andy was aware of another one coming towards him. He
had a dazed idea that it was Dave coming back, but went on digging
another post-hole, mechanically, until a spring-cart rattled up,
and stopped opposite him. Then he lifted his head. It was Lizzie
herself, driving home from town. She turned towards him with her
usual faint smile. Her small features were &ldquo;washed out&rdquo;
and rather haggard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Andy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, at the sight of her, all his hatred of &ldquo;funny
business&rdquo; &mdash;intensified, perhaps, by a sense of personal
injury&mdash;came to a head, and he exploded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Lizzie Porter! I know all about you. You
needn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to cotton on with me
any more after this! I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen in a paddock with
yer! I&rsquo;m satisfied about you! Get on out of this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl stared at him for a moment thunderstruck; then she
lammed into the old horse with a stick she carried in place of a
whip.</p>

<p>She cried, and wondered what she&rsquo;d done, and trembled so
that she could scarcely unharness the horse, and wondered if Andy
had got a touch of the sun, and went in and sat down and cried
again; and pride came to her aid and she hated Andy; thought of her
big brother, away droving, and made a cup of tea. She shed tears
over the tea, and went through it all again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Andy was suffering a reaction. He started to fill the
hole before he put the post in; then to ram the post before the
rails were in position. Dubbing off the ends of the rails, he was
in danger of amputating a toe or a foot with every stroke of the
adze. And, at last, trying to squint along the little lumps of clay
which he had placed in the centre of the top of each post for
several panels back&mdash;to assist him to take a line&mdash; he
found that they swam and doubled, and ran off in watery angles, for
his eyes were too moist to see straight and single.</p>

<p>Then he threw down the tools hopelessly, and was standing
helplessly undecided whether to go home or go down to the creek and
drown himself, when Dave turned up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen her?&rdquo; asked Dave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you chuck her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Dave; are you sure the feller was Mick
Kelly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never said I was. How was I to know? It was dark. You
don&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;d &lsquo;fox&rsquo; a feller I see doing
a bit of a bear-up to a girl, do you? It might have been you, for
all I knowed. I suppose she&rsquo;s been talking you
round?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;But, look
here, Dave; I was properly gone on that girl, I was, and&mdash;and
I want to be sure I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The business was getting altogether too psychological for Dave
Bentley. &ldquo;You might as well,&rdquo; he rapped out,
&ldquo;call me a liar at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint that at all, Dave. I want to get at who the
feller is; that&rsquo;s what I want to get at now. Where did you
see them, and when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seen them Anniversary night, along the road, near
Ross&rsquo; farm; and I seen &rsquo;em Sunday night afore
that&mdash;in the trees near the old culvert&mdash; near
Porter&rsquo;s sliprails; and I seen &rsquo;em one night outside
Porter&rsquo;s, on a log near the woodheap. They was thick that
time, and bearin&rsquo; up proper, and no mistake. So I can swear
to her. Now, are you satisfied about her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Andy was wildly pitchforking his thatch under his hat with
all ten fingers and staring at Dave, who began to regard him
uneasily; then there came to Andy&rsquo;s eyes an awful glare,
which caused Dave to step back hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God, Andy! Are yer goin&rsquo; ratty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Andy, wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what the blazes is the matter with you? You&rsquo;ll
have rats if you don&rsquo;t look out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Jimminy froth</i>!&mdash;It was <i>me</i> all the
time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was me that was with her all them nights. It was me
that you seen. <i>Why, I popped on the woodheap</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dave was taken too suddenly to whistle this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you went for her just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; yelled Andy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy, hopelessly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dave whistled now&mdash;a very long, low whistle. &ldquo;Well,
you&rsquo;re a bloomin&rsquo; goat, Andy, after this. But this
thing&rsquo;ll have to be fixed up!&rdquo; and he cantered away.
Poor Andy was too badly knocked to notice the abruptness of
Dave&rsquo;s departure, or to see that he turned through the
sliprails on to the track that led to Porter&rsquo;s.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Half an hour later Andy appeared at Porter&rsquo;s back door,
with an expression on his face as though the funeral was to start
in ten minutes. In a tone befitting such an occasion, he wanted to
see Lizzie.</p>

<p>Dave had been there with the laudable determination of fixing
the business up, and had, of course, succeeded in making it much
worse than it was before. But Andy made it all right.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheIronBarkChip" id=
"TheIronBarkChip"></a>The Iron-Bark Chip</b>
</h2>

<p>Dave Regan and party&mdash;bush-fencers, tank-sinkers, rough
carpenters, &amp;c.&mdash; were finishing the third and last
culvert of their contract on the last section of the new railway
line, and had already sent in their vouchers for the completed
contract, so that there might be no excuse for extra delay in
connection with the cheque.</p>

<p>Now it had been expressly stipulated in the plans and
specifications that the timber for certain beams and girders was to
be iron-bark and no other, and Government inspectors were
authorised to order the removal from the ground of any timber or
material they might deem inferior, or not in accordance with the
stipulations. The railway contractor&rsquo;s foreman and inspector
of sub-contractors was a practical man and a bushman, but he had
been a timber-getter himself; his sympathies were bushy, and he was
on winking terms with Dave Regan. Besides, extended time was
expiring, and the contractors were in a hurry to complete the line.
But the Government inspector was a reserved man who poked round on
his independent own and appeared in lonely spots at unexpected
times &mdash;with apparently no definite object in life&mdash;like
a grey kangaroo bothered by a new wire fence, but unsuspicious of
the presence of humans. He wore a grey suit, rode, or mostly led,
an ashen-grey horse; the grass was long and grey, so he was seldom
spotted until he was well within the horizon and bearing leisurely
down on a party of sub-contractors, leading his horse.</p>

<p>Now iron-bark was scarce and distant on those ridges, and
another timber, similar in appearance, but much inferior in grain
and &ldquo;standing&rdquo; quality, was plentiful and close at
hand. Dave and party were &ldquo;about full of&rdquo; the job and
place, and wanted to get their cheque and be gone to another
&ldquo;spec&rdquo; they had in view. So they came to reckon
they&rsquo;d get the last girder from a handy tree, and have it
squared, in place, and carefully and conscientiously tarred before
the inspector happened along, if he did. But they didn&rsquo;t.
They got it squared, and ready to be lifted into its place; the
kindly darkness of tar was ready to cover a fraud that took four
strong men with crowbars and levers to shift; and now (such is the
regular cussedness of things) as the fraudulent piece of timber lay
its last hour on the ground, looking and smelling, to their guilty
imaginations like anything but iron-bark, they were aware of the
Government inspector drifting down upon them obliquely, with
something of the atmosphere of a casual Bill or Jim who had dropped
out of his easy-going track to see how they were getting on, and
borrow a match. They had more than half hoped that, as he had
visited them pretty frequently during the progress of the work, and
knew how near it was to completion, he wouldn&rsquo;t bother coming
any more. But it&rsquo;s the way with the Government. You might
move heaven and earth in vain endeavour to get the
&ldquo;Guvermunt&rdquo; to flutter an eyelash over something of the
most momentous importance to yourself and mates and the
district&mdash; even to the country; but just when you are leaving
authority severely alone, and have strong reasons for not wanting
to worry or interrupt it, and not desiring it to worry about you,
it will take a fancy into its head to come along and bother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the way!&rdquo; muttered Dave to his
mates. &ldquo;I knew the beggar would turn up! . . . And the only
cronk log we&rsquo;ve had, too!&rdquo; he added, in an injured
tone. &ldquo;If this had &rsquo;a&rsquo; been the only blessed
iron-bark in the whole contract, it would have been all right. . .
. Good-day, sir!&rdquo; (to the inspector). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
hot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. He was not of an impulsive nature. He got
down from his horse and looked at the girder in an abstracted way;
and presently there came into his eyes a dreamy, far-away, sad sort
of expression, as if there had been a very sad and painful
occurrence in his family, way back in the past, and that piece of
timber in some way reminded him of it and brought the old sorrow
home to him. He blinked three times, and asked, in a subdued
tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that iron-bark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack Bentley, the fluent liar of the party, caught his breath
with a jerk and coughed, to cover the gasp and gain time.
&ldquo;I&mdash;iron-bark? Of course it is! I thought you would know
iron-bark, mister.&rdquo; (Mister was silent.) &ldquo;What else
d&rsquo;yer think it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dreamy, abstracted expression was back. The inspector,
by-the-way, didn&rsquo;t know much about timber, but he had a great
deal of instinct, and went by it when in doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;L&mdash;look here, mister!&rdquo; put in Dave Regan, in a
tone of innocent puzzlement and with a blank bucolic face.
&ldquo;B&mdash;but don&rsquo;t the plans and specifications say
iron-bark? Ours does, anyway. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll git the papers
from the tent and show yer, if yer like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not necessary. The inspector admitted the fact slowly. He
stooped, and with an absent air picked up a chip. He looked at it
abstractedly for a moment, blinked his threefold blink; then,
seeming to recollect an appointment, he woke up suddenly and asked
briskly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did this chip come off that girder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blank silence. The inspector blinked six times, divided in
threes, rapidly, mounted his horse, said &ldquo;Day,&rdquo; and
rode off.</p>

<p>Regan and party stared at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what did he do that for?&rdquo; asked Andy
Page, the third in the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what for, you fool?&rdquo; enquired Dave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ta&mdash;take that chip for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking it to the office!&rdquo; snarled Jack
Bentley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what for? What does he want to do that
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get it blanky well analysed! You ass! Now are yer
satisfied?&rdquo; And Jack sat down hard on the timber, jerked out
his pipe, and said to Dave, in a sharp, toothache tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gimmiamatch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;well! what are we to do now?&rdquo; enquired
Andy, who was the hardest grafter, but altogether helpless,
hopeless, and useless in a crisis like this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grain and varnish the bloomin&rsquo; culvert!&rdquo;
snapped Bentley.</p>

<p>But Dave&rsquo;s eyes, that had been ruefully following the
inspector, suddenly dilated. The inspector had ridden a short
distance along the line, dismounted, thrown the bridle over a post,
laid the chip (which was too big to go in his pocket) on top of it,
got through the fence, and was now walking back at an angle across
the line in the direction of the fencing party, who had worked up
on the other side, a little more than opposite the culvert.</p>

<p>Dave took in the lay of the country at a glance and thought
rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gimme an iron-bark chip!&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>

<p>Bentley, who was quick-witted when the track was shown him, as
is a kangaroo dog (Jack ran by sight, not scent), glanced in the
line of Dave&rsquo;s eyes, jumped up, and got a chip about the same
size as that which the inspector had taken.</p>

<p>Now the &ldquo;lay of the country&rdquo; sloped generally to the
line from both sides, and the angle between the inspector&rsquo;s
horse, the fencing party, and the culvert was well within a clear
concave space; but a couple of hundred yards back from the line and
parallel to it (on the side on which Dave&rsquo;s party worked
their timber) a fringe of scrub ran to within a few yards of a
point which would be about in line with a single tree on the
cleared slope, the horse, and the fencing party.</p>

<p>Dave took the iron-bark chip, ran along the bed of the
water-course into the scrub, raced up the siding behind the bushes,
got safely, though without breathing, across the exposed space, and
brought the tree into line between him and the inspector, who was
talking to the fencers. Then he began to work quickly down the
slope towards the tree (which was a thin one), keeping it in line,
his arms close to his sides, and working, as it were, down the
trunk of the tree, as if the fencing party were kangaroos and Dave
was trying to get a shot at them. The inspector, by-the-bye, had a
habit of glancing now and then in the direction of his horse, as
though under the impression that it was flighty and restless and
inclined to bolt on opportunity. It was an anxious moment for all
parties concerned&mdash;except the inspector. They didn&rsquo;t
want&nbsp;<i>him</i>&nbsp;to be perturbed. And, just as Dave
reached the foot of the tree, the inspector finished what he had to
say to the fencers, turned, and started to walk briskly back to his
horse. There was a thunderstorm coming. Now was the critical
moment&mdash; there were certain prearranged signals between
Dave&rsquo;s party and the fencers which might have interested the
inspector, but none to meet a case like this.</p>

<p>Jack Bentley gasped, and started forward with an idea of
intercepting the inspector and holding him for a few minutes in
bogus conversation. Inspirations come to one at a critical moment,
and it flashed on Jack&rsquo;s mind to send Andy instead. Andy
looked as innocent and guileless as he was, but was uncomfortable
in the vicinity of &ldquo;funny business&rdquo;, and must have an
honest excuse. &ldquo;Not that that mattered,&rdquo; commented Jack
afterwards; &ldquo;it would have taken the inspector ten minutes to
get at what Andy was driving at, whatever it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, Andy! Tell him there&rsquo;s a heavy thunderstorm
coming and he&rsquo;d better stay in our humpy till it&rsquo;s
over. Run! Don&rsquo;t stand staring like a blanky fool.
He&rsquo;ll be gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy started. But just then, as luck would have it, one of the
fencers started after the inspector, hailing him as &ldquo;Hi,
mister!&rdquo; He wanted to be set right about the survey or
something &mdash;or to pretend to want to be set right&mdash;from
motives of policy which I haven&rsquo;t time to explain here.</p>

<p>That fencer explained afterwards to Dave&rsquo;s party that he
&ldquo;seen what you coves was up to,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s why
he called the inspector back. But he told them that after they had
told their yarn&mdash;which was a mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back, Andy!&rdquo; cried Jack Bentley.</p>

<p>Dave Regan slipped round the tree, down on his hands and knees,
and made quick time through the grass which, luckily, grew pretty
tall on the thirty or forty yards of slope between the tree and the
horse. Close to the horse, a thought struck Dave that pulled him
up, and sent a shiver along his spine and a hungry feeling under
it. The horse would break away and bolt! But the case was
desperate. Dave ventured an interrogatory &ldquo;Cope, cope,
cope?&rdquo; The horse turned its head wearily and regarded him
with a mild eye, as if he&rsquo;d expected him to come, and come on
all fours, and wondered what had kept him so long; then he went on
thinking. Dave reached the foot of the post; the horse obligingly
leaning over on the other leg. Dave reared head and shoulders
cautiously behind the post, like a snake; his hand went up twice,
swiftly&mdash;the first time he grabbed the inspector&rsquo;s chip,
and the second time he put the iron-bark one in its place. He drew
down and back, and scuttled off for the tree like a gigantic
tailless &ldquo;goanna&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he walked up to the culvert from along the
creek, smoking hard to settle his nerves.</p>

<p>The sky seemed to darken suddenly; the first great drops of the
thunderstorm came pelting down. The inspector hurried to his horse,
and cantered off along the line in the direction of the
fettlers&rsquo; camp.</p>

<p>He had forgotten all about the chip, and left it on top of the
post!</p>

<p>Dave Regan sat down on the beam in the rain and swore
comprehensively.</p>

</h2>

<h3 align="center"><b>I<br>
The First Born</b>
</h3>

<p>The struggling&nbsp;squatter is to be found in Australia as well
as the &ldquo;struggling farmer&rdquo;. The Australian squatter is
not always the mighty wool king that English and American authors
and other uninformed people apparently imagine him to be.
Squatting, at the best, is but a game of chance. It depends mainly
on the weather, and that, in New South Wales at least, depends on
nothing.</p>

<p>Joe Middleton was a struggling squatter, with a station some
distance to the westward of the furthest line reached by the
ordinary &ldquo;new chum&rdquo;. His run, at the time of our story,
was only about six miles square, and his stock was limited in
proportion. The hands on Joe&rsquo;s run consisted of his brother
Dave, a middle-aged man known only as &ldquo;Middleton&rsquo;s
Peter&rdquo; (who had been in the service of the Middleton family
ever since Joe Middleton could remember), and an old black
shepherd, with his gin and two boys.</p>

<p>It was in the first year of Joe&rsquo;s marriage. He had married
a very ordinary girl, as far as Australian girls go, but in his
eyes she was an angel. He really worshipped her.</p>

<p>One sultry afternoon in midsummer all the station hands, with
the exception of Dave Middleton, were congregated about the
homestead door, and it was evident from their solemn faces that
something unusual was the matter. They appeared to be watching for
something or someone across the flat, and the old black shepherd,
who had been listening intently with bent head, suddenly
straightened himself up and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hear the cart. I can see it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>You must bear in mind that our blackfellows do not always talk
the gibberish with which they are credited by story writers.</p>

<p>It was not until some time after Black Bill had spoken that the
white &mdash; or, rather, the brown &mdash; portion of the party
could see or even hear the approaching vehicle. At last, far out
through the trunks of the native apple-trees, the cart was seen
approaching; and as it came nearer it was evident that it was being
driven at a break-neck pace, the horses cantering all the way,
while the motion of the cart, as first one wheel and then the other
sprang from a root or a rut, bore a striking resemblance to the
Highland Fling. There were two persons in the cart. One was Mother
Palmer, a stout, middle-aged party (who sometimes did the duties of
a midwife), and the other was Dave Middleton, Joe&rsquo;s
brother.</p>

<p>The cart was driven right up to the door with scarcely any
abatement of speed, and was stopped so suddenly that Mrs. Palmer
was sent sprawling on to the horse&rsquo;s rump. She was quickly
helped down, and, as soon as she had recovered sufficient breath,
she followed Black Mary into the bedroom where young Mrs. Middleton
was lying, looking very pale and frightened. The horse which had
been driven so cruelly had not done blowing before another cart
appeared, also driven very fast. It contained old Mr. and Mrs.
Middleton, who lived comfortably on a small farm not far from
Palmer&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>As soon as he had dumped Mrs. Palmer, Dave Middleton left the
cart and, mounting a fresh horse which stood ready saddled in the
yard, galloped off through the scrub in a different direction.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards Joe Middleton came home on a horse that
had been almost ridden to death. His mother came out at the sound
of his arrival, and he anxiously asked her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find Doc. Wild?&rdquo; asked the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, confound him!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe bitterly.
&ldquo;He promised me faithfully to come over on Wednesday and stay
until Maggie was right again. Now he has left Dean&rsquo;s and gone
&mdash; Lord knows where. I suppose he is drinking again. How is
Maggie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now &mdash; the child is born.
It&rsquo;s a boy; but she is very weak. Dave got Mrs. Palmer here
just in time. I had better tell you at once that Mrs. Palmer says
if we don&rsquo;t get a doctor here to-night poor Maggie
won&rsquo;t live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God! and what am I to do?&rdquo; cried Joe
desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any other doctor within reach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; there is only the one at B&mdash;&mdash;;
that&rsquo;s forty miles away, and he is laid up with the broken
leg he got in the buggy accident. Where&rsquo;s Dave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone to Black&rsquo;s shanty. One of Mrs. Palmer&rsquo;s
sons thought he remembered someone saying that Doc. Wild was there
last week. That&rsquo;s fifteen miles away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is our only hope,&rdquo; said Joe dejectedly.
&ldquo;I wish to God that I had taken Maggie to some civilised
place a month ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doc. Wild was a well-known character among the bushmen of New
South Wales, and although the profession did not recognise him, and
denounced him as an empiric, his skill was undoubted. Bushmen had
great faith in him, and would often ride incredible distances in
order to bring him to the bedside of a sick friend. He drank
fearfully, but was seldom incapable of treating a patient; he
would, however, sometimes be found in an obstinate mood and refuse
to travel to the side of a sick person, and then the devil himself
could not make the doctor budge. But for all this he was very
generous &mdash; a fact that could, no doubt, be testified to by
many a grateful sojourner in the lonely bush.</p>

<h3 align="center"><b>II<br>
The Only Hope</b>
</h3>

<p>Night came on, and still there was no change in the condition of
the young wife, and no sign of the doctor. Several stockmen from
the neighbouring stations, hearing that there was trouble at Joe
Middleton&rsquo;s, had ridden over, and had galloped off on long,
hopeless rides in search of a doctor. Being generally free from
sickness themselves, these bushmen look upon it as a serious
business even in its mildest form; what is more, their sympathy is
always practical where it is possible for it to be so. One day,
while out on the run after an &ldquo;outlaw&rdquo;, Joe Middleton
was badly thrown from his horse, and the break-neck riding that was
done on that occasion from the time the horse came home with empty
saddle until the rider was safe in bed and attended by a doctor was
something extraordinary, even for the bush.</p>

<p>Before the time arrived when Dave Middleton might reasonably
have been expected to return, the station people were anxiously
watching for him, all except the old blackfellow and the two boys,
who had gone to yard the sheep.</p>

<p>The party had been increased by Jimmy Nowlett, the bullocky, who
had just arrived with a load of fencing wire and provisions for
Middleton. Jimmy was standing in the moonlight, whip in hand,
looking as anxious as the husband himself, and endeavouring to
calculate by mental arithmetic the exact time it ought to take Dave
to complete his double journey, taking into consideration the
distance, the obstacles in the way, and the chances of
horse-flesh.</p>

<p>But the time which Jimmy fixed for the arrival came without
Dave.</p>

<p>Old Peter (as he was generally called, though he was not really
old) stood aside in his usual sullen manner, his hat drawn down
over his brow and eyes, and nothing visible but a thick and very
horizontal black beard, from the depth of which emerged large
clouds of very strong tobacco smoke, the product of a short, black,
clay pipe.</p>

<p>They had almost given up all hope of seeing Dave return that
night, when Peter slowly and deliberately removed his pipe and
grunted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then replaced the pipe, and smoked on as before.</p>

<p>All listened, but not one of them could hear a sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yer ears must be pretty sharp for yer age, Peter. We
can&rsquo;t hear him,&rdquo; remarked Jimmy Nowlett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His dog ken,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

<p>The pipe was again removed and its abbreviated stem pointed in
the direction of Dave&rsquo;s cattle dog, who had risen beside his
kennel with pointed ears, and was looking eagerly in the direction
from which his master was expected to come.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of horse&rsquo;s hoofs was distinctly
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hear two horses,&rdquo; cried Jimmy Nowlett
excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one,&rdquo; said old Peter
quietly.</p>

<p>A few moments passed, and a single horseman appeared on the far
side of the flat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Doc. Wild on Dave&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; cried
Jimmy Nowlett. &ldquo;Dave don&rsquo;t ride like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dave,&rdquo; said Peter, replacing his pipe
and looking more unsociable than ever.</p>

<p>Dave rode up and, throwing himself wearily from the saddle,
stood ominously silent by the side of his horse.</p>

<p>Joe Middleton said nothing, but stood aside with an expression
of utter hopelessness on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not there?&rdquo; asked Jimmy Nowlett at last, addressing
Dave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; answered Dave,
impatiently.</p>

<p>This was not the answer they expected, but nobody seemed
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here old Peter removed his pipe, and pronounced the one word
&mdash; &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell do you mean by that?&rdquo; muttered Dave,
whose patience had evidently been severely tried by the clever but
intemperate bush doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How drunk?&rdquo; explained Peter, with great
equanimity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stubborn drunk, blind drunk, beastly drunk, dead drunk,
and damned well drunk, if that&rsquo;s what you want to
know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Doc. say?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said he was sick &mdash; had lumbago &mdash;
wouldn&rsquo;t come for the Queen of England; said he wanted a
course of treatment himself. Curse him! I have no patience to talk
about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give him a course of treatment,&rdquo; muttered
Jimmy viciously, trailing the long lash of his bullock-whip through
the grass and spitting spitefully at the ground.</p>

<p>Dave turned away and joined Joe, who was talking earnestly to
his mother by the kitchen door. He told them that he had spent an
hour trying to persuade Doc. Wild to come, and, that before he had
left the shanty, Black had promised him faithfully to bring the
doctor over as soon as his obstinate mood wore off.</p>

<p>Just then a low moan was heard from the sick room, followed by
the sound of Mother Palmer&rsquo;s voice calling old Mrs.
Middleton, who went inside immediately.</p>

<p>No one had noticed the disappearance of Peter, and when he
presently returned from the stockyard, leading the only fresh horse
that remained, Jimmy Nowlett began to regard him with some
interest. Peter transferred the saddle from Dave&rsquo;s horse to
the other, and then went into a small room off the kitchen, which
served him as a bedroom; from it he soon returned with a
formidable-looking revolver, the chambers of which he examined in
the moonlight in full view of all the company. They thought for a
moment the man had gone mad. Old Middleton leaped quickly behind
Nowlett, and Black Mary, who had come out to the cask at the corner
for a dipper of water, dropped the dipper and was inside like a
shot. One of the black boys came softly up at that moment; as soon
as his sharp eye &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; the weapon, he disappeared
as though the earth had swallowed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the mischief are yer goin&rsquo; ter do,
Peter?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to fetch him,&rdquo; said Peter, and, after
carefully emptying his pipe and replacing it in a leather pouch at
his belt, he mounted and rode off at an easy canter.</p>

<p>Jimmy watched the horse until it disappeared at the edge of the
flat, and then after coiling up the long lash of his bullock-whip
in the dust until it looked like a sleeping snake, he prodded the
small end of the long pine handle into the middle of the coil, as
though driving home a point, and said in a tone of intense
conviction:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll fetch him.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center"><b>III<br>
Doc. Wild</b>
</h3>

<p>Peter gradually increased his horse&rsquo;s speed along the
rough bush track until he was riding at a good pace. It was ten
miles to the main road, and five from there to the shanty kept by
Black.</p>

<p>For some time before Peter started the atmosphere had been very
close and oppressive. The great black edge of a storm-cloud had
risen in the east, and everything indicated the approach of a
thunderstorm. It was not long coming. Before Peter had completed
six miles of his journey, the clouds rolled over, obscuring the
moon, and an Australian thunderstorm came on with its mighty
downpour, its blinding lightning, and its earth-shaking thunder.
Peter rode steadily on, only pausing now and then until a flash
revealed the track in front of him.</p>

<p>Black&rsquo;s shanty &mdash; or, rather, as the sign had it,
&ldquo;Post Office and General Store&rdquo; &mdash; was, as we have
said, five miles along the main road from the point where
Middleton&rsquo;s track joined it. The building was of the usual
style of bush architecture. About two hundred yards nearer the
creek, which crossed the road further on, stood a large bark and
slab stable, large enough to have met the requirements of a
legitimate bush &ldquo;public&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The reader may doubt that a &ldquo;sly grog shop&rdquo; could
openly carry on business on a main Government road along which
mounted troopers were continually passing. But then, you see,
mounted troopers get thirsty like other men; moreover, they could
always get their thirst quenched &lsquo;gratis&rsquo; at these
places; so the reader will be prepared to hear that on this very
night two troopers&rsquo; horses were stowed snugly away in the
stable, and two troopers were stowed snugly away in the back room
of the shanty, sleeping off the effects of their cheap but strong
potations.</p>

<p>There were two rooms, of a sort, attached to the stables &mdash;
one at each end. One was occupied by a man who was &ldquo;generally
useful&rdquo;, and the other was the surgery, office, and
bedroom&nbsp;<i>pro tem.</i>&nbsp;of Doc. Wild.</p>

<p>Doc. Wild was a tall man, of spare proportions. He had a
cadaverous face, black hair, bushy black eyebrows, eagle nose, and
eagle eyes. He never slept while he was drinking. On this occasion
he sat in front of the fire on a low three-legged stool. His knees
were drawn up, his toes hooked round the front legs of the stool,
one hand resting on one knee, and one elbow (the hand supporting
the chin) resting on the other. He was staring intently into the
fire, on which an old black saucepan was boiling and sending forth
a pungent odour of herbs. There seemed something uncanny about the
doctor as the red light of the fire fell on his hawk-like face and
gleaming eyes. He might have been Mephistopheles watching some
infernal brew.</p>

<p>He had sat there some time without stirring a finger, when the
door suddenly burst open and Middleton&rsquo;s Peter stood within,
dripping wet. The doctor turned his black, piercing eyes upon the
intruder (who regarded him silently) for a moment, and then asked
quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you want me for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to come to Joe Middleton&rsquo;s wife.
She&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; said Peter calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; shouted the doctor.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought enough horse-stealers into the world
already. If any more want to come they can go to blazes for me.
Now, you get out of this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get yer rag out,&rdquo; said Peter quietly.
&ldquo;The hoss-stealer&rsquo;s come, an&rsquo; nearly killed his
mother ter begin with; an&rsquo; if yer don&rsquo;t get yer
physic-box an&rsquo; come wi&rsquo; me, by the great God I&rsquo;ll
&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the revolver was produced and pointed at Doc. Wild&rsquo;s
head. The sight of the weapon had a sobering effect upon the
doctor. He rose, looked at Peter critically for a moment, knocked
the weapon out of his hand, and said slowly and deliberately:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, ef the case es as serious as that, I (hic) reckon
I&rsquo;d better come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter was still of the same opinion, so Doc. Wild proceeded to
get his medicine chest ready. He explained afterwards, in one of
his softer moments, that the shooter didn&rsquo;t frighten him so
much as it touched his memory &mdash; &ldquo;sorter put him in mind
of the old days in California, and made him think of the man he
might have been,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say, &mdash; &ldquo;kinder
touched his heart and slid the durned old panorama in front of him
like a flash; made him think of the time when he slipped three
leaden pills into &lsquo;Blue Shirt&rsquo; for winking at a new
chum behind his (the Doc.&rsquo;s) back when he was telling a
truthful yarn, and charged the said &lsquo;Blue Shirt&rsquo; a
hundred dollars for extracting the said pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe Middleton&rsquo;s wife is a grandmother now.</p>

<p>Peter passed after the manner of his sort; he was found dead in
his bunk.</p>

<p>Poor Doc. Wild died in a shepherd&rsquo;s hut at the Dry Creeks.
The shepherds (white men) found him, &ldquo;naked as he was born
and with the hide half burned off him with the sun,&rdquo; rounding
up imaginary snakes on a dusty clearing, one blazing hot day. The
hut-keeper had some &ldquo;quare&rdquo; (queer) experiences with
the doctor during the next three days and used, in after years, to
tell of them, between the puffs of his pipe, calmly and solemnly
and as if the story was rather to the doctor&rsquo;s credit than
otherwise. The shepherds sent for the police and a doctor, and sent
word to Joe Middleton. Doc. Wild was sensible towards the end. His
interview with the other doctor was characteristic. &ldquo;And, now
you see how far I am,&rdquo; he said in conclusion &mdash;
&ldquo;have you brought the brandy?&rdquo; The other doctor had.
Joe Middleton came with his waggonette, and in it the softest
mattress and pillows the station afforded. He also, in his
innocence, brought a dozen of soda-water. Doc. Wild took
Joe&rsquo;s hand feebly, and, a little later, he &ldquo;passed
out&rdquo; (as he would have said) murmuring &ldquo;something that
sounded like poetry&rdquo;, in an unknown tongue. Joe took the body
to the home station. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the boss
bringin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked the shearers, seeing the waggonette
coming very slowly and the boss walking by the horses&rsquo; heads.
&ldquo;Doc. Wild,&rdquo; said a station hand. &ldquo;Take yer hats
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They buried him with bush honours, and chiselled his name on a
slab of bluegum &mdash; a wood that lasts.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryofDaveRegan" id=
"TheMysteryofDaveRegan"></a>The Mystery of Dave Regan</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;then there was Dave Regan,&rdquo; said the
traveller. &ldquo;Dave used to die oftener than any other bushman I
knew. He was always being reported dead and turnin&rsquo; up again.
He seemed to like it &mdash; except once, when his brother drew his
money and drank it all to drown his grief at what he called
Dave&rsquo;s &lsquo;untimely end&rsquo;. Well, Dave went up to
Queensland once with cattle, and was away three years and reported
dead, as usual. He was drowned in the Bogan this time while
tryin&rsquo; to swim his horse acrost a flood &mdash; and his
sweetheart hurried up and got spliced to a worse man before Dave
got back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one day I was out in the bush lookin&rsquo; for
timber, when the biggest storm ever knowed in that place come on.
There was hail in it, too, as big as bullets, and if I hadn&rsquo;t
got behind a stump and crouched down in time I&rsquo;d have been
riddled like a &mdash; like a bushranger. As it was, I got
soakin&rsquo; wet. The storm was over in a few minutes, the water
run off down the gullies, and the sun come out and the scrub
steamed &mdash; and stunk like a new pair of moleskin trousers. I
went on along the track, and presently I seen a long, lanky chap
get on to a long, lanky horse and ride out of a bush yard at the
edge of a clearin&rsquo;. I knowed it was Dave d&rsquo;reckly I set
eyes on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dave used to ride a tall, holler-backed thoroughbred with
a body and limbs like a kangaroo dog, and it would circle around
you and sidle away as if it was frightened you was goin&rsquo; to
jab a knife into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello! Dave!&rsquo; said I, as he came
spurrin&rsquo; up. &lsquo;How are yer!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jim!&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;How are
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How are yer
gettin&rsquo; on?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, before we could say any more, that horse shied away
and broke off through the scrub to the right. I waited, because I
knowed Dave would come back again if I waited long enough; and in
about ten minutes he came sidlin&rsquo; in from the scrub to the
left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rsquo; says he,
spurrin&rsquo; up sideways; &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How&rsquo;s the old
people?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t been home yet,&rsquo; says he,
holdin&rsquo; out his hand; but, afore I could grip it, the cussed
horse sidled off to the south end of the clearin&rsquo; and broke
away again through the scrub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard Dave swearin&rsquo; about the country for twenty
minutes or so, and then he came spurrin&rsquo; and cursin&rsquo; in
from the other end of the clearin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where have you been all this time?&rsquo; I said,
as the horse came curvin&rsquo; up like a boomerang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gulf country,&rsquo; said Dave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was a storm, Dave,&rsquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My oath!&rsquo; says Dave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get caught in it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Got to shelter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you&rsquo;re as dry&rsquo;s a bone,
Dave!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dave grinned. &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; the
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo; he yelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said that to the horse as it boomeranged off again and
broke away through the scrub. I waited; but he didn&rsquo;t come
back, and I reckoned he&rsquo;d got so far away before he could
pull up that he didn&rsquo;t think it worth while comin&rsquo;
back; so I went on. By-and-bye I got thinkin&rsquo;. Dave was as
dry as a bone, and I knowed that he hadn&rsquo;t had time to get to
shelter, for there wasn&rsquo;t a shed within twelve miles. He
wasn&rsquo;t only dry, but his coat was creased and dusty too
&mdash; same as if he&rsquo;d been sleepin&rsquo; in a holler log;
and when I come to think of it, his face seemed thinner and whiter
than it used ter, and so did his hands and wrists, which always
stuck a long way out of his coat-sleeves; and there was blood on
his face &mdash; but I thought he&rsquo;d got scratched with a
twig. (Dave used to wear a coat three or four sizes too small for
him, with sleeves that didn&rsquo;t come much below his elbows and
a tail that scarcely reached his waist behind.) And his hair seemed
dark and lank, instead of bein&rsquo; sandy and stickin&rsquo; out
like an old fibre brush, as it used ter. And then I thought his
voice sounded different, too. And, when I enquired next day, there
was no one heard of Dave, and the chaps reckoned I must have been
drunk, or seen his ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem all right at all &mdash; it worried
me a lot. I couldn&rsquo;t make out how Dave kept dry; and the
horse and saddle and saddle-cloth was wet. I told the chaps how he
talked to me and what he said, and how he swore at the horse; but
they only said it was Dave&rsquo;s ghost and nobody else&rsquo;s. I
told &rsquo;em about him bein&rsquo; dry as a bone after
gettin&rsquo; caught in that storm; but they only laughed and said
it was a dry place where Dave went to. I talked and argued about it
until the chaps began to tap their foreheads and wink &mdash; then
I left off talking. But I didn&rsquo;t leave off thinkin&rsquo;
&mdash; I always hated a mystery. Even Dave&rsquo;s father told me
that Dave couldn&rsquo;t be alive or else his ghost wouldn&rsquo;t
be round &mdash; he said he knew Dave better than that. One or two
fellers did turn up afterwards that had seen Dave about the time
that I did &mdash; and then the chaps said they was sure that Dave
was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But one fine day, as a lot of us chaps was playin&rsquo;
pitch and toss at the shanty, one of the fellers yelled out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Gee! Here comes Dave Regan!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I looked up and saw Dave himself, sidlin&rsquo; out
of a cloud of dust on a long lanky horse. He rode into the
stockyard, got down, hung his horse up to a post, put up the rails,
and then come slopin&rsquo; towards us with a half-acre grin on his
face. Dave had long, thin bow-legs, and when he was on the ground
he moved as if he was on roller skates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;El-lo, Dave!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How are
yer?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jim!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;How the
blazes are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says I, shakin&rsquo; hands.
&lsquo;How are yer?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m all right!&rsquo; he says.
&lsquo;How are yer poppin&rsquo; up!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when we&rsquo;d got all that settled, and the other
chaps had asked how he was, he said: &lsquo;Ah, well! Let&rsquo;s
have a drink.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all the other chaps crawfished up and flung
themselves round the corner and sidled into the bar after Dave. We
had a lot of talk, and he told us that he&rsquo;d been down before,
but had gone away without seein&rsquo; any of us, except me,
because he&rsquo;d suddenly heard of a mob of cattle at a station
two hundred miles away; and after a while I took him aside and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Dave! Do you remember the day I met you
after the storm?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He scratched his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; he says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you get under shelter that day?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why &mdash; no.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then how the blazes didn&rsquo;t yer get
wet?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dave grinned; then he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, when I seen the storm coming I took off me
clothes and stuck &rsquo;em in a holler log till the rain was
over.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he says, after the other coves had
done laughin&rsquo;, but before I&rsquo;d done thinking; &lsquo;I
kept my clothes dry and got a good refreshin&rsquo; shower-bath
into the bargain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he scratched the back of his neck with his little
finger, and dropped his jaw, and thought a bit; then he rubbed the
top of his head and his shoulder, reflective-like, and then he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t reckon for them there blanky
hailstones.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellonMatrimony" id=
"MitchellonMatrimony"></a>Mitchell on Matrimony</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;suppose your wife will be glad to see you,&rdquo;
said Mitchell to his mate in their camp by the dam at Hungerford.
They were overhauling their swags, and throwing away the blankets,
and calico, and old clothes, and rubbish they didn&rsquo;t
want&mdash;everything, in fact, except their pocket-books and
letters and portraits, things which men carry about with them
always, that are found on them when they die, and sent to their
relations if possible. Otherwise they are taken in charge by the
constable who officiates at the inquest, and forwarded to the
Minister of Justice along with the depositions.</p>

<p>It was the end of the shearing season. Mitchell and his mate had
been lucky enough to get two good sheds in succession, and were
going to take the coach from Hungerford to Bourke on their way to
Sydney. The morning stars were bright yet, and they sat down to a
final billy of tea, two dusty Johnny-cakes, and a scrag of salt
mutton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll be glad to see her too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will,&rdquo; said Mitchell. He placed his
pint-pot between his feet, rested his arm against his knee, and
stirred the tea meditatively with the handle of his pocket-knife.
It was vaguely understood that Mitchell had been married at one
period of his chequered career.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ever understood women
properly,&rdquo; he said, as he took a cautious sip to see if his
tea was cool and sweet enough, for his lips were sore; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think we ever will&mdash;we never took the trouble to
try, and if we did it would be only wasted brain power that might
just as well be spent on the blackfellow&rsquo;s lingo; because by
the time you&rsquo;ve learnt it they&rsquo;ll be extinct, and woman
&lsquo;ll be extinct before you&rsquo;ve learnt her. . . . The
morning star looks bright, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Mitchell after a while,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s many little things we might try to understand
women in. I read in a piece of newspaper the other day about how a
man changes after he&rsquo;s married; how he gets short, and
impatient, and bored (which is only natural), and sticks up a wall
of newspaper between himself and his wife when he&rsquo;s at home;
and how it comes like a cold shock to her, and all her air-castles
vanish, and in the end she often thinks about taking the baby and
the clothes she stands in, and going home for sympathy and comfort
to mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she never got a word of sympathy from her mother
in her life, nor a day&rsquo;s comfort at home before she was
married; but that doesn&rsquo;t make the slightest difference. It
doesn&rsquo;t make any difference in your case either, if you
haven&rsquo;t been acting like a dutiful son-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody wrote that a woman&rsquo;s love is her whole
existence, while a man&rsquo;s love is only part of his&mdash;which
is true, and only natural and reasonable, all things considered.
But women never consider as a rule. A man can&rsquo;t go on talking
lovey-dovey talk for ever, and listening to his young wife&rsquo;s
prattle when he&rsquo;s got to think about making a living, and
nursing her and answering her childish questions and telling her he
loves his little ownest every minute in the day, while the bills
are running up, and rent mornings begin to fly round and hustle and
crowd him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got her and he&rsquo;s satisfied; and if the
truth is known he loves her really more than he did when they were
engaged, only she won&rsquo;t be satisfied about it unless he tells
her so every hour in the day. At least that&rsquo;s how it is for
the first few months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a woman doesn&rsquo;t understand these
things&mdash;she never will, she can&rsquo;t&mdash; and it would be
just as well for us to try and understand that she doesn&rsquo;t
and can&rsquo;t understand them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell knocked the tea-leaves out of his pannikin against his
boot, and reached for the billy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many little things we might do that seem
mere trifles and nonsense to us, but mean a lot to her; that
wouldn&rsquo;t be any trouble or sacrifice to us, but might help to
make her life happy. It&rsquo;s just because we never think about
these little things&mdash;don&rsquo;t think them worth thinking
about, in fact&mdash; they never enter our intellectual
foreheads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, when you&rsquo;re going out in the morning
you might put your arms round her and give her a hug and a kiss,
without her having to remind you. You may forget about it and never
think any more of it&mdash; but she will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be any trouble to you, and would only
take a couple of seconds, and would give her something to be happy
about when you&rsquo;re gone, and make her sing to herself for
hours while she bustles about her work and thinks up what
she&rsquo;ll get you for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell&rsquo;s mate sighed, and shifted the sugar-bag over
towards Mitchell. He seemed touched and bothered over
something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then again,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;it
mightn&rsquo;t be convenient for you to go home to
dinner&mdash;something might turn up during the morning&mdash; you
might have some important business to do, or meet some chaps and
get invited to lunch and not be very well able to refuse, when
it&rsquo;s too late, or you haven&rsquo;t a chance to send a
message to your wife. But then again, chaps and business seem very
big things to you, and only little things to the wife; just as
lovey-dovey talk is important to her and nonsense to you. And when
you come to analyse it, one is not so big, nor the other so small,
after all; especially when you come to think that chaps can always
wait, and business is only an inspiration in your mind, nine cases
out of ten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of the trouble she takes to get you a good dinner,
and how she keeps it hot between two plates in the oven, and waits
hour after hour till the dinner gets dried up, and all her
morning&rsquo;s work is wasted. Think how it hurts her, and how
anxious she&rsquo;ll be (especially if you&rsquo;re inclined to
booze) for fear that something has happened to you. You can&rsquo;t
get it out of the heads of some young wives that you&rsquo;re
liable to get run over, or knocked down, or assaulted, or robbed,
or get into one of the fixes that a woman is likely to get into.
But about the dinner waiting. Try and put yourself in her place.
Wouldn&rsquo;t you get mad under the same circumstances? I know I
would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember once, only just after I was married, I was
invited unexpectedly to a kidney pudding and beans&mdash;which was
my favourite grub at the time&mdash; and I didn&rsquo;t resist,
especially as it was washing day and I told the wife not to bother
about anything for dinner. I got home an hour or so late, and had a
good explanation thought out, when the wife met me with a smile as
if we had just been left a thousand pounds. She&rsquo;d got her
washing finished without assistance, though I&rsquo;d told her to
get somebody to help her, and she had a kidney pudding and beans,
with a lot of extras thrown in, as a pleasant surprise for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I kissed her, and sat down, and stuffed till I
thought every mouthful would choke me. I got through with it
somehow, but I&rsquo;ve never cared for kidney pudding or beans
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell felt for his pipe with a fatherly smile in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then again,&rdquo; he continued, as he cut up his
tobacco, &ldquo;your wife might put on a new dress and fix herself
up and look well, and you might think so and be satisfied with her
appearance and be proud to take her out; but you want to tell her
so, and tell her so as often as you think about it&mdash;and try to
think a little oftener than men usually do, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have made a good husband, Jack,&rdquo; said
his mate, in a softened tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, perhaps I should,&rdquo; said Mitchell, rubbing
up his tobacco; then he asked abstractedly: &ldquo;What sort of a
husband did you make, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have made a better one than I did,&rdquo; said
Joe seriously, and rather bitterly, &ldquo;but I know one thing,
I&rsquo;m going to try and make up for it when I go back this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all say that,&rdquo; said Mitchell reflectively,
filling his pipe. &ldquo;She loves you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know she does,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>Mitchell lit up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so would any man who knew her or had seen her letters
to you,&rdquo; he said between the puffs. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s happy
and contented enough, I believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;at least while I was there.
She&rsquo;s never easy when I&rsquo;m away. I might have made her a
good deal more happy and contented without hurting myself
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell smoked long, soft, measured puffs.</p>

<p>His mate shifted uneasily and glanced at him a couple of times,
and seemed to become impatient, and to make up his mind about
something; or perhaps he got an idea that Mitchell had been
&ldquo;having&rdquo; him, and felt angry over being betrayed into
maudlin confidences; for he asked abruptly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is your wife now, Mitchell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mitchell calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; echoed the mate.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you treat her well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell removed his pipe and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I tried to,&rdquo; he said wearily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, did you put your theory into practice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Mitchell very deliberately.</p>

<p>Joe waited, but nothing came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked impatiently, &ldquo;How did it act?
Did it work well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mitchell (puff);
&ldquo;she left me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell jerked the half-smoked pipe from his mouth, and rapped
the burning tobacco out against the toe of his boot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She left me,&rdquo; he said, standing up and stretching
himself. Then, with a vicious jerk of his arm, &ldquo;She left me
for&mdash;another kind of a fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked east towards the public-house, where they were taking
the coach-horses from the stable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you finish your tea, Joe? The
billy&rsquo;s getting cold.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellonWomen" id=

</h2>

<p>&ldquo;All&nbsp;the same,&rdquo; said Mitchell&rsquo;s mate,
continuing an argument by the camp-fire; &ldquo;all the same, I
think that a woman can stand cold water better than a man. Why,
when I was staying in a boarding-house in Dunedin, one very cold
winter, there was a lady lodger who went down to the shower-bath
first thing every morning; never missed one; sometimes went in
freezing weather when I wouldn&rsquo;t go into a cold bath for a
fiver; and sometimes she&rsquo;d stay under the shower for ten
minutes at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my room was near the bath-room, and I could hear the
shower and tap going, and her floundering about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear your grandmother!&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell,
contemptuously. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know women yet. Was this
woman married? Did she have a husband there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; she was a young widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! well, it would have been the same if she was a young
girl&mdash; or an old one. Were there some passable men-boarders
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i>&nbsp;was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! But I mean, were there any there beside
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there were three or four; there was&mdash;a
clerk and a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, as long as there was something with trousers
on. Did it ever strike you that she never got into the bath at
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no! What would she want to go there at all for, in
that case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make an impression on the men,&rdquo; replied Mitchell
promptly. &ldquo;She wanted to make out she was nice, and
wholesome, and well-washed, and particular. Made an impression
on&nbsp;<i>you</i>, it seems, or you wouldn&rsquo;t remember
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I suppose so; and, now I come to think of it,
the bath didn&rsquo;t seem to injure her make-up or wet her hair;
but I supposed she held her head from under the shower
somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she make-up so early in the morning?&rdquo; asked
Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unusual; but it might have been so where
there was a lot of boarders. And about the hair&mdash;that
didn&rsquo;t count for anything, because washing-the-head
ain&rsquo;t supposed to be always included in a lady&rsquo;s bath;
it&rsquo;s only supposed to be washed once a fortnight, and some
don&rsquo;t do it once a month. The hair takes so long to dry; it
don&rsquo;t matter so much if the woman&rsquo;s got short, scraggy
hair; but if a girl&rsquo;s hair was down to her waist it would
take hours to dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how do they manage it without wetting their
heads?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy enough. They have a little oilskin
cap that fits tight over the forehead, and they put it on, and
bunch their hair up in it when they go under the shower. Did you
ever see a woman sit in a sunny place with her hair down after
having a wash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I used to see one do that regular where I was
staying; but I thought she only did it to show off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;she was drying her hair; though perhaps
she was showing off at the same time, for she wouldn&rsquo;t sit
where you&mdash;or even a Chinaman&mdash; could see her, if she
didn&rsquo;t think she had a good head of hair.
Now,&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;tell you a yarn about a
woman&rsquo;s bath. I was stopping at a shabby-genteel
boarding-house in Melbourne once, and one very cold winter, too;
and there was a rather good-looking woman there, looking for a
husband. She used to go down to the bath every morning, no matter
how cold it was, and flounder and splash about as if she enjoyed
it, till you&rsquo;d feel as though you&rsquo;d like to go and
catch hold of her and wrap her in a rug and carry her in to the
fire and nurse her till she was warm again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell&rsquo;s mate moved uneasily, and crossed the other leg;
he seemed greatly interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she never went into the water at all!&rdquo;
continued Mitchell. &ldquo;As soon as one or two of the men was up
in the morning she&rsquo;d come down from her room in a
dressing-gown. It was a toney dressing-gown, too, and set her off
properly. She knew how to dress, anyway; most of that sort of women
do. The gown was a kind of green colour, with pink and white
flowers all over it, and red lining, and a lot of coffee-coloured
lace round the neck and down the front. Well, she&rsquo;d come
tripping downstairs and along the passage, holding up one side of
the gown to show her little bare white foot in a slipper; and in
the other hand she carried her tooth-brush and bath-brush, and
soap&mdash;like this&mdash;so&rsquo;s we all could see &rsquo;em;
trying to make out she was too particular to use soap after anyone
else. She could afford to buy her own soap, anyhow; it was hardly
ever wet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;d go into the bathroom and turn on the
tap and shower; when she got about three inches of water in the
bath, she&rsquo;d step in, holding up her gown out of the water,
and go slithering and kicking up and down the bath, like this,
making a tremendous splashing. Of course she&rsquo;d turn off the
shower first, and screw it off very tight&mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t do
to let that leak, you know; she might get wet; but she&rsquo;d
leave the other tap on, so as to make all the more
noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you come to know all about this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the servant girl told me. One morning she twigged her
through a corner of the bathroom window that the curtain
didn&rsquo;t cover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to have been pretty thick with servant
girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do you with landladies! But never mind&mdash;let me
finish the yarn. When she thought she&rsquo;d splashed enough,
she&rsquo;d get out, wipe her feet, wash her face and hands, and
carefully unbutton the two top buttons of her gown; then throw a
towel over her head and shoulders, and listen at the door till she
thought she heard some of the men moving about. Then she&rsquo;d
start for her room, and, if she met one of the men-boarders in the
passage or on the stairs, she&rsquo;d drop her eyes, and pretend to
see for the first time that the top of her dressing-gown
wasn&rsquo;t buttoned&mdash; and she&rsquo;d give a little start
and grab the gown and scurry off to her room buttoning it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sometimes she&rsquo;d come skipping into the
breakfast-room late, looking awfully sweet in her dressing-gown;
and if she saw any of us there, she&rsquo;d pretend to be much
startled, and say that she thought all the men had gone out, and
make as though she was going to clear; and someone &lsquo;d jump up
and give her a chair, while someone else said, &lsquo;Come in, Miss
Brown! come in! Don&rsquo;t let us frighten you. Come right in, and
have your breakfast before it gets cold.&rsquo; So she&rsquo;d
flutter a bit in pretty confusion, and then make a sweet little
girly-girly dive for her chair, and tuck her feet away under the
table; and she&rsquo;d blush, too, but I don&rsquo;t know how she
managed that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know another trick that women have; it&rsquo;s mostly
played by private barmaids. That is, to leave a stocking by
accident in the bathroom for the gentlemen to find. If the
barmaid&rsquo;s got a nice foot and ankle, she uses one of her own
stockings; but if she hasn&rsquo;t she gets hold of a stocking that
belongs to a girl that has. Anyway, she&rsquo;ll have one readied
up somehow. The stocking must be worn and nicely darned; one
that&rsquo;s been worn will keep the shape of the leg and
foot&mdash;at least till it&rsquo;s washed again. Well, the barmaid
generally knows what time the gentlemen go to bath, and
she&rsquo;ll make it a point of going down just as a
gentleman&rsquo;s going. Of course he&rsquo;ll give her the
preference&mdash;let her go first, you know&mdash; and she&rsquo;ll
go in and accidentally leave the stocking in a place where
he&rsquo;s sure to see it, and when she comes out he&rsquo;ll go in
and find it; and very likely he&rsquo;ll be a jolly sort of fellow,
and when they&rsquo;re all sitting down to breakfast he&rsquo;ll
come in and ask them to guess what he&rsquo;s found, and then
he&rsquo;ll hold up the stocking. The barmaid likes this sort of
thing; but she&rsquo;ll hold down her head, and pretend to be
confused, and keep her eyes on her plate, and there&rsquo;ll be
much blushing and all that sort of thing, and perhaps she&rsquo;ll
gammon to be mad at him, and the landlady&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Oh,
Mr. Smith! how can yer? At the breakfast table, too!&rsquo; and
they&rsquo;ll all laugh and look at the barmaid, and she&rsquo;ll
get more embarrassed than ever, and spill her tea, and make out as
though the stocking didn&rsquo;t belong to her.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="NoPlaceforaWoman" id=

</h2>

<p>He had a selection on a long box-scrub siding of the ridges,
about half a mile back and up from the coach road. There were no
neighbours that I ever heard of, and the nearest &ldquo;town&rdquo;
was thirty miles away. He grew wheat among the stumps of his
clearing, sold the crop standing to a Cockie who lived ten miles
away, and had some surplus sons; or, some seasons, he reaped it by
hand, had it thrashed by travelling &ldquo;steamer&rdquo; (portable
steam engine and machine), and carried the grain, a few bags at a
time, into the mill on his rickety dray.</p>

<p>He had lived alone for upwards of 15 years, and was known to
those who knew him as &ldquo;Ratty Howlett&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Trav&rsquo;lers and strangers failed to see anything uncommonly
ratty about him. It was known, or, at least, it was believed,
without question, that while at work he kept his horse saddled and
bridled, and hung up to the fence, or grazing about, with the
saddle on&mdash;or, anyway, close handy for a moment&rsquo;s
notice&mdash;and whenever he caught sight, over the scrub and
through the quarter-mile break in it, of a traveller on the road,
he would jump on his horse and make after him. If it was a horseman
he usually pulled him up inside of a mile. Stories were told of
unsuccessful chases, misunderstandings, and complications arising
out of Howlett&rsquo;s mania for running down and bailing up
travellers. Sometimes he caught one every day for a week, sometimes
not one for weeks&mdash;it was a lonely track.</p>

<p>The explanation was simple, sufficient, and perfectly
natural&mdash;from a bushman&rsquo;s point of view. Ratty only
wanted to have a yarn. He and the traveller would camp in the shade
for half an hour or so and yarn and smoke. The old man would find
out where the traveller came from, and how long he&rsquo;d been
there, and where he was making for, and how long he reckoned
he&rsquo;d be away; and ask if there had been any rain along the
traveller&rsquo;s back track, and how the country looked after the
drought; and he&rsquo;d get the traveller&rsquo;s ideas on abstract
questions&mdash; if he had any. If it was a footman (swagman), and
he was short of tobacco, old Howlett always had half a stick ready
for him. Sometimes, but very rarely, he&rsquo;d invite the swagman
back to the hut for a pint of tea, or a bit of meat, flour, tea, or
sugar, to carry him along the track.</p>

<p>And, after the yarn by the road, they said, the old man would
ride back, refreshed, to his lonely selection, and work on into the
night as long as he could see his solitary old plough horse, or the
scoop of his long-handled shovel.</p>

<p>And so it was that I came to make his acquaintance&mdash;or,
rather, that he made mine. I was cantering easily along the track
&mdash;I was making for the north-west with a pack horse&mdash;when
about a mile beyond the track to the selection I heard, &ldquo;Hi,
Mister!&rdquo; and saw a dust cloud following me. I had heard of
&ldquo;Old Ratty Howlett&rdquo; casually, and so was prepared for
him.</p>

<p>A tall gaunt man on a little horse. He was clean-shaven, except
for a frill beard round under his chin, and his long wavy, dark
hair was turning grey; a square, strong-faced man, and reminded me
of one full-faced portrait of Gladstone more than any other face I
had seen. He had large reddish-brown eyes, deep set under heavy
eyebrows, and with something of the blackfellow in them&mdash;the
sort of eyes that will peer at something on the horizon that no one
else can see. He had a way of talking to the horizon,
too&mdash;more than to his companion; and he had a deep vertical
wrinkle in his forehead that no smile could lessen.</p>

<p>I got down and got out my pipe, and we sat on a log and yarned
awhile on bush subjects; and then, after a pause, he shifted
uneasily, it seemed to me, and asked rather abruptly, and in an
altered tone, if I was married. A queer question to ask a
traveller; more especially in my case, as I was little more than a
boy then.</p>

<p>He talked on again of old things and places where we had both
been, and asked after men he knew, or had known&mdash;drovers and
others&mdash;and whether they were living yet. Most of his
inquiries went back before my time; but some of the drovers, one or
two overlanders with whom he had been mates in his time, had grown
old into mine, and I knew them. I notice now, though I didn&rsquo;t
then&mdash;and if I had it would not have seemed strange from a
bush point of view&mdash;that he didn&rsquo;t ask for news, nor
seem interested in it.</p>

<p>Then after another uneasy pause, during which he scratched
crosses in the dust with a stick, he asked me, in the same queer
tone and without looking at me or looking up, if I happened to know
anything about doctoring&mdash;if I&rsquo;d ever studied it.</p>

<p>I asked him if anyone was sick at his place. He hesitated, and
said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then I wanted to know why he had asked me
that question, and he was so long about answering that I began to
think he was hard of hearing, when, at last, he muttered something
about my face reminding him of a young fellow he knew of
who&rsquo;d gone to Sydney to &ldquo;study for a doctor&rdquo;.
That might have been, and looked natural enough; but why
didn&rsquo;t he ask me straight out if I was the chap he
&ldquo;knowed of&rdquo;? Travellers do not like beating about the
bush in conversation.</p>

<p>He sat in silence for a good while, with his arms folded, and
looking absently away over the dead level of the great scrubs that
spread from the foot of the ridge we were on to where a blue peak
or two of a distant range showed above the bush on the horizon.</p>

<p>I stood up and put my pipe away and stretched. Then he seemed to
wake up. &ldquo;Better come back to the hut and have a bit of
dinner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The missus will about have it ready,
and I&rsquo;ll spare you a handful of hay for the
horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hay decided it. It was a dry season. I was surprised to hear
of a wife, for I thought he was a hatter&mdash;I had always heard
so; but perhaps I had been mistaken, and he had married lately; or
had got a housekeeper. The farm was an irregularly-shaped clearing
in the scrub, with a good many stumps in it, with a broken-down
two-rail fence along the frontage, and logs and
&ldquo;dog-leg&rdquo; the rest. It was about as lonely-looking a
place as I had seen, and I had seen some out-of-the-way,
God-forgotten holes where men lived alone. The hut was in the top
corner, a two-roomed slab hut, with a shingle roof, which must have
been uncommon round there in the days when that hut was built. I
was used to bush carpentering, and saw that the place had been put
up by a man who had plenty of life and hope in front of him, and
for someone else beside himself. But there were two unfinished
skilling rooms built on to the back of the hut; the posts,
sleepers, and wall-plates had been well put up and fitted, and the
slab walls were up, but the roof had never been put on. There was
nothing but burrs and nettles inside those walls, and an old wooden
bullock plough and a couple of yokes were dry-rotting across the
back doorway. The remains of a straw-stack, some hay under a bark
humpy, a small iron plough, and an old stiff coffin-headed grey
draught horse, were all that I saw about the place.</p>

<p>But there was a bit of a surprise for me inside, in the shape of
a clean white tablecloth on the rough slab table which stood on
stakes driven into the ground. The cloth was coarse, but it was a
tablecloth &mdash;not a spare sheet put on in honour of unexpected
visitors&mdash;and perfectly clean. The tin plates, pannikins, and
jam tins that served as sugar bowls and salt cellars were polished
brightly. The walls and fireplace were whitewashed, the clay floor
swept, and clean sheets of newspaper laid on the slab mantleshelf
under the row of biscuit tins that held the groceries. I thought
that his wife, or housekeeper, or whatever she was, was a clean and
tidy woman about a house. I saw no woman; but on the sofa &mdash;a
light, wooden, batten one, with runged arms at the ends&mdash;lay a
woman&rsquo;s dress on a lot of sheets of old stained and faded
newspapers. He looked at it in a puzzled way, knitting his
forehead, then took it up absently and folded it. I saw then that
it was a riding skirt and jacket. He bundled them into the
newspapers and took them into the bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wife was going on a visit down the creek this
afternoon,&rdquo; he said rapidly and without looking at me, but
stooping as if to have another look through the door at those
distant peaks. &ldquo;I suppose she got tired o&rsquo;
waitin&rsquo;, and went and took the daughter with her. But, never
mind, the grub is ready.&rdquo; There was a camp-oven with a leg of
mutton and potatoes sizzling in it on the hearth, and billies
hanging over the fire. I noticed the billies had been scraped, and
the lids polished.</p>

<p>There seemed to be something queer about the whole business, but
then he and his wife might have had a &ldquo;breeze&rdquo; during
the morning. I thought so during the meal, when the subject of
women came up, and he said one never knew how to take a woman,
etc.; but there was nothing in what he said that need necessarily
have referred to his wife or to any woman in particular. For the
rest he talked of old bush things, droving, digging, and old
bushranging&mdash;but never about live things and living men,
unless any of the old mates he talked about happened to be alive by
accident. He was very restless in the house, and never took his hat
off.</p>

<p>There was a dress and a woman&rsquo;s old hat hanging on the
wall near the door, but they looked as if they might have been
hanging there for a lifetime. There seemed something queer about
the whole place&mdash;something wanting; but then all
out-of-the-way bush homes are haunted by that something wanting,
or, more likely, by the spirits of the things that should have been
there, but never had been.</p>

<p>As I rode down the track to the road I looked back and saw old
Howlett hard at work in a hole round a big stump with his
long-handled shovel.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d noticed that he moved and walked with a slight list to
port, and put his hand once or twice to the small of his back, and
I set it down to lumbago, or something of that sort.</p>

<p>Up in the Never Never I heard from a drover who had known
Howlett that his wife had died in the first year, and so this
mysterious woman, if she was his wife, was, of course, his second
wife. The drover seemed surprised and rather amused at the thought
of old Howlett going in for matrimony again.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I rode back that way five years later, from the Never Never. It
was early in the morning&mdash;I had ridden since midnight. I
didn&rsquo;t think the old man would be up and about; and, besides,
I wanted to get on home, and have a look at the old folk, and the
mates I&rsquo;d left behind&mdash;and the girl. But I hadn&rsquo;t
got far past the point where Howlett&rsquo;s track joined the road,
when I happened to look back, and saw him on horseback, stumbling
down the track. I waited till he came up.</p>

<p>He was riding the old grey draught horse this time, and it
looked very much broken down. I thought it would have come down
every step, and fallen like an old rotten humpy in a gust of wind.
And the old man was not much better off. I saw at once that he was
a very sick man. His face was drawn, and he bent forward as if he
was hurt. He got down stiffly and awkwardly, like a hurt man, and
as soon as his feet touched the ground he grabbed my arm, or he
would have gone down like a man who steps off a train in motion. He
hung towards the bank of the road, feeling blindly, as it were, for
the ground, with his free hand, as I eased him down. I got my
blanket and calico from the pack saddle to make him
comfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me with my back agen the tree,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I must sit up&mdash; it&rsquo;s no use lyin&rsquo; me
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat with his hand gripping his side, and breathed
painfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I run up to the hut and get the wife?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He spoke painfully. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Then, as
if the words were jerked out of him by a spasm: &ldquo;She
ain&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took it that she had left him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been bad? How long has this been coming
on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took no notice of the question. I thought it was a touch of
rheumatic fever, or something of that sort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone
into my back and sides now&mdash;the pain&rsquo;s worse in me
back,&rdquo; he said presently.</p>

<p>I had once been mates with a man who died suddenly of heart
disease, while at work. He was washing a dish of dirt in the creek
near a claim we were working; he let the dish slip into the water,
fell back, crying, &ldquo;O, my back!&rdquo; and was gone. And now
I felt by instinct that it was poor old Howlett&rsquo;s heart that
was wrong. A man&rsquo;s heart is in his back as well as in his
arms and hands.</p>

<p>The old man had turned pale with the pallor of a man who turns
faint in a heat wave, and his arms fell loosely, and his hands
rocked helplessly with the knuckles in the dust. I felt myself
turning white, too, and the sick, cold, empty feeling in my
stomach, for I knew the signs. Bushmen stand in awe of sickness and
death.</p>

<p>But after I&rsquo;d fixed him comfortably and given him a drink
from the water bag the greyness left his face, and he pulled
himself together a bit; he drew up his arms and folded them across
his chest. He let his head rest back against the tree&mdash;his
slouch hat had fallen off revealing a broad, white brow, much
higher than I expected. He seemed to gaze on the azure fin of the
range, showing above the dark blue-green bush on the horizon.</p>

<p>Then he commenced to speak&mdash;taking no notice of me when I
asked him if he felt better now&mdash;to talk in that strange,
absent, far-away tone that awes one. He told his story
mechanically, monotonously&mdash;in set words, as I believe now, as
he had often told it before; if not to others, then to the
loneliness of the bush. And he used the names of people and places
that I had never heard of&mdash;just as if I knew them as well as
he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to bring her up the first year. It
was no place for a woman. I wanted her to stay with her people and
wait till I&rsquo;d got the place a little more ship-shape. The
Phippses took a selection down the creek. I wanted her to wait and
come up with them so&rsquo;s she&rsquo;d have some company&mdash; a
woman to talk to. They came afterwards, but they didn&rsquo;t stop.
It was no place for a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mary would come. She wouldn&rsquo;t stop with her
people down country. She wanted to be with me, and look after me,
and work and help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He repeated himself a great deal&mdash;said the same thing over
and over again sometimes. He was only mad on one track. He&rsquo;d
tail off and sit silent for a while; then he&rsquo;d become aware
of me in a hurried, half-scared way, and apologise for putting me
to all that trouble, and thank me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right
d&rsquo;reckly. Best take the horses up to the hut and have some
breakfast; you&rsquo;ll find it by the fire. I&rsquo;ll foller you,
d&rsquo;reckly. The wife&rsquo;ll be waitin&rsquo;
an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He would drop off, and be going
again presently on the old track:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her mother was coming up to stay awhile at the end of the
year, but the old man hurt his leg. Then her married sister was
coming, but one of the youngsters got sick and there was trouble at
home. I saw the doctor in the town&mdash;thirty miles from
here&mdash;and fixed it up with him. He was a
boozer&mdash;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him afterwards. I fixed up
with a woman in the town to come and stay. I thought Mary was wrong
in her time. She must have been a month or six weeks out. But I
listened to her. . . . Don&rsquo;t argue with a woman. Don&rsquo;t
listen to a woman. Do the right thing. We should have had a mother
woman to talk to us. But it was no place for a woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rocked his head, as if from some old agony of mind, against
the tree-trunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was took bad suddenly one night, but it passed off.
False alarm. I was going to ride somewhere, but she said to wait
till daylight. Someone was sure to pass. She was a brave and
sensible girl, but she had a terror of being left alone. It was no
place for a woman!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a black shepherd three or four miles away. I
rode over while Mary was asleep, and started the black boy into
town. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him afterwards if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a
caught him. The old black gin was dead the week before, or Mary
would a&rsquo; bin alright. She was tied up in a bunch with strips
of blanket and greenhide, and put in a hole. So there wasn&rsquo;t
even a gin near the place. It was no place for a woman!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was watchin&rsquo; the road at daylight, and I was
watchin&rsquo; the road at dusk. I went down in the hollow and
stooped down to get the gap agen the sky, so&rsquo;s I could see if
anyone was comin&rsquo; over. . . . I&rsquo;d get on the horse and
gallop along towards the town for five miles, but something would
drag me back, and then I&rsquo;d race for fear she&rsquo;d die
before I got to the hut. I expected the doctor every five
minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It come on about daylight next morning. I ran
back&rsquo;ards and for&rsquo;ards between the hut and the road
like a madman. And no one come. I was running amongst the logs and
stumps, and fallin&rsquo; over them, when I saw a cloud of dust
agen sunrise. It was her mother an&rsquo; sister in the
spring-cart, an&rsquo; just catchin&rsquo; up to them was the
doctor in his buggy with the woman I&rsquo;d arranged with in town.
The mother and sister was staying at the town for the night, when
they heard of the black boy. It took him a day to ride there.
I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a caught him ever
after. The doctor&rsquo;d been on the drunk. If I&rsquo;d had the
gun and known she was gone I&rsquo;d have shot him in the buggy.
They said she was dead. And the child was dead, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They blamed me, but I didn&rsquo;t want her to come; it
was no place for a woman. I never saw them again after the funeral.
I didn&rsquo;t want to see them any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved his head wearily against the tree, and presently
drifted on again in a softer tone&mdash;his eyes and voice were
growing more absent and dreamy and far away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About a month after&mdash;or a year, I lost count of the
time long ago&mdash;she came back to me. At first she&rsquo;d come
in the night, then sometimes when I was at work&mdash;and she had
the baby&mdash;it was a girl&mdash;in her arms. And by-and-bye she
came to stay altogether. . . . I didn&rsquo;t blame her for going
away that time&mdash;it was no place for a woman. . . . She was a
good wife to me. She was a jolly girl when I married her. The
little girl grew up like her. I was going to send her down country
to be educated&mdash;it was no place for a girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a month, or a year, ago, Mary left me, and took the
daughter, and never came back till last night&mdash;this morning, I
think it was. I thought at first it was the girl with her hair done
up, and her mother&rsquo;s skirt on, to surprise her old dad. But
it was Mary, my wife&mdash;as she was when I married her. She said
she couldn&rsquo;t stay, but she&rsquo;d wait for me on the road;
on&mdash;the road. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>His arms fell, and his face went white. I got the water-bag.
&ldquo;Another turn like that and you&rsquo;ll be gone,&rdquo; I
thought, as he came to again. Then I suddenly thought of a shanty
that had been started, when I came that way last, ten or twelve
miles along the road, towards the town. There was nothing for it
but to leave him and ride on for help, and a cart of some kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait here till I come back,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He roused himself a little. &ldquo;Best come up to the hut and
get some grub. The wife&rsquo;ll be waiting. . . .&rdquo; He was
off the track again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you wait while I take the horse down to the
creek?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait by the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the
water-bag handy. Don&rsquo;t move till I come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t move&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait by the
road,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>I took the packhorse, which was the freshest and best, threw the
pack-saddle and bags into a bush, left the other horse to take care
of itself, and started for the shanty, leaving the old man with his
back to the tree, his arms folded, and his eyes on the horizon.</p>

<p>One of the chaps at the shanty rode on for the doctor at once,
while the other came back with me in a spring-cart. He told me that
old Howlett&rsquo;s wife had died in child-birth the first year on
the selection&mdash;&ldquo;she was a fine girl he&rsquo;d
heered!&rdquo; He told me the story as the old man had told it, and
in pretty well the same words, even to giving it as his opinion
that it was no place for a woman. &ldquo;And he
&lsquo;hatted&rsquo; and brooded over it till he went
ratty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew the rest. He not only thought that his wife, or the ghost
of his wife, had been with him all those years, but that the child
had lived and grown up, and that the wife did the housework; which,
of course, he must have done himself.</p>

<p>When we reached him his knotted hands had fallen for the last
time, and they were at rest. I only took one quick look at his
face, but could have sworn that he was gazing at the blue fin of
the range on the horizon of the bush.</p>

<p>Up at the hut the table was set as on the first day I saw it,
and breakfast in the camp-oven by the fire.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellsJobs" id=
"MitchellsJobs"></a>Mitchell&rsquo;s Jobs</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to knock off work and try to make some
money,&rdquo; said Mitchell, as he jerked the tea-leaves out of his
pannikin and reached for the billy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been the
great mistake of my life &mdash; if I hadn&rsquo;t wasted all my
time and energy working and looking for work I might have been an
independent man to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; he added in a louder voice, condescendingly
adapting his language to my bushed comprehension. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to sling graft and try and get some stuff
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel in a responsive humour, but I lit up and
settled back comfortably against the tree, and Jack folded his arms
on his knees and presently continued, reflectively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember the first time I went to work. I was a
youngster then. Mother used to go round looking for jobs for me.
She reckoned, perhaps, that I was too shy to go in where there was
a boy wanted and barrack for myself properly, and she used to help
me and see me through to the best of her ability. I&rsquo;m afraid
I didn&rsquo;t always feel as grateful to her as I should have
felt. I was a thankless kid at the best of times &mdash; most kids
are &mdash; but otherwise I was a straight enough little chap as
nippers go. Sometimes I almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t been. My
relations would have thought a good deal more of me and treated me
better &mdash; and, besides, it&rsquo;s a comfort, at times, to sit
and watch the sun going down in the bed of the bush, and think of
your wicked childhood and wasted life, and the way you treated your
parents and broke their hearts, and feel just properly repentant
and bitter and remorseful and low-spirited about it when it&rsquo;s
too late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well! . . . I generally did feel a bit backward in
going in when I came to the door of an office or shop where there
was a &lsquo;Strong Lad&rsquo;, or a &lsquo;Willing Youth&rsquo;,
wanted inside to make himself generally useful. I was a strong lad
and a willing youth enough, in some things, for that matter; but I
didn&rsquo;t like to see it written up on a card in a shop window,
and I didn&rsquo;t want to make myself generally useful in a close
shop in a hot dusty street on mornings when the weather was fine
and the great sunny rollers were coming in grand on the Bondi Beach
and down at Coogee, and I could swim. . . . I&rsquo;d give
something to be down along there now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mitchell looked away out over the sultry sandy plain that we
were to tackle next day, and sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first job I got was in a jam factory. They only had
&lsquo;Boy Wanted&rsquo; on the card in the window, and I thought
it would suit me. They set me to work to peel peaches, and, as soon
as the foreman&rsquo;s back was turned, I picked out a
likely-looking peach and tried it. They soaked those peaches in
salt or acid or something &mdash; it was part of the process
&mdash; and I had to spit it out. Then I got an orange from a boy
who was slicing them, but it was bitter, and I couldn&rsquo;t eat
it. I saw that I&rsquo;d been had properly. I was in a fix, and had
to get out of it the best way I could. I&rsquo;d left my coat down
in the front shop, and the foreman and boss were there, so I had to
work in that place for two mortal hours. It was about the longest
two hours I&rsquo;d ever spent in my life. At last the foreman came
up, and I told him I wanted to go down to the back for a minute. I
slipped down, watched my chance till the boss&rsquo; back was
turned, got my coat, and cleared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next job I got was in a mat factory; at least, Aunt
got that for me. I didn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with
mats or carpets. The worst of it was the boss didn&rsquo;t seem to
want me to go, and I had a job to get him to sack me, and when he
did he saw some of my people and took me back again next week. He
sacked me finally the next Saturday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got the next job myself. I didn&rsquo;t hurry; I took
my time and picked out a good one. It was in a lolly factory. I
thought it would suit me &mdash; and it did, for a while. They put
me on stirring up and mixing stuff in the jujube department; but I
got so sick of the smell of it and so full of jujube and other
lollies that I soon wanted a change; so I had a row with the chief
of the jujube department and the boss gave me the sack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got a job in a grocery then. I thought I&rsquo;d have
more variety there. But one day the boss was away, sick or
something, all the afternoon, and I sold a lot of things too cheap.
I didn&rsquo;t know. When a customer came in and asked for
something I&rsquo;d just look round in the window till I saw a card
with the price written up on it, and sell the best quality
according to that price; and once or twice I made a mistake the
other way about and lost a couple of good customers. It was a hot,
drowsy afternoon, and by-and-bye I began to feel dull and sleepy.
So I looked round the corner and saw a Chinaman coming. I got a big
tin garden syringe and filled it full of brine from the butter keg,
and, when he came opposite the door, I let him have the full force
of it in the ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Chinaman put down his baskets and came for me. I was
strong for my age, and thought I could fight, but he gave me a
proper mauling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was like running up against a thrashing machine, and
it wouldn&rsquo;t have been well for me if the boss of the shop
next door hadn&rsquo;t interfered. He told my boss, and my boss
gave me the sack at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took a spell of eighteen months or so after that, and
was growing up happy and contented when a married sister of mine
must needs come to live in town and interfere. I didn&rsquo;t like
married sisters, though I always got on grand with my
brothers-in-law, and wished there were more of them. The married
sister comes round and cleans up the place and pulls your things
about and finds your pipe and tobacco and things, and cigarette
portraits, and &ldquo;Deadwood Dicks&rdquo;, that you&rsquo;ve got
put away all right, so&rsquo;s your mother and aunt wouldn&rsquo;t
find them in a generation of cats, and says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother, why don&rsquo;t you make that boy go to
work. It&rsquo;s a scandalous shame to see a big boy like that
growing up idle. He&rsquo;s going to the bad before your
eyes.&rsquo; And she&rsquo;s always trying to make out that
you&rsquo;re a liar, and trying to make mother believe it, too. My
married sister got me a job with a chemist, whose missus she
knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got on pretty well there, and by-and-bye I was put
upstairs in the grinding and mixing department; but, after a while,
they put another boy that I was chummy with up there with me, and
that was a mistake. I didn&rsquo;t think so at the time, but I can
see it now. We got up to all sorts of tricks. We&rsquo;d get mixing
together chemicals that weren&rsquo;t related to see how
they&rsquo;d agree, and we nearly blew up the shop several times,
and set it on fire once. But all the chaps liked us, and fixed
things up for us. One day we got a big black dog &mdash; that we
meant to take home that evening &mdash; and sneaked him upstairs
and put him on a flat roof outside the laboratory. He had a touch
of the mange and didn&rsquo;t look well, so we gave him a dose of
something; and he scrambled over the parapet and slipped down a
steep iron roof in front, and fell on a respected townsman that
knew my people. We were awfully frightened, and didn&rsquo;t say
anything. Nobody saw it but us. The dog had the presence of mind to
leave at once, and the respected townsman was picked up and taken
home in a cab; and he got it hot from his wife, too, I believe, for
being in that drunken, beastly state in the main street in the
middle of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was ever quite sure that he
hadn&rsquo;t been drunk or what had happened, for he had had one or
two that morning; so it didn&rsquo;t matter much. Only we lost the
dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day I went downstairs to the packing-room and saw a
lot of phosphorus in jars of water. I wanted to fix up a ghost for
Billy, my mate, so I nicked a bit and slipped it into my trouser
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stood under the tap and let it pour on me. The
phosphorus burnt clean through my pocket and fell on the ground. I
was sent home that night with my leg dressed with lime-water and
oil, and a pair of the boss&rsquo;s pants on that were about half a
yard too long for me, and I felt miserable enough, too. They said
it would stop my tricks for a while, and so it did. I&rsquo;ll
carry the mark to my dying day &mdash; and for two or three days
after, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I fell asleep at this point, and left Mitchell&rsquo;s cattle
pup to hear it out.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BilltheVentriloquialRooster" id=
"BilltheVentriloquialRooster"></a>Bill, the Ventriloquial
Rooster</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;When we were up country on the selection, we had a
rooster at our place, named Bill,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;a
big mongrel of no particular breed, though the old lady said he was
a &lsquo;brammer&rsquo;&mdash;and many an argument she had with the
old man about it too; she was just as stubborn and obstinate in her
opinion as the governor was in his. But, anyway, we called him
Bill, and didn&rsquo;t take any particular notice of him till a
cousin of some of us came from Sydney on a visit to the country,
and stayed at our place because it was cheaper than stopping at a
pub. Well, somehow this chap got interested in Bill, and studied
him for two or three days, and at last he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, that rooster&rsquo;s a
ventriloquist!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A what?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A ventriloquist!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go along with yer!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he is. I&rsquo;ve heard of cases like this
before; but this is the first I&rsquo;ve come across. Bill&rsquo;s
a ventriloquist right enough.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we remembered that there wasn&rsquo;t another
rooster within five miles &mdash;our only neighbour, an Irishman
named Page, didn&rsquo;t have one at the time&mdash; and we&rsquo;d
often heard another cock crow, but didn&rsquo;t think to take any
notice of it. We watched Bill, and sure enough he <i>was</i> a
ventriloquist. The &lsquo;ka-cocka&rsquo; would come all right, but
the &lsquo;co-ka-koo-oi-oo&rsquo; seemed to come from a distance.
And sometimes the whole crow would go wrong, and come back like an
echo that had been lost for a year. Bill would stand on tiptoe, and
hold his elbows out, and curve his neck, and go two or three times
as if he was swallowing nest-eggs, and nearly break his neck and
burst his gizzard; and then there&rsquo;d be no sound at all where
he was&mdash;only a cock crowing in the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pretty soon we could see that Bill was in great
trouble about it himself. You see, he didn&rsquo;t know it was
himself&mdash;thought it was another rooster challenging him, and
he wanted badly to find that other bird. He would get up on the
wood-heap, and crow and listen&mdash;crow and listen again&mdash;
crow and listen, and then he&rsquo;d go up to the top of the
paddock, and get up on the stack, and crow and listen there. Then
down to the other end of the paddock, and get up on a mullock-heap,
and crow and listen there. Then across to the other side and up on
a log among the saplings, and crow &lsquo;n&rsquo; listen some
more. He searched all over the place for that other rooster, but,
of course, couldn&rsquo;t find him. Sometimes he&rsquo;d be out all
day crowing and listening all over the country, and then come home
dead tired, and rest and cool off in a hole that the hens had
scratched for him in a damp place under the water-cask sledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one day Page brought home a big white rooster, and
when he let it go it climbed up on Page&rsquo;s stack and crowed,
to see if there was any more roosters round there. Bill had come
home tired; it was a hot day, and he&rsquo;d rooted out the hens,
and was having a spell-oh under the cask when the white rooster
crowed. Bill didn&rsquo;t lose any time getting out and on to the
wood-heap, and then he waited till he heard the crow again; then he
crowed, and the other rooster crowed again, and they crowed at each
other for three days, and called each other all the wretches they
could lay their tongues to, and after that they implored each other
to come out and be made into chicken soup and feather pillows. But
neither&rsquo;d come. You see, there were <i>three</i>
crows&mdash;there was Bill&rsquo;s crow, and the ventriloquist
crow, and the white rooster&rsquo;s crow&mdash; and each rooster
thought that there was <i>two</i> roosters in the opposition camp,
and that he mightn&rsquo;t get fair play, and, consequently, both
were afraid to put up their hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at last Bill couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. He
made up his mind to go and have it out, even if there was a whole
agricultural show of prize and honourable-mention fighting-cocks in
Page&rsquo;s yard. He got down from the wood-heap and started off
across the ploughed field, his head down, his elbows out, and his
thick awkward legs prodding away at the furrows behind for all they
were worth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to go down badly and see the fight, and barrack
for Bill. But I daren&rsquo;t, because I&rsquo;d been coming up the
road late the night before with my brother Joe, and there was about
three panels of turkeys roosting along on the top rail of
Page&rsquo;s front fence; and we brushed &rsquo;em with a bough,
and they got up such a blessed gobbling fuss about it that Page
came out in his shirt and saw us running away; and I knew he was
laying for us with a bullock whip. Besides, there was friction
between the two families on account of a thoroughbred bull that
Page borrowed and wouldn&rsquo;t lend to us, and that got into our
paddock on account of me mending a panel in the party fence, and
carelessly leaving the top rail down after sundown while our cows
was moving round there in the saplings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there was too much friction for me to go down, but I
climbed a tree as near the fence as I could and watched. Bill
reckoned he&rsquo;d found that rooster at last. The white rooster
wouldn&rsquo;t come down from the stack, so Bill went up to him,
and they fought there till they tumbled down the other side, and I
couldn&rsquo;t see any more. Wasn&rsquo;t I wild? I&rsquo;d have
given my dog to have seen the rest of the fight. I went down to the
far side of Page&rsquo;s fence and climbed a tree there, but, of
course, I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, so I came home the back way.
Just as I got home Page came round to the front and sung out,
&lsquo;Insoid there!&rsquo; And me and Jim went under the house
like snakes and looked out round a pile. But Page was all
right&mdash;he had a broad grin on his face, and Bill safe under
his arm. He put Bill down on the ground very carefully, and says he
to the old folks:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yer rooster knocked the stuffin&rsquo; out of my
rooster, but I bear no malice. &rsquo;Twas a grand
foight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then the old man and Page had a yarn, and got pretty
friendly after that. And Bill didn&rsquo;t seem to bother about any
more ventriloquism; but the white rooster spent a lot of time
looking for that other rooster. Perhaps he thought he&rsquo;d have
better luck with him. But Page was on the look-out all the time to
get a rooster that would lick ours. He did nothing else for a month
but ride round and enquire about roosters; and at last he borrowed
a game-bird in town, left five pounds deposit on him, and brought
him home. And Page and the old man agreed to have a match&mdash;
about the only thing they&rsquo;d agreed about for five years. And
they fixed it up for a Sunday when the old lady and the girls and
kids were going on a visit to some relations, about fifteen miles
away&mdash; to stop all night. The guv&rsquo;nor made me go with
them on horseback; but I knew what was up, and so my pony went lame
about a mile along the road, and I had to come back and turn him
out in the top paddock, and hide the saddle and bridle in a hollow
log, and sneak home and climb up on the roof of the shed. It was a
awful hot day, and I had to keep climbing backward and forward over
the ridge-pole all the morning to keep out of sight of the old man,
for he was moving about a good deal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after dinner, the fellows from roundabout began to
ride in and hang up their horses round the place till it looked as
if there was going to be a funeral. Some of the chaps saw me, of
course, but I tipped them the wink, and they gave me the office
whenever the old man happened around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Page came along with his game-rooster. Its name was
Jim. It wasn&rsquo;t much to look at, and it seemed a good deal
smaller and weaker than Bill. Some of the chaps were disgusted, and
said it wasn&rsquo;t a game-rooster at all; Bill&rsquo;d settle it
in one lick, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have any fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they brought the game one out and put him down near
the wood-heap, and rousted Bill out from under his cask. He got
interested at once. He looked at Jim, and got up on the wood-heap
and crowed and looked at Jim again. He reckoned <i>this</i> at last
was the fowl that had been humbugging him all along. Presently his
trouble caught him, and then he&rsquo;d crow and take a squint at
the game &rsquo;un, and crow again, and have another squint at
gamey, and try to crow and keep his eye on the game-rooster at the
same time. But Jim never committed himself, until at last he
happened to gape just after Bill&rsquo;s whole crow went wrong, and
Bill spotted him. He reckoned he&rsquo;d caught him this time, and
he got down off that wood-heap and went for the foe. But Jim ran
away&mdash;and Bill ran after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Round and round the wood-heap they went, and round the
shed, and round the house and under it, and back again, and round
the wood-heap and over it and round the other way, and kept it up
for close on an hour. Bill&rsquo;s bill was just within an inch or
so of the game-rooster&rsquo;s tail feathers most of the time, but
he couldn&rsquo;t get any nearer, do how he liked. And all the time
the fellers kept chyackin Page and singing out, &lsquo;What price
yer game &rsquo;un, Page! Go it, Bill! Go it, old cock!&rsquo; and
all that sort of thing. Well, the game-rooster went as if it was a
go-as-you-please, and he didn&rsquo;t care if it lasted a year. He
didn&rsquo;t seem to take any interest in the business, but Bill
got excited, and by-and-by he got mad. He held his head lower and
lower and his wings further and further out from his sides, and
prodded away harder and harder at the ground behind, but it
wasn&rsquo;t any use. Jim seemed to keep ahead without trying. They
stuck to the wood-heap towards the last. They went round first one
way for a while, and then the other for a change, and now and then
they&rsquo;d go over the top to break the monotony; and the chaps
got more interested in the race than they would have been in the
fight&mdash;and bet on it, too. But Bill was handicapped with his
weight. He was done up at last; he slowed down till he
couldn&rsquo;t waddle, and then, when he was thoroughly knocked up,
that game-rooster turned on him, and gave him the father of a
hiding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my father caught me when I&rsquo;d got down in the
excitement, and wasn&rsquo;t thinking, and <i>he</i> gave <i>me</i>
the step-father of a hiding. But he had a lively time with the old
lady afterwards, over the cock-fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bill was so disgusted with himself that he went under the
cask and died.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BushCats" id="BushCats"></a>Bush
Cats</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Domestic cats&rdquo; we mean&mdash;the descendants of
cats who came from the northern world during the last hundred odd
years. We do not know the name of the vessel in which the first
Thomas and his Maria came out to Australia, but we suppose that it
was one of the ships of the First Fleet. Most likely Maria had
kittens on the voyage &mdash;two lots, perhaps&mdash;the majority
of which were buried at sea; and no doubt the disembarkation caused
her much maternal anxiety.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>The feline race has not altered much in Australia, from a
physical point of view&mdash;not yet. The rabbit has developed into
something like a cross between a kangaroo and a possum, but the
bush has not begun to develop the common cat. She is just as sedate
and motherly as the mummy cats of Egypt were, but she takes longer
strolls of nights, climbs gum-trees instead of roofs, and hunts
stranger vermin than ever came under the observation of her
northern ancestors. Her views have widened. She is mostly thinner
than the English farm cat&mdash; which is, they say, on account of
eating lizards.</p>

<p>English rats and English mice&mdash;we say &ldquo;English&rdquo;
because everything which isn&rsquo;t Australian in Australia,
<i>is</i> English (or British)&mdash; English rats and English mice
are either rare or non-existent in the bush; but the hut cat has a
wider range for game. She is always dragging in things which are
unknown in the halls of zoology; ugly, loathsome, crawling
abortions which have not been classified yet&mdash;and perhaps
could not be.</p>

<p>The Australian zoologist ought to rake up some more dead
languages, and then go Out Back with a few bush cats.</p>

<p>The Australian bush cat has a nasty, unpleasant habit of
dragging a long, wriggling, horrid, black snake&mdash;she seems to
prefer black snakes&mdash;into a room where there are ladies,
proudly laying it down in a conspicuous place (usually in front of
the exit), and then looking up for approbation. She wonders,
perhaps, why the visitors are in such a hurry to leave.</p>

<p>Pussy doesn&rsquo;t approve of live snakes round the place,
especially if she has kittens; and if she finds a snake in the
vicinity of her progeny&mdash; well, it is bad for that particular
serpent.</p>

<p>This brings recollections of a neighbour&rsquo;s cat who went
out in the scrub, one midsummer&rsquo;s day, and found a brown
snake. Her name &mdash;the cat&rsquo;s name&mdash;was Mary Ann. She
got hold of the snake all right, just within an inch of its head;
but it got the rest of its length wound round her body and squeezed
about eight lives out of her. She had the presence of mind to keep
her hold; but it struck her that she was in a fix, and that if she
wanted to save her ninth life, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to
go home for help. So she started home, snake and all.</p>

<p>The family were at dinner when Mary Ann came in, and, although
she stood on an open part of the floor, no one noticed her for a
while. She couldn&rsquo;t ask for help, for her mouth was too full
of snake. By-and-bye one of the girls glanced round, and then went
over the table, with a shriek, and out of the back door. The room
was cleared very quickly. The eldest boy got a long-handled shovel,
and in another second would have killed more cat than snake; but
his father interfered. The father was a shearer, and Mary Ann was a
favourite cat with him. He got a pair of shears from the shelf and
deftly shore off the snake&rsquo;s head, and one side of Mary
Ann&rsquo;s whiskers. She didn&rsquo;t think it safe to let go yet.
She kept her teeth in the neck until the selector snipped the rest
of the snake off her. The bits were carried out on a shovel to die
at sundown. Mary Ann had a good drink of milk, and then got her
tongue out and licked herself back into the proper shape for a cat;
after which she went out to look for that snake&rsquo;s mate. She
found it, too, and dragged it home the same evening.</p>

<p>Cats will kill rabbits and drag them home. We knew a fossicker
whose cat used to bring him a bunny nearly every night. The
fossicker had rabbits for breakfast until he got sick of them, and
then he used to swap them with a butcher for meat. The cat was
named Ingersoll, which indicates his sex and gives an inkling to
his master&rsquo;s religious and political opinions. Ingersoll used
to prospect round in the gloaming until he found some rabbit holes
which showed encouraging indications. He would shepherd one hole
for an hour or so every evening until he found it was a duffer, or
worked it out; then he would shift to another. One day he
prospected a big hollow log with a lot of holes in it, and more
going down underneath. The indications were very good, but
Ingersoll had no luck. The game had too many ways of getting out
and in. He found that he could not work that claim by himself, so
he floated it into a company. He persuaded several cats from a
neighbouring selection to take shares, and they watched the holes
together, or in turns&mdash;they worked shifts. The dividends more
than realised even their wildest expectations, for each cat took
home at least one rabbit every night for a week.</p>

<p>A selector started a vegetable garden about the time when
rabbits were beginning to get troublesome up country. The hare had
not shown itself yet. The farmer kept quite a regiment of cats to
protect his garden&mdash;and they protected it. He would shut the
cats up all day with nothing to eat, and let them out about
sundown; then they would mooch off to the turnip patch like
farm-labourers going to work. They would drag the rabbits home to
the back door, and sit there and watch them until the farmer opened
the door and served out the ration of milk. Then the cats would
turn in. He nearly always found a semi-circle of dead rabbits and
watchful cats round the door in the morning. They sold the product
of their labour direct to the farmer for milk. It didn&rsquo;t
matter if one cat had been unlucky &mdash;had not got a
rabbit&mdash;each had an equal share in the general result. They
were true socialists, those cats.</p>

<p>One of those cats was a mighty big Tom, named Jack. He was death
on rabbits; he would work hard all night, laying for them and
dragging them home. Some weeks he would graft every night, and at
other times every other night, but he was generally pretty regular.
When he reckoned he had done an extra night&rsquo;s work, he would
take the next night off and go three miles to the nearest
neighbour&rsquo;s to see his Maria and take her out for a stroll.
Well, one evening Jack went into the garden and chose a place where
there was good cover, and lay low. He was a bit earlier than usual,
so he thought he would have a doze till rabbit time. By-and-bye he
heard a noise, and slowly, cautiously opening one eye, he saw two
big ears sticking out of the leaves in front of him. He judged that
it was an extra big bunny, so he put some extra style into his
manoeuvres. In about five minutes he made his spring. He must have
thought (if cats think) that it was a whopping, old-man rabbit, for
it was a pioneer hare&mdash;not an ordinary English hare, but one
of those great coarse, lanky things which the bush is breeding. The
selector was attracted by an unusual commotion and a cloud of dust
among his cabbages, and came along with his gun in time to witness
the fight. First Jack would drag the hare, and then the hare would
drag Jack; sometimes they would be down together, and then Jack
would use his hind claws with effect; finally he got his teeth in
the right place, and triumphed. Then he started to drag the corpse
home, but he had to give it best and ask his master to lend a hand.
The selector took up the hare, and Jack followed home, much to the
family&rsquo;s surprise. He did not go back to work that night; he
took a spell. He had a drink of milk, licked the dust off himself,
washed it down with another drink, and sat in front of the fire and
thought for a goodish while. Then he got up, walked over to the
corner where the hare was lying, had a good look at it, came back
to the fire, sat down again, and thought hard. He was still
thinking when the family retired.</p>

</h2>

<h3 align="center"><b>I<br>
Tom Smith</b>
</h3>

<p>You are getting well on in the thirties, and haven&rsquo;t left
off being a fool yet. You have been away in another colony or
country for a year or so, and have now come back again. Most of
your chums have gone away or got married, or, worse still, signed
the pledge&mdash; settled down and got steady; and you feel lonely
and desolate and left-behind enough for anything. While drifting
aimlessly round town with an eye out for some chance acquaintance
to have a knock round with, you run against an old chum whom you
never dreamt of meeting, or whom you thought to be in some other
part of the country&mdash; or perhaps you knock up against someone
who knows the old chum in question, and he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Tom Smith&rsquo;s in
Sydney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Smith! Why, I thought he was in Queensland! I
haven&rsquo;t seen him for more than three years. Where&rsquo;s the
old joker hanging out at all? Why, except you, there&rsquo;s no one
in Australia I&rsquo;d sooner see than Tom Smith. Here I&rsquo;ve
been mooning round like an unemployed for three weeks, looking for
someone to have a knock round with, and Tom in Sydney all the time.
I wish I&rsquo;d known before. Where&rsquo;ll I run against
him&mdash; where does he live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s living at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s his home? I was never there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll give you his address. . . . There, I think
that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m not sure about the number, but
you&rsquo;ll soon find out in that street&mdash; most of
&rsquo;em&rsquo;ll know Tom Smith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks! I rather think they will. I&rsquo;m glad I met
you. I&rsquo;ll hunt Tom up to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So you put a few shillings in your pocket, tell your landlady
that you&rsquo;re going to visit an old aunt of yours or a sick
friend, and mayn&rsquo;t be home that night; and then you start out
to hunt up Tom Smith and have at least one more good night, if you
die for it.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>This is the first time you have seen Tom at home; you knew of
his home and people in the old days, but only in a vague,
indefinite sort of way. Tom has changed! He is stouter and
older-looking; he seems solemn and settled down. You intended to
give him a surprise and have a good old jolly laugh with him, but
somehow things get suddenly damped at the beginning. He grins and
grips your hand right enough, but there seems something wanting.
You can&rsquo;t help staring at him, and he seems to look at you in
a strange, disappointing way; it doesn&rsquo;t strike you that you
also have changed, and perhaps more in his eyes than he in yours.
He introduces you to his mother and sisters and brothers, and the
rest of the family; or to his wife, as the case may be; and you
have to suppress your feelings and be polite and talk common-place.
You hate to be polite and talk common-place. You aren&rsquo;t built
that way&mdash; and Tom wasn&rsquo;t either, in the old days. The
wife (or the mother and sisters) receives you kindly, for
Tom&rsquo;s sake, and makes much of you; but they don&rsquo;t know
you yet. You want to get Tom outside, and have a yarn and a drink
and a laugh with him&mdash;you are bursting to tell him all about
yourself, and get him to tell you all about himself, and ask him if
he remembers things; and you wonder if he is bursting the same way,
and hope he is. The old lady and sisters (or the wife) bore you
pretty soon, and you wonder if they bore Tom; you almost fancy,
from his looks, that they do. You wonder whether Tom is coming out
to-night, whether he wants to get out, and if he wants to and wants
to get out by himself, whether he&rsquo;ll be able to manage it;
but you daren&rsquo;t broach the subject, it wouldn&rsquo;t be
polite. You&rsquo;ve got to be polite. Then you get worried by the
thought that Tom is bursting to get out with you and only wants an
excuse; is waiting, in fact, and hoping for you to ask him in an
off-hand sort of way to come out for a stroll. But you&rsquo;re not
quite sure; and besides, if you were, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the
courage. By-and-bye you get tired of it all, thirsty, and want to
get out in the open air. You get tired of saying, &ldquo;Do you
really, Mrs. Smith?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do you think so, Miss
Smith?&rdquo; or &ldquo;You were quite right, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Well, I think so too, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; or, to the
brother, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I thought, Mr. Smith.&rdquo;
You don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;talk pretty&rdquo; to them, and
listen to their wishy-washy nonsense; you want to get out and have
a roaring spree with Tom, as you had in the old days; you want to
make another night of it with your old mate, Tom Smith; and pretty
soon you get the blues badly, and feel nearly smothered in there,
and you&rsquo;ve got to get out and have a beer anyway&mdash;Tom or
no Tom; and you begin to feel wild with Tom himself; and at last
you make a bold dash for it and chance Tom. You get up, look at
your hat, and say: &ldquo;Ah, well, I must be going, Tom;
I&rsquo;ve got to meet someone down the street at seven
o&rsquo;clock. Where&rsquo;ll I meet you in town next
week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dash it; you ain&rsquo;t going yet. Stay to tea, Joe,
stay to tea. It&rsquo;ll be on the table in a minute. Sit
down&mdash;sit down, man! Here, gimme your hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Tom&rsquo;s sister, or wife, or mother comes in with an
apron on and her hands all over flour, and says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not going yet, Mr. Brown? Tea&rsquo;ll
be ready in a minute. Do stay for tea.&rdquo; And if you make
excuses, she cross-examines you about the time you&rsquo;ve got to
keep that appointment down the street, and tells you that their
clock is twenty minutes fast, and that you have got plenty of time,
and so you have to give in. But you are mightily encouraged by a
winksome expression which you see, or fancy you see, on your side
of Tom&rsquo;s face; also by the fact of his having accidentally
knocked his foot against your shins. So you stay.</p>

<p>One of the females tells you to &ldquo;Sit there, Mr.
Brown,&rdquo; and you take your place at the table, and the polite
business goes on. You&rsquo;ve got to hold your knife and fork
properly, and mind your p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s, and when she says,
&ldquo;Do you take milk and sugar, Mr. Brown?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve
got to say, &ldquo;Yes, please, Miss
Smith&mdash;thanks&mdash;that&rsquo;s plenty.&rdquo; And when they
press you, as they will, to have more, you&rsquo;ve got to keep on
saying, &ldquo;No, thanks, Mrs. Smith; no, thanks, Miss Smith; I
really couldn&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ve done very well, thank you; I had
a very late dinner, and so on&rdquo;&mdash;bother such tommy-rot.
And you don&rsquo;t seem to have any appetite, anyway. And you
think of the days out on the track when you and Tom sat on your
swags under a mulga at mid-day, and ate mutton and johnny-cake with
clasp-knives, and drank by turns out of the old, battered, leaky
billy.</p>

<p>And after tea you have to sit still while the precious minutes
are wasted, and listen and sympathize, while all the time you are
on the fidget to get out with Tom, and go down to a private bar
where you know some girls.</p>

<p>And perhaps by-and-bye the old lady gets confidential, and
seizes an opportunity to tell you what a good steady young fellow
Tom is now that he never touches drink, and belongs to a temperance
society (or the Y.M.C.A.), and never stays out of nights.</p>

<p>Consequently you feel worse than ever, and lonelier, and sorrier
that you wasted your time coming. You are encouraged again by a
glimpse of Tom putting on a clean collar and fixing himself up a
bit; but when you are ready to go, and ask him if he&rsquo;s coming
a bit down the street with you, he says he thinks he will in such a
disinterested, don&rsquo;t-mind-if-I-do sort of tone, that he makes
you mad.</p>

<p>At last, after promising to &ldquo;drop in again, Mr. Brown,
whenever you&rsquo;re passing,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
forget to call,&rdquo; and thanking them for their assurance that
they&rsquo;ll &ldquo;be always glad to see you,&rdquo; and telling
them that you&rsquo;ve spent a very pleasant evening and enjoyed
yourself, and are awfully sorry you couldn&rsquo;t stay&mdash;you
get away with Tom.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t say much to each other till you get round the
corner and down the street a bit, and then for a while your
conversation is mostly common-place, such as, &ldquo;Well, how have
you been getting on all this time, Tom?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, all
right. How have you been getting on?&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>But presently, and perhaps just as you have made up your mind to
chance the alleged temperance business and ask Tom in to have a
drink, he throws a glance up and down the street, nudges your
shoulder, says &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; and disappears sideways into
a pub.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, Tom?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
yours, Joe?&rdquo; &ldquo;The same for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
here&rsquo;s luck, old man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck.&rdquo;
You take a drink, and look over your glass at Tom. Then the old
smile spreads over his face, and it makes you glad&mdash;you could
swear to Tom&rsquo;s grin in a hundred years. Then something
tickles him&mdash;your expression, perhaps, or a recollection of
the past&mdash;and he sets down his glass on the bar and laughs.
Then you laugh. Oh, there&rsquo;s no smile like the smile that old
mates favour each other with over the tops of their glasses when
they meet again after years. It is eloquent, because of the
memories that give it birth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another. Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;? Do
you remember&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Oh, it all comes back again like
a flash. Tom hasn&rsquo;t changed a bit; just the same
good-hearted, jolly idiot he always was. Old times back again!
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like old times,&rdquo; says Tom, after three
or four more drinks.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And so you make a night of it and get uproariously jolly. You
get as &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; as Bobby Burns did in the part of Tam
O&rsquo;Shanter, and have a better &ldquo;time&rdquo; than any of
the times you had in the old days. And you see Tom as nearly home
in the morning as you dare, and he reckons he&rsquo;ll get it hot
from his people&mdash;which no doubt he will&mdash; and he explains
that they are very particular up at home &mdash;church people, you
know&mdash;and, of course, especially if he&rsquo;s married,
it&rsquo;s understood between you that you&rsquo;d better not call
for him up at home after this&mdash;at least, not till things have
cooled down a bit. It&rsquo;s always the way. The friend of the
husband always gets the blame in cases like this. But Tom fixes up
a yarn to tell them, and you aren&rsquo;t to &ldquo;say anything
different&rdquo; in case you run against any of them. And he fixes
up an appointment with you for next Saturday night, and he&rsquo;ll
get there if he gets divorced for it. But he <i>might</i> have to
take the wife out shopping, or one of the girls somewhere; and if
you see her with him you&rsquo;ve got to lay low, and be careful,
and wait &mdash;at another hour and place, perhaps, all of which is
arranged&mdash; for if she sees you she&rsquo;ll smell a rat at
once, and he won&rsquo;t be able to get off at all.</p>

<p>And so, as far as you and Tom are concerned, the &ldquo;old
times&rdquo; have come back once more.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>But, of course (and we almost forgot it), you might chance to
fall in love with one of Tom&rsquo;s sisters, in which case there
would be another and a totally different story to tell.</p>

<h3 align="center"><b>II<br>
Jack Ellis</b>
</h3>

<p>Things are going well with you. You have escaped from &ldquo;the
track&rdquo;, so to speak, and are in a snug, comfortable little
billet in the city. Well, while doing the block you run against an
old mate of other days&mdash;<i>very</i> other days&mdash;call him
Jack Ellis. Things have gone hard with Jack. He knows you at once,
but makes no advance towards a greeting; he acts as though he
thinks you might cut him&mdash;which, of course, if you are a true
mate, you have not the slightest intention of doing. His coat is
yellow and frayed, his hat is battered and green, his trousers
&ldquo;gone&rdquo; in various places, his linen very cloudy, and
his boots burst and innocent of polish. You try not to notice these
things &mdash;or rather, not to seem to notice them&mdash;but you
cannot help doing so, and you are afraid he&rsquo;ll notice that
you see these things, and put a wrong construction on it. How men
will misunderstand each other! You greet him with more than the
necessary enthusiasm. In your anxiety to set him at his ease and
make him believe that nothing&mdash;not even money&mdash;can make a
difference in your friendship, you over-act the business; and
presently you are afraid that he&rsquo;ll notice that too, and put
a wrong construction on it. You wish that your collar was not so
clean, nor your clothes so new. Had you known you would meet him,
you would have put on some old clothes for the occasion.</p>

<p>You are both embarrassed, but it is <i>you</i> who feel
ashamed&mdash; you are almost afraid to look at him lest
he&rsquo;ll think you are looking at his shabbiness. You ask him in
to have a drink, but he doesn&rsquo;t respond so heartily as you
wish, as he did in the old days; he doesn&rsquo;t like drinking
with anybody when he isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, as he calls
it&mdash; when he can&rsquo;t shout.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter in the old days who held the money so
long as there was plenty of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in the camp. You
think of the days when Jack stuck to you through thick and thin.
You would like to give him money now, but he is so proud; he always
was; he makes you mad with his beastly pride. There wasn&rsquo;t
any pride of that sort on the track or in the camp in those days;
but times have changed&mdash;your lives have drifted too widely
apart&mdash; you have taken different tracks since then; and Jack,
without intending to, makes you feel that it is so.</p>

<p>You have a drink, but it isn&rsquo;t a success; it falls flat,
as far as Jack is concerned; he won&rsquo;t have another; he
doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;feel on&rdquo;, and presently he escapes under
plea of an engagement, and promises to see you again.</p>

<p>And you wish that the time was come when no one could have more
or less to spend than another.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I met an old mate of that description once, and so
successfully persuaded him out of his beastly pride that he
borrowed two pounds off me till Monday. I never got it back since,
and I want it badly at the present time. In future I&rsquo;ll leave
old mates with their pride unimpaired.</p>

<i>You</i> don&rsquo;t seem to care. Y&rsquo;orter to do

<p>Stowsher slouched at a greater angle to the greasy door-post,
and scowled under his hat-brim. It was a little, low, frowsy room
opening into Jones&rsquo; Alley. She sat at the table,
sewing&mdash;a thin, sallow girl with weak, colourless eyes. She
looked as frowsy as her surroundings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you go to some of them women, and
get fixed up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flicked the end of the table-cloth over some tiny,
unfinished articles of clothing, and bent to her work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know very well I haven&rsquo;t got a shilling,
Ernie,&rdquo; she said, quietly. &ldquo;Where am I to get the money
from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who asked yer to get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent, with the exasperating silence of a woman who has
determined to do a thing in spite of all reasons and arguments that
may be brought against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wot more do yer want?&rdquo; demanded Stowsher,
impatiently.</p>

<p>She bent lower. &ldquo;Couldn't we keep it, Ernie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot next?&rdquo; asked Stowsher, sulkily&mdash;he had
half suspected what was coming. Then, with an impatient oath,
&ldquo;You must be gettin&rsquo; ratty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She brushed the corner of the cloth further over the little
clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t cost anything, Ernie. I&rsquo;d take a
pride in him, and keep him clean, and dress him like a little lord.
He&rsquo;ll be different from all the other youngsters. He
wouldn&rsquo;t be like those dirty, sickly little brats out there.
He&rsquo;d be just like you, Ernie; I know he would. I&rsquo;ll
look after him night and day, and bring him up well and strong.
We&rsquo;d train his little muscles from the first, Ernie, and
he&rsquo;d be able to knock &rsquo;em all out when he grew up. It
wouldn&rsquo;t cost much, and I&rsquo;d work hard and be careful if
you&rsquo;d help me. And you&rsquo;d be proud of him, too,
Ernie&mdash;I know you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stowsher scraped the doorstep with his foot; but whether he was
&ldquo;touched&rdquo;, or feared hysterics and was wisely silent,
was not apparent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the first day I met you, Ernie?&rdquo;
she asked, presently.</p>

<p>Stowsher regarded her with an uneasy scowl:
&ldquo;Well&mdash;wot o&rsquo; that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came into the bar-parlour at the
&lsquo;Cricketers&rsquo; Arms&rsquo; and caught a push of &rsquo;em
chyacking your old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I altered that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you did. You done for three of them, one after
another, and two was bigger than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! and when the push come up we done for the
rest,&rdquo; said Stowsher, softening at the recollection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the day you come home and caught the landlord
bullying your old mother like a dog&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I got three months for that job. But it was worth
it!&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the
old woman might have had the knocker to keep away from the lush
while I was in quod. . . . But wot&rsquo;s all this got to do with
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> might barrack and fight for you, some day,
Ernie,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re old and out
of form and ain&rsquo;t got no push to back you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thing was becoming decidedly embarrassing to Stowsher; not
that he felt any delicacy on the subject, but because he hated to
be drawn into a conversation that might be considered
&ldquo;soft&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stow that!&rdquo; he said, comfortingly. &ldquo;Git
on yer hat, and I&rsquo;ll take yer for a trot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose quickly, but restrained herself, recollecting that it
was not good policy to betray eagerness in response to an
invitation from Ernie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;you know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to go out
like this. You can&rsquo;t&mdash; you wouldn&rsquo;t like to take
me out the way I am, Ernie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? Wot rot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fellows would see me,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And . . . wot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They might notice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wot o&rsquo; that? I want &rsquo;em to. Are yer
comin&rsquo; or are yer ain&rsquo;t? Fling round now. I can&rsquo;t
hang on here all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked towards Flagstaff Hill.</p>

<p>One or two, slouching round a pub. corner, saluted with
&ldquo;Wotcher, Stowsher!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not too stinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Stowsher.
&ldquo;Soak yer heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stowsher&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to stick,&rdquo; said one
privately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so he orter,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Wish I
had the chanst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two turned up a steep lane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t walk so fast up hill, Ernie; I can&rsquo;t,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Liz. I forgot that. Why didn&rsquo;t yer say
so before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was contentedly silent most of the way, warned by instinct,
after the manner of women when they have gained their point by
words.</p>

<p>Once he glanced over his shoulder with a short laugh.
&ldquo;Gorblime!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I nearly thought the little
beggar was a-follerin&rsquo; along behind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he left her at the door he said: &ldquo;Look here, Liz.
&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s half a quid. Git what yer want. Let her go.
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to graft again in the mornin&rsquo;, and
I&rsquo;ll come round and see yer to-morrer night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still she seemed troubled and uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ernie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well. Wot now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; it's a girl, Ernie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stowsher flung himself round impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, stow that! Yer always
singin&rsquo; out before yer hurt. . . . There&rsquo;s
somethin&rsquo; else, ain&rsquo;t there&mdash;while the
bloomin&rsquo; shop&rsquo;s open?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ernie. Ain&rsquo;t you going to kiss me? . . .
I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Satisfied! Yer don&rsquo;t want the kid to be arst
&rsquo;oo &rsquo;is father was, do yer? Yer&rsquo;d better come
along with me some day this week and git spliced. Yer don&rsquo;t
want to go frettin&rsquo; or any of that funny business while
it&rsquo;s on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ernie! do you really mean it?&rdquo;&mdash;and she
threw her arms round his neck, and broke down at last.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;So-long, Liz. No more funny business now&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
had enough of it. Keep yer pecker up, old girl. To-morrer night,
mind.&rdquo; Then he added suddenly: &ldquo;Yer might have known I
ain&rsquo;t that sort of a bloke&rdquo; &mdash;and left
abruptly.</p>

<p>Liz was very happy.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrSmellingscheck" id=
"MrSmellingscheck"></a>Mr. Smellingscheck</b>
</h2>

<p>I met him in a sixpenny restaurant&mdash;&ldquo;All meals,
6d.&mdash;Good beds, 1s.&rdquo; That was before sixpenny
restaurants rose to a third-class position, and became possibly
respectable places to live in, through the establishment, beneath
them, of fourpenny hash-houses (good beds, 6d.), and, beneath
<i>them</i> again, of <i>three</i>-penny
&ldquo;dining-rooms&mdash;<i>clean</i> beds, 4d.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were five beds in our apartment, the head of one against
the foot of the next, and so on round the room, with a space where
the door and washstand were. I chose the bed the head of which was
near the foot of his, because he looked like a man who took his
bath regularly. I should like, in the interests of sentiment, to
describe the place as a miserable, filthy, evil-smelling garret;
but I can&rsquo;t&mdash;because it wasn&rsquo;t. The room was large
and airy; the floor was scrubbed and the windows cleaned at least
once a week, and the beds kept fresh and neat, which is
more&mdash;a good deal more&mdash; than can be said of many genteel
private boarding-houses. The lodgers were mostly respectable
unemployed, and one or two&mdash;fortunate men!&mdash; in work; it
was the casual boozer, the professional loafer, and the occasional
spieler&mdash;the one-shilling-bed-men&mdash; who made the place
objectionable, not the hard-working people who paid ten pounds a
week for the house; and, but for the one-night lodgers and the big
gilt black-and-red bordered and &ldquo;shaded&rdquo;
&ldquo;6d.&rdquo; in the window &mdash;which made me glance
guiltily up and down the street, like a burglar about to do a job,
before I went in&mdash;I was pretty comfortable there.</p>

<p>They called him &ldquo;Mr. Smellingscheck&rdquo;, and treated
him with a peculiar kind of deference, the reason for which they
themselves were doubtless unable to explain or even understand. The
haggard woman who made the beds called him &ldquo;Mr.
Smell-&rsquo;is-check&rdquo;. Poor fellow! I didn&rsquo;t think, by
the look of him, that he&rsquo;d smelt his cheque, or anyone
else&rsquo;s, or that anyone else had smelt his, for many a long
day. He was a fat man, slow and placid. He looked like a typical
monopolist who had unaccountably got into a suit of clothes
belonging to a Domain unemployed, and hadn&rsquo;t noticed, or had
entirely forgotten, the circumstance in his business cares&mdash;if
such a word as care could be connected with such a calm,
self-contained nature. He wore a suit of cheap slops of some kind
of shoddy &ldquo;tweed&rdquo;. The coat was too small and the
trousers too short, and they were drawn up to meet the
waistcoat&mdash;which they did with painful difficulty, now and
then showing, by way of protest, two pairs of brass buttons and the
ends of the brace-straps; and they seemed to blame the irresponsive
waistcoat or the wearer for it all. Yet he never gave way to assist
them. A pair of burst elastic-sides were in full evidence, and a
rim of cloudy sock, with a hole in it, showed at every step.</p>

<p>But he put on his clothes and wore them like&mdash;like a
gentleman. He had two white shirts, and they were both dirty.
He&rsquo;d lay them out on the bed, turn them over, regard them
thoughtfully, choose that which appeared to his calm understanding
to be the cleaner, and put it on, and wear it until it was
unmistakably dirtier than the other; then he&rsquo;d wear the other
till it was dirtier than the first. He managed his three collars
the same way. His handkerchiefs were washed in the bathroom, and
dried, without the slightest disguise, in the bedroom. He never
hurried in anything. The way he cleaned his teeth, shaved, and made
his toilet almost transformed the place, in my imagination, into a
gentleman&rsquo;s dressing-room.</p>

<p>He talked politics and such things in the abstract&mdash;always
in the abstract &mdash;calmly in the abstract. He was an
old-fashioned Conservative of the Sir Leicester Deadlock style.
When he was moved by an extra shower of aggressive democratic
cant&mdash;which was seldom&mdash; he defended Capital, but only as
if it needed no defence, and as if its opponents were merely
thoughtless, ignorant children whom he condescended to set right
because of their inexperience and for their own good. He stuck
calmly to his own order&mdash;the order which had dropped him like
a foul thing when the bottom dropped out of his boom, whatever that
was. He never talked of his misfortunes.</p>

<p>He took his meals at the little greasy table in the dark corner
downstairs, just as if he were dining at the Exchange. He had a
chop&mdash;rather well-done&mdash;and a sheet of the <i>Herald</i>
for breakfast. He carried two handkerchiefs; he used one for a
handkerchief and the other for a table-napkin, and sometimes folded
it absently and laid it on the table. He rose slowly, putting his
chair back, took down his battered old green hat, and regarded it
thoughtfully&mdash;as though it had just occurred to him in a calm,
casual way that he&rsquo;d drop into his hatter&rsquo;s, if he had
time, on his way down town, and get it blocked, or else send the
messenger round with it during business hours. He&rsquo;d draw his
stick out from behind the next chair, plant it, and, if you
hadn&rsquo;t quite finished your side of the conversation, stand
politely waiting until you were done. Then he&rsquo;d look for a
suitable reply into his hat, put it on, give it a twitch to settle
it on his head&mdash;as gentlemen do a
&ldquo;chimney-pot&rdquo;&mdash;step out into the gangway, turn his
face to the door, and walk slowly out on to the middle of the
pavement&mdash; looking more placidly well-to-do than ever. The
saying is that clothes make a man, but <i>he</i> made his almost
respectable just by wearing them. Then he&rsquo;d consult his
watch&mdash;(he stuck to the watch all through, and it seemed a
good one&mdash;I often wondered why he didn&rsquo;t pawn it); then
he&rsquo;d turn slowly, right turn, and look down the street. Then
slowly back, left-about turn, and take a cool survey in that
direction, as if calmly undecided whether to take a cab and drive
to the Exchange, or (as it was a very fine morning, and he had half
an hour to spare) walk there and drop in at his club on the way.
He&rsquo;d conclude to walk. I never saw him go anywhere in
particular, but he walked and stood as if he could.</p>

<p>Coming quietly into the room one day, I surprised him sitting at
the table with his arms lying on it and his face resting on them. I
heard something like a sob. He rose hastily, and gathered up some
papers which were on the table; then he turned round, rubbing his
forehead and eyes with his forefinger and thumb, and told me that
he suffered from&mdash;something, I forget the name of it, but it
was a well-to-do ailment. His manner seemed a bit jolted and
hurried for a minute or so, and then he was himself again. He told
me he was leaving for Melbourne next day. He left while I was out,
and left an envelope downstairs for me. There was nothing in it
except a pound note.</p>

<p>I saw him in Brisbane afterwards, well-dressed, getting out of a
cab at the entrance of one of the leading hotels. But his manner
was no more self-contained and well-to-do than it had been in the
old sixpenny days&mdash;because it couldn&rsquo;t be. We had a
well-to-do whisky together, and he talked of things in the
abstract. He seemed just as if he&rsquo;d met me in the
Australia.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ARoughShed" id=
"ARoughShed"></a>&ldquo;A Rough Shed&rdquo;</b>
</h2>

<p>A hot, breathless, blinding sunrise&mdash;the sun having
appeared suddenly above the ragged edge of the barren scrub like a
great disc of molten steel. No hint of a morning breeze before it,
no sign on earth or sky to show that it is morning&mdash;save the
position of the sun.</p>

<p>A clearing in the scrub&mdash;bare as though the surface of the
earth were ploughed and harrowed, and dusty as the road. Two oblong
huts &mdash;one for the shearers and one for the rouseabouts&mdash;
in about the centre of the clearing (as if even the mongrel scrub
had shrunk away from them) built end-to-end, of weatherboards, and
roofed with galvanised iron. Little ventilation; no verandah; no
attempt to create, artificially, a breath of air through the
buildings. Unpainted, sordid&mdash;hideous. Outside, heaps of ashes
still hot and smoking. Close at hand, &ldquo;butcher&rsquo;s
shop&rdquo;&mdash;a bush and bag breakwind in the dust, under a
couple of sheets of iron, with offal, grease and clotted blood
blackening the surface of the ground about it. Greasy, stinking
sheepskins hanging everywhere with blood-blotched sides out. Grease
inches deep in great black patches about the fireplace ends of the
huts, where wash-up and &ldquo;boiling&rdquo; water is thrown.</p>

<p>Inside, a rough table on supports driven into the black, greasy
ground floor, and formed of flooring boards, running on uneven
lines the length of the hut from within about 6ft. of the
fire-place. Lengths of single six-inch boards or slabs on each
side, supported by the projecting ends of short pieces of timber
nailed across the legs of the table to serve as seats.</p>

<p>On each side of the hut runs a rough framework, like the
partitions in a stable; each compartment battened off to about the
size of a manger, and containing four bunks, one above the other,
on each side&mdash; their ends, of course, to the table. Scarcely
breathing space anywhere between. Fireplace, the full width of the
hut in one end, where all the cooking and baking for forty or fifty
men is done, and where flour, sugar, etc., are kept in open bags.
Fire, like a very furnace. Buckets of tea and coffee on roasting
beds of coals and ashes on the hearth. Pile of
&ldquo;brownie&rdquo; on the bare black boards at the end of the
table. Unspeakable aroma of forty or fifty men who have little
inclination and less opportunity to wash their skins, and who soak
some of the grease out of their clothes &mdash;in buckets of hot
water&mdash;on Saturday afternoons or Sundays. And clinging to all,
and over all, the smell of the dried, stale yolk of wool &mdash;the
stink of rams!</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a rouseabout of the rouseabouts. I have fallen so
far that it is beneath me to try to climb to the proud position of
&lsquo;ringer&rsquo; of the shed. I had that ambition once, when I
was the softest of green hands; but then I thought I could work out
my salvation and go home. I&rsquo;ve got used to hell since then. I
only get twenty-five shillings a week (less station store charges)
and tucker here. I have been seven years west of the Darling and
never shore a sheep. Why don&rsquo;t I learn to shear, and so make
money? What should I do with more money? Get out of this and go
home? I would never go home unless I had enough money to keep me
for the rest of my life, and I&rsquo;ll never make that Out Back.
Otherwise, what should I do at home? And how should I account for
the seven years, if I were to go home? Could I describe shed life
to them and explain how I lived. They think shearing only takes a
few days of the year&mdash;at the beginning of summer. They&rsquo;d
want to know how I lived the rest of the year. Could I explain that
I &lsquo;jabbed trotters&rsquo; and was a &lsquo;tea-and-sugar
burglar&rsquo; between sheds. They&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d been a
tramp and a beggar all the time. Could I explain <i>anything</i> so
that they&rsquo;d understand? I&rsquo;d have to be lying all the
time and would soon be tripped up and found out. For, whatever else
I have been I was never much of a liar. No, I&rsquo;ll never go
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I become momentarily conscious about daylight. The flies
on the track got me into that habit, I think; they start at
day-break&mdash; when the mosquitoes give over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cook rings a bullock bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cook is fire-proof. He is as a fiend from the
nethermost sheol and needs to be. No man sees him sleep, for he
makes bread &mdash;or worse, brownie&mdash;at night, and he rings a
bullock bell loudly at half-past five in the morning to rouse us
from our animal torpors. Others, the sheep-ho&rsquo;s or the
engine-drivers at the shed or wool-wash, call him, if he does
sleep. They manage it in shifts, somehow, and sleep somewhere,
sometime. We haven&rsquo;t time to know. The cook rings the bullock
bell and yells the time. It was the same time five minutes
ago&mdash;or a year ago. No time to decide which. I dash water over
my head and face and slap handfuls on my eyelids &mdash;gummed over
aching eyes&mdash;still blighted by the yolk o&rsquo; wool&mdash;
grey, greasy-feeling water from a cut-down kerosene tin which I
sneaked from the cook and hid under my bunk and had the foresight
to refill from the cask last night, under cover of warm, still,
suffocating darkness. Or was it the night before last? Anyhow, it
will be sneaked from me to-day, and from the crawler who will
collar it to-morrow, and &lsquo;touched&rsquo; and
&lsquo;lifted&rsquo; and &lsquo;collared&rsquo; and recovered by
the cook, and sneaked back again, and cause foul language, and
fights, maybe, till we &lsquo;cut-out&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we didn&rsquo;t have sweet dreams of home and mother,
gentle poet&mdash; nor yet of babbling brooks and sweethearts, and
love&rsquo;s young dream. We are too dirty and dog-tired when we
tumble down, and have too little time to sleep it off. We
don&rsquo;t want to dream those dreams out here&mdash; they&rsquo;d
only be nightmares for us, and we&rsquo;d wake to remember. We
<i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> remember here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the edge of the timber a great galvanised-iron shed,
nearly all roof, coming down to within 6ft. 6in. of the
&lsquo;board&rsquo; over the &lsquo;shoots&rsquo;. Cloud of red
dust in the dead timber behind, going up&mdash;noon-day dust. Fence
covered with skins; carcases being burned; blue smoke going
straight up as in noonday. Great glossy (greasy-glossy) black crows
&lsquo;flopping&rsquo; around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first syren has gone. We hurry in single files from
opposite ends of rouseabouts&rsquo; and shearers&rsquo; huts (as
the paths happen to run to the shed) gulping hot tea or coffee from
a pint-pot in one hand and biting at a junk of brownie in the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shed of forty hands. Shearers rush the pens and yank out
sheep and throw them like demons; grip them with their knees, take
up machines, jerk the strings; and with a rattling whirring roar
the great machine-shed starts for the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go it, you &mdash;&mdash; tigers!&rsquo; yells a
tar-boy. &lsquo;Wool away!&rsquo; &lsquo;Tar!&rsquo; &lsquo;Sheep
Ho!&rsquo; We rush through with a whirring roar till breakfast
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We seize our tin plate from the pile, knife and fork from
the candle-box, and crowd round the camp-oven to jab out lean
chops, dry as chips, boiled in fat. Chops or curry-and-rice. There
is some growling and cursing. We slip into our places without
removing our hats. There&rsquo;s no time to hunt for mislaid hats
when the whistle goes. Row of hat brims, level, drawn over eyes, or
thrust back&mdash;according to characters or temperaments. Thrust
back denotes a lucky absence of brains, I fancy. Row of forks going
up, or jabbing, or poised, loaded, waiting for last mouthful to be
bolted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We pick up, sweep, tar, sew wounds, catch sheep that
break from the pens, jump down and pick up those that can&rsquo;t
rise at the bottom of the shoots,
&lsquo;bring-my-combs-from-the-grinder-will-yer,&rsquo; laugh at
dirty jokes, and swear&mdash;and, in short, are the
&lsquo;will-yer&rsquo; slaves, body and soul, of seven, six, five,
or four shearers, according to the distance from the rolling
tables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shearer on the board at the shed is a demon. He gets
so much a hundred; we, 25s. a week. He is not supposed, by the
rules of the shed, the Union, and humanity, to take a sheep out of
the pen <i>after</i> the bell goes (smoke-ho, meals, or knock-off),
but his watch is hanging on the post, and he times himself to get
so many sheep out of the pen <i>before</i> the bell goes, and
<i>one more</i>&mdash;the &lsquo;bell-sheep&rsquo;&mdash;as it is
ringing. We have to take the last fleece to the table and leave our
board clean. We go through the day of eight hours in runs of about
an hour and 20 minutes between smoke-ho&rsquo;s&mdash;from 6 to 6.
If the shearers shore 200 instead of 100, they&rsquo;d get 2 Pounds
a day instead of 1 Pound, and we&rsquo;d have twice as much work to
do for our 25s. per week. But the shearers are racing each other
for tallies. And it&rsquo;s no use kicking. There is no God here
and no Unionism (though we all have tickets). But what am I
growling about? I&rsquo;ve worked from 6 to 6 with no
smoke-ho&rsquo;s for half the wages, and food we wouldn&rsquo;t
give the sheep-ho dog. It&rsquo;s the bush growl, born of heat,
flies, and dust. I&rsquo;d growl now if I had a thousand a year. We
<i>must</i> growl, swear, and some of us drink to d.t.&rsquo;s, or
go mad sober.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pants and shirts stiff with grease as though a couple of
pounds of soft black putty were spread on with a painter&rsquo;s
knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, gentle bard!&mdash;we don&rsquo;t sing at our work.
Over the whirr and roar and hum all day long, and with iteration
that is childish and irritating to the intelligent greenhand, float
unthinkable adjectives and adverbs, addressed to jumbucks,
jackaroos, and mates indiscriminately. And worse words for the boss
over the board&mdash;behind his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came of a Good Christian Family&mdash;perhaps
that&rsquo;s why I went to the Devil. When I came out here
I&rsquo;d shrink from the man who used foul language. In a short
time I used it with the worst. I couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it. If I went back to a
woman&rsquo;s country again I wouldn&rsquo;t swear. I&rsquo;d
forget this as I would a nightmare. That&rsquo;s the way of it.
There&rsquo;s something of the larrikin about us. We don&rsquo;t
exist individually. Off the board, away from the shed (and each
other) we are quiet&mdash;even gentle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great-horned ram, in poor condition, but shorn of a
heavy fleece, picks himself up at the foot of the
&lsquo;shoot&rsquo;, and hesitates, as if ashamed to go down to the
other end where the ewes are. The most ridiculous object under
Heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tar-boy of fifteen, of the bush, with a mouth so vile
that a street-boy, same age (up with a shearing uncle), kicks him
behind&mdash;having proved his superiority with his fists before
the shed started. Of which unspeakable little fiend the roughest
shearer of a rough shed was heard to say, in effect, that if he
thought there was the slightest possibility of his becoming the
father of such a boy he&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;take drastic measures
to prevent the possibility of his becoming a proud parent at
all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twice a day the cooks and their familiars carry buckets
of oatmeal-water and tea to the shed, two each on a yoke. We cry,
&lsquo;Where are you coming to, my pretty maids?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In ten minutes the surfaces of the buckets are black with
flies. We have given over trying to keep them clear. We stir the
living cream aside with the bottoms of the pints, and guzzle
gallons, and sweat it out again. Occasionally a shearer pauses and
throws the perspiration from his forehead in a rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shearers live in such a greedy rush of excitement that
often a strong man will, at a prick of the shears, fall in a
death-like faint on the board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hate the Boss-of-the-Board as the shearers&rsquo;
&lsquo;slushy&rsquo; hates the shearers&rsquo; cook. I don&rsquo;t
know why. He&rsquo;s a very fair boss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He refused to put on a traveller yesterday, and the
traveller knocked him down. He walked into the shed this morning
with his hat back and thumbs in waistcoat&mdash;a tribute to
man&rsquo;s weakness. He threatened to dismiss the
traveller&rsquo;s mate, a bigger man, for rough shearing&mdash;a
tribute to man&rsquo;s strength. The shearer said nothing. We hate
the boss because he <i>is</i> boss, but we respect him because he
is a strong man. He is as hard up as any of us, I hear, and has a
sick wife and a large, small family in Melbourne. God judge us
all!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a gambling-school here, headed by the
shearers&rsquo; cook. After tea they head-&rsquo;em, and advance
cheques are passed from hand to hand, and thrown in the dust until
they are black. When it&rsquo;s too dark to see with nose to the
ground, they go inside and gamble with cards. Sometimes they start
on Saturday afternoon, heading &rsquo;em till dark, play cards all
night, start again heading &rsquo;em Sunday afternoon, play cards
all Sunday night, and sleep themselves sane on Monday, or go to
work ghastly&mdash;like dead men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cry of &lsquo;Fight&rsquo;; we all rush out. But there
isn&rsquo;t much fighting. Afraid of murdering each other.
I&rsquo;m beginning to think that most bush crime is due to
irritation born of dust, heat, and flies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The smothering atmosphere shudders when the sun goes
down. We call it the sunset breeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saturday night or Sunday we&rsquo;re invited into the
shearers&rsquo; hut. There are songs that are not hymns and
recitations and speeches that are not prayers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last Sunday night: Slush lamps at long intervals on
table. Men playing cards, sewing on patches&mdash;(nearly all
smoking)&mdash; some writing, and the rest reading Deadwood Dick.
At one end of the table a Christian Endeavourer endeavouring; at
the other a cockney Jew, from the hawker&rsquo;s boat, trying to
sell rotten clothes. In response to complaints, direct and not
chosen generally for Sunday, the shearers&rsquo; rep. requests both
apostles to shut up or leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t be expected to take the Christian and
leave the Jew, any more than he could take the Jew and leave the
Christian. We are just amongst ourselves in our hell.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PayableGold" id=

</h2>

<p>Among the crowds who left the Victorian side for New South Wales
about the time Gulgong broke out was an old Ballarat digger named
Peter McKenzie. He had married and retired from the mining some
years previously and had made a home for himself and family at the
village of St. Kilda, near Melbourne; but, as was often the case
with old diggers, the gold fever never left him, and when the
fields of New South Wales began to blaze he mortgaged his little
property in order to raise funds for another campaign, leaving
sufficient behind him to keep his wife and family in comfort for a
year or so.</p>

<p>As he often remarked, his position was now very different from
what it had been in the old days when he first arrived from
Scotland, in the height of the excitement following on the great
discovery. He was a young man then with only himself to look out
for, but now that he was getting old and had a family to provide
for he had staked too much on this venture to lose. His position
did certainly look like a forlorn hope, but he never seemed to
think so.</p>

<p>Peter must have been very lonely and low-spirited at times. A
young or unmarried man can form new ties, and even make new
sweethearts if necessary, but Peter&rsquo;s heart was with his wife
and little ones at home, and they were mortgaged, as it were, to
Dame Fortune. Peter had to lift this mortgage off.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was always cheerful, even at the worst of times,
and his straight grey beard and scrubby brown hair encircled a
smile which appeared to be a fixture. He had to make an effort in
order to look grave, such as some men do when they want to force a
smile.</p>

<p>It was rumoured that Peter had made a vow never to return home
until he could take sufficient wealth to make his all-important
family comfortable, or, at least, to raise the mortgage from the
property, for the sacrifice of which to his mad gold fever he never
forgave himself. But this was one of the few things which Peter
kept to himself.</p>

<p>The fact that he had a wife and children at St. Kilda was well
known to all the diggers. They had to know it, and if they did not
know the age, complexion, history and peculiarities of every child
and of the &ldquo;old woman&rdquo; it was not Peter&rsquo;s
fault.</p>

<p>He would cross over to our place and talk to the mother for
hours about his wife and children. And nothing pleased him better
than to discover peculiarities in us children wherein we resembled
his own. It pleased us also for mercenary reasons.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same with my old woman,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same with my youngsters,&rdquo; Peter
would exclaim boisterously, for he looked upon any little
similarity between the two families as a remarkable coincidence. He
liked us all, and was always very kind to us, often standing
between our backs and the rod that spoils the child&mdash;that is,
I mean, if it isn&rsquo;t used. I was very short-tempered, but this
failing was more than condoned by the fact that Peter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;eldest&rdquo; was given that way also. Mother&rsquo;s second
son was very good-natured; so was Peter&rsquo;s third. Her
&ldquo;third&rdquo; had a great aversion for any duty that
threatened to increase his muscles; so had Peter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;second&rdquo;. Our baby was very fat and heavy and was given
to sucking her own thumb vigorously, and, according to the latest
bulletins from home, it was just the same with Peter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;last&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think we knew more about Peter&rsquo;s family than we did
about our own. Although we had never seen them, we were as familiar
with their features as the photographer&rsquo;s art could make us,
and always knew their domestic history up to the date of the last
mail.</p>

<p>We became interested in the McKenzie family. Instead of getting
bored by them as some people were, we were always as much pleased
when Peter got a letter from home as he was himself, and if a mail
were missed, which seldom happened&mdash;we almost shared his
disappointment and anxiety. Should one of the youngsters be ill, we
would be quite uneasy, on Peter&rsquo;s account, until the arrival
of a later bulletin removed his anxiety, and ours.</p>

<p>It must have been the glorious power of a big true heart that
gained for Peter the goodwill and sympathy of all who knew him.</p>

<p>Peter&rsquo;s smile had a peculiar fascination for us children.
We would stand by his pointing forge when he&rsquo;d be sharpening
picks in the early morning, and watch his face for five minutes at
a time, wondering sometimes whether he was always <i>smiling
inside</i>, or whether the smile went on externally irrespective of
any variation in Peter&rsquo;s condition of mind.</p>

<p>I think it was the latter case, for often when he had received
bad news from home we have heard his voice quaver with anxiety,
while the old smile played on his round, brown features just the
same.</p>

<p>Little Nelse (one of those queer old-man children who seem to
come into the world by mistake, and who seldom stay long) used to
say that Peter &ldquo;cried inside&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Once, on Gulgong, when he attended the funeral of an old
Ballarat mate, a stranger who had been watching his face curiously
remarked that McKenzie seemed as pleased as though the dead digger
had bequeathed him a fortune. But the stranger had soon reason to
alter his opinion, for when another old mate began in a tremulous
voice to repeat the words &ldquo;Ashes to ashes, an&rsquo; dust to
dust,&rdquo; two big tears suddenly burst from Peter&rsquo;s eyes,
and hurried down to get entrapped in his beard.</p>

<p>Peter&rsquo;s goldmining ventures were not successful. He sank
three duffers in succession on Gulgong, and the fourth shaft, after
paying expenses, left a little over a hundred to each party, and
Peter had to send the bulk of his share home. He lived in a tent
(or in a hut when he could get one) after the manner of diggers,
and he &ldquo;did for himself&rdquo;, even to washing his own
clothes. He never drank nor &ldquo;played&rdquo;, and he took
little enjoyment of any kind, yet there was not a digger on the
field who would dream of calling old Peter McKenzie &ldquo;a mean
man&rdquo;. He lived, as we know from our own observations, in a
most frugal manner. He always tried to hide this, and took care to
have plenty of good things for us when he invited us to his hut;
but children&rsquo;s eyes are sharp. Some said that Peter
half-starved himself, but I don&rsquo;t think his family ever knew,
unless he told them so afterwards.</p>

<p>Ah, well! the years go over. Peter was now three years from
home, and he and Fortune were enemies still. Letters came by the
mail, full of little home troubles and prayers for Peter&rsquo;s
return, and letters went back by the mail, always hopeful, always
cheerful. Peter never gave up. When everything else failed he would
work by the day (a sad thing for a digger), and he was even known
to do a job of fencing until such time as he could get a few pounds
and a small party together to sink another shaft.</p>

<p>Talk about the heroic struggles of early explorers in a hostile
country; but for dogged determination and courage in the face of
poverty, illness, and distance, commend me to the old-time
digger&mdash;the truest soldier Hope ever had!</p>

<p>In the fourth year of his struggle Peter met with a terrible
disappointment. His party put down a shaft called the Forlorn Hope
near Happy Valley, and after a few weeks&rsquo; fruitless driving
his mates jibbed on it. Peter had his own opinion about the
ground&mdash;an old digger&rsquo;s opinion, and he used every
argument in his power to induce his mates to put a few days&rsquo;
more work in the claim. In vain he pointed out that the quality of
the wash and the dip of the bottom exactly resembled that of the
&ldquo;Brown Snake&rdquo;, a rich Victorian claim. In vain he
argued that in the case of the abovementioned claim, not a colour
could be got until the payable gold was actually reached. Home Rule
and The Canadian and that cluster of fields were going ahead, and
his party were eager to shift. They remained obstinate, and at
last, half-convinced against his opinion, Peter left with them to
sink the &ldquo;Iawatha&rdquo;, in Log Paddock, which turned out a
rank duffer&mdash; not even paying its own expenses.</p>

<p>A party of Italians entered the old claim and, after driving it
a few feet further, made their fortune.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We all noticed the change in Peter McKenzie when he came to
&ldquo;Log Paddock&rdquo;, whither we had shifted before him. The
old smile still flickered, but he had learned to &ldquo;look&rdquo;
grave for an hour at a time without much effort. He was never quite
the same after the affair of Forlorn Hope, and I often think how he
must have &ldquo;cried&rdquo; sometimes &ldquo;inside&rdquo;.</p>

<p>However, he still read us letters from home, and came and smoked
in the evening by our kitchen-fire. He showed us some new portraits
of his family which he had received by a late mail, but something
gave me the impression that the portraits made him uneasy. He had
them in his possession for nearly a week before showing them to us,
and to the best of our knowledge he never showed them to anybody
else. Perhaps they reminded him of the flight of time&mdash;perhaps
he would have preferred his children to remain just as he left them
until he returned.</p>

<p>But stay! there was one portrait that seemed to give Peter
infinite pleasure. It was the picture of a chubby infant of about
three years or more. It was a fine-looking child taken in a sitting
position on a cushion, and arrayed in a very short shirt. On its
fat, soft, white face, which was only a few inches above the ten
very podgy toes, was a smile something like Peter&rsquo;s. Peter
was never tired of looking at and showing the picture of his
child&mdash;the child he had never seen. Perhaps he cherished a
wild dream of making his fortune and returning home before
<i>that</i> child grew up.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>McKenzie and party were sinking a shaft at the upper end of Log
Paddock, generally called &ldquo;The other end&rdquo;. We were at
the lower end.</p>

<p>One day Peter came down from &ldquo;the other end&rdquo; and
told us that his party expected to &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; during the
following week, and if they got no encouragement from the wash they
intended to go prospecting at the &ldquo;Happy Thought&rdquo;, near
Specimen Flat.</p>

<p>The shaft in Log Paddock was christened &ldquo;Nil
Desperandum&rdquo;. Towards the end of the week we heard that the
wash in the &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; was showing good colours.</p>

<p>Later came the news that &ldquo;McKenzie and party&rdquo; had
bottomed on payable gold, and the red flag floated over the shaft.
Long before the first load of dirt reached the puddling machine on
the creek, the news was all round the diggings. The &ldquo;Nil
Desperandum&rdquo; was a &ldquo;Golden Hole&rdquo;!</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>We will not forget the day when Peter went home. He hurried down
in the morning to have an hour or so with us before Cobb and Co.
went by. He told us all about his little cottage by the bay at St.
Kilda. He had never spoken of it before, probably because of the
mortgage. He told us how it faced the bay&mdash;how many rooms it
had, how much flower garden, and how on a clear day he could see
from the window all the ships that came up to the Yarra, and how
with a good telescope he could even distinguish the faces of the
passengers on the big ocean liners.</p>

<p>And then, when the mother&rsquo;s back was turned, he hustled us
children round the corner, and surreptitiously slipped a sovereign
into each of our dirty hands, making great pantomimic show for
silence, for the mother was very independent.</p>

<p>And when we saw the last of Peter&rsquo;s face setting like a
good-humoured sun on the top of Cobb and Co.&rsquo;s, a great
feeling of discontent and loneliness came over all our hearts.
Little Nelse, who had been Peter&rsquo;s favourite, went round
behind the pig-stye, where none might disturb him, and sat down on
the projecting end of a trough to &ldquo;have a cry&rdquo;, in his
usual methodical manner. But old &ldquo;Alligator
Desolation&rdquo;, the dog, had suspicions of what was up, and,
hearing the sobs, went round to offer whatever consolation
appertained to a damp and dirty nose and a pair of ludicrously
doleful yellow eyes.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnOversightofSteelmans" id=
"AnOversightofSteelmans"></a>An Oversight of Steelman&rsquo;s</b>
</h2>

<p>Steelman and Smith&mdash;professional wanderers&mdash;were
making back for Wellington, down through the wide and rather
dreary-looking Hutt Valley. They were broke. They carried their few
remaining belongings in two skimpy, amateurish-looking swags.
Steelman had fourpence left. They were very tired and very
thirsty&mdash;at least Steelman was, and he answered for both. It
was Smith&rsquo;s policy to feel and think just exactly as Steelman
did. Said Steelman:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The landlord of the next pub. is not a bad sort. I
won&rsquo;t go in&mdash; he might remember me. You&rsquo;d best go
in. You&rsquo;ve been tramping round in the Wairarapa district for
the last six months, looking for work. You&rsquo;re going back to
Wellington now, to try and get on the new corporation works just
being started there&mdash;the sewage works. You think you&rsquo;ve
got a show. You&rsquo;ve got some mates in Wellington, and
they&rsquo;re looking out for a chance for you. You did get a job
last week on a sawmill at Silverstream, and the boss sacked you
after three days and wouldn&rsquo;t pay you a penny. That&rsquo;s
just his way. I know him&mdash; at least a mate of mine does.
I&rsquo;ve heard of him often enough. His name&rsquo;s Cowman.
Don&rsquo;t forget the name, whatever you do. The landlord here
hates him like poison; he&rsquo;ll sympathize with you. Tell him
you&rsquo;ve got a mate with you; he&rsquo;s gone ahead&mdash;took
a short cut across the paddocks. Tell him you&rsquo;ve got only
fourpence left, and see if he&rsquo;ll give you a drop in a bottle.
Says you: &lsquo;Well, boss, the fact is we&rsquo;ve only got
fourpence, but you might let us have a drop in a bottle&rsquo;; and
very likely he&rsquo;ll stand you a couple of pints in a
gin-bottle. You can fling the coppers on the counter, but the
chances are he won&rsquo;t take them. He&rsquo;s not a bad sort.
Beer&rsquo;s fourpence a pint out here, same&rsquo;s in Wellington.
See that gin-bottle lying there by the stump; get it and
we&rsquo;ll take it down to the river with us and rinse it
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They reached the river bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take my swag&mdash;it looks more
decent,&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you what
we&rsquo;ll do: we&rsquo;ll undo both swags and make them into
one&mdash;one decent swag, and I&rsquo;ll cut round through the
lanes and wait for you on the road ahead of the pub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rolled up the swag with much care and deliberation and
considerable judgment. He fastened Smith&rsquo;s belt round one end
of it, and the handkerchiefs round the other, and made a towel
serve as a shoulder-strap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we had a canvas bag to put it in,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;or a cover of some sort. But never mind. The
landlord&rsquo;s an old Australian bushman, now I come to think of
it; the swag looks Australian enough, and it might appeal to his
feelings, you know&mdash;bring up old recollections. But
you&rsquo;d best not say you come from Australia, because
he&rsquo;s been there, and he&rsquo;d soon trip you up. He might
have been where you&rsquo;ve been, you know, so don&rsquo;t try to
do too much. You always do mug-up the business when you try to do
more than I tell you. You might tell him your mate came from
Australia&mdash;but no, he might want you to bring me in. Better
stick to Maoriland. I don&rsquo;t believe in too much
ornamentation. Plain lies are the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the landlord&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked
Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that. You don&rsquo;t want to know that. You
are not supposed to know him at all. It might look suspicious if
you called him by his name, and lead to awkward questions; then
you&rsquo;d be sure to put your foot into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could say I read it over the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bosh. Travellers don&rsquo;t read the names over the
doors, when they go into pubs. You&rsquo;re an entire stranger to
him. Call him &lsquo;Boss&rsquo;. Say &lsquo;Good-day, Boss,&rsquo;
when you go in, and swing down your swag as if you&rsquo;re used to
it. Ease it down like this. Then straighten yourself up, stick your
hat back, and wipe your forehead, and try to look as hearty and
independent and cheerful as you possibly can. Curse the Government,
and say the country&rsquo;s done. It don&rsquo;t matter what
Government it is, for he&rsquo;s always against it. I never knew a
real Australian that wasn&rsquo;t. Say that you&rsquo;re thinking
about trying to get over to Australia, and then listen to him
talking about it&mdash; and try to look interested, too! Get that
damned stone-deaf expression off your face! . . . He&rsquo;ll run
Australia down most likely (I never knew an Other-sider that had
settled down over here who didn&rsquo;t). But don&rsquo;t you make
any mistake and agree with him, because, although successful
Australians over here like to run their own country down,
there&rsquo;s very few of them that care to hear anybody else do
it. . . . Don&rsquo;t come away as soon as you get your beer. Stay
and listen to him for a while, as if you&rsquo;re interested in his
yarning, and give him time to put you on to a job, or offer you
one. Give him a chance to ask how you and your mate are off for
tobacco or tucker. Like as not he&rsquo;ll sling you half a crown
when you come away&mdash;that is, if you work it all right. Now try
to think of something to say to him, and make yourself a bit
interesting&mdash;if you possibly can. Tell him about the fight we
saw back at the pub. the other day. He might know some of the
chaps. This is a sleepy hole, and there ain&rsquo;t much news
knocking round. . . . I wish I could go in myself, but he&rsquo;s
sure to remember <i>me</i>. I&rsquo;m afraid he got left the last
time I stayed there (so did one or two others); and, besides, I
came away without saying good-bye to him, and he might feel a bit
sore about it. That&rsquo;s the worst of travelling on the old
road. Come on now, wake up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet I&rsquo;ll get a quart,&rdquo; said Smith,
brightening up, &ldquo;and some tucker for it to wash
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Steelman,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stoush you. Never mind the bottle; fling it away.
It doesn&rsquo;t look well for a traveller to go into a pub. with
an empty bottle in his hand. A real swagman never does. It looks
much better to come out with a couple of full ones. That&rsquo;s
what you&rsquo;ve got to do. Now, come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steelman turned off into a lane, cut across the paddocks to the
road again, and waited for Smith. He hadn&rsquo;t long to wait.</p>

<p>Smith went on towards the public-house, rehearsing his part as
he walked&mdash; repeating his &ldquo;lines&rdquo; to himself, so
as to be sure of remembering all that Steelman had told him to say
to the landlord, and adding, with what he considered appropriate
gestures, some fancy touches of his own, which he determined to
throw in in spite of Steelman&rsquo;s advice and warning.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him (this)&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell him (that).
Well, look here, boss, I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re pretty right and
I quite agree with you as far as that&rsquo;s concerned,
but,&rdquo; &amp;c. And so, murmuring and mumbling to himself,
Smith reached the hotel. The day was late, and the bar was small,
and low, and dark. Smith walked in with all the assurance he could
muster, eased down his swag in a corner in what he no doubt
considered the true professional style, and, swinging round to the
bar, said in a loud voice which he intended to be cheerful,
independent, and hearty:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, boss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;boss&rdquo;. It was about the
hardest-faced old woman that Smith had ever seen. The pub. had
changed hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, missus,&rdquo; stammered poor
Smith.</p>

<p>It was a knock-down blow for Smith. He couldn&rsquo;t come to
time. He and Steelman had had a landlord in their minds all the
time, and laid their plans accordingly; the possibility of having a
she &mdash;and one like this&mdash;to deal with never entered into
their calculations. Smith had no time to reorganise, even if he had
had the brains to do so, without the assistance of his mate&rsquo;s
knowledge of human nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, missus,&rdquo; he
stammered.</p>

<p>Painful pause. She sized him up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, missus&mdash;I&mdash;the fact is&mdash;will you
give me a bottle of beer for fourpence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;&mdash;. The fact is, we&rsquo;ve only got
fourpence left, and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a mate outside, and you
might let us have a quart or so, in a bottle, for that. I
mean&mdash;anyway, you might let us have a pint. I&rsquo;m very
sorry to bother you, missus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she couldn&rsquo;t do it. No. Certainly not. Decidedly not!
All her drinks were sixpence. She had her license to pay, and the
rent, and a family to keep. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay out
there&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t worth her while. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay
the cost of carting the liquor out, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, missus,&rdquo; poor Smith blurted out at last, in
sheer desperation, &ldquo;give me what you can in a bottle for
this. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a mate outside.&rdquo; And he
put the four coppers on the bar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got a bottle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I give you one, will you bring it back? You
can&rsquo;t expect me to give you a bottle as well as a
drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum; I&rsquo;ll bring it back directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reached out a bottle from under the bar, and very
deliberately measured out a little over a pint and poured it into
the bottle, which she handed to Smith without a cork.</p>

<p>Smith went his way without rejoicing. It struck him forcibly
that he should have saved the money until they reached Petone, or
the city, where Steelman would be sure to get a decent drink. But
how was he to know? He had chanced it, and lost; Steelman might
have done the same. What troubled Smith most was the thought of
what Steelman would say; he already heard him, in imagination,
saying: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mug, Smith&mdash; Smith, you
<i>are</i> a mug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Steelman didn&rsquo;t say much. He was prepared for the
worst by seeing Smith come along so soon. He listened to his story
with an air of gentle sadness, even as a stern father might listen
to the voluntary confession of a wayward child; then he held the
bottle up to the fading light of departing day, looked through it
(the bottle), and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t worth while dividing
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smith&rsquo;s heart shot right down through a hole in the sole
of his left boot into the hard road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Smith,&rdquo; said Steelman, handing him the
bottle, &ldquo;drink it, old man; you want it. It wasn&rsquo;t
altogether your fault; it was an oversight of mine. I didn&rsquo;t
bargain for a woman of that kind, and, of course, <i>you</i>
couldn&rsquo;t be expected to think of it. Drink it! Drink it down,
Smith. I&rsquo;ll manage to work the oracle before this night is
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smith was forced to believe his ears, and, recovering from his
surprise, drank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised to take back the bottle,&rdquo; he said, with
the ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>Steelman took the bottle by the neck and broke it on the
fence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Smith; I&rsquo;ll carry the swag for a
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they tramped on in the gathering starlight.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="HowSteelmantoldhisStory" id=
"HowSteelmantoldhisStory"></a>How Steelman told his Story</b>
</h2>

<p>It was Steelman&rsquo;s humour, in some of his moods, to take
Smith into his confidence, as some old bushmen do their dogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nearly as good as an intelligent sheep-dog
to talk to, Smith&mdash; when a man gets tired of thinking to
himself and wants a relief. You&rsquo;re a bit of a mug and a good
deal of an idiot, and the chances are that you don&rsquo;t know
what I&rsquo;m driving at half the time&mdash; that&rsquo;s the
main reason why I don&rsquo;t mind talking to you. You ought to
consider yourself honoured; it ain&rsquo;t every man I take into my
confidence, even that far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smith rubbed his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner talk to you&mdash;or a stump&mdash;any
day than to one of those silent, suspicious, self-contained,
worldly-wise chaps that listen to everything you say&mdash;sense
and rubbish alike&mdash;as if you were trying to get them to take
shares in a mine. I drop the man who listens to me all the time and
doesn&rsquo;t seem to get bored. He isn&rsquo;t safe. He
isn&rsquo;t to be trusted. He mostly wants to grind his axe against
yours, and there&rsquo;s too little profit for me where there are
two axes to grind, and no stone&mdash;though I&rsquo;d manage it
once, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are several ways. Either you join forces, for
instance, and find a grindstone&mdash;or make one of the other
man&rsquo;s axe. But the last way is too slow, and, as I said,
takes too much brain-work&mdash; besides, it doesn&rsquo;t pay. It
might satisfy your vanity or pride, but I&rsquo;ve got none. I had
once, when I was younger, but it&mdash;well, it nearly killed me,
so I dropped it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can mostly trust the man who wants to talk more than
you do; he&rsquo;ll make a safe mate&mdash;or a good
grindstone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smith scratched the nape of his neck and sat blinking at the
fire, with the puzzled expression of a woman pondering over a
life-question or the trimming of a hat. Steelman took his chin in
his hand and watched Smith thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I say, Steely,&rdquo; exclaimed Smith, suddenly,
sitting up and scratching his head and blinking harder than
ever&mdash;&ldquo;wha&mdash;what am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I the axe or the grindstone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! your brain seems in extra good working order
to-night, Smith. Well, you turn the grindstone and I grind.&rdquo;
Smith settled. &ldquo;If you could grind better than I, I&rsquo;d
turn the stone and let <i>you</i> grind, I&rsquo;d never go against
the interests of the firm&mdash;that&rsquo;s fair enough,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; admitted Smith; &ldquo;I suppose
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I. Now, Smith, we&rsquo;ve got along all right
together for years, off and on, but you never know what might
happen. I might stop breathing, for instance&mdash;and so might
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smith began to look alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poetical justice might overtake one or both of
us&mdash;such things have happened before, though not often. Or,
say, misfortune or death might mistake us for honest, hard-working
mugs with big families to keep, and cut us off in the bloom of all
our wisdom. You might get into trouble, and, in that case,
I&rsquo;d be bound to leave you there, on principle; or I might get
into trouble, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have the brains to get me
out&mdash; though I know you&rsquo;d be mug enough to try. I might
make a rise and cut you, or you might be misled into showing some
spirit, and clear out after I&rsquo;d stoushed you for it. You
might get tired of me calling you a mug, and bossing you and making
a tool or convenience of you, you know. You might go in for honest
graft (you were always a bit weak-minded) and then I&rsquo;d have
to wash my hands of you (unless you agreed to keep me) for an
irreclaimable mug. Or it might suit me to become a respected and
worthy fellow townsman, and then, if you came within ten miles of
me or hinted that you ever knew me, I&rsquo;d have you up for
vagrancy, or soliciting alms, or attempting to levy blackmail.
I&rsquo;d have to fix you&mdash;so I give you fair warning. Or we
might get into some desperate fix (and it needn&rsquo;t be very
desperate, either) when I&rsquo;d be obliged to sacrifice you for
my own personal safety, comfort, and convenience. Hundreds of
things might happen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as I said, we&rsquo;ve been at large together for
some years, and I&rsquo;ve found you sober, trustworthy, and
honest; so, in case we do part &mdash;as we will sooner or
later&mdash;and you survive, I&rsquo;ll give you some advice from
my own experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place: If you ever happen to get born again
&mdash;and it wouldn&rsquo;t do you much harm&mdash;get born with
the strength of a bullock and the hide of one as well, and a
swelled head, and no brains&mdash; at least no more brains than
you&rsquo;ve got now. I was born with a skin like tissue-paper, and
brains; also a heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get born without relatives, if you can: if you
can&rsquo;t help it, clear out on your own just as soon after
you&rsquo;re born as you possibly can. I hung on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have relations, and feel inclined to help them any
time when you&rsquo;re flush (and there&rsquo;s no telling what a
weak-minded man like you might take it into his head to
do)&mdash;don&rsquo;t do it. They&rsquo;ll get a down on you if you
do. It only causes family troubles and bitterness. There&rsquo;s no
dislike like that of a dependant. You&rsquo;ll get neither
gratitude nor civility in the end, and be lucky if you escape with
a character. (You&rsquo;ve got <i>no</i> character, Smith;
I&rsquo;m only just supposing you have.) There&rsquo;s no hatred
too bitter for, and nothing too bad to be said of, the mug who
turns. The worst yarns about a man are generally started by his own
tribe, and the world believes them at once on that very account.
Well, the first thing to do in life is to escape from your
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ever go to work&mdash;and miracles have happened
before&mdash; no matter what your wages are, or how you are
treated, you can take it for granted that you&rsquo;re sweated; act
on that to the best of your ability, or you&rsquo;ll never rise in
the world. If you go to see a show on the nod you&rsquo;ll be found
a comfortable seat in a good place; but if you pay the chances are
the ticket clerk will tell you a lie, and you&rsquo;ll have to
hustle for standing room. The man that doesn&rsquo;t ante gets the
best of this world; anything he&rsquo;ll stand is good enough for
the man that pays. If you try to be too sharp you&rsquo;ll get into
gaol sooner or later; if you try to be too honest the chances are
that the bailiff will get into your house&mdash;if you have
one&mdash;and make a holy show of you before the neighbours. The
honest softy is more often mistaken for a swindler, and accused of
being one, than the out-and-out scamp; and the man that tells the
truth too much is set down as an irreclaimable liar. But most of
the time crow low and roost high, for it&rsquo;s a funny world, and
you never know what might happen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you get married (and there&rsquo;s no accounting
for a woman&rsquo;s taste) be as bad as you like, and then
moderately good, and your wife will love you. If you&rsquo;re bad
all the time she can&rsquo;t stand it for ever, and if you&rsquo;re
good all the time she&rsquo;ll naturally treat you with contempt.
Never explain what you&rsquo;re going to do, and don&rsquo;t
explain afterwards, if you can help it. If you find yourself
between two stools, strike hard for your own self,
Smith&mdash;strike hard, and you&rsquo;ll be respected more than if
you fought for all the world. Generosity isn&rsquo;t understood
nowadays, and what the people don&rsquo;t understand is either
&lsquo;mad&rsquo; or &lsquo;cronk&rsquo;. Failure has no case, and
you can&rsquo;t build one for it. . . . I started out in life very
young&mdash;and very soft.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to tell me your story,
Steely,&rdquo; remarked Smith.</p>

<p>Steelman smiled sadly.</p>
