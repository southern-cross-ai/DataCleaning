<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>I submit this volume to the public in the hope that it may increase
the amount of interest usually shown in Australian History by deepening
the general knowledge of the subject, and illustrating it by those
vivid details which arrest the attention and enable the student to
visualize past events.</p>

<p>The number of events described in a Source Book must necessarily be
smaller than that in histories of another type; but the aim is to place
the student in contact with the evidence of history in order that he
may become his own historian by drawing his own deductions from the
contemporary records. The greatest historian can find no materials
ulterior to such as are here presented, for there is nothing ulterior
to them but the deeds themselves. They are the records written by the
men who gave their life and health to lay the foundation of Australia's
greatness&mdash;by Phillip, weakening under the racking cares of the
infant state; by Sturt in the scorching desert, as the last duty of an
exhausting day. They are aglow with the heat of action; they are
inspiring in their quiet modesty and strength.</p>

<p>In order to give greater continuity to the volume, short
introductions have been placed at the head of each selection. It has
been impossible to quote in full all the documents of which use has
been made, but fuller information may be obtained by reference to the
"source" mentioned at the head of each selection. The editor or author
of the source and its date of publication are shown in order to
facilitate further research.</p>

<p>The Source Book has been compiled with attention to the requirements
of schools, and it is hoped that teachers in Australia will avail
themselves of the opportunity to introduce the study of history from
contemporary documents, and thus in this respect bring Australia into
line with the other countries where source books are already familiar.
The section on discovery and exploration may with advantage be used in
the study of geography.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to the proprietors of the "Times" for permission
to quote certain pages from "The Times History of the War in South
Africa," and "The Times History of the War and Encyclopaedia," and also
for the "Dispatch from a Special Correspondent at the Dardanelles,"
printed in the "Times," 7 May 1915.</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I acknowledge my indebtedness to
Professor Scott, of Melbourne University (at whose suggestion the work
was undertaken), for his interest and advice; and to Arthur Wadsworth,
Esq., Chief Librarian for the Parliament of the Commonwealth, for his
courteous assistance.</p>

<h2>DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION</h2>

<h2><a name="DISCOVERY_OF_TASMANIA" id=
"DISCOVERY_OF_TASMANIA"></a>DISCOVERY OF TASMANIA</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Tasman's Journal (edited by Heeres), pp. 1,
11-16</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Spaniard Torres was probably the first European to sight
Australia (Cape Yorke); but Tasman was the first who consciously
discovered the Great South Land. In his search for fresh fields for
trade, he came upon Tasmania and New Zealand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Journal or description drawn up by me, ABEL JAN TASMAN, of a Voyage
made from the town of Batavia in E. India for the discovery of the
unknown Southland, in the year of our Lord 1642, the 14th of August.
May God Almighty vouchsafe his Blessing on this work. AMEN.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;Days reckoned from midnight to midnight.
Longitude calculated from meridian of Peak of Teneriffe.</p>

<p><i>Item the 23rd Nov.</i>&mdash;Good weather with a south-easterly
wind and a steady breeze; in the morning, we found our rudder broken at
top in the tiller hole; we therefore hauled to windward under reduced
sail and fitted a cross beam to either side. By estimation the west
side of Nova Guinea must be North of us.</p>

<p><i>Item the 24th do.</i> Good weather and a clear sky. In the
afternoon about 4 o'clock we saw land bearing East by North of us; at
about 10 miles distance by estimation. The land we sighted was very
high. Towards evening we also saw S.S.E. of us three high mountains,
and to the N.E. two more mountains, but less high than those to
southward. This land being the first we have met with in the South sea
and not known to any European nation, we have conferred on it the name
of Anthoony Van Diemenslandt, in honor of the Hon. Governor-General,
our illustrious master, who sent us to make this discovery; the islands
circumjacent so far as known to us, we have named after the Hon.
Councillors of India.</p>

<p><i>Item 28th do.</i> In the evening we came under the shore. There
are under the shore some small islands one of which looks like a
lion.</p>

<p><i>Item 29th do.</i> In the morning were still near the rock which
looks like a lion's head. Towards noon passed two rocks; the most
westerly looks like Pedra Branca, which lies on the coast of China, the
most easterly, looking like a high rugged tower, lies about 16 miles
out from the mainland. Ran through between these rocks and the land. We
came before a way which seemed likely to afford a good anchorage upon
which we resolved to run into it. We again made for the shore, the wind
and current having driven us so far out to sea that we could barely see
the land.</p>

<p><i>Item 1st Dec.</i> We resolved that it would be best and most
expedient to touch at the land, the sooner the better; both to get
better acquainted with the land and secure refreshment for our own
behoof. About one hour after sunset we dropped anchorage in a good
harbour, for all of which it behooves us to thank God Almighty with
grateful hearts.</p>

<p><i>Item 2nd do.</i> Early in the morning we sent our own pilot Major
Francoys Jacobz in command of our pinnace manned with 4 musketeers and
6 rowers, all of them furnished with pikes and side arms together with
the cockboat of the <i>Zeehaen</i>, with one of her second mates and
six musketeers in it, to a bay situated N.W. of us at upwards of a
mile's distance in order to ascertain what facilities (as regards fresh
water, refreshments, timber and the like) may be available there. About
three hours before nightfall the boats came back, bringing various
samples of vegetables, which they had seen growing there in great
abundance, some of them in appearance not unlike a certain plant
growing at the Cabo de Bona Esperance, and fit to be used as pot-herbs;
and another species with long leaves and brackish taste strongly
resembling persil de mer or samphou. The pilot Major and second mate of
the <i>Zeehaen</i> made the following report, to wit:</p>

<p>That they had rowed the space of upwards of a mile round the said
point where they had found high but level land, covered with vegetation
and not cultivated but growing naturally (by the will of God) abundance
of excellent timber and a gently sloping watercourse in a barren
valley; the said water though of good quality being difficult to
procure, because the watercourse is so shallow that the water could be
dipped with bowls only.</p>

<p>That they had heard certain human sounds, and also sounds resembling
the music of a small trump or a small gong not far from them though
they had seen no one.</p>

<p>That they had seen two trees about 2 or 2-1/2 fathoms in thickness
measuring from 60-65 feet from the ground to the lowermost branches,
which trees bore notches made with flint implements, the bark having
been removed for the purpose; these notches forming a kind of steps to
enable persons to get up the trees and rob birds' nests in their tops
were fully five feet apart; so that our men concluded that the natives
here must be of very tall stature or must be in possession of some sort
of artifice for getting up the said trees. In one of the trees these
notched steps were so fresh and new that they seemed to have been cut
less than four days ago.</p>

<p>That on the ground they discovered the footprints of animals, not
unlike those of a tiger's claws. They also brought on board a small
quantity of gum, of a seemingly very fine quality, which had exuded
from trees, and bore some resemblance to gum-lac.</p>

<p>That at one extremity on the point of the way they had seen large
numbers of gulls, wild ducks, and geese, but had perceived none further
inward though they had heard their cries, and had found no fish except
different kinds of mussels forming small clusters in various
places.</p>

<p>That the land is pretty generally covered with trees, standing so
far apart that they allow a passage everywhere and a look-out to a
great distance, so that when landing, our men could always get sight of
natives or wild beasts unhindered by dense shrubbery or underwood,
which would prove a great advantage in exploring the country.</p>

<p>That in the interior they had in several places observed numerous
trees which had deep holes burnt into them at the upper end of the foot
while the earth had here and there been dug out with the fist so as to
form a fireplace; the surrounding soil having become as hard as flint
through the action of fire.</p>

<p>A short time before we got sight of our boats returning to the
ships, we now and then saw clouds of dense smoke rising up from the
land (it was nearly always north of us) and surmised this must be a
signal given by our men because they were so long coming back.</p>

<p>When our men came on board again, we inquired of them whether they
had been there and made a fire, to which they returned a negative
answer; adding, however, that at various times and points in the wood
they had also seen clouds of smoke ascending. So there can be no doubt
there must be men here of extraordinary stature.</p>

<p><i>Item 3rd Dec.</i> In the afternoon we went to the S.E. side of
this bay, in the boats, having with us pilot Major Francoys Jacobz,
Skipper Gerrit Janz, Isack Gilseman, supercargo on board the
<i>Zeehaen</i>, subcargo Abraham Cooman and our master carpenter Pieter
Jacobz; we carried with us a pole with the Company's mark carved into
it, and a Prince flag to be set up there that those who shall come
after us may become aware we have been here, and have taken possession
of the said land as our lawful property. When we had rowed about
half-way with our boats it began to blow very stiffly, and the sea ran
so high that the cockboat of the <i>Zeehaen</i> was compelled to pull
back to the ships, while we ran on with our pinnace.</p>

<p>When we had come close inshore in a small inlet the surf ran so high
that we could not get near the shore without running the risk of having
our pinnace dashed to pieces. We then ordered the carpenter aforesaid
to swim to the shore alone with the pole and the flag.</p>

<p>We made him plant the said pole with the flag at the top, into the
earth, about the centre of the bay near four tall trees easily
recognizable and standing in the form of a crescent, exactly before the
one standing lowest. This tree is burnt in just above ground and is in
reality taller than the other three, but it seems to be shorter because
it stands lower on the sloping ground. Our master carpenter, having in
the sight of myself Abel Janz Tasman, skipper Gerrit Janz and subcargo
Abraham Cooman performed the work entrusted to him, we pulled with our
pinnace as near the shore as we ventured to do; the carpenter aforesaid
thereupon swam back to the pinnace through the surf. This work having
been duly executed, we pulled back to the ships, leaving the
above-mentioned as a memorial for those who shall come after us, and
for the natives of this country who did not show themselves though we
suspect some of them were at no great distance and closely watching our
proceedings.</p>

<p><i>Item 4th Dec.</i> In the evening we saw a round mountain bearing
N.N.W. of us at about 8 miles' distance.</p>

<p><i>Item 5th do.</i> The high round mountain which we had seen the
day before bore now due W. of us at 6 miles' distance. At this point
the land fell off to the N.W. so that we could no longer steer near the
coast here, seeing that the wind was almost ahead. We therefore
convened the Council and the second mates, with whom after due
deliberation we resolved, and subsequently called out to the officer of
the <i>Zeehaen</i> that pursuant to the resolution of the 11th ultimo,
we should direct our course due east, and on the said course run to the
full longitude of 195&deg;, or the Salamonis Islands. Set our course
due east in order to make further discoveries.</p>

<p>[This course brought them to New Zealand.]</p>

<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION_OF_WESTERN_AUSTRALIA" id=
"DESCRIPTION_OF_WESTERN_AUSTRALIA"></a>DESCRIPTION OF WESTERN
AUSTRALIA</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;The Voyages and Adventures of Captain William
Dampier (published 1776). Vol. II, pp. 134-40</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dampier was an Englishman who had joined a company of American
buccaneers. They arrived in May 1698 on the Western coast of Australia,
which was by this time fairly well known to the Dutch under the name of
New Holland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New Holland is a very large tract of land. It is not yet determined
whether it is an island or a main continent; but I am certain that it
joins neither to Asia, Africa nor America. This part of it that we saw
is all low even land, with sandy banks against the sea, only the points
are rocky, and so are some of the islands in this bay.</p>

<p>The land is of a dry sandy soil, destitute of water, except you make
wells; yet producing divers sorts of trees, but the woods are not
thick, nor the trees very big. Most of the trees that we saw are
dragon-trees as we supposed, and these too are the largest trees of any
there.</p>

<p>They are about the bigness of our large apple-trees, and about the
same height, and the rind is blackish and somewhat rough. The leaves
are of a dark colour; the gum distils out of the knots or cracks that
are in the bodies of the trees. We compared it with some gum dragon, or
dragon's blood, that was on board, and it was of the same colour and
taste. The other sorts of trees were not known by any of us. There was
pretty long grass growing under the trees, but it was very thin. We saw
no trees that bore fruit or berries.</p>

<p>We saw no sort of animal, nor any track of beast, but once, and that
seemed to be the tread of a beast as big as a mastiff dog. Here are a
few small land-birds, but none bigger than a black-bird and but few sea
fowls.</p>

<p>Neither is the sea very plentifully stored with fish, unless you
reckon the manatee and turtle as such. Of these creatures there is
plenty, but they are extraordinary shy, though the inhabitants cannot
trouble them much, having neither boats nor iron.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this country are the miserablest people in the
world. The Hodmadods of Monomatapa, though a nasty people yet for
wealth are gentlemen to these, who have no houses and skin garments,
sheep, poultry, and fruits of the earth, ostrich eggs etc. as the
Hodmadods have; and setting aside their human shape, they differ but
little from brutes. They are tall, straight-bodied and thin, with small
long limbs. They have great heads, round foreheads and great brows.
Their eyelids are always half closed to keep the flies out of their
eyes, being so troublesome here, that no fanning will keep them from
coming to one's face, and without the assistance of both hands to keep
them off, will creep into one's nostrils and mouth too, if the lips are
not shut very close. So that from their infancy being thus annoyed with
these insects, they never open their eyes as other people; and
therefore they cannot see far, unless they hold up their heads, as if
they were looking at somewhat over them.</p>

<p>They have great bottle noses, pretty full lips, and wide mouths. The
two fore-teeth of their upper jaw are wanting in all of them, men and
women, old and young; whether they draw them out, I know not, neither
have they any beards. They are long-visaged, and of a very unpleasing
aspect, having no one graceful feature in their faces. Their hair is
black, short and curled, like that of the negroes, and not long and
lank like the common Indian. The colour of the skin, both of their
faces and the rest of their body, is coal black, like that of the
negroes of Guinea.</p>

<p>They have no sort of clothes, but a piece of the rind of a tree tied
like a girdle about their waists, and a handful of long grass or three
or four small green boughs, full of leaves, thrust under their girdle
to cover their nakedness.</p>

<p>They have no houses, but lie in the open air, without any covering,
the earth their bed, and the heaven their canopy. Their only food is a
small sort of fish, which they get by making wares of stone, across
little coves, or branches of the sea; every tide bringing in the small
fish, and there leaving them for a prey to these people, who constantly
attend there to search for them at low water. This small fry I take to
be the top of their fishery; they have no instruments to catch great
fish, should they come; and such seldom stay to be left behind at low
water; nor could we catch any fish with our hooks and lines all the
while we lay there.</p>

<p>In other places at low water they seek for cockles, mussels, and
periwinkles; of these shell-fish there are fewer still, so that their
chief dependence is on what the sea leaves in their wares, which, be it
much or little, they gather up, and march to the place of their abode.
There the old people, that are not able to stir abroad, by reason of
their age, and the tender infants, wait their return: and what
providence has bestowed upon them, they presently broil on the coals,
and eat in common. Sometimes they get as many fish as make them a
splendid banquet; and at other times they scarce get every one a taste;
but be it little or much that they get, every one has his part, as well
the young and tender, and the old and feeble who are not able to go
abroad, as the strong and lusty.</p>

<p>How they get their fire I know not; but probably, as Indians do out
of wood. I have seen the Indians of Bon-Airy do it, and have myself
tried the experiment. They take a flat piece of wood that is pretty
soft, and make a small dent in one side of it, then they take another
hard round stick, about the bigness of one's little finger, and
sharpening it at one end like a pencil, they put the sharp end in the
hole or dent of the soft flat piece, and then rubbing or twirling the
hard piece between the palms of their hands, they drill the soft piece
till it smokes, and at last takes fire.</p>

<p>These people speak somewhat through the throat, but we could not
understand one word that they said. We anchored, as I said before,
January 5th, and seeing men walking on the shore, we presently sent a
canoe to get some acquaintance with them, for we were in hopes to get
some provisions among them. But the inhabitants, seeing our boat
coming, ran away and hid themselves. We searched afterwards three days
in hopes to find the houses, but found none, yet we saw many places
where they had made fires. At last being out of hopes to find their
habitations, we searched no further but left a great many toys ashore,
in such places that we thought that they would come. In all our search
we found no water, but old wells on the sandy bays.</p>

<p>At last we went over to the islands, and there we found a great many
of the natives; I do believe there were forty on one island, men women
and children. The men at our first coming ashore, threatened us with
their lances and swords, but they were frightened, by firing one gun,
which we fired purposely to scare them. The island was so small that
they could not hide themselves; but they were much disordered at our
landing, especially the women and children, for we went directly to
their camp. The lustiest of the women, snatching up their infants, ran
away howling, and the little children ran after, squeaking and bawling,
but the men stood still. Some of the women and such of the people as
could not go from us, lay still by a fire making a doleful noise, as if
we had been coming to devour them; but when they saw we did not intend
to harm them, they were pretty quiet, and the rest that fled from us at
our first coming, returned again. This, their place of dwelling, was
only a fire, with a few boughs before it, set up on that side the wind
was of.</p>

<p>After we had been here a little while, the men began to be familiar,
and we cloathed some of them, designing to have some service of them
for it; for we found some wells of water here, and intended to carry
two or three barrels of it on board. But being somewhat troublesome to
carry on the canoes, we thought to have made these men carry it for us
and therefore we gave them some cloathes; to one an old pair of
breeches; to another a ragged shirt; to the third a jacket that was
scarce worth owning; which yet would have been very acceptable at some
places where we had been, and so we thought they might have with these
people. We put them on them, thinking that this finery would have
brought them to work heartily for us; and our water being filled in
small long barrels, about six gallons each, which were made purposely
to carry water in, we brought these, our new servants, to the wells and
put a barrel on each of their shoulders for them to carry to the canoe.
But all the signs we could make were to no purpose, for they stood like
statues, without motion, but grinned like so many monkeys, staring one
upon another, for these poor creatures seem not accustomed to carry
burdens; and I believe that one of our ships-boys of ten years old,
would carry as much as one of them; so we were forced to carry our
water ourselves, and they very fairly put the cloathes off again, and
laid them down as if cloathes were only to work in. I did not perceive
that they had any great liking to them at first, neither did they seem
to admire anything that we had.</p>

<p>At our first coming, before we were acquainted with them, or they
with us, a company of them who lived on the main, came just against our
ship, and standing on a pretty bank, threatened us with their swords
and lances, by shaking them at us; at last the captain ordered the drum
to be beaten, which was done of a sudden with much vigour, purposely to
scare the poor creatures. They, hearing the noise ran away as fast as
they could drive, and when they ran away in haste, they would cry,
gurry, gurry, speaking deep in the throat. Those inhabitants also that
live on the main, would always run away from us; yet we took several of
them. For, as I have already observed, they had such bad eyes, that
they could not see us till we came close to them. We always gave them
victuals, and let them go again but the islanders, after our first time
of being among them, did not stir for us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Captain Cook was the first Englishman to search for the Great South
Land. After observing the transit of Venus, he made extensive
explorations in New Zealand, and then sailed West, to seek the East
Coast of New Holland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>April 1770. Thursday 19th.</i> At 5, set the topsails close
reef'd and 6, saw land, extending from N.E. to W., distance 5 or 6
leagues, having 80 fathoms, fine sandy bottom. The Southernmost land we
had in sight, which bore from us W 3/4 S., I judged to lay in the
latitude of 38&deg; 0' S., and in the Long. of 211&deg; 7' W. from the
Meridian of Greenwich. I have named it Point Hicks, because Lieutenant
Hicks was the first who discovered this land. To the Southward of this
Point we could see no land, and yet it was clear in that quarter and by
our Long. compared with that of Tasman's, the body of Van Diemen's Land
ought to have bore due South from us. The Northernmost land in sight
bore N. by E. 1/2 E., and a small island lying close to a Point on the
main bore W., distant 2 Leagues. This Point I have named Cape Howe; it
may be known by the trending of the Coast, which is N. on the one side,
and S.W. on the other.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 28th.</i> At daylight in the morning we discovered a
Bay which appeared to be tolerably well sheltered from all winds, into
which I resolved to go with the ship, and with this view sent the
Master in the Pinnace to sound the entrance.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 29th.</i> Saw as we came in, on both points of the Bay,
several of the natives and a few huts; men, women, and children, on the
S. shore abreast of the ship, to which place I went in the boats in
hopes of speaking with them, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander,
and Tupia. As we approached the shore they all made off, except two
men, who seemed resolved to oppose our landing. As soon as I saw this I
ordered the boats to lay upon their oars, in order to speak to them;
but this was to little purpose, for neither us nor Tupia could
understand one word they said. We then threw them some nails, beads,
etc., ashore, which they took up, and seemed not ill-pleased with, in
so much that I thought that they beckoned us to come ashore, but in
this we were mistaken, for as soon as we put the boat in they again
came to oppose us, upon which I fired a musket between the two, which
had no other effect than to make them retire back, where bundles of
their darts lay, and one of them took up a stone and threw it at us,
which caused my firing a second musket, load with small shot; and
although some of the shot struck the man yet it had no other effect
than making him lay hold on a target. Immediately after this we landed,
which we had no sooner done than they throw'd two darts at us; this
obliged me to fire a third shot, soon after which, they both made off,
but not in such haste but what we might have taken one; but Mr. Banks
being of opinion that the darts were poisoned, made me cautious how I
advanced into the woods. We found here a few small huts made of the
bark of trees, in one of which were four or five small children with
whom we left some strings of beads, etc. A quantity of darts lay about
the huts; these we took away with us. Three canoes lay upon the beach,
the worst, I think, I ever saw; they were about 12 or 14 feet long,
made of one piece of the bark of a tree, drawn or tied up at each end,
and the middle kept open by means of stick by way of thwarts. After
searching for fresh water without success, except a little in a small
hole dug in the sand, we embarked and went over to the N. point of the
Bay, where in coming in we saw several people; but when we landed now
there was nobody to be seen. We found here some fresh water, which came
trinkling down and stood in pools among the rocks; but as this was
troublesome to come at I sent a party of men ashore in the morning to
the place where we first landed, to dig holes in the sand, by which
means and a small stream they found fresh water sufficient to water the
ship. The string of beads, etc., we had left with the children last
night were found lying in the huts this morning; probably the natives
were afraid to take them away.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 1st.</i> This morning a party of us went ashore to
some huts not far from the watering-place, where some of the natives
are daily seen; here we left several articles, such as cloth, looking
glasses, combs, beads, nails, etc.; after this we made an excursion
into the Country, which we found diversified with woods, lawns, and
marshes. The woods are free from underwood of every kind, and the trees
are at such a distance from one another, that the whole country, or at
least a great part of it, might be cultivated without having to cut
down a single tree. We found the soil everywhere, except in the
marshes, to be a light white sand, and produceth a quantity of good
grass, which grows in little tufts about as big as one can hold in
one's hands, and pretty close to one another; in this manner the
surface of the ground is coated. In the woods between the trees, Dr.
Solander had a bare sight of a small animal something like a rabbit,
and we found the dung of an animal which must feed upon grass, and
which, we judge, could not be less than a deer; we also saw the track
of a dog, or some such like animal. We met with some huts and places
where the natives had been, and at our first setting out one of them
was seen; the others had, I suppose, fled upon our approach. I saw some
trees that had been cut down by the natives with some sort of a blunt
instrument, and several trees that were barked, the bark of which had
been cut by the same instrument; in many of the trees, especially the
Palms, were cut steps of about 3 or 4 feet asunder for the conveniency
of climbing them. We found 2 sorts of gum, one sort of which is like
gum-dragon, and is the same, I suppose, Tasman took for gum-lac; it is
extracted from the largest tree in the woods.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 3rd.</i> After this we took water, and went almost to
the head of the Inlet, where we landed and travelled some distance
inland. We found the face of the country much the same as I have before
described, but the land much richer, for instead of sand, I found in
many places a deep black soil, which we thought was capable of
producing any kind of grain. At present it produceth besides timber, as
fine meadow as ever was seen; however, we found it not all like this,
some few places were very rocky, but this, I believe to be
uncommon.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 6th.</i> The great quantity of plants Mr. Banks and Dr.
Solander found in this place, occasioned my giving it the name of
Botany Bay. During our stay in this harbour I caused the English
colours to be displayed ashore every day, and an inscription to be cut
out upon one of the trees near the watering-place, setting forth the
ship's name, date, etc. Having seen everything the place afforded, we
at daylight in the morning, weighed with a light breeze at N.W. and put
to sea, and the wind soon after coming to the Southward, we steered
along shore N.N.E., and at noon were about 2 or 3 miles from the land,
and abreast of a bay, wherein there appeared to be a safe anchorage,
which I called Port Jackson. It lies 3 leagues to the Northward of
Botany Bay.</p>

<p align="center">CAPE YORK. POSSESSION ISLAND</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 22nd Aug.</i> Gentle breezes at E. by S. and clear
weather. We had not steered above 3 or 4 miles along shore to the
Westward before we discovered the land ahead to be Islands detached by
several Channels from the main land; upon this we brought to, to wait
for the Yawl, and called the other boats on board, and after giving
them proper instructions sent them away again to lead us through the
channel next the main, and as soon as the yawl was on board, made sail
after them with the ship. Before and after we anchored we saw a number
of people upon this Island, armed in the same manner as all the others
we have seen, except one man, who had a bow, and a bundle of arrows,
the first we have seen upon this coast. From the appearance of the
people we expected they would have opposed our landing; but as we
approached the shore they all made off, and left us in peaceable
possession of as much of the island as served our purpose. After
landing, I went upon the highest hill, which, however, was of no great
height, yet no less than twice or thrice the height of the ship's
mastheads; but I could see from it no land between S.W. and W.S.W. so I
did not doubt but there was a passage. I could see plainly that the
lands laying to the N.W. of this passage were composed of a number of
islands of various extent, both for height and circuit, ranged one
behind another as far to the Northward and Westward as I could see,
which could not be less than 12 or 14 leagues.</p>

<p>Having satisfied myself of the great probability of a passage thro'
which I intend going with the ship, and therefore may land no more upon
this Eastern Coast of New Holland, and on the Western side I can make
no new discovery, the honor of which belongs to the Dutch Navigators,
but the Eastern Coast from the Lat. of 38&deg; S. down to this place, I
am confident, was never seen or visited by any European before us; and
notwithstanding I had in the name of His Majesty taken possession of
several places upon this coast, I now once more hoisted English
colours, and in the name of His Majesty King George the Third, took
possession of the whole Eastern Coast from the above Lat. down to this
place by the name of New Wales, together with all the Bays, Harbours,
Rivers, and Islands, situated upon the said coast; after which we fired
three volleys of small arms, which were answered by the like number
from the ship.</p>

<p>This done, we set out for the ship, but were some time in getting on
board on account of a very rapid ebb tide, which set N.E. out of the
passage.</p>

<h2><a name="BASS_STRAIT" id="BASS_STRAIT"></a>BASS STRAIT</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Voyage to Terra Australis (Matthew Flinders,
1814), Introduction, pp. xcvi-xcvii, cxix-cxliii</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first coastal explorations after the establishment of Sydney
were conducted by Bass and Flinders. Together they discovered the
Hunter River; Bass in a second voyage discovered Western Port; and
again together they sailed through Bass Strait, proving Tasmania to be
an island.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1795. On arriving at Port Jackson, in September it appeared that the
investigation of the coast had not been greatly extended beyond the
three harbours; and even in these some of the rivers were not
altogether explored.</p>

<p>In Mr. George Bass, surgeon of the <i>Reliance</i>, I had the
happiness to find a man whose ardour for discovery was not to be
repressed by any obstacle, nor deterred by danger; and with this friend
a determination was formed of completing the examination of the East
Coast of New South Wales, by all such opportunities as the duty of the
ship and procurable means could admit.</p>

<p>Projects of this nature, when originating in the minds of young men,
are usually termed romantic; and so far from any good being
anticipated, even prudence and friendship join in discouraging, if not
in opposing them. Thus it was in the present case; so that a little
boat of eight feet long, called <i>Tom Thumb</i>, with a crew composed
of ourselves and a boy, was the best equipment to be procured for the
first outset. In the month following the arrival of the ships, we
proceeded round in this boat, to Botany Bay; and ascending George's
River, one of two which falls into the Bay, explored its winding course
about twenty miles beyond where Governor Hunter's survey had been
carried.</p>

<p>The sketch made of this river and presented to the Governor with the
favourable report of the land on its borders, induced His Excellency to
examine them himself shortly afterward; and was followed by
establishing there a new branch of the colony, under the name of Banks'
Town.</p>

<p>1796. We sailed out of Port Jackson early in the morning of March
25, and stood a little off to sea to be ready for the sea breeze.</p>

<p>The sea breeze, on the 27th, opposed our return; and learning from
two Indians that no water could be procured at Red Point, we accepted
their offer of piloting us to a river which, they said, lay a few miles
further southward, and where not only fresh water was abundant, but
also fish and wild ducks. These men were natives of Botany Bay, whence
it was that we understood a little of their language, whilst that of
some others was altogether unintelligible. Their river proved to be
nothing more than a small stream, which descended from a lagoon under
Hat Hill, and forced a passage for itself through the beach; so that we
entered it with difficulty even in <i>Tom Thumb</i>. Our two conductors
then quitted the boat to walk along the sandy shore abreast, with eight
or ten strange natives in company.</p>

<p>After rowing a mile up the stream, and finding it to become more
shallow, we began to entertain doubts of securing a retreat from these
people, should they be hostilely inclined; and they had the reputation
at Port Jackson of being exceedingly ferocious, if not cannibals. Our
muskets were not yet freed from rust and sand, and there was a pressing
necessity to procure fresh water before attempting to return northward.
Under these embarrassments we agreed upon a plan of action, and went on
shore directly to the natives. Mr. Bass employed some of them to assist
in repairing an oar which had been broken in our disaster, whilst I
spread the wet powder out in the sun. This met with no opposition, for
they knew not what the powder was; but when we proceeded to clean the
muskets, it excited so much alarm that it was necessary to desist.</p>

<p>On inquiring of the two friendly natives for water, they pointed
upwards to the lagoon; but after many evasions our barica was filled at
a hole not many yards distant.</p>

<p>The number of people had increased to near twenty, and others were
still coming, so that it was necessary to use all possible expedition
in getting out of their reach. But a new employment arose upon our
hands; we had clipped the hair and beards of the two Botany Bay natives
at Red Point; and they were showing themselves to the others, and
persuading them to follow their example. Whilst, therefore, the powder
was drying, I began with a large pair of scissors to execute my new
office upon the eldest of four or five chins presented to me; and as
great nicety was not required, the shearing of a dozen of them did not
occupy me long. Some of the more timid were alarmed at a formidable
instrument coming so near to their noses, and would scarcely be
persuaded by their shaven friends to allow the operation to be
finished. But when their chins were held up a second time, their fear
of the instrument&mdash;the wild stare of their eyes&mdash;and the
smile which they forced, formed a compound upon the rough savage
countenance, not unworthy the pencil of a Hogarth. I was almost tempted
to try what effect a little snip would produce; but our situation was
too critical to admit of such experiments.</p>

<p>Everything being prepared for a retreat, the natives became
vociferous for the boat to go up to the lagoon; and it was not without
stratagem that we succeeded in getting down to the entrance of the
stream, where the depth of water placed us out of their reach.</p>

<p>In 1798 Mr. Bass sailed (in a whaleboat) with only six weeks'
provisions; but with the assistance of occasional supplies of petrels,
fish, seal's flesh, and a few geese and black swans, and by abstinence
he had been enabled to prolong his voyage beyond <i>eleven</i> weeks.
His ardour and perseverance were crowned, in despite of the foul winds
which so much opposed him, with a degree of success not to have been
anticipated from such feeble means. In three hundred miles of coast
from Fort Jackson to the Ram Head he added a number of particulars
which had escaped Captain Cook; and will always escape any navigator in
a first discovery, unless he have the time and means of joining a close
examination by boats, to what may be seen from the ship.</p>

<p>Our previous knowledge of the coast scarcely extended beyond the Ram
Head; and there began the harvest in which Mr. Bass was ambitious to
place the first reaping-hook. The new coast was traced three hundred
miles; and instead of trending southwards to join itself to Van
Diemen's Land, as Captain Furneaux had supposed, he found it, beyond a
certain point, to take a direction nearly opposite, and to assume the
appearance of being exposed to the buffetings of an open sea. Mr. Bass,
himself, entertained no doubt of the existence of a wide strait,
separating Van Diemen's Land from New South Wales; and he yielded with
the greatest reluctance to the necessity of returning, before it was so
fully ascertained as to admit of no doubt in the minds of others. But
he had the satisfaction of placing at the end of his new coast, an
extensive and useful harbour, surrounded with a country superior to any
other known in the southern parts of New South Wales.</p>

<p>A voyage expressly undertaken for discovery in an open boat, and in
which six hundred miles of coast, mostly in a boisterous climate, was
explored, has not, perhaps, its equal in the annals of maritime
history. The public will award to its high-spirited and able conductor,
alas! now no more, an honorable place in the list of those whose ardour
stands most conspicuous for the promotion of useful knowledge.</p>

<p>1798. Mr. Bass had been returned a fortnight from his expedition in
the whaleboat; and he communicated all his notes and observations to be
added to my chart. There seemed to want no other proof of the existence
of a passage between New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, than that
of sailing positively through it; but however anxious I was to obtain
this proof, the gratification of my desire was required to be suspended
by a voyage to Norfolk Island in the <i>Reliance</i>.</p>

<p>In September following, His Excellency, Governor Hunter, had the
goodness to give me the <i>Norfolk</i>, a colonial sloop of twenty-five
tons with authority to penetrate behind Furneaux's Islands; and should
a strait be found, to pass through it, and return by the south end of
Van Diemen's Land. Twelve weeks were allowed for the performance of
this service, and provisions for that time were put on board; the rest
of the equipment was completed by the friendly care of Captain
Waterhouse of the <i>Reliance</i>.</p>

<p>I had the happiness to associate my friend Bass in this new
expedition, and to form an excellent crew of eight volunteers from the
King's ships.</p>

<p align="center">THE WEST END OF THE STRAIT</p>

<p>The south-west wind died away in the night; and at six next morning,
Dec. 9, we got under way with a light air at south-east. After rounding
the north-east point of the three-hummock land, our course westward was
pursued along its north side.</p>

<p>A large flock of gannets was observed at daylight, to issue out of
the Great Bight to the southward; and they were followed by such a
number of the sooty petrels as we had never seen equalled. There was a
stream of from fifty to eighty yards in depth, and of three hundred
yards or more in breadth; the birds were not scattered, but flying as
compactly as a free movement of their wings seemed to allow; and during
a full hour and a half, this stream of petrels continued to pass
without interruption, at a rate little inferior to the swiftness of the
pigeon. On the lowest computation, I think the number could not have
been less than a hundred millions; and we were thence led to believe
that there must be, in the large bight, one or more uninhabited islands
of considerable size.</p>

<p>From the north-east point of the three-hummock land, the shore
trended W. 1&deg; N. three miles; then S. 39&deg; W. four miles, to a
rocky point forming the south-west extremity of what was then
ascertained to be Three-hummock Island. The channel which separates it
from the land to the west is, at least, two miles in width, and is
deep; so that it was difficult to conjecture how the Indians were able
to get over to the island. It was almost certain that they had no
canoes at Port Dalrymple, nor any means of reaching islands lying not
more than two cable lengths from the shore; and it therefore seemed
improbable that they should possess canoes here. The small size of
Three-hummock Island rendered the idea of fixed inhabitants
inadmissible; and whichever way it was considered, the presence of men
there was a problem difficult to be resolved.</p>

<p>The coast on the west side of the channel lies nearly south, and
rises in height as it advances towards the cliffy head, set on the 6th
p.m. The north end of this island is a sloping rocky point; and the
first projection which opened round it, was at S. 32&acute; W., five or
six miles. Beyond this there was nothing like mainland to be seen;
indeed, this western land itself had very little the appearance of
being such, either in its form, or in its poor starved vegetation. So
soon as we had passed the north sloping point, a long swell was
perceived to come from the South-west, such as we had not been
accustomed to for some time. It broke heavily upon a small reef, lying
a mile and a half from the point, and upon all the western shores; but
although it was likely to prove troublesome, and perhaps dangerous, Mr.
Bass and myself hailed it with joy and mutual congratulation, as
announcing the completion of our long-wished-for discovery of a passage
into the Southern Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>We had a fine breeze at east; and our course was directed for a
small, rocky island, which lies W. 1/2 N. 6 miles from the north point
of the barren land. This land appeared to be almost white with birds;
and so much excited our curiosity and hope of procuring a supply of
food, that Mr. Bass went on shore in the boat whilst I stood off and
on, waiting his return. No land could be seen to the northward, and the
furthest clearly distinguishable in the opposite direction was a steep
island at the distance of four leagues.</p>

<p>Mr. Bass returned at half past two, with a boat-load of seals and
albatrosses. He had been obliged to fight his way up the cliffs of the
islands with the seals, and when arrived at the top, to make a road
with his clubs amongst the albatrosses. These birds were sitting upon
their nests, and almost covered the surface of the ground, nor did they
any otherwise derange themselves for the new visitors, than to peck at
their legs as they passed by. This species of albatross is white on the
neck and breast, partly brown on the back and wings, and its size is
less than many others met with in that sea, particularly in the high
southern latitudes. The seals were of the usual size, and bore a
reddish fur, much inferior in quality to that of the seals at
Furneaux's Islands.</p>

<p>Albatross Island, for so it was named, is near two miles in length,
and sufficiently high to be seen five or six leagues from a ship's
deck: its shores are mostly steep cliffs.</p>

<p>The north-west cape of Van Diemen's Land, or island as it might now
be termed, is a steep black head, which, from its appearance, I call
Cape Grim. It lies nearly due south, four miles from the centre of
Trefoil, in latitude 40&deg; 44&acute;; the longtitude will be 144&deg;
43&acute; East, according to the position of Albatross Island made in
the <i>Investigator</i>. There are two rocks close to Cape Grim, of the
same description with itself. On the north side of the Cape the shore
is a low sandy beach, and trends north-eastward three or four miles;
but whether there be sufficient depth for ships to pass between it and
Barren Island, has not, I believe, been yet ascertained. To the south
of the Cape the black cliffs extend seven or eight miles, when the
shore falls back eastward to a sandy bay of which little could be
perceived.</p>

<p>1799. To the strait which had been the great object of research, and
whose discovery was now completed, Governor Hunter gave, at my
recommendation, the name of Bass Strait. This was no more than a just
tribute to my worthy friend and companion, for the extreme dangers and
fatigues he had undergone in first entering it in the whale-boat, and
to the correct judgment he had formed from various indications, of the
existence of a wide opening between Van Diemen's Land and New South
Wales.</p>

Australis. He sailed along the South coast and up the East, to Port
Jackson: subsequently, he circumnavigated the continent and suggested
its present name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>October 16th</i>, 1801. At daybreak we expected to see the
highland of the Cape (of Good Hope), but the weather being hazy, it
could not be distinguished until eight o'clock.</p>

<p>At this time we had not a single person on the sick list, both
officers and men being fully in as good health as when we sailed from
Spithead. I had begun very early to put in execution the beneficial
plan first practised and made known by the great Captain Cook. It was
in the standing orders of the ship, that on every fine day the deck
below and the cockpits should be cleared, washed, aired with stoves,
and sprinkled with vinegar. On wet and dull days they were cleaned and
aired without washing. Care was taken to prevent the people from
sleeping upon deck, or lying down in their wet clothes; and once in
every fortnight or three weeks, as circumstances permitted, their beds,
and the contents of their lockers, chests, and bags, were exposed to
the sun and air. On the Thursday and Sunday mornings the ship's company
was mustered, and every man appeared clean shaved and dressed; and when
the evenings were fine, the drum and fife announced the forecastle to
be the scene of dancing; nor did I discourage other playful amusements
which might occasionally be more to the taste of the sailors, and were
not unseasonable.</p>

<p>Within the tropics, lime juice and sugar were made to suffice as
antiscorbutics; on reaching a higher latitude, sour krout and vinegar
were substituted; the essence of malt was reserved for the passage to
New Holland, and for future occasions. On consulting with the surgeon,
I had thought it expedient to make some slight changes in the issuing
of the provisions. Oatmeal was boiled for breakfast four days in the
week instead of three; and when rice was issued after the expenditure
of the cheese, it was boiled on the other three days. Pease soup was
prepared for dinner four days a week as usual; and at other times two
ounces of portable broth, in cakes, to each man, with such additions of
onions, pepper, etc., as the different messes possessed, made a
comfortable addition to their salt meat. And neither in this passage,
nor, I may add, in any subsequent part of the voyage, were the officers
or people restricted to any allowance of fresh water. They drank freely
at the scuttled cask, and took away, under the inspection of the
officer of the watch, all that was requisite for culinary purposes; and
very frequently two casks of water in the week were given for washing
their clothes. With these regulations, joined to a due enforcement of
discipline, I had the satisfaction to see my people orderly and full of
zeal for the service in which we were engaged; and in such a state of
health, that no delay at the Cape was required beyond the necessary
refitment of the ship, and I still hoped to save a good part of the
summer season upon the south coast of Terra Australis.</p>

<p align="center">KING GEORGE'S SOUND</p>

<p>On Dec. 30th our wooding and the watering of the ship were
completed, the rigging was refitted, the sails repaired and bent, and
the ship unmoored. Our friends, the natives, continued to visit us; and
the old man with several others being at the tents this morning, I
ordered a party of marines on shore to be exercised in their presence.
The red coats and white crossed belts were greatly admired, having some
resemblance to their own manner of ornamenting themselves; and the
drum, but particularly the fife, excited their astonishment, but when
they saw these beautiful red and white men with their bright muskets,
drawn up in a line, they absolutely screamed with delight; nor were
their wild gestures and vociferation to be silenced but by commencing
the exercise, to which they paid the most earnest and silent attention.
Several of them moved their hands involuntarily in accordance with the
motions; and the old man placed himself at the end of the rank, with a
short staff in his hand, which he shouldered, presented, grounded, as
did the marines their muskets, without, I believe, knowing what he did.
Before firing, the Indians were made acquainted with what was going to
take place; so that the volleys did not excite much terror.</p>

<p align="center">PORT PHILLIP</p>

<p><i>Monday, April 26th</i>, 1802. On coming within five miles of the
shore at eleven o'clock, we found it to be low and mostly sandy; and
that the bluff head, which had been taken for the north end of an
island, was part of a ridge of hills rising at Cape Schanck. We then
bore away westward, in order to trace the land round the head of the
deep bight.</p>

<p>On the west side of the rocky point there was a small opening with
breaking water across it; however, on advancing a little more westward
the opening assumed a more interesting aspect, and I bore away to have
a nearer view. A large extent of water presently became visible within
side; and although the entrance seemed to be very narrow, and there
were in it strong ripplings like breakers, I was induced to steer in at
half-past one; the ship being close upon the wind, and every man ready
for tacking at a moment's warning; the soundings were irregular between
6 and 12 fathoms, until we got four miles within the entrance, when
they shoaled quick to 2-3/4.</p>

<p>The extensive harbour we had thus unexpectedly found I supposed must
be Western Port, although the narrowness of the entrance did by no
means correspond with the width given to it by Mr. Bass. It was the
information of Captain Baudin, who had coasted along from thence with
fine weather, and had found no inlet of any kind, which had induced
this supposition; and the very great extent of the place, agreeing with
that of Western Port, was in confirmation of it. This however was not
Western Port, as we found next morning; and I congratulated myself on
having made a new and useful discovery, but here again I was in error.
This place, as I afterwards learnt at Port Jackson, had been discovered
ten weeks before by Lieutenant John Murray, who had succeeded Captain
Grant in command of the <i>Lady Nelson</i>. He had given it the name of
Port Phillip, and to the rocky point on the east side of the entrance,
that of Point Nepean.</p>

<p>Before proceeding any higher with the ship, I wished to gain some
knowledge of the form and extent of this great piece of water; and
Arthur's seat being more than a thousand feet high and near the water
side, presented a favourable station for the purpose. After breakfast I
went away in a boat, accompanied by Mr. Brown and some other gentlemen,
for the Seat. I ascended the hill and to my surprise found the Port so
extensive, that even at this elevation its boundary to the northward
could not be distinguished. The western shore extended from the
entrance ten or eleven miles in a northern direction, to the extremity
of what from its appearance I called Indented Head; beyond it was a
wide branch of the port leading to the westward, and I suspected might
have a communication with the sea; for it was almost incredible that
such a vast piece of water should not have a larger outlet than that
through which we had come.</p>

<p>Another considerable piece of water was seen, at the distance of
three or four leagues; as it appeared to have a communication with the
sea to the south, I had no doubt of its being Mr. Bass' Western
Port.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, May 1st.</i> At day-dawn I set off with three of the
boat's crew, for the highest part of the back hills called Station
Peak. One or two miles before arriving at the feet of the hills, we
entered a wood where an emu and a kangaroo were seen at a distance; and
the top of the Peak was reached at ten o'clock. I saw the water of the
Port as far as N.75 E., so that the whole extent of the Port, north and
south, is at least thirty miles.</p>

<p>I left the ship's name on a scroll of paper, deposited in a small
pile of stones upon the top of the peak; and at three in the afternoon,
reached the tent, much fatigued, having walked more than twenty miles
without finding a drop of water.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 2nd May.</i> I find it very difficult to speak in general
terms of Port Phillip. On the one hand it is capable of receiving and
sheltering a larger fleet of ships than ever yet went to sea; whilst on
the other, the entrance on its whole width is scarcely two miles, and
nearly half of it is occupied by rocks lying off Point Nepean, and by
shoals on the opposite side. The depth in the remaining part varies
from 6 to 12 fathoms; and this irregularity causes the strong tides,
especially when running against the wind, to make breakers, in which
small vessels should be careful of engaging themselves; and when a ship
has passed the entrance, the shoals are a great obstacle to a free
passage up the Port.</p>

<p>No runs of fresh water were seen in my excursions; but Mr. Grimes,
Surveyor-General of New South Wales, afterwards found several, and in
particular a small river falling into the Northern head of the Port.
The country surrounding Port Phillip has a pleasing and in many parts a
fertile appearance; and the sides of some of the hills and several of
the valleys are fit for agricultural purposes. It is in great measure
country capable of supporting cattle, though better calculated for
sheep.</p>

<p>Were a settlement to be made at Port Phillip, as doubtless there
will be sometime hereafter, the entrance could be easily defended; and
it would not be difficult to establish a friendly intercourse with the
natives, for they are acquainted with the effect of firearms, and
desirous of possessing many of our conveniences.</p>

<p>In the woods are the kangaroo, the emu or cassowary, paroquets, and
a variety of small birds; the mud banks are frequented by ducks and
some black swans, and the shores by the usual sea fowl common to New
South Wales. The range of the thermometer was between 61 and 67 and the
climate appeared to be as good and agreeable as could well be desired
in the month corresponding to November. In 1803, Colonel C. Collins of
the Marines was sent out from England to make a new settlement in this
country, but he quitted Port Phillip for the South end of Van Diemen's
Land, probably from not finding fresh water for a colony sufficiently
near to the entrance.</p>

<p align="center">PORT JACKSON</p>

<p>On the 4th of June the ship was dressed with colours, a royal salute
fired, and I went with the principal officers of the
<i>Investigator</i> to pay my respects to His Excellency the Governor
and Captain-General in honour of His Majesty's birthday. On this
occasion a splendid dinner was given to the colony; and the number of
ladies and civil, military, and naval officers, was not less than
forty, who met to celebrate the birth of their beloved Sovereign in
this distant part of the earth.</p>

<p>Captain Baudin arrived in the <i>Geographe</i> on the 20th, and a
boat was sent from the <i>Investigator</i> to assist in towing the ship
up to the cove, it was grievous to see the miserable condition to which
both officers and crew were reduced by scurvy; there being not more out
of 170, according to the Commander's account, than twelve men capable
of doing their duty. The sick were received into the Colonial Hospital;
and both French ships furnished with everything in the power of the
Colony to supply. Before their arrival the necessity of augmenting the
number of cattle in the country had prevented the Governor from
allowing us any fresh meat; but some oxen belonging to Government were
now killed for the distressed strangers; and by returning an equal
quantity of salt meat, which was exceedingly scarce at this time, I
obtained a quarter of beef for my people. The distress of the French
navigators had indeed been great, but every means were used by the
Governor and the principal inhabitants of the colony, to make them
forget both their sufferings and the war which existed between the two
nations.</p>

<p><i>July.</i> His Excellency Governor King, had done me the honour to
visit the <i>Investigator</i>, and to accept of a dinner on board; on
which occasion he had been received with the marks of respect due to
his rank of Captain-General; and shortly afterwards, the Captains
Baudin and Hamelin, with Monsieur Peron and some other French officers,
as also Colonel Paterson, the Lieutenant-Governor, did me the same
favour; when they were received under a salute of 11 guns. The
intelligence of peace which had just been received contributed to
enliven the party; and rendered our meeting more particularly
agreeable. I showed to Captain Baudin my charts of the South Coast,
containing the part first explored by him, and distinctly marked as his
discovery. He made no objection to the justice of the limits therein
pointed out; but found his portion to be smaller than he had supposed,
not having before been aware of the extent of the discoveries
previously made by Captain Grant.</p>

<p>After examining the Chart, he said, apparently as a reason for not
producing any of his own, that his charts were not constructed on board
the ship; but that he transmitted to Paris all his bearings and
observations, with a regular series of views of the land and from them
the charts were to be made at a future time.</p>

<p align="center">NAMING THE CONTINENT</p>

<p>Had I permitted myself any innovation upon the original term (Terra
Australis), it would have been to convert it into Australia, as being
more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the
other great portions of the earth.</p>

<p align="center">TO JOHN OXLEY PARKER, ESQ., OF CHELMSFORD, ESSEX</p>

<p class='right'><i>London, Feb. 10th 1823.</i></p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Feelings of gratitude for your kind attention to me in the early
part of life, have induced me to dedicate to you the following short
Journal of my passage over the Blue Mountains, in the colony of New
South Wales, under the persuasion that it will afford you pleasure at
all times to hear that any of your family have been instrumental in
promoting the prosperity of any country in which they may reside,
however distant that country may be from the immediate seat of our
Government.</p>

<p>Devoid as it is of any higher pretensions than belong to it as a
plain unvarnished statement, it may not be deemed wholly uninteresting,
when it is considered what important alterations the result of the
expedition has produced in the immediate interests and prosperity of
the Colony. This appears in nothing more decidedly than the unlimited
pasturage already afforded to the very fine flocks of Merino Sheep, as
well as the extensive field opened for the exertions of the present, as
well as future generations. It has changed the aspect of the Colony,
from a confined insulated tract of land, to a rich and extensive
continent.</p>

<p>This expedition, which has proved so completely successful, resulted
from two previous attempts. One of these was made by water, by His
Excellency the Governor, in person, whom I accompanied.</p>

<p>The other expedition was undertaken by myself, attended by three
European servants and two natives, with a horse to carry provisions and
other necessities. We returned sooner than I intended, owing to one man
being taken ill. This journey confirmed me in the opinion, that it was
practicable to find a passage over the mountains, and I resolved at
some future period to attempt it.</p>

<p>Soon after, I mentioned the circumstance to His Excellency the
Governor, who thought it reasonable, and expressed a wish that I should
make the attempt. Having made every requisite preparation, I applied to
the two gentlemen who accompanied me, to join in the expedition, and
was fortunate in obtaining their consent.</p>

<p>To these gentlemen I have to express my thanks for their company and
to acknowledge that without their assistance I should have had but
little chance of success.</p>

<p>The road which has since been made deviates but a few rods in some
places from the line cleared of the small trees and bushes, and marked
by us. Nor does it appear likely that any other line of road will ever
be discovered than at the difficult and narrow passes that we were
fortunate to discover, by improving which a good carriage road has now
been made across the mountains. Mount York is the Western summit of the
mountains, the vale Clwyd, the first valley at their feet from which a
mountain (afterwards named Mount Blaxland by His Excellency Governor
Macquarie) is about eight miles; which terminated our journey.</p>

<p>I remain, dear sir, most respectfully,</p>

<p align="center">Your affectionate nephew,</p>

<p class='right'>G. BLAXLAND.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, May 11, 1813, Mr. Gregory Blaxland, Mr. William
Wentworth, and Lieutenant Lawson, attended by four servants, with five
dogs and four horses, laden with provisions, ammunition, and other
necessaries, left Mr. Blaxland's farm at the South Creek, for the
purpose of endeavouring to effect a passage over the Blue Mountains,
between the Western River, and the River Grose.</p>

<p>On the following morning (May the 12th) as soon as the heavy dew was
off, which was about nine a.m., they proceeded to ascend the ridge at
the foot of which they had camped the preceding evening. After
travelling about a mile on the third day in a west and north-west
direction, they arrived at a large tract of forest land, rather hilly,
the grass and timber tolerably good. They computed it as two thousand
acres. Here they found a track marked by a European, by cutting the
bark of the trees. They had not proceeded above two miles, when they
found themselves stopped by a brushwood, much thicker than they had
hitherto met with. This induced them to alter their course, and to
endeavour to find another passage to the westward, but every ridge
which they explored proved to terminate in a deep rocky precipice, and
they had no alternative but to return to the thick brushwood, which
appeared to be the main ridge, with the determination to cut a way
through for the horses the next day.</p>

<p>On the next morning, leaving two men to take care of the horses and
provisions, they proceeded to cut a path through the thick brushwood,
on what they considered as the main ridge of the mountains, between the
Western River, and the River Grose. They now began to mark their track
by cutting the bark of the trees on two sides. Having cut their way for
about five miles, they returned in the evening to the spot on which
they had encamped the night before. The fifth day was spent in
prosecuting the same tedious operation, but, as much time was
necessarily lost in walking twice over the track cleared the day
before, they were unable to cut away more than two miles further. They
found no food for the horses the whole way.</p>

<p>On Sunday, they rested and arranged their future plans. They had
reason, however, to regret this suspension of their proceedings, as it
gave the men leisure to ruminate on their danger, and it was for some
time doubtful whether, on the next day, they could be persuaded to
venture farther.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 19th, the party moved forward, bearing chiefly
west, and west-south-east. They now began to ascend the second ridge of
the mountains, and from this elevation they obtained for the first time
an extensive view of the settlements below.</p>

<p>At a little distance from the spot at which they began the ascent,
they found a pyramidical heap of stones, the work, evidently, of some
European, one side of which the natives had opened, probably in the
expectation of finding some treasure deposited in it. This pile they
concluded to be the one erected by Mr. Bass, to mark the end of his
journey. That gentleman attempted some time ago to pass the Mountains,
and to penetrate into the interior, but having got thus far, he gave up
the undertaking as impracticable, reporting, on his return, that it was
impossible to find a passage even for a person on foot. Here,
therefore, the party had the satisfaction of believing that they had
penetrated as far as any European had been before them.</p>

<p>[This, however, proved to be Caley's Cairn.]</p>

<p><i>May 21st.</i>&mdash;Their progress the next day was nearly four
miles. They encamped in the middle of the day at the head of a
well-watered swamp, about five acres in extent; pursuing, as before,
their operations in the afternoon. In the beginning of the night the
dogs ran off and barked violently. At the same time something was
distinctly heard to run through the brushwood, which they supposed to
be one of the horses got loose; but they had reason to believe
afterwards that they had been in great danger&mdash;that the natives
had followed their tracks, and advanced on them in the night, intending
to have speared them by the light of their fire, but that the dogs
drove them off.</p>

<p>On the top of this ridge they found about two acres of land clear of
trees, covered with loose stones and short coarse grass, such as grows
on some of the commons of England. Over this heath they proceeded about
a mile and a half, and encamped by the side of a fine stream of water,
with just wood enough on the banks to serve for firewood. From the
summit they had a fine view of all the settlements and country
eastwards, and of a great extent of country to the westward and
south-west. But their progress in both the latter directions was
stopped by an impassable barrier of rock, which appeared to divide the
interior from the coast as with a stone wall, rising perpendicularly
out of the side of the mountain. In the afternoon they left their
little camp in the charge of three of the men, and made an attempt to
descend the precipice by following some of the streams of water, or by
getting down at some of the projecting points where the rocks had
fallen in; but they were baffled in every instance. In some places the
perpendicular height of the rocks above the earth below could not be
less than four hundred feet.</p>

<p>On the 28th they proceeded about five miles and three-quarters. Not
being able to find water, they did not halt till five o'clock, when
they took up their station on the edge of the precipice. To their great
satisfaction they discovered, that what they had supposed to be sandy,
barren land below the mountain, was forest land, covered with good
grass, and with timber of an inferior quality. In the evening they
contrived to get their horses down the mountain by cutting a small
trench with a hoe, which kept them from slipping, where they again
tasted grass for the first time since they left the forest land on the
other side of the mountain. They were getting into miserable condition.
Water was found about two miles below the foot of the mountain. In this
day's route little timber was observed fit for building.</p>

<p>On the 29th, having got up the horses and laden them, they began to
descend the mountain at seven o'clock, through a pass in the rock about
thirty feet wide, which they had discovered the day before, when the
want of water put them on the alert. Part of the descent was so steep
that the horses could but just keep their footing, without a load, so
that, for some way the party were obliged to carry the packages
themselves. A cart-road might, however, easily be made by cutting a
slanting trench along the side of the mountain, which is here covered
with earth.</p>

<p>They reached the foot at nine o'clock a.m., and proceeded two miles,
mostly through open meadow land, clear of trees, the grass from two to
three feet high. They encamped on the bank of a fine stream of water.
The natives, as observed by the smoke of their fires, moved before
them, as yesterday. The dogs killed a kangaroo, which was very
acceptable, as the party had lived on salt meat since they caught the
last. The timber seen this day appeared rotten and unfit for
building.</p>

<p>The climate here was found very much colder than that of the
mountain or of the settlements on the east side, where no signs of
frost had made its appearance when the party set out. During the night
the ground was covered with a thick frost, and a leg of the kangaroo
was quite frozen.</p>

<p>They now conceived that they had sufficiently accomplished the
design of their undertaking, having surmounted all the difficulties
which had hitherto prevented the interior of the country from being
explored, and the Colony from being extended. They had partly cleared,
or, at least, marked out a road by which the passage of the mountain
might easily be effected. Their provisions were nearly exhausted, their
clothes and shoes were in very bad condition, and the whole party were
ill with bowel complaints. These considerations determined them,
therefore, to return home by the track they came. On Tuesday, the 1st
of June, they arrived at the foot of the mountain which they had
descended, where they encamped for the night.</p>

<p>The following day they began to ascend the mountain at seven
o'clock, and reached the summit at ten; they were obliged to carry the
packages themselves part of the ascent.</p>

<p>They encamped in the evening at one of their old stations. On the
3rd, they reached another of their old stations. Here, during the
night, they heard a confused noise arising from the eastern settlements
below, which, after having been so long accustomed to the death-like
stillness of the interior, had a very striking effect. On the 4th, they
arrived at the end of their marked track, and encamped in the forest
land where they had cut the grass for their horses. One of the horses
fell this day with his load, quite exhausted, and was with difficulty
got on, after having his load put on the other horses. The next day,
the 5th, was the most unpleasant and fatiguing they had experienced.
The track not being marked, they had great difficulty in finding their
way back to the river, which they did not reach till four p.m. o'clock.
They then once more encamped for the night to refresh themselves and
the horses. They had no provisions now left except a little flour, but
procured some from the settlement on the other side of the river. On
Sunday, the 6th of June, they crossed the river after breakfast, and
reached their homes all in good health. The winter had not set in on
this side of the mountain, nor had there been any frost.</p>

<p>The country between Botany Bay and Bass Strait was unexplored until

Phillip. Oct. 2nd, 1824&mdash;Jan. 16th, 1825.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Sat., Nov. 6th.</i> They had now (it was noon) unexpectedly
reached the S.W. extremity of the ridge or spine, which here terminates
in an abrupt and very steep descent: the view from this spot consists
of a valley (immediately in their front, S.) extending in the direction
S.W., and varying from one to two miles in breadth. Along the centre of
this valley runs a small stream, and near by the stream is a broken
mountainous country: the view is closed by mountains, both of a
different form (peaked) and of an infinitely greater height than any
which they had yet seen. They now descended the table range, pursuing
the zig-zag course of one of the tributaries of the stream which they
had observed in the valley, taking its rise in these mountains, not far
below the spot at which they commence making their descent.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the evening they arrive in the valley. At seven,
having still pursued their course along the same branch, they come to
the main stream. In effecting the descent from these mountains, they
had nearly lost one of the party, as well as a bullock; the animal had
fallen when it had reached about two-thirds down the mountain in
consequence of a stone slipping under its feet, and in its fall it had
forced down with it the man who was leading it. But their fall was
intercepted by a large tree, and the man as well as the animal was thus
prevented from being dashed to pieces. The man, however, unfortunately
was much hurt.</p>

<p>Never was the great superiority of bullocks to horses (in some
respects) for journeys of this description more observable than in the
passage of this difficult and dangerous ascent. The horses it had
become indispensable to unload, and to conduct each separately with
great care; but if one of the bullocks be led the rest follow; the
horse is timid and hurried in its action in places where there is
danger; the bullock is steady and cautious. If the latter slip in its
ascent, or if the acclivity be too steep for its usual mode of
progression, the animal kneels down, and scrambles up in this posture.
If it be descending, and it become placed in a similar predicament, it
sits down, and turns its head round towards the ascent, as if to
balance its body. For the crossing of unsound or boggy ground, the
structure of its hoof is particularly adapted, while the foot of the
horse, on the contrary, is ill suited for this purpose, and for which
the fears and consequent agitation of the animal renders it unfit.</p>

<p>(Bullocks ought, when used for these journeys, to be shod; their
feet, otherwise, are very liable to become disabled.)</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Nov. 16th.</i> Soon after sunrise they recommence their
journey, having proceeded three and a half miles S. (the land gradually
sloping as they advanced), arrive suddenly on the banks of a fine
river. This was named "The Hume."</p>

<p>This beautiful stream is found to be not less than 80 yards in
breadth, apparently of considerable depth; the current at three miles
an hour; the water, for so considerable a stream, clear.</p>

<p>The river itself is serpentine, the banks clothed with verdure to
the water's edge, their general height various, but seldom either more
or less than eight or nine feet, inclined or precipitous, as they
happen by the bending of the stream to be more or less exposed to the
action of the current. On each side of the river is a perpetual
succession of lagoons extending generally in length from one to two
miles, and about a quarter of a mile in breadth. These, which are
situate alternately on each side of the river, within those elbows and
projections which are formed by its windings, often for miles together,
preclude any approach to its banks. Each of these lagoons was furnished
with an inlet from the river and an outlet into it.</p>

<p>In general, the spaces between the lagoons and the river are thickly
wooded (the trees consisting principally of the blue gum of a large
growth), and are overgrown with vines of various descriptions, and the
fern, the peppermint, flax plant, and currajong. The fern, currajong,
and the flax flourish here in abundance, and the peppermint plant
(which they had not seen in any other part of the country) seems to
surpass, both in odour and taste the species that is generally produced
in our gardens.</p>

<p>From the flax-plant the natives, as they afterwards discover, make
their fishing-lines and nets for carrying their travelling gear and
provisions.</p>

<p>Unable to devise any means of crossing the river, and in hope of
discovering some practicable ford, they now commence their progress
down the stream, proceed three miles and a half, and then halt. At
half-past two they resume their route, but are soon compelled from the
continual succession of lagoon and swamp to return to some higher land,
about two miles from the river.</p>

<p>[Crossing the river with difficulty, they travelled southwards for
four weeks.]</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Dec. 16th.</i>&mdash;This morning they cross the river
or creek without difficulty, the water not taking the cattle more than
chest high. They now proceed S.W. by S. through the plains about six
miles, when they are struck with an appearance respecting which they
cannot decide whether it is that of burning grass or of distant
water.</p>

<p>They now therefore, having altered their course to the south, at
four o'clock, have the gratification satisfactorily to determine, that
the appearance which had just created so much doubt is that of the
latter object, and which leaving the river a short distance, and
directing their march from S.W. to SS.W. they soon ascertain to be part
of the sea&mdash;the so long and ardently desired bourn of their
labours. They now again alter their course to south-west and travel six
miles in that direction along the shore, over excellent land, but clear
of timber. On the downs, or plains to-day they had seen several flocks
of emus and wild turkeys. The water near the shore was covered with
waterfowl of various descriptions, some of which were new to them, and
by the time they had halted for the night, they had procured an ample
supply of black swans and ducks. They stopped for the night at seven
o'clock in a small wood, at a mile from the beach, but where there was
no fresh water, having travelled to-day, they supposed, upwards of
twenty miles.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Dec. 17th.</i> They proceed this morning from the beach
in a direction about N.N.W. three or four miles in quest of water, when
they arrive on the banks of a creek, where they have the good fortune
to find abundance of good water and of grass. Here they remain the day,
in order to refresh the cattle, who are not a little in want of this
timely relief, more particularly as it is proposed to commence their
return to-morrow. This determination of so soon retracing their steps,
though it cost them much regret, had become indispensable, not only
from the extreme scantiness of their remaining supplies, and the
certainty of the many difficulties they would have to encounter, but
still more so from consideration that the mere circumstance of a fall
of rain by swelling the streams, might, in the weak and ill-provided
state to which the whole party were reduced, render their return
altogether impracticable. (Four weeks' flour at reduced allowance and a
small quantity of tea and sugar, but no animal food; independently of
which, the ropes and other material employed for crossing streams were
now almost utterly unfit for use.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reedy marshes in which the Lachlan and the Macquarie appeared to
end blocked Western exploration until the protracted drought of the
twenties convinced Sturt and Hume that they would be passable.
Accordingly an expedition was formed which was to solve the long
debated problem of the character of the interior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The year 1826 was remarkable for the commencement of one of those
fearful droughts to which we have reason to believe the climate of New
South Wales is periodically subject. It continued the two following
years with unabated severity. The surface of the earth became so
parched up that minor vegetation ceased upon it. Culinary herbs were
raised with difficulty, and crops failed even in the most favourable
situations. Settlers drove their flocks and herds to distant tracts for
pasture and water, neither remaining for them in the located districts.
The interior suffered equally with the coast, and men at length began
to despond under so alarming a visitation. It almost appeared as if the
Australian sky were never again to be traversed by a cloud.</p>

<p>But, however severe for the colony the seasons had proved, or were
likely to prove, it was borne in mind at this critical moment that the
wet and swampy state of the interior had alone prevented Mr. Oxley from
penetrating further into it in 1818.</p>

<p>The immediate fitting out of an expedition was therefore decided
upon, for the express purpose of ascertaining the nature and extent of
that basin into which the Macquarie was supposed to fall, and whether
connection existed between it and the streams falling westerly. As I
had early taken a great interest in the geography of New South Wales,
the Governor was pleased to appoint me to the command of this
expedition.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 3.</i> The first part of our journey was over rich flats,
timbered sufficiently to afford a shade, on which the grass was
luxuriant; but we were obliged to seek open ground, in consequence of
the frequent stumbling of the cattle.</p>

<p>We issued, at length, upon a plain, the view across which was as
dreary as can be imagined; in many places without a tree, save a few
old stumps left by the natives when they fired the timber, some of
which were still smoking in different parts of it. Observing some lofty
trees at the extremity of the plain, we moved towards them, under an
impression that they indicated the river line. But on this exposed spot
the sun's rays fell with intense power upon us, and the dust was so
minute and penetrating, that I soon regretted having left the shady
banks of the river.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 31.</i> I had no inducement to proceed further into the
interior. I had been sufficiently disappointed in the termination of
this excursion, and the track before me was still less inviting.
Nothing but a dense forest, and a level country, existed between me and
a distant hill. I had learnt, by experience, that it was impossible to
form any opinion of the probable features of so singular a region as
that in which I was wandering, from previous appearances, or to expect
the same result, as in other countries, from similar causes. In a
geographical point of view, my journey had been more successful, and
had enabled me to put to rest for ever a question of much previous
doubt. I had gained a knowledge of more than 100 miles of the western
interior, and had ascertained that no sea, indeed, that little water
existed on its surface; and that, although it is flat generally, it
still has elevations of considerable magnitude upon it.</p>

<p>Although I had passed over much barren ground, I had likewise
noticed soil that was far from poor, and the vegetation upon which in
ordinary seasons would, I am convinced, have borne a very different
aspect.</p>

<p>Yet, upon the whole, the space I traversed is unlikely to become the
haunts of civilized man, or will only become so in isolated spots, as a
chain of connection to a more fertile country; if such a country exist
to the westward.</p>

<p>[A report of better country to the North induced Sturt to turn in
that direction.]</p>

<p><i>Jan. 14.</i> Nothing could exceed in dreariness the appearance of
the tracks through which we journeyed on this and the two following
days. The creek on which we depended for a supply of water, gave such
alarming indications of a total failure that I at one time had serious
thoughts of abandoning my pursuit of it. We passed hollow after hollow
that had successively dried up, although originally of considerable
depth; and, when we at length found water, it was doubtful how far we
could make use of it. Sometimes in boiling, it left a sediment nearly
equal to half its body; at other times it was so bitter as to be quite
unpalatable. That on which we subsisted was scraped up from small
puddles, heated by the sun's rays; and so uncertain were we of finding
water at the end of the day's journey, that we were obliged to carry a
supply on one of the bullocks. There was scarcely a living creature,
even of the feathered race, to be seen to break the stillness of the
forest. The native dogs alone wandered about, though they had scarcely
strength to avoid us; and their melancholy howl, breaking in upon the
ear at the dead of night, only served to impress more fully on the mind
the absolute loneliness of the desert.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 31.</i> We came upon a creek, but could not decide whether
it was the one for which we had been searching, or another. It had
flooded-gum growing upon its banks, and, on places apparently subject
to flood, a number of tall straight saplings were observed by us. We
returned to the camp, after a vain search for water, and were really at
a loss what direction next to pursue. The men kept the cattle pretty
well together, and, as we were not delayed by any preparations for
breakfast, they were saddled and loaded at an early hour. The
circumstance of there having been natives in the neighbourhood, of whom
we had seen so few traces of late, assured me that water was at hand,
but in what direction it was impossible to guess. As the path we had
observed was leading northerly, we took up that course, and had not
proceeded more than a mile upon it, when we suddenly found ourselves on
the bank of a noble river. Such it might in truth be called, where
water was scarcely to be found. The party drew up upon a bank that was
from forty to forty-five feet above the level of the stream. The
channel of the river was from seventy to eighty yards broad, and
enclosed an unbroken sheet of water, evidently very deep, and literally
covered with pelicans and other wild fowl. Our surprise and delight
maybe better imagined than described. Our difficulties seemed to be at
an end, for here was a river that promised to reward all our exertions,
and which appeared every moment to increase in importance, to our
imagination. Coming from the N.E., and flowing to the S.W., it had a
capacity of channel that proved that we were as far from its source as
from its termination. The paths of the natives on either side of it
were like well-trodden roads; and the trees that overhung it were of
beautiful and gigantic growth.</p>

<p>Its banks were too precipitous to allow of our watering the cattle,
but the men eagerly descended to quench their thirst, which a powerful
sun had contributed to increase, nor shall I ever forget the looks of
terror and disappointment with which they called out to inform me that
the water was so salt as to be unfit to drink! This was, indeed, too
true; on tasting it, I found it extremely nauseous, and strongly
impregnated with salt, being apparently a mixture of sea and fresh
water. Whence this arose, whether from local causes, or from a
communication with some inland sea, I know not, but the discovery was
certainly a blow for which I was not prepared. Our hopes were
annihilated at the moment of their apparent realization. The cup of joy
was dashed out of our hands before we had time to raise it to our lips.
Notwithstanding this disappointment, we proceeded down the river, and
halted at about five miles, being influenced by the goodness of the
feed to provide for the cattle as well as circumstances would permit.
They would not drink of the river water, but stood covered in it for
many hours, having their noses alone exposed above the stream. Their
condition gave me great uneasiness. It was evident they could not long
hold out under the excessive thirst, and unless we should procure some
fresh water, it would be impossible for us to continue our journey.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume, with his usual perseverance, walked out when the camp was
formed; and at a little distance from it, ascended a ridge of pure
sand, crowned with cypresses. From this he descended to the westward,
and, at length, struck upon the river, where a reef of rocks crossed
its channel and formed a dry passage from one side to the other; but
the bend which the river must have taken appeared to him so singular,
that he doubted whether it was the same beside which we had been
travelling during the day. Curiosity led him to cross it, when he found
a small pond of fresh water on a tongue of land, and immediately
afterwards, returned to acquaint me with the welcome tidings. It was
too late to move, but we had the prospect of a comfortable breakfast in
the morning.</p>

<p>On the 6th February we journeyed again through a barren scrub,
although on firmer ground, and passed numerous groups of huts. At about
eight miles from our last encampment, we came upon the river where its
banks were of considerable height. In riding along them Mr. Hume
thought he observed a current running, and he called to inform me of
the circumstance. On a closer examination we discovered some springs in
the very bed of the river, from which a considerable stream was
gushing, and from the incrustation around them, we had no difficulty in
guessing at their nature; in fact, they were brine springs, and I
collected a quantity of salt from the brink of them.</p>

<p>After such a discovery we could not hope to keep our position. No
doubt the current we had observed on first reaching the river was
caused by springs that had either escaped our notice, or were under
water. Here was at length a local cause for its saltness that destroyed
at once the anticipation and hope of our being near its termination,
and, consequently, the ardour with which we should have pressed on to
decide so interesting a point.</p>

<p>We calculated that we were forty miles from the camp, in a S.W.
direction, a fearful distance under our circumstances, since we could
not hope to obtain relief for two days. Independently, however, of the
state of the animals, our spirits were damped by the nature of the
country, and the change which had taken place in the soil, upon which
it was impossible that water could rest; while the general appearance
of the interior showed how much it suffered from drought. On the other
hand, although the waters of the river had become worse to the taste,
the river itself had increased in size and stretched away to the
westward, with all the uniformity of a magnificent canal, and gave
every promise of increasing importance; while the pelicans were in such
numbers upon it as to be quite dazzling to the eye. Considering,
however, that perseverance would only involve us in extricable
difficulties, and that it would also be useless to risk the horses,
since we had gained a distance to which the bullocks could not have
been brought I intimated my intention of giving up the further pursuit
of the river, though it was with extreme reluctance that I did so.</p>

<p>As soon as we had bathed and finished our scanty meal, I took the
bearings of D'Urban's Group, and found them to be S.58 E. about
thirty-three miles distant; and as we mounted our horses, I named the
river the "Darling," as a lasting memorial of the respect I bear the
Governor.</p>

<p>I should be doing injustice to Mr. Hume and my men if I did not
express my conviction that they were extremely unwilling to yield to
circumstances, and that, had I determined on continuing the journey,
they would have followed me with cheerfulness, whatever the
consequences might have been.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On his first expedition Sturt had proved that the interior was dry.
He then attempted to find the destination of the Morumbidgee and the
Darling. Travelling down the Morumbidgee he discovered the Murray and
followed it to its termination, 1829.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Dec. 27th.</i> M'Leay and I started at an early hour on an
excursion of deeper interest than any we had as yet undertaken; to
examine the reeds, not only for the purpose of ascertaining their
extent, if possible, but also to guide us in our future measures. We
rode some miles along the river side, but observed in it no signs
either of increase or of exhaustion. Everything tended to strengthen my
conviction that we were still far from the termination of the river. I
was aware that my resolves must be instant, decisive, and immediately
acted upon, as on firmness and promptitude at this crisis the success
of the expedition depended. About noon I checked my horse, and rather
to the surprise of my companion, intimated to him my intention of
returning to the camp. He naturally asked what I purposed doing. I told
him that it appeared to me more than probable that the Morumbidgee
would hold its course good to some fixed point, now that it had reached
a meridian beyond the known rivers of the interior. It was certain,
from the denseness of the reeds, and the breadth of the belts, that the
teams could not be brought any further, and that, taking everything
into consideration, I had resolved on a bold and desperate measure,
that of building the whaleboat, and sending home the drays.</p>

<p>Our appearance in camp so suddenly surprised the men not more than
the orders I gave. They all thought I had struck on some remarkable
change of country, and were anxious to know my ultimate views. It was
not my intention, however, immediately to satisfy their curiosity. I
had to study their characters as long as I could in order to select
those best qualified to accompany me on the desperate adventure for
which I was preparing.</p>

<p>[Sturt accordingly built the whaleboat and embarked on the
river.]</p>

<p><i>Jan. 14th.</i> The men looked anxiously out ahead, for the
singular change in the river had impressed on them an idea that we were
approaching its termination, or near some adventure. On a sudden, the
river took a general southern direction, but, in its tortuous course,
swept round to every point of the compass with the greatest
irregularity. We were carried at a fearful rate down its gloomy and
contracted banks, and, in such a moment of excitement, had little time
to pay attention to the country through which we were passing. It was,
however, observed that chalybeate springs were numerous close to the
water's edge. At 3 p.m. Hopkinson called out that we were approaching a
junction, and in less than a minute afterwards we were hurried into a
broad and noble river.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to describe the effect of so instantaneous a
change upon us. The boats were allowed to drift along at pleasure, and
such was the force with which we had been shot out of the Morumbidgee
that we were carried nearly to the bank opposite its <i>embouchure</i>,
whilst we continued to gaze in silent astonishment at the capacious
channel we had entered; and when we looked for that by which we had
been led into it, we could hardly believe that the insignificant gap
that presented itself to us was, indeed, the termination of the
beautiful and noble stream whose course we had thus successfully
followed. I can only compare the relief we experienced to that which
the seaman feels on weathering the rock upon which he expected his
vessel to have struck, to the calm which succeeds moments of feverish
anxiety, when the dread of danger is succeeded by certainty of
escape.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 23rd.</i> Not having as yet given a name to our first
discovery, I laid it down as the Murray River in compliment to the
distinguished officer Sir George Murray, who then presided over the
Colonial Department, not only in compliance with the known wishes of
His Excellency, General Darling, but also in accordance with my own
feelings as a soldier.</p>

<p>[They continued their course down the Murray till Feb. 9.]</p>

<p>After pulling a mile or two we found a clear horizon before us to
the south. The hills still continued upon our left, but we could not
see any elevation over the expanse of reeds to our right. The river
inclined to the left, and swept the base of the hills that still
continued on that side. I consequently landed once more to survey the
country.</p>

<p>I still retained a strong impression on my mind that some change was
at hand, and on this occasion I was not disappointed, but the view was
one for which I was not altogether prepared. We had at length arrived
at the termination of the Murray. Immediately below me was a beautiful
lake, which appeared to be a fitting reservoir for the noble stream
that led us to it; and which was now ruffled by the breeze that swept
over it. The ranges were more distinctly visible, stretching from south
to north, and were certainly distant forty miles. They had a regular
unbroken outline; declining gradually to the south, but terminating
abruptly at a lofty mountain northerly. I had no doubt on my mind of
this being the Mount Lofty of Captain Flinders; or that the range was
that immediately to the eastward of St. Vincent's Gulf. Between us and
the ranges a beautiful promontory shot into the lake, being a
continuation of the right bank of the Murray. Over this promontory the
waters stretched to the base of the ranges, and formed an extensive
bay. To the S.W. a bold headland showed itself; beyond which, to the
westward, there was a clear and open sea visible, through a strait
formed by this headland and a point projecting from the opposite shore.
Even while gazing on this fine scene, I could not but regret that the
Murray had thus terminated; for I immediately foresaw that, in all
probability, we should be disappointed in finding any practicable
communication between the lake and the ocean, as it was evident that
the former was not much influenced by tides. We pitched our tents on a
low track of land that stretched away seemingly for many miles directly
behind us to the eastward. It was of the richest soil, being of a black
vegetable deposit, and although high above the influence the lake had,
it was evident, once formed a part of its bed. Thirty-three days had
now passed over our heads since we left the depot upon the Morumbidgee,
twenty-six of which had been passed upon the Murray. We had, at length,
arrived at the grand reservoir of those waters whose course and fate
had previously been involved in such obscurity.</p>

<p>I took Fraser with me, and, accompanied by M'Leay, crossed the
sand-hummocks behind us, and descended to the sea-shore. I found that
we had struck the south coast deep in the bight of Encounter Bay. We
had no time for examination, but returned immediately to the camp, as I
intended to give the men an opportunity to go to the beach. They
accordingly went and bathed, and returned not only highly delighted at
this little act of good nature on my part, but loaded with cockles, a
bed of which they had managed to find among the sand. Clayton had tied
one end of his shirt up, and brought a bag full, and amused himself
with boiling cockles all night long.</p>

<p>I would fain have lingered on my way to examine, as far as
circumstances would permit, the beautiful country between the lake and
the ranges; and it was with heartfelt sorrow that I yielded to
necessity. My men were, indeed, very weak from poverty of diet and from
great bodily fatigue. Hopkinson, Mulholland, and Macnamee were
miserably reduced.</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that our difficulties were just about to
commence, when those of most other travellers have ceased; and that
instead of being assisted by the stream whose course we had followed,
we had now to contend against the united waters of the eastern ranges,
with diminished strength, and in some measure with disappointed
feelings.</p>

<p>Under the most favourable circumstances, it was improbable that the
men would be enabled to pull for many days longer in succession since
they had not rested upon their oars for a single day, if I except our
passage across the lake, from the moment when we started from the
depot; nor was it possible for me to buoy them up with the hope even of
a momentary cessation of labour. We had calculated the time to which
our supply of provisions would last under the most favourable
circumstances, and it was only in the event of our pulling up against
the current, day after day, the same distance we had compassed with the
current in our favour, that we could hope they would last as long as we
continued in the Murray. But in the event of floods or any unforeseen
delay, it was impossible to calculate at what moment we might be driven
to extremity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it was sufficiently evident to me that the men
were too much exhausted to perform the task that was before them
without assistance, and that it would be necessary both for M'Leay and
myself to take our share of labour at the oars. The cheerfulness and
satisfaction that my young friend evinced at the opportunity that was
thus afforded him of making himself useful, and of relieving those
under him from some portion of their toil, at the same time that they
increased my sincere esteem for him, were nothing more than what I
expected from one who had endeavoured by every means in his power to
contribute to the success of that enterprise upon which he had
embarked. But although I have said thus much of the exhausted condition
of the men, I would by no means be understood to say that they flagged
for a moment, or that a single murmur escaped them. No reluctance was
visible, no complaint was heard, but there was that in their aspect and
appearance which they could not hide, and which I could not mistake. We
re-entered the river on the 13th under as fair prospects as we could
have desired. The gale which had blown with such violence in the
morning gradually abated, and a steady breeze enabled us to pass our
first encampment, by availing ourselves of it as long as daylight
continued.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 18th.</i> The breezes that had so much assisted us from the
lake upwards, had now lost their influence, or failed to reach to the
distance we had gained. Calms succeeded them, and obliged us to labour
continually at the oars. We lost ground fast, and it was astonishing to
remark how soon the men's spirits drooped again under their first
efforts. They fancied the boat pulled heavily and that her bottom was
foul, but such was not the case. The current was not so strong as when
we passed down, since the river had evidently fallen more than a foot,
and was so shallow in several places that we were obliged to haul the
boat over them. On these occasions we were necessarily obliged to get
out of her into the water, and had afterwards to sit still and to allow
the sun to dry our clothes upon us. The unemployed consequently envied
those at the oars, as they sat shivering in their dripping clothes.</p>

<p>I have omitted to mention one remarkable trait of the good
disposition of all the men while on the coast. Our sugar had held out
to that point; but it appeared when we examined the stores that six
pounds alone remained in the cask. This the men positively refused to
touch. They said that, divided, it would benefit nobody; that they
hoped M'Leay and I would use it, that it would last us for some time,
and that they were better able to submit to privations than we were.
The feeling did them infinite credit, and the circumstance is not
forgotten by me. The little supply the kindness of our men left to us
was, however, soon exhausted, and poor M'Leay preferred pure water to
the bitter draught that remained. I have been sometimes unable to
refrain from smiling as I watched the distorted countenances of my
humble companions while drinking their tea and eating their damper.</p>

<p><i>March 17th.</i> We had been drawing nearer the Morumbidgee every
day; and the following afternoon, to our great joy, we turned our boat
into the gloomy and narrow channel of the tributary. Our feelings were
almost as strong when we re-entered it as they had been when we were
launched from it into that river, on whose waters we had continued for
upwards of fifty-five days; during which period, including the sweeps
and bends it made, we could not have travelled less than 1,500
miles.</p>

<p>Our daily journeys were short, and the head we made against the
stream but trifling. The men lost the proper and muscular jerk with
which they once made the waters foam and the oars bend. Their whole
bodies swung with an awkward and laboured motion. Their arms appeared
to be nerveless; their faces became haggard, their persons emaciated,
their spirits wholly sunk; nature was so completely overcome, that from
mere exhaustion they frequently fell asleep during their painful and
almost ceaseless exertions. It grieved me to the heart to see them in
such a state at the close of so perilous a service, and I began to
reproach Robert Harris that he did not move down the river to meet us;
but, in fact, he was not to blame. I became captious, and found fault
where there was no occasion, and lost the equilibrium of my temper in
contemplating the condition of my companions. No murmur, however,
escaped them, nor did a complaint reach me that was intended to
indicate that they had done all they could do. I frequently heard them
in their tent, when they thought I had dropped asleep, complaining of
severe pains, and of great exhaustion. "I must tell the Captain,
to-morrow," some of them would say, "that I can pull no longer."
To-morrow came, and they pulled on, as if reluctant to yield to
circumstances. Macnamee at length lost his senses. We first observed
this from his incoherent conversation, but eventually from his manner.
He related the most extraordinary tales and fidgetted about eternally
while in the boat. I felt it necessary, therefore, to relieve him from
the oars.</p>

<p><i>April 12th.</i> I determined on sending Hopkinson and Mulholland,
whose devotion, intelligence and indefatigable spirits I well knew,
forward to the plain.</p>

<p>The joy this intimation spread was universal. Both Hopkinson and
Mulholland readily undertook the journey, and I, accordingly, prepared
orders for them to start by the earliest dawn.</p>

<p>Six days had passed since their departure; we remaining encamped. I
had calculated on seeing Hopkinson again in eight days, but as the
morrow would see us without food, I thought, as the men had had a
little rest, it would be better to advance towards relief than to await
its arrival.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th, therefore, we buried our specimens and
other stores, intending to break up the camp in the morning. A singular
bird, which invariably passed it at an hour after sunset, and which,
from the heavy flight, appeared to be of unusual size, had so attracted
my notice, that in the evening M'Leay and I crossed the river in hope
to get a shot at it. We had, however, hardly landed on the other side,
when a loud shout called us back to witness the return of our
comrades.</p>

<p>They were both of them in a state that beggars description. Their
knees and ankles were dreadfully swollen and their limbs so painful
that as soon as they arrived in the camp they sunk under their efforts,
but they met us with a smiling countenance and expressed their
satisfaction at having come so seasonably to our relief. They had, as I
had foreseen, found Robert Harris on the plain, which they reached on
the evening of the third day. They had started early the next morning
on their return with such supplies as they thought we might immediately
want. Poor Macnamee had in a great measure recovered, but for some days
he was sullen and silent; the sight of the drays gave him uncommon
satisfaction. Clayton gorged himself; but M'Leay, myself, and Fraser
could not at first relish the meat that was placed before us.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_INTERIOR_II" id="THE_INTERIOR_II"></a>THE INTERIOR.
II</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Life of Charles Sturt (Mrs. N.G. Sturt), pp.
230-232, 264-267, 279-280</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Observations of the migrations of birds convinced Sturt that there
was good land in the interior of New South Wales, and in 1844 he set
out to find it. His expedition failed because the season was
exceptionally dry, and he was obliged to turn back before he had
accomplished his object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"If a line be drawn from Lat. 29&deg; 30&acute; and Long. 140&deg;
N.W., and another from Mount Arden due north, they will meet a little
to the northward of the tropic, and there I will be bound to say a fine
country will be discovered." On what date Sturt pledges himself to the
discovery of this fine country is not stated, but when later regretting
his failure to reach the tropic and to set at rest his hypothesis of
the better country to be found there, he briefly tells his reason for
the supposition.</p>

<p>"Birds observed east of the Darling in the summer of 1828 in about
lat. 29&deg; 30&acute; S. and long. 144&deg; had invariably migrated to
the W.N.W. Cockatoos and parrots, known while in the colony to frequent
the richest and best-watered valleys of the higher lands, would pass in
countless flights to that point of the compass. In South Australia, in
lat. 35&deg; and long. 138&deg;, I had also observed that several birds
of the same kind annually visited that Province from the north. I had
seen the Psittacus Novae Hollandiae and the shell paroquet following
the shoreline of St. Vincent's Gulf like flights of starlings in
England. The different flights at intervals of more than a quarter of
an hour, all came from the north, and followed in one and the same
direction.</p>

<p>"Now although the casual appearance of a few strange birds should
not influence the judgement, yet from the regular migrations of the
feathered race, a reasonable inference may be drawn. Seeing then that
these two lines (viz., from Fort Bourke about lat. 30&deg; and long.
144&deg; to the W.N.W., and from Mount Arden in lat. 35&deg; long.
138&deg; to the north) if prolonged would meet a little to the
northward of the tropic, I formed the following conclusions:</p>

<p>"First, that the birds migrating on those lines would rest for a
time at a point where those lines met.</p>

<p>"Secondly, that the country to which they went would resemble that
which they had left, that birds which frequented rich valleys or high
hills would not settle down in deserts and flat country.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, that the intervening country, whether owing to deserts or
large sheets of water, was not such as these birds could inhabit.
Indeed, such large migrations from different parts to one particular,
argued no less strongly the existence of deserts or of sea to a certain
distance, than the probable richness of the country, to which as to a
common goal these migrations tended.</p>

<p>"On the late expedition, at the Depot in lat. 29-1/2&deg; and long.
142&deg;, I found myself in the direct line of migration to the
north-west; and to that point of the compass, birds whom I knew to
visit Van Diemen's Land would, after watering, pass on. Cockatoos,
after a few hours' rest, would wing their way to the north-west, as
also would various water-birds, as well as pigeons, parrots, and
paroquets, pursued by birds of the Accipitrine class. From these
indications I was led to look still more for the realization of my
hopes, if I could but force my way to the necessary distance.</p>

<p>"I ran 170 miles without crossing a single water-course. I travelled
over salsolaceous plains, crossed sand-ridges, was turned from my
westward course by salt-water lakes; and at last, on October 19th, at
about 80 miles to the east of my former track, I found myself on the
brink of the Stony Desert. Coming suddenly on it I almost lost my
breath. If anything, it looked more forbidding than before. Herbless
and treeless, it filled more than half of the horizon. Not an object
was visible on which to steer, yet we held on our course by compass
like a ship at sea.</p>

<p>"Poor Browne was in excruciating pain from scurvy. Every day I
expected to find him unable to stir. My men were ill from exposure,
scanty food, and muddy water; my horses leg-weary and reduced to
skeletons. I alone stood unscathed, but I could not bear to leave my
companion in that heartless desert.</p>

<p>"Finding myself baffled to the north and to the west, seeing no hope
of rain, realizing that my retreat was too probably already cut off, I
reluctantly turned back to the depot, 443 miles distant, and only
through the help of Providence did we at length reach it."</p>

<p>Sturt, as he mounted to begin his retreat, was nearly induced to
turn again by "a flock of paroquets that flew shrieking from the north
towards Eyre's Creek. They proved that to the last we had followed with
unerring precision the line of migration."</p>

<p align="center">SCOPE AND RESULTS OF CENTRAL EXPEDITION AS SUMMED UP
BY STURT</p>

<p>My instructions directed me to gain the meridian of Mount Arden or
that of 138&deg;, with a view to determine whether there were any chain
of mountains connected with the high lands seen by Mr. Eyre to the
westward of Lake Torrens, and running into the interior from south-west
to north-east. I was ordered to push to the westward and to make the
south the constant base of my operations. I was prohibited from
descending to the north-coast, but it was left optional with me to fall
back on Moreton Bay if I should be forced to the eastward. Whether I
performed the task thus assigned to me or wavered in the accomplishment
of it; whether I fell short of my duty, or yielded only to insuperable
difficulties, the world will be enabled to judge. That I found no fine
country is to be regretted; however, I was not sent to find a fine
country, but to solve a geographical problem. I trust I am not
presumptuous in saying that, from a geographical point of view, the
results of this expedition have been complete. If I did not gain the
heart of the continent, no one will refuse me the credit of having
taken a direct course for it. My distance from that hitherto mysterious
spot was less than 150 miles. In ten days I should have reached the
goal; and that task would have been accomplished had rain fallen when I
was at my farthest north. Had I found such a river as the Victoria, I
would have clung to it to the last; but those alone will really know
the nature of the country who shall follow me into it When I determined
on turning homewards, with mind depressed and strength weakened, it
appeared to me that I had done all that man could do. Now, under the
influence of restored health, I feel that I did far too little. I can
only say that I would not hesitate again to plunge into those dreary
regions, that I might be the first to place my foot in the centre of
this vast territory, and finally to raise the veil which still shrouds
its features, even though, like those of the veiled prophet, they
should wither the beholder.</p>

Exploring Expedition, 1861. Published in the <i>Argus</i>, pp. 2-5,

<blockquote>
<p>In the year 1860 an expedition was planned to travel from Melbourne
to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The leader was Robert Burke, and though
with Wills, Gray, and King he reached the Gulf, the return was fatal
owing to the desertion of the Cooper's Creek Depot by the other members
of the expedition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the course of his evidence before the Commission of Inquiry Mr.
King, the sole survivor, said:</p>

<p>The day before we arrived at Cooper's Creek we were allowed to
consume as much provisions as we chose, in expectations of finding
supplies so soon. We had only one pound of dry meat when we got there.
If we had found no provisions there, we should all have died. It was as
much as any of us could do to travel along the side of the creek. We
had been so weak, that for ten days before, we had scarcely been able
to make much distance, or to walk about. I seemed to be worse than
either Mr. Burke or Mr. Wills, but after we arrived at the Depot I
improved much more than they did. We had no difficulty in finding the
provisions there. We arrived in the moonlight at half-past seven
o'clock at night, after having pushed on thirty miles that day. Mr.
Burke rode on one of the camels, and I and Mr. Wills on the other. We
had our revolvers with us, and had been continually shooting at the
crows and hawks. When we got to the Depot Mr. Burke was a little ahead
of Mr. Wills and myself. He had often before said, "I think I can see
their tents ahead," and made several remarks like that until we arrived
there. When we got near, he said, "I suppose they have shifted to some
other part of the creek." It was Mr. Wills who first saw the tree-mark,
and saw the things scattered about the stockade. He saw the words, "Dig
three feet to the north-east," or north-west; I am not certain which.
When he saw the date at which they came to the camp, and the date at
which they left, he said at once, "They have left here to-day. If they
had shifted to any other part of the creek, they would not have marked
this." We set to work digging up the plant. We did not know where they
had gone to, but thought they had left some instructions. Mr. Burke was
too much excited to do anything, and Mr. Wills and myself dug up the
plant. I got the bottle there and Mr. Burke said: "Whatever
instructions they have left are in this bottle." I then opened it and
handed it to him. When he had read it, he informed us that the other
party, except Paton, and that the animals were in good working order,
and that on account of no person coming up to them, they had made a
start for Camp 60, taking a course S.E. for Bulloo. Mr. Burke then said
it was madness to attempt to follow them, as their men were in good
order, and their camel too. He said we could not expect to make forced
marches, and catch them up. Had the latter said they were in a weak
state, as it appeared they were, we should have tried at any rate to
overtake them. We remained at the creek a few days, and Mr. Burke and
Mr. Wills had a consultation as to what was best to be done.</p>

<p>We left no provisions behind us, but took everything with us. When
we had consumed all the sugar but 12 lb. we gave some balls of it to
the camel. For a few days our principal food was porridge, which we
preferred to anything else. We boiled it with water and sugar. In going
down towards Mount Hopeless, we found we could not carry all the things
we brought with us. We had to leave the camel-pads and such things. We
made two attempts to get to Mount Hopeless. After losing one camel we
remained at the creek some short time, till we recovered strength to
start for Cooper's Creek again. We had only the clothes we stood in,
and no bed-clothing but the camels' pads and two oilcloths. We had
boots and trousers, such as they were.</p>

<p align="center">BURKE'S LAST LETTER</p>

<p>The following is the despatch of Mr. Burke, left at the Depot at
Cooper's Creek:</p>

<p>Depot No. 2, Cooper's Creek, Camp No. 65.&mdash;The return party
from Carpentaria, consisting of myself, Wills and King (Gray dead)
arrived here last night, and found that the depot party had only
started on the same day. We proceed on to-morrow slowly down the creek
towards Adelaide by Mount Hopeless, and shall endeavour to follow
Gregory's track; but we are very weak. The two camels are done up, and
we shall not be able travel faster than four or five miles a day. Gray
died on the road from exhaustion and fatigue. We have all suffered much
from hunger. The provisions left here will, I think, restore our
strength. We have discovered a practicable route to Carpentaria, the
chief portion of which lies on the 140th decree of east longitude.
There is some good country between this and the Stony Desert. From
there to the tropic the country is dry and stony. Between the tropic
and Carpentaria a considerable portion is rangy, but it is well watered
and richly grassed. We reached the shores of Carpentaria on 11th
February, 1861. Greatly disappointed at finding the party here
gone.</p>

<p align="center">(Signed) ROBERT O'HARA BURKE, Leader.</p>

<p align="center">April 22nd, 1861.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The camels cannot travel, and we cannot walk, or we
should follow the other party. We shall move very slowly down the
creek.</p>

<p align="center">KING'S NARRATIVE</p>

<p>Mr. Burke requested Mr. Wills to go up the creek as far as the
Depot, and to place a note in the plant there, stating that we were
then living on the creek, the former note having stated that we were on
our road to South Australia. He also was to bury there the field-books
of the journey to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Mr. Wills being returned, it was decided to go up the creek and live
with the natives, if possible, as Mr. Wills thought we should have but
little difficulty in obtaining provisions from them if we camped on the
opposite side of the creek to them. He said he knew where they had
gone, so we packed up and started. Coming to the gunyahs where we
expected to have found them, we were disappointed, and seeing a nardoo
field close by, halted, intending to make it our camp. For some time we
were employed gathering nardoo, and laying up a supply.</p>

<p>Mr. Wills and I used to collect and carry home a bag each day, and
Mr. Burke generally pounded sufficient for our dinner during our
absence, but Mr. Wills found himself getting very weak, and was shortly
unable to go out to gather nardoo as before, nor even strong enough to
pound it, so that in a few days he became almost helpless. Mr. Burke
now proposed that I should gather as much nardoo as possible in three
days, and that with this supply we should go in search of the
natives&mdash;a plan which had been urged upon us by Mr. Wills as the
only chance of saving him and ourselves as well, as he clearly saw that
I was no longer able to collect sufficient for our wants. Having
collected the seed, as proposed, and having pounded sufficient to last
Mr. Wills for eight days, and two days for ourselves, we placed water
and firewood within his reach and started. Before leaving him, however,
Mr. Burke asked him whether he still wished it, as under no other
circumstances would he leave him; and Mr. Wills again said that he
looked on it as our only chance. He then gave Mr. Burke a letter and
his watch for his father, and we buried the remainder of the
field-books near the gunyah.</p>

<p>In travelling the first day, Mr. Burke seemed very weak and
complained of great pain in his legs and back. On the second day he
seemed to be better, and said that he thought he was getting stronger,
but, on starting, did not go two miles before he said he could go no
further. I persisted in his trying to go on, and managed to get him
along several times, until I saw that he was almost knocked up, when he
said he could not carry his swag, and threw all he had away. I also
reduced mine, taking nothing but a gun and some powder and shot and a
small pouch and some matches. On starting again we did not go far
before Mr. Burke said we should halt for the night, but, as the place
was close to a large sheet of water, and exposed to the wind, I
prevailed to go a little further, to the next reach of water where we
camped.</p>

<p>We searched about and found a few small patches of nardoo, which I
collected and pounded, and with a crow, which I shot, made a good
evening's meal. From the time we halted, Mr. Burke seemed to be getting
worse, although he ate his supper. He said he felt convinced he could
not last many hours, and gave me his watch, which, he said, belonged to
the Committee; and a pocket-book, to give to Sir William Stawell, and
in which he wrote some notes. He then said to me: "I hope you will
remain with me here till I am quite dead&mdash;it is a comfort to know
that some one is by; but when I am dying, it is my wish that you should
place the pistol in my right hand, and that you leave me unburied as I
lie." That night he spoke very little, and the following morning I
found him speechless, or nearly so; and about eight o'clock he expired.
I remained a few hours there, but as I saw there was no use in
remaining longer, I went up the creek in search of the natives. I felt
very lonely, and at night usually slept in deserted wurleys, belonging
to the natives. Two days after leaving the spot where Mr. Burke died, I
found some gunyahs, where the natives had deposited a bag of nardoo,
sufficient to last me a fortnight, and three bundles containing various
articles. I also shot a crow that evening, but was in great dread that
the natives would come and deprive me of the nardoo.</p>

<p>I remained there two days to recover my strength, and then returned
to Mr. Wills. I took back three crows; but found him lying dead in his
gunyah, and the natives had been there and had taken away some of his
clothes. I buried the corpse with sand, and remained some days; but
finding that my stock of nardoo was running short, and being unable to
gather it, I tracked the natives who had been to the camp by their
foot-prints in the sand, and went some distance down the creek,
shooting crows and hawks on the road. The natives hearing the report of
the gun, came to meet me, and took me with them to their camp, giving
me nardoo and fish. They took the birds I had shot and cooked them for
me, and afterwards showed me a gunyah, where I was to sleep with three
of the single men.</p>

<p>They appeared to feel great compassion for me when they understood
that I was alone on the creek, and gave me plenty to eat. After being
four days with them, I saw that they were becoming tired of me, and
they made signs that they were going up the creek, and that I had
better go downwards; but I pretended not to understand them. The same
day they shifted camp, and I followed them; and on reaching their camp,
I shot some crows, which pleased them so much that they made me a
breakwind in the centre of their camp, and came and sat round me until
such time as the crows were cooked, when they assisted me to eat them.
The same day one of the women to whom I had given part of a crow, came
and gave me a ball of nardoo, saying that she would give me more only
she had such a sore arm that she was unable to pound. She showed me a
sore on her arm, and the thought struck me that I would boil some water
in the billy and wash her arm with a sponge. During the operation the
whole tribe sat round and were muttering one to another. Her husband
sat down by her side and she was crying all the time. After I had
washed it, I touched it with some nitrate of silver, when she began to
yell and ran off, crying out, "Mokow! Mokow!" ("Fire! fire!"). From
this time, she and her husband used to give me a small quantity of
nardoo both night and morning, and whenever the tribe were about going
on a fishing excursion, he used to give me notice to go with them. They
also used to assist me in making a wurley, or breakwind, whenever they
shifted camp. I generally shot a crow or a hawk, and gave it to them in
return for these little services.</p>

<p>From this time to when the relief party arrived&mdash;a period of
about a month&mdash;they treated me with uniform kindness, and looked
upon me as one of themselves. The day on which I was released, one of
the tribe who had been fishing came and told me that the white fellows
were coming, and the whole of the tribe who were then in camp sallied
out in every direction to meet the party, while the man who had brought
the news took me over the creek, where I shortly saw the party coming
down.</p>

<p align="center">THE CENTRE</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 22nd April.</i> Small Gum Creek, under Mount Stuart,
Centre of Australia. To-day I find from my observations of the sun,
111&deg; 00' 30", that I am now camped in the centre of Australia. I
have marked a tree and planted the British Flag there. There is a high
mount about two miles and a half to the N.N.E. I wish it had been in
the centre; but on it to-morrow, I will raise a cone of stones, and
plant the flag there, and name it "Central Mount Stuart." We have been
in search of permanent water to-day, but cannot find any. I hope from
the top of Central Mount Stuart to find something good to the N.W.
Examined a large creek; can find no surface water, but got some by
scratching in the sand. It is a large creek divided into many channels,
but they are all filled with sand; splendid grass all round this
camp.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 23rd April.</i> Centre. Took Kekwick and the flag, and
went to the top of the Mount, but found it to be much higher and more
difficult of ascent than I anticipated. After a deal of labour, slips
and knocks, we at last arrived on the top. The view to the north is
over a large plain of gums, mulga, and spinifex, with watercourses
running through it. The large gum creek that we crossed winds round
this hill in a N.E. direction; at about ten miles it is joined by
another. After joining they take a course more north, and I lost sight
of them in the far distant plain. To the N.N.E. is the termination of
the hills; to the N.E., E. and S.E. are broken ranges, and to the
N.N.W. the ranges on the west side of the plain terminate. To the N.W.
are broken ranges; and to the W. is a very high peak, between which,
and this place to the S.W. are a number of isolated hills. Built a
large cone of stones, in the centre of which I placed a pole with the
British flag nailed to it. Near the top of the cone I placed a small
bottle, in which there is a slip of paper, with our signatures to it,
stating by whom it was raised. We then gave three hearty cheers for the
flag, the emblem of civil and religious liberty, and may it be a sign
to the natives that the dawn of liberty, civilization, and Christianity
is about to break upon them. We can see no water from the top.
Descended, but did not reach the camp till after dark. This water still
continues which makes me think there must certainly be more higher up.
I have named the range "John Range," after my friend and well-wisher,
John Chambers, Esq., brother to James Chambers, Esq., one of the
promoters of this expedition.</p>

<p align="center">ACROSS AT LAST</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 24th July.</i> Thring Creek, entering the Marsh.
Started at 7.40, course north. I have taken this course in order to
make the sea-coast, which I suppose to be distant about eight miles and
a half, as soon as possible; by this I hope to avoid the marsh. I shall
travel along the beach to the north of the Adelaide. I did not inform
any of the party except Thring and Auld, that I was so near to the sea,
as I wished to give them a surprise on reaching it. Proceeded through a
light soil, slightly elevated with a little ironstone on the surface,
the volcanic rock cropping out occasionally; also some flats of black
alluvial soil. The timber much smaller and more like scrub, showing
that we are nearing the sea.</p>

<p>At eight miles and a half came upon a broad valley of black alluvial
soil, covered with long grass; from this I can hear the wash of the
sea. On the other side of the valley, which is rather more than a
quarter of a mile wide, is growing a line of thick heavy bushes, very
dense, showing that to be the boundary of the beach. Crossed the valley
and entered the scrub, which was a complete network of vines. Stopped
the horses to clear a way, whilst I advanced a few yards on to the
beach, and was gratified and delighted to behold the water of the
Indian Ocean in Van Diemen's Gulf, before the party with the horses
knew anything of its proximity. Thring, who rode in advance of me,
called out "The Sea!" which so took them all by surprise, and they were
so astonished that he had to repeat the call before they fully
understood what was meant. Then they immediately gave three long and
hearty cheers. The beach is covered with a soft blue mud. It being ebb
tide, I could see some distance; found it would be impossible for me to
take the horses along it; I therefore kept them where I had halted
them, and allowed half the party to come on to the beach and gratify
themselves by a sight of the sea, while the other half remained to
watch the horses until their return. I dipped my feet, and washed my
face and hands in the sea, as I promised the late Governor, Sir Richard
McDonnell, I would do if I reached it. The mud has nearly covered all
the shells; we got a few, however. I could see no seaweed. There is a
point of land some distance off, bearing 70&deg;. After all the party
had had some time on the beach, at which they were much pleased and
gratified, they collected a few shells; I returned to the valley, where
I had my initials (J.M.D.S.) cut on a large tree, as I did not intend,
until I arrived at the mouth of the Adelaide, to put up my flag.
Proceeded along the valley; at one mile and a half coming upon a small
creek, with running water, and the valley being covered with beautiful
green grass, I have camped to give the horses the benefit of it. Thus
have I, through the instrumentality of Divine Providence, been led to
accomplish the great object of the expedition, and take the whole party
safely as witnesses to the fact, and through one of the finest
countries man could wish to behold, good to the coast and with a stream
of water within half a mile of the sea. From Newcastle water to the
sea-beach, the main body of the horses have been only one night without
water and then got it within the next day. If this country is settled,
it will be one of the finest colonies under the Crown, suitable for the
growth of any and everything&mdash;what a splendid country for
producing cotton! Judging from the number of the pathways from the
water to the beach, across the valley, the natives must be very
numerous; we have not seen any, although we have passed many of their
recent tracks and encampments. The cabbage and fan palm-trees have been
very plentiful during to-day's journey down to this valley. This creek
I named "Charles Creek," after the eldest son of John Chambers, Esq.;
it is one by which some large bodies of springs discharge their surplus
water into Van Diemen's Gulf; its banks are of soft mud, and boggy.
Wind, south. Latitude, 12&deg; 13&acute; 30".</p>

<p><i>Friday, 25th July.</i> Charles Creek, Van Diemen's Gulf. I have
sent Thring to the south-west to see if he can get round the marsh. If
it is firm ground I shall endeavour to make the mouth of the river by
that way. After a long search he has returned, and informs me that it
is impracticable, being too boggy for the horses. As the great object
of this expedition is now attained, and the mouth of the river already
well known, I do not think it advisable to waste the strength of my
horses in forcing them through, neither do I see what object I should
gain by doing so; they have still a very long and fatiguing journey in
recrossing the continent to Adelaide, and my health is so bad that I am
unable to bear a long day's ride. I shall, therefore, cross this creek
and see if I can get along by the sea-beach, or close to it. Started
and had great difficulty in getting the horses over, though we cut a
large quantity of grass, putting it on the banks and on logs of wood
which were put into it. We had a number bogged, and I was nearly losing
one of my best horses, and was obliged to have him pulled out with
ropes; after the loss of some time we succeeded in getting them all
over safely. At two miles came upon an open part of the beach, went on
to it, and again found the mud quite impassable for horses. Stopped the
party, as this travelling is too much for the horses, and, taking
Thring with me, rode two miles to see if the ground was any firmer in
places; found it very soft where the salt water had covered it, in
others not so bad. Judging from the number of the shells banked up in
different places, the sea must occasionally come over this. I saw at
once that this would not do for the weak state in which my horses were,
and I therefore returned to where I left the party, resolving to
re-cross the continent to the City of Adelaide. I now had an open place
cleared, and selecting one of the tallest trees, stripped it of its
lower branches, and on its highest branch fixed my flag, the Union
Jack, with my name sewn in the centre of it. When this was completed,
the party gave three cheers, and Mr. Kekwick then addressed me,
congratulating me on having completed this great and important
undertaking, to which I replied. Mr. Waterhouse also spoke a few words
on the same subject, and concluded with three cheers for the Queen, and
three for the Prince of Wales. At one foot south from the foot of the
tree is buried, about eight inches below the ground, an air-tight tin
case, in which is a paper with the following notice:</p>

<p>"South Australian Great Northern Exploring Expedition. The exploring
party, under the command of John McDouall Stuart arrived at this spot
on the 25th day of July, 1862, having crossed the entire continent of
Australia from the Southern to the Indian Ocean, passing through the
centre. They left the City of Adelaide on the 26th day of October 1861,
and the most northern station of the colony on 21st day of January,
1862. To commemorate this happy event, they have raised this flag
bearing his name. All well. God Save the Queen!"</p>

<p>(Here follow the signatures of myself and party.)</p>

<p>As this bay has not been named, I have taken this opportunity of
naming it "Chambers Bay," in honour of Miss Chambers, who kindly
presented me with the flag which I have planted this day, and I hope
this may be the first sign of the dawn of approaching civilization.</p>

<p>Exactly this day nine months the party left North Adelaide. Before
leaving, between the hours of eleven and twelve o'clock, they had lunch
at Mr. Chambers' house; John Bentham Neals, Esq., being present,
proposed success to me, and wished I might plant the flag on the
north-west coast. At the same hour of the day, nine months after, the
nag was raised on the shores of Chambers Bay, Van Diemen Gulf. (On the
bark of the tree on which the flag is placed is cut&mdash;DIG ONE FOOT,
S.) We then bade farewell to the Indian Ocean, and returned to Charles
Creek, where we had again great difficulty in getting the horses
across, but it was at last accomplished without accident. We have
passed numerous and recent tracks of natives to-day; they are still
burning the country at some distance from the coast.</p>

<p>[<i>Note.</i> The memorandum left by Stuart on top of the Central
Mountain runs as follows:]</p>

<p>John McDouall Stuart and party consisting of two men and himself
arrived from Adelaide in the Centre of Australia on Saturday evening
the twenty first day of April 1860, and have built this cone of stones
and raised this flag to commemorate the event, on top of Mount Sturt;
the centre is about two miles South South West at a small gum creek
where there is a tree marked facing the south.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We started from Perth on the afternoon of Wednesday, the 30th of
March 1870. His Excellency the Governor accompanied us for about three
miles on the Albany Road. We had fifteen horses, and provisions
sufficient for the journey to Esperance Bay, a distance of about 450
miles, where it was arranged further supplies would await us.</p>

<p><i>May 18th.</i> Esperance Bay. After starting the party went in
advance with Billy to prepare camp at Israelite Bay. When we reached
it, were delighted to find the <i>Adur</i> lying safely at anchor
there; proceeding on board found all well. Procured abundance of water
by digging one foot deep in the sand-hills, and good feed a short
distance from camp.</p>

<p>Our friends on the <i>Adur</i> were looking anxiously for us. We
were two days behind the appointed time, and they feared some evil had
befallen us, not taking into consideration the many delays incidental
to such a journey through strange and difficult country as we had
made.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May we determined to celebrate the Queen's birthday.
All hands from the <i>Adur</i> came ashore, and I drew them up in line
under the Union Jack, which was duly hoisted near the camp. We
presented arms; sang "God Save the Queen" vigorously, and fired a
salute of twenty-one guns, finishing with three cheers. I venture to
record that our vocal efforts were as sincerely and heartily made in
the Australian wilderness as any which rang that day in any part of Her
Majesty's wide dominions. We were all highly delighted&mdash;not only
feeling that we had done our duty as loyal subjects, but other
celebrations in more civilized places were forcibly recalled to
memory.</p>

<p><i>June 22nd.</i> Saddled up at dawn, and steering southerly over
clear, open grassy plains for twenty-eight miles, we reached the
cliffs, and rested an hour; after which we continued our journey and
reached camp a little after dark, finding all well.</p>

<p><i>June 23rd.</i> Made preparations for a start for Eucla to-morrow,
and put everything in travelling order. During my absence, Osborn had
got the horses' feet in order, and the pack-saddles had been overhauled
and repairs generally made. In looking round the camp, Tommy Windich
found shoulder-blade of a horse and two small pieces of leather. They
no doubt belonged to Mr. Eyre's equipment, and, on reference to his
journal, I find he was here obliged to kill a horse for food.</p>

<p>I cut off part of the shoulder-blade, and have since given it,
together with the pieces of leather, to His Excellency Governor
Weld.</p>

<p><i>June 24th.</i> Started at 8.30 a.m. <i>en route</i> for Eucla.
Steering in a N.N.E. direction for fifteen miles, reached the cliffs,
and after following along them two miles, found a large rock
water-hole, but in an almost inaccessible spot. While I was examining
the cliffs near, to find a place where we could get the horses up,
Tommy heard a coo-ey, and after answering it a good many times, we were
surprised to see two natives walking up towards us, unarmed. I
approached and met them; they did not appear at all frightened and at
once began to eat the damper I gave them. We could not understand
anything they said. I beckoned them to come along with us, which they
at once did, and followed so closely after as to tramp on my spurs.
They pointed to water further ahead. After walking about a mile, four
more natives were seen running after us, who, on joining, made a great
noise, singing and appearing very pleased. Shortly afterwards two more
followed, making seven in all; all entirely naked. We found the water
alluded to, on the top of the cliffs, but it being too late to get the
horses up, we turned off to the southward half a mile, and camped on a
small grassy flat, without water for the horses. The seven natives
slept at our fire. We gave them as much damper as they could eat. They
had not the least particle of clothing, and made pillows of each
other's bodies, and resembled pigs more than human beings.</p>

<p><i>July 1st.</i> Descending the cliffs with difficulty, we followed
along the foot of them, which was beautifully grassed, and, after
travelling twelve miles, beheld the Eucla sand-hills. On my pointing
them out, every heart was full of joy, and, being away some distance, I
heard the long and continued hurrahs from the party! Eucla was all the
conversation! I never before remember witnessing such joy as was
evinced on this occasion by all the party. After travelling five miles
further, we camped close to the cliffs at a small water-hole. We might
have reached Eucla this evening, but I preferred doing so to-morrow,
when we could have the day before us to choose camp. We are now again
in safety, Eucla being only seven miles distant; after having travelled
166 miles without finding permanent water&mdash;in fact, over 300 miles
with only one place where we procured permanent water. I trust we all
recognized with sincerity and thankfulness the guiding and protecting
Father who had brought us through in safety.</p>

<p><i>July 2nd.</i> Made an early start and steered straight for the
anchorage, distant about five miles, having first ascended the range to
have a view of the country, which was very extensive. Far as the eye
could reach to the westward, the Roe Plains and Hampton Range were
visible; while to the eastward lay Wilson's Bluff and the Delissier
sand-hills; and three miles west of them we were delighted to behold
the good schooner <i>Adur</i>, riding safely at anchor in Eucla
harbour, which formed by no means the least pleasing feature of the
scene to our little band of weary travellers. Made at once for the
vessel, and on reaching her, found all well and glad to see us. She was
anchored between the Red and Black Beacons. The latter had been blown
down, but shall be re-erected. There being no water at the anchorage,
moved on to the Delissier sand-hills, where we found water by digging
two and a half feet from the surface. Camped on the west side of the
sand-hills.</p>

<p>Landed barley, etc., from the boat. There was a good feed for the
horses under the Hampton Range, about a mile and a half distant.</p>

<p><i>July 11th.</i> Osborn busy with the shoeing. Went with Billy to
Wilson's Bluff, and saw the boundary-post between South and Western
Australia, placed by Lieutenant Douglas.</p>

<p><i>July 12th.</i> Erected the flagstaff with the Union Jack flying,
and nailed a copperplate to the staff, with the following engraved on
it:</p>

<p align="center">WESTERN AUSTRALIA. ERECTED BY J. FORREST,<br>
JULY 12TH, 1870.</p>

<p><i>July 17th.</i> Was obliged to get up twice to bring back the
horses, and at 4 o'clock made a start. The horses were in a very
exhausted state; some having difficulty to keep up. About noon I could
descry the land turning to the southward, and saw, with great pleasure,
we were fast approaching the Head of the Great Australian Bight.
Reached the sand-patches at the extreme head of the Bight just as the
sun was setting, and found abundance of water by digging two feet deep
in the sand. Gave the horses as much as I considered safe for them to
have at one time. I have never seen horses in such a state before and
hope never to do so again. The horses, which four days ago were strong
and in good condition, now appeared only skeletons, eyes sunk, nostrils
dilated, and thoroughly exhausted. Since leaving Eucla to getting water
at this spot, a period of nearly ninety hours, they had only been
allowed one gallon of water each, which was given them from our
water-drums. It is wonderful how well they performed this journey; had
they not started in good condition they never could have done it. We
all felt very tired. During the last sixty hours I have only had about
five hours' sleep, and have been continually in a state of
anxiety&mdash;besides which, all have had to walk a great deal.</p>

<p><i>July 18th.</i> This is a great day in my journal and journey.
After collecting the horses we followed along the beach half a mile,
when I struck N. for Peelunabie Well, and at half a mile struck a cart
track from Fowler's Bay to Peelunabie. After following it one mile and
a quarter, came to the well, and old sheep yards, and camped. Found
better water in the sand-hills than in the well. There is a board
nailed on a pole directing to the best water, with the following
engraved on it: "G. Mackie, April 5th, 1865, water&mdash;120 yards."
Upon sighting the road this morning, which I had told them we should
do, a loud and continued hurrahing came from all the party, who were
overjoyed to find signs of civilization again; while Billy, who was in
advance with me, and whom I had told to look out, as he would see a
road directly, which he immediately did, began giving me great praise
for bringing them safely through a long journey. I certainly felt very
pleased and relieved from anxiety, and, on reviewing the long line of
march we had performed through an uncivilized country, was very
sensible of that protecting Providence which had guided us safely
through the undertaking.</p>

<p>Before I conclude I have the pleasing duty to record my entire
appreciation of every member of the party. I need not particularize as
one and all had the interest and welfare of the expedition at heart,
and on no occasion uttered a single murmur. Finally, sir, my best and
most sincere thanks are due to His Excellency Governor Weld for the
very efficient manner in which the expedition was equipped. It is
chiefly owing to the great zeal and desire of His Excellency that I
should have everything necessary, that the success of the enterprise is
attributable.</p>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Explorations in Australia (John Forrest, 1875),
pp. 149-162, 188, 201, 257, 261</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Four years after his successful journey along the Bight, Forrest
determined to explore the interior of Western Australia, and in so
doing added greatly to the knowledge of that somewhat neglected
State.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The success which had attended my previous expeditions, and the
great encouragement received from the Government and public of each
colony, made me wish to undertake another journey for the purpose of
ascertaining whether a route from Western Australia to the advanced
settlements of the Southern colony was practicable. I also hoped to
contribute, if possible, towards the solution of the problem, What is
the nature of the Interior? My first journey, when I succeeded in
penetrating for about 600 miles into the unknown desert of Central
Australia, had convinced me that, although there might, and doubtless
would, be considerable difficulties to be encountered, there were no
insuperable obstacles, except a probable failure in the supply of
water. That certainly was the most formidable of all the difficulties
that would no doubt have to be encountered; but on the previous journey
the scarcity of water had been endured, not without privation and
suffering, but without any very serious result.</p>

<p>Stuart's great feat of crossing the continent from south to north
had been followed by other successful efforts in the same direction.
Another result was the establishing a line of telegraph from Adelaide
to Port Darwin. This might, therefore, be considered the eastern
boundary of the unknown districts, and, moreover, was the point of
departure for the South Australian expeditions in a westerly direction.
It was also the limit I desired to reach, and reaching it, I should
achieve the object I had so much at heart.</p>

<p>On the 18th of March, 1874, the expedition quitted Perth. The 19th
was Sunday, and, according to practice, we rested. Every Sunday
throughout the journey I read Divine Service, and, except making the
daily observations, only work absolutely necessary was done. Whenever
possible, we rested on Sunday, taking, if we could, a pigeon, a parrot,
or other such game as might come in our way as special fare. Sunday's
dinner was an institution for which, even in those inhospitable wilds,
we had a great respect.</p>

<p><i>June 13th.</i> About one o'clock Pierre saw a flock of emus
coming to water, and went off to get a shot. Kennedy followed with the
rifle. I climbed up on a small tree to watch them. I was surprised to
hear natives' voices, and, looking towards the hills, I saw from forty
to sixty natives running towards the camp, all plumed up and armed with
spears and shields. I was cool, and told Sweeny to bring out the
revolvers; descended from the tree and got my gun, and coo-ed to Pierre
and Kennedy, who came running. By this time they were within sixty
yards, and halted. One advanced to meet me, and stood twenty yards off:
I made friendly signs; he did not appear very hostile. All at once, one
from behind (probably a chief) came rushing forward, and made many
feints to throw spears. He went through many manoeuvres, and gave a
signal, when the whole number made a rush towards us, yelling and
shouting, with their spears shipped. When within thirty yards, I gave
the word to fire; we all fired as one man, only one report being heard.
I think the natives got a few shots, but they all ran up the hill and
there stood talking and haranguing and appearing very angry. We
re-loaded our guns, and got everything ready for a second attack, which
I was sure they would make. We were not long left in suspense. They all
descended from the hill and came on slowly towards us. When they were
about 150 yards off I fired my rifle, and we saw one of them fall, but
he got up again and was assisted away. On examining the spot we found
the ball had cut in two the two spears he was carrying; he also dropped
his wommera, which was covered with blood. We could follow the
blood-drops a long way over the stones. I am afraid he got a severe
wound. My brother and Windich being away we were short-handed. The
natives seem determined to take our lives and, therefore, I shall not
hesitate to fire on them should they attack us again. I thus decide,
and write in all humility, considering it a necessity, as the only way
of saving our lives. I write this at 4 p.m., just after the occurrence,
so that, should anything happen to us, my brother will know how and
when it occurred. 5 p.m.&mdash;The natives appear to have made off. We
intend sleeping in the thicket close to camp, and keeping a strict
watch, so as to be ready for them should they return to the attack this
evening. At 7.30 my brother and Windich returned, and were surprised to
hear of our adventure. They had been over fifty miles from camp E.S.E.,
and had passed over some good feeding country, but had not found a drop
of water. They and their horses had been over thirty hours without
water.</p>

<p><i>June 14th, Sunday.</i> The natives did not return to the attack
last night. In looking round camp we found the traces of blood where
one of the natives had been lying down. This must have been the
foremost man, who was in the act of throwing his spear, and who urged
the others on. Two therefore, at least, are wounded, and will have
cause to remember the time they made their murderous attack upon us. We
worked all day putting up a stone hut, ten by nine feet, and seven feet
high, thatched with boughs. We finished it; it will make us safe at
night. Being a very fair hut, it will be a great source of defence.
Barometer 28.09; thermometer 68&deg; at 5 p.m. Hope to have rain, as
without it we cannot proceed.</p>

<p><i>July 3rd.</i> Soon after starting, found a little water in a
gully and gave our horses a drink. Ascended a spur of the range and had
a good view ahead, and was very pleased with the prospect. Steering
N.E. towards a large range about fifteen miles off, we found a great
deal of spinnifex, although the country generally was thickly wooded. I
rode Mission, who went along pretty well for about twelve miles, when
Williams gave in again, and Mission soon did the same. For the next six
miles to the range we had awful work, but managed with leading and
driving to reach the range; spinnifex all the way and also on the top
of it. I was very nearly knocked up myself, but ascended the range and
had a very extensive view. Far to the N. and E. the horizon was as
level and uniform as that of the sea; apparently spinnifex everywhere;
no hills or ranges could be seen for a distance of quite thirty
miles.</p>

<p>The prospect was very cheerless and disheartening. Windich went on
the only horse not knocked up in order to find water for the horses. I
followed after his tracks, leading the two poor done-up horses. With
difficulty I could get them to walk. Over, and through the rough range
I managed to pull them along and found sufficient water to give them a
good drink, and camped on a small patch of rough grass in one of the
gorges. Spinnifex everywhere; it is a most fearful country. We cannot
proceed farther in this direction, and must return and meet the party,
which I hope to do to-morrow night. We can only crawl along having to
walk and lead the horses, or at least drag them. The party have been
following us, only getting a little water from gullies, and there is
very little to fall back on for over fifty miles. I will leave what I
intend doing until I meet them. I am nearly knocked up again to-night;
my boots have hurt my feet, but I am not yet disheartened.</p>

<p>[Forrest stayed in the Interior for nearly three more months.]</p>

<p><i>Sept. 26th.</i> Got off early and followed the river (Hamilton)
about two miles when it took a bend to the north, and as it was rather
boggy near it, we left it, and steered about east and E.N.E. for about
twenty miles over most miserable country without any grass. We camped
on a small gully with a little water in it, and some old dry grass in a
flat. The horses were very tired, not having had anything to eat for
the last two or three days; and some showed signs of giving in; in
fact, all weak and knocked up, and we had to handle them very
carefully. For the first thirteen miles we passed many clay-pans full
of water&mdash;water nearly everywhere&mdash;after which there was very
little; and the rain does not appear to have been heavy to the east.
The river is about a mile and a half north of us, and we have not seen
it for some miles. Latitude 27&deg; 9' south. Hope to reach the
telegraph line to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 27th, Sunday.</i> Continuing E.N.E. for two miles, came to
the Alberga, and following along its right bank, over many clay-pans
with water, about east for twelve miles, and then E.N.E. for three
miles, and reached the telegraph line, between Adelaide and Port
Darwin, and camped. Long and continued cheers came from our little band
as they beheld at last the goal to which we have been travelling for so
long. I felt rejoiced and relieved from anxiety; and on reflecting on
the long line of travel we had performed through an unknown country,
almost a wilderness, felt very thankful to that good Providence that
had guarded and guided us so safely through it. The telegraph line is
most substantially put up and well wired, and is very creditable at
this spot; large poles of bush timber, often rather crooked, and iron
ones here and there. I now gave up keeping watch, having kept it
regularly for the last six months. Marked a tree F. 104, being 104th
camp from Geraldton.</p>

<p align="center">GOVERNOR PHILLIP'S FIRST COMMISSION</p>

<p align="center">GEORGE R.</p>

<p>George the Third, etc., to our trusty and well-beloved Captain
Arthur Phillip, greeting:</p>

<p>We, reposing especial trust and confidence in your loyalty, courage
and experience in military affairs, do, by these presents, constitute
and appoint you to be Governor of our territory called New South Wales,
extending from the northern cape or extremity of the coast called Cape
York, in the latitude of 10&deg; 37' south, to the southern extremity
of the said territory of New South Wales or South Cape, in the latitude
of 43&deg; 39' south, and of all the country inland to the westward as
far as the one hundred and thirty-fifth degree of longitude reckoning
from the meridian of Greenwich, including all the islands adjacent in
the Pacific Ocean, within the latitude aforesaid of 10&deg; 37' south
and 43&deg; 39' south, and of all towns, garrisons, castles, forts, and
all other fortifications or other military works which now are or may
be hereafter erected upon this said territory. You are therefore
carefully and diligently to discharge the duties of Governor in and
over our said territory by doing and performing all and all manner of
things thereunto belonging, and we do hereby strictly charge and
command all our officers and soldiers who shall be employed within our
said territory, and all others whom it may concern, to obey you as
Governor thereof; and you are to observe and follow such orders and
directions from time to time as you shall receive from us, or any other
your superior officer according to the rules and discipline of war, and
likewise such orders and directions as we shall send you under our
signet or sign manual, or by our High Treasurer or Commissioners of our
Treasury for the time being, or one of our principal Secretaries of
State, in pursuance of the trust we hereby repose in you.</p>

<p>Given at our Court at St. James's the twelfth day of October, 1786,
in the twenty-sixth year of our reign.</p>

<p align="center">By His Majesty's command.</p>

<p class='right'>SYDNEY.</p>

<p align="center">GOVERNOR PHILLIP'S INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p align="center">G.R.</p>

<p>Instructions for our trusty and well-beloved Arthur Phillip, Esq.,
our Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over our territory of
New South Wales and its dependencies or to the Lieutenant Governor or
Commander-in-Chief of the said territory for the time being. Given at
our Court at St. James's the 25th day of April 1787 in the
twenty-seventh year of our reign.</p>

<p>You are to fit yourself with all convenient speed, and to hold
yourself in readiness to repair to your said command, and being
arrived, to take upon you the execution of the trust we have reposed in
you, as soon as conveniently may be, with all due solemnity to cause
our said Commission under our Great Seal of Great Britain constituting
you our Governor and Commander-in-Chief as aforesaid to be read and
published.</p>

<p>And whereas we have ordered that about 600 male and 180 female
convicts now under sentence or order of transportation whose names are
contained in the list hereunto annexed should be removed out of the
gaols and other places of confinement in this our kingdom, and be put
on board of the several transport ships which have been taken up for
their reception, it is our Royal will and pleasure that as soon as the
said convicts, the several persons composing the civil establishments,
and the stores, provisions, etc., provided for their use, shall be put
on board the <i>Supply</i>, tender, and the transport ships named in
the margin, and be in readiness to depart, that you do take them under
your protection and proceed in the <i>Sirius</i> with the said tender
and transports to the Port on the coast of New South Wales, situated in
the latitude of 33&deg; 41' called by the name of Botany Bay, agreeably
to the instructions with which you will be furnished by the
Commissioners of our Admiralty, in pursuance of our Royal commands
already signified to them.</p>

<p>According to the best information which we have obtained, Botany Bay
appears to be the most eligible situation upon the said coast for the
first establishment, possessing a commodious harbour and other
advantages which no part of the coast hitherto discovered affords. It
is therefore our will and pleasure that you do immediately upon your
landing, after taking measures for securing yourself and the people who
accompany you as much as possible from any attacks or interruptions of
the natives of that country, as well as for the preservation and safety
of the public stores, proceed to the cultivation of the land,
distributing the convicts for that purpose in such manner, and under
such Inspectors and Overseers, and under such regulations as may appear
to you to be necessary and best calculated for procuring supplies of
grain and ground provisions.</p>

<p>The assortment of tools and utensils which have been provided for
the use of the convicts and other persons who are to compose the
intended settlement are to be distributed according to your discretion,
and according to the employment assigned to the several persons. In the
distribution, however, you will use every proper degree of economy, and
be careful that the Commissary so transmit an account of the issues
from time to time to the Commissioners of our Treasury to enable them
to judge of the propriety or expediency of granting further supplies.
The clothing of the convicts and the provisions issued to them, and the
several civil and military establishments, must be accounted for in the
same manner.</p>

<p>The increase of the stock of animals must depend entirely upon the
measures you may adopt on the outset for their preservation; and as the
Settlement will be amply supplied with vegetable productions, and most
likely with fish, fresh provisions, excepting for the sick and
convalescents, may in a great degree be dispensed with. For these
reasons it will become you to be extremely cautious in permitting any
cattle, sheep, hogs, etc., intended for propagating the breed of such
animals to be slaughtered until a competent stock maybe acquired, to
admit of your supplying the settlement from it with animal food without
having further recourse to the places from whence such stock may have
originally been obtained.</p>

<p>It is our will and pleasure that the productions of all descriptions
acquired by the labour of the convicts should be considered as a public
stock, which we so far leave to your disposal that such parts thereof
as may be requisite for the subsistence of the said convicts and their
families, or the subsistence of the civil and military establishments
of the settlement may be applied by you to that use. The remainder of
such productions you will reserve as a provision for a further number
of convicts, which you may expect will shortly follow you from hence,
to be employed under your direction in the manner pointed out in these
our instructions to you.</p>

<p>From the natural increase of corn and other vegetable food from a
common industry, after the ground has once been cultivated, as well as
of animals, it cannot be expedient that all the convicts which
accompany you should be employed in attending only to the object of
provisions. And as it has been humbly represented to us that advantages
may be derived from the flax-plant which is found in the islands not
far distant from the intended settlement, not only as a means of
acquiring clothing for the convicts and other persons who may become
settlers, but from its superior excellence for a variety of maritime
purposes, and as it may ultimately become an article of export, it is,
therefore, our will and pleasure that you do particularly attend to its
cultivation, and that you do send home by every opportunity which may
offer, samples of this article, in order that a judgment may be formed
whether it may not be necessary to instruct you further upon this
subject.</p>

<p>And whereas we are desirous that some further information should be
obtained of the several ports or harbours upon the coast, and the
islands contiguous thereto, within the limits of your government, you
are, whenever the <i>Sirius</i> or the <i>Supply</i> tender, can
conveniently be spared, to send one, or both of them, upon that
service.</p>

<p>Norfolk Island, situated in the lat.&mdash;&mdash;, and
long.&mdash;&mdash;[blanks in manuscript] east from Greenwich
about&mdash;&mdash;, being represented as a spot which may hereafter
become useful, you are, as soon as circumstances will admit of it, to
send a small establishment thither to secure the same to us, and
prevent it being occupied by the subjects of any other European power;
and you will cause any remarks or observations which you may obtain in
consequence of this instruction to be transmitted to our Principal
Secretary of State for Plantation Affairs for our information.</p>

<p>You are to endeavour by every possible means to open an intercourse
with the natives and to conciliate their affections, enjoining all our
subjects to live in amity and kindness with them. And if any of our
subjects shall wantonly destroy them, or give them any unnecessary
interruption in the exercise of their several occupations, it is our
will and pleasure that you do cause such offenders to be brought to
punishment according to the degree of the offence. You will endeavour
to procure an account of the numbers inhabiting the neighbourhood of
the intended settlement, and report your opinion to one of our
Secretaries of State in what manner our intercourse with these people
may be turned to the advantage of this colony.</p>

<p>And it is further our royal will and pleasure that you do by all
proper methods enforce a due observance of religion and good order
among the inhabitants of the new settlement, and that you do take such
steps for the due celebration of public worship as circumstances will
permit.</p>

<p>And whereas many of our subjects employed upon military service at
the said settlement and others who may resort thither upon their
private occupations, may hereafter be desirous of proceeding to the
cultivation and improvement of the land, and as we are disposed to
afford them every reasonable encouragement in such an undertaking: It
is our will and pleasure that you do, with all convenient speed,
transmit a report of the actual state and quality of the soil at and
near the said intended settlement, the probable and most effectual
means of improving and cultivating the same, and of the mode, and upon
what terms and conditions, according to the best of your judgment, the
said lands should be granted, that proper instructions and authorities
may be given to you for that purpose.</p>

continent of Australia, Governor Phillip wrote an account of his work

<p align="center">GOVERNOR PHILLIP TO LORD SYDNEY</p>

<p class='right'>Sydney Cove, New South Wales,</p>

<p class='right'><i>May 15th, 1788.</i></p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>I had the honour of informing your Lordship, by Captain Cox, who was
returning to Europe from Madras that I was ready to sail from the Cape
of Good Hope, and which I did, with the ships under my command, the
12th of November. The 25th, being eighty leagues to the eastward of the
Cape, I left the <i>Sirius</i>, and went on board the <i>Supply</i>
tender, in hopes, by leaving the convoy, to gain sufficient time to
examine the country round Botany Bay and fix on the most eligible
situation for the colony before the transports arrived.</p>

<p>The <i>Supply</i>, sailing very badly, had not permitted my gaining
the advantage hoped for, but I began to examine the bay as soon as we
anchored, and found that tho' extensive, it did not afford shelter to
ships from the easterly winds; the greater part of the Bay being so
shoal that ships of even a moderate draught of water are obliged to
anchor with the entrance of the bay open, and are exposed to a heavy
sea that rolls in when it blows hard from the eastward.</p>

<p>Several small runs of fresh water were found in different parts of
the bay, but I did not see any situation to which there was not some
very strong objection. The small creek that is in the northern part of
the bay runs a considerable way into the country, but it had only water
for a boat. The sides of this creek are frequently overflowed, and the
lowlands a swamp. The western branch runs up for a considerable
distance, but the officers I sent to examine it could not find any
water, except in very small drains.</p>

<p>The best situation that offered was near Point Sutherland, where
there was a small run of good water; but the ground near it, as well as
a considerable part of the higher ground, was spongy, and the ships
could not approach this part of the bay.</p>

<p>Several good situations offered for a small number of people, but
none that appeared calculated for our numbers, and where the stores and
provisions could be landed without a great loss of time. When I
considered the bay's being so very open, and the probability of the
swamps rendering the most eligible situation unhealthy, I judged it
advisable to examine Port Jackson; but that no time might be lost if I
did not succeed in finding a better harbour, and a proper situation for
the settlement, the ground near Point Sutherland was in the meantime to
be cleared and preparations made for landing under the direction of the
Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p>As the time in which I might be absent, if I went in the
<i>Supply</i>, must have been very uncertain, I went round with three
boats, taking with me Captain Hunter, and several officers, that by
examining different parts of the port at the same time less time might
be lost.</p>

<p>We got into Port Jackson early in the afternoon, and had the
satisfaction of finding the finest harbour in the world, in which a
thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security, and of
which a rough survey, made by Captain Hunter and the officers of the
<i>Sirius</i> after the ships came round, may give your Lordship some
idea.</p>

<p>The different coves were examined with all possible expedition. I
fixed on the one that had the best spring of water, and in which the
ships can anchor so close to the shore that at a very small expense
quays may be made at which the largest ships may unload.</p>

<p>This cove, which I honoured with the name of Sydney, is about a
quarter of a mile across at the entrance and half-a-mile in length.</p>

<p>We returned to Botany Bay the third day, where I received a very
unfavourable account of the ground that was clearing.</p>

<p>The ships immediately prepared to go round, and the 25th&mdash;seven
days after I arrived in the <i>Supply</i>&mdash;I sailed in her for
Port Jackson, leaving Captain Hunter to follow with the transports, it
then blowing too strong for them to work out of the bay. They joined me
the next evening, and all the transports were moored in the cove.</p>

<p>Two sail had appeared off Botany Bay the 24th, under French colours,
and anchored there before the <i>Sirius</i> left it&mdash;the
<i>Boussole</i> and the <i>Astrolabe</i>. These ships were commanded by
Monsieur La Perouse, who having expressed a desire of sending letters
to Europe, I sent an officer over, it being only eight miles, to tell
him in what time it was probable the ships might sail.</p>

<p>The clearing the ground for the people and for erecting storehouses
was begun as soon as the ships got round, a labour of which it will be
hardly possible to give your Lordship a just idea.</p>

<p>The necks of land that form the different coves, and near the water
for some distance, are in general so rocky that it is surprising that
such large trees should find sufficient nourishment, but the soil
between the rocks is good, and the summits of the rocks, as well as the
whole country round us, with few exceptions, are covered with trees,
most of which are so large that the removing them off the ground after
they are cut down is the greatest part of the labour; and the convicts,
naturally indolent, having none to attend them but overseers drawn from
amongst themselves, and who fear to exert any authority, makes this
work go on very slowly.</p>

<p>As there are only twelve convicts who are carpenters, as many as
could be procured from the ships have been hired to work on the
hospital and storehouses. The people were healthy when landed, but the
scurvy has for some time appeared amongst them, and now rages in a most
extraordinary manner. Only sixteen carpenters could be hired from the
ships, and several of the convict carpenters were sick. It was now the
middle of February; the rains began to fall very heavy, and pointed the
necessity of hutting the people; convicts were therefore appointed to
assist the detachment in this work.</p>

<p>The great labour in clearing the ground will not permit more than
eight acres to be sown this year with wheat and barley. At the same
time the immense number of ants and field mice will render our crops
very uncertain.</p>

<p>Part of the live stock brought from the Cape, small as it was, has
been lost, and our resource in fish is also uncertain. Some days great
quantities are caught, but never sufficient to save any part of the
provisions; and at times fish are scarce.</p>

<p>Your Lordship will, I presume, see the necessity of a regular supply
of provisions for four or five years, and of clothing, shoes and frocks
in the greatest proportion. The necessary implements for husbandry and
for clearing the ground brought out will, with difficulty, be made to
serve the time that is necessary for sending out a fresh supply.</p>

<p>The labour of the convicts shall be as is directed, for the public
stock, but it is necessary to permit a part of the convicts to work for
the officers, who, in our present situation, would otherwise find it
impossible to clear a sufficient quantity of ground to raise what is
absolutely necessary to support the little stock they have; and I am to
request that your Lordship will be pleased to direct me to what extent
that indulgence may be granted the officers of the garrison.</p>

<p>The <i>Sirius</i> shall be sent to the northward to barter for
stock, and which shall be employed solely for the purposes of
increasing the breed of such cattle as she may procure. The
<i>Supply</i> is in no ways calculated for this service, as in the
least sea her decks are full of water.</p>

<p>The beginning of May the rainy season was once more supposed to be
set in, but after a week we had fine weather.</p>

<p>The three transports for China sailed the 5th, 6th, and 8th of May;
and the <i>Supply</i> having been caulked sailed the 6th to Lord Howe
Island, to endeavour to procure turtle, in hopes of checking the scurvy
with which most of the people are affected, and near two hundred
rendered incapable of doing any work. It is not possible to send the
<i>Sirius</i> to the northward, for she must then have her carpenters,
and only three of those hired from the transports now remain; and tho'
the detachment began to build barracks for the use of the men and huts
for the officers the 14th of February, and near a hundred convicts were
given to assist in this work, they are not yet finished, nor is the
hospital or the storehouse that is to receive the provisions still
remaining on board three transports, and on these works the carpenters
of the <i>Sirius</i> are employed. I have before pointed out the great
labour in clearing the ground as one cause of our slow progress.</p>

<p>Your Lordship will, I hope, excuse the confused manner in which I
have in this letter given an account of what has passed since I left
the Cape of Good Hope. It has been written at different times, and my
situation at present does not permit me to begin so long a letter
again, the canvas house I am under being neither wind nor
waterproof.</p>

<p align="center">GOVERNOR PHILLIP TO UNDER-SECRETARY NEPEAN</p>

<p class='right'>Sydney Cove, <i>July 9th, 1788.</i></p>

<p>My Dear Sir,</p>

<p>You will see by my letters to Lord Sydney that this colony must for
some years depend on supplies from England.</p>

<p>The <i>Sirius</i> will be sent to the northward for live stock as
soon as we can spare her carpenters; and from what Monsieur la Perouse
said to Captain Hunter, one of the Isles des Navigateurs is the most
likely to furnish us with what we want. But though these Islands supply
two or three ships very abundantly, they will afford but very little
towards the support of this colony, the situation of which I have
particularly pointed out in my letter to Lord Sydney, and which I shall
recapitulate in this, as the ship by which I now write may arrive
before either of those that have my despatches on board.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-Governor has about four acres of land in cultivation.
I have from eight to ten in wheat and barley. The officers will be able
to raise sufficient to support the little live stock they have, and
which is all that can be expected from them. All the corn raised this
year and the next will be saved for seed, and if necessity should
oblige us to use it, it would be only a few days' support for the
colony; and from the rats and other vermin the crops are very
uncertain.</p>

<p>This country is subject to very heavy storms of thunder and
lightning, several trees having been set on fire, and some sheep and
dogs killed in the camp since we landed.</p>

<p>All the provisions we have to depend on until supplies arrive from
England are in two wooden buildings which are thatched. I am sensible
of the risk but have no remedy.</p>

<p>The greatest part of the stock brought from the Cape is dead, and
from the inattention of the men who had the care of the cattle, those
belonging to Government and two cows belonging to myself are lost. As
they have been missing three weeks, it is probable they are killed by
the natives. All my sheep are dead and a few only remain of those
purchased for Government. The loss of two cows and four bulls falls
very heavy. The horses do very well.</p>

<p>With respect to any resources that the Cape of Good Hope might
afford, I have only to observe that the strong westerly winds that
prevailed all the year between the Cape and the southern extremity of
this country would render a passage to the Cape very tedious if
attempted to the southward, and little less so if ships go to the
northward. Batavia and our own settlements are at a great distance; and
when the transports are sailed I shall have only the <i>Sirius</i> to
employ on a service of this kind; and as I should not think myself at
liberty to send either to the Cape or the East Indies unless in a case
of the greatest necessity, it would in all probability then be too
late. I mention these circumstances just to show the real situation of
the colony, and I make no doubt but that supplies will arrive in time,
and on which alone I depend. The provisions sent to support this colony
for two years being put on board three ships, was running a very great
risk, for had they separated and afterwards been lost the consequence
is obvious, for this country at present does not furnish the smallest
resource except in fish, and which has lately been so scarce that the
natives find great difficulty in supporting themselves. Any accident of
this kind will be guarded against, of course; and soldiers or convicts
when sent out will be put on board the ships with provisions to serve
them for two years after they land; and in our present situation I hope
few convicts will be sent out for one year at least, except carpenters,
masons, and bricklayers, or farmers, who can support themselves and
assist in supporting others. Numbers of those now here are a burthen
and incapable of any kind of hard labour, and, unfortunately, we have
not proper people to keep those to their labour who are capable of
being made useful.</p>

<p>Officers decline the least interference with the convicts, unless
when they are immediately employed for their (the officers) own
conveniency or when they are called out at the head of their men; the
saying of a few words to encourage the diligent when they saw them at
work, and the pointing out the idle when they could do it without going
out of their way, was all that was desired. The convicts were then
employed in clearing the ground on which the officers were encamped,
and this they refused; they did not suppose they were sent out to do
more than garrison duty, and these gentlemen (that is, the majority of
the officers) think the being obliged to sit as members of the Criminal
Court an hardship, and for which they are not paid, and likely think
themselves hardly dealt by, in that Government had not determined what
lands were to be given to them. But I presume an additional force will
be sent out when the necessity of making detachments in order to
cultivate lands in the more open country is known, and from four to six
hundred men, will, I think, be absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>If fifty farmers were sent out with their families they would do
more in one year in rendering this colony independent of the mother
country <i>as to provisions</i> than a thousand convicts. There is some
clear land which is intended to be cultivated, at some distance from
the camp, and I intended to send out convicts for that purpose, under
the direction of a person that was going to India in the
<i>Charlotte</i>, transport, but who remained to settle in this
country, and has been brought up a farmer, but several of the convicts
(three) have been lately killed by the natives, and I have been obliged
to defer it until a detachment can be made.</p>

<p>The natives are far more numerous than they were supposed to be. I
think they cannot be less than fifteen hundred in Botany Bay, Port
Jackson, and Broken Bay, including the intermediate coast. I have
traced thirty miles inland, and the having lately seen smoke on
Lansdown Hills, which are fifty miles inland, I think leaves no doubt
but there are inhabitants in the interior parts of the country.</p>

<p>Lists of what articles are most wanted will be sent by the
Commissary, and I am very sorry to say that not only a great part of
the clothing, particularly the women's, is very bad, but most of the
axes, spades, and shovels the worst that ever were seen. The provision
is as good. Of the seeds and corn sent from England part has been
destroyed by the weevil; the rest is in very good order.</p>

<p>The person I have appointed Provost-Marshal is likewise very useful
in superintending the carpentry; the person sent out by the contractor,
who assists the Commissary in the delivery of provisions, one that was
clerk of the <i>Sirius</i>, a master smith, and two farmers, are very
useful people, and I beg leave to recommend them to Government. The
granting them lands would draw their attention from their present
occupations.</p>

<p>A convict who fled to the woods after committing a robbery returned
after being absent eighteen days, forced in by hunger; he had got some
small support from the people, and the few fish left by accident on the
beach after hauling the seine, and had endeavoured to live amongst the
natives, but they could but give him but little assistance; he says
they are now greatly distressed for food, and that he saw several dying
with hunger. It is possible that some of the natives at this time of
year might find it easier to support themselves on birds and such
animals as shelter themselves in the hollow trees, than on fish; but
then, I think, they would not go to the top of the mountains, where at
present it must be very cold. I intend going to Lansdown or Carmarthen
Hills as soon as the weather permits, if it is possible, and which will
explain what is at present a mystery to me&mdash;how people who have
not the least idea of cultivation can maintain themselves in the
interior part of this country. When I went to the westward, in hopes of
being able to reach the mountains, we carried six days' provisions, and
proceeded five days to the westward; returning we were very short of
provisions, and our guns only procured us two scanty meals.</p>

<p>I shall conclude with saying that I have no doubt but that the
country will hereafter prove a most valuable acquisition to Great
Britain, though at present no country can afford less support to the
first settlers, or be more disadvantageously placed for receiving
support from the mother country, on which it must for a time depend. It
will require patience and perseverance, neither of which will, I hope,
be wanting on the part of</p>

<p align="center">THE RIGHT HON. W.W. GRENVILLE TO GOVERNOR PHILLIP</p>

<p class='right'>Whitehall, <i>19th June 1789.</i></p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>The discontents which have prevailed in the marine detachment, and
the desire expressed by most of the officers and men to return home as
soon as they shall have performed the tour of duty they had undertaken,
have led to the making arrangements for relieving them. With that view
His Majesty has ordered a corps to be raised for that particular
service, consisting of three hundred rank and file and a suitable
number of officers under a Major-Commandant. This corps is ordered to
be in readiness for embarkation on the 1st of October next, and will,
it is expected, soon after that time proceed upon the voyage.</p>

<p align="center">GRENVILLE TO PHILLIP</p>

<p class='right'><i>Dec. 24th, 1789.</i></p>

<p>The corps which I before informed you was to be raised to serve
within your Government, instead of the marines now doing duty there,
has been complete for some time past. A detachment from it, consisting
of about 100 officers and men, has been put on board the convict ships
for their greater security against attempts which the convicts might
meditate, and the remainder, under the command of Major Grose,
amounting as you will see by the enclosed establishment to upwards of
200 more, will, I expect, embark at Portsmouth on board His Majesty's
ship the <i>Gorgon</i>, in the course of a few days.</p>

<p align="center">GOVERNOR HUNTER TO THE DUKE OF PORTLAND</p>

<p class='right'>Sydney, New South Wales,</p>

<p class='right'><i>10th Aug., 1796.</i></p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>Having occasion in my letter, No. 9. by the ship <i>Marquis
Cornwallis</i>, to notice very particularly a paragraph in your Grace's
letter of the 10th of June, 1795, which related to the conduct of the
military serving upon Norfolk Island in 1794, and which gave me
occasion to mention similar outrage having been committed by the
soldiers here since my arrival, I signified in that letter that I
thought it might be improper in me to suppress or keep from your
Grace's knowledge that outrage, and that it should be communicated at a
future opportunity. I therefore enclose for your Grace's information a
paper, No. 1, containing the particulars, stated in as brief a manner
as possible. I forbear, my Lord, to make any observations upon this
violent and extraordinary conduct on the part of the soldiers. I
transmit only a statement of the facts, leaving your Grace wholly
uninfluenced by anything I might have occasion to remark upon so daring
a violation of the peace and order of the settlement, as well as in
defiance of those laws by which that peace is to be preserved.</p>

<p>But as an alteration in the ration had at that time been ordered, I
think it necessary to observe that their temper at the moment was so
violent that they positively refused to take it unless they were served
all flour, instead of part flour and part corn, a desire which could
not be complied with without manifest injustice to others, and also
insisted upon being paid short-allowance money for the time they were
on short ration, which they say Governor Phillip had promised them.
This last demand I must request your Grace's instructions upon.</p>

<p>The paper No. 2 is the Public Order which I gave out immediately
after the outrage; No. 3 is a copy of my letter to the commanding
officer of the corps upon that occasion; and No. 4 is a paper which was
intended to quiet the minds of the inhabitants of the settlement, who
might naturally (if no steps were taken to punish the offenders in this
case, nor any particular notice be taken of the offence committed by
them) conceive themselves subject to such violence and oppression from
the military whenever any soldier might think fit to take offence at
them. These papers are all which I think it necessary to trouble your
Grace with upon this occasion, as the facts will best speak for
themselves, and prevent the possibility of a conjecture that any unfair
representation could have been intended.</p>

<p>I should feel myself deficient in that duty which I owe to His
Majesty's service in this part of the world were I not to take a
liberty which I have no reason to believe your Grace will be offended
at&mdash;I mean, in remarking that the manner in which this corps has,
since employed upon this service, been recruited, does in a great
measure weaken the effect or service which we would expect to derive
from the assistance of the military. Soldiers from the Savoy, and other
characters who have been considered as disgraceful to every other
regiment in His Majesty's service, have been thought fit and proper
recruits for the New South Wales Corps, which, in my humble opinion, my
Lord, should have been composed of the very best and most orderly
dispositions. They are sent here to guard and keep in obedience to the
laws when force may be requisite, a set of the worst, the most
atrocious characters that ever disgraced human nature; and yet we find
amongst those safeguards men capable of corrupting the heart of the
best disposed, and often superior in every species of infamy to the
most expert in wickedness amongst the convicts. Our stores, provisions,
and granaries must be intrusted to the care of these men; what security
can we have in the hands of such people? None, my Lord. Your Grace will
see the impropriety of such recruits being sent to this country, and
mixed with a corps who have the care of our most valuable concerns. Not
to detain your Grace, I will beg permission to observe that a corps of
military to be permanently established for the service of this colony,
to which the dregs and refuse of our native country are directed by its
laws to be sent as a punishment, cannot be attended with that advantage
which may have been expected from it.</p>

<p>This, I confess, my Lord, to be my opinion, and for this reason,
that they will make connections with infamous characters here, whatever
attention may be paid by their officers to prevent it; by this means
they will in time be corrupted and rendered unfit people for the trust
which we must repose in them. It might probably be thought expensive to
relieve them as other garrisons, once in three, four, or five years;
but I cannot help believing, my Lord, that the service would be much
benefited by such a measure; and two forty-four-gun ships armed <i>en
flute</i> sailing at a proper season would complete the relief, and
return in from twelve to fourteen months, frequently less. The expense
attending this measure will probably be an objection; but, my Lord,
although the saving to be made by it may appear too remote to merit
immediate notice, yet I am convinced it would ultimately prove a
saving, and no inconsiderable one.</p>

<p align="center">(Enclosure No. 1)</p>

<p align="center">STATEMENT OF THE CASE OF JOHN BAUGHAN</p>

<p>John Baughan who officiates as foreman of the carpenters working at
Sydney, and a private soldier of the New South Wales Corps, of the same
profession, had some dispute when formerly working together on an
occasion when Baughan had the direction. This dispute, it appeared, had
not subsided in the mind of the soldier, and probably was not wholly
forgot by the other. It, however, was more conspicuous in the soldier,
from the following circumstance:&mdash;One day when sentinel over a
storehouse, knowing that Baughan was at work in a house some distance
from his post, he set his arms down against the wall of the store, and
seeing a man whom he knew, standing on the outside of the building in
which Baughan was at work, entered into a conversation with him, of
which Baughan was the subject, and in which much abuse was bestowed
which it was meant that he, Baughan, should hear. Baughan went out at
the back door unperceived, and seeing the soldier without his arms,
went to his post, where he found the musquet, which he took up and
carried to the guardhouse and delivered to the sergeant of the guard.
The soldier was, of course, taken notice of and relieved, being without
his arms. The next day, 5th February, at half-past nine o'clock in the
forenoon the whole of the corps off duty at this place assembled, and
in the most public and tumultuous manner proceeded to the dwelling of
John Baughan, broke open his gates, doors and windows, entered his
house, chopped the corner-posts of it, broke his bedsteads and bedding,
chairs, window-frames, drawers, chests, and, in short, completely
demolished everything within his possession to a considerable amount,
for the man had by great labour and industry built himself a neat house
and had it well furnished.</p>

<p>Upon their first approach, having had a few minutes' notice, he
armed himself with a loaded gun and defended himself by threats for
some time, but their numbers were so many that they surrounded his
paling which enclosed the house, which some tore down, and entered on
the opposite side to that which he endeavoured to defend, came behind
him, secured and threw him down with his face to the ground, whilst one
held an axe over his neck, and swore if he offered to stir, he would
chop the head from his body. During the time he remained in this
situation they completed the ruin of his whole property, to the very
great terror of the man's wife, after which they went off cheering, as
if something meritorious had been effected, and marched in a body
across the parade before their commanding officer's house.</p>

<p>After so daring an attack in the open day, upon the dwelling-house
of an inhabitant, and in direct defiance of all law, civil or military,
they could only be considered as in a state of mutiny. I immediately
issued in Public Orders the papers No. 2.</p>

<p class='right'><i>5th Feb., 1796.</i></p>

<p>Parole&mdash;Milbrook.</p>

<p class='right'>Countersign&mdash;Cawsand.</p>

<p>The very riotous manner in which the soldiers have conducted
themselves this morning, and the very unwarrantable liberty they have
thought proper to take in destroying the dwelling-house of John
Baughan, is so flagrant a crime against the laws established in this
colony that nothing but the want of proof to substantiate who the
principal actors in this disgraceful business were, could possibly
prevent their being immediately tried for so glaring an offence against
the peace of the colony.</p>

<p>The Governor thinks it necessary to assure the soldiers that he
considers their conduct upon this occasion to have been disgraceful to
the character of a British soldier, and that he did hope to have found
men amongst them who would have had pride enough to have stood forward
and have pointed out the ringleaders of so mutinous a conduct, for in
no other light can it be considered than that of mutiny when the
military assemble in such numbers unknown to their officers, who are at
all times ready to listen to any complaints they may have to make, and
to see that agreeable to common justice they are redressed. If the
soldiers expect that the Governor or any of the officers in this
settlement can hereafter consider them as hereafter meriting the
honourable appellation of British troops, it must be by their bringing
forward the ringleaders or advisers of this disgraceful conduct, in
order that the stigma may be wiped away by such worthless characters
being brought to trial for this shameful conduct.</p>

<p align="center">GOVERNOR HUNTER TO CAPTAIN PATERSON</p>

<p class='right'>Sydney, <i>7th Feb. 1796.</i></p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Since I saw you this morning I have turned in my mind the subject of
our conversation, and I have in consequence changed my intention of
speaking to the soldiers myself. I see that it would be a condescension
on my part which their violent and unsoldierlike conduct does not
entitle them to from me. I stand in this colony as the Chief
Magistrate, and the representative of our Sovereign; anything,
therefore, that could lessen me in the eye of the public would be
degrading the King's authority, which shall never suffer in my person
whilst I am capable of giving it its full power and consequence. I
never can or will listen to the complaints of any set of men who feel
themselves above preferring them with moderation, and a decent
submission to the laws and regulations of the colony; they must
not&mdash;they shall not&mdash;dictate laws and rules for the
government of this settlement; they were sent here by His Majesty to
support the civil power in the execution of its functions, but they
seem disposed to take all law into their own hands, and to direct it in
whatever way best may suit their own views.</p>

<p>Their violence upon the late occasion shall be laid before the King,
and the principal actors in it shall be pointedly marked, in order that
justice the most perfect be done to everyone concerned in it. I must
declare to you, sir, that the conduct of this part of the New South
Wales Corps has been, in my opinion the most violent and outrageous
that was ever heard of by any British regiment whatever, and I shall
consider every step they may go farther in aggravation as rebellion
against His Majesty's Government and authority, of which the most early
notice shall be taken, and those concerned be in due time obliged to
answer for it most probably with their lives. This is all I think it
necessary to trouble you with. Their conduct will be pointedly marked
thro' all its stages, and I will be firm and resolved in such steps as
it may be necessary for me to pursue, and of this you, as their
commanding Officer, will be pleas'd to inform them.</p>

<p>My Lord Duke,</p>

<p>I have for some time been in doubt whether the representation I am
about to make to your Grace should be private or public, but on
considering that it might occasion the adoption of some measure
interesting to the concerns of this colony, I have preferred the latter
mode.</p>

dissatisfied with their situation here, so extremely insolent,
refractory, and troublesome, that, without the most rigid and severe
treatment it is impossible for us to receive any labour whatever from
them. Your Grace will see the inconvenience which so large a proportion

conceived an opinion that there is a colony of white people in some
part of this country in which they will receive all the comforts of
life without the necessity of labour. They have lately taken away two
of our breeding mares to carry them towards that part of the country
and have made several attempts to possess themselves of others. This,
my Lord, is a serious inconvenience to the colony. The loss of any part
of our small stock of these useful animals is a matter of peculiar
concern.</p>

<p>A correspondence, it seems, has been carried on by these people from
one district to another, and plans have been projected for their
escaping from the colony, and a few have attempted by land, as well as
by water, and for the want of our having earlier information they have
succeeded. I have found it necessary to divide them as much as
possible, to prevent such schemes being formed; but by this separation
they have a better opportunity of irritating and inflaming the minds of
those convicts who before such acquaintance have been found of better
disposition.</p>

<p>Having already mentioned in my letter, No. 30, the escape of those
who had taken away two of our boats, and the disappointment of another
gang, and similar attempt, I have now to inform your Grace of a far
more numerous gang, who had provided what they thought necessary for
their expedition, had fixed upon the place of general rendezvous, and
were furnished with a paper of written instructions how they were to
travel in point of direction from hence to this fancied paradise, or to
China. This paper of directions will warrant my suspicion that some
wicked and disaffected person or persons lurk somewhere in this colony,
and I have done all in my power to discover them, but hitherto without
success. Having received early information of the intention of this
party, who were said to have increased to about sixty, I planted a
party of armed constables, on whose vigilance I could depend, and they
secured a gang of these Defenders of about twenty and brought them to
prison. The next day I spoke to them, but observing a considerable
degree of obstinacy and ignorance about them, I conceived there could
be no better argument used to convince them of their misconduct than a
severe corporal punishment, which was inflicted, and they have since
been strictly looked after at their work. Some of those fellows had
been provided with a figure of a compass drawn upon paper which, with
written instructions, was to have assisted them as their guide. The
ignorance of these deluded people, my Lord, would scarcely be credited
if such positive proof of it were not before us, and yet (which seems
to imply a kind of contradiction) it is extraordinary with what art and
cunning they form their horrible plans of wickedness and villainy.</p>

<p>In their schemes of desertion from the colony, their own death, if
they succeed in getting away, is inevitable; but their minds have been
worked up to such a pitch of folly, rashness, and absurdity, that
nothing but experience will convince them; if we suffer them to escape
into the country they are lost, not only to us but to the world, for
perish they must.</p>

<p>For the sake, therefore, of humanity, and a strong desire to save
these men, worthless as they are, from impending death, I ordered four
of the strongest and hardiest of their numbers to be selected by the
people themselves, and to prepare for a journey of discovery for the
satisfaction of their associates, in order that they might have an
opportunity of relating upon their return whatever they saw and met
with. I had, farther, for the safety and preservation of those four,
directed three people, long accustomed to the woods, and acquainted
with some of the mountain savages, to accompany them; these men had
also a little knowledge of the language of the savages, from having
lived some months amongst them, and they were instructed to lead them
back when, fatigued and exhausted with their journey over steep and
rocky mountains, through thick and extensive woods, and fording deep
and rapid rivers, they should feel disposed to abandon their journey.
This plan was no sooner settled than I received information that a
party of these miscreants had agreed with the four above-mentioned to
meet them at a certain place absolutely to murder the very persons
intended to be their guides, and to possess themselves of their arms
and munitions and provisions, in addition to what each was supplied
with, and to take their own route. These circumstances will, no doubt,
appear to your Grace wild and extravagant; but after having mentioned
their ignorance in the manner I have it may serve to convince your
Grace that there are improper persons in this colony who work upon that
ignorance to a dangerous degree. In consequence of the information of
this design against their guides, I ordered four soldiers to attend
them to the foot of the first mountain with orders how to act if any
others attempted to join them; none appeared, and the whole of them
returned with the soldiers, most completely sick of their journey.</p>

<p>Our flocks and our crops, my Lord, are all I feel any concern about;
strict, rigid, and just punishment shall constantly hang over these
delinquents, and this, I trust, they are already convinced of. I hope
the return of the above three, and the story they can tell, will serve
to make them more contented with their present lot, and open their eyes
to the comforts which in this country they may derive and enjoy, and
which are certainly superior to any they ever possessed in their
own.</p>

<p>Strange as such instances of human ignorance and depravity are, I
have to inform your Grace that a small party of those very people, some
short time after, actually contrived to make their escape, and after
travelling for many weeks through the country, made shift to reach the
sea-coast, near Botany Bay, but in a part where no boat has ever been
seen. Providentially, however, a boat had lost her way in going to
George's River and found those unhappy deluded wretches, on a place
where they had been nine days, and where they must soon have perished
but for this miraculous event. They were brought back almost exhausted
from want of food, and from sad and powerful conviction have promised
to warn their countrymen against such wild excursions in future.</p>

<p>I will here take an opportunity of mentioning that those men who had
left a part of their crew upon an island to the southward, and had
returned and taken a larger boat at Broken Bay, and had been wrecked
upon the coast to the northward, built out of the ruins of their vessel
a small boat in which they reached the above Bay; but not being able to
possess themselves of another, fit for their purpose, were, for want of
food, driven to the necessity of travelling across the country; they
wrote to me, but it was impossible to listen to their feigned story;
they were armed and carried some appearance of an intention to defend
themselves; they, however, surrendered themselves up, and were tried
and severally pleaded guilty of the robberies wherewith they were
charged, and two out of the six suffered death&mdash;an awful example,
which, I hope, will have a proper effect and prevent such attempts in
future. Several of them assured me that they had seen the wreck of the
first boat&mdash;which I mentioned in my letter No. 30&mdash;and it is
very probable the crew have perished.</p>

</blockquote>

<p align="center">MAJOR JOHNSTON TO VISCOUNT CASTLEREAGH</p>

<p class='right'>Headquarters, Sydney, N.S.W.<br>
<i>11th April, 1808.</i></p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>A series of almost incredible circumstances have imposed upon me the
distressing task and responsibility of superseding the authority vested
in Governor Bligh by His Majesty's Commission, and of assuming the
Government of this colony until His Majesty's pleasure shall be
signified, or until the arrival of an officer authorized to relieve me
in the Command.</p>

<p>Whenever the facts that have influenced me throughout so solemn a
transaction shall be laid before my Gracious Sovereign, I humbly trust
His Majesty will approve of my conduct, and that it will be apparent I
had no alternative but to put Governor Bligh in arrest to prevent an
insurrection of the inhabitants, and to secure him and the persons he
confided in from being massacred by the incensed multitude, or, if the
Governor had escaped so dreadful an end, and retained his authority, to
see His Majesty's benevolent and paternal Government dishonour'd by
cruelties and merciless execution.</p>

<p>The event that I have the honour to report to your Lordship took
place on the 26th of last January, and although such a space of time
has since elapsed, I have found it impossible to prepare that arranged
detail, and that connected chain of evidence which so uncommon a
subject has made it my indispensable duty to transmit to your
Lordship.</p>

<p>Why I have been unable to perform this task, I shall, as I proceed,
endeavour to explain, and I respectfully hope that the information and
the evidence which I now propose to forward will prove to your Lordship
that Governor Bligh has betrayed the high trust and Confidence reposed
in him by his Sovereign, and acted upon a predetermined plan to subvert
the Laws of his country, to terrify and influence the Courts of
Justice, and to bereave those persons who had the misfortune to be
obnoxious to him, of their fortunes, their liberty, and their
lives.</p>

<p>In the accomplishment of this plan, one act of oppression was
succeeded in a progressive course by a greater, until a general
sensation of alarm and terror prevailed throughout the settlement.
Several inhabitants were dispossessed of their houses, and many others
of respectable characters, or who had become opulent by trade, were
threatened with the Governor's resentment if they presumed to build
upon or alienate their own lands.</p>

<p>These measures and various other acts of violence were projected and
supported by the Governor and a junto of unprincipled men, amongst whom
it was well known and has since been proved, the notorious George
Crossley, sent to this colony for perjury, was the principal person,
and the one most confided in by the Governor.</p>

<p>Your Lordship will not be surprised that a Government conducted by
the aid of such a Minister should be hated and detested as well as
feared.</p>

<p>All the inhabitants who were a little advanced in their
circumstances beyond the common mass dreaded the approach of the moment
when their turn would come to be sacrificed to the avarice, the
resentment, or the fury of the Governor and his friends.</p>

<p>But whilst they were trembling with apprehension for their own
safety, the eyes of the whole were suddenly turned from the
contemplation of the general danger to that of Mr. Macarthur, a
gentleman who was many years an officer in the New South Wales Corps,
and who now possesses a large property in this Country.</p>

<p>The extent of Mr. Macarthur's estate, the number of his flocks and
herds, it had been long seen, had made him extremely obnoxious to Gov'r
Bligh. Mr. Macarthur, sensible how much he had to dread from the
ill-will of an officer of the Gov'r's well-known character, endeavoured
to provide for his security by the most scrupulous circumspection and
prudence of conduct. Secluded in a profound retirement on his estate,
and unceasingly engaged in its management and the care and education of
his children, his name was never heard of in any public business; but
neither caution nor prudence could long shield him from the hostile
spirit of the Governor. The attack was first commenced upon his
reputation, and terminated in the imprisonment of his person in the
Common Gaol.</p>

<p>After a variety of introductory measures, which your Lordship will
find detailed in the copy of the proceedings of a Court of Criminal
Judicature, to which I shall hereafter refer, Mr. Macarthur surrendered
as a prisoner at its bar on the 25th of last January, charged with two
separate misdemeanours. When the members of the Court had been sworn
in, and they were proceeding to swear in Richard Atkins, Esq., the
Judge-Advocate, Mr. Macarthur presented a protest, in which he urged a
variety of objections against that officer's presiding at his trial.
Mr. Atkins endeavoured to prevail upon the Court not to receive or hear
the protest read; but the members being of opinion it ought to be
heard, directed Mr. Macarthur to proceed. The Judge-Advocate then
retired from his chair and waited until Mr. Macarthur had read the
protest. When that was done he advanced again, and declared Mr.
Macarthur should be immediately committed to Gaol.</p>

<p>The Court then interfered on behalf of Mr. Macarthur, and after a
long altercation the Judge-Advocate retired from the Court-House,
leaving behind him his papers.</p>

<p>These were immediately taken possession of and examined by the
Members, and those papers led to a discovery that the whole plan of the
trial had been arranged, and every question prepared that was to be
asked the evidence of the prosecution by the infamous Crossley.</p>

<p>A very awful impression was made upon the minds of the inhabitants,
as I have been informed, when they saw Mr. Macarthur taken to the gaol;
many respectable persons hastened to him; and when the Court assembled
at 10 o'clock his two bonds men presented a copy of the Warrant for his
apprehension and a deposition from themselves.</p>

<p>The Court directly wrote to the Governor a letter expressive of
their concern and praying Mr. Macarthur might be restored to his bail.
To this letter no answer was given, and the Court having waited till 3
o'clock adjourned.</p>

<p>When it was known that the Court had broken up without having
procured Mr. Macarthur's enlargement, the agitation of the town became
greatly increased, and information was brought to me at four o'clock by
Mr. Harris, Surgeon of the New South Wales Corps, that an insurrection
of the Inhabitants was to be feared. In a few minutes after I had
received this intelligence a Dragoon arrived with a letter from the
Governor, in which I was informed that six of the officers of the New
South Wales Corps had been charged with treasonable practices, and were
summoned to appear before the Governor and the Magistrates at nine
o'clock the next morning. I immediately set off in a carriage to the
Town.</p>

<p>On my arrival at the Barracks I saw all the Civil and Military
Officers collected, and the most respectable inhabitants in
conversation with them. The common people were also to be seen in
various groups in every street murmuring and loudly complaining, whilst
others were watching the movements of Crossley and the Magistrates who
frequently passed from the Judge Advocate's to the Government House. At
this moment it was also known that the Governor was shut up in Council
with the depraved and desperate Crossley, Mr. Palmer, the Commissary,
Mr. Campbell, a Merchant, and Mr. Arndell (the latter three,
Magistrates) and that Mr. Gore (the Provost-Marshal) and Mr. Fulton
(the Chaplain) were also at Government House, all ready to sanction
whatever Crossley proposed or the Governor ordered.</p>

<p>The gentlemen who had assembled on my arrival earnestly entreated me
to adopt decisive measures for the safety of the inhabitants and to
dispel the great alarm, as it was understood throughout the town that
the Members of the Court of Criminal Judicature would be thrown into
Gaol; and it was expected after such a measure nothing could limit the
excess of the Governor's cruelties; the gentlemen also warmly urged me
to bail Mr. Macarthur, so that he might consult with them on the
measures most proper to recommend at so extraordinary a crisis.</p>

<p>As I had no doubt of the illegality of Mr. Macarthur's confinement,
I felt no difficulty in acceding to the request, and Mr. Macarthur
being released from the Gaol directly joined the Assembly of Officers
and inhabitants who were then at the Barracks.</p>

<p>In a short time after, a letter was presented to me imploring me
instantly to put Governor Bligh in arrest, and to assume the Command of
the Colony. This letter was also approved of by all the Officers of the
Corps present at Head-Quarters; and as the events I had myself
witnessed left me no cause to doubt the propriety and necessity of
complying with this requisition, I immediately ordered the Corps under
Arms, and directed four Officers to proceed to Government House and
summon Governor Bligh to resign his authority. The Corps quickly
followed, attended by the Civil Officers and a considerable number of
respectable inhabitants.</p>

<p>The four officers who had carried the summons met me at the
Governor's door and reported that he was nowhere to be found, nor any
information to be obtained of him, although the strongest assurances
had been given that his person should be strictly guarded from insult
or violence.</p>

<p>After a rigid search the Governor, however, was at last discovered,
in a situation too disgraceful to be mentioned, and which I solemnly
declare to your Lordship would have been most gratifying to my feelings
had it been possible to have concealed from the public. As soon as
Governor Bligh made his appearance, I assured him of his personal
safety and of every attention in my power to offer him.</p>

<p>Whilst the search was making for Governor Bligh I was entreated by
the Civil Officers and the Inhabitants to proclaim Martial Law, and
this request meeting my approbation, Martial Law was instantly
proclaimed and continued in force until the next day. As not a single
act of disorder or irregularity was committed during the interesting
scene that I have had the honour to describe to your Lordship, and as
the most perfect peace and tranquillity were restored throughout the
whole settlement I published a Proclamation the next morning, revoking
the order of the preceding evening and restoring the Civil
Government.</p>

<p>I ordered the Court of Criminal Judicature to assemble that Mr.
Macarthur might be arraigned on the Indictment that was found amongst
the Judge-Advocate's papers, and that the trial might proceed on the
plan Crossley had suggested to secure his conviction. The evidences
were examined in the order Crossley had prescribed, and every question
asked that he had previously dictated. Your Lordship will discover from
the copy of the Trial that Mr. Macarthur was acquitted without being
put on his defence, and that a complete disclosure was made of the
plans which had been deliberately formed for the ruin and destruction
of that gentleman.</p>

<p>I respectfully trust this trial and the confessions of the
Magistrates and other confidential persons will convince your Lordship
of the guilty intentions of Governor Bligh, and how little he regarded
the sacred personage whom he represented by suffering himself to be
guided by a wretch like that man Crossley to persecute and oppress His
Majesty's subjects.</p>

<p>I am now, my Lord, arrived at the most painful part of my
task&mdash;an explanation of the causes that have prevented me from
preparing a better arranged Statement of the transactions in which I
have been engaged; and it is with deep concern I find myself obliged to
report to your Lordship that the opposition from those persons from
whom I had most reason to expect support has been one of the principal
obstacles I have had to encounter.</p>

<p>When the officers and inhabitants found themselves relieved from the
oppressions of Governor Bligh, the general joy that was felt displayed
itself in rejoicings, bonfires, illuminations, and in a manifestation
of the most perfect unanimity. Even the lowest class of the prisoners
were influenced by the same sentiments, and for a short time abandoned
their habits of plundering. The contemplation of this happy scene more
than repaid me for the increase of care, fatigue, and responsibility to
which I had submitted for the public benefit; but the unanimity in
which I felt so much pleasure I quickly discovered was not to be
preserved without a sacrifice of His Majesty's interests, and a
departure from the regulations that have been made to check the
importation of Spirituous Liquors into the Colony.</p>

<p>I shall no longer obtrude upon your Lordship on this occasion than
to solicit that whenever the representation of what has taken place
here shall be communicated to my Gracious Sovereign, your Lordship will
have the goodness to offer my humble assurances that I have sacrificed
comparative ease, and have taken upon myself so great a responsibility
rather than submit to be a witness of His Majesty's sacred name being
profaned and dishonoured by deeds of injustice and violence.</p>

<p>The Public Peace being happily and, I trust in Almighty God,
permanently established I hereby proclaim the Cessation of Martial Law.
I have this day appointed Magistrates and other Public Functionaries
from amongst the most respectable officers and inhabitants, which will,
I hope, secure the impartial Administration of Justice, according to
the laws of England, as secured to us by the Patent of Our Most
Gracious Sovereign.</p>

<p>Words cannot too strongly convey my approbation of the behaviour of
the whole body of the People on the late memorable Event. By their
manly, firm and orderly conduct they have shown themselves deserving of
that Protection which I have felt it was my duty to give them, And
which I doubt not they will continue to merit.</p>

<p>In future no man shall have just cause to complain of Violence,
Injustice or Oppression; No free Man shall be taken, imprisoned, or

impartially administered without regard to or respect of persons; and
every man shall enjoy the fruits of his industry in Security.</p>

<p>I am directed by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor to acquaint you
that the late Magistrates and other persons (who it is proved you were
in the habit of consulting) have been examined on Oath before
Committees constituted under the Lieutenant-Governor's authority; that
from the confessions of those Persons it appears that you have been
acting upon a settled plan to subvert the Laws, to terrify and
influence the Courts of Justice, and to deprive every person who had
the misfortune to be obnoxious to you of their Property, Liberty, and
Lives. The Lieutenant-Governor feeling that an offence of such
magnitude must be productive of the most serious consequences, is
impelled by sentiments of Humanity to give you this early notice that
you may consider and seriously reflect on the measures which may be
necessary for your Justification.</p>

<p>His Honour has further directed me to assure you that as soon as the
examinations are complete, you shall be furnished with a Copy, and
that, if you think proper, all the Evidences shall be re-examined in
your presence, and be directed to answer any questions you like to
propose to them. His Honour has also desired me to assure you that it
will give him the greatest satisfaction to contribute by every means in
his power to the Alleviation of the distress of your present situation,
and to the comfort and accommodation of you and your family.</p>

<p align="center">GOVERNOR KING TO EARL CAMDEN</p>

<p class='right'>Sydney, N.S.W., <i>20th July, 1805.</i></p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>By Mr. MacArthur, who arrived the 9th Ult'o, I had the honour of
receiving your Lordship's Letters dated as per margin.</p>

<p>It will be my Duty and Interest to pay the strictest attention to
His Majesty's Commands and your Lordship's wishes in every point that
can advance the increase and improvement of the breed of sheep for
which a better foundation could not be laid, or the Success more
ensured, than the progressive increase of the Stock throughout the
Colony. Mr. MacArthur possesses at least a third of the Numbers, a
considerable part of which were reported at the last muster to bear
Wool of the finest kind, and the rest, as well as the other flocks, are
continually improving from the hairy Coverings of the original breed to
wool of different qualities, principally owing to the introduction of a
few Spanish Rams some years ago.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. MacArthur's arrival we conversed together respecting
the Objects of his laudable and, I hope, successful pursuits for the
general benefit of the Colony, as well as for that of his Family, which
he now regards as attached to the soil. His having bought a Ship to be
employed in the Whale Fishery, I consider an object equally laudable
and beneficial, exclusive of his being able to export the Wool of his
increasing breed to England once in Eighteen Months or Two Years, and
returning with Articles of use and Comfort to sell the Inhabitants. Nor
ought I to doubt from his assurances, that every expected benefit may
be derived from his exertions, as he is certainly very equal to conduct
and promote the Object he has so earnestly and, I hope, successfully
embarked in. To attain which he does and will possess every local
advantage that a good Stock to begin with, a good Climate, and fine
natural pastorage can offer.</p>

<p>Taking your Lordship's Letter No. 18 as a data, respecting the Land
to be located to Mr. MacArthur, wherein you do me the honour to signify
His Majesty's Commands that "I will have a proper grant of Lands, fit
for the pasture of sheep, conveyed to the said John MacArthur Esquire,
in perpetuity, with the usual reserve of Quit-Rents to the Crown,
containing not less than Five Thousand Acres," and Your Lordship having
noticed that "It will be impossible for Mr. MacArthur to pursue this
plan unless he shall be indulged with a reasonable number of Convicts
(which he states to be not less than thirty) for the purpose of
attending his sheep, and that as Mr. MacArthur will take upon himself
the Charges of maintaining these Convicts, a saving will accrue to
Government; and that you doubt not I will provide him with such as
shall appear as most suitable to his Objects."</p>

<p>In order to expedite Mr. MacArthur's Object of exporting fine Wool
to England, I have directed One hundred of the finest woolled Ewes from
Government Stock to be chosen for this gentleman to add to his own, for
which he is to pay Grain into the Stores at the rate of Two Pounds
sterling for each Ewe. As I do not consider it an Object for Government
to interfere in this pursuit, Seeing that the greatest exertions will
be made by Mr. MacArthur, And notwithstanding every attention has been
paid to improve the Fleeces of Government Sheep, Yet that Stock will
always be a reserve for supplying present and future Settlers with
proportions thereof, which will at once save the Necessity of
purchasing to Supply New Settlers who have Claims, and preserve a
residue for those deserving characters who may be allowed the advantage
of exchanging Grain for Ewes, agreeable to my Lord Hobart's
Acquiescence with my proposal on that Subject.</p>

<p>The number of Male Convicts assigned to Mr. MacArthur for the Care
of his Stock, etc., previous to his return, was Sixteen; Since then
they have been increased to Thirty, exclusive of those hired and
retained in his service who have served their terms. Should Mr.
MacArthur wish for an increase, they shall be assigned him when more
arrive from England; but your Lordship will observe by the number and
employment Return that the Public Labour absolutely necessary to be
carried on, and in which Agriculture on the part of the Crown is nearly
given up, will not allow of more Men being assigned at present until
more arrive.</p>

<p align="center">MACARTHUR'S OBSERVATIONS ON SHEEP-FARMING</p>

<p>A Report of the State of Mr. MacArthur's Flocks of Sheep, with some
observations on the Advantages which may be expected from the Growth of
fine Wool in New South Wales.</p>

<p class='right'>Paramatta, N.S.W., <i>2nd Oct., 1805.</i></p>

<p>The fine Woolled Sheep imported here from the Cape of Good Hope in
the Year 1797 were said to be of the Spanish Breed. The excellence of
the fleece of these Sheep combined with the consideration of their
peculiar form, bears strong evidence in favour of the Correctness of
this Report, tho' it is impossible to say whether they originally
sprung from the best kind of Sheep that is bred in Spain. Be this as it
may nothing is better established than that the Wool of this Breed of
Sheep has considerably improved in this Climate, and as Mr. MacArthur
has had the good fortune to bring out from England Four Rams and one
Ewe, purchased from His Majesty's Flock of Spanish Sheep, It is to be
hoped that these valuable animals will be the cause of a still further
Melioration in the Quality of our Wool. Indeed there appears no reason
to fear but that the Wool of this Country may by care and judicious
Management be placed on an equality with the very best that is grown in
Spain. It has been Mr. MacArthur's invariable practice to keep the
Spanish Breed apart from all others, and as fast as Spanish Rams have
been reared they have been put among the coarse-woolled Ewes. The
result of this system has proved extremely satisfactory, his Flocks now
consist of more than Five Thousand, of these Sixty are of the pure
Spanish kind, and the whole are much improved in the quality of the
Wool; he is of Opinion the best judge will be unable to discover any
material difference between the perfect and the mixed Breed in Seven
years.</p>

<p>With respect to Constitution, Size, and Aptitude to fatten, he has
tried all the Breeds he could obtain in the Colony, and he has found
the Spanish surpass them all in every one of these qualities. In the
representations that Mr. MacArthur had the honour to make in England to
His Majesty's Ministers, he stated that he thought a Flock of Sheep
would double itself in Two Years and a half, longer experience induces
him to think it may be done in rather less time; but in the Estimate he
now proposes to make, he will govern himself by the same data on which
his original Calculations were made, for he is desirous rather to
repress too sanguine Expectations than to encourage such as may prove
fallacious.</p>

<p>Estimating the Sheep in New South Wales at Twenty Thousand, a plain
Arithmetical progression will prove that the present Stock may increase
in Twenty Years to Five Millions, and calculating two pounds and a half
of clear washed Wool to each Sheep, they would produce almost twice as
much Wool as England now purchases from Spain at an Annual expense of
One Million Eight Hundred Thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Should Great Britain still require a much larger supply, Sheep can
be easily multiplied to any Extent in the immeasurable Forest which
Surrounds us.</p>

<p>It is difficult for the Mind to embrace all the Advantages which
must flow from the Successful Progression of this great National
Object; for if we contemplate the progress of the Cotton Manufactory we
shall see that at the commencement of the Eighteenth Century the
quantities of raw cotton imported into England did not exceed Two
Millions of Pounds weight. At this period it amounts to more than
Twenty Millions; and altho' its price has considerably advanced, yet
Manufactured Cotton Goods have fallen full Two Hundred per cent. This
prodigious diminution in price is attributable to no other cause than
the introduction of Machinery, by which the expense of Manual Labour is
comparatively reduced to nothing.</p>

<p>Now, repeated experiments have demonstrated that the same Machinery
is equally applicable to every Branch of the Woollen Manufactory, and
in truth it would long since have been adopted, but for the popular
Clamour that thousands of Labourers would be thrown out of employment.
"It cannot be denied," say its Opponents, "that Machinery would reduce
the price of Woollen, as it has done that of Cotton Cloths, but the two
Cases bear no Analogy, for when Machinery was applied in the
Manufacture of Cotton the increased Quantity of the raw material
furnished abundance of Employment in some other branch to those whose
Labour the Machine superseded. Make but the same experiment in the
Woollen Manufactory, and its fatal effects upon the poor will soon be
felt; for as you cannot increase the quantity of Animal Wool now being
brought into the Market, any Invention that has a tendency to diminish
Manual Labour is, and must be, pernicious."</p>

<p>This reasoning has had great weight on the Minds of best informed
Men; but if we can by our united Efforts (as assuredly we can) raise in
this Colony any Quantity of fine Wool, all its force would be at once
demolished. Whatever the demands of Great Britain may be for that
Commodity, we certainly may supply it. The universal use of Machinery
might then be safely sanctioned, and the British Manufacturers would be
enabled so to reduce the price of Woollen Cloths, as would assure
throughout the world the most Monopoly that any people ever possessed.
We also should largely participate in the profits of this gainful Trade
and should enjoy the pleasing Consolation that our Labours were
contributing to the Support and Prosperity of that parent Country to
whom our debt of Gratitude can never be paid.</p>

<p align="center">GOVERNOR MACQUARIE TO VISCOUNT CASTLEREAGH</p>

<p class='right'>Sydney, N.S.W., <i>30 April, 1810.</i></p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>I had the honour to address Your Lordship by Lieutenant-Colonel
Foveaux in a brief Despatch, under dates the eighth and twelfth of last
Month; but lest that Despatch may not get safe to Hand I shall in my
present one recapitulate the substance of my last, and furnish your
Lordship with a more detailed Account of my Proceedings.</p>

<p>I was very much surprised and concerned on my arrival here, at the
extraordinary and illiberal Policy I found had been adopted by all the
Persons who had preceded me in Office respecting those men who had been
originally sent out to this Country as Convicts, but who, by long
habits of Industry and total Reformation of Manners, had not only
become respectable, but by many degrees the most Useful Members of the
Community. Those persons have never been countenanced or received into
society. I have, nevertheless, taken upon Myself to adopt a new line of
conduct, Conceiving that Emancipation, when united with Rectitude and
long-tried good Conduct, should land a man back to that Rank in Society
which he had forfeited, and do away, in as far as the Case will admit,
all Retrospect of former bad Conduct. This appears to me to be the
greatest Inducement that can be held out towards the Reformation of the
Manners of the Inhabitants, and I think it is consistent with the
gracious and Humane Intentions of His Majesty and His Ministers in
favour of this class of people. I am aware it is a measure which must
be resorted to with great Caution and Delicacy; but I am hopeful that
in time it may be extended beyond the line within which I must restrict
myself for the present. The Number of Persons of this Description whom
I have yet admitted to my Table consist of only four. Namely: Mr.
D'Arcy Wentworth, Principal Surgeon; Mr. William Redfern, Assistant
Surgeon; Mr. Andrew Thompson, an opulent Farmer and Proprietor of Land;
and Mr. Simeon Lord, an opulent Merchant. Three of these Persons have
acquired Property to a large amount; they have long conducted
themselves with the greatest Propriety, and I find them at all times
ready to come forward in the most liberal manner to the assistance of
the Government. In order to mark my sense of the merits of Mr. Andrew
Thompson, I have already appointed him a Justice of the Peace and
Magistrate of the Hawkesbury, where he has a large property, and I
intend to confer the same Marks of Distinction on Mr. Wentworth and Mr.
Simeon Lord when Vacancies in the Magistracy at Sydney, where they both
reside, may occur.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this Despatch, permit me to express my grateful
acknowledgements to your Lordship for the Appointment I have now the
Honour to Hold, and to assure your Lordship that, as far as my
judgement and Abilities extend, I shall exert them in the faithful
discharge of the Trust reposed in me, with the Hope that in the wide
field for improvement here, my Services may not be unimportant, and
that they will ultimately meet with the Approbation of my Sovereign and
His Majesty's Ministers, and thereby Confirm the Opinion you did me the
Honour to form in my Favour.</p>

<p align="center">GOVERNOR MACQUARIE TO EARL OF LIVERPOOL</p>

<p class='right'>Sydney, N.S.W., <i>17th Nov., 1812.</i></p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>Since my last Public Despatch under Date 28th Oct. 1811, Transmitted
per ship Friends, via Rio-de-Janeiro, I have been honoured with Your
Lordship's Several Despatches, under Dates 26th July 1811, and 4th, 5th
and 19th May, 1812; and also the several other Letters with their
respective Enclosures and Accompanying Documents from Your Lordship or
the Under-Secretary of State, as noted in the margin.</p>

<p>In the first Despatch I had the Honour of addressing to Lord
Castlereagh (Your Lordship's immediate Predecessor in Office) under
date the 30th of April, 1810, I stated my Reasons for restoring those
Persons <i>who had been Convicts</i>, to that Rank in Society, which
they had lost, but which, by long habits of Rectitude and Meritorious
Conduct in this Colony they were fully entitled to be restored to. I
have found the greatest benefit to result from the adoption of this
System of Policy. Some Men who had been Convicts have been appointed
Magistrates by me; Some of the same Description of Men have been
honoured with His Majesty's Commission, which in my Mind is alone a
sufficient proof of the eligibility of these persons for any Society.
On all occasions I have found and experienced very great assistance
from those Persons in the Habitual and Zealous discharge of the Several
Duties attached to their respective Situations; and they act at all
times as if they conceived it to be their indispensable and first Duty
to assist the Government of the Country. Altho' the principal Leaders,
who headed the Faction which occasioned so much mischief and Anarchy in
this Country (previous to my arrival), have left it, Yet the Seeds of
it were so deeply sown that a considerable part of that factious spirit
still exists among some discontented and disaffected Persons in this
Colony, whose restless and Vicious Minds cannot endure any Control or
legitimate form of Government. The only measure of mine which to my
knowledge they have dared to attempt to counteract, is this extension
of just and humane Indulgence to those Persons (who had formerly been
Convicts), whom I have brought forward and patronised by admitting them
to my Society, but whom the factious Persons herein alluded to found it
advantageous to their Interests and illiberal Prejudices to consider as
Outcasts, beneath their notice and for ever doomed to oblivion and
Neglect.</p>

<p>It would therefore be highly gratifying and Satisfactory to Me, if
Your Lordship would have the goodness to honour me with a Communication
of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent's Sentiments on this Subject
which I consider as one of the greatest possible Interest and
Importance to the Welfare, Prosperity and Happiness of this rising
Colony; which, as it was originally settled for the Reception,
Punishment, and eventual Improvement of Convicts, appears to Me to
require that their Improvement, Welfare and Happiness should form the
first and chief Object of Attention in the important Duties entrusted
to the Governor of it.</p>

<p>This Despatch will be delivered to your Lordship by Lieutenant
Richard Lundin of the 73rd Regiment, to whom I take the liberty of
referring Your Lordship for any particulars relative to the Colony that
may have escaped my recollection in my Public Despatches; and I further
beg leave to recommend him to your Lordship's Favour and
Protection.</p>

<h2><a name="WESTERN_AUSTRALIA" id="WESTERN_AUSTRALIA"></a>WESTERN
AUSTRALIA</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;The State and Position of Western Australia, by
Captain Frederick Chidley Irwin of H.M. 63rd Regiment; late Commandant
of the Troops, and Acting Governor of the Colony, 1835, pp. 32-37,
42-46.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The settlement of Western Australia was undertaken in 1825, with the
purely philanthropic idea of relieving the overcrowded population of
Great Britain. The early difficulties were due to the ignorance of
conditions in the country, and the unsuitability of the emigrants. Mr.
Peel was chief promoter of the scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reader's attention will now be drawn to some of the
mis-statements with respect to the colony, which have appeared in
recent publications. Under this head he would especially notice a work
entitled "England and America." At page 33, Vol. 2 of the work in
question, there is said to be, in Western Australia "abundance of good
land and of land, too, cleared and drained by nature." After adverting
to the amount of capital and live stock, and the number of labourers
introduced by the first settlers, it is asked, what has become of all
that capital, and all those labourers? Then comes the following
passage: "Why this failure with all the elements of
success&mdash;plenty of good land, plenty of capital, and enough
labour? The explanation is easy: In this colony there never has been a
class of labourers. Those who went out as labourers no sooner reached
the colony than they were tempted by the superabundance of good land to
become landowners."</p>

<p>The writer proceeds to state, that Mr. Peel (who, as he had been
informed, had brought out a capital of &pound;50,000 and 300 persons of
the labouring class) had been thus left without a servant to make his
bed, or to fetch him water from the river; and that, in the absence of
his people, his capital had perished. "The same thing," he adds,
"happened in many cases." Further on, it is stated that some of the
labourers, who had become independent landowners, died of hunger, at a
period when a large supply of food had reached the colony, and that
they were starved because where they had settled was not known to the
Governor, nor even to themselves&mdash;"such," says this writer, "was
the dispersion of these colonists, in consequence of superabundance of
good land." It is added, that the settlers who remained had petitioned
for convicts, though one of the chief inducements to settling in the
colony was an undertaking, on the part of the English Government, that
none should be sent thither.</p>

<p>If this writer's statement be correct, that labourers on their
arrival, tempted by the superabundance of good land, did with impunity
desert their masters, leaving their property to perish, and did
themselves become landowners, it will be apparent, either that there
were then no laws in the colony, or that they were not in force. The
reverse, however, is the fact&mdash;there were laws, and they were
enforced.</p>

<p>The following is No. 8 of the land regulations: "No grant of land
will be made to servants under indenture; nor shall persons receive
grants who shall appear to have come to the settlement at the expense
of other individuals without sufficient assurance of their having
fulfilled the condition of any agreement under which they may have
come." The author does not remember an instance of this regulation
being relaxed; and it is manifest that destruction of property and the
ruin of the capitalist must have been inevitable, had the Government
not enforced it.</p>

<p>Equally without foundation is the statement that the indentured
servant could desert his master with impunity. The indenture was
binding equally on master and servant, and was strictly enforced by the
colonial law. If the master failed to give the wages, food, or whatever
else might have been stipulated for in the indenture, the servant, on
establishing his complaint before a magistrate, obtained his discharge.
On the other hand, if the master proved a breach of the indenture by
the servant unduly absenting himself, refusing to work, etc., the
magistrate was under obligation to imprison the servant. Also any
person employing an indentured servant, without permission of the
master, was subject to a very heavy fine.</p>

<p>Mr. Peel and his people were in this manner circumstanced. The
author has read many of their indentures; in all of these Mr. Peel was
bound to pay them daily wages (generally three shillings) out of which
their food and clothing were to be deducted. The capital imported by
Mr. Peel, though very considerable, was understood to consist chiefly
of stores and live-stock. However this may have been, he found it
convenient after a time, to grant most of his people permission to work
for other settlers, reserving a right to recall them when he chose; but
allowing them the alternative of their discharge, on their reimbursing
him the expense of their passage out. As his people could get higher
wages when working for others, they gladly accepted the permission.
Occasional misunderstandings took place between him and some of them,
and it was not till after the Governor, accompanied by the Law-Adviser
of Government, had more than once repaired in person to Mr. Peel's
location, that an adjustment of those differences was effected. The
author has known several servants of Mr. Peel to be imprisoned for
breaches of indenture. A number of them, however, were excellent men,
who would have conscientiously adhered to him, had he not given them
the option of working for others.</p>

<p>It is but justice here to acknowledge the great benefit conferred on
the settlement by Mr. Peel, in the introduction of men who were not
only of good conduct, but well acquainted with farming pursuits or with
trades. For himself, the author feels happy in having this opportunity
to express his sense of it, having had upwards of four years in his
service, a family brought out by Mr. Peel. The father of this family is
a man of intelligence and observation. Besides his own trade of brick
and tile-making, he has a complete knowledge of farming, gardening,
bricklaying, lime-burning, and brewing, in which various occupations he
employs himself. Such is his industry that he has been seen working for
hours in the garden by moonlight, after spending a long day at labour
in the field. His wife is a regular dairywoman. One of the sons is a
carpenter, and another a ploughman, besides having each a knowledge of
their father's trade; and the rest of the family, down to the youngest,
are training up habits of industry and labour.</p>

<p>Although, as has been shown, the conditions of the indentures were
by the colonial laws enforced, it will nevertheless be manifest, that
no law, in any country, can prevent an artful and unprincipled servant
(anxious to be rid of his engagement) from acting in so vexatious a
manner, that some masters, in preference to keeping such a one, would
forgo any benefit the indenture might offer. Such a course has been
adopted in the colony by some masters thus circumstanced. Those,
however, who had been careful to bring out men of good character, and
to whom they allowed an equitable compensation for their services, have
rarely had cause for complaint; and, on the contrary, have generally
been rewarded by the cheerful obedience of their servants.</p>

<p>The author is the more desirous of disproving the alleged lawless
state of society in the colony, as the implied reproach is totally
unmerited by the Governor, Sir James Stirling, who has been most
indefatigable and self-denying in his exertions for the public welfare;
and it is equally so by the magistracy, who have, from the outset,
administered the laws with vigour and impartiality.</p>

<p>With reference to the assertion that some individuals had perished
with hunger from not having been able to inform the Governor as to
where they had settled, the author can only say, that he did not hear
of any such circumstance while in the colony, and that he considers it
very improbable; as, with the exception of the people connected with
Mr. Peel, the settlers at the period alluded to were located on the
Swan and the Canning, by following down which rivers they could have
reached in the course of a single day the towns of Perth or
Freemantle.</p>

<p>He has also to confess his ignorance of the colonists having, as
stated, petitioned for convicts&mdash;he knows that such a wish was not
expressed in their memorial drawn up in 1832, and laid before His
Majesty's Government by Sir James Stirling in person. The colonists
having had before their eyes, in the neighbouring penal settlements,
the serious evils inflicted on society by the employment of convicts
(especially as indoor servants) have firmly resisted the temptation to
seek such a remedy for their wants. The extreme difficulty, which it is
notorious respectable families there experience, to sufficiently guard
the morals of their offspring, and to secure their being brought up in
the necessary principles of virtue and integrity, is alone a
consideration which, it is believed, will keep the colonists in Western
Australia stedfast on that point. No mere worldly prosperity whatsoever
can compensate for the tremendous risk to which children in a penal
settlement are exposed, as many a heart-broken parent can testify.</p>

<p>It now remains for the author to offer a few observations</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. On the failures that occurred among the early settlers.</p>

<p>2. On the origin of the reports so widely circulated to the
prejudice of the country.</p>

<p>3. On the tardy progress of the colony, compared with what had been
expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following extract from one of the earliest despatches of the
Governor (written in January 1830, and addressed to the Secretary of
State) will serve to preface these remarks, as it bears immediately on
the first point. Adverting to the circumstances under which the first
settlers came out, he thus proceeds: "There could not be a great number
with minds and bodies suited to encounter the struggle and distresses
of a new settlement. Many, if not all, have accordingly been more or
less disappointed on arrival, with either the state of things here, or
their own want of power to surmount the difficulties pressing round
them. This has been experienced, in the beginning, by every new colony;
and might have been expected to occur here, as well as elsewhere. The
greater part, incapable of succeeding in England, are not likely to
prosper here to the extent of their groundless and inconsiderate
expectations. Many of the settlers who have come should never have left
in England a safe and tranquil state of life; and, if it be possible to
discourage one set of people, and to encourage another, I would
earnestly request that for a few years, the helpless and inefficient
may be kept from the settlement; whilst, as to the active, industrious,
and intelligent they may be assured with confidence of a fair reward
for their labours."</p>

<p>If, after what has been said, it be granted that Western Australia,
as far as natural advantages go, is well suited for the purpose of
colonization, still it will be apparent, from the principle on which
the colony was founded, that its success must be greatly dependent on
the capital and exertions of the settlers. The charge of maintaining a
military and a civil establishment being all His Majesty's Government
was pledged to, every other expense was to be borne by the emigrant;
such as his outfit, voyage, and settlement in the colony.</p>

<p>No arrangement prior to leaving England having been made by the
emigrants to ensure the advantages of co-operation on the part of their
friends at home, and among themselves in the colony, each depended on
his own energy and resources for his success; and the foregoing
description of many of the original settlers will account for the
disappointments that ensued in various instances.</p>

<p>Few who abandoned the settlement under such circumstances, were
willing to admit their failure was the result of their own want of
exertion, or their unfitness for the enterprise in which they had
embarked; accordingly, wherever they went, and in their letters home,
the blame was laid on the country. Thus many of the evil reports
respecting it, which were current at home and in the neighbouring
colonies, may be traced to this source.</p>

<p>A prevalent cause of distress among the early settlers arose from
their having generally brought out with them little ready money,
compared with their other property. This was chiefly owing to the
Government regulations admitting of land being assigned to those only
who introduced labourers, and various kinds of property required by
farmers. Many of the settlers, therefore, to the extent of their means,
were in this way amply provided; but having understood in England that
money would be of little use in a new country, numbers, without
questioning what they wished to be true, incautiously expended most of
their means in the property that would entitle them to obtain land in
the colony. However, when they had been some time in the settlement,
they discovered that there, as in other places, money was needful; and
on wishing to procure some by the sale of part of their property, they
found it difficult to do so without loss, in consequence of most other
settlers having brought out similar investments.</p>

<p>Another cause of depression, which has borne seriously on the
settlers, has been the occasional high price of the necessaries of
life. With a view of remedying this evil, cargoes of provisions have
been repeatedly imported by the Local Government&mdash;the actual cost
alone being charged to the settler. Even a shipload of bullocks and
pigs was introduced from Java. But, numbers of the bullocks and pigs
getting loose, soon became as wild and difficult to recapture as if
they had been natives of the woods, whither they had betaken
themselves.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the system of free grants, which was the
first adopted in Western Australia, is decidedly injurious to the
prosperity of a settlement, from the facility it affords to persons
possessed of comparatively little capital to acquire extensive tracts
of land, the greater part of which, for want of means, they cannot use
for agricultural or pastoral purposes. It also occasions the too wide
dispersion of the settlers; thus necessarily increasing the expense of
Government, and, at the same time, producing serious inconvenience to
the farmer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The failure of the first attempt to settle Western Australia gave
rise to much thought upon the theory of colonization. The ideas most
generally accepted were those of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who
summarized his theory as follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">OUTLINE OF A SYSTEM OF COLONIZATION</p>

<p>It is suggested:</p>

<p align="center">Article I.</p>

<p>THAT a payment in money of&mdash;&mdash; per acre, be required for
all future grants of land without exception.</p>

<p align="center">Article II.</p>

<p>THAT all land now granted, and to be granted, throughout the colony,
be declared liable to a tax of&mdash;&mdash; per cent. upon the actual
rent.</p>

<p align="center">Article III.</p>

<p>THAT the proceeds of the tax upon rent, and of sales, form an
EMIGRATION FUND, to be employed in the conveyance of British labourers
to the colony free of cost.</p>

<p align="center">Article IV.</p>

<p>THAT those to whom the administration of the Fund shall be
entrusted, be empowered to raise money on that security, as money is
raised on the security of parish and county rates in England.</p>

<p align="center">Article V.</p>

<p>THAT the supply of labourers be as nearly as possible proportioned
to the demand for Labour at each Settlement; so that Capitalists shall
never suffer from an urgent want of Labourers, and that Labourers shall
never want well-paid employment.</p>

<p align="center">Article VI.</p>

<p>THAT in the selection of Emigrants, an absolute preference be given
to young persons, but that no excess of males be conveyed to the colony
free of cost.</p>

<p align="center">Article VII.</p>

<p>THAT Colonists providing a passage for emigrant Labourers, being
young persons, and equal numbers of both sexes, be entitled to a
payment in money from the Emigration Fund, equal to the actual contract
price of a passage for so many labouring persons.</p>

<p align="center">Article VIII.</p>

<p>THAT Grants be absolute in fee, without any condition whatever, and
obtainable by deputy.</p>

<p align="center">Article IX.</p>

<p>THAT any surplus of the proceeds of the tax upon rent and of sales,
over what is required for Emigration, be employed in relief of other
taxes, and for the general purposes of Colonial Government.</p>

(J. Horton James, 1839), pp. 1, 28-37</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The settlement of South Australia was undertaken to test Wakefield's
theory; but instead of turning their land to good account the colonists
left it idle, hoping to sell at a high price. The result was
disastrous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">SITUATION AND EXTENT</p>

<p>The New Province, called South Australia, which, by an Act of the
Imperial Parliament, was erected into a free British colony on 15th
August, 1834, is situate on the South Coast of the Great Island
Continent of New Holland, in the Southern or Indian Ocean, extending
from 132&deg; to 141&deg; E. longitude, and from 38&deg; to 26&deg; S.
latitude, and contains nearly two hundred millions of acres. It is
twelve thousand miles distant from Great Britain.</p>

<p>This distance of twelve thousand miles ought to be performed by a
fast sailing ship in twelve weeks, at the rate of a thousand miles per
week, which is the fair average running of a good ship on distant
voyages; but it is better to allow something for light winds and calms
near the Equator, and to say in round numbers one hundred days in all,
which is rather more than fourteen weeks.</p>

<p>This is Port Adelaide! Port Misery would be a better name; for
nothing in any other part of the world can surpass it in everything
that is wretched and inconvenient, packages of goods and heaps of
merchandise are lying about in every direction as if they had cost
nothing. Stacks of what were once beautiful London bricks crumbling
away like gingerbread, and evidently at each returning tide half
covered with the flood; trusses of hay, now rotten, and Norway deals,
scattered about as if they had no owner&mdash;iron ploughs and rusty
harrows&mdash;cases of door-frames and windows that had once been
glazed&mdash;heaps of the best slates half tumbling
down&mdash;winnowing-machines broken to pieces&mdash;blocks of Roman
cement, now hard as stone, wanting nothing but the staves and
hoops&mdash;Sydney cedar, and laths and shingles from Van Diemen's Land
in every direction; whilst on the high ground are to be seen pigs
eating through the flour-sacks, and kegs of raisins with not only the
head out, but half the contents; onions and potatoes apparently to be
had for picking up. The sight is disheartening. What with the sun and
the rain&mdash;the sand and the floods&mdash;the thieves with four legs
and the thieves with two&mdash;the passengers hug themselves at the
recollection that <i>they</i> have brought no merchandise for sale,
glad enough to be able to take care of themselves. The sooner they get
out of this horrid hole the better, so they enquire if there is any
coach to the town&mdash;they are answered by a careless shake of the
head, and so, like good settlers, they determine to set off and walk,
carrying their light parcels with them, and leaving the heavy things
with a friend who refuses to go any further. They ask for a drink of
water before starting&mdash;there is not such a thing to be had; but
the bullock carts are expected down every minute with the usual supply!
"What, no water?" exclaims our passenger. "No, sir, but the
Commissioners are sinking a well, though they have not yet found any
but salt water; but they are going to dig in another place, shortly, we
understand."</p>

<p>Away they start for the City of Adelaide, and after ten minutes of
rough walking through the loose sand, which is fatiguing enough, they
gain the firm and beaten road, with the cheerful hills before them,
glad enough to have overcome their morning troubles. Though very warm
the walk is agreeable, and out of a cloud of dust before them, they
soon descry a dray or two, each drawn by a long line of bullocks. They
perceive by the splashing of the water from the open bungs that the
casks contain the daily supply for the port, and the drivers very
cheerfully give them all a drink; this enables them to walk on with
renewed spirits, over the naked plain, and, tired and dusty, in about
seven miles more they reach another iron store, the property of the
Commissioners, where they now begin to see a few marquees and huts, and
people walking about. They step across the "Torrens," without knowing
it, and enquire for the inn. They are directed to the Southern Cross
Hotel, then kept by a German Jew of the name of Levy, considered the
best house in this settlement, and here we will leave them for the
present, hungry, thirsty, and fatigued&mdash;covered with dust and
perspiration&mdash;and with feelings of shame and disappointment at
being so taken in!</p>

<p align="center">CITY OF ADELAIDE.</p>

<p>"When things are at the worst, they mend," is a common saying, and a
true one; and so it was with our passengers. Though rough, dirty and
uncomfortable, they enjoyed the Jew's dinner or table d'h&ocirc;te,
though it consisted merely of a baked leg of mutton at the top, with a
baked shoulder at bottom and a dish of small potatoes in the
middle&mdash;nothing else whatever&mdash;neither pie, pudding, or
cheese; but they had given themselves a good wash, and a change of
linen, and a bottle of Barclay and Perkins at dinner had now restored
them to good humour.</p>

<p>They found that the company at the table was much better than the
dishes, and that they had all gone through the same miserable landing
at the Fort, and some of them had even suffered considerably by falling
down in the mud; so, as we draw comfort out of other men's misfortunes,
and it is better to laugh than weep, our newly-arrived emigrants began
to think the place was not so bad after all. They were, at any rate,
great travellers, and were determined to make light of troubles and
inconveniences, as all travellers do. They saw that the gentlemen at
table were a very nice set of fellows, and as they had evidently had to
rough it, much more formerly, than was necessary at the present day,
they should make up their minds to think well of everything&mdash;to
look only at the advantages of the Colony&mdash;and in their letters to
any London friends, they were resolved decidedly to recommend the
place&mdash;but not a word about the mud.</p>

<p>The Town of Adelaide, as depicted on the maps, is the very beau
ideal of all possible cities&mdash;there is an elegance and vastness of
design about it, that almost makes one blush for the comparative
insignificance of London and Stromboul; of Paris and Canton;&mdash;but
on going to the spot, like many other works of art and imagination, it
resembles the picture very slightly&mdash;it is altogether on too large
a scale; and of all the follies committed by the inexperience of the
surveyor-general, who is, nevertheless, in every other respect a most
gentlemanlike, entertaining, and intelligent person, next to its inland
situation, this monstrous extent of Adelaide will turn out to be the
most fruitful of complaints. You may lean against any tree in the City
and exclaim, "This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods, I better brook
than flourishing peopled towns."</p>

<p>And yet there are sprinkled up and down the place a few substantial
buildings; one belonging to the Company, on an enormous
scale&mdash;another good brick house to Mr. Hack&mdash;another to the
enterprising Mr. Gilles&mdash;one to Mr. Thomas, and a couple of new
taverns. The rest of the dwellings are made of very slight materials,
and the number of canvas tents and marquees give some parts of the
settlement the appearance of a camp. Most of the new-comers settle down
on what is called the Park Lands, where they are handy to the little
rivulet, and they run up a Robinson Crusoe sort of hut, with twigs and
branches from the adjoining forest, and the climate being fine and dry,
they answer well enough as temporary residences. The principal streets
have been laid out in the survey of the town 132 feet wide, which is
nearly twice as wide as Portland Place, and the squares are all on such
a scale of magnitude, that if there were any inhabitants in them, a cab
would almost be required to get across them.</p>

<p>Before any person has been ashore at Adelaide twenty-four hours,
even the greenest and most inexperienced put these two very natural
questions; First&mdash;Why did you make the plan of the future town so
large? Answer&mdash;Because the land was of no value, and it was a pity
to be crowded when there was so much room! And the Second question
is&mdash;Why did you select the town eight miles from the
landing-place? Answer&mdash;Because we preferred being away from the
nasty sailors, and thought it better not to be annoyed with the
demoralizing influence of a Sea Port!</p>

<p>Unless this is promptly remedied, the "Wisdom of our ancestors" will
not become such a favourite saying in South Australia, as it is in the
Old Country, for the town, including the park lands, is already eight
miles round, with 3,000 inhabitants only. This, from persons who are
all for concentration, seems strange; and the consequence is as might
have been expected, that in the daytime persons are constantly losing
themselves in the midst of the city. Whilst at night it is impossible
to move out of the house without company, unless you have any desire to
sleep under a tree. This has happened to the oldest inhabitants, about
whom many droll stories have been told. Some of the highest officers in
the colony, after wandering about for hours in the dark, either running
against trees, or falling over logs, or into holes, have chosen rather
to give it up in despair, content to take a night's lodging beneath a
tree, than run the risk any longer of breaking their necks although in
the midst of the township, and when day-light appeared, not perhaps
more than a pistol-shot from their own hut. It is hardly possible that
such a blunder as this is, this Adelaide and Port Adelaide, can much
longer be tolerated by the respectable parties about proceeding to the
Colony, and there is not the remotest chance that the unnatural
abortion can ever come to good. Another town of more modest and
moderate pretensions will rise up in the land-locked basin of Port
Lincoln, along the margin of the deep water, consisting of 640 acres,
divided into building lots of one rood each, which will be enough for a
population of 50,000 persons, which is as many as the most sanguine
friend of the Colony can anticipate for a century to come. There, under
the shelter of Boston Island, or in Spalding Cove, the merchant may
leave his office and walk across a plank into the last ship that
arrived from England, and all the hundreds of bullocks now employed
dragging up waggon loads of rubbish and merchandise from Adelaide Swamp
to Adelaide Township, may then be dispensed with and go a-ploughing, as
they ought to have done long since, which will save &pound;20,000 a
year to the settlers in the item of land carriage alone, and by being
employed on the farms instead of on the road the Colony will not
require such frequent importations of farm produce from Van Diemen's
Land, to the great impoverishment of the community. What, abandon
Adelaide! I think I hear the carriers exclaim. Oh no, let Adelaide
remain as before, it will always answer well enough for a country
village, and stand a monument to the folly of the projectors, but let
the Governor and Civil Establishment move their head-quarters without
loss of time, to Port Lincoln, before more money is thrown away. Every
month that this measure is delayed it is made more difficult and
therefore should not be postponed at all. The buyers of the 1,200 town
acres would feel much disappointment at the measure, as the market
would be spoiled for the sale of their building lots, but they would be
rightly served for asking a monopoly price to respectable new-comers,
who ought to be enabled to obtain a town allotment for a trifle of the
Government.</p>

<p>In New South Wales they are sold by auction as applied for, and put
up at 20<i>s.</i> each, at which price they are generally knocked down;
but with a view to prevent any monopolizer buying them up, to the
injury of the <i>bona fide</i> settler, every purchaser must sign a
bond to the Government in a penalty of &pound;20, that he will build a
house on the allotment, of a certain value, within three years, or
otherwise the land reverts absolutely to the Crown, and the penalty is
enforced too. This is as it should be, and the evil working of the old
system ought to have been forseen, but at South Australia the
Commissioners and Survey Department disdained to copy anything from
such a colony as Sydney and made the old saying good about advice, that
those who want it most like it least. Now the late Governor, Captain
Hindmarsh, was quite the opposite of this, and was most diligent in
seeking out the best way of doing everything, and was not above
learning even from those ignorant neighbours, New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land. Here is a proof.</p>

<p class='right'>"Government House, <i>25th April, 1838.</i></p>

<p>"The Council being about to meet this morning to discuss a subject
with which Mr. Horton James is particularly well acquainted; the
Governor will thank Mr. James, if he would do him the favour to attend
the Council this morning about half-past nine o'clock, to give the
Council his opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>"T.H. JAMES, ESQ., Adelaide."</p>

<p>The character of the late Governor, Capt. Hindmarsh, pleased me
exceedingly, not only for the frankness of his manner towards
strangers, and the easy terms on which he admitted every respectable
resident to his table, but by his constant, steady, and unremitting
attention to business. Many difficulties of a new and serious nature
would sometimes suddenly involve him, during my residence in the
colony, especially in reference to the native blacks, who had been
committing some violences in the camp. The settlers were very violent
and rash, calling loudly for immediate and strong measures of
retaliation, and going up in mobs to Government House, thirsting for
revenge against the natives. But the Governor on all occasions acted
with a praiseworthy and becoming firmness, and would listen to nothing
like reprisals on an unarmed and naked population; and while he took
the most upright, they turned out to be the wisest and most successful
measures he could have adopted for the pacification of the place, which
in a day or two became as quiet as ever, and the danger so much talked
of was disregarded and forgotten, entirely owing to His Excellency's
pacific treatment. Notwithstanding his severe and inflexible adherence
to these measures, in accordance to his instructions, and in opposition
to the murderous wishes of some of the settlers, Captain Hindmarsh,
after the hours of business, surrounded by his amiable and accomplished
family, was just the same as ever, zealous, enthusiastic and humane,
when speaking of the colony and its black population; and gentle and
sincere in his intercourse with his friends; never exhibiting the
slightest degree of reserve, parade or affectation, but winning all
hearts by his attention to his guests. It is hard to say why such a
suitable person was recalled. He seems to have been sacrificed to
clamour; but to accuse, and prove, are very different, and in any
enquiry that may be hereafter instituted, Captain Hindmarsh will, I am
sure, come off without reproach.</p>

<p><i>May 29th.</i> Daylight had no sooner broke this morning&mdash;and
never had its cheerful return been so ardently longed for&mdash;than we
were again greeted by the sight of Port Phillip Heads, at a distance
not apparently exceeding eight miles. By 9 a.m. we were between the
Heads, with the tide running out, and nearly at low water; a heavy surf
and the wind light and baffling. We effected an entrance with
difficulty at a part of the bay where the width was about a mile and a
quarter. We succeeded, however, in entering one of the finest bays, or
basins of water, well sheltered, that we remember to have seen. Within
the Bay the water was, compared to our late tossing in the boiling and
foaming waters outside, as smooth as a mill-pond, and our little bark
floated gently along like a sleeping gull. I shall, however, take this
opportunity to remark that it will be desirable to enter its mouth only
at the times of the tide running in. We continued our course down the
bay, and found the country everywhere of the same richly-grassed
character.</p>

<p><i>May 30th.</i> Robinson Crusoe was never better pleased with the
appearance of the first ship which arrived, and rescued him <i>from</i>
his desolate island, than I was with the vessel which proved the means
of thus opening to view a country capable of supporting a future
nation, and which, we trust, will be the means of relieving the Hobart
Town country of its over-stocked cattle, and the Mother Country of her
surplus and half-starved peasantry. Futurity must develop this
prophecy! Further travelling and examination only added to my
pre-conceived estimate of this extremely interesting and extensive
territory; consisting of plains or downs at least twenty miles long by
a width of 10 miles, and the distance may have been greater, but for
the interruption of hills more than ordinarily high, which broke the
horizon in different directions. One of these vistas, which I have at
present in view, cannot form a less area than 100,000 acres. Its
general character presents that of cultivated pasture for centuries
past; the few trees appear as though they owed their plantation to the
hand of man. All the high hills are covered with grass to their
summits.</p>

<p>I discovered the fires of the natives or aboriginal inhabitants of
this marvellously fertile country, and felt delighted beyond expression
that the task of its discovery should have devolved upon myself.</p>

<p><i>June 2nd.</i> My Sydney natives came on board this morning for
the purpose of assisting in packing up, and otherwise making
preparations for our contemplated expedition into the interior. As it
continued to rain heavily and a heavy bank of fog prevailed, and
prevented our seeing any distance, I proposed, rather than lose time to
go with the vessel to the river (Saltwater), and from thence take my
departure for the bush. We made the river by 3 p.m., and observed that
the whole of the coast at the head of the bay was clear of timber, and
a constant plain covered with grass.</p>

<p>Near the head of the river, on the point, was a plantation of
she-oak. We endeavoured to sail up the river, but found the water not
more than a fathom deep.... To-morrow, weather permitting, I intend
taking my departure up the river.</p>

<p><i>June 3rd.</i> Everything being in readiness, we left the vessel
about 9 a.m., and proceeded in a boat up the river for about five
miles.... In travelling further up we passed over several rich flats,
about a mile wide, by two or three miles long, destitute of trees, and
covered knee-deep with grass, from which hundreds of tons of good hay
might be made. The land was of the best description, equal to anything
in the world, nor does it appear subject to being flooded. For
twenty-six miles we continued following the course of this river, and
found on both sides of it, as far as the eye could stretch, fine open
plains, with a few trees of the oak species; one striking object was
the absence of fresh water all throughout this distance. Just before
sundown as we were preparing to camp on the bank of the river, I caught
sight of a damp place, and, on sending one of my men, Gumm, to make a
hole with a stick to the depth of two feet, we had in the course of an
hour a plentiful supply of good water.... I have named this place
Gumm's Well.</p>

<p><i>June 4th.</i> Recommenced our journey up the river at 8 a.m.;
after travelling four or five miles, I turned off to obtain a view of
Mounts Collicott, Cottrill, and Solomon.... We continued travelling
over the plains, and in eight miles again made the river. Having
crossed the river, we travelled over the richest land I had ever seen
in my life; marsh mallows with leaves as large as those of the cabbage
tribe, and as high as my head. We recrossed at a native ford, and we
observed on a wattle tree, which they had been stripping of the bark,
scratches or marks of figures, representing blacks in the act of
fighting. These figures I copied as near as I was able.</p>

<p><i>June 6th.</i> We made an early breakfast and resumed our journey
in order to reach the camp of the blacks, the smoke of whose fires we
had seen yesterday. We travelled over land equal to any that we had
seen, a deep black diluvium with grass three or four feet high, and
thinly-timbered. After travelling eight miles we struck the trail of
the natives which in a short time led us to a branch of the tribe,
consisting of one chief, his wife, and three children&mdash;fine,
plump, chubby, healthy-looking urchins they were. To this distinguished
royal chieftain of the prairies I gave one pair of blankets,
handkerchiefs, beads, and three pocket-knives; upon the receipt of
these presents, he undertook the part of guide. We crossed a fresh
water creek with good land on either bank. Our new guide informed us
that he would take us to his tribe, at the same time naming many of
their chiefs. After travelling about eight miles, we were surprised to
hear a number of voices calling after us, and on looking round
encountered six men, armed with spears fixed in their wommeras. We
stopped; and they at once threw aside their spears, and came up to us
in a most friendly manner possible. We all shook hands and I gave them
knives, tomahawks, etc., whereupon they took the lead, and brought us
back about a mile, to where we found huts, or gunyahs, and a number of
women and children. We sat down in the midst of these sooty and sable
aboriginal children of Australia; amongst whom we ascertained were
eight chiefs belonging to the country near Port Phillip, over which we
had travelled, and with which we had so much reason to be pleased. The
three principal chiefs were brothers. Two of them were fully six feet
high and tolerably good-looking; the third was not so tall but much
stouter than the others. The other five chiefs were equally fine men.
And a question, to myself, here arises, and the answer as speedily
follows, viz., now is the time for entering into and effecting a
purchase of their land. A full explanation, that my object in visiting
their shores was to purchase their land, they appeared to understand;
and the following negotiation or agreement was immediately entered
into. I purchased two large blocks or tracts of land, about 600,000
acres, more or less, and, in consideration therefor, I gave them
blankets, knives, looking-glasses, tomahawks, beads, scissors, flour,
etc. I also further agreed to pay them a tribute or rent yearly. The
parchment, or deed was signed this afternoon by the eight chiefs, each
of them, at the same time, handing me a portion of the soil; thus
giving me full possession of the tracts of land I had purchased.</p>

<p>This most extraordinary sale and purchase took place by the side of
a lovely stream of water, from whence my land commenced. A tree was
here marked in four different ways, to define the corner boundaries.
Good land, to any extent, either for stock or tillage, with good water
was here in abundance, ready for sheep, cattle, or the plough. Our
negotiation was terminated by my Sydney natives giving our
newly-acquired friends a grand corroborree at night, much to their
delight. The group consisted, altogether, of forty-five men, women, and
children.</p>

<p>Sunday, <i>June 7th.</i> I awoke this morning with the agreeable
consciousness of my being able, like Alexander Selkirk, of school-boy
memory, to say: "I am monarch of all I survey; my right there is none
to dispute." With a view, however, of securing this right more
permanently, I busied myself with drawing up triplicates of the deeds
of the land I had purchased, and in delivering over to the natives more
property. This was done on the banks of the lovely little creek which I
have named Batman's Creek, as a memento of the novel and interesting
transaction occurring on its banks. After the purchase and payment at
the conclusion of the preliminaries, I had made preparation for
departing, when two of the principal chiefs approached, and laid their
royal mantles at my feet, begging my acceptance of them. Upon my
acquiescing, the gifts were placed around my neck and over my shoulders
by the noble donors, who seemed much pleased at their share in the
transaction, and begged of me to walk a pace or two in their (now my)
princely vestments. I asked them to accompany me to the vessel, to
which request I received a rather feeling reply, by their pointing,
first to their children, and next to their own naked feet, importing
that they could not walk so fast as ourselves, but would come down in a
few day. In the course of the late transaction, I had no difficulty in
discovering their sacred and private mark, so important in all their
transactions, and universally respected. I obtained a knowledge of this
mark by means of one of my Sydney natives, Bungit, who, going behind a
tree, out of sight of the females made the Sydney aboriginal mark. I
afterwards took two others of my natives, and the principal chief of
Port Phillip to whom I showed the mark on the tree, which he instantly
recognized, and pointed, also, to the knocking out of the front tooth.
This mark is always made simultaneously with the loss or extraction of
the tooth. I requested the chief through the interpretation of my
Sydney natives, to give the imprint of his mark. After a few minutes
hesitation, he took a tomahawk and did as he was desired, on the bark
of a tree. A copy of this mark is attached to the deed, as the
signature and seal of their country.</p>

<p>About 10 a.m. I took my departure from these interesting people. The
principal chief could not be less than six feet four inches high, and
his proportions gigantic; his brother six feet two inches, also a fine
man. I recrossed Batman's Creek, and travelled over thinly-timbered
country of box, gum, wattle, and she-oak, with grass three of four feet
high. Travelling twelve miles down we came, subsequently, upon a
thinly-timbered forest of gum, wattle and oak. Here, for the first
time, the land became sandy, with a little gravel. The grass was ten
inches high, and resembled a field of wheat. We have not seen the
slightest appearance of frost. After leaving this forest, we came upon
the river I had gone up a few days before. Intending to come down on
the opposite side and hail the vessel, I crossed on the banks of the
river, a large marsh, one mile and a half broad by three or four long,
of the richest diluvium; not a tree was to be seen. Having crossed this
marsh we passed through a dense tea-tree scrub, very high, expecting to
make the vessel in the course of an hour or two, but, to our great
surprise, when we got through, we found ourselves on the banks of a
much larger river than the one we had originally gone up.</p>

<p>As it was now near sundown, and at least two days would be required
to head the river, I decided upon allowing two of my Sydney natives to
swim across it, and go to the vessel, distant about seven miles, to
fetch the boat. Bullet and Bungit started on this enterprise, and
returned in about three hours from the time of their departure. Their
return with the boat was most opportune as we had got on the point of
junction of the two rivers, where the tide had set in, and was already
up to my ankles. I first despatched the party with the dogs in the boat
to the opposite bank, and, on the return of the boat, myself and old
Bull, who had cut his foot, went in first-rate style, to the vessel. I
hope my travelling on foot will terminate, at least for some time. I
had now accomplished a most arduous undertaking, and, in order to
secure the fruits of my exertions I intend leaving Gumm, Dodds,
Thomson, and three of my Sydney natives&mdash;Bungit, Bullet, and old
Bull&mdash;as overseers and bailiffs of my newly acquired territory,
and of the possession of which nothing short of a premature disclosure
of my discovery on the part of my companions, can possibly deprive me.
These people I intend leaving at Indented Heads, as my head depot, with
a supply of necessaries for at least three months. The chiefs of the
Port Phillip tribe made me a present of three stone tomahawks, some
spears, wommeras, boomerangs, and other weapons of warfare.</p>

<p><i>June 8th.</i> This morning the winds set in foul for Indented
Heads, and, having made several attempts to get out of the river, we
gave it up as hopeless. We went in the boat, up the large river coming
from the east, and after examination six miles up, I was pleased to
find the water quite fresh and very deep. This will be the place for
the future village.</p>

<h2><a name="TRANSPORTATION" id=
"TRANSPORTATION"></a>TRANSPORTATION</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Report from the Select Committee of the House
of Commons on Transportation (Molesworth, 1838), pp. 8-10, 31-33,
43</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Australia was shown to offer greater and greater attractions to
free settlers the agitation against transportation increased. In 1838
the British Government appointed a Select Committee to inquire into and
report upon the whole system. Their verdict is given below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To plant a colony, and to form a new society, has ever been an
arduous task. In addition to the natural difficulties arising from
ignorance of the nature of the soil, and of the climate of a new
country, the first settlers have generally had to contend with
innumerable obstacles, which only undaunted patience, firmness of mind,
and constancy of purpose, could overcome. But, whatever the amount of
difficulties attendant on the foundations of colonies, those
difficulties were greatly augmented, in New South Wales, by the
character of the first settlers. The offenders who were transported in
the past century to America, were sent to communities the bulk of whose
population were men of thrift and probity; the children of improvidence
were dropped in by driblets amongst the mass of a population already
formed, and were absorbed and assimilated as they were dropped in. They
were scattered and separated from each other; some acquired habits of
honest industry, and all, if not reformed by their punishment, were not
certain to be demoralized by it. In New South Wales, on the contrary,
the community was composed of the very dregs of society; of men, proved
by experience to be unfit to be at large in any society, and who were
sent from the British gaols, and turned loose to mix with one another
in the desert, together with a few task-masters, who were to set them
to work in the open wilderness; and with the military, who were to keep
them from revolt. The consequences of this strange assemblage were
vice, immorality, frightful disease, hunger, dreadful mortality among
the settlers; the convicts were decimated by pestilence on the voyage,
and again decimated by famine on their arrival; and the most hideous
cruelty was practised towards the unfortunate natives. Such is the
early history of New South Wales.</p>

<p>After sentence of transportation has been passed, convicts are sent
to the hulks or gaols, where they remain till the period of their
departure arrives. On board convict vessels the convicts are under the
sole control of the surgeon-superintendent, who is furnished with
instructions, as to his conduct, from the Admiralty. The precautions
which have been taken against disease, and the better discipline now
preserved in these ships, have applied an effectual remedy to the
physical evils of the long voyage to Australia, and prevented the
mortality amongst the prisoners which prevailed to a fearful extent
during the earlier periods of transportation. Little diminution,
however, has taken place in those moral evils, which seem to be the
necessary consequences of the close contact and communication between
so many criminals, both during the period of confinement previous to
embarkation, and during the weariness of a long voyage.</p>

<p>As soon as a convict vessel reaches its place of destination, a
report is made by the surgeon-superintendent to the governor. A day is
then appointed for the colonial secretary or for his deputy to go on
board to muster the convicts, and to hear their complaints, if they
have any to make. The male convicts are subsequently removed to the
convict barracks; the females to the penitentiaries. In New South
Wales, however, regulations have lately been established, by which, in
most cases, female convicts are enabled to proceed at once from the
ship to private service. It is the duty of an officer, called the
principal superintendent of convicts, to classify the newly-arrived
convicts, the greater portion of whom are distributed amongst the
settlers as assigned servants; the remainder are either retained in the
employment of the government, or some few of them are sent to the penal
settlements.</p>

<p>On the whole, your Committee may assert that, in the families of
well-conducted and respectable settlers, the condition of assigned
convicts is much the same as the condition of similar descriptions of
servants in this country; but this is by no means the case in the
establishment of all settlers. As the lot of a slave depends upon the
character of his master, so the condition of a convict depends upon the
temper and disposition of the settler to whom he is assigned. On this
account Sir George Arthur, late Governor of Van Diemen's Land, likened
the convict to a slave, and described him "as deprived of liberty,
exposed to all the caprice of the family to whose service he may happen
to be assigned, and subject to the most summary laws; his condition"
(said Sir George) "in no respect differs from that of the slave, except
that his master cannot apply corporal punishment by his own hands or
those of his overseer, and has a property in him for a limited period.
Idleness and insolence of expression, or of looks, anything betraying
the insurgent spirit, subject him to the chain-gang or the triangle, or
hard labour on the roads."</p>

<p>On the other hand, a convict, if ill-treated, may complain of his
master; and if he substantiate his charge the master is deprived of his
services; but for this purpose the convict must go before a bench,
sometimes a hundred miles distant, composed of magistrates, most of
whom are owners of convict labour. Legal redress is therefore rarely
sought for, and still more rarely obtained by the injured convict.</p>

<p>With regard to the general conduct of assigned agricultural
labourers, there was a considerable diversity of opinion. The evidence,
however, of Sir G. Arthur, appears to your Committee to be conclusive
on this point, with regard to which he wrote to the Secretary of State
for the Colonies in the following terms:</p>

<p>"You cannot, my Lord, have an idea of the vexations which accompany
the employment of convicts or of the vicissitudes attendant upon their
assignment. Their crimes and misconduct involve the settlers in daily
trouble, expense, and disappointment. The discipline and control of the
convicts in Van Diemen's Land is carried, perhaps, to a higher degree
than could have ever been contemplated. Many of the convicts have been
greatly reformed when in the service of considerate and judicious
masters; but, with all this abatement, there is so much peculation, so
much insubordination, insolence, disobedience of lawful orders, and so
much drunkenness, that reference to the magisterial authority is
constant, and always attended with loss of time and expense to the
settlers. There can be no doubt things appear better in the colony than
they really are; for, in numberless instances, masters are known to
submit to peculation rather than incur the additional expense of
prosecuting their servants. Two hundred felons, after having been for a
longtime under confinement in the gaols or hulks of England, and
subsequently pent up on board a transport, are placed in charge of the
masters or their agents to whom they have been assigned. The master has
then to take the convict to his home (either to the other extremity of
the island, a distance of 140 miles, or nearer, as the case may be),
and well would it be if he could get him quietly there, but the
contrary is of too frequent occurrence. Either with some money the
convict has secreted, or from the bounty of some old acquaintance, the
assigned servant, now relieved for the first time for some months from
personal restraint, eludes the vigilance of his new master, finds his
way into a public-house, and the first notice the settler has of his
servant, for whom he has travelled to Hobart Town, for whose clothing
he has paid the Government, for whose comfort he has, perhaps, made
other little advances, is, that he is lodged in the watch-house with
loss of half his clothing, or committed to gaol for felony."</p>

<p>The members of the anti-emancipist party in New South Wales
attribute the increase of crime in that colony partly to alleged
relaxation of convict discipline under Sir Richard Bourke; partly to
the action of the Jury Laws, which permit persons who have been
convicts to become jurors; and lastly, to the increasing number of
emancipists.</p>

<p>The first-mentioned cause of the increase of crime in New South
Wales refers to the Quarter Session Act, passed in 1833; by that Act,
the summary jurisdiction of single magistrates over convicts, was
somewhat diminished, and a magistrate was prevented from inflicting
more than 50 lashes for a single offence, instead of 150 which he might
have given before at three separate inflictions. These complaints do
not seem to your Committee to have the slightest foundation in fact,
and Sir Richard Bourke appears to have acted with wisdom, justice, and
humanity in his treatment of the convict population.</p>

<p>With regard to the second alleged cause of the increase of crime,
namely, the jury laws, your Committee need hardly repeat, that the
well-proven effect of transportation is to demoralize, not to reform an
offender; therefore, in a community like New South Wales, wherein so
large a proportion of the population are persons who have been
convicts, to permit such persons generally to sit upon juries must
evidently have an injurious effect. Your Committee, however, must
observe, that under a good system of punishment, an offender should, at
the expiration of his sentence, be considered to have atoned for his
crimes, and he should be permitted to commence a new career without any
reference to his past one.</p>

<p>With regard to the last alleged cause of the increase of crime,
namely, the increasing number of emancipists; little doubt, your
Committee think, can be entertained of the pernicious consequences of
annually turning loose a number of unreclaimed offenders on so small a
community as that of New South Wales.</p>

<p>One of the supposed advantages of transportation is, that it
prevents this country from being burthened with criminal offenders,
after the expiration of their sentences. It is now, however, evident
that transportation does not tend to diminish the sum total of offences
committed in the British Dominions; it may, perhaps, relieve Great
Britain and Ireland from a portion of their burthen of crime; though,
from the little apprehension which transportation produces, that fact
may be reasonably doubted. On the other hand, it only transfers and
aggravates the burthen upon portions of the British Dominions, which,
like New South Wales, and Van Diemen's Land, are least able to bear
it.</p>

<p>In 1836, the free population of New South Wales amounted to 49,255,
of whom about 17,000 had been convicts. In 1834, the free population of
Van Diemen's Land did not exceed 23,315, of whom about 3,000 were
expirees.</p>

<p>Of the state of society in the towns of these colonies, a general
idea may be formed from a description of Sydney, according to the
accounts given of it, by the Chief Police Magistrate and by Mr. Justice
Burton. In 1836 Sydney covered an area of about 2,000 acres and
contained about 20,000 inhabitants; of this number 3,500 were convicts,
most of them in assigned service, and about 7,000 had probably been
prisoners of the Crown. These, together with their associates amongst
the free population, were persons of violent and uncontrollable
passions, which most of them possessed no lawful means of gratifying;
incorrigibly bad characters, preferring a life of idleness and
debauchery by means of plunder to one of honest industry. Burglaries
and robberies were frequently perpetrated by convict servants in the
town and its vicinity, sometimes even in the middle of the day. No town
offered so many facilities for eluding the vigilance of the police as
Sydney did. The unoccupied bush near and within it afforded shelter to
the offender and hid him from pursuit. He might steal or hire a boat
and in a few minutes place an arm of the sea between himself and his
pursuers. The want of continuity in the buildings afforded great
facilities for lying in wait for opportunities of committing crime, for
instant concealment on the approach of the police, and for obtaining
access to the backs of houses and shops; and the drunkenness, idleness,
and carelessness of a great proportion of the inhabitants afforded
innumerable opportunities and temptations, both by day and night, for
those who chose to live by plunder. The greater portion of the
shopkeepers and the middling class had been convicts, for the tradesmen
connected with the criminal population have an advantage over free
emigrants.</p>

<p>Those of the emancipists who were possessed of property had
generally acquired it by dishonest means, by keeping grog-shops,
gambling-houses, by receiving stolen goods, and by other nefarious
practices; they led a life of gross licentiousness; but their wealth
and influence were such that one-fourth of the jurors who served in the
civil and criminal courts during the years 1834, 1835, and 1836,
belonged to their number. More immorality prevailed in Sydney than in
any other town of the same size in the British Dominions; there, the
vice of drunkenness had attained its highest pitch; the quantity of
spirits consumed in Sydney was enormous; even throughout the whole of
New South Wales the annual average, for every human being in the colony
had reached four gallons a head. Such, according to the authorities
already quoted, are the towns to which transportation has given birth;
and such are the inmates furnished to them by the criminal tribunals of
this country.</p>

<p>Your Committee having, in the preceding pages of their Report,
discussed the nature and effects of transportation, and what
alterations can be made in the existing system, now consider that they
have submitted the most unquestionable proofs that the two main
characteristics of transportation, as a punishment, are inefficiency in
deterring from crimes, and remarkable efficiency, not in reforming, but
in still further corrupting those who undergo the punishment; that
these qualities of inefficiency for good, and efficiency for evil, are
inherent in the system, which, therefore, is not susceptible of any
satisfactory improvement; and lastly, that there belongs to the system,
extrinsically from its strange character as a punishment, the yet more
curious and monstrous evil of calling into existence, and continually
extending, societies, or the germs of nations most thoroughly depraved,
as respects both the character and degree of their vicious
propensities. Your Committee, therefore, are of the opinion that the
present system of transportation should be abolished, and will now
proceed to offer a few observations as to the description of punishment
which, in their opinion, ought to be substituted in the stead of
transportation.</p>

"INDEPENDENCE_OF_VICTORIA"></a>INDEPENDENCE OF VICTORIA</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Port Phillip Gazette</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1844 New South Wales (including the Port Phillip and Moreton Bay
districts) was granted representative government, but the distance
between Sydney and Melbourne and the disproportion of representatives
made it a farce as far as Port Phillip was concerned. Melbourne
proceeded to demonstrate to the British Government the necessity for
Separation. Victoria was established as a separate colony in 1851.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Jan. 3rd, 1848.</i> The Separation Despatch.&mdash;To such
writers as cannot comprehend the policy of the Russell administration,
it is common to decry everything which they have attempted, as stupid
and impracticable; but we, who deem ourselves wiser in our generation,
view their conduct in a very different light, and give them credit for
no ordinary talent; great energy, and more perseverance in our affairs,
than can be, under existing circumstances, ascribed to any Ministry in
our day. They took office at a period of great political excitement,
and still they have devoted much attention to Colonial interests; and
they have extraordinary claims upon our beloved Victoria, having
granted us that boon we long demanded in vain from former
Ministers.</p>

<p>The Despatch officially announces that Earl Grey is to bring in a
Bill for the Separation of this, from the Middle District at last, and
that we will form a Colony of our own, under the new name of Victoria.
The Constitution of this Colony will to some extent be identified with
those of the other Australian Colonies.</p>

<p>At present, Earl Grey has put forth simply the general principles;
the details, he says, will form matter for serious consideration and
anxious deliberation.</p>

<p>We anticipate some of the Sydney papers will be coming out with a
cart-load of nonsense; running down Earl Grey's plan, but we will
defend it from their senseless and ignorant declamation.</p>

<p>Monday, <i>July 10th, 1848.</i> Political Gazette. The
Elections.</p>

<p>Our readers must be aware that the writs for the election of members
to serve in the new Legislative Council of the Colony of New South
Wales, have been issued, and that his Worship the Mayor of Melbourne
will hold a meeting of the electors of the City of Melbourne, in front
of the Supreme Court House, La Trobe St. on Tuesday, 25th day of July,
for the nomination of a member to serve in said Council for the
Electoral District of Melbourne.</p>

<p>Wednesday, <i>July 19th, 1848.</i> The Elections.</p>

<p>The outrageous attempt to thrust Mr. Adam Bogue upon the District,
as one of our members for the Legislative Council, has displayed that
we are looked upon as a refuge for the destitute; and that the opinion
of Port Phillip in Sydney is, that any beardless boy without name,
character, or property may be raised upon our shoulders into an office
of great influence, and almost supreme importance.</p>

<p>We have the welfare of the district sincerely at heart, and we
advise the electors to return no members from Sydney. Let them nominate
Port Phillip men and Port Phillip residents whether they can go to
Sydney or not. We entreat the electors not to be made the instrument of
destruction to themselves; let them not elect Sydney members to plunder
Port Phillip.</p>

<p>Electors, place five Port Phillip men in nomination, and one half of
them may go up to Sydney, who would be worth a thousand Sydney Adam
Bogues.</p>

<p>Remember that the nomination will take place to-morrow, opposite the
Court House at noon. We have no wish to treat the pretensions of any
person who comes forward as a candidate for a public office with
disrespect; but we cannot regard the attempt of a young man of neither
standing nor capital to thrust himself into the Legislative Council on
Port Phillip influence, other than a piece of impertinence. We should,
however, have passed it unnoticed, had not this very same person
insulted every man in this Province so recently, by endeavouring to
throw Port Phillip out of the line of steam communication with
England&mdash;when Port Phillip wanted a friend he gave her a kick, and
this should have been the last district for Mr. Bogue to make an offer
of his services to.</p>

<p>Wednesday, <i>July 26th, 1848.</i> To-day's Election.</p>

<p>We approved of the principle of returning no members for the
Legislative Council (so far as the District was concerned) and we
regret that an attempt is about to be made to overthrow these
proceedings, by returning a Member for Melbourne in the person of
J.F.L. Foster, Esq.</p>

<p>This is a question upon which, we are aware, some difference of
opinion exists; but, having commenced the principle, so far as the
District is concerned, we ought to carry it out; if we act otherwise it
will be thrown in the teeth of the citizens of Melbourne that they
disfranchised the District and then returned a Member on their own
account to represent their city.</p>

<p>There required, however, to be unanimity to accomplish this, and
some of the electors having proposed Mr. Foster as a fit and proper
person to represent the City; those who were in favour of carrying out
the principle already adopted at the District Meeting, had nothing left
but to bring forward an opponent to Mr. Foster, and in the person of
the Right Hon. Earl Grey has this opponent been found.</p>

<p>True, did the City wish to send a practical man, we are willing to
accede that Earl Grey is not in a position to sit and work for us in
the Council, but we wish, by electing a man who cannot act, at any rate
for eighteen months, to carry out the principle which the Electors of
the District have already agreed to be correct; we deem it then the
duty of every honest man in this community to give his vote to Earl
Grey, not so much out of respect for His Lordship, as to carry out a
principle; a principle to which we consider the honour of Melbourne to
be pledged.</p>

<p>Mr. Foster is, no doubt, a very excellent kind of man, but having
been withdrawn by his friends, on the morning of the District Election,
we must look upon him as shelved for the present. Let us then return
Earl Grey as one member, and it may do us more good than we can well
conceive at present, as it will give His Lordship a practical
illustration of our helplessness, and thus hasten on Separation.</p>

<p>Hasten then, electors to the poll! and record your vote in favour of
Earl Grey and SEPARATION!!</p>

<p>The Poll commences at Nine o'clock this morning.</p>

<p>Saturday, <i>July 29th.</i> Domestic Gazette. Election of a
Representative for the City of Melbourne.&mdash;On Wednesday last, no
little commotion was created by the election of a member (nominally) to
represent the interests of the Citizens of Melbourne in the Legislative
Council, but the thinking portion of the community having arrived at
the conclusion that representation in the Legislative Council at
Sydney, under existing circumstances, was a farce, had determined,
virtually, upon adopting a similar course to that pursued at the
nomination of Candidates for the District, and the Right Hon. Earl Grey
was consequently proposed as a fit and proper person to represent our
interests in the Legislative Council, and this proposition, with two or
three exceptions, met with unanimous approval at the meeting. After the
first hour's polling, it was clear that Mr. Foster had no chance, and
as this became more and more apparent as the day advanced, some
hundreds of voters who had intended to support the favourite were
deterred from doing so under a conviction that their votes would not be
required, and the unfavourable state of the weather counteracted the
desire to be present at the scene of action. It was understood that the
Mayor would, on the following day, declare on whom the election had
fallen, and at noon, many hundred persons and, notwithstanding the
still unfavourable state of the weather, assembled outside the supreme
Court House, and a few minutes afterwards the excellent Band of the
Total Abstinence Society, might be seen wending their way to the spot,
headed by Mr. J.P. Fawkner.</p>

<p>The Mayor addressed the Meeting as follows:&mdash;"Gentlemen, I have
called you together again for the purpose of declaring on whom the late
election has fallen, but previously to doing so I will read two
protests, one of which has been sent to a deputy returning officer, and
the other to myself." His worship then read the protests, which are as
follows:&mdash;"I, the undersigned burgher of Bourke Ward, do hereby
protest against the Returning Officer receiving any votes for the Right
Hon. Earl Grey, on the following grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, that Earl Grey as a Peer of the British Parliament cannot
hold a seat in a Colonial House of Legislative Representation.</p>

<p>"Second, That he cannot move Her Majesty in two distinct
Legislatures.</p>

<p>"Third, That he is not qualified according to the Act.</p>

<p>"Fourth, That he is an absentee, and there is no one present to
represent him&mdash;to state that he will sit if elected.</p>

<p class='right'>(Signed) "Sidney Stephen, Barrister-at-law."</p>

<p>The Mayor remarked that these protests were very respectably signed,
and were deserving of attention, but although they were signed by
numerous lawyers he believed he was relieved of all difficulty on the
subject by being guided by the 96th clause of the Constitutional Act
which rendered it imperative that all complaints of this nature must be
addressed in the form of a petition to the Governor and must be
addressed by one of the candidates, or one-tenth of the whole of the
electors. Several other authorities were then referred to by His
Worship, who expressed himself thoroughly satisfied as to the course he
ought to pursue, and announced the following as the final state of the
Poll in the Respective Wards.</p>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;A Lady's Visit to the Gold Diggings of
Australia in 1852-53 (Mrs. Charles Clacy), pp. 19-29, 82-85</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gold was discovered in Australia at a time when the people of every
nation in Europe were demanding a greater share in their respective
governments. Many who immigrated in search of gold took a leading part
in making the Australian Governments democratic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Melbourne, 1852.&mdash;The non-arrival of the Mail-steamer left us
now no other care save the all-important one of procuring food and
shelter. Scouts were accordingly despatched to the best hotels; they
returned with long faces&mdash;"full." The second-rate, and in fact
every respectable inn and boarding or lodging-house were tried, but
with no better success. Here and there, a solitary bed could be
obtained, but for our digging-party entire, which consisted of my
brother, four shipmates, and myself, no accommodation could be
procured, and we wished, if possible, to keep together. "It's a case,"
ejaculated one. At this moment the two last searchers approached, their
countenances not quite so woebegone as before. "Well?" exclaimed we all
in chorus, as we surrounded them, too impatient to interrogate at
greater length. Thank Heavens! they had been successful! The
housekeeper of a surgeon, who with his wife had just gone up to Forest
Creek, would receive us to board and lodge for thirty shillings a week
each: but as the accommodation was of the indifferent order, it was not
yet as <i>une affaire arrang&eacute;e</i>. On farther inquiry, we found
the indifferent accommodation consisted in there being but one small
sleeping-room for the gentlemen, and myself to share the bed and
apartment of the temporary mistress. This was vastly superior to
gipsying in the dirty streets, so we lost no time in securing our new
berths; and ere very long, with appetites undiminished by these petty
anxieties, we did ample justice to the dinner which our really kindly
hostess quickly placed before us.</p>

<p>The first night on shore after so long a voyage could scarcely seem
otherwise than strange, one missed the eternal rocking at which so many
grumble on board ship. Dogs (Melbourne is full of them) kept up an
incessant barking; revolvers were cracking in all directions till
daybreak, giving one a pleasant idea of the state of society. The next
few days were busy ones for all, though rather dismal to me, as I was
confined almost entirely indoors, owing to the awful state of the
streets; for in the colonies, at this season of the year, one may go
out prepared for fine weather, with blue sky above, and dry underfoot,
and in less than an hour, should a <i>colonial</i> shower come on, be
unable to cross some of the streets without a plank being placed from
the middle of the road to the pathway, or the alternative of walking in
water up to the knees.</p>

<p>Our party, on returning to the ship the day after our arrival,
witnessed the French-leave-taking of all her crew, who, during the
absence of the Captain, jumped overboard, and were quickly picked up
and landed by the various boats about. This desertion of the ships by
the sailors is an every-day occurrence; the diggings themselves, or the
large amount they could obtain for the run home from another master,
offer too many temptations. Consequently, our passengers had the
amusement of hauling up from the hold their different goods and
chattels; and so great was the confusion, that fully a week elapsed
before they were all got to shore. Meanwhile, we were getting initiated
into colonial prices&mdash;money did, indeed, take to itself wings and
fly away. Fire-arms were at a premium; one instance will
suffice&mdash;my brother sold a six-barrelled revolver for which he had
given sixty shillings at Baker's, in Fleet Street, for sixteen pounds,
and the parting with it at that price was looked upon as a great
favour. Imagine boots, and they were very second-rate ones, at four
pounds a pair. One of our between-deck passengers who had speculated
with a small capital of forty pounds in boots and cutlery, told me
afterwards that he had disposed of them the same evening he landed at a
net profit of ninety pounds&mdash;no trifling addition to a poor man's
purse. Labour was at a very high price, carpenters, boot and shoe
makers, tailors, wheelwrights, joiners, smiths, glaziers, and, in fact,
all useful trades, were earning from twenty to thirty shillings a
day&mdash;the very men working on the roads could get eleven shillings
per diem, and many a gentleman in this disarranged state of affairs,
was glad to fling old habits aside and turn his hand to whatever came
readiest. I knew one in particular, whose brother is at this moment
serving as a Colonel in the army in India, a man more fitted for a gay
London life than a residence in the Colonies. The diggings were too
dirty and uncivilized for his taste, his capital was quickly dwindling
away beneath the expenses of the comfortable life he led at one of the
best hotels in town, so he turned to what as a boy he had learnt as an
amusement, and obtained an addition to his income, of more than four
hundred pounds a year as house carpenter. In the morning you might see
him trudging off to his work, and before night might meet him at some
ball or soir&eacute;e among the elite of Melbourne.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt an elaborate description of the town of
Melbourne, or its neighbouring villages. The town is very well laid
out; the streets (which are all straight, running parallel with and
across one another) are very wide, but are incomplete, not lighted, and
many are unpaved. Owing to the want of lamps, few, except when full
moon, dare stir out after dark. Some of the shops are very fair; but
the goods all partake too largely of the flash order, for the purpose
of suiting the tastes of successful diggers, their wives, and families;
it is ludicrous to see them in the shops&mdash;men who before the
gold-mines were discovered toiled hard for their daily bread taking off
half-a-dozen thick gold rings from their fingers, and trying to pull on
to their rough, well-hardened hands the best white kids, to be worn at
some wedding party, whilst the wife, proud of the novel ornament,
descants on the folly of hiding them beneath such useless articles as
gloves.</p>

<p>The walking inhabitants are of themselves a study; glance into the
streets&mdash;all nations, classes, and costumes are represented there.
Chinamen, with pigtails and loose trousers; aborigines, with a solitary
blanket flung over them; Vandemonian pick-pockets, with cunning eyes
and light fingers&mdash;all, in fact, from the successful digger in his
blue serge shirt, and with green veil still hanging round his
wideawake, to the fashionably attired, newly-arrived "gent" from
London, who stares round him in amazement and disgust. You may see, and
hear too, some thoroughly colonial scenes in the streets. Once, in the
middle of the day, when passing up Elizabeth Street, I heard the
unmistakable sound of a mob behind, and as it was gaining upon me, I
turned into the enclosed ground in front of the Roman Catholic
Cathedral to keep out of the way of the crowd. A man had been taken up
for horse-stealing, and a rare ruffianly set of both sexes were
following the prisoner and the two policemen who had him in charge. "If
but six of ye were of my mind," shouted one, "it's this moment you'd
release him." The crowd took the hint, and to it they set with right
good will, yelling, swearing, and pushing with awful violence. The
owner of the stolen horse got up a counter demonstration, and every few
yards the procession was delayed by a trial of strength between the two
parties. Ultimately, the police conquered; but this is not always the
case, and often lives are lost and limbs broken in the struggle, so
weak is the force maintained by the colonial government for the
preservation of order.</p>

<p align="center">THE DIGGINGS</p>

<p>Of the history of the discovery of gold in Australia I believe few
are ignorant. The first supposed discovery took place some sixty years
ago at Port Jackson. A convict made known to Governor Phillip the
existence of an auriferous region near Sydney, and on the locality
being examined particles of real gold-dust were found. Every one was
astonished, and several other spots were tried without success.
Suspicion was now excited, and the affair underwent a thorough
examination, which elicited the following facts: The convict, in the
hope of obtaining his pardon as a reward, had filed a guinea and some
brass buttons, which, judicially mixed, made a tolerable pile of
gold-dust, and this he carefully distributed over a small tract of
sandy land. In lieu of the expected freedom, his ingenuity was rewarded
with close confinement and other punishments. Thus ended the first idea
of a gold-field in these colonies.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in 1851, at the time that the approaching opening of the
Crystal Palace was the principal subject of attention in England, the
colonies of Australia were in a state of far greater excitement; as the
news spread like wildfire, far and wide, that gold was really there. To
Edward Hammon Hargreaves be given the honour of this discovery. This
gentleman was an old Australian settler, just returned from a trip to
California, where he had been struck by the similarity of the
geological formation of the mountain ranges in his adopted country to
that of the Sacramento district. On his return he immediately searched
for the precious metal; Ophir, the Turon, and Bathurst well repaid his
labour. Thus commenced the gold-diggings of New South Wales.</p>

<p>The good people of Victoria were rather jealous of the importance
given by these events to the other colony. Committees were formed and
rewards were offered for the discovery of a gold-field in Victoria. The
announcement of the Clunes diggings in July 1851 was the result; they
were situated on a tributary of the Lodden. On 8 September those of
Ballarat, and on the 10th those of Mount Alexander completely satisfied
the most sceptical as to the vast mineral wealth of the colony. Bendigo
soon was heard of, and gully after gully successfully attracted the
attention of the public by the display of their golden treasures.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="EFFECTS_OF_THE_GOLD_DISCOVERY" id=
"EFFECTS_OF_THE_GOLD_DISCOVERY"></a>EFFECTS OF THE GOLD DISCOVERY</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;The Gold Digger (Rev. David Mackenzie, M.A.),
pp. 28-31</p>

<p>The excitement produced throughout the colonies, but especially in
Sydney and Melbourne, by the publication of the gold discovery, may be
inferred from the following facts: In one week upwards of 2,000 persons
were counted on the road to the Bathurst diggings, and only eleven
coming down. Hundreds of men, of all classes and conditions, threw up
their situations, and leaving their wives and families behind them,
started for the diggings. Whole crews ran away from their ships, which
were left to rot in our harbours, the men having willingly forfeited
all their wages, clothes, etc. Within one week the prices of the
following goods rose twenty-five per cent. in Sydney: flour, tea,
sugar, rice, tobacco, warm clothing, and boots. Throughout all the
towns nothing was saleable but provisions and diggers' tools and
clothing. Every man who could handle a pick or spade was off, or
preparing to be off, for the gold-fields. The roads were crowded with
travellers, carriages, gigs, drays, carts, and wheelbarrows; mixed up
in one confused assemblage might be seen magistrates, lawyers,
physicians, clerks, tradesmen, and labourers.</p>

<p>The building of houses, bridges, etc., was suspended for want of
tradesmen, nearly all of them having gone to the diggings. Many houses
might be seen half-finished for want of men to proceed with the work,
though the owners or contractors were offering enormously high wages to
any that would complete the work. The fields were left unsown, flocks
of sheep were deserted by their shepherds. With one stockholder who has
twenty thousand sheep, there remained only two men. Masters were seen
driving their own drays; and ladies of respectability and ample means
were obliged to cook the family dinner. Servants and apprentices were
off in a body; and even the very "devils" bolted from the newspaper
offices; in short, the yellow fever seized on all classes of society.
In twenty-four hours prices of provisions doubled at Bathurst and the
neighbouring places. In all our steamers and trading vessels the rate
of passage was raised, in consequence of the necessary increase in the
wages of seamen. All the trades held their meetings, at which a new
tariff of charges was agreed upon; and even the publicans raised at
least twenty-five per cent. the prices of their wines, beer, and
spirits.</p>

<p>Van Diemen's Land and New Zealand poured upon our shores shiploads
of adventurers, attracted by the golden news; and South Australia is
now almost drained of its labouring population, one of the consequences
of which is that the shares in the famous Burra Burra copper mines
there have fallen from &pound;230 to &pound;45, a fall which has
entailed ruin on hundreds.</p>

<p>In walking along the streets of Sydney or Melbourne you hear nothing
talked about but gold; you see nothing exhibited in shop windows but
specimens of gold, or some article of equipment for the gold-digger. In
every society gold is the interminable topic of conversation; and
throughout the colonies the only newspapers now read are those which
contain intelligence from our golden fields.</p>

<p>Soon after the discovery the Government of New South Wales, seeing
that it could not prevent the community from digging for gold on Crown
lands, quietly made virtue of necessity, and merely sought to legalize
and regulate the diggings by the following announcement, published in
the "Official Gazette":</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GOLD_MINES" id="THE_GOLD_MINES"></a>THE GOLD
MINES</h2>

<p class='right'>Colonial Secretary's Office,<br>
 Sydney, <i>23rd May, 1851.</i></p>

<p align="center">Licenses to Dig and Search for Gold.</p>

<p>With reference to the Proclamation issued on the 22nd May instant,
declaring the rights of the Crown in respect to Gold found in its
natural place of deposit within the territory of New South Wales, His
Excellency the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, has
been pleased to establish the following Provisional Regulations, under
which Licenses may be obtained, to search for, and remove the same:</p>

<p>1. From and after the first day of June next, no person will be
permitted to dig, search for, or remove gold on or from any land,
whether public or private, without first taking out and paying for a
License in the form annexed.</p>

<p>2. For the present, and pending further proof of the extent of the
Gold-field, the License fee has been fixed at &pound;1 10<i>s.</i> per
month, to be paid in advance; but it is to be understood that the rate
is subject to future adjustment, as circumstances may render
expedient.</p>

<p>3. The Licenses can be obtained on the spot, from the Commissioner
who has been appointed by His Excellency the Governor, to carry these
regulations into effect, and who is authorized to receive the fee
payable thereon.</p>

<p>4. No person will be eligible to obtain a License, or the renewal of
a License, unless he shall produce a certificate of discharge from his
last service, or prove to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that he
is not a person improperly absent from hired service.</p>

<p>5. Rules, adjusting the extent and position of land to be covered by

<p>Even on the spot it is often very difficult to learn when, by whom,
and in what manner, a new gold district is first discovered. When the
yield of an old working begins to fail, the diggers throw out small
"prospecting" parties of twos and threes, to explore promising
localities. These "prospectors" may occasionally make important
discoveries; but far more frequently they are the result of chance, or
of the desultory efforts of shepherds and other servants of the
settlers resident in the particular locality. It sometimes happens that
a digging party, travelling from one district to another, camp for a
night in a valley which they may think looks very promising. Being
delayed here, perhaps, by the loss of their horse, or some other
accident, they sink a pit or "hole" in a "likely spot." At length some
one strikes a rich deposit. If so, it cannot long remain a secret. A
few dozens or scores are shortly at work on the adjacent ground; and if
these too are successful the news spreads like wild-fire, and within a
week all the roads and tracks leading to the spot are covered with
diggers and their carts, on the way to the new Dorado&mdash;the
<i>newest</i> being always by report the <i>best</i> and richest. In a
few days the hills around the new working are dotted over with white
tents, the forest around them quickly disappears, being felled for
firewood. Government, on hearing of the discovery, sends down a
Commissioner with a body of horse and foot police. These establish a
camp on some central elevated position, and an irregular wide street of
tents springs up like magic in the valley below. There are stores,
large and small; butchers' shops; doctors' little tents; and
innumerable refreshment booths, where, under the guise of selling
lemonade and home-made beer, an extensive illicit trade is carried on
in vile, adulterated, and often poisonous spirits. The blacksmith is
always one of the first on the ground, and presently extemporises a
forge out of a few loose stones or turf-sods. Flags are flying from the
stores and shops, and give gaiety to the scene. The Union Jack floats
proudly above the Government camp on the hill, and military sentinels
are on duty before the gold-tent.</p>

<p>As the diggers reach the spot they pitch their tents on the lower
slopes of the hills or in the green flats. At night their watch-fires
gleam far and wide, and from a neighbouring height the place has the
appearance of a large town illuminated. A new goldfield is the
favourite resort of horse stealers, thieves, and miscreants of all
kinds, who, lost in the crowd and confusion, here find ample
opportunities for carrying on their nefarious practices. Their common
haunts are the "sly grog-shops" which spring up like weeds on all
sides. Here they rendezvous, and concoct those deeds of darkness which
have given the colony such an unenviable fame.</p>

<p>Horses are stolen and ridden off to Melbourne, Geelong, or to the
nearest goldfield and sold by auction. The roads leading to the new
diggings become infested with bushrangers; stories of being "stuck up"
(or robbed) are more and more frequent; till at length a cartload of
ruffians, heavily handcuffed, is seen moving towards the Government
Camp well guarded by mounted troopers. These are the bushrangers who
have been hunted down and just captured by the troopers. And now for a
time the roads are safe.</p>

<p>No life can be more independent and free than that of the Australian
digger; no travelling more agreeable than summer travelling in the
Bush; carrying about with you in your cart your tent, your larder, and
all your domestic appointments. In choosing a halting place for the
night you have the whole country open to you&mdash;no walls or hedges
to shut you in to a dusty turnpike road. You drink from the clear
running creek; the soft green turf is your carpet; your tent your
bedroom. Your horse duly hobbled, enjoys the fresh pasturage around.
The nearest fallen tree supplies you with fuel for your evening
fire.</p>

<p>One of the most fruitful sources of discontent was the method of
collecting the gold revenue. When the first discoveries were made at
Ballarat, the Melbourne Government, following the example of that at
Sydney, issued regulations by which all miners were required to procure
a monthly license to dig for gold, and to pay 30<i>s.</i> for the same.
But how was this tax to be enforced among a migratory population,
living in tents scattered through a forest? The mode adopted was, to
send out armed bands of police, who, coming down suddenly on a gully or
flat, spread themselves over it demanding of everyone his license. A
few mounted troopers formed part of the force to cut off defaulters who
might attempt to fly. All who could not produce their license were
captured and marched off, probably some miles, to the nearest
magistrates, and, after some detention, were either fined &pound;5, or
imprisoned for a month. Such a system naturally led to great discontent
and irritation. At some of the goldfields a curious plan was hit upon
for evading these inquisitorial visits. No sooner was a party of police
seen approaching than the diggers raised the cry of "Joe! Joe!" The cry
was taken up, and presently the whole length of the gully rang with the
shouts "Joe! Joe! Joe!" and of course all defaulters instantly made off
for the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction was exasperated by the method of collecting the
license fee. The collector did not call on the tax payer, but the
latter had to seek the collector. The digger was compelled to walk from
his own gully to the Commissioner's Camp&mdash;distant, perhaps,
several miles&mdash;and then often wait for hours under a fierce sun
while a crowd of others, who had arrived before him, were paying their
30<i>s.</i>, or weighing their half ounce of gold. Greater facilities
were indeed subsequently offered for the payment of the fee, but the
mode of enforcing it continued the same. The diggers complained loudly
and unceasingly of these harsh and un-English measures. "First you tax
our labour," said they, "and then you collect your tax at the point of
the bayonet." The dislike of the system was universal; disputes were
frequent, and collisions between the police and diggers sometimes
occurred.</p>

<p>Another of the diggers' grievances was the extreme insecurity of
life and property on the mines. While the police force were snugly
housed at headquarters, in a peaceable and orderly neighbourhood, the
populous and remote gullies were the nightly scenes of deeds of robbery
and violence. Every evening men were knocked down and brutally treated
or "stuck up" and robbed. Every night horses were stolen, tents broken
into, and "holes" plundered of gold by the "night
fossickers"&mdash;miscreants who watched for the richest "holes" during
the day, marked them, and plundered them at night. In October 1852 at a
place called Moonlight Flat (near Forest Creek), these desperadoes had
become so numerous and shameless, and their outrages so frequent, that
the miners rose <i>en masse</i> against them. A public meeting was
convened; blue-shirted diggers made stirring appeals to their auditory;
a deputation was appointed to proceed instantly to Melbourne to
remonstrate with the Government, and to implore it to adopt energetic
measures for extirpating the "hordes of ruffians" that infested their
neighbourhood, and the persons of many of whom were well known
there.</p>

BUSHRANGERS</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;The Golden Colony (G.H. Wathen, 1855), pp. 138,
143-150</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The combination of convictism in Tasmania and gold in Victoria and
New South Wales produced bushranging on a large scale. Convicts now had
a chance of living well if they escaped, and many took advantage of the
opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the Australian roads in winter may be well likened to those
English roads of 200 years ago, out of which the King's Coach had to be
dug by the rustics, so may the Australian Bushranger be regarded as the
legitimate representative of the traditionary highwayman who levied
toll at Highgate, or stopped the post-boy and captured the mailbags in
Epping Forest. The real, living bushranger is, however, more of a
ruffian and less of a hero than our ideal highwayman; for time, like
distance, softens down the harsh and the coarse, and gives dignity to
the ignoble.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, did a country offer so tempting a field to the
public robber as Victoria did during the first year or two after the
gold discovery. The interior was wild and uninhabited, abounding with
lonely forests. Travellers were numerous, and mostly carried money or
gold; for none were poor. The roadside public-houses were daily the
scenes of drunken revelry. The police were few and untrained; and the
mixed and scattered population at the several diggings offered a ready
asylum in case of pursuit. Add to all this that, separated from
Victoria by a mere strait, was the depot for the most accomplished
villains of Great Britain, and it needed no prophet to foresee that the
roads of the new gold country would very soon be swarming with thieves
and desperadoes.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon occurrence in the Australian Colonies for a large
number of shearers or others collected in the hut in the country to be
"stuck up," that is, subdued and bound, by two or three determined
bushrangers. Fifteen or sixteen strong active men may be thus treated,
and have been, frequently. At first, one is ready to conclude either
that they must have a private understanding with the robbers or else be
the veriest poltroons. I thought so myself till I had an account of one
of these affairs from a man who had been one of a large party thus
"stuck up" by two very notorious bushrangers, the life and death of
whom, would furnish materials for a romance. Their names were Dalton
and Kelly, and they will long be famous in the annals of daring and
outrage in Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>Dalton was a stout, powerful man, and about thirty years of age at
the time of the rencontre I am about to describe. His accomplice Kelly,
was about twenty-three years old. They were both prisoners of the Crown
in Van Diemen's Land. Dalton was transported at an early age, and had
for a time been confined in the "Ocean Hell" of Norfolk Island, the
gaol of the double-damned convict; but was afterwards taken back to Van
Diemen's Land. From the same informant I learned some particulars of
their escape. They were confined in a penal establishment on a strait
or an arm of the sea, wide enough, it was thought, to preclude the
possibility of flight. Dalton, Kelly, and five or six other prisoners,
however, weary of a wretched life, determined to risk that life for
liberty; and having one day eluded the vigilance of their guards,
attempted, though their legs were weighed down with fetters, to swim to
the opposite shore. One after another their strength failed them; they
sank and disappeared till at length only Kelly and Dalton survived.
Kelly's strength was rapidly waning, when Dalton called out to him
"Catch hold of me, Kelly! I can swim another hour yet."</p>

<p>When at last they both got safe to land, Dalton exclaimed, "Well,
thank God, I shall have one comrade at any rate."</p>

<p>They now quickly freed themselves from their irons, procured arms,
and, knowing that they would certainly be hotly pursued they at once
started on a marauding expedition, visiting the neighbouring stations
in succession, and pillaging each; intending eventually, to make their
way across Bass's Straits to Victoria. Dalton was a very formidable
fellow; strong, active, and resolute, reckless of human life, and now
rendered desperate by despair. He was, too, a first-rate marksman, and
could "stick up a glass bottle."</p>

<p>What follows is an account given me by my informant. Kelly came up
to the hut, which was full of men. I was standing at the door at the
time, but did not know who the man was. When he came close he asked me
if I had heard that the bushrangers were out. I answered "Yes, I had."
Then he pointed his gun at me, and said "I'm one of them. Go into the
hut." I went in, but on turning round I saw one of my mates standing
against the hut in a corner, with another man standing over him,
covering him with his gun. The other was Dalton, Kelly's mate. After I
had gone into the hut, Kelly stood at the open doorway, with his gun
pointed at those inside, swearing he would murder the first man who
moved an inch. There were about fourteen men in the hut. Then he asked
if there were any prisoners among them. One man said that he was. Kelly
then ordered him to tie their arms together, one by one.</p>

<p>While doing so, one man complained that he was being tied too tight;
but this only drew forth another volley of oaths and threats from
Kelly. When all were secured, Kelly went out to assist Dalton who still
stood over the man whom he had pinned to the wall of the hut,
threatening to shoot him if he stirred. Kelly then tied up his hands
while Dalton continued covering him with the gun. He was then marched
into the hut to join the others. And now Dalton began walking up and
down the hut haranguing his prisoners. "He'd no doubt" he said "that
some of them might be good and honest men, and some scoundrels. That
for his part, he wouldn't hurt a hair of any good man's head, if he
could help it. But he had been forced to take to this sort of life. It
wasn't his fault. He had been lagged (transported) when only twelve
years of age; had since then over and over again tried to obtain his
freedom by good conduct; but they wouldn't give it him, and it was
useless to try any more by fair means. And he had now sworn to gain his
freedom, or lose his life in the attempt. He didn't want to hurt
anyone. What he wanted was money; and money he would have, come what,
come might. He'd show them presently whether he was game or not. He'd
go into the master's house and bring out, single-handed the man he
wanted, no matter how many he might find there. But let them beware. If
any man dared to move or tried to escape he swore he'd scatter his
brains about the yard, and blow the roof off his head."</p>

<p>Dalton now left the hut, and went to the house of the settler, their
master, which was close at hand. All this time the household knew
nothing of what had been passing in the hut. He entered, and went
straight up to the sitting-room, where several gentlemen and ladies
happened to be collected. He opened the door, and deliberately advanced
with his gun pointed at those within. But a lady, who chanced to be
behind the door, on seeing the levelled gun, slammed the door in the
robber's face. This was a timely diversion, and the signal for a
general scattering of those present.</p>

<p>The men in the hut were subsequently tried for collusion with the
bushrangers; but when asked how they could suffer two men to "stick up"
so many, one replied to the magistrate, that, with their permission, he
would himself "stick up" the whole Bench.</p>

<p>The free servants were acquitted; those of the party who were
prisoners of the Crown were sentenced to imprisonment; but on
Government being petitioned by their free mates, who protested the
innocence of all, they were liberated.</p>

<p>After this the two bushrangers boldly carried on their depredations,
roaming about from station to station, "sticking up" the men, and
robbing the masters; while a large party of the police were following
on their track. One day they came to a hut full of men, and, opening
the door, tried the old plan of intimidation by standing with loaded
double-barrelled pieces in the doorway, and threatening with deep oaths
to "drop" the first man of them, who moved hand or foot. But it
happened that several of the pursuing constables were within the hut.
One of them, named Buckmaster, rushed towards Dalton. The robber fired
and the constable fell dead. Dalton still stood unmoved in the doorway,
with his levelled gun, and calmly said "Ah, how d'ye like that? Now,
then, I'm ready for another!" This coolness saved them both and for a
time they escaped capture. But such an outrage on one of their officers
roused the Government. A large reward was offered for the capture of
the two bushrangers, and they were hunted through the island more hotly
than ever.</p>

<p>Driven to desperation, they seized upon a whaleboat; by threats
pressed four boatmen into their service, and actually compelled them to
work the boat across Bass's Straits to the opposite shores of Victoria.
Here they safely landed on the solitary coast of Western Port and made
their way up to Melbourne. News of the escape of these formidable and
blood-stained freebooters had been immediately transmitted to the
authorities of Victoria. As they had left Van Diemen's Land in an open
whaleboat, there was no doubt but that they would make for the Western
Port shores; and the Victoria police, stimulated by the hope of a large
reward, were keenly looking out for two persons answering to the
published description of the robbers. The boatmen who had conveyed them
across the Strait were seen and arrested at Dandenong, between Western
Port and the Capital; but no further trace of the bushrangers could be
obtained. The Melbourne newspapers furnish us with the conclusion of
the tragedy.</p>

<p>The following account of the capture of the chief of these
desperadoes, from the Melbourne "Argus" is more like a page from a
romance than a passage in real life. It is one more instance of what
appears like a special Providence laying its resistless hand on a
murderer at the very moment when he seemed to have secured his escape,
and dragging him forth to public justice. Within four hours after his
capture, Dalton would have been on board a ship bound for England.</p>

<p>"Between eleven and twelve o'clock on Friday night, Dalton entered a
coffee-shop in Bourke Street, in company with a man who had engaged to
put him on board the <i>Northumberland</i> at daylight the next morning
from Sandridge, and for which he was to pay &pound;4. This man, we
understand, was quite ignorant of the person he was bargaining with.
Dalton asked the proprietors of the shop, if they could change him some
Van Diemen's Land Notes for gold, as he was about to embark for
England. They could not do it, but a gentleman named Brice, formerly a
cadet in the police force, suspecting all was not right, said that he
could, as he was a gold-broker, if Dalton would only accompany him to
his office. To this Dalton consented, and placed three &pound;20 and
one &pound;10 notes of the Launcestoun Bank in his hands. They then
left the shop together; the night was extremely dark; the stranger,
however, led the way, Dalton and the boatman following close behind.
After proceeding some little way, they turned into Little Collins St.
and by the back entrance, into the yard of the Police Court. Here it
was so dark that the outline of the building could not be
distinguished. The guide then showed them the door of his alleged
office which was no other then the clerk's room of the Swanston St.
watch-house. The man at the door was in plain clothes, and within were
several of the detective officers, and two watch-housekeepers at the
books, all, however, in private costume. Once in, Mr. Brice stated that
he had brought these men to the station on suspicion of having come by
the notes wrongfully.</p>

<p>"Dalton at this time must have known where he was, but made no
observation beyond affirming that they were his, and making some
remarks relative to his being brought there on so paltry an accusation.
During this he was smoking a cigar, and behaving himself in a careless
nonchalant manner. Meanwhile, the detectives were making use of their
eyes, and seeing if the descriptions they possessed corresponded with
the figures before them. The watch-house keeper finding that Mr. Brice
had no charge to prefer against him, returned Dalton his notes, who was
about to leave the office, when Detectives Williams, Murray, and Eason
pounced upon him, and fixed him in a corner. Dalton endeavoured to draw
a pistol from his belt, but was prevented and overpowered. Finding
himself mastered, he said, 'You have got the reward of &pound;500. My
name is Dalton!' He then said if he had only seen the bars of the
station-house window, as he was entering, he would have sent a ball
through his conductor. He further said that he had been in the Police
Court that morning, and had recollected going up a flight of steps
which he did not see that night, as he had been led in the back way,
and had he but seen these steps, his guide would have been a dead man.
He was then handcuffed and searched, and two large horse-pistols
heavily loaded and capped, besides a small one, were taken from his
belt; he was then locked up."</p>

<p>Kelly, the other accomplice, was arrested the next day, and both
were sent back to Van Diemen's Land, tried, and executed.</p>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Port Phillip Gazette, 21st January 1851</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The uselessness of protests against Transportation from the various
states, proved the necessity for the whole of Australia to act together
in external affairs. Thus the inauguration of the Anti-Transportation
League was the first step towards Federation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">BREAKFAST TO THE TASMANIAN DELEGATES</p>

<p>On Monday, the members and promotors of the Launceston Association
for securing the cessation of transportation, entertained at Public
breakfast the gentlemen delegated to represent the interests of the
Colony at the Australian Conference, which is about to be held in
Melbourne. A cold collation was prepared at the Cornwall, and about 100
gentlemen sat down, amongst whom were many magistrates and gentlemen
representing the most influential and respectable portions of the
northern and midland districts. Breakfast being concluded, the Chairman
rose, and said, it was a matter of pleasure to him to meet so large and
respectable a body of gentlemen, some of whom he had known for a
quarter of a century. They had not assembled to petition; it was a
truth deplorable and sad that petitions had hitherto been unavailing
and they were now met to force from Her Majesty's Government, relief
from an evil of which history presented no parallel. (Hear, hear.)
Petition after petition had been transmitted home, but the prayers of
the Community had been constantly rejected. It now remained to try
other means.</p>

<p>The Rev. J. West rose and said he felt some embarrassment in
addressing that meeting. He, however, felt grateful for their
recognition of his appointment, and should rely on their indulgence
during the few moments he might address them. The colonists had been
led up to a position from which it was impossible to recede. Van
Diemen's Land must obtain a share in the general freedom, or for ever
sink. They had petitioned for a cessation of transportation; whilst
there was a possibility of the other colonies receiving a portion of
the convicts annually sent from Britain, they expected by the more
general distribution to experience some relief. But the resistance of
the other colonies had removed the faint anticipation, and shut up to
us this last hope&mdash;to our union with them. When it was proposed to
solicit the co-operation of the adjacent colonies, some persons
prophesied a failure; it was thought by some, improbable that the
colonies would feel any interest in our fate. But the heart of an
Englishman is ever susceptible of pity; and when we spoke of our wrongs
they listened; and when we exposed the enormous danger, they consulted
their own safety, and came forward to our help. Let us look well to our
position. We have to change the policy and contend against the power of
a mighty Empire. In the effervescence and excitement of public speaking
it was not at all surprising that a threat should sometimes be uttered;
but many years must elapse before an appeal to physical force would
bear even the semblance of reason. We have, then a mighty Empire to
contend against&mdash;one which can laugh our threatening to scorn. And
what are the weapons we must employ? What, but the weapons of truth? We
must diffuse right information; we must expose our wrongs&mdash;and we
must appeal to the justice of the British Nation. Let the evils and
injuries under which this fair domain of the Crown now suffers, be laid
before the English people, and a cry will be heard from Land's End to
the opposite shore, "transportation shall cease because it degrades the
British name." (Cheers.) The injuries resulting from transportation to
the colony are various. A gentleman, however eminent his station and
virtues, going to a distant part of the world must cautiously suppress
the fact, that he came from Van Diemen's Land, or even this quarter of
the globe. (Hear, hear.) Yes, Sir, our sons, who have quitted this
colony in search of a home denied them in the land of their birth, have
been compelled to conceal the place from which they came, and to drop
into the box, by stealth, those letters which were to relieve parental
anxiety, and express their filial affection. And is this to be for ever
endured? Shall our own children never know the pleasure and pride of
patriotism? Shall we not ask all the colonies of the Australian empire
to aid us in our struggle? Shall we not confide in the justice of
Australasia?</p>

<p>When it is said that England cannot support 4,000 or 5,000 offenders
the question naturally occurs: What has she not done? Did not England
for her Continental wars incur a debt of &pound;800,000,000: did she
not give &pound;20,000,000 to free her West India slaves; did she not
expend &pound;7,000,000 to combat the famine of Ireland? Is not the
proposed expenditure for the National Executive of the present year an
evidence of her boundless opulence? And yet to save a trifling outlay
compared with the injustice now done, the representative of Her Majesty
is compelled to carry about under his skirts a parcel of convictism; to
deposit these tokens of imperial interest he is driven to have recourse
to artifice, trickery and falsehood. (Hear, hear.) As England glories
in her past history, and has found means to keep afloat that flag which
has never been lowered; so she must find means to carry on a nobler
struggle with her own poverty and crime. Hitherto, Van Diemen's Land
has not been heard at home; but if by the united voices of the other
colonies, a sort of telegraphic communication can be opened with
Britain, if a speaking trumpet be formed, we shall be heard. When he
(Mr. West) heard that Ministers had departed from their promise that
transportation should cease, he was astonished and desponding&mdash;he
thought that if a promise so solemnly given could be so recklessly
broken, hope was delusion. But as in the moral, so it is in the
political world. The Divine Being frequently ordains that good shall
arise out of apparent evils; that a tedious delay shall make the remedy
more perfect. Had we been relieved when Ministers promised; then,
transportation to the other colonies would have been continued, and its
evils accumulate there. (Hear, hear.) When it was proposed that all the
colonies should receive a share of convicts, all things considered, he,
(the speaker) for one could not have then objected to Van Diemen's Land
being joined in the co-partnery. Had such been the case a century might
have elapsed before the reproach of convictism had been removed from
this hemisphere. But the refusal of the other colonies occasioned by
the injuries inflicted on this, has roused us all into action, and now
all declare that not a man, no, not one&mdash;in fetters shall be
landed in Australia. (Tremendous cheering.)</p>

<p>If an unfortunate offender becomes as a penitent desirous of
amending his life, and disposed to conform to the usages, and claims of
honest society, he will find no man here spitefully to remind him of
his former errors. But if he is brought wearing the badge of disgrace
we will not have him. We will say to the British Government "Until you
can with safety discharge him into your community, he shall not enter
ours." (Loud Cheers.) This is the righteous principle upon which we
have taken our stand. Whilst we were disputing among ourselves who
should bear the load, we were likely to be sacrificed by our ungenerous
divisions. But we have now a new principle; and a principle is a
wedge&mdash;if sufficient force is applied, every obstacle will be
riven into shivers. We now say that no man should be an involuntary
gaoler, much less shall the inhabitants of these colonies be the penal
slaves and gaolers of the British Empire. (Cheers.) We assert that a
community should deal with its own crime, at least so deal with it that
in its disposal it shall not injure those who never offended&mdash;so
at least that the honest and industrious labourer should not be brought
into unfavourable comparison and competition with the hardened
criminal, so that, at all events our sons shall not be driven from
their homes to seek employment in distant lands&mdash;to meet there
suspicion and contempt. These are the wrongs of which we
complain&mdash;wrongs which could never have been perpetrated but in
oblivion of that first great Law, alike the basis of private and public
virtue: "do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you." The
Rev. gentleman resumed his seat amidst loud and prolonged cheering.</p>

<p>W.P. WESTON, ESQ.&mdash;It was with mingled feelings that he rose to
address that meeting; but when he ascertained that Mr. West was to
accompany him, he lost all fear, and at once accepted the
invitation.</p>

<p>It had not been considered necessary to furnish them with written
instructions how to act; it was left entirely to their own judgement;
they had, as it were, a <i>carte blanche</i>; but he thought it
advisable to mention one or two points towards which he and his
colleague would direct public attention on the other side of the
Straits. The first was, that transportation as hitherto conducted, was
altogether and entirely rotten. He anticipated no very great difficulty
in establishing that point. The next was, that no country had a right
to force its crime upon a distant and unoffending one; it was a moral
wrong. He was much struck at a remark which appeared in the Public
journals in Melbourne. It seems to have been the custom of some persons
to collect all the filth and rubbish from their persons and during the
night to force it upon the premises of their neighbours. Now, these
persons were designed miscreants, the paragraph commenced "the
miscreants have been at work again." But he considered that the
Government who would force a mass of moral filth upon a small and
helpless colony were miscreants in the very worst sense of the term.
(Hear, hear.) However severely the evils of convictism may have been
felt in this community, they will be felt at Melbourne in a greater
degree. Any evil may be counter-balanced and perhaps removed, if it can
only be seen. The convicts come to this land under restraint and are
completely at the disposal of the Government, but after completing
their education in a chain-gang, and filling up, as it were, the
measure of their iniquity they go over there where they are unknown to
the police and consequently their crimes escape detection. The very
worst characters amongst us proceed to the neighbouring colonies as
soon as an opportunity offers. This fact accounts for the insecurity of
property at Melbourne. A short time ago he was there and not more than
two or three days after his arrival the linen which had been put out
for washing, was stolen. Shortly after whilst the family were sitting
at tea, information was given that the bedroom window was open and upon
proceeding to ascertain the cause it was discovered that a thief had
effected an entrance and carried off whatever he could lay his hands
upon.</p>

<p>A letter lately received mentions that six gentlemen's horses in one
locality had been robbed and that Melbourne was full of thieves. (A
laugh.) No opportunity had previously offered of talking to the
Melbourne people upon the subject, they were so occupied in endeavours
to obtain separation from Sydney that every question was lost sight of;
but now the matter was settled he did not apprehend any difficultly in
establishing this point also.</p>

<p>We are a loyal people, and have given abundant proof of our loyalty;
but it is not an unalterable principle. There is an old Spanish
proverb&mdash;"The sweetest wine makes the sourest vinegar," and so it
will be with us.</p>

<p>But the British Government must, and will yield, for they will find
it will be to their interest, as well as their duty to grant the
reasonable request of the Australian Colonies. (Cheers.)</p>

<p>Three cheers were then given for the Chairman, and three more for
the Queen, and the meeting terminated.</p>

QUESTION</h2>

<p>The adjustment of the English land laws to Australian requirements
was a difficult task. The question was discussed in New South Wales in
1855, but South Australia, under the leadership of Torrens, was the
first to effect reform (1859).</p>

Property (Torrens, 1858), pp. 5-6, 8-11</p>

<p>Extract from an address to the Electors of the City of Adelaide
delivered in the Theatre on 31st January, 1857. (From the South
Australian Register of February 2nd, 1857).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next topic which I have put down to address you upon, is one
with respect to which I should have wished to have had time to arrange
my thoughts&mdash;it is the cheapening of the law of Conveyancing of
real property. (Applause.) Next to affording fair facilities for
obtaining possession of the waste lands of the Crown, and converting
them into cornfields and homesteads of independent yeomanry, it is the
duty of the State to afford a cheap and at the same time a secure mode
of conveying that property from man to man. (Hear, hear.) I have for
years felt that the law of England in that respect, which we brought
with us, required amendment. In looking also to the laws of other
countries with respect to the transfer, mortgage, or encumbrance of
real property, I have come to the conclusion that the law of England is
inferior to most of them with regard to cost and security of title. The
old Conservative feeling of England adheres with a sort of veneration
to laws and usages respecting title which originated under the feudal
system, and is loath to abandon them for a system adapted to the
requirements of modern civilization. I would illustrate my views by
observing that, in ancient times, before the Wars of the Roses, a
baron, or even a yeoman, would surround his residence with a moat to be
crossed only by a drawbridge, and instead of the convenient door of
modern times, he would have a portcullis, which he would raise or let
fall to admit a friend, or exclude a foe. A visitor, too, would have
instead of gaining immediate access, to sound a horn at an outer gate,
and hold parley with a warder upon a lofty tower, before he could gain
admission. There could be no doubt that all these ceremonies and
parleyings were necessary in those days, but it does not follow that we
should carry them out in our times. Were any person now, to surround
his residence with a deep and broad ditch, and observe those ceremonies
when a visitor called upon him, we would call him insane; yet, that is
precisely what we do with regard to the transfer of real estate,
observing still the tortuous roundabout methods of conveying, resorted
to in those days for the purpose of evading the oppressions of
feudalism. Nay, the analogy is so strong, that in our Law Courts, and
Deeds we still use the same barbarous Norman French jargon in which the
parley was in those ancient days held at the gate of the baronial
residence. (Hear, and applause.) It is perhaps presumptuous of a person
who has not received a legal education, to address his mind to this
question; seeing, however, that the persons who, by ability, and
education, are best fit to cope with the subject, are not willing, or,
at least have not done so, I have taken the task upon myself. (Hear,
hear). With your permission, I will give you an outline of the plan.
The purchaser of land from the Crown shall receive a title deed, a land
grant, as at present to be executed in duplicate, and one copy filed in
the Registrar-General's office. When an original purchaser sells the
land to another, he shall transfer it by a simple memorandum, which
being brought to the office of the Registrar-General the original land
grant must be surrendered, and then the Registrar will issue a new
title to the second purchaser direct from the Crown. (Hear, hear.) This
will get over the difficulty of tracing title through all manner of
intricate transactions between purchasers, and instead of a man having
to carry about an immense bale of papers, he would have one simple
document, which would, nevertheless, be a title valid and indisputable,
because it would be an original land grant. (Great applause.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speech delivered on 4th June, 1857, in the Legislative Assembly by
the Hon. the Treasurer, Mr. Torrens, on the introduction of his Bill
for amending the law relating to the Transfer of Real Property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not attempt to remedy the evils complained of, by
amendment of the existing law; that I believe to be impossible: I
propose to abolish a system irremediably wrong in principle, and to
substitute a method which I believe will, when explained, commend
itself to the House as consistent with common sense, perfectly
feasible, and effectual for all purposes required.</p>

<p>The first and leading principle of the measure which I introduce, is
designed to cut off the very source of all costliness, insecurity,
litigation, by abolishing altogether the system of retrospective titles
and ordaining that as often as the fee simple is transferred, the
existing title must be surrendered to the Crown, and a fresh grant from
the Crown issued to the new proprietor.</p>

<p>The principle next in importance prescribes that registration <i>per
se</i> and alone shall give validity to transactions affecting land.
Deposit of duplicate of the instrument, together with the record of the
transaction by memorandum entered in the book of registration and
endorsed on the grant by the Registrar-General, to constitute
registration. This method is designed to give confidence and security
to purchasers and mortgagees, through the certainty that nothing
affecting the title can have existence beyond the transactions of which
they have notice in the memoranda endorsed on the grant.</p>

<p>My third principle aims at simplicity and economy by prescribing
certain stereotyped forms of instruments available to each occasion to
be supplied at the Registry Office, so that any man of ordinary sense
and education may transact his own business, without the necessity of
applying to a solicitor, except in complicated cases of settlements or
entails, which are unusual in this colony.</p>

<p>Many will admit that the system which I recommend might have been
introduced at the first founding of this colony, with facility and very
great advantage, but doubt its practicability now that titles have
become complicated. Admitting a difficulty, I deny that it is
insurmountable, or such as should cause us to hesitate in securing the
advantage of transfer by registration. I do not propose a scheme
involving violent or arbitrary interference with existing titles, but
would leave it optional with proprietors to avail themselves of it or
not. It will thus be gradual in its operation, yet will put titles in
such a train that the desired result will eventually be obtained.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot conclude without expressing my grateful sense
of the compliment which the House has paid me, in listening with such
marked attention to an address extended to an unusual length upon a
subject admitted to be dry and unexciting.</p>

<p>I propose, it is true, a sweeping measure of reform, yet not more
thorough than the nature of the case imperatively demands. In this
view, I am again borne out by the high authority of Lord Brougham, who,
in a speech which I have before quoted, thus expresses himself: "The
present system has grown out of ingenious devices to evade the
oppressions of feudal tyrants, but under it we are subject to the
tyranny of the legal profession, and burdens little less grievous. The
reform, to be effectual, must be thorough. <i>Delenda est Carthaga</i>
must be our motto."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAND_QUESTION_IN_NEW_SOUTH_WALES" id=
"THE_LAND_QUESTION_IN_NEW_SOUTH_WALES"></a>THE LAND QUESTION IN NEW
SOUTH WALES</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History
(Sir Henry Parkes, 1892), pp. 70-71, 81-90, 148, 153</p>

<p>On July 3, 1855, I, (Sir Henry Parkes) moved for the "appointment of
a Select Committee to enquire into the state of agriculture, with
special reference to the raising of wheaten grain, and to the causes of
hindrance or failure in that pursuit, whether arising from the habits
of the people, the policy of the Government, or the physical character
of the country." To understand the interest that fairly attached to my
motion, we must review, or rather glance at, the state of the colony.
The colony still included the whole of Queensland, and embraced an area
of 978,315 square miles. Men of leading positions with seats in the
Legislature, described it for the most part, as incapable of tillage,
and only fit for grazing sheep and cattle, and for "nomadic tribes." A
population not numbering more than 277,579 souls imported largely its
breadstuffs from South America and other foreign countries. It is now
well known that in all divisions of the colony&mdash;north, south, or
west&mdash;there are as rich wheat lands as in any part of the world;
but then the mass of the population were densely ignorant of the true
character of the country, and those who knew better, were in too many
instances personally interested in keeping them ignorant. The stories
that were told of the fruitless endeavours of industrious men to obtain
patches of land for a freehold home under the Order-in-Council seem, to
the present generation, like cruel bits of romance.</p>

<p align="center">APPENDIX TO EVIDENCE OF MR. J. ROBERTSON<br>
 (before Select Committee.)</p>

<p>On entering upon the subject under enquiry by the Committee, it is
my purpose to assume that the state of agriculture in general, and of
wheat culture in particular in the colony, is exceedingly
unsatisfactory, and, if not absolutely declining instead of
progressing, is at least so with reference to population. The causes of
hindrance or failure of agriculture generally, and of the raising of
wheat, in particular, I take to be the first and greatest, that for
many years the policy of the Government of the colony, whatever may
have been its object, has unquestionably tended not only to check the
formation of new agriculture establishments, but to depress existing
ones.</p>

<p>While the agriculturist has been absolutely excluded from leasing
any portion of the public land, and thwarted, harassed and dispirited
at every turn in his efforts to obtain the submittal of such lands to
sale, and subjected to public competition at auction before suffered
even then to purchase, the grazier has been allowed to use them under a
system of leases, affording him the greatest possible facility of
possession, and at the lowest imaginable rental, namely, at the rate of
10<i>s.</i> per annum for 640 acres, with the right, in an overwhelming
majority of cases, to purchase choice spots therefrom, without the
slightest delay or trouble and at the lowest legal price, namely,
20<i>s.</i> per acre, and absolutely without competition.</p>

<p>Some of the difficulties above alluded to, as attending the purchase
of a farm from the Crown, by any other than the favoured pastoral
class, may be stated thus: The person seeking to do so must first make
his selection&mdash;a matter not very easy of attainment, for persons
holding land in a neighbourhood, instead of helping with information,
almost invariably place every possible obstacle in the way of the
newcomer. The selection made, the next step to be taken is to apply by
letter to the Surveyor-General to have it measured. Shortly thereafter,
that officer will reply and inform the writer that his application has
been received and submitted to the District Surveyor for his report as
to whether the land is fit for agriculture, etc., etc. and that when it
is received the Surveyor-General will communicate the result,
intimating at the same time that, should the District-Surveyor consider
the land suitable for agriculture, and should there be no other
difficulty, such as its being held under a squatting lease, or any of
several others, it will be submitted to sale by auction.</p>

<p>The applicant may now expect to hear no more of the land for three
or four months, when, if all goes on favourably, he will be informed
that the District-Surveyor, having reported satisfactorily, has
received from the Surveyor-General instructions to measure it. Now
another wearying delay of several months' duration will in all
probability occur, before the expiration of which, if the applicant is
not a person possessed of considerable determination of character, he
will abandon, in despair, all hope of ever becoming an Australian
farmer, and help to swell one or other of our overgrown towns, by
accepting employment there. If, however, he possess sufficient
perseverance, he may visit the District-Surveyor, and probably learn
from him that the land cannot then be measured, because the district
under that officer is so very large, that it would be highly
inconvenient for him to move from one portion of it to another to
measure a single farm; that when several are applied for in the same
vicinity, he will proceed there; in the meantime he has several months'
work where he is, or the District-Surveyor may, after expressing
sympathy with the applicant's loss from delay, candidly assure him
that, in consequence of the great delay in receiving pay for his public
work, he is absolutely necessitated to accept private employment in
order to obtain sufficient cash to keep himself and party of four men
on, until the Government make him his remittance, now three or four
months due.</p>

<p>These and other preliminary difficulties the applicant must prepare
to encounter; but even when all are surmounted and the land measured
there will be two or three months' delay&mdash;in all probability
eighteen months or two years from the date of his first
application&mdash;before it is offered for sale. Then, at last, the
applicant will obtain his land, if he be fortunate enough to escape the
determined opposition of some wealthy person in the neighbourhood, or
has money enough, and determination enough to purchase it, that
opposition notwithstanding.</p>

<p>If it is a fact that the agricultural interests of the country are
subjected to more climatic difficulties than are the pastoral
interests, I take it that that circumstance cannot, properly, be
brought forward as a reason why the agricultural interest should not,
under our laws, have a fair field and no favour, as compared with the
pastoral interest, in entering the market to borrow money in time of
doubt and general want of confidence in monetary matters. If the
agriculturist, in borrowing money to secure his crop, has to encounter
a higher rate of interest than the grazier has to encounter, in
consequence of the risk of damage to his crops from an unfavourable
season being greater than the same in the case of the produce of the
grazier, surely there is no reason why he should be compelled to submit
to a still greater increase of interest, to compensate the capitalist
for the additional risk of the borrower's insolvency before the crops
are realised, especially when the grazier is, through the aid of "The
lien on Wool Act" exempted from paying for such risk.</p>

<p>The effects of the policy of the Government, which I have described,
may be found, on the one hand, in the fact that the number of persons
who have been bred to agricultural pursuits, at present residing in the
towns of the colony, is, beyond example, excessive, showing our social
conditions in that regard to be in a most unsatisfactory state; and, on
the other hand, in the other fact, that the wholesale price of flour in
the colony is three times higher, per pound, than the wholesale price
of animal food, of the very best description&mdash;a state of things
not to be found in any other civilized country.</p>

<p>I am aware that the deficiency of agriculture, which is so
remarkable in this country, is attributed to the aridity of the climate
by many gentlemen whose experience entitles their opinions to respect;
but, as I have during the eighteen years last past annually cultivated
and sown with wheat a large quantity of land, in various parts of the
Upper Hunter District&mdash;a district generally considered to be
unfavourable for the purpose&mdash;and have, in that long period, only
failed twice in obtaining crops, and have reaped two self-sown, which
in a great measure compensated for even their loss. I can come to no
other conclusion than that, whatever may be the disadvantages of the
climate they are not sufficient to cause such neglect of agriculture as
has occurred.</p>

<p>On the whole, I am confident that the difficulties placed in the way
of agriculture by the climate are as nothing compared with the
overwhelming obstacles furnished by the policy of the Legislature and
Government of the Colony.</p>

<p>Before concluding this communication, I cannot resist the
opportunity it affords to place on record my opinion, that even should
all other means fail of providing the country with an ample supply of
agricultural produce, a remedy may be found by allowing any person to
enter upon and occupy 80 acres of waste land, without competition or
delay, and pay for it at the upset price, four years thereafter;
provided that he clears and cultivates 10 acres the first year, and 10
additional acres in each of the three succeeding years, and is at the
end of the time residing on the spot.</p>

<p class='right'>JOHN ROBERTSON.</p>

<p>Yarrundi, Aug. 6th, 1855.</p>

<p>I also gave my general support to the Robertson Land Bill, which
passed through a determined opposition, and became law eventually,
after the violent expedient of "swamping the Upper House," which
swamping, however, had no practical or immediate effect, as the old
members, including the President, retired in a body when the new
members attempted to take their seats. By the Constitution, the first
Council was appointed for five years only, and the term was near its
expiration when this historical incident occurred. So nothing could be
done with the Bill, or anything else, until the next Council was
appointed, whose term was for life.</p>

<p>Sir John Robertson's Act did immense good. Its broad scope was to
enable men to select land for themselves in blocks from 40 to 320
acres, at &pound;1 per acre, without waiting for any surveyor or other
Government official, but subject to the conditions of a deposit of
5<i>s.</i> an acre, actual residence and improvements to the value of
&pound;1 per acre in value. The balance of the purchase-money was to
remain for a time, not limited by date, at 5% interest. It is no figure
of speech to say that this law unlocked the lands to the industrious
settler, and notwithstanding the abuses which too widely grew up, it
was the means of bringing into existence hundreds of comfortable homes
in all parts of the colony where the name of its author is held in
grateful remembrance. It will have been seen in a previous chapter what
a network of difficulties surrounded the man of small means who tried
to obtain a rural home in former years; and perhaps the highest tribute
to the memory of Sir John Robertson is that, after all the amendments
which have been carried, the chief principles of his Act are still
imbedded in the law of the country.</p>

<i>Jan. 6th, 1860.</i><br>
(Received <i>March 12, 1860.</i>)</p>

<p>My Lord Duke,</p>

<p>In my Despatch, No. 3, of the 28th November ultimo, I mentioned that
extensive districts within the colony of Queensland are well adapted
for the growth of the sugar cane among a variety of other produce.</p>

<p>2. Since I wrote the above Despatch, I have seen three specimens of
the sugar cane, which have been grown near the town of Maryborough.
These specimens, which were finer than any that were shown me at
Mauritius, were forwarded to Sir William Macarthur, a gentleman of
large property, well-known ability, and great experience in scientific
and agricultural pursuits; and who was Commissioner for New South Wales
at the Paris Exhibition of 1855. I have received permission to transmit
to your Grace the following extract from a letter containing Sir
William Macarthur's opinion of the samples submitted to him:&mdash;"I
yesterday made several trials of the juice of the sugar cane forwarded
by Mr. Aldridge, of Maryborough.</p>

<p>"As I had to extract the juice by pounding the cane in a mortar, I
only experimented upon the largest and the smallest of the three
forwarded. As they appear to have excited some attention, I may mention
that they were quite ripe, of a bright, yellowish-brown colour, with
the joints from two to five inches apart, the largest being about ten
feet long, not quite eight inches in circumference, and weighing just
eighteen pounds. About three feet of the upper end, however, was too
short-jointed to yield abundantly, and hardly ripe.</p>

<p>"The walls of this cane were exceedingly thick, giving it great
stiffness, and solidity to resist storms of wind. It proved to be
hardly so juicy as I expected.</p>

<p>"I understood you to say that these canes had been produced in eight
or nine months from being planted, and without any particular care.</p>

<p>"Taking this for granted, there can be no question, I think, that
with sufficient capital, and under efficient management, the
cultivation of the cane for sugar ought to prove one of the most
profitable arrangements which offer themselves in Australia, I mean at
Maryborough, or other places equally well situated on the North-eastern
coast. I have for many years thought that sugar plantations to the
northward of Moreton Bay ought to be highly remunerative. The climate
is favourable; there is no lack of good land, and unlike the Mauritius,
we never hear of the ravages of hurricanes."</p>

<p>3. The opinion of so high an authority as Sir William Macarthur
coupled with a number of facts within my knowledge, leave no doubt in
my mind that, when Capital and Labour shall have been introduced, the
cultivation of sugar may be carried on in this colony, with at least
equal success as at Mauritius, and on a vastly more extensive scale
than in that island.</p>

<p>4. I beg to subjoin a short description of the district of Wide Bay,
or Maryborough (referred to above) condensed from a recent publication
by a writer of local knowledge and competent authority.</p>

<p>The back country is extensive, its capabilities are so well known we
need not dwell upon them. The soil on the branches of the River Mary
and its tributary creeks, and within easy approach to the same is
excellent and in large quantities. Its producing capabilities may be
illustrated by the following facts: In one piece of ground may be seen
growing in perfection the sugar cane, cotton plant, grasscloth plant,
arrowroot, tascan wheat, yams, sweet potatoes, cassava, custard apples,
pine apples, banana, guava, and many other tropical productions;
alongside of which may be seen turnips, wheat, barley, mangel-wurzel,
English potatoes, artichokes (Jerusalem), broad beans, maize, etc. At
the same place a crop of maize (which was estimated to yield from 80 to
100 bushels to the acre) is in a forward state of ripening, and from
the same piece of ground, three crops of maize have been gathered
within the twelve months. Where is there another river in Australia
with capabilities for the growth of such varied productions, each
perfect of its kind, and such facilities for shipping, by vessels of
the largest tonnage, the produce direct to any part of the world? Wheat
has been only grown in small patches&mdash;each time, however, with
success. Cotton was here produced in the same way from a few plants,
and pronounced by competent judges to be of the finest quality both in
staple and texture. Equally favourable results have been obtained with
the other products named above. The particulars of climate I give from
a resident of the township of Maryborough for a period of twelve years
before the place was surveyed, who declares his own health and the
health of his wife and children to have been excellent, and better than
he or they ever had before, that he has never experienced a hot wind in
the place and that the sudden changes of temperature as felt in Sydney
are never felt in this favoured locality: that the rain showers are
regular and abundant, more so than in any other place he has been in,
in this colony; hence the extraordinary growth of vegetables, etc.
Eight months in the year, not a finer climate can be found in the
world, and the remaining four summer months are not so oppressive in
their effects as in the other warm countries, from the temperature
being more uniform, and the purity of the atmosphere so great. The same
gentleman declares that he has, upon his occasional visits, experienced
the heat in Sydney much more oppressive. Great natural capabilities
exist in the township of Maryborough for the formation of dams at a
trifling expense, which would collect large bodies of water. Minerals
consisting of gold, copper, iron, and coal have been procured in
several places in the district. Timber exists of cedar, cowrie, and
hoop pine, a white hardwood known as fluidoza, gums, dye woods, and
other most useful and valuable cabinet woods, are to be found in great
abundance. The dugong is found in large numbers in Hervey's Bay, from
which the famed oil is manufactured, also the pearl oyster.</p>

<p>All these are sources from which wealth will be derived, and which
will afford employment to a large population. As to the aborigines of
this district it may be placed to their credit, that they are willing
at times to work, and even well. The steamer which trades to the place
every fortnight always takes from Frazer's Island a number of them to
discharge and load the vessel. They are also largely used in the town
for cutting wood, drawing water, bullock driving, horse riding, and
breaking up the ground in the gardens.</p>

<p>The population and trade of the town of Maryborough are rapidly
increasing. The source from which the business is at present entirely
derived is the pastoral or squatting interest, leaving all other
valuable and important interests to be yet developed, such as
agriculture, mining, fisheries, and the timber trade. A large
agricultural population may be expected to settle themselves down on
the river. Maryborough has been recently proclaimed as one of the great
towns wherein District Courts are to be held. The exports are wool,
tallow, etc., with great power of expansion.</p>

<p>6. I beg to suggest that a copy of this Despatch, together with a
copy of my Despatch of even date herewith, respecting the cultivation
of cotton in this colony, should be transmitted to the Royal

<p>In continuation of my former Despatches No. 5 of the 19th and No. 8
of the 23rd Dec., 1859, and No. 18 of the 4th February, ult., I have
the honour to enclose copies of the Addresses presented to me at the
three towns of Warwick, Drayton, and Toowoomba, which I visited during
an official tour of inspection, from which I have lately returned.</p>

<p>2. It will be satisfactory to the Queen and to Her Majesty's
Government, to receive these further proofs of the affectionate loyalty
of the people of this colony towards Her Majesty's throne and person
and (I may, perhaps, be permitted to add) of their confidence in the
arrangement made, under Her Majesty's favour, for their Government.</p>

<p>3. My recent journey extended through those districts of Queensland,
which have been longest settled and are mostly thickly inhabited. I was
everywhere received with cordial hospitality by the principal settlers,
and with loyal enthusiasm by all classes of the community. The numerous
cavalcades of hundreds of well-mounted horsemen, which came forth to
meet and escort the first representative of their Sovereign, presented
spectacles such as can be exhibited in only two countries in the
world&mdash;in England and in Australia.</p>

<p>4. As it was during your Grace's first administration of the
Colonial Department that the wishes of the Australian Colonists were
crowned by the concession of responsible Government, I will take leave
to draw your attention to a paragraph in one of the enclosures, which
explains a sentiment generally entertained by this people.</p>

<p>After stating that "the journey of his Excellency has been one
continued ovation from beginning to end"; that "all classes have vied
in doing honour to the representative of the Queen"; and that "all
little sectarian differences, petty jealousies, and presumed rival
interests have been merged in the laudable wish to give our first
Governor a hearty welcome"; the "Darling Downs Gazette" proceeds as
follows: "Not the least pleasing reflection that suggests itself when
reviewing these demonstrations of general joy is the confirmation of
the fact, now so long and in so many lands established, that those
descended from the old stock at home, to whom self-government has been
a timely concession, not a charter wrung from the Mother country by the
force of arms, still recognize and revere the grand old institutions,
which have made England the greatest power on earth."</p>

<p>14. I have described in a former Despatch, that rich pastoral
District of the tableland which is known as the "Darling Downs." The
droughts and the epidemic diseases which are frequently fatal to sheep
and cattle in other parts of Australia seem alike unknown in this
favoured region. Many large fortunes have been amassed there during the
last 15 years.</p>

<p>15. While the impression created on my mind by the journey across
the Darling Downs was still fresh, I stated in my reply to the Drayton
address, that it had "filled me with surprise and admiration". Even
before I left England I knew by report the rich natural resources and
the picturesque beauty of this district, the scenery of which vividly
recalls to my mind the classic plains of Thessaly. But I confess that I
was not fully prepared for so wonderfully rapid an advance in all that
can promote and adorn civilization, an advance which has taken place
during the fourth part of an average lifetime. Not only have I seen
vast herds of horses and cattle, and countless flocks of sheep
overspreading the valleys and forests, which, within the memory of
persons who have yet scarcely attained to the age of manhood, were
tenanted only by wild animals, and by a few wandering tribes of
savages; not only have I travelled over roads beyond all comparison
superior to the means of communication which existed less than a
century ago in many parts of the United Kingdom; not only have I beheld
flourishing towns arising in spots where hardly 20 years back the foot
of a white man had never yet trodden the primeval wilderness; not only
have I admired these and other proofs of material progress, but I have
also found in the houses of the long chain of settlers who have
entertained me with such cordial hospitality, all the comforts, and
most of the luxuries and refinements of the houses of country gentlemen
in England. The wonderful advance of this portion of the colony during
the last 10 years, is due to no sudden and fortuitous discovery of the
precious metals; it is derived wholly from the blessing of Providence
on the skill and energy of its inhabitants, in subduing and
replenishing the earth. Assuredly, I have observed during the past week
very remarkable illustrations of the proverbial genius of the
Anglo-Saxon race for the noble and truly imperial art of
colonization.</p>

<p>Owing to the lack of the political traditions of the English
Parliament friction was bound to rise between the Houses of the
colonial Legislatures. A bill to provide temporarily for the payment of
members had been passed several times by the Victorian Parliament, but
the Council was opposed to making a permanent provision for the
purpose. In 1877 Sir Graham Berry tacked the measure to the annual
appropriation bill, which was consequently rejected by the Council.</p>

Excellency the Governor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TO HIS EXCELLENCY SIR GEORGE FERGUSON BOWEN, KNIGHT GRAND CROSS OF
THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ORDER OF ST. MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE, and
Commander-in-Chief in and over the Colony of Victoria and its
Dependencies and Vice-Admiral of the same, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>May it please your Excellency,</p>

<p>We her Most Gracious Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the
members of the Legislative Council of Victoria, in Parliament assembled
beg leave to approach Your Excellency with renewed assurances of
unabated loyalty to Her Majesty's Throne and Person.</p>

<p>We desire to draw Your Excellency's attention to the answer given by
the Hon. the Post-Master General during the sitting of the Council on
the 1st instant to the question put by one of our members,
viz.:&mdash;Whether it is the intention of the Ministry to afford this
House the opportunity of considering the propriety of renewing or
discontinuing the payment of members of Parliament by submitting the
measure by Bill as heretofore.</p>

<p>The answer was as follows:&mdash;In reply to the Hon. Member the
Cabinet desire me to state that it is unusual and inexpedient to state
the intention of the Government otherwise than by the due presentation
of business to Parliament; but in this instance there is an additional
serious objection to the question of the hon. member. It deals with the
appropriation of revenue which is the exclusive privilege of the
Legislative Assembly, and it is highly undesirable that the Legislative
Council should interfere even by a question with appropriation, the
initiation of which is by message from the Crown, on the advice of the
responsible Ministers and is further controlled by the exclusive
privileges of the Assembly.</p>

<p>This being the opinion of Your Excellency's advisers, were we to
continue silent it might with some show of reason be inferred that we
were satisfied with the answer of the Government, and would accept
their dictum as representing the true position of the matter as between
the two Chambers.</p>

<p>We have thought it incumbent upon us to lay before Your Excellency
the following circumstances connected with the question of payment of
members:&mdash;In the session of 1860-1, a separate Bill for payment of
members was introduced into the Assembly, but was lost in the Council.
In the session 1861, Sir Henry Barkly, who was then Governor, was
warned by the Legislative Council of the inevitable consequences of a
sum being included in the annual Estimates of Expenditure for the
compensation of members of Parliament, and the objectionable item was
not included in the Estimates for the year when laid before the
Assembly that session.</p>

<p>On five subsequent occasions separate Bills for the same object have
been sent up from the Legislative Assembly, three of which were
rejected, and the two last were passed by the Legislative Council, but
on both these occasions the principal supporters of the Bills
distinctly stated that their votes were given on the understanding that
the measures were to be tentative only, and limited in their
duration.</p>

<p>The question at the present time is in exactly the same position as
it was when originated in 1861, and is still in the region of
experimental legislation. It is not a mere question of the
appropriation of the public revenue, but of public policy upon which an
uniform usage has been adopted in the colony, with the concurrence of
both Houses, with the marked co-operation of Her Majesty's
Representative in 1861.</p>

<p>The usage, moreover, is in strict conformity with the Royal
Instructions which direct that "in the passing of all laws each
different matter must be provided for by a different law without
intermixing such things as have no proper relation to each other, and
that no clause or clauses be inserted in, or annexed to any Act which
shall be foreign to what the title of that Act imports."</p>

<p>We desire to inform Your Excellency that we claim the right to
exercise the same free and deliberate vote on any Bill which may be
submitted to us for providing compensation to members of Parliament as
we have exercised on all previous occasions and we submit that the
inclusion of a sum for that purpose in the Annual Appropriation Bill
might make such procedure the instrument of enabling one branch of the
Legislature to coerce the other.</p>

<p align="center">To the Right Hon. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Bart,
M.P.</p>

<p align="center">Government House, Melb. <i>April 12th, 1878.</i></p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>On the 29th ultimo I forwarded to you a telegram announcing the
happy termination, through a fair compromise honourable to both sides,
of the protracted crisis and "deadlock" between the two Houses of
Parliament, which had caused so much excitement and agitation, and so
much suffering and loss in this community, and which was straining the
constitution of this Colony to a degree which it could not have endured
for long.</p>

<p>Ever since December constant efforts have been made to induce the
conflicting Houses to agree to an honourable compromise of their
differences. Personally I omitted no proper opportunity of recommending
mutual forbearance and mutual concessions. It was proposed on behalf of
the Ministry and the Assembly that the Council should agree to pass the
separate Bill sent up to them in December, and that the assembly should
simultaneously, or as nearly so as might be, appoint a Committee to
search for the Appropriation Bill which had been "laid aside" and
should then reenact that Bill without the item objected to by the Upper
House. The Ministers, a strong minority of the Councillors, the
Assembly, and the general public&mdash;all united in pressing the
Council to accept this arrangement, but there were many disappointing
delays and failures in the negotiations.</p>

<p>Finally, however, all difficulties were overcome, and both the
separate Bill continuing the reimbursement of the expense of members
and the annual Appropriation Act have become law.</p>

<p>General satisfaction has been felt and everywhere expressed at this
termination of the late dangerous and disastrous parliamentary
"deadlock," and the political and social animosities caused by it are
already fast subsiding. The country is tranquil and generally
prosperous. Before the commencement of the political crisis there had
been a partial depression in trade and depreciation in the value of
certain kinds of property, in consequence of a long drought succeeded
by very heavy floods, and from other temporary causes. These evils had
been aggravated by the sense of uncertainty rather than of insecurity
produced by the fierce and protracted political and social agitation
and antagonism of the last four months. But a young and strong
community like that of Victoria, full of life and energy, and of that
general good humour which flows from the habitual prosperity of all
classes, rapidly recovers from depression and discontent, however
caused.</p>

<p>It has been very satisfactory to me to receive the assurances that
throughout the late financial deadlock, no public money has been
expended except in due form of law, and in strict accordance with
parliamentary usage. Those public works which had been legally provided
for by Railway and Loan Acts, or otherwise, have been carried on
without interruption; while by dint of strict economy and of the large
retrenchments in the civil service effected by the Ministry, the
administration of justice and of the several departments of the
Government has proceeded regularly and without intermission.</p>

<p>In a speech delivered in last October before the actual beginning of
the recent crisis, but in anticipation of its near approach, I
recommended the members of both Houses of Parliament and of both
political parties to lay to heart the subjoined passage in one of Mr.
J.S. Mill's works:</p>

<p>"One of the most indispensable requisites in the practical conduct
of politics, especially in the management of free institutions, is
conciliation, a readiness to compromise, a willingness to concede
something to opponents, and to shape good measures so as to be as
little offensive as possible to persons of opposite views, and of this
salutary habit the mutual 'give and take' (as it has been called)
between two Houses is a perpetual school; useful as such even now, and
its utility would probably be more felt in a more democratic
constitution of the Legislature." Nor have I ever ceased to urge the
adoption of such principles as those laid down by Mr. Merivale when he
wrote "Moderation in success, self-denial in the exercise of power,
habitual consideration for the opinions and feelings of others,
readiness to compromise differences, love of justice and fair play,
reluctance to push principles to extremes, the moral courage which will
dare to stand up against a majority, the habit of constantly, and, as
it were instinctively postponing self to the public interest, and this
whether arising from moral choice or from the constraint imposed by
public opinion; these are the balancing qualities which prevent the
misuse of political freedom."</p>

<p>With regard to the opinions which I have formed concerning the
proper position and mutual relations of the two Houses of the Victorian
Parliament, it will be remembered that my opinions are identical with
those placed on record on that subject by the late Lord Canterbury, my
able and experienced predecessor in my present office. It will also be
recollected that I have steadily followed, during the crisis of 1877-8,
the precedents made, and the constitutional course pursued by Lord
Canterbury during the previous crisis of 1867-8. In acknowledging Lord
Canterbury's despatch of 18th July, 1868, reporting the termination of
the crisis of 1867-8, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies (the
Duke of Buckingham) wrote as follows:</p>

<p>"I have to express my approval of your firm adherence to your
constitutional position through these trying discussions; and I learn
with satisfaction the cessation of a state of affairs which has been
productive of so much inconvenience in the Colony."</p>

<p>Having pursued exactly the same course and acted on exactly the same
principles with my predecessor, I am confident that I shall receive
similar personal support. Moreover, I submit that it is of supreme
importance, on public grounds, that the people of the Australasian
Colonies should know that the actions and conduct of successive
Governors are not prompted by the personal views or idiosyncrasies of
individuals, but that they are guided by a consistent and uniform
policy, sanctioned by the authority of the Imperial Government.</p>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;New Guinea. By Charles Lyne (special
representative of the "Sydney Morning Herald"), pp. 1-28</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1882, the Queensland Government took alarm at certain rumours of
the intention of Germany to annex New Guinea, but for a time the
British Government refused to move. When the establishment of a
protectorate was authorized, only the southeastern portion of the
island was available, Germany having, in the meantime, annexed the
northern part and the group of Islands known as New Britain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commodore Erskine in H.M.S. <i>Nelson</i> arrived at Port Moresby on
Sunday, the 2nd of November, 1884, and the Union Jack now flies from
the flagstaff at the mission station, the Proclamation of a British
Protectorate having been made with much ceremony on Thursday Nov.
6.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday afternoon, the chiefs and a number of other natives
were brought on board the H.M.S. <i>Nelson</i>, and a grand assembly
took place, with a feast for the chiefs and an address from the
Commodore, a presentation of gifts attractive to the native eye, and
the firing of some of the ships' guns. The flags of various nations
were hung over the quarter-deck in the form of an awning, and the
officers wore frock-coats and swords. Most of the chiefs were destitute
of clothing, the mop-like hair and foreheads of some of them being
bound round with bands of small shells and the hair ornamented with
tufts of feathers. Two or three wore old shirts, and one, Boe Vagi, the
chief of the Port Moresby natives, who was appointed by the Commodore
to be the head chief of the Motu tribe, was dressed in a shirt, with a
handkerchief round his loins, a red felt hat on his head, and some
green leaves through the lobe of his left ear. Evidently he had been
attired specially for the occasion, as his usual dress is as scanty as
that of his fellows. There were in all about fifty of the chiefs, most
of them being representatives of the Motu tribe; and after having been
permitted to look round the ship, they were directed by the
missionaries, Messrs. Lawes and Chalmers, to seat themselves upon the
deck. Then a great tub of boiled rice, sweetened with brown sugar, was
brought on deck, and basins of this mixture were handed round to the
chiefs who received them, and devoured the rice with evident
satisfaction. Ships' biscuits were also served out, and the scene
presented by the feasting savages, and by the grouping of the
<i>Nelson's</i> officers and the parading of the bluejackets on the
opposite side of the deck&mdash;so that a photograph might be taken of
the whole assembly&mdash;was exceedingly interesting and
picturesque.</p>

<p>When the feasting was over, Commodore Erskine came upon deck, and
the chief, Boe Vagi, having been invited by Mr. Lawes to come forward,
the Commodore addressed him, and his fellow chiefs, and said:</p>

<p>"I have asked you to come on board to-day in order that I may
explain to you about the ceremony which will take place to-morrow on
shore. I have been sent to this place to notify and proclaim that Her
Majesty the Queen has established a Protectorate over the southern
shores of New Guinea, and in token of that event I am directed to hoist
the British flag at Port Moresby, and at other places along the coast
and islands. To-morrow, then, I intend to hoist the English flag here,
and to read a Proclamation which will be duly translated to you. I
desire, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, to explain to you the
meaning of the ceremonial which you are about to witness. It is a
proclamation that from this time forth you are placed under the
protection of Her Majesty's Government; that evil-disposed men will not
be able to occupy your country, to seize your lands, or to take you
away from your own homes. I have been instructed to say to you that
what you have seen done here to-day on board Her Majesty's ship of war,
and which will be done again to-morrow on shore, is to give you the
strongest assurance of Her Majesty's gracious protection of you, and to
warn bad and evil-disposed men that if they attempt to do you harm,
they will be promptly punished by the officers of the Queen. Your lands
will be secured to you; your wives and children will be protected.
Should any injury be done to you, you will immediately inform Her
Majesty's officers, who will reside amongst you, and they will hear
your complaints, and do you justice. You will look upon all white
persons whom the Queen permits to reside amongst you as your friends,
and Her Majesty's subjects. The Queen will permit nobody to reside here
who does you injury. You will under no circumstances inflict punishment
upon any white person; but if such person has done you wrong you will
tell Her Majesty's officers of that wrong in order that the case may be
fairly inquired into. You must know that it is for your security, and
to prevent bloodshed, that the Queen sends me here to you, and will
send her officers to live amongst you. And now I hope that you clearly
understand that we are here amongst you as your friends. You will all
keep peace amongst yourselves, and if you have disputes with each
other, you will bring them before the Queen's officers who will settle
them for you without bloodshed. Should bad men come amongst you,
bringing firearms and gunpowder, and intoxicating liquors, you are not
to buy them, and are to give notice at once to the Queen's officers, so
that such men may be punished. Always keep in your minds that the Queen
guards and watches over you, looks upon you as her children, and will
not allow anyone to harm you, and will soon send her trusted officers
to carry out her gracious intentions in the establishment of this
Protectorate."</p>

<p>At the Commodore's request Mr. Lawes read a translation of this
address in the Motu language, the chiefs listening attentively: then
calling the chief, Boe Vagi, forward, Commodore Erskine shook hands
with him, and introduced him to Mr. Romilly; and the Commodore's
intimation of the appointment of a High Commissioner for New Guinea and
his explanation of Mr. Romilly's position, were interpreted to the
chiefs by Mr. Lawes. This was followed by the appointment of Boe Vagi
as head chief of the Motu tribe. To make his appointment more distinct,
he was presented with an emblem of authority in the form of an ebony
stick with a florin let in at the top, the Queen's head being
uppermost, and encircled by a band of silver. Handing to Boe Vagi this
stick, the Commodore said: "I present him with this stick, which is to
be an emblem to him of his authority; and all the tribes who are
represented by the chiefs here are to look to the holder of this stick,
Boe Vagi. This stick represents the Queen's head, the Queen of England;
and if at any time any of the people of these tribes have any grievance
or anything to say, they are, through this man, the holder of this
stick, Boe Vagi, to make it known to the Queen's officers, in order
that it may be inquired into. This stick is to be the symbol of his
authority, and all the tribes are to have communication through him
with the Queen's officer."</p>

<p>Directed then to descend to the main deck the chiefs walked one
after another into the Commodore's cabin, where each received a present
consisting of a tomahawk, a butcher's knife, a coloured shirt, or a
piece of coloured cloth, and some figs of twist tobacco. It was a
curious sight to see these chiefs, some of them very old men, but
others young, erect and muscular, filing in at one door, and after
shaking hands with the Commodore and receiving a present, leaving by
the other; and it was very amusing to notice how startled some of them
were at suddenly discovering themselves in a large pier-glass, which
they had to pass before leaving the cabin. The Commodore did not fail
to point out through Mr. Lawes to the chief who had burnt the village
of another, that for the future he would not be allowed to commit such
an act, and must through the Queen's officers seek redress for any
grievance he might have; and the man was evidently impressed by what
was said to him.</p>

<p>At half-past six next morning the landing of officers and men of the
squadron for the purpose of publicly proclaiming the establishment of
the Protectorate, and hoisting the British flag, commenced. The general
order issued by the Commodore directed that the dress for officers
should be cocked hat, undress coat, and epaulettes; the dress for
seamen white frocks and hats, and that for marines white tunics and
helmets. There was, consequently, a very attractive display of
uniforms, and altogether it was an exceedingly interesting spectacle.
The early hour appointed for the landing permitted of the ceremony
being performed at a time when the heat, which was intense while the
<i>Nelson</i> was on the coast, was not likely to be very trying to the
men. The water of the harbour lay placid as a lake, with the ships of
war far out from the shore, and here and there native canoes moving
slowly along or resting idly on the surface; and the hills and valleys
were green and shaded from the sun, and wore that refreshing appearance
which is notable when the trees and the grass have been bathed in dew,
and when the sun's rays are strong enough only to make the dewdrops
sparkle, and to deepen the shadows in the recesses where the sunlight
has not yet penetrated.</p>

<p>The boats conveying the officers and men to the shore, each flying
the white ensign, imparted life and colour to the scene upon the water,
and nothing could be more picturesque and beautiful than the view on
shore, where the houses of the native villages bordering the beach,
with their brown occupants gazing in amazement on what was taking place
before them, were shaded by a grove of cocoanut palms, the refreshing
dark green fronds being rivalled only by the lighter green of the
plantations of the banana trees on the sides of the hills, which,
rising high above the village, were, notwithstanding the evidence of
cultivation by the natives, and the existence of the little mission
settlement, dressed in almost all their native loveliness, and robed in
delicately-tinted morning mists.</p>

<p>Inside the enclosed ground stood the mission house, and on a spot
commanding a view of almost the entire harbour was the flagstaff which
was now to display the flag hoisted with the authority of the Queen by
Commodore Erskine; and it was around this flagstaff that the troops
were drawn up in a hollow square, the men facing inwards, with the
officers to the front, and the Commodore and his suite standing with
the missionaries and Mr. Chester on the verandah of the mission house.
The native chiefs who had been on board the <i>Nelson</i> were seated
in a picturesque group on the ground immediately in front of the
Commodore; and other natives and a few white spectators stood in a
crowd at the rear of the blue-jackets. The only representative of
English women present was Mrs. Lawes, wife of the Rev. W.G. Lawes, who
was accommodated with a chair, and sat near the Commodore and the
officers on either side of him.</p>

<p>Immediately the blue-jackets had landed they were marched up the
hill to the mission compound, but the marines remained upon the beach
until the Commodore landed, when they presented arms, and afterwards,
with bayonets fixed, marched with the band to join the bluejackets in
front of the mission house.</p>

<p>On the Commodore appearing before the troops they presented arms,
and he then read the following proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="center">"PROCLAMATION.</p>

<p>"Proclamation on behalf of her Most Gracious Majesty Victoria, by
the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
Queen, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India, establishing a
Protectorate of Her Most Gracious Majesty over a portion of New Guinea,
and the Islands adjacent thereto.</p>

<p>"To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting:</p>

<p>"Whereas it has become essential, for the protection of the lives
and properties of the native inhabitants of New Guinea, and for the
purpose of preventing the occupation of portions of that country by
persons whose proceedings unsanctioned by any lawful authority might
tend to injustice, strife and bloodshed, and who, under the pretence of
legitimate trade and intercourse, might endanger the liberties, and
possess themselves of the lands of such native inhabitants, that a
British Protectorate should be established over a certain portion of
such country and the islands adjacent thereto.</p>

<p>"And whereas Her Majesty, having taken into her gracious
consideration the urgent necessity of her protection to such
inhabitants has directed me to proclaim such protection in a formal
manner at this place: Now, I, James Elphinstone Erskine, Captain in the
Royal Navy, and Commodore of the Australian Station, one of Her
Majesty's naval aides-de-camp, do hereby, in the name of Her Most
Gracious Majesty, declare and proclaim the establishment of such
Protectorate over such portions of the coast and the adjacent islands
as is more particularly described in the schedule hereunto annexed.</p>

<p>"And I hereby proclaim and declare that no acquisition of land
whensoever or howsoever acquired, within the limits of the Protectorate
hereby established, will be recognized by Her Majesty; And I do hereby,
on behalf of Her Majesty, command and enjoin all persons whom it may
concern to take notice of this Proclamation."</p>

<p align="center">"SCHEDULE.</p>

<p>"All that portion of the southern shores of New Guinea commencing
from the boundary of that portion of the country claimed by the
Government of the Netherlands on the 141st meridian of east longitude
to East Cape, with all islands adjacent thereto south of East Cape to
Kosman Island inclusive, together with the islands in the Goschen
Straits.</p>

<p>"Given on board Her Majesty's ship <i>Nelson</i>, at the harbour of
Port Moresby, on the 6th day of November 1884.</p>

<p class='right'>"(Signed) JAMES ELPHINSTONE ERSKINE.<br>
"Commodore.</p>

<p align="center">"God Save the Queen."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was interpreted to the natives by the Rev. W.G. Lawes, who, at
the request of Commodore Erskine, had translated it into the Motu
language, and then, by direction of the Commodore, the Union Jack was
slowly raised to the truck of the flagstaff.</p>

<p>All this not a little astonished the natives, though some of those
whose homes were at Port Moresby had witnessed the firing of a
<i>feu-de-joie</i> before; but though the firing startled some of them
it had, with the general display, the effect of impressing them all
with some sense of the solemn importance of the ceremony that was being
performed. The firing party were then ordered to shoulder arms, and the
Commodore, addressing all present at the ceremony but the natives,
said:</p>

<p>"Officers and men, Mr. Romilly and Gentlemen, This interesting and
important ceremony now formally concluded, it only remains for me, in
Her Majesty's name to express the fervent hope that under the blessing
of Almighty God the establishment of this Protectorate may conduce to
the peace, happiness and welfare of the people of this vast territory.
May the British flag which we have this day planted on these shores be
to the people of this portion of New Guinea the symbol of their freedom
and their liberty, and the Proclamation which I have just read, the
charter of their rights and privileges. May it be to them a
Protectorate in deed, as well as in name, protecting them alike from
the encroachment of foreigners and the aggressive or unlawful actions
of any other nationality; may the blessings of civilization and
Christianity, the seeds of which have been already sown by English
hands in the persons of the brave and good men present on this
occasion, increase and multiply exceedingly amongst them; and lastly,
as the Union Jack which has on several former occasions been hoisted on
the shores of New Guinea and the adjacent islands is on this day for
the first time displayed and hoisted on New Guinea under the authority
and by the command of her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, I most
fervently pray that the establishment of a British Protectorate on
these shores may tend to insure the integrity and inviolability of the
great Australian Colonies, and promote the best interests of their
people; and I trust that this important step may be attended with the
happiest results, and redound to the honour of Her Most Gracious
Majesty the Queen, for whom I now invite you to give three hearty
cheers."</p>

<p>The call was right loyally responded to, and with Captain Bridge
leading, three British cheers rang out and echoed among the hills; and
then, with a royal salute, the troops once more presenting arms, the
ceremony was brought to a close.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After self-government had been granted to the Australian colonies,
the need for united action in certain matters became apparent. Under
the leadership of Sir Henry Parkes a strong movement for federation was
organized. His labour bore fruit in the meeting of the National
Australasian Convention in 1891. At this assembly were passed the
resolutions which form the foundation of the Federation Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>March 3rd.</i> Mr. Munro rose to move:</p>

<p>That, the Honourable Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G., Premier of New
South Wales, do take the chair as President of this National
Australasian Convention.</p>

<p>He said: I think this is a fitting honour to confer upon the author
of the movement on the part of these Australian colonies, which
resulted in the Conference held in Melbourne last year. The hon.
gentleman has taken a deep interest in the subject of federation for a
great number of years, and we, moreover, meet in the colony of which he
has the honour to be Premier. I have no doubt that in the position of
president he will aid us with his council and advice, and that his
occupancy of the chair will reflect credit upon our proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. Dibbs: We look to Sir Henry Parkes as, to some extent, the
architect of the structure we are about to build, and we, like the
other gentlemen present, look to our Premier for advice and
explanation, and hope that he will in due time place before us such a
programme as will enable us to proceed with the great work before us; I
can assure the honourable gentleman that we appreciate the compliment
paid to the Colony through our Premier, and personally I have great
pleasure in supporting the proposition which has been made.</p>

<p>Question resolved in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The President elect, being conducted to the chair by the Hon. James
Munro, and the Hon. Sir Samuel Griffith, said:</p>

<p>Mr. Munro, Sir Samuel Griffith, and honourable gentlemen, I could
not, under any circumstances, do other than yield to your unanimous
choice. I am very conscious indeed of my disqualifications for the
office of President. It is hardly in my nature to observe that studied
decorum which is so shining a quality in the Chair. I have not been
fitted for that situation in life. I therefore feel how great the
honour is to be placed in that position on this great occasion and by
this great body. I shall trust to that generous unanimity which has
prevailed in carrying this motion to support me in discharging duties
in the Chair, duties which may become onerous; and I am quite sure I
shall not trust in vain. It becomes my duty to give this assurance,
that so far as I know myself, I will command myself to do the duties of
this Chair so that there shall be no cause of complaint. I will try to
conduct the business as to offend none, and, if possible, secure the
good opinion which appears to have been formed to-day. I thank the
honourable gentlemen for the great distinction you have conferred upon
me, and I trust none of you will see cause to regret the vote you have
given.</p>

<p><i>March 4th.</i> Sir Henry Parkes: I have the honor to move,</p>

<p>That in order to establish and secure an enduring foundation for the
structure of a federal government, the principles embodied in the
following resolutions be agreed to:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in respect to
such surrenders as may be agreed upon as necessary, and incidental to
the power and authority of the National Federal Government.</p>

<p>2. That the trade and intercourse between the federated colonies
whether by means of land carriage or coastal navigation shall be
absolutely free.</p>

<p>3. That the power and authority to impose customs duties shall be
exclusively lodged in the Federal Government and Parliament, subject to
such disposal of the revenues thence derived as shall be agreed
upon.</p>

<p>4. That the military and naval defence of Australia shall be
intrusted to Federal forces under one command.</p>

<p>I submit these resolutions as a groundwork on which a debate may be
raised on the whole question with which we have to deal. They certainly
give a fair expression of the outline of the constitution which we
want, as it exists in my own mind, and to that extent I at once
acknowledge the paternity of the motion I make. I venture to appeal to
every colony, and to every delegate representing every colony, to meet
the work on which we are about to begin, in a broad federal spirit. We
cannot hope for any just conclusion&mdash;we cannot hope reasonably for
any amount of valid success&mdash;unless we lose sight to a large
extent of the local interests which we represent at the same time that
we represent the great cause.</p>

<p>There can be no federation if we should happen, any of us, to insist
upon conditions which stand in the way of federation; there can be no
complete union of these governments, of these communities, of these
separate colonies, unless we can so far clear the way as to approach
the great question of creating a federal power as if the boundaries now
existing had no existence whatever. I cannot too fervently impress upon
my co-representatives from all parts of Australia the necessity of
keeping in view the one object of the better government of Australia,
the whole Australian people.</p>

<p>By my second condition I seek to define what seems to me an
absolutely necessary condition of anything like perfect federation,
that is, that Australia, as Australia, shall be free&mdash;free on the
borders, free everywhere, in its trade and intercourse between its own
people; and that there shall be no impediment of any kind&mdash;that
there shall be no barrier of any kind between one section of the
Australian people and another; but, that the trade and general
communication of these people shall flow on from one end of the
continent to the other, with no one to stay its progress or to call it
to account; in other words, if this is carried, it must necessarily
take with it the shifting of the power of legislation on all fiscal
questions from the local or provincial parliaments, to the great
National Parliament sought to be created. Now our country is fashioned
by nature in a remarkable manner&mdash;in a manner which distinguishes
it from all other countries in the world for unification for family
life&mdash;if I may use that term in a national sense. We are separated
from the rest of the world by many leagues of sea&mdash;from all the
old countries of the world and from the greatest of the new countries;
but we are separated from all countries by a wide expanse of sea, which
leaves us with an immense territory, a fruitful territory, a territory
capable of sustaining its countless millions&mdash;leaves us compact
within ourselves; so that if a perfectly free people can arise
anywhere, it surely may arise in this favoured land of Australia.</p>

<p>Whatever our views may be on other points, I think we shall all be
agreed upon this; that for the defence of Australia to be economical,
to be efficient, to be equal to any emergency that may arise at any
time, it must be of a federal character, and must be under one command.
I do not mean that the naval and land forces shall be under one
commander-in-chief, but that they should be under one kindred
command&mdash;that the naval officer in command equally with the
military officer shall be a federal officer, and amenable to the
national government of Australia.</p>

<p>As to the wisdom of the great step we have now taken, for so many
eminent men from different parts of Australia meeting in this Chamber
as delegates from their colonies is in itself a great step&mdash;as to
the wisdom of that step we have the warning of every country in the
world which has used government by a confederation.</p>

<p>Here we find a people I suppose about 4,000,000 strong. They have
afforded in the great cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane
and Hobart abundant proof of their power of founding an empire. Go
beyond the cities; they have accomplished under responsible government
what appear to me, and what must appear to any stranger who knew the
country thirty-five years ago, marvels in the way of internal
improvements. Not only the railways, but the telegraphs, and everything
that conduces to the best ends of a civilized community, has been
achieved by this scattered people in a marvellous manner. But all
through this great, this noble, this successful effort, we have had
different sources of irritation, of bad neighbourhood, of turmoil, of
aggression, which, if they were to go on, must make these co-terminous
communities instead of being one people of one blood, one faith, one
jurisprudence, one in the very principles of civilization
themselves&mdash;instead of that must make us cavilling, disputatious,
foreign countries. The only way to stop that is for the whole
people&mdash;and remember that the whole people in the final result
must be the arbiters&mdash;to join in creating one great union
government which shall act for the whole. That government must, of
course, be sufficiently strong to act with effect, to act successfully,
and it must be sufficiently strong to carry the name and the fame of
Australia with unspotted beauty, and with uncrippled power throughout
the world. One great end, to my mind, of a federated Australia is, that
it must of necessity secure for Australia a place in the family of
nations, which it never can attain while it is split up into separate
colonies with antagonistic laws and with hardly anything in common.</p>

<p>I regret to say, Mr. President, that my strength is not such as will
enable me to keep on my feet many minutes longer. I have submitted
these resolutions&mdash;perhaps it is all the better&mdash;without any
great effort in their support. I trust I have indicated with a
clearness sufficient what the great object we aim at must be, and the
means by which alone we can hope to accomplish it. I do not doubt that
the gentlemen present will each of them address themselves to the
subject, which, I think, the resolutions have the merit of fairly
launching, in a spirit of patriotism, always keeping in view the
welfare, the prosperity, the united strength, and the ultimate glory of
our common country.</p>

<p><i>March 13th.</i> I am aware that outside these walls, at any rate,
there is a feeling that we ought to wait; that the time has not yet
come. I can only repeat what I have said in other places. If we miss
this particular opportunity, every year that rolls over us will make
the difficulties greater; these difficulties which our separate
existence have imposed will go on increasing. They can only have one
crop of fruit; they can only produce antipathy, disunion, aggression,
reprisal, wide-spread discontent, and, if they are suffered to go on,
civil war. That is a prospect which no man of just mind can
contemplate&mdash;that these colonies, sprung from the same stock,
possessing the same great inheritance of equal laws and all the riches
of science which have been achieved and stored up for us in the mother
country&mdash;that we, side by side, instead of living in brotherhood
and amity, should live in constant irritation and hostility. Either we
must join hands, or we must hold out our hands in defiance of each
other. In the very nature of things we cannot be divided and be one. In
the very nature of things we cannot submit to causes of irritation,
causes of infliction, causes of dissatisfaction, causes of
exasperation, and still live in brotherhood. It is only by joining
hands in good faith as the people of one kindred; it is only by giving
and taking&mdash;by entertaining compromise as far as compromise can be
entertained without deadly injury to principle&mdash;it is only by
doing that, we can hope to found this union. If we unfortunately miss
this great occasion, and leave the work undone, it will be done in a
few years hence, and it will be done by younger hands, who will gain
the credit of having effected this bond of union, which will be in
itself, if rightly effected, of more value than any other achievement
in the history of this continent.</p>

<p>This is no time for glowing periods; it is no time for rhetorical
flights; but it is a time for hard and steady work in trying to do what
we are called here to do, and I would ask the honourable members to do
their utmost by a calm self-suppression, by a close attention to the
object which has brought us here, by mutual respect, mutual
forbearance, and disposition to compromise where compromise is
possible, to assist each other in bringing about this great work; and I
would say that if we do seize the occasion and succeed in doing the
work, we shall have, not now so vividly as hereafter, the blessing of
this and succeeding generations in what we have accomplished.</p>

"THE_COMMONWEALTH_OF_AUSTRALIA"></a>THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;The Melbourne Argus, 10 May 1901</p>

<p align="center">OPENING OF THE FIRST PARLIAMENT</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ten years after the great conference of 1891, the work of Sir Henry
Parkes and his fellow federationists reached its culmination. The first
truly Australian Parliament was opened by the Duke of Cornwall and York
(King George V).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the hand of royalty, in the presence of the greatest concourse of
people that Australia has seen in one building, and with splendid pomp
and ceremonial, the legislative machinery of the Commonwealth was
yesterday set in motion. The day was full of smiles and tears, the
smiles predominating. Rising gloomily, the dispersing clouds allowed
the bright sun to peep through, and when the great ceremony was in
progress in the Exhibition-building, the atmosphere was radiant, and
illuminated the vast spaces of the building and the great sea of faces
with a bright Australian glow.</p>

<p>A sight never to be forgotten was the assemblage which, in perfect
order, but with exalted feeling, awaited the arrival of the Duke and
Duchess in the great avenues which branch out from beneath the vast
Dome of the Exhibition-building. We have not in Australia any sense of
the historical prestige which attaches itself to a royal opening of the
British Parliament. There the stately function is magnificent in its
setting and pregnant in its associations, but it is in scarcely any
sense of the word a people's function.</p>

<p>Here, by a happy inspiration, the function was made, to the fullest
extent, a popular one. Twelve thousand seated in a vast
amphitheatre&mdash;free people, hopeful people, courageous
people&mdash;entrusted with the working out of their own destiny, and
rejoicing in their liberty, must be impressive by reason of their
numbers alone.</p>

<p>But there was not wanting splendour of accessories. The mighty
arches of the dome, the spread of the great transepts, the grace of the
decorations, were in themselves inspiring; nor was even the sombre
shade of the mourning dressing, softened by splashes of purple here and
there, out of keeping with the event, typifying, as it did, our
reverential regard for the memory of a great Constitutional Ruler, the
mightiest Sovereign of the people the world has known.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, what was represented in the noble assemblage was
worth. The worthiest of Australia were there&mdash;the men who hold
their distinguished positions because they have won them, and because
they deserve them. All that is best in politics, in commerce, in
industry, in the arts, in the Church, in the school, in the public
service of Australia was represented there, and every heart beat high
with pride and with hope.</p>

<p>Faint and far off, just about noon there came the sound of the
National Anthem, and there was a multitudinous murmur and stir, for
here was the actual event coming at last. Then near at hand came the
blare of a trumpet heralding the approach of the Imperial envoys, and a
moment or two after, with royal punctuality, the Duke and Duchess were
on the dais, and the strains of the National Anthem came pealing
through the building.</p>

<p>The religious feelings of the occasion were stirred by the singing
of the grand "Old Hundredth" to the words of the metrical psalm,
commencing "All people that on earth do dwell." This was taken up by
thousands of the audience, and its swelling harmonies rose grandly to
the dome. Lord Hopetoun, setting aside all complicated questions of
religious precedence, himself read several prayers, in his clear,
penetrating voice, so pleasantly familiar in Victoria.</p>

<p>When the Duke stepped forward to deliver his speech to the two
Houses, a "Hush" ran round the assembly, and everyone listened
intently, but the sound of the ever-moving feet on the boarded floors
went on. His Royal Highness spoke deliberately, in a clear, strong
voice, and the speech he read was distinctly heard by thousands of
those present. It was a dignified, a graceful, a kindly, and a
congratulatory speech, and it expressed a confident belief that the new
powers granted to Australia will only strengthen the affection of the
people for the throne and empire.</p>

<p>At the final words, "I now declare the Parliament of the
Commonwealth of Australia open," the Duchess touched an electric button
which gave the signal outside for the hoisting of the Union Jack on all
the State schools of the Colony, and for the sending of a message to
England declaring the object of the journey of the Royal envoys
accomplished. Trumpets rang out the signal, and outside was heard the
booming of cannon in royal salute.</p>

<p>After a brief pause the Duke of Cornwall and York stepped forward
once more and read a special cable message of congratulation from His
Majesty the King. And now Australia asserted herself. She had been
suppressing her feelings to show that she knew how to behave with
old-world decorum in the presence of Royalty, but this message, direct
from the King himself, was too much&mdash;they simply had to cheer. And
cheer they did. It was done without order or without concert. It was
taken up time after time by sections of the audience; it ran round the
aisles, and surged through the galleries; a hearty, spontaneous,
irrepressible Australian cheer. It was not down in the programme, but
it formed a most effective part of it.</p>

<p>The final part of the ceremony, which altogether occupied about
three-quarters of an hour, was the swearing-in of members by the
Governor-General. He stood on the dais and read out the oath, whilst
the members, Bible in hand, followed him in sections. Then Lord
Hopetoun stepped to the front of the dais, and directing the audience
by the waving of his hat, called for three cheers for His Royal
Highness the Duke, which were given with splendid heartiness, and
followed by another round for the Duchess, after which the Duke and
Duchess retired and the great ceremony was over.</p>

<p align="center">TELEGRAM FROM THE KING</p>

<p>His Royal Highness read the following telegram from His Majesty the
King:</p>

<p>"My thoughts are with you on the day of the important ceremony. Most
fervently do I wish Australia prosperity and great happiness."</p>

<p align="center">REPLY TO THE KING</p>

<p>The following telegram was despatched by His Royal Highness the Duke
of Cornwall and York to His Majesty the King immediately after the
opening ceremony:</p>

<p>"I have just delivered your message, and, in your name, declared
open the first Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. I also read
your kind telegram of good wishes, which is deeply appreciated by your
loving Australian subjects, and was received with great enthusiasm.
Splendid and impressive ceremony, over 12,000 people in
Exhibition-building."</p>

<p align="center">MESSAGE FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>When the newly-elected President of the Federal Senate and Speaker
of the House of Representatives were presented to His Excellency the
Governor-General at the Old Treasury buildings yesterday afternoon,
Lord Hopetoun intimated to them and to the members of the Commonwealth
Legislature who were present that he had received the subjoined message
from the Secretary of State for the Colonies:</p>

<p>"His Majesty's Government welcomes the new Parliament that to-day
takes its place among the great legislative bodies of the British
Empire and they feel confident that it will be a faithful interpreter
of the aspirations of a free and loyal people, and they trust that its
deliberations will promote the happiness, prosperity, and unity of the
whole continent of Australia."</p>

<p>The message was subsequently read in both Houses of the Federal
Parliament, and received with cheers.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOER_WAR" id="THE_BOER_WAR"></a>THE BOER WAR</h2>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;The Times History of the War in South Africa,
1899-1902, Vol. III, pp. 30-31, 34-35; Vol. IV, p. 428</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The clash of interests in South Africa between settlers of Dutch and
of British origin gave rise to much ill-feeling, and in 1899 Great
Britain decided to annex the South African Colonies in order to protect
the interests of her subjects. In the ensuing struggle the Colonies
freely offered support, both moral and physical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of all the colonies the Australian ones were the most directly
interested in the South African controversy. In view of the vast and
increasing trade between Australia and the mother-country, the safety
of the Cape route must always be a question of the very highest
importance in the eyes of Australian statesmen. And apart from such
considerations of contingent self-interest, Australians had strong
personal feelings over the issue between Kruger and the Uitlanders.
Australian miners formed no small section of the population of the
Rand. Australians were under no illusions as to the idyllic character
of the peasant-owners of the Transvaal. As soon as the crisis became
acute, public meetings were held all over the Australian colonies to
express sympathy with the Uitlanders and to support the attitude of the
Imperial Government. The question of sending Australian contingents to
join the Imperial forces in the event of a war was discussed at an
early stage. The idea of active participation in the wars of the Empire
was not altogether a new one. As far back as 1867 Tasmania had sent a
contingent to assist the Imperial forces in the Maori war. More
recently a body of New South Wales troops took part in the Sudan
campaign of 1885. A little active service and much tedious waiting at
Suakim was all they saw, and one might have imagined that in Australia
the result had been to damp any inclination to repeat the performance.
But the partial disappointment of 1885 made the Australians all the
more eager to try again.</p>

<p>Between October 28 and November 5 the first Australian contingents
sailed amidst the most enthusiastic popular demonstrations. They were
officered and manned almost entirely by members of the various colonial
volunteer forces, and thus possessed the advantage of a certain amount
of initial training which was destined to stand them in good stead in
the field. It should never be forgotten that their success was mainly
due to the persistent effort of those officers, whether Imperial or
colonial, who during the past twenty years had given their services to
the development and organization of the colonial forces. It was the
existence of these forces that kept up the military spirit in the
colonies.</p>

<p>Small as was the force contributed by the Empire (nearly 80,000 men)
it was none the less a material assistance, whose value can hardly be
overrated. It practically doubled the mounted force, and thus made
possible those sweeping movements by which Lord Roberts reached
Pretoria. Above all, it gave the Imperial Government a moral support
which enabled it to face with equanimity the almost universal hostility
of the European powers or the fanatical outcries of a few
anti-Imperialist partisans at home. Never, probably, in modern times
has there been a greater consensus of honest opinion in support of a
great national movement than that which backed up Britain's effort to
maintain her position in South Africa. It was simply that the free
citizens of free countries asked to be allowed to venture their lives
for the sake of a political ideal which was personally and intimately
dear to each one of them, and that, in spite of the paralysing absence
of either precedent or preparation, many thousands actually achieved
their desire. The war has not shown what the Empire can do, but it has
revealed to those who perhaps doubted before, what an Empire we can
make if we but choose.</p>

<p align="center">ELANDS RIVER</p>

<p>Amongst varying fortunes and many indecisive actions, the defence of
the position at Elands River stands out as an achievement only made
possible by courage and grim determination.</p>

<p>For several weeks Colonel Hore, with a small garrison at Brakfontein
on the Elands River, had been keeping up the connection between
Mafeking and Zeerust, policing the district and forwarding on convoys
to Rustenburg. At the beginning of August the force which he had for
this purpose, as well as to guard a large store of supplies, consisted
of 500 men, nearly all Imperial bushmen or Rhodesians, an old
muzzle-loading seven-pounder, and two maxims. By this time Lord Roberts
had determined that several isolated posts in the Western Transvaal,
such as this one, which were in constant danger of attack, must be
evacuated, and on August 1 ordered General Carrington to march to
Elands River to cover Hore's retirement. But De la Rey, with three
detachments of his troops under himself, Lemmer, and Steenekemp, each
numbering about 300 men, and each with a gun and a pom-pom, and a
maxim, had arrived there before him, and on the morning of August 4 had
aroused Hore's camp by shell and rifle fire from the north-west, east,
and south-east. The camp was on a small boulder-strewn kopje, in the
centre of an amphitheatre about five acres in extent, and half a mile
east of the river. Most of the men were on this central kopje, but two
small hills on the bank of the river were held by detachments under
Captain Butters and Lieutenant Zouch. Luckily, an attack had been
expected, and stone sangars and shelters of ox-wagons had been made and
further protected by biscuit boxes and bags of flour and sugar from the
stores the men were guarding. Nevertheless the Boer attack seemed to
have every chance in its favour; their guns were in safe positions
2,400 yards from the camp, and along the river banks they could creep
close up to the defenders. Hore's old seven-pounder, though it
succeeded in silencing a Boer gun, and killed a German gunner, was very
capricious in its working, and was obviously no match for the Boer
guns. The thousands of horses and oxen which were in the camp under no
sort of cover were nearly all killed on the first day by the Boer
shells; and the stench arising from these dead animals in the narrow
camp makes it almost marvellous that the men who escaped the Boer
shells were not killed by pestilence. Moreover, the only chance of
getting water was to take the water carts down to the river at night,
and then the drivers and escort were not always safe. To make matters
worse, on the second day of the siege Carrington's advance scouts,
after appearing on the rise to the west, were soon seen retiring again,
so that rescue from this side seemed now out of the question. When
starting, Carrington did not know that Hore was invested, so he carried
very few rations. He no doubt had a small force with him and was badly
off for supplies; but he had gained a ridge from which he commanded the
way to Elands River, and under the circumstances of Hore's pressing
danger he was too quickly discouraged from a more determined effort to
bring out the garrison. From the east another attempt was made to
relieve Hore which proved equally abortive.</p>

<p>On August 5 firing had been heard in the direction of Elands River,
so next day Baden-Powell marched with his own and Mahon's mounted
troops about half-way to Brakfontein. Here he heard guns firing in a
westerly direction, but as the sound seemed to grow fainter and
fainter, he assumed, without, however, waiting for the reports of his
scouts, that Carrington had succeeded in withdrawing Hore towards
Mafeking.</p>

<p>After Carrington's retreat to Zeerust on August 5 and Baden-Powell's
to Rustenburg on the 6th, Lord Roberts had given up all hope of saving
this garrison. But on the 13th a runner from Colonel Hore had arrived
at Crocodile Pools, announcing that he had not surrendered. On hearing
this the Field Marshal ordered Kitchener to take part of his force to
relieve him. Kitchener started on the 16th. from Quaggafontein with
Little's, Broadwood's, and Smith-Dorrien's brigades. After Carrington
had come up and gone away again on August 5, the garrison, though
apparently left to their fate, would hear nothing of surrender, but
made up their minds to fight as long as they had ammunition and
strength to use it. Luckily they were well provided with food, and the
Boers, as usual in their sieges, were content to sit round and fire at
them without seriously attempting to rush the place as they should have
done. The garrison also kept up their spirits by sudden raids at night
on adventurous Boers or guns that came too near. Thus, as at Wepener,
it became a game of patience for the garrison, dissimilar only in this,
that at Elands River there was no promise of support to buoy up the
garrison with hope.</p>

<p>However, on August 16, after eleven days' siege, De la Rey moved
away on the news of the approaching relief columns, and Lord Kitchener
rode in to set free the garrison.</p>

<p>This siege, like that of Wepener, was especially a Colonial triumph;
there the garrison had been chiefly Cape Colonials, here the majority
were Australians of Carrington's first Brigade, the rest being
Rhodesians, and it would be difficult to praise overmuch the
determination and fine spirit shown by these Colonials in their first
opportunity of distinguishing themselves as a corps. Every soldier who
saw the place afterwards expressed surprise that they could have held
out so long, and it is therefore the more creditable to them to have
done so when every hope of relief seemed entirely cut off; while, at a
time when surrenders and retreats were not sufficiently rare, the
example shown by these splendid men was even more important than the
position they held.</p>

<p>The aggressive policy of Germany led to the outbreak in 1914 of the

respect Belgian neutrality was but a "Scrap of Paper." Great Britain,
as one of the signatories to the treaty, protested against such a
violation of good faith, but finding protestation vain declared war
upon Germany on 4 August 1914.</p>

<p>The whole Empire solidly supported the Mother Country and shared

<p align="center">THE RALLY OF THE EMPIRE</p>

<p>Important as were the offers of help, both of men and provisions,
which the self-governing Dominions and the Indian Empire made to the
Mother Country almost immediately after the outbreak of the war, the
knowledge that these great daughter-nations were morally convinced of
the justice of the British cause, was a factor of even more
far-reaching importance. Great as was the necessity of organizing and
expanding the Imperial forces, and thus creating an extra army or
armies to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force in France, urgent
as was the need of taking advantage of the prompt offers of help which
came from all parts of the Empire, the necessity of convincing the
self-governing Dominions and the Empire at large of the righteousness
of the cause for which Great Britain was fighting was more imperative
still. For in the long run the consciousness of the justice of the
principles for which a people is fighting, alone can ensure the massing
of material force sufficient to secure material victory.</p>

<p>Evidence that the case for Great Britain was fully understood and
thoroughly approved, not only by our own peoples, but by the bulk of
the neutral States of the world, was not long in presenting itself. The
Dominions as a whole had satisfied themselves that the British cause
was just, before Sir Edward Grey had made it plain by his speech of
August 3rd that the British Government had done everything short of
sacrificing the honour of the country to avoid war. In the words of Sir
Richard McBride, the Premier of British Columbia, "Should it
unfortunately develop that Great Britain is compelled to engage in
hostilities, Canada will automatically be at war also"; while in
Australia, Mr. Fisher, the ex-Prime Minister, declared, "Should honour
demand the Mother Country to take part in hostilities, Australians will
stand beside her to the last man and the last shilling." These
sentiments found expression in the offers of help of men and material,
which have been described in the preceding chapter. To those offers the
King replied by a message to the Overseas Dominions:</p>

<p>"I desire to express to my people of the Overseas Dominions with
what appreciation and pride I have received the messages from their
respective Governments during the last few days.</p>

<p>"These spontaneous assurances of their fullest support recall to me
the generous, self-sacrificing help given by them in the past to the
Mother Country.</p>

<p>"I shall be strengthened in the discharge of the great
responsibility which rests upon me by the confident belief that in this
time of trial my Empire will stand united, calm, resolute, trusting in
God.</p>

<p align="center">THE SINKING OF THE <i>EMDEN</i> (German cruiser)</p>

<p>Against us there were known to be some eight or nine German cruisers
abroad, all efficient for commerce-destroying purposes, and several
with very high speed, which it was recognized would require a great
deal of catching....</p>

<p>The <i>Emden</i> was a small vessel of some 3,500 tons, with a speed
of about 25 knots&mdash;quite fast enough to overhaul any British
steamer she was likely to encounter, and fast enough also to run away,
if necessary. The <i>Emden</i> was generally heard of where she was
least expected, and after reaping her harvest of merchantmen, as
unaccountably disappeared. In something under six weeks she had
captured nearly twenty steamers, always contriving to pick up a collier
among them, so that she was able to keep her bunkers
replenished....</p>

<p>As a variety of adventure, the <i>Emden</i> steamed one evening into
Madras Roads, and threw shell into the outskirts of the town for the
space of half an hour or so&mdash;some oil tanks were set ablaze, and
two or three natives killed; Fort George returned the
fire&mdash;probably without effect&mdash;and the <i>Emden</i>
retired.</p>

<p>It may be assumed that the German captain received information by
wireless of the probable approach of colliers or other vessels, as he
was so very much on the spot; in any case, he was a courageous and
enterprising man, and a good sportsman; but we wanted very badly to
catch him. There are so many holes and corners in that part of the
world, where a vessel may lie for a time with little chance of
detection, and the <i>Emden's</i> speed would have enabled her to reach
some such refuge very quickly.</p>

<p>The last act in the drama of the <i>Emden</i> took place off the
Cocos-Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean....</p>

<p>It was to this desolate spot in the Indian Ocean that Captain Von
Muller brought his ship, in the early days of November; with him was
one of his captures, the <i>Buresk</i>, which was full of coal. The
object of this visit of the <i>Emden</i> was the destruction of the
important wireless station that is established on the islands, and on
the morning of November 9th, the officials were unpleasantly surprised
by the landing of an armed boat's crew from a cruiser, which had come
to an anchor, and which they first imagined to be H.M.S.
<i>Minotaur</i>. They were quickly undeceived by the German officer in
charge of the party, who informed them that their operations from the
wireless station had greatly hampered the movements of the cruiser. One
detachment of the Germans then rounded up all the officials and their
servants, placing them under a strict guard, while a second party
prepared to blow up the wireless installation and to smash the
instrument rooms of the cable office. This they did most thoroughly,
but the officials seem to have kept their heads in the most
praiseworthy manner, as, just as soon as they discovered that the enemy
was upon them, they sent out distress signals by wireless, and warned
adjacent stations by cable that they were about to be smashed up.</p>

<p>The landing party now blew up the wireless mast and the store in
which spare cable and cable gear was kept; a third explosion wrecked
the wireless hut, and completed the destruction of the installation.
The dynamo rooms and workshops were destroyed with flogging hammers and
axes, everything breakable, including clocks, being smashed to atoms.
Their next proceeding was to cut the shore ends of the submarine
cables, and this was done in full view of the prisoners. There are
three cables from the Cocos&mdash;to Perth, to Batavia, and to
Rodriguez&mdash;and the pleasure of the prisoners can be imagined when
they saw the Germans spend much hard labour in destroying a dummy
cable. Eventually the Perth cable and the dummy were cut, the others
being left, presumably because the Germans did not know that they
existed.</p>

<p>The party from the <i>Emden</i> had landed at 7.30 a.m., and by 9.20
their mission of destruction was accomplished. At this time a signal
was blown on the siren from the ship; the officer in command collected
his men, marched them down to the beach, and re-embarked. The
telegraphists report that they were fairly and courteously treated. On
arrival the <i>Emden</i> was still using her now famous fourth funnel,
a dummy, and this it was that caused the telegraphists to mistake her
in the first instance for the <i>Minotaur</i>, which is a
four-funnelled armoured cruiser. As she steamed away in the bright
light of the tropic morning for what was so shortly to prove her last
cruise, the <i>Emden</i> hauled down, and stowed away, her dummy.</p>

<p>The action that ensued between the <i>Sydney</i> and the
<i>Emden</i> is here given in the official despatch of Captain Glossop,
dated from Colombo on November 15th:</p>

<p>I have the honour to report that whilst on escort duty with the
convoy under the charge of Captain Silver, H.M.A.S. <i>Melbourne</i>,
at 6.30 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 9th, a wireless message from Cocos was
heard reporting that a foreign warship was off the entrance. I was
ordered to raise steam for full speed at 7.0 a.m. and proceeded
thither. I worked up to twenty knots, and at 9.15 a.m. sighted land
ahead and almost immediately the smoke of a ship, which proved to be
the H.I.G.M.S. <i>Emden</i> coming out towards me at a great rate. At
9.40 a.m. fire was opened, she firing the first shot. I kept my
distance as much as possible to obtain the advantage of my guns. Her
fire was very accurate and rapid to begin with, but seemed to slacken
very quickly, all casualties occurring in this ship almost immediately.
First, the foremost funnel of her went, secondly the foremast, and she
was badly on fire aft, then the second funnel went, and lastly the
third funnel, and I saw she was making for the beach on North Keeling
Island, where she grounded at 11.20 a.m. I gave her two more broadsides
and left her, to pursue a merchant ship which had come up during the
action.</p>

<p>2. Although I had guns on this merchant ship at odd times during the
action, I had not fired, and as she was making off fast, I pursued and
overtook her at 12.10, firing a gun across her bows and hoisting
International Code Signal to stop, which she did. I sent an armed boat,
and found her to be the ss. <i>Buresk</i>, a captured British collier,
with 18 Chinese crew, 1 English steward, 1 Norwegian cook, and a German
prize crew of 3 officers, 1 warrant officer, and 12 men. The ship
unfortunately was sinking, so I took all on board, fired four shells
into her, and returned to <i>Emden</i>, passing men swimming in the
water, for whom I left two boats I was towing from <i>Buresk</i>.</p>

<p>3. On arriving again off <i>Emden</i>, she still had her colours up
at mainmast head. I inquired by signal, International Code, "Will you
surrender?" and received a reply in Morse, "What signal? No signal
books." I then made in Morse, "Do you surrender?" and subsequently,
"Have you received my signal?" to neither of which did I get an answer.
The German officers on board gave me to understand that the captain
would never surrender, and therefore, though very reluctantly, I again
fired at her at 4.30 p.m., ceasing at 4.35, as she showed white flags
and hauled down her ensign by sending a man aloft.</p>

<p>4. I then left Emden and returned and picked up the <i>Buresk's</i>
two boats, rescuing two sailors (5.0 p.m.) who had been in the water
all day. I returned and sent in one boat to <i>Emden</i>, manned by her
own prize crew from <i>Buresk</i> and one officer, and stating I would
return to their assistance next morning.</p>

<p>5. I lay on and off all night, and communicated with Direction
Island at 8.0 a.m., November 10th, to find that the <i>Emden's</i>
party, consisting of three officers and forty men, one launch and two
cutters, had seized and provisioned a 70-ton schooner (the
<i>Ayesha</i>), having four Maxims with two belts to each. They left
the previous night at six o'clock. The wireless station was entirely
destroyed, one cable cut, one damaged, and one intact. I borrowed a
doctor and two assistants, and proceeded as fast as possible to
<i>Emden's</i> assistance.</p>

<p>6. I sent an officer on board to see the captain, and in view of the
large number of prisoners and wounded, and lack of accommodation, etc.,
in this ship, and the absolute impossibility of leaving them there, he
agreed that if I received his officers and men and all wounded, "then
as for such time as they remained in <i>Sydney</i> they would cause no
interference with ship or fittings, and would be amenable to the ship's
discipline." I therefore set to work at once to tranship them&mdash;a
most difficult operation, the ship being on weather side of island, and
the send alongside very heavy. The conditions in the <i>Emden</i> were
indescribable. I received the last from her at 5.0 p.m., then had to go
round to the lee side to pick up 20 more men who had managed to get
ashore from the ship.</p>

<p>7. Darkness came on before this could be accomplished, and the ship
again stood off and on all night, resuming operations at 5.0 a.m., on
November 11th, a cutter's crew having to land with stretchers to bring
wounded round to embarking point. A German officer, a doctor, died
ashore the previous day. The ship in the meantime ran over to Direction
Island to return their doctor and assistants, send cables, and was back
again at 10 a.m., embarked the remainder of wounded, and proceeded for
Colombo by 10.35 a.m., Wednesday, November 11th.</p>

<p>8. Total casualties in <i>Sydney</i>: killed, 3; severely wounded
(since dead), 1; severely wounded, 4; wounded, 4; slightly wounded, 4.
In the <i>Emden</i> I can only approximately state the killed at 7
officers and 108 men from captain's statement. I had on board 11
officers, 9 warrant officers and 191 men, of whom 3 officers and 53 men
were wounded, and of this number 1 officer and 3 men have since died of
wounds.</p>

<p>9. The damage to Sydney's hull and fittings was surprisingly small;
in all about ten hits seem to have been made. The engine and boiler
rooms and funnels escaped entirely.</p>

<p>10. I have great pleasure in stating that the behaviour of the
ship's company was excellent in every way, and with such a large number
of young hands and people under training it is all the more
gratifying.</p>

<p>It will be seen from Captain Glossop's despatch that he was on
escort duty with the convoy under the charge of Captain Silver of
H.M.A.S. <i>Melbourne</i>. This convoy was carrying Australian and New
Zealand troops to the scene of the great conflict in Europe. The act of
self-denial on the part of Captain Silver in sending the <i>Sydney</i>
to engage the <i>Emden</i>, instead of taking that duty upon himself,
certainly deserves to be noted. This officer denied to himself and to
the officers and men under his command, the privilege of dealing with
the notorious raider, and in so doing he was actuated solely by his
high sense of duty and the responsibility that he owed to his country.
In his judgment the <i>Sydney</i> was the more suitable ship, so she
was sent, and the <i>Melbourne</i> remained with her convoy until the
affair was concluded.</p>

<p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;Dispatch from a special Correspondent at the
Dardanelles printed in The Times, 7 May 1915</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon after the commencement of the war Turkey joined the Central
Powers, and consequently the Australian Imperial Forces, having
experienced a rigorous training in Egypt, were used to assist the Navy
and other Allied troops in an attempt to force the Dardanelles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">VIEWED FROM A BATTLESHIP</p>

<p>Slowly through the night of April 24th our squadron, which was to
land the covering forces of the Australian contingent just north of
Gaba Tepe, steamed towards its destination....</p>

<p>At 1 a.m. the ships arrived off their appointed rendezvous, five
miles from the landing-place, and stopped. The soldiers were aroused
from their slumbers, and were served with a last hot meal. A visit to
the mess decks showed these Australians, the majority of whom were
about to go into action for the first time under the most trying
circumstances, possessed at 1 o'clock in the morning courage to be
cheerful, quiet, and confident....</p>

<p>At 1.20 a.m. the signal was given from the flagship to lower the
boats, which had been left swinging from the davits throughout the
night. Our steam pinnaces were also lowered to take them in tow....</p>

<p>On the quarter-deck, backed by the great 12 in. guns, this splendid
body of colonial troops were drawn up in serried ranks, fully equipped,
and receiving their last instructions from their officers, who, six
months ago, like their men, were leading a peaceful civilian life in
Australia and New Zealand, 5,000 miles away....</p>

<p>At 2.5 a.m. the signal was given for the troops to embark in the
boats which were lying alongside, and this was carried out with great
rapidity, in absolute silence, and without a hitch or an accident of
any kind....</p>

<p>The whole operation had been timed to allow the pinnaces and boats
to reach the beach just before daylight, so that the Turks, if they had
been forewarned, would not be able to see to fire before the
Australians had obtained a firm footing and, it was hoped, good cover
on the foreshore....</p>

<p>At 4.53 a.m. there suddenly came a very sharp burst of rifle fire
from the beach, and we knew our men were at last at grips with the
enemy. This fire lasted only for a few minutes, and then was drowned by
a faint British cheer wafted to us over the waters....</p>

<p>The first authentic news we received came with the return of our
boats. A steam pinnace came alongside with two recumbent forms on her
deck and a small figure, pale, but cheerful, and waving his hand
astern. They were one of our midshipmen, just sixteen years of age,
shot through the stomach, but regarding his injury more as a fitting
consummation to a glorious holiday ashore than a wound; and a chief
stoker, and petty officer, all three wounded by that first burst of
musketry, which caused many casualties in the boats just as they
reached the beach.</p>

<p>From them we learned what had happened in those first wild moments.
All the tows had almost reached the beach, when a party of Turks,
entrenched almost on the shore, opened up a terrible fusillade from
rifles and also from a Maxim. Fortunately most of the bullets went
high, but, nevertheless, many men were hit as they sat huddled together
forty or fifty in a boat.</p>

<p>It was a trying moment, but the Australian volunteers rose as a man
to the occasion. They waited neither for orders, nor for the boats to
reach the beach, but, springing out into the sea, they waded ashore,
and, forming some sort of a rough line, rushed straight on the flashes
of the enemy's rifles. Their magazines were not charged, so they just
went in with cold steel, and I believe I am right in saying that the
first Ottoman Turk since the last Crusade received an Anglo-Saxon
bayonet in him at 5 minutes after 5 a.m. on April 25th. It was over in
a minute. The Turks in this first trench were bayoneted or ran away,
and a Maxim gun was captured.</p>

<p>Then the Australians found themselves facing an almost perpendicular
cliff of loose sandstone, covered with thick shrubbery, and somewhere
half-way up the enemy had a second trench strongly held, from which
they poured a terrible fire on the troops below, and the boats pulling
back to the destroyers for the second landing party.</p>

<p>Here was a tough proposition to tackle in the darkness, but these
Colonials are practical above all else, and they went about it in a
practical way. They stopped a few moments to pull themselves together,
and to get rid of their packs which no troops could carry in an attack,
and then charged their magazines. Then this race of athletes proceeded
to scale the cliffs without responding to the enemy's fire. They lost
some men but did not worry, and in less than a quarter of an hour the
Turks were out of their second position, either bayoneted or in full
flight.</p>

<p>This ridge under which the landing was made, stretches due north
from Gaba Tepe, and culminates in the height of Coja Chemen, which
rises 950 feet above the sea level. The whole forms part of a confused
triangle of hills, valleys, ridges, and bluffs which stretches right
across the Gallipoli Peninsula to the Bay of Bassi Liman, above the
Narrows. The triangle is cut in two by the valley through which flows
the stream known as Bokali Deresi....</p>

<p>In the early part of the day very heavy casualties were suffered in
the boats which conveyed the troops from the destroyers, tugs, and
transports to the beach. As soon as it became light, the enemy's
sharpshooters, hidden everywhere, simply concentrated their fire on the
boats....</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of April 25th the landing of troops, stores,
and munitions had to be carried out under these conditions, but the
gallant sailors never failed their equally gallant comrades ashore.
Every one, from the youngest midshipman straight from Dartmouth and
under fire for the first time, to the senior officers in charge, did
their duty nobly....</p>

<p>When the sun was fully risen and the haze had disappeared, we could
see that the Australians had actually established themselves on the top
of the ridge, and were evidently trying to work their way northwards
along it....</p>

<p>The fighting was so confused, and took place amongst such broken
ground that it is extremely difficult to follow exactly what did happen
throughout the morning and afternoon of April the 25th. The role
assigned to the covering force was splendidly carried out up to a
certain point, and a firm footing was obtained on the crest of the
ridge which allowed the disembarkation of the remainder of the force to
go on uninterruptedly except for the never-ceasing sniping.</p>

<p>But then the Australians, whose blood was up, instead of entrenching
themselves and waiting developments, pushed northward and eastward
inland, in search of fresh enemies to tackle with the bayonet. The
ground is so broken and ill-defined that it was very difficult to
select a position to entrench, especially as after the troops imagined
they had cleared a section, they were continually being sniped from all
sides. Therefore they preferred to continue the advance.... The Turks
only had a comparatively weak force actually holding the beach, and
they seemed to have relied on the difficult nature of the ground, and
their scattered snipers, to delay the advance until they could bring up
reinforcements from the interior.</p>

<p>Some of the Australians who had pushed inland were counter-attacked
and almost outflanked by these oncoming reserves, and had to fall back
after suffering very heavy casualties.</p>

<p>It was then the turn of the Turks to counter-attack, and this they
continued to do throughout the afternoon, but the Australians never
yielded a foot of ground on the main ridge, and reinforcements were
continually poured up from the beach as fresh troops were disembarked
from the transports. The enemy's artillery fire, however, presented a
very difficult problem. As soon as the light became good, the Turks
enfiladed the beach with two field guns from Gaba Tepe, and with two
others from the north.... In vain did the warships endeavour to put
them out of action with their secondary armament. For some hours they
could not be accurately located, or else were so well protected that
our shells failed to do them any harm....</p>

<p>Later in the day the two guns to the north were silenced ... and a
cruiser moving in close to the shore, so plastered Gaba Tepe with a
hail of shell that the guns there were also silenced and have not
attempted to reply since.</p>

<p>As the enemy brought up reinforcements, towards dusk his attacks
became more and more vigorous, and he was supported by a powerful
artillery inland, which the ships' guns were powerless to deal with.
The pressure on the Australians and New Zealanders became heavier, and
the line they were occupying had to be contracted for the night.
General Birdwood and his staff went ashore in the afternoon, and
devoted all their energies to securing the position, so as to hold
firmly to it until the following morning, when it was hoped to get some
field guns in position to deal with the enemy's artillery.</p>

<p>Some idea of the difficulty to be faced may be gathered when it is
remembered that every round of ammunition, all water, and all supplies
had to be landed on a narrow beach and then carried up pathless hills,
valleys, and bluffs, several hundred feet high, to the firing line. The
whole of this mass of troops, concentrated on a very small area, and
unable to reply, were exposed to a relentless and incessant shrapnel
fire, which swept every yard of the ground, although, fortunately, a
great deal of it was badly aimed or burst too high. The reserves were
engaged in road-making and carrying supplies to the crest, and in
answering the calls for more ammunition.</p>

<p>A serious problem was getting away the wounded from the shore, where
it was impossible to keep them. All those who were unable to hobble to
the beach had to be carried down to the hills on stretchers, then
hastily dressed and carried to the boats. The boat and beach parties
never stopped working throughout the entire day and night.</p>

<p>The courage displayed by these wounded Australians will never be
forgotten. Hastily dressed and placed in trawlers, lighters, and ships'
boats they were towed to the ships.... I have, in fact, never seen the
like of those wounded Australians in war before, for as they were towed
amongst the ships, whilst accommodation was being found for them,
although many were shot to bits, and without hope of recovery, their
cheers resounded through the night, and you could just see, amidst a
mass of suffering humanity, arms being waved in greeting to the crews
of the warships. They were happy because they had been tried for the
first time in the war and had not been found wanting. They had been
told to occupy the heights and hold on, and this they had done for
fifteen mortal hours, under an incessant shell fire, without the moral
and material support of a single gun ashore, and subjected the whole
time to the violent counter-attacks of a brave enemy, led by skilled
leaders, whilst his snipers, hidden in caves and thickets and amongst
the dense scrub, made a deliberate practice of picking off every
officer who endeavoured to give a word of command or lead his men
forward.</p>

<p>No finer feat of arms has been performed during the war than this
sudden landing in the dark, the storming of the heights, and above all,
the holding on to the position thus won whilst reinforcements were
being poured from the transports. These raw Colonial troops in those
desperate hours proved themselves worthy to fight side by side with the
heroes of Mons and the Aisne, Ypres, and Neuve Chapelle.</p>

<h2><a name="WHAT_ANZAC_MEANS" id="WHAT_ANZAC_MEANS"></a>WHAT ANZAC
MEANS</h2>

<p align="center">By Senator Pearce (Minister of State for Defence)</p>

<p><b>Source</b>.&mdash;The Melbourne Argus, 25 April 1916</p>

<p>In an army a knowledge of its past achievements is a mighty factor
in its future success. Before this war Australia had practically no
army traditions, and it is to the meaning of the Gallipoli campaign in
this connection that I would direct attention to-day, twelve months
after the historic landing.</p>

<p>To the peoples of Europe the thought of war was ever present in the
popular mind; but to the Australian, born and bred in an atmosphere
untainted by war, living amid peaceful surroundings and desirous of
remaining on terms of friendship with the rest of mankind the word
itself has a jarring sound. Yet the German challenge to the Mother
Country finds 233,720 of her Australian sons who have voluntarily
wrenched themselves from their parents, wives, and friends, and from
comfortable and cheerful homes, to answer the call of their country to
fight the Empire's battles on distant shores.</p>

<p>Nor has the thunder of the cannon been necessary to inspire
Australians with a conception of their duty; and the explanation of it
all is that we have inherited to the full that spirit of our forebears
which enabled them, not so long ago, to tear themselves from homeland
firesides to shape careers in this great island continent, and to
overcome with indomitable pluck the awful hardships of a pioneering
life.</p>

<p>For generations to come the story of the entry of the Australian
troops to the European battlefield will ring in the ears of
English-speaking nations. The chronicler of the future will provide
many thrilling pages of history, magnificent material for the moulding
of the youthful Australian character.</p>

<p>A distinguished military officer told us before the war that
Australians would require to be in the majority of two to one in
meeting a foreign foe on our own shores; but the furious onslaught that
accompanied the landing at Gallipoli, the bitter fighting and terrible
trials of the occupation, and the wonderful skill that made possible
the bloodless evacuation have shown us that the Australians carried out
a feat of arms not excelled by the most highly-trained regulars of any
nation of the world. The following messages are eloquent in their
tribute to Australian bravery:</p>

<p>"I heartily congratulate you upon the splendid conduct and bravery
displayed by the Australian troops in the operations at the
Dardanelles, who have indeed proved themselves worthy sons of the
Empire."&mdash;His Majesty the King, <i>April 1915</i>.</p>

<p>"The capture of the positions we hold will go down to history as a
magnificent feat of the Australians and New Zealanders."&mdash;General
Sir William Birdwood, <i>November 1915</i>.</p>

<p>"Happen what may, the Australians who have fought at Gallipoli will
bequeath a heritage of honour to their children's
children."&mdash;General Sir Ian Hamilton, <i>November 1915</i>.</p>

<p>These are examples of the praise which that feat of arms has won,
and such is the standing of military bearing which the improvised army
of Australian citizens has set up for the citizen army of
Australia&mdash;a standard which, we may rest assured, has not failed
to impress our enemies in computing the military value of our
forces.</p>

<p>Every unit of the citizen army will now have its tradition. Every
soldier of the Australian army will have that inspiring example of the
Anzac heroes to live up to in his military work, and we can regard the
future with a calm confidence in the military prowess of our
soldiers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Allied troops evacuated the Gallipoli Peninsula in December
1915, and the majority of the Australian Imperial Force was then
transferred to the Western Front in France, where on fiercely fought
fields such as Pozi&egrave;res, Messines, Cambrai, Amiens, and others
too numerous to detail here, they won imperishable fame.</p>
