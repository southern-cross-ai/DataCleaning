  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnOldMateOfYourFathers"></a>An Old Mate Of Your Father&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>You remember when we hurried home from the old bush school how we were sometimes
    startled by a bearded apparition, who smiled kindly down on us, and whom
    our mother introduced, as we raked off our hats, as &ldquo;An old mate of
    your father&rsquo;s on the diggings, Johnny.&rdquo; And he would pat our
    heads and say we were fine boys, or girls&mdash;as the case may have been&mdash;and
    that we had our father&rsquo;s nose but our mother&rsquo;s eyes, or the other
    way about; and say that the baby was the dead spit of its mother, and then
    added, for father&rsquo;s benefit: &ldquo;But yet he&rsquo;s like you, Tom.&rdquo; It
    did seem strange to the children to hear him address the old man by his Christian
    name&mdash;considering that the mother always referred to him as &ldquo;Father.&rdquo; She
    called the old mate Mr So-and-so, and father called him Bill, or something
    to that effect.</p>
  <p>Occasionally the old mate would come dressed in the latest city fashion,
    and at other times in a new suit of reach-me-downs, and yet again he would
    turn up in clean white moleskins, washed tweed coat, Crimean shirt, blucher
    boots, soft felt hat, with a fresh-looking speckled handkerchief round his
    neck. But his face was mostly round and brown and jolly, his hands were always
    horny, and his beard grey. Sometimes he might have seemed strange and uncouth
    to us at first, but the old man never appeared the least surprised at anything
    he said or did&mdash;they understood each other so well&mdash;and we would
    soon take to this relic of our father&rsquo;s past, who would have fruit
    or lollies for us&mdash;strange that he always remembered them&mdash;and
    would surreptitiously slip &ldquo;shilluns&rdquo; into our dirty little hands,
    and tell us stories about the old days, &ldquo;when me an&rsquo; yer father
    was on the diggin&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; you wasn&rsquo;t thought of, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sometimes the old mate would stay over Sunday, and in the forenoon or after
    dinner he and father would take a walk amongst the deserted shafts of Sapling
    Gully or along Quartz Ridge, and criticize old ground, and talk of past diggers&rsquo;  mistakes,
    and second bottoms, and feelers, and dips, and leads&mdash;also outcrops&mdash;and
    absently pick up pieces of quartz and slate, rub them on their sleeves, look
    at them in an abstracted manner, and drop them again; and they would talk
    of some old lead they had worked on: &ldquo;Hogan&rsquo;s party was here
    on one side of us, Macintosh was here on the other, Mac was getting good
    gold and so was Hogan, and now, why the blanky blank weren&rsquo;t we on
    gold?&rdquo; And the mate would always agree that there was  &ldquo;gold
    in them ridges and gullies yet, if a man only had the money behind him to
    git at it.&rdquo; And then perhaps the guv&rsquo;nor would show him a spot
    where he intended to put down a shaft some day&mdash;the old man was always
    thinking of putting down a shaft. And these two old fifty-niners would mooch
    round and sit on their heels on the sunny mullock heaps and break clay lumps
    between their hands, and lay plans for the putting down of shafts, and smoke,
    till an urchin was sent to &ldquo;look for his father and Mr So-and-so, and
    tell &rsquo;em to come to their dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And again&mdash;mostly in the fresh of the morning&mdash;they would hang
    about the fences on the selection and review the live stock: five dusty skeletons
    of cows, a hollow-sided calf or two, and one shocking piece of equine scenery&mdash;which,
    by the way, the old mate always praised. But the selector&rsquo;s heart was
    not in farming nor on selections&mdash;it was far away with the last new
    rush in Western Australia or Queensland, or perhaps buried in the worked-out
    ground of Tambaroora, Married Man&rsquo;s Creek, or Araluen; and by-and-by
    the memory of some half-forgotten reef or lead or Last Chance, Nil Desperandum,
    or Brown Snake claim would take their thoughts far back and away from the
    dusty patch of sods and struggling sprouts called the crop, or the few discouraged,
    half-dead slips which comprised the orchard. Then their conversation would
    be pointed with many Golden Points, Bakery Hill, Deep Creeks, Maitland Bars,
    Specimen Flats, and Chinamen&rsquo;s Gullies. And so they&rsquo;d yarn till
    the youngster came to tell them that &ldquo;Mother sez the breakfus is gettin&rsquo; cold,&rdquo; and
    then the old mate would rouse himself and stretch and say, &ldquo;Well, we
    mustn&rsquo;t keep the missus waitin&rsquo;, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, after tea, they would sit on a log of the wood-heap, or the edge of
    the veranda&mdash;that is, in warm weather&mdash;and yarn about Ballarat
    and Bendigo&mdash;of the days when we spoke of being on a place oftener than
    at it: <i>on</i> Ballarat, <i>on</i> Gulgong, <i>on</i> Lambing Flat, on <i>Creswick</i>&mdash;and
    they would use the definite article before the names, as: &ldquo;on The Turon;
    The Lachlan; The Home Rule; The Canadian Lead.&rdquo; Then again they&rsquo;d
    yarn of old mates, such as Tom Brook, Jack Henright, and poor Martin Ratcliffe&mdash;who
    was killed in his golden hole&mdash;and of other men whom they didn&rsquo;t
    seem to have known much about, and who went by the names of &ldquo;Adelaide
    Adolphus,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Corney George,&rdquo; and other names which might
    have been more or less applicable.</p>
  <p>And sometimes they&rsquo;d get talking, low and mysterious like, about &ldquo;Th&rsquo;  Eureka
    Stockade;&rdquo; and if we didn&rsquo;t understand and asked questions, &ldquo;what
    was the Eureka Stockade?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what did they do it for?&rdquo; father&rsquo;d
    say: &ldquo;Now, run away, sonny, and don&rsquo;t bother; me and Mr So-and-so
    want to talk.&rdquo; Father had the mark of a hole on his leg, which he said
    he got through a gun accident when a boy, and a scar on his side, that we
    saw when he was in swimming with us; he said he got that in an accident in
    a quartz-crushing machine. Mr So-and-so had a big scar on the side of his
    forehead that was caused by a pick accidentally slipping out of a loop in
    the rope, and falling down a shaft where he was working. But how was it they
    talked low, and their eyes brightened up, and they didn&rsquo;t look at each
    other, but away over sunset, and had to get up and walk about, and take a
    stroll in the cool of the evening when they talked about Eureka?</p>
  <p>And, again they&rsquo;d talk lower and more mysterious like, and perhaps
    mother would be passing the wood-heap and catch a word, and asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who was she, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Tom&mdash;father&mdash;would say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t know her, Mary; she belonged to a family Bill
    knew at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Bill would look solemn till mother had gone, and then they would smile
    a quiet smile, and stretch and say, &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; and start something
    else.</p>
  <p>They had yarns for the fireside, too, some of those old mates of our father&rsquo;s,
    and one of them would often tell how a girl&mdash;a queen of the diggings&mdash;was
    married, and had her wedding-ring made out of the gold of that field; and
    how the diggers weighed their gold with the new wedding-ring&mdash;for luck&mdash;by
    hanging the ring on the hook of the scales and attaching their chamois-leather
    gold bags to it (whereupon she boasted that four hundred ounces of the precious
    metal passed through her wedding-ring); and how they lowered the young bride,
    blindfolded, down a golden hole in a big bucket, and got her to point out
    the drive from which the gold came that her ring was made out of. The point
    of this story seems to have been lost&mdash;or else we forget it&mdash;but
    it was characteristic. Had the girl been lowered down a duffer, and asked
    to point out the way to the gold, and had she done so successfully, there
    would have been some sense in it.</p>
  <p>And they would talk of King, and Maggie Oliver, and G. V. Brooke, and others,
    and remember how the diggers went five miles out to meet the coach that brought
    the girl actress, and took the horses out and brought her in in triumph,
    and worshipped her, and sent her off in glory, and threw nuggets into her
    lap. And how she stood upon the box-seat and tore her sailor hat to pieces,
    and threw the fragments amongst the crowd; and how the diggers fought for
    the bits and thrust them inside their shirt bosoms; and how she broke down
    and cried, and could in her turn have worshipped those men&mdash;loved them,
    every one. They were boys all, and gentlemen all. There were college men,
    artists, poets, musicians, journalists&mdash;Bohemians all. Men from all
    the lands and one. They understood art&mdash;and poverty was dead.</p>
  <p>And perhaps the old mate would say slyly, but with a sad, quiet smile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got that bit of straw yet, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Those old mates had each three pasts behind them. The two they told each
    other when they became mates, and the one they had shared.</p>
  <p>And when the visitor had gone by the coach we noticed that the old man would
    smoke a lot, and think as much, and take great interest in the fire, and
    be a trifle irritable perhaps.</p>
  <p>Those old mates of our father&rsquo;s are getting few and far between, and
    only happen along once in a way to keep the old man&rsquo;s memory fresh,
    as it were. We met one to-day, and had a yarn with him, and afterwards we
    got thinking, and somehow began to wonder whether those ancient friends of
    ours were, or were not, better and kinder to their mates than we of the rising
    generation are to our fathers; and the doubt is painfully on the wrong side.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SettlingOnTheLand"></a>Settling On The Land</b></h2>
  <p>The worst bore in Australia just now is the man who raves about getting
    the people on the land, and button-holes you in the street with a little
    scheme of his own. He generally does not know what he is talking about.</p>
  <p>There is in Sydney a man named Tom Hopkins who settled on the land once,
    and sometimes you can get him to talk about it. He did very well at his trade
    in the city, years ago, until he began to think that he could do better up-country.
    Then he arranged with his sweetheart to be true to him and wait whilst he
    went west and made a home. She drops out of the story at this point.</p>
  <p>He selected on a run at Dry Hole Creek, and for months awaited the arrival
    of the government surveyors to fix his boundaries; but they didn&rsquo;t
    come, and, as he had no reason to believe they would turn up within the next
    ten years, he grubbed and fenced at a venture, and started farming operations.</p>
  <p>Does the reader know what grubbing means? Tom does. He found the biggest,
    ugliest, and most useless trees on his particular piece of ground; also the
    greatest number of adamantine stumps. He started without experience, or with
    very little, but with plenty of advice from men who knew less about farming
    than he did. He found a soft place between two roots on one side of the first
    tree, made a narrow, irregular hole, and burrowed down till he reached a
    level where the tap-root was somewhat less than four feet in diameter, and
    not quite as hard as flint: then he found that he hadn&rsquo;t room to swing
    the axe, so he heaved out another ton or two of earth&mdash;and rested. Next
    day he sank a shaft on the other side of the gum; and after tea, over a pipe,
    it struck him that it would be a good idea to burn the tree out, and so use
    up the logs and lighter rubbish lying round. So he widened the excavation,
    rolled in some logs, and set fire to them&mdash;with no better result than
    to scorch the roots.</p>
  <p>Tom persevered. He put the trace harness on his horse, drew in all the logs
    within half a mile, and piled them on the windward side of that gum; and
    during the night the fire found a soft place, and the tree burnt off about
    six feet above the surface, falling on a squatter&rsquo;s boundary fence,
    and leaving the ugliest kind of stump to occupy the selector&rsquo;s attention;
    which it did, for a week. He waited till the hole cooled, and then he went
    to work with pick, shovel, and axe: and even now he gets interested in drawings
    of machinery, such as are published in the agricultural weeklies, for getting
    out stumps without graft. He thought he would be able to get some posts and
    rails out of that tree, but found reason to think that a cast-iron column
    would split sooner&mdash;and straighter. He traced some of the surface roots
    to the other side of the selection, and broke most of his trace-chains trying
    to get them out by horse-power&mdash;for they had other roots going down
    from underneath. He cleared a patch in the course of time and for several
    seasons he broke more ploughshares than he could pay for.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the squatter was not idle. Tom&rsquo;s tent was robbed several
    times, and his hut burnt down twice. Then he was charged with killing some
    sheep and a steer on the run, and converting them to his own use, but got
    off mainly because there was a difference of opinion between the squatter
    and the other local J.P. concerning politics and religion.</p>
  <p>Tom ploughed and sowed wheat, but nothing came up to speak of&mdash;the
    ground was too poor; so he carted stable manure six miles from the nearest
    town, manured the land, sowed another crop, and prayed for rain. It came.
    It raised a flood which washed the crop clean off the selection, together
    with several acres of manure, and a considerable portion of the original
    surface soil; and the water brought down enough sand to make a beach, and
    spread it over the field to a depth of six inches. The flood also took half
    a mile of fencing from along the creek-bank, and landed it in a bend, three
    miles down, on a dummy selection, where it was confiscated.</p>
  <p>Tom didn&rsquo;t give up&mdash;he was energetic. He cleared another piece
    of ground on the siding, and sowed more wheat; it had the rust in it, or
    the smut&mdash;and averaged three shillings per bushel. Then he sowed lucerne
    and oats, and bought a few cows: he had an idea of starting a dairy. First,
    the cows&rsquo; eyes got bad, and he sought the advice of a German cocky,
    and acted upon it; he blew powdered alum through paper tubes into the bad
    eyes, and got some of it snorted and butted back into his own. He cured the
    cows&rsquo; eyes and got the sandy blight in his own, and for a week or so
    be couldn&rsquo;t tell one end of a cow from the other, but sat in a dark
    corner of the hut and groaned, and soaked his glued eyelashes in warm water.
    Germany stuck to him and nursed him, and saw him through.</p>
  <p>Then the milkers got bad udders, and Tom took his life in his hands whenever
    he milked them. He got them all right presently&mdash;and butter fell to
    fourpence a pound. He and the aforesaid cocky made arrangements to send their
    butter to a better market; and then the cows contracted a disease which was
    known in those parts as &ldquo;plooro permoanyer,&rdquo; but generally referred
    to as &ldquo;th&rsquo; ploorer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Tom sought advice, acting upon which he slit the cows&rsquo; ears,
    cut their tails half off to bleed them, and poured pints of &ldquo;pain killer&rdquo; into
    them through their nostrils; but they wouldn&rsquo;t make an effort, except,
    perhaps, to rise and poke the selector when he tried to tempt their appetites
    with slices of immature pumpkin. They died peacefully and persistently, until
    all were gone save a certain dangerous, barren, slab-sided luny bovine with
    white eyes and much agility in jumping fences, who was known locally as Queen
    Elizabeth.</p>
  <p>Tom shot Queen Elizabeth, and turned his attention to agriculture again.
    Then his plough horses took bad with some thing the Teuton called &ldquo;der
    shtranguls.&rdquo;  He submitted them to a course of treatment in accordance
    with Jacob&rsquo;s advice&mdash;and they died.</p>
  <p>Even then Tom didn&rsquo;t give in&mdash;there was grit in that man. He
    borrowed a broken-down dray-horse in return for its keep, coupled it with
    his own old riding hack, and started to finish ploughing. The team wasn&rsquo;t
    a success. Whenever the draught horse&rsquo;s knees gave way and he stumbled
    forward, he jerked the lighter horse back into the plough, and something
    would break. Then Tom would blaspheme till he was refreshed, mend up things
    with wire and bits of clothes-line, fill his pockets with stones to throw
    at the team, and start again. Finally he hired a dummy&rsquo;s child to drive
    the horses. The brat did his best he tugged at the head of the team, prodded
    it behind, heaved rocks at it, cut a sapling, got up his enthusiasm, and
    wildly whacked the light horse whenever the other showed signs of moving&mdash;but
    he never succeeded in starting both horses at one and the same time. Moreover
    the youth was cheeky, and the selector&rsquo;s temper had been soured: he
    cursed the boy along with the horses, the plough, the selection, the squatter,
    and Australia. Yes, he cursed Australia. The boy cursed back, was chastised,
    and immediately went home and brought his father.</p>
  <p>Then the dummy&rsquo;s dog tackled the selector&rsquo;s dog and this precipitated
    things. The dummy would have gone under had his wife not arrived on the scene
    with the eldest son and the rest of the family. They all fell foul of Tom.
    The woman was the worst. The selector&rsquo;s dog chawed the other and came
    to his master&rsquo;s rescue just in time&mdash;or Tom Hopkins would never
    have lived to become the inmate of a lunatic asylum.</p>
  <p>Next year there happened to be good grass on Tom&rsquo;s selection and nowhere
    else, and he thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea&mdash;to get a few poor
    sheep, and fatten them up for market: sheep were selling for about seven-and-sixpence
    a dozen at that time. Tom got a hundred or two, but the squatter had a man
    stationed at one side of the selection with dogs to set on the sheep directly
    they put their noses through the fence (Tom&rsquo;s was not a sheep fence).
    The dogs chased the sheep across the selection and into the run again on
    the other side, where another man waited ready to pound them.</p>
  <p>Tom&rsquo;s dog did his best; but he fell sick while chawing up the fourth
    capitalistic canine, and subsequently died. The dummies had robbed that cur
    with poison before starting it across&mdash;that was the only way they could
    get at Tom&rsquo;s dog.</p>
  <p>Tom thought that two might play at the game, and he tried; but his nephew,
    who happened to be up from the city on a visit, was arrested at the instigation
    of the squatter for alleged sheep-stealing, and sentenced to two years&rsquo; hard;
    during which time the selector himself got six months for assaulting the
    squatter with intent to do him grievous bodily harm-which, indeed, he more
    than attempted, if a broken nose, a fractured jaw, and the loss of most of
    the squatters&rsquo; teeth amounted to anything. The squatter by this time
    had made peace with the other local Justice, and had become his father-in-law.</p>
  <p>When Tom came out there was little left for him to live for; but he took
    a job of fencing, got a few pounds together, and prepared to settle on the
    land some more. He got a &ldquo;missus&rdquo; and a few cows during the next
    year; the missus robbed him and ran away with the dummy, and the cows died
    in the drought, or were impounded by the squatter while on their way to water.
    Then Tom rented an orchard up the creek, and a hailstorm destroyed all the
    fruit. Germany happened to be represented at the time, Jacob having sought
    shelter at Tom&rsquo;s hut on his way home from town. Tom stood leaning against
    the door post with the hail beating on him through it all. His eyes were
    very bright and very dry, and every breath was a choking sob. Jacob let him
    stand there, and sat inside with a dreamy expression on his hard face, thinking
    of childhood and fatherland, perhaps. When it was over he led Tom to a stool
    and said, &ldquo;You waits there, Tom. I must go home for somedings. You
    sits there still and waits twenty minutes;&rdquo; then he got on his horse
    and rode off muttering to himself; &ldquo;Dot man moost gry, dot man moost
    gry.&rdquo; He was back inside of twenty minutes with a bottle of wine and
    a cornet under his overcoat. He poured the wine into two pint-pots, made
    Tom drink, drank himself, and then took his cornet, stood up at the door,
    and played a German march into the rain after the retreating storm. The hail
    had passed over his vineyard and he was a ruined man too. Tom did &ldquo;gry&rdquo;  and
    was all right. He was a bit disheartened, but he did another job of fencing,
    and was just beginning to think about &ldquo;puttin&rsquo; in a few vines
    an&rsquo; fruit-trees&rdquo; when the government surveyors&mdash;whom he&rsquo;d
    forgotten all about&mdash;had a resurrection and came and surveyed, and found
    that the real selection was located amongst some barren ridges across the
    creek. Tom reckoned it was lucky he didn&rsquo;t plant the orchard, and he
    set about shifting his home and fences to the new site. But the squatter
    interfered at this point, entered into possession of the farm and all on
    it, and took action against the selector for trespass&mdash;laying the damages
    at &pound;2500.</p>
  <p>Tom was admitted to the lunatic asylum at Parramatta next year, and the
    squatter was sent there the following summer, having been ruined by the drought,
    the rabbits, the banks, and a wool-ring. The two became very friendly, and
    had many a sociable argument about the feasibility&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;of
    blowing open the flood-gates of Heaven in a dry season with dynamite.</p>
  <p>Tom was discharged a few years since. He knocks about certain suburbs a
    good deal. He is seen in daylight seldom, and at night mostly in connection
    with a dray and a lantern. He says his one great regret is that he wasn&rsquo;t
    found to be of unsound mind before he went up-country.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="EnterMitchell"></a>Enter Mitchell</b></h2>
  <p>The Western train had just arrived at Redfern railway station with a lot
    of ordinary passengers and one swagman.</p>
  <p>He was short, and stout, and bow-legged, and freckled, and sandy. He had
    red hair and small, twinkling, grey eyes, and&mdash;what often goes with
    such things&mdash;the expression of a born comedian. He was dressed in a
    ragged, well-washed print shirt, an old black waistcoat with a calico back,
    a pair of cloudy moleskins patched at the knees and held up by a plaited
    greenhide belt buckled loosely round his hips, a pair of well-worn, fuzzy
    blucher boots, and a soft felt hat, green with age, and with no brim worth
    mentioning, and no crown to speak of. He swung a swag on to the platform,
    shouldered it, pulled out a billy and water-bag, and then went to a dog-box
    in the brake van.</p>
  <p>Five minutes later he appeared on the edge of the cab platform, with an
    anxious-looking cattle-dog crouching against his legs, and one end of the
    chain in his hand. He eased down the swag against a post, turned his face
    to the city, tilted his hat forward, and scratched the well-developed back
    of his head with a little finger. He seemed undecided what track to take.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cab, Sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The swagman turned slowly and regarded cabby with a quiet grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, do I look as if I want a cab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why not? No harm, anyway&mdash;I thought you might want a cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swaggy scratched his head, reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the first man that has
    thought so these ten years. What do I want with a cab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To go where you&rsquo;re going, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do I look knocked up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t say you said I did.... Now, I&rsquo;ve been on
    the track this five years. I&rsquo;ve tramped two thousan&rsquo; miles since
    last Chris&rsquo;mas, and I don&rsquo;t see why I can&rsquo;t tramp the last
    mile. Do you think my old dog wants a cab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dog shivered and whimpered; he seemed to want to get away from the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then, you see, you ain&rsquo;t going to carry that swag through
    the streets, are you?&rdquo; asked the cabman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Who&rsquo;ll stop me! There ain&rsquo;t no law agin it,
    I b&rsquo;lieve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then, you see, it don&rsquo;t look well, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I thought we&rsquo;d get to it at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The traveller up-ended his bluey against his knee, gave it an affectionate
    pat, and then straightened himself up and looked fixedly at the cabman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; he said, sternly and impressively, &ldquo;can
    you see anything wrong with that old swag o&rsquo; mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a stout, dumpy swag, with a red blanket outside, patched with blue,
    and the edge of a blue blanket showing in the inner rings at the end. The
    swag might have been newer; it might have been cleaner; it might have been
    hooped with decent straps, instead of bits of clothes-line and greenhide&mdash;but
    otherwise there was nothing the matter with it, as swags go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve humped that old swag for years,&rdquo; continued the bushman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    carried that old swag thousands of miles&mdash;as that old dog knows&mdash;an&rsquo; no
    one ever bothered about the look of it, or of me, or of my old dog, neither;
    and do you think I&rsquo;m going to be ashamed of that old swag, for a cabby
    or anyone else? Do you think I&rsquo;m going to study anybody&rsquo;s feelings?
    No one ever studied mine! I&rsquo;m in two minds to summon you for using
    insulting language towards me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lifted the swag by the twisted towel which served for a shoulder-strap,
    swung it into the cab, got in himself and hauled the dog after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can drive me somewhere where I can leave my swag and dog while
    I get some decent clothes to see a tailor in,&rdquo; he said to the cabman. &ldquo;My
    old dog ain&rsquo;t used to cabs, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he added, reflectively: &ldquo;I drove a cab myself, once, for five
    years in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="StiffnerAndJim"></a>Stiffner And Jim<br>
      <font size="+1">(Thirdly, Bill)</font></b></h2>
  <p>We were tramping down in Canterbury, Maoriland, at the time, swagging it&mdash;me
    and Bill&mdash;looking for work on the new railway line. Well, one afternoon,
    after a long, hot tramp, we comes to Stiffner&rsquo;s Hotel&mdash;between
    Christchurch and that other place&mdash;I forget the name of it&mdash;with
    throats on us like sunstruck bones, and not the price of a stick of tobacco.</p>
  <p>We had to have a drink, anyway, so we chanced it. We walked right into the
    bar, handed over our swags, put up four drinks, and tried to look as if we&rsquo;d
    just drawn our cheques and didn&rsquo;t care a curse for any man. We looked
    solvent enough, as far as swagmen go. We were dirty and haggard and ragged
    and tired-looking, and that was all the more reason why we might have our
    cheques all right.</p>
  <p>This Stiffner was a hard customer. He&rsquo;d been a spieler, fighting man,
    bush parson, temperance preacher, and a policeman, and a commercial traveller,
    and everything else that was damnable; he&rsquo;d been a journalist, and
    an editor; he&rsquo;d been a lawyer, too. He was an ugly brute to look at,
    and uglier to have a row with&mdash;about six-foot-six, wide in proportion,
    and stronger than Donald Dinnie.</p>
  <p>He was meaner than a gold-field Chinaman, and sharper than a sewer rat:
    he wouldn&rsquo;t give his own father a feed, nor lend him a sprat&mdash;unless
    some safe person backed the old man&rsquo;s I.O.U.</p>
  <p>We knew that we needn&rsquo;t expect any mercy from Stiffner; but something
    had to be done, so I said to Bill:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got to be done, Bill! What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill was mostly a quiet young chap, from Sydney, except when he got drunk&mdash;which
    was seldom&mdash;and then he was a customer, from all round. He was cracked
    on the subject of spielers. He held that the population of the world was
    divided into two classes&mdash;one was spielers and the other was the mugs.
    He reckoned that he wasn&rsquo;t a mug. At first I thought he was a spieler,
    and afterwards I thought that he was a mug. He used to say that a man had
    to do it these times; that he was honest once and a fool, and was robbed
    and starved in consequences by his friends and relations; but now he intended
    to take all that he could get. He said that you either had to have or be
    had; that men were driven to be sharps, and there was no help for it.</p>
  <p>Bill said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to sharpen our teeth, that&rsquo;s all, and chew
    somebody&rsquo;s lug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>There was a lot of navvies at the pub, and I knew one or two by sight, so
    Bill says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know one or two of these mugs. Bite one of their ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I took aside a chap that I knowed and bit his ear for ten bob,
    and gave it to Bill to mind, for I thought it would be safer with him than
    with me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang on to that,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t lose it for
    your natural life&rsquo;s sake, or Stiffner&rsquo;ll stiffen us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We put up about nine bob&rsquo;s worth of drinks that night&mdash;me and
    Bill&mdash;and Stiffner didn&rsquo;t squeal: he was too sharp. He shouted
    once or twice.</p>
  <p>By-and-by I left Bill and turned in, and in the morning when I woke up there
    was Bill sitting alongside of me, and looking about as lively as the fighting
    kangaroo in London in fog time. He had a black eye and eighteen pence. He&rsquo;d
    been taking down some of the mugs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Stiffner
    can smash us both with one hand, and if we don&rsquo;t pay up he&rsquo;ll
    pound our swags and cripple us. He&rsquo;s just the man to do it. He loves
    a fight even more than he hates being had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to be done, Jim,&rdquo; says Bill, in
    a tired, disinterested tone that made me mad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s than&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke be damned,&rdquo; I snarled, losing my temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know dashed well that our swags are in the bar, and we can&rsquo;t
    smoke without them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toss you to see who&rsquo;s
    to face the landlord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blessed!&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
    you further first. You have got a front. You mugged that stuff away, and
    you&rsquo;ll have to get us out of the mess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It made him wild to be called a mug, and we swore and growled at each other
    for a while; but we daren&rsquo;t speak loud enough to have a fight, so at
    last I agreed to toss up for it, and I lost.</p>
  <p>Bill started to give me some of his points, but I shut him up quick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your turn, and made a mess of it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;For
    God&rsquo;s sake give me a show. Now, I&rsquo;ll go into the bar and ask
    for the swags, and carry them out on to the veranda, and then go back to
    settle up. You keep him talking all the time. You dump the two swags together,
    and smoke like sheol. That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I went into the bar, got the swags from the missus, carried them out on
    to the veranda, and then went back.</p>
  <p>Stiffner came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; says Stiffner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a nice day, I think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. I suppose you are going on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll have to make a move to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then I hooked carelessly on to the counter with one elbow, and looked dreamy-like
    out across the clearing, and presently I gave a sort of sigh and said:  &ldquo;Ah,
    well! I think I&rsquo;ll have a beer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right you are! Where&rsquo;s your mate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s round at the back. He&rsquo;ll be round directly;
    but he ain&rsquo;t drinking this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stiffner laughed that nasty empty laugh of his. He thought Bill was whipping
    the cat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, boss?&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thankee!... Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The country was pretty open round there&mdash;the nearest timber was better
    than a mile away, and I wanted to give Bill a good start across the flat
    before the go-as-you-can commenced; so I talked for a while, and while we
    were talking I thought I might as well go the whole hog&mdash;I might as
    well die for a pound as a penny, if I had to die; and if I hadn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;d
    have the pound to the good, anyway, so to speak. Anyhow, the risk would be
    about the same, or less, for I might have the spirit to run harder the more
    I had to run for&mdash;the more spirits I had to run for, in fact, as it
    turned out&mdash;so I says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take one of them there flasks of whisky to last
    us on the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right y&rsquo;are,&rdquo; says Stiffner. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll ye
    have&mdash;a small one or a big one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, a big one, I think&mdash;if I can get it into my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a tight squeeze,&rdquo; he said, and he laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Bet you two drinks I&rsquo;ll
    get it in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The top inside coat-pocket, and no tearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a big bottle, and all my pockets were small; but I got it into the
    pocket he&rsquo;d betted against. It was a tight squeeze, but I got it in.</p>
  <p>Then we both laughed, but his laugh was nastier than usual, because it was
    meant to be pleasant, and he&rsquo;d lost two drinks; and my laugh wasn&rsquo;t
    easy&mdash;I was anxious as to which of us would laugh next.</p>
  <p>Just then I noticed something, and an idea struck me&mdash;about the most
    up-to-date idea that ever struck me in my life. I noticed that Stiffner was
    limping on his right foot this morning, so I said to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with your foot?&rdquo; putting my hand in my pocket. &ldquo;Oh,
    it&rsquo;s a crimson nail in my boot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought I
    got the blanky thing out this morning; but I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There just happened to be an old bag of shoemaker&rsquo;s tools in the bar,
    belonging to an old cobbler who was lying dead drunk on the veranda. So I
    said, taking my hand out of my pocket again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lend us the boot, and I&rsquo;ll fix it in a minute. That&rsquo;s
    my old trade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re a shoemaker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
    never have thought it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughs one of his useless laughs that wasn&rsquo;t wanted, and slips
    off the boot&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t laced it up&mdash;and hands it across
    the bar to me. It was an ugly brute&mdash;a great thick, iron-bound, boiler-plated
    navvy&rsquo;s boot. It made me feel sore when I looked at it.</p>
  <p>I got the bag and pretended to fix the nail; but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple of nails gone from the sole,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    put  &rsquo;em in if I can find any hobnails, and it&rsquo;ll save the sole,&rdquo; and
    I rooted in the bag and found a good long nail, and shoved it right through
    the sole on the sly. He&rsquo;d been a bit of a sprinter in his time, and
    I thought it might be better for me in the near future if the spikes of his
    running-shoes were inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, you&rsquo;ll find that better, I fancy,&rdquo; I said, standing
    the boot on the bar counter, but keeping my hand on it in an absent-minded
    kind of way. Presently I yawned and stretched myself, and said in a careless
    way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! How&rsquo;s the slate?&rdquo; He scratched the back of
    his head and pretended to think.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll call it thirty bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps he thought I&rsquo;d slap down two quid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and what will you do supposing we don&rsquo;t
    pay you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked blank for a moment. Then he fired up and gasped and choked once
    or twice; and then he cooled down suddenly and laughed his nastiest laugh&mdash;he
    was one of those men who always laugh when they&rsquo;re wild&mdash;and said
    in a nasty, quiet tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You thundering, jumped-up crawlers! If you don&rsquo;t (something)
    well part up I&rsquo;ll take your swags and (something) well kick your gory
    pants so you won&rsquo;t be able to sit down for a month&mdash;or stand up
    either!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the sooner you begin the better,&rdquo; I said; and I chucked
    the boot into a corner and bolted.</p>
  <p>He jumped the bar counter, got his boot, and came after me. He paused to
    slip the boot on&mdash;but he only made one step, and then gave a howl and
    slung the boot off and rushed back. When I looked round again he&rsquo;d
    got a slipper on, and was coming&mdash;and gaining on me, too. I shifted
    scenery pretty quick the next five minutes. But I was soon pumped. My heart
    began to beat against the ceiling of my head, and my lungs all choked up
    in my throat. When I guessed he was getting within kicking distance I glanced
    round so&rsquo;s to dodge the kick. He let out; but I shied just in time.
    He missed fire, and the slipper went about twenty feet up in the air and
    fell in a waterhole.</p>
  <p>He was done then, for the ground was stubbly and stony. I seen Bill on ahead
    pegging out for the horizon, and I took after him and reached for the timber
    for all I was worth, for I&rsquo;d seen Stiffner&rsquo;s missus coming with
    a shovel&mdash;to bury the remains, I suppose; and those two were a good
    match&mdash;Stiffner and his missus, I mean.</p>
  <p>Bill looked round once, and melted into the bush pretty soon after that.
    When I caught up he was about done; but I grabbed my swag and we pushed on,
    for I told Bill that I&rsquo;d seen Stiffner making for the stables when
    I&rsquo;d last looked round; and Bill thought that we&rsquo;d better get
    lost in the bush as soon as ever we could, and stay lost, too, for Stiffner
    was a man that couldn&rsquo;t stand being had.</p>
  <p>The first thing that Bill said when we got safe into camp was: &ldquo;I
    told you that we&rsquo;d pull through all right. You need never be frightened
    when you&rsquo;re travelling with me. Just take my advice and leave things
    to me, and we&rsquo;ll hang out all right. Now&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I shut him up. He made me mad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, you&mdash;! What the sheol did <i>you</i> do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I got away with the swags, didn&rsquo;t
    I? Where&rsquo;d they be now if it wasn&rsquo;t for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then I sat on him pretty hard for his pretensions, and paid him out for
    all the patronage he&rsquo;d worked off on me, and called him a mug straight,
    and walked round him, so to speak, and blowed, and told him never to pretend
    to me again that he was a battler.</p>
  <p>Then, when I thought I&rsquo;d licked him into form, I cooled down and soaped
    him up a bit; but I never thought that he had three climaxes and a crisis
    in store for me.</p>
  <p>He took it all pretty cool; he let me have my fling, and gave me time to
    get breath; then he leaned languidly over on his right side, shoved his left
    hand down into his left trouserpocket, and brought up a boot-lace, a box
    of matches, and nine-and-six.</p>
  <p>As soon as I got the focus of it I gasped:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where the deuce did you get that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had it all along,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I seen at the pub
    that you had the show to chew a lug, so I thought we&rsquo;d save it&mdash;nine-and-sixpences
    ain&rsquo;t picked up every day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he leaned over on his left, went down into the other pocket, and came
    up with a piece of tobacco and half-a-sovereign.</p>
  <p>My eyes bulged out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where the blazes did you get that from?&rdquo; I yelled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was the half-quid you give me last night.
    Half-quids ain&rsquo;t to be thrown away these times; and, besides, I had
    a down on Stiffner, and meant to pay him out; I reckoned that if we wasn&rsquo;t
    sharp enough to take him down we hadn&rsquo;t any business to be supposed
    to be alive. Anyway, I guessed we&rsquo;d do it; and so we did&mdash;and
    got a bottle of whisky into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he leaned back, tired-like, against the log, and dredged his upper
    left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and brought up a sovereign wrapped in a pound
    note. Then he waited for me to speak; but I couldn&rsquo;t. I got my mouth
    open, but couldn&rsquo;t get it shut again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got that out of the mugs last night, but I thought that we&rsquo;d
    want it, and might as well keep it. Quids ain&rsquo;t so easily picked up,
    nowadays; and, besides, we need stuff more&rsquo;n Stiffner does, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did he know you had the stuff?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s the fun of it. That&rsquo;s what made him so
    excited. He was in the parlour all the time I was playing. But we might as
    well have a drink!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We did. I wanted it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill turned in by-and-by, and looked like a sleeping innocent in the moonlight.
    I sat up late, and smoked, and thought hard, and watched Bill, and turned
    in, and thought till near daylight, and then went to sleep, and had a nightmare
    about it. I dreamed I chased Stiffner forty miles to buy his pub, and that
    Bill turned out to be his nephew.</p>
  <p>Bill divvied up all right, and gave me half a crown over, but I didn&rsquo;t
    travel with him long after that. He was a decent young fellow as far as chaps
    go, and a good mate as far as mates go; but he was too far ahead for a peaceful,
    easy-going chap like me. It would have worn me out in a year to keep up to
    him.</p>
  <p>P.S.&mdash;The name of this should have been: &lsquo;Bill and Stiffner (thirdly,
    Jim)&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>When The Sun Went Down</b><a name="WhenTheSunWentDown"></a></h2>
  <p>Jack Drew sat on the edge of the shaft, with his foot in the loop and one
    hand on the rope, ready to descend. His elder brother, Tom, stood at one
    end of the windlass and the third mate at the other. Jack paused before swinging
    off, looked up at his brother, and impulsively held out his hand:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to let the sun go down, are you, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Tom kept both hands on the windlass-handle and said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lower away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They lowered him to the bottom, and Tom shouldered his pick in silence and
    walked off to the tent. He found the tin plate, pint-pot, and things set
    ready for him on the rough slab table under the bush shed. The tea was made,
    the cabbage and potatoes strained and placed in a billy near the fire. He
    found the fried bacon and steak between two plates in the camp-oven. He sat
    down to the table but he could not eat. He felt mean. The inexperience and
    hasty temper of his brother had caused the quarrel between them that morning;
    but then Jack admitted that, and apologized when he first tried to make it
    up.</p>
  <p>Tom moved round uneasily and tried to smoke: he could not get Jack&rsquo;s
    last appeal out of his ears&mdash;&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to let the
    sun go down, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom found himself glancing at the sun. It was less than two hours from sunset.
    He thought of the words of the old Hebrew&mdash;or Chinese&mdash;poet; he
    wasn&rsquo;t religious, and the authorship didn&rsquo;t matter. The old poet&rsquo;s
    words began to haunt him &ldquo;Let not the sun go down upon your wrath&mdash;Let
    not the sun go down upon your wrath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The line contains good, sound advice; for quick-tempered men are often the
    most sensitive, and when they let the sun go down on the aforesaid wrath
    that quality is likely to get them down and worry them during the night.</p>
  <p>Tom started to go to the claim, but checked himself, and sat down and tried
    to draw comfort from his pipe. He understood his brother thoroughly, but
    his brother never understood him&mdash;that was where the trouble was. Presently
    he got thinking how Jack would worry about the quarrel and have no heart
    for his work. Perhaps he was fretting over it now, all alone by himself,
    down at the end of the damp, dark drive. Tom had a lot of the old woman about
    him, in spite of his unsociable ways and brooding temper.</p>
  <p>He had almost made up his mind to go below again, on some excuse, when his
    mate shouted from the top of the shaft:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom! Tom! For Christ&rsquo;s sake come here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom&rsquo;s heart gave a great thump, and he ran like a kangaroo to the
    shaft. All the diggers within hearing were soon on the spot. They saw at
    a glance what had happened. It was madness to sink without timber in such
    treacherous ground. <i>The sides of the shaft were closing in</i>. Tom sprang
    forward and shouted through the crevice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the face, Jack! To the face, for your life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old Workings!&rdquo; he cried, turning to the diggers. &ldquo;Bring
    a fan and tools. We&rsquo;ll dig him out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few minutes later a fan was rigged over a deserted shaft close by, where
    fortunately the windlass had been left for bailing purposes, and men were
    down in the old drive. Tom knew that he and his mates had driven very close
    to the old workings.</p>
  <p>He knelt in the damp clay before the face and worked like a madman; he refused
    to take turn about, and only dropped the pick to seize a shovel in his strong
    hands, and snatch back the loose clay from under his feet; he reckoned that
    he had six or, perhaps, eight feet to drive, and he knew that the air could
    not last long in the new drive&mdash;even if that had not already fallen
    in and crushed his brother. Great drops of perspiration stood out on Tom&rsquo;s
    forehead, and his breath began to come in choking sobs, but he still struck
    strong, savage blows into the clay before him, and the drive lengthened quickly.
    Once he paused a moment to listen, and then distinctly heard a sound as of
    a tool or stone being struck against the end of the new drive. Jack was safe!</p>
  <p>Tom dug on until the clay suddenly fell away from his pick and left a hole,
    about the size of a plate, in the &ldquo;face&rdquo; before him. &ldquo;Thank
    God!&rdquo; said a hoarse, strained voice at the other side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, old man; you are just in time; I&rsquo;ve hardly got room to
    stand in, and I&rsquo;m nearly smothered.&rdquo; He was crouching against
    the &ldquo;face&rdquo; of the new drive.</p>
  <p>Tom dropped his pick and fell back against the man behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, God! my back!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he struggled to his knees, and then fell forward on his hand and
    dragged himself close to the hole in the end of the drive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, old man; what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hurt my heart, Jack!&mdash;Put your hand&mdash;quick!...
    The sun&rsquo;s going down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack&rsquo;s hand came out through the hole, Tom gripped it, and then fell
    with his face in the damp clay.</p>
  <p>They half carried, half dragged him from the drive, for the roof was low
    and they were obliged to stoop. They took him to the shaft and sent him up,
    lashed to the rope.</p>
  <p>A few blows of the pick, and Jack scrambled from his prison and went to
    the surface, and knelt on the grass by the body of his brother. The diggers
    gathered round and took off their hats. And the sun went down.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheManWhoForgot"></a>The Man Who Forgot</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno,&rdquo; said Tom Marshall&mdash;known as &ldquo;The
    Oracle&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd o&rsquo; sich cases before: they
    ain&rsquo;t commin, but&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heerd o&rsquo; sich cases before,&rdquo; and
    he screwed up the left side of his face whilst he reflectively scraped his
    capacious right ear with the large blade of a pocket-knife.</p>
  <p>They were sitting at the western end of the rouseabouts&rsquo; hut, enjoying
    the breeze that came up when the sun went down, and smoking and yarning.
    The &ldquo;case&rdquo;  in question was a wretchedly forlorn-looking specimen
    of the swag-carrying clan whom a boundary-rider had found wandering about
    the adjacent plain, and had brought into the station. He was a small, scraggy
    man, painfully fair, with a big, baby-like head, vacant watery eyes, long
    thin hairy hands, that felt like pieces of damp seaweed, and an apologetic
    cringe-and-look-up-at-you manner. He professed to have forgotten who he was
    and all about himself.</p>
  <p>The Oracle was deeply interested in this case, as indeed he was in anything
    else that &ldquo;looked curious.&rdquo; He was a big, simple-minded shearer,
    with more heart than brains, more experience than sense, and more curiosity
    than either. It was a wonder that he had not profited, even indirectly, by
    the last characteristic. His heart was filled with a kind of reverential
    pity for anyone who was fortunate or unfortunate enough to possess an &ldquo;affliction;&rdquo; and
    amongst his mates had been counted a deaf man, a blind man, a poet, and a
    man who &ldquo;had rats.&rdquo; Tom had dropped across them individually,
    when they were down in the world, and had befriended them, and studied them
    with great interest&mdash;especially the poet; and they thought kindly of
    him, and were grateful&mdash;except the individual with the rats, who reckoned
    Tom had an axe to grind&mdash;that he, in fact, wanted to cut his (Rat&rsquo;s)
    liver out as a bait for Darling cod&mdash;and so renounced the mateship.</p>
  <p>It was natural, then, for The Oracle to take the present case under his
    wing. He used his influence with the boss to get the Mystery on &ldquo;picking
    up,&rdquo;  and studied him in spare time, and did his best to assist the
    poor hushed memory, which nothing the men could say or do seemed able to
    push further back than the day on which the stranger &ldquo;kind o&rsquo; woke
    up&rdquo; on the plain, and found a swag beside him. The swag had been prospected
    and fossicked for a clue, but yielded none. The chaps were sceptical at first,
    and inclined to make fun of the Mystery; but Tom interfered, and intimated
    that if they were skunks enough to chyack or try on any of their &ldquo;funny
    business&rdquo; with a &ldquo;pore afflicted chap,&rdquo; he (Tom) would
    be obliged to &ldquo;perform.&rdquo; Most of the men there had witnessed
    Tom&rsquo;s performance, and no one seemed ambitious to take a leading part
    in it. They preferred to be in the audience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; reflected The Oracle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a curious case,
    and I dare say some of them big doctors, like Morell Mackenzie, would be
    glad to give a thousand or two to get holt on a case like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; cried Mitchell, the goat of the shed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    go halves!&mdash;or stay, let&rsquo;s form a syndicate and work the Mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some of the rouseabouts laughed, but the joke fell as flat with Tom as any
    other joke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; said the Mystery himself, in the whine
    that was natural to him, and with a timid side look up at Tom&mdash;&ldquo;the
    worst of it is I might be a lord or duke, and don&rsquo;t know anything about
    it. I might be a rich man, with a lot of houses and money. I might be a lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps guffawed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;yer laughing at?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    see anything unreasonable about it; he might be a lord as far as looks go.
    I&rsquo;ve seen two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; reflected Tom, ignoring Mitchell, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    something in that; but then again, you see, you might be Jack the Ripper.
    Better let it slide, mate; let the dead past bury its dead. Start fresh with
    a clean sheet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t even know my name, or whether I&rsquo;m married
    or not,&rdquo; whined the outcast. &ldquo;I might have a good wife and little
    ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better keep on forgetting, mate,&rdquo; Mitchell said, &ldquo;and
    as for a name, that&rsquo;s nothing. I don&rsquo;t know mine, and I&rsquo;ve
    had eight. There&rsquo;s plenty good names knocking round. I knew a man named
    Jim Smith that died. Take his name, it just suits you, and he ain&rsquo;t
    likely to call round for it; if he does, you can say you was born with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So they called him Smith, and soon began to regard him as a harmless lunatic
    and to take no notice of his eccentricities. Great interest was taken in
    the case for a time, and even Mitchell put in his oar and tried all sorts
    of ways to assist the Mystery in his weak, helpless, and almost pitiful endeavours
    to recollect who he was. A similar case happened to appear in the papers
    at this time, and the thing caught on to such an extent that The Oracle was
    moved to impart some advice from his store of wisdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think too much over it if I was you,&rdquo; said
    he to Mitchell,  &ldquo;hundreds of sensible men went mad over that there
    Tichborne case who didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it, but just through
    thinking on it; and you&rsquo;re ratty enough already, Jack. Let it alone
    and trust me to find out who&rsquo;s Smith just as soon as ever we cut out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Smith ate, worked, and slept, and borrowed tobacco and forgot
    to return it&mdash;which was made a note of. He talked freely about his case
    when asked, but if he addressed anyone, it was with the air of the timid
    but good young man, who is fully aware of the extent and power of this world&rsquo;s
    wickedness, and stands somewhat in awe of it, but yet would beg you to favour
    a humble worker in the vineyard by kindly accepting a tract, and passing
    it on to friends after perusal.</p>
  <p>One Saturday morning, about a fortnight before cut out, The Oracle came
    late to his stand, and apparently with something on his mind. Smith hadn&rsquo;t
    turned up, and the next rouseabout was doing his work, to the mutual dissatisfaction
    of all parties immediately concerned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of Smith?&rdquo; asked Mitchell of The Oracle. &ldquo;Seems
    to have forgot to get up this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom looked disheartened and disappointed. <i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgot again</i>,&rdquo;  said
    he, slowly and impressively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgot what? We know he&rsquo;s blessed well forgot to come to graft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgot again,&rdquo; repeated Tom. &ldquo;He woke up this
    morning and wanted to know who he was and where he was.&rdquo; Comments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better give him best, Oracle,&rdquo; said Mitchell presently. &ldquo;If
    he can&rsquo;t find out who he is and where he is, the boss&rsquo;ll soon
    find it out for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;when I take a thing in hand I see it
    through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was also characteristic of the boss-over-the-board, though in another
    direction. He went down to the hut and inquired for Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t you at work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who am I, sir? Where am I?&rdquo; whined Smith. &ldquo;Can you please
    tell me who I am and where I am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss drew a long breath and stared blankly at the Mystery; then he erupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; he howled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who the
    gory sheol you are, except that you&rsquo;re a gory lunatic, and what&rsquo;s
    more, I don&rsquo;t care a damn. But I&rsquo;ll soon show you where you are!
    You can call up at the store and get your cheque, and soon as you blessed
    well like; and then take a walk, and don&rsquo;t forget to take your lovely
    swag with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The matter was discussed at the dinner-table. The Oracle swore that it was
    a cruel, mean way to treat a &ldquo;pore afflicted chap,&rdquo; and cursed
    the boss. Tom&rsquo;s admirers cursed in sympathy, and trouble seemed threatening,
    when the voice of Mitchell was heard to rise in slow, deliberate tones over
    the clatter of cutlery and tin plates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;I wonder whether Smith forgot
    his cheque?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was ascertained that Smith hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>There was some eating and thinking done. Soon Mitchell&rsquo;s voice was
    heard again, directed at The Oracle.</p>
  <p>It said &ldquo;Do you keep any vallabels about your bunk, Oracle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom looked hard at Mitchell. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;: only I think it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea for
    you to look at your bunk and see whether Smith forgot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps grew awfully interested. They fixed their eyes on Tom, and he
    looked with feeling from one face to another; then he pushed his plate back,
    and slowly extracted his long legs from between the stool and the table.
    He climbed to his bunk, and carefully reviewed the ingredients of his swag.
    Smith hadn&rsquo;t forgot.</p>
  <p>When The Oracle&rsquo;s face came round again there was in it a strange
    expression which a close study would have revealed to be more of anger than
    of sorrow, but that was not all. It was an expression such as a man might
    wear who is undergoing a terrible operation, without chloroform, but is determined
    not to let a whimper escape him. Tom didn&rsquo;t swear, and by that token
    they guessed how mad he was. &rsquo;Twas a rough shed, with a free and lurid
    vocabulary, but had they all sworn in chorus, with One-eyed Bogan as lead,
    it would not have done justice to Tom&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;and they realized
    this.</p>
  <p>The Oracle took down his bridle from its peg, and started for the door amid
    a respectful and sympathetic silence, which was only partly broken once by
    the voice of Mitchell, which asked in an awed whisper:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going ter ketch yer horse, Tom?&rdquo; The Oracle nodded, and passed
    on; he spake no word&mdash;he was too full for words.</p>
  <p>Five minutes passed, and then the voice of Mitchell was heard again, uninterrupted
    by the clatter of tinware. It said in impressive tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would not be a bad idea for some of you chaps that camp in the
    bunks along there, to have a look at your things. Scotty&rsquo;s bunk is
    next to Tom&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Scotty shot out of his place as if a snake had hold of his leg, starting
    a plank in the table and upsetting three soup plates. He reached for his
    bunk like a drowning man clutching at a plank, and tore out the bedding.
    Again, Smith hadn&rsquo;t forgot.</p>
  <p>Then followed a general overhaul, and it was found in most cases that Smith
    had remembered. The pent-up reservoir of blasphemy burst forth.</p>
  <p>The Oracle came up with Smith that night at the nearest shanty, and found
    that he had forgotten again, and in several instances, and was forgetting
    some more under the influence of rum and of the flattering interest taken
    in his case by a drunken Bachelor of Arts who happened to be at the pub.
    Tom came in quietly from the rear, and crooked his finger at the shanty-keeper.
    They went apart from the rest, and talked together a while very earnestly.
    Then they secretly examined Smith&rsquo;s swag, the core of which was composed
    of Tom&rsquo;s and his mate&rsquo;s valuables.</p>
  <p>Then The Oracle stirred up Smith&rsquo;s recollections and departed.</p>
  <p>Smith was about again in a couple of weeks. He was damaged somewhat physically,
    but his memory was no longer impaired.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Hungerford"></a>Hungerford</b></h2>
  <p>One of the hungriest cleared roads in New South Wales runs to within a couple
    of miles of Hungerford, and stops there; then you strike through the scrub
    to the town. There is no distant prospect of Hungerford&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
    see the town till you are quite close to it, and then two or three white-washed
    galvanized-iron roofs start out of the mulga.</p>
  <p>They say that a past Ministry commenced to clear the road from Bourke, under
    the impression that Hungerford was an important place, and went on, with
    the blindness peculiar to governments, till they got to within two miles
    of the town. Then they ran short of rum and rations, and sent a man on to
    get them, and make inquiries. The member never came back, and two more were
    sent to find him&mdash;or Hungerford. Three days later the two returned in
    an exhausted condition, and submitted a motion of want-of-confidence, which
    was lost. Then the whole House went on and was lost also. Strange to relate,
    that Government was never missed.</p>
  <p>However, we found Hungerford and camped there for a day. The town is right
    on the Queensland border, and an interprovincial rabbit-proof fence&mdash;with
    rabbits on both sides of it&mdash;runs across the main street.</p>
  <p>This fence is a standing joke with Australian rabbits&mdash;about the only
    joke they have out there, except the memory of Pasteur and poison and inoculation.
    It is amusing to go a little way out of town, about sunset, and watch them
    crack Noah&rsquo;s Ark rabbit jokes about that fence, and burrow under and
    play leap-frog over it till they get tired. One old buck rabbit sat up and
    nearly laughed his ears off at a joke of his own about that fence. He laughed
    so much that he couldn&rsquo;t get away when I reached for him. I could hardly
    eat him for laughing. I never saw a rabbit laugh before; but I&rsquo;ve seen
    a &rsquo;possum do it.</p>
  <p>Hungerford consists of two houses and a humpy in New South Wales, and five
    houses in Queensland. Characteristically enough, both the pubs are in Queensland.
    We got a glass of sour yeast at one and paid sixpence for it&mdash;we had
    asked for English ale.</p>
  <p>The post office is in New South Wales, and the police-barracks in Bananaland.
    The police cannot do anything if there&rsquo;s a row going on across the
    street in New South Wales, except to send to Brisbane and have an extradition
    warrant applied for; and they don&rsquo;t do much if there&rsquo;s a row
    in Queensland. Most of the rows are across the border, where the pubs are.</p>
  <p>At least, I believe that&rsquo;s how it is, though the man who told me might
    have been a liar. Another man said he was a liar, but then <i>he</i> might
    have been a liar himself&mdash;a third person said he was one. I heard that
    there was a fight over it, but the man who told me about the fight might
    not have been telling the truth.</p>
  <p>One part of the town swears at Brisbane when things go wrong, and the other
    part curses Sydney.</p>
  <p>The country looks as though a great ash-heap had been spread out there,
    and mulga scrub and firewood planted&mdash;and neglected. The country looks
    just as bad for a hundred miles round Hungerford, and beyond that it gets
    worse&mdash;a blasted, barren wilderness that doesn&rsquo;t even howl. If
    it howled it would be a relief.</p>
  <p>I believe that Bourke and Wills found Hungerford, and it&rsquo;s a pity
    they did; but, if I ever stand by the graves of the men who first travelled
    through this country, when there were neither roads nor stations, nor tanks,
    nor bores, nor pubs, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take my hat off. There were
    brave men in the land in those days.</p>
  <p>It is said that the explorers gave the district its name chiefly because
    of the hunger they found there, which has remained there ever since. I don&rsquo;t
    know where the &ldquo;ford&rdquo; comes in&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing to
    ford, except in flood-time. Hungerthirst would have been better. The town
    is supposed to be situated on the banks of a river called the Paroo, but
    we saw no water there, except what passed for it in a tank. The goats and
    sheep and dogs and the rest of the population drink there. It is dangerous
    to take too much of that water in a raw state.</p>
  <p>Except in flood-time you couldn&rsquo;t find the bed of the river without
    the aid of a spirit-level and a long straight-edge. There is a Custom-house
    against the fence on the northern side. A pound of tea often costs six shillings
    on that side, and you can get a common lead pencil for fourpence at the rival
    store across the street in the mother province. Also, a small loaf of sour
    bread sells for a shilling at the humpy aforementioned. Only about sixty
    per cent of the sugar will melt.</p>
  <p>We saw one of the storekeepers give a dead-beat swagman five shillings&rsquo;  worth
    of rations to take him on into Queensland. The storekeepers often do this,
    and put it down on the loss side of their books. I hope the recording angel
    listens, and puts it down on the right side of his book.</p>
  <p>We camped on the Queensland side of the fence, and after tea had a yarn
    with an old man who was minding a mixed flock of goats and sheep; and we
    asked him whether he thought Queensland was better than New South Wales,
    or the other way about.</p>
  <p>He scratched the back of his head, and thought a while, and hesitated like
    a stranger who is going to do you a favour at some personal inconvenience.</p>
  <p>At last, with the bored air of a man who has gone through the same performance
    too often before, he stepped deliberately up to the fence and spat over it
    into New South Wales. After which he got leisurely through and spat back
    on Queensland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think of the blanky colonies!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>He gave us time to become sufficiently impressed; then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I was at the Victorian and South Australian border I&rsquo;d
    do the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He let that soak into our minds, and added: &ldquo;And the same with West
    Australia&mdash;and&mdash;and Tasmania.&rdquo; Then he went away.</p>
  <p>The last would have been a long spit&mdash;and he forgot Maoriland.</p>
  <p>We heard afterwards that his name was Clancy and he had that day been offered
    a job droving at &ldquo;twenty-five shillings a week and find your own horse.&rdquo;  Also
    find your own horse feed and tobacco and soap and other luxuries, at station
    prices. Moreover, if you lost your own horse you would have to find another,
    and if that died or went astray you would have to find a third&mdash;or forfeit
    your pay and return on foot. The boss drover agreed to provide flour and
    mutton&mdash;when such things were procurable.</p>
  <p>Consequently, Clancy&rsquo;s unfavourable opinion of the colonies.</p>
  <p>My mate and I sat down on our swags against the fence to talk things over.
    One of us was very deaf. Presently a black tracker went past and looked at
    us, and returned to the pub. Then a trooper in Queensland uniform came along
    and asked us what the trouble was about, and where we came from and were
    going, and where we camped. We said we were discussing private business,
    and he explained that he thought it was a row, and came over to see. Then
    he left us, and later on we saw him sitting with the rest of the population
    on a bench under the hotel veranda. Next morning we rolled up our swags and
    left Hungerford to the north-west.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ACampFireYarn"></a>A Camp-Fire Yarn</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;This girl,&rdquo; said Mitchell, continuing a yarn to his mate, &ldquo;was
    about the ugliest girl I ever saw, except one, and I&rsquo;ll tell you about
    her directly. The old man had a carpenter&rsquo;s shop fixed up in a shed
    at the back of his house, and he used to work there pretty often, and sometimes
    I&rsquo;d come over and yarn with him. One day I was sitting on the end of
    the bench, and the old man was working away, and Mary was standing there
    too, all three of us yarning&mdash;she mostly came poking round where I was
    if I happened to be on the premises&mdash;or at least I thought so&mdash;and
    we got yarning about getting married, and the old cove said he&rsquo;d get
    married again if the old woman died.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>You</i> get married again!&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;Why,
    father, you wouldn&rsquo;t get anyone to marry you&mdash;who&rsquo;d have
    you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I bet I&rsquo;ll get someone
    sooner than you, anyway. You don&rsquo;t seem to be able to get anyone, and
    it&rsquo;s pretty near time you thought of settlin&rsquo; down and gettin&rsquo; married.
    I wish <i>someone</i> would have you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hit her pretty hard there, but it served her right. She got as
    good as she gave. She looked at me and went all colours, and then she went
    back to her washtub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was mighty quiet at tea-time&mdash;she seemed hurt a lot, and
    I began to feel sorry I&rsquo;d laughed at the old man&rsquo;s joke, for
    she was really a good, hard-working girl, and you couldn&rsquo;t help liking
    her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So after tea I went out to her in the kitchen, where she was washing
    up, to try and cheer her up a bit. She&rsquo;d scarcely speak at first, except
    to say  &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo;, and kept her face turned away
    from me; and I could see that she&rsquo;d been crying. I began to feel sorry
    for her and mad at the old man, and I started to comfort her. But I didn&rsquo;t
    go the right way to work about it. I told her that she mustn&rsquo;t take
    any notice of the old cove, as he didn&rsquo;t mean half he said. But she
    seemed to take it harder than ever, and at last I got so sorry for her that
    I told her that <i>I&rsquo;d</i> have her if she&rsquo;d have me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo; asked Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, after a
    pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said she wouldn&rsquo;t have me at any price!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mate laughed, and Mitchell grinned his quiet grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this set me thinking,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I always
    knew I was a dashed ugly cove, and I began to wonder whether any girl would
    really have me; and I kept on it till at last I made up my mind to find out
    and settle the matter for good&mdash;or bad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was another farmer&rsquo;s daughter living close by, and I
    met her pretty often coming home from work, and sometimes I had a yarn with
    her. She was plain, and no mistake: Mary was a Venus alongside of her. She
    had feet like a Lascar, and hands about ten sizes too large for her, and
    a face like that camel&mdash;only red; she walked like a camel, too. She
    looked like a ladder with a dress on, and she didn&rsquo;t know a great A
    from a corner cupboard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one evening I met her at the sliprails, and presently I asked
    her, for a joke, if she&rsquo;d marry me. Mind you, I never wanted to marry <i>her</i>;
    I was only curious to know whether any girl would have me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She turned away her face and seemed to hesitate, and I was just turning
    away and beginning to think I was a dashed hopeless case, when all of a sudden
    she fell up against me and said she&rsquo;d be my wife.... And it wasn&rsquo;t
    her fault that she wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did she do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do! What didn&rsquo;t she do? Next day she went down to our place
    when I was at work, and hugged and kissed mother and the girls all round,
    and cried, and told mother that she&rsquo;d try and be a dutiful daughter
    to her. Good Lord! You should have seen the old woman and the girls when
    I came home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then she let everyone know that Bridget Page was engaged to Jack
    Mitchell, and told her friends that she went down on her knees every night
    and thanked the Lord for getting the love of a good man. Didn&rsquo;t the
    fellows chyack me, though! My sisters were raving mad about it, for their
    chums kept asking them how they liked their new sister, and when it was going
    to come off, and who&rsquo;d be bridesmaids and best man, and whether they
    weren&rsquo;t surprised at their brother Jack&rsquo;s choice; and then I&rsquo;d
    gammon at home that it was all true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last the place got too hot for me. I got sick of dodging that
    girl. I sent a mate of mine to tell her that it was all a joke, and that
    I was already married in secret; but she didn&rsquo;t see it, then I cleared,
    and got a job in Newcastle, but had to leave there when my mates sent me
    the office that she was coming. I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what she is humping
    her swag after me now. In fact, I thought you was her in disguise when I
    set eyes on you first.... You needn&rsquo;t get mad about it; I don&rsquo;t
    mean to say that you&rsquo;re quite as ugly as she was, because I never saw
    a man that was&mdash;or a woman either. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll never ask a woman
    to marry me again unless I&rsquo;m ready to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Mitchell&rsquo;s mate told a yarn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew a case once something like the one you were telling me about;
    the landlady of a hash-house where I was stopping in Albany told me. There
    was a young carpenter staying there, who&rsquo;d run away from Sydney from
    an old maid who wanted to marry him. He&rsquo;d cleared from the church door,
    I believe. He was scarcely more&rsquo;n a boy&mdash;about nineteen&mdash;and
    a soft kind of a fellow, something like you, only good-looking&mdash;that
    is, he was passable. Well, as soon as the woman found out where he&rsquo;d
    gone, she came after him. She turned up at the boarding-house one Saturday
    morning when Bobbie was at work; and the first thing she did was to rent
    a double room from the landlady and buy some cups and saucers to start housekeeping
    with. When Bobbie came home he just gave her one look and gave up the game.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get your dinner, Bobbie,&rsquo; she said, after she&rsquo;d
    slobbered over him a bit, &lsquo;and then get dressed and come with me and
    get married!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was about three times his age, and had a face like that picture
    of a lady over Sappho Smith&rsquo;s letters in the Sydney <i>Bulletin</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Bobbie went with her like a&mdash;like a lamb; never gave a
    kick or tried to clear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;did you ever shear lambs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind. Let me finish the yarn. Bobbie was married; but she wouldn&rsquo;t
    let him out of her sight all that afternoon, and he had to put up with her
    before them all. About bedtime he sneaked out and started along the passage
    to his room that he shared with two or three mates. But she&rsquo;d her eye
    on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bobbie, Bobbie!&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed,&rsquo; said Bobbie. &lsquo;Good night!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bobbie, Bobbie,&rsquo; she says, sharply. &lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t
    our room; <i>this</i> is our room, Bobbie. Come back at once! What do you
    mean, Bobbie? <i>Do you hear me, Bobbie?</i>&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So Bobbie came back, and went in with the scarecrow. Next morning
    she was first at the breakfast table, in a dressing-gown and curl papers.
    And when they were all sitting down Bobbie sneaked in, looking awfully sheepish,
    and sidled for his chair at the other end of the table. But she&rsquo;d her
    eyes on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bobbie, Bobbie!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Come and kiss me,
    Bobbie!&rsquo;&rdquo; And he had to do it in front of them all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I believe she made him a good wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HisCountryAfterAll"></a>His Country-After All</b></h2>
  <p>The Blenheim coach was descending into the valley of the Avetere River&mdash;pronounced
    Aveterry&mdash;from the saddle of Taylor&rsquo;s Pass. Across the river to
    the right, the grey slopes and flats stretched away to the distant sea from
    a range of tussock hills. There was no native bush there; but there were
    several groves of imported timber standing wide apart&mdash;sentinel-like&mdash;seeming
    lonely and striking in their isolation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grand country, New Zealand, eh?&rdquo; said a stout man with a brown
    face, grey beard, and grey eyes, who sat between the driver and another passenger
    on the box.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call this grand country!&rdquo; exclaimed the other
    passenger, who claimed to be, and looked like, a commercial traveller, and
    might have been a professional spieler&mdash;quite possibly both. &ldquo;Why,
    it&rsquo;s about the poorest country in New Zealand! You ought to see some
    of the country in the North Island&mdash;Wairarapa and Napier districts,
    round about Pahiatua. I call this damn poor country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon you wouldn&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;d ever been in Australia&mdash;back
    in New South Wales. The people here don&rsquo;t seem to know what a grand
    country they&rsquo;ve got. You say this is the worst, eh? Well, this would
    make an Australian cockatoo&rsquo;s mouth water&mdash;the worst of New Zealand
    would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always thought Australia was all good country,&rdquo; mused the
    driver&mdash;a flax-stick. &ldquo;I always thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good country!&rdquo; exclaimed the man with the grey beard, in a
    tone of disgust. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only a mongrel desert, except some
    bits round the coast. The worst dried-up and God-forsaken country I was ever
    in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a silence, thoughtful on the driver&rsquo;s part, and aggressive
    on that of the stranger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always thought,&rdquo; said the driver, reflectively, after the
    pause&mdash;&ldquo;I always thought Australia was a good country,&rdquo; and
    he placed his foot on the brake.</p>
  <p>They let him think. The coach descended the natural terraces above the river
    bank, and pulled up at the pub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a native of Australia?&rdquo; said the bagman to
    the grey-beard, as the coach went on again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I am. Anyway, I was born there. That&rsquo;s the
    main thing I&rsquo;ve got against the darned country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long did you stay there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till I got away,&rdquo; said the stranger. Then, after a think, he
    added,  &ldquo;I went away first when I was thirty-five&mdash;went to the
    islands. I swore I&rsquo;d never go back to Australia again; but I did. I
    thought I had a kind of affection for old Sydney. I knocked about the blasted
    country for five or six years, and then I cleared out to &rsquo;Frisco. I
    swore I&rsquo;d never go back again, and I never will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely you&rsquo;ll take a run over and have a look at old Sydney
    and those places, before you go back to America, after getting so near?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the blazes do I want to have a look at the blamed country for?&rdquo;  snapped
    the stranger, who had refreshed considerably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing
    to thank Australia for&mdash;except getting out of it. It&rsquo;s the best
    country to get out of that I was ever in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I only thought you might have had some friends over there,&rdquo;  interposed
    the traveller in an injured tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friends! That&rsquo;s another reason. I wouldn&rsquo;t go back there
    for all the friends and relations since Adam. I had more than quite enough
    of it while I was there. The worst and hardest years of my life were spent
    in Australia. I might have starved there, and did do it half my time. I worked
    harder and got less in my own country in five years than I ever did in any
    other in fifteen&rdquo;&mdash;he was getting mixed&mdash;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
    been in a few since then. No, Australia is the worst country that ever the
    Lord had the sense to forget. I mean to stick to the country that stuck to
    me, when I was starved out of my own dear native land&mdash;and that country
    is the United States of America. What&rsquo;s Australia? A big, thirsty,
    hungry wilderness, with one or two cities for the convenience of foreign
    speculators, and a few collections of humpies, called towns&mdash;also for
    the convenience of foreign speculators; and populated mostly by mongrel sheep,
    and partly by fools, who live like European slaves in the towns, and like
    dingoes in the bush&mdash;who drivel about &lsquo;democracy,&rsquo; and yet
    haven&rsquo;t any more spunk than to graft for a few Cockney dudes that razzle-dazzle
    most of the time in Paris. Why, the Australians haven&rsquo;t even got the
    grit to claim enough of their own money to throw a few dams across their
    watercourses, and so make some of the interior fit to live in. America&rsquo;s
    bad enough, but it was never so small as that.... Bah! The curse of Australia
    is sheep, and the Australian war cry is Baa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the first man I ever heard talk as you&rsquo;ve
    been doing about his own country,&rdquo; said the bagman, getting tired and
    impatient of being sat on all the time. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lives there a man with
    a soul so dead, who never said&mdash;to&mdash;to himself&rsquo;... I forget
    the darned thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to remember it. The man whose soul was dead cleared his throat
    for action, and the driver&mdash;for whom the bagman had shouted twice as
    against the stranger&rsquo;s once&mdash;took the opportunity to observe that
    he always thought a man ought to stick up for his own country.</p>
  <p>The stranger ignored him and opened fire on the bagman. He proceeded to
    prove that that was all rot&mdash;that patriotism was the greatest curse
    on earth; that it had been the cause of all war; that it was the false, ignorant
    sentiment which moved men to slave, starve, and fight for the comfort of
    their sluggish masters; that it was the enemy of universal brotherhood, the
    mother of hatred, murder, and slavery, and that the world would never be
    any better until the deadly poison, called the sentiment of patriotism, had
    been &ldquo;educated&rdquo; out of the stomachs of the people.  &ldquo;Patriotism!&rdquo; he
    exclaimed scornfully. &ldquo;My country! The darned fools; the country never
    belonged to them, but to the speculators, the absentees, land-boomers, swindlers,
    gangs of thieves&mdash;the men the patriotic fools starve and fight for&mdash;their
    masters. Ba-a!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The opposition collapsed.</p>
  <p>The coach had climbed the terraces on the south side of the river, and was
    bowling along on a level stretch of road across the elevated flat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What trees are those?&rdquo; asked the stranger, breaking the aggressive
    silence which followed his unpatriotic argument, and pointing to a grove
    ahead by the roadside. &ldquo;They look as if they&rsquo;ve been planted
    there. There ain&rsquo;t been a forest here surely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re some trees the Government imported,&rdquo; said
    the bagman, whose knowledge on the subject was limited. &ldquo;Our own bush
    won&rsquo;t grow in this soil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it looks as if anything else would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here the stranger sniffed once by accident, and then several times with
    interest.</p>
  <p>It was a warm morning after rain. He fixed his eyes on those trees.</p>
  <p>They didn&rsquo;t look like Australian gums; they tapered to the tops, the
    branches were pretty regular, and the boughs hung in shipshape fashion. There
    was not the Australian heat to twist the branches and turn the leaves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger, still staring and sniffing hard. &ldquo;Why,
    dang me if they ain&rsquo;t (sniff) Australian gums!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the driver, flicking his horses, &ldquo;they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blanky (sniff) blanky old Australian gums!&rdquo; exclaimed the ex-Australian,
    with strange enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not old,&rdquo; said the driver; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
    only young trees. But they say they don&rsquo;t grow like that in Australia&mdash;&rsquo;count
    of the difference in the climate. I always thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the other did not appear to hear him; he kept staring hard at the trees
    they were passing. They had been planted in rows and cross-rows, and were
    coming on grandly.</p>
  <p>There was a rabbit trapper&rsquo;s camp amongst those trees; he had made
    a fire to boil his billy with gum-leaves and twigs, and it was the scent
    of that fire which interested the exile&rsquo;s nose, and brought a wave
    of memories with it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, mate!&rdquo; he shouted suddenly to the rabbit trapper,
    and to the astonishment of his fellow passengers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, mate!&rdquo; The answer came back like an echo&mdash;it
    seemed to him&mdash;from the past.</p>
  <p>Presently he caught sight of a few trees which had evidently been planted
    before the others&mdash;as an experiment, perhaps&mdash;and, somehow, one
    of them had grown after its own erratic native fashion&mdash;gnarled and
    twisted and ragged, and could not be mistaken for anything else but an Australian
    gum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A thunderin&rsquo; old blue-gum!&rdquo; ejaculated the traveller,
    regarding the tree with great interest.</p>
  <p>He screwed his neck to get a last glimpse, and then sat silently smoking
    and gazing straight ahead, as if the past lay before him&mdash;and it <i>was</i> before
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; he said, in explanation of a long meditative silence
    on his part; &ldquo;ah, well&mdash;them saplings&mdash;the smell of them
    gum-leaves set me thinking.&rdquo;  And he thought some more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said a tourist in the coach, presently,
    in a condescending tone, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see much in Australia. The
    bally colonies are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that be damned!&rdquo; snarled the Australian-born&mdash;they
    had finished the second flask of whisky. &ldquo;What do you Britishers know
    about Australia? She&rsquo;s as good as England, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;ll go straight back to the States as soon
    as you&rsquo;ve done your business in Christchurch,&rdquo; said the bagman,
    when near their journey&rsquo;s end they had become confidential.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno. I reckon I&rsquo;ll just take a run over to Australia
    first. There&rsquo;s an old mate of mine in business in Sydney, and I&rsquo;d
    like to have a yarn with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADayOnASelection"></a>A Day On A Selection</b></h2>
  <p>The scene is a small New South Wales western selection, the holder whereof
    is native-English. His wife is native-Irish. Time, Sunday, about 8 a.m. A
    used-up looking woman comes from the slab-and-bark house, turns her face
    towards the hillside, and shrieks:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;T-o-o-m<i>may</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No response, and presently she draws a long breath and screams again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tom</i>m-a-a-y!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A faint echo comes from far up the siding where Tommy&rsquo;s presence is
    vaguely indicated by half a dozen cows moving slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;down
    towards the cow-yard.</p>
  <p>The woman retires. Ten minutes later she comes out again and screams:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tom</i>my!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y-e-e-a-a-s-s!&rdquo; very passionately and shrilly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to bring those cows down to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y-e-e-a-a-s-s-s!&mdash;carn&rsquo;t yer see I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A boy is seen to run wildly along the siding and hurl a missile at a feeding
    cow; the cow runs forward a short distance through the trees, and then stops
    to graze again while the boy stirs up another milker.</p>
  <p>An hour goes by.</p>
  <p>The rising Australian generation is represented by a thin, lanky youth of
    about fifteen. He is milking. The cow-yard is next the house, and is mostly
    ankle-deep in slush. The boy drives a dusty, discouraged-looking cow into
    the bail, and pins her head there; then he gets tackle on to her right hind
    leg, hauls it back, and makes it fast to the fence. There are eleven cows,
    but not one of them can be milked out of the bail&mdash;chiefly because their
    teats are sore. The selector does not know what makes the teats sore, but
    he has an unquestioning faith in a certain ointment, recommended to him by
    a man who knows less about cows than he does himself, which he causes to
    be applied at irregular intervals&mdash;leaving the mode of application to
    the discretion of his son. Meanwhile the teats remain sore.</p>
  <p>Having made the cow fast, the youngster cautiously takes hold of the least
    sore teat, yanks it suddenly, and dodges the cow&rsquo;s hock. When he gets
    enough milk to dip his dirty hands in, he moistens the teats, and things
    go on more smoothly. Now and then he relieves the monotony of his occupation
    by squirting at the eye of a calf which is dozing in the adjacent pen. Other
    times he milks into his mouth. Every time the cow kicks, a burr or a grass-seed
    or a bit of something else falls into the milk, and the boy drowns these
    things with a well-directed stream&mdash;on the principle that what&rsquo;s
    out of sight is out of mind.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the boy sticks his head into the cow&rsquo;s side, hangs on by
    a teat, and dozes, while the bucket, mechanically gripped between his knees,
    sinks lower and lower till it rests on the ground. Likely as not he&rsquo;ll
    doze on until his mother&rsquo;s shrill voice startles him with an inquiry
    as to whether he intends to get that milking done to-day; other times he
    is roused by the plunging of the cow, or knocked over by a calf which has
    broken through a defective panel in the pen. In the latter case the youth
    gets tackle on to the calf, detaches its head from the teat with the heel
    of his boot, and makes it fast somewhere. Sometimes the cow breaks or loosens
    the leg-rope and gets her leg into the bucket and then the youth clings desperately
    to the pail and hopes she&rsquo;ll get her hoof out again without spilling
    the milk. Sometimes she does, more often she doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;it depends
    on the strength of the boy and the pail and on the strategy of the former.
    Anyway, the boy will lam the cow down with a jagged yard shovel, let her
    out, and bail up another.</p>
  <p>When he considers that he has finished milking he lets the cows out with
    their calves and carries the milk down to the dairy, where he has a heated
    argument with his mother, who&mdash;judging from the quantity of milk&mdash;has
    reason to believe that he has slummed some of the milkers. This he indignantly
    denies, telling her she knows very well the cows are going dry.</p>
  <p>The dairy is built of rotten box bark&mdash;though there is plenty of good
    stringy-bark within easy distance&mdash;and the structure looks as if it
    wants to lie down and is only prevented by three crooked props on the leaning
    side; more props will soon be needed in the rear for the dairy shows signs
    of going in that direction. The milk is set in dishes made of kerosene-tins,
    cut in halves, which are placed on bark shelves fitted round against the
    walls. The shelves are not level and the dishes are brought to a comparatively
    horizontal position by means of chips and bits of bark, inserted under the
    lower side. The milk is covered by soiled sheets of old newspapers supported
    on sticks laid across the dishes. This protection is necessary, because the
    box bark in the roof has crumbled away and left fringed holes&mdash;also
    because the fowls roost up there. Sometimes the paper sags, and the cream
    may have to be scraped off an article on dairy farming.</p>
  <p>The selector&rsquo;s wife removes the newspapers, and reveals a thick, yellow
    layer of rich cream, plentifully peppered with dust that has drifted in somehow.
    She runs a forefinger round the edges of the cream to detach it from the
    tin, wipes her finger in her mouth, and skims. If the milk and cream are
    very thick she rolls the cream over like a pancake with her fingers, and
    lifts it out in sections. The thick milk is poured into a slop-bucket, for
    the pigs and calves, the dishes are  &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo;&mdash;by the aid
    of a dipper full of warm water and a rag&mdash;and the wife proceeds to set
    the morning&rsquo;s milk. Tom holds up the doubtful-looking rag that serves
    as a strainer while his mother pours in the milk. Sometimes the boy&rsquo;s
    hands get tired and he lets some of the milk run over, and gets into trouble;
    but it doesn&rsquo;t matter much, for the straining-cloth has several sizable
    holes in the middle.</p>
  <p>The door of the dairy faces the dusty road and is off its hinges and has
    to be propped up. The prop is missing this morning, and Tommy is accused
    of having been seen chasing old Poley with it at an earlier hour. He never
    seed the damn prop, never chased no cow with it, and wants to know what&rsquo;s
    the use of always accusing him. He further complains that he&rsquo;s always
    blamed for everything. The pole is not forthcoming, and so an old dray is
    backed against the door to keep it in position. There is more trouble about
    a cow that is lost, and hasn&rsquo;t been milked for two days. The boy takes
    the cows up to the paddock sliprails and lets the top rail down: the lower
    rail fits rather tightly and some exertion is required to free it, so he
    makes the animals jump that one. Then he &ldquo;poddies&ldquo;&mdash;hand-feeds&mdash;the
    calves which have been weaned too early. He carries the skim-milk to the
    yard in a bucket made out of an oil-drum&mdash;sometimes a kerosene-tin&mdash;seizes
    a calf by the nape of the neck with his left hand, inserts the dirty forefinger
    of his right into its mouth, and shoves its head down into the milk. The
    calf sucks, thinking it has a teat, and pretty soon it butts violently&mdash;as
    calves do to remind their mothers to let down the milk&mdash;and the boy&rsquo;s
    wrist gets barked against the jagged edge of the bucket. He welts that calf
    in the jaw, kicks it in the stomach, tries to smother it with its nose in
    the milk, and finally dismisses it with the assistance of the calf rope and
    a shovel, and gets another. His hand feels sticky and the cleaned finger
    makes it look as if he wore a filthy, greasy glove with the forefinger torn
    off.</p>
  <p>The selector himself is standing against a fence talking to a neighbour.
    His arms rest on the top rail of the fence, his chin rests on his hands,
    his pipe rests between his fingers, and his eyes rest on a white cow that
    is chewing her cud on the opposite side of the fence. The neighbour&rsquo;s
    arms rest on the top rail also, his chin rests on his hands, his pipe rests
    between his fingers, and his eyes rest on the cow. They are talking about
    that cow. They have been talking about her for three hours. She is chewing
    her cud. Her nose is well up and forward, and her eyes are shut. She lets
    her lower jaw fall a little, moves it to one side, lifts it again, and brings
    it back into position with a springing kind of jerk that has almost a visible
    recoil. Then her jaws stay perfectly still for a moment, and you would think
    she had stopped chewing. But she hasn&rsquo;t. Now and again a soft, easy,
    smooth-going swallow passes visibly along her clean, white throat and disappears.
    She chews again, and by and by she loses consciousness and forgets to chew.
    She never opens her eyes. She is young and in good condition; she has had
    enough to eat, the sun is just properly warm for her, and&mdash;well, if
    an animal can be really happy, she ought to be.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00108-images/page062.jpg" width="850" height="563"></p>
  <p>Presently the two men drag themselves away from the fence, fill their pipes,
    and go to have a look at some rows of forked sticks, apparently stuck in
    the ground for some purpose. The selector calls these sticks fruit-trees,
    and he calls the place &ldquo;the orchard.&rdquo; They fool round these wretched
    sticks until dinnertime, when the neighbour says he must be getting home. &ldquo;Stay
    and have some dinner! Man alive! Stay and have some dinner!&rdquo; says the
    selector; and so the friend stays.</p>
  <p>It is a broiling hot day in summer, and the dinner consists of hot roast
    meat, hot baked potatoes, hot cabbage, hot pumpkin, hot peas, and burning-hot
    plum-pudding. The family drinks on an average four cups of tea each per meal.
    The wife takes her place at the head of the table with a broom to keep the
    fowls out, and at short intervals she interrupts the conversation with such
    exclamations as  &ldquo;Shoo! shoo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Tommy, can&rsquo;t you
    see that fowl? Drive it out!&rdquo; The fowls evidently pass a lot of their
    time in the house. They mark the circle described by the broom, and take
    care to keep two or three inches beyond it. Every now and then you see a
    fowl on the dresser amongst the crockery, and there is great concern to get
    it out before it breaks something. While dinner is in progress two steers
    get into the wheat through a broken rail which has been spliced with stringy-bark,
    and a calf or two break into the vineyard. And yet this careless Australian
    selector, who is too shiftless to put up a decent fence, or build a decent
    house and who knows little or nothing about farming, would seem by his conversation
    to have read up all the great social and political questions of the day.
    Here are some fragments of conversation caught at the dinner-table. Present&mdash;the
    selector, the missus, the neighbour, Corney George&mdash;nicknamed &ldquo;Henry
    George&rdquo;&mdash;Tommy, Jacky, and the younger children. The spaces represent
    interruptions by the fowls and children:</p>
  <p>Corney George (continuing conversation): &ldquo;But Henry George says, in  &lsquo;Progress
    and Poverty,&rsquo; he says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus (to the fowls): &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corney: &ldquo;He says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom: &ldquo;Marther, jist speak to this Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus (to Jack): &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t behave yourself, leave the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom [Corney, probably]: &ldquo;He says in Progress and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Neighbour: &ldquo;I think &lsquo;Lookin&rsquo; Backwards&rsquo; is more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo! Tom, can&rsquo;t you see that fowl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;Now I think &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;s Column&rsquo; is more
    likely&mdash;Just look at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;Just look at the French Revolution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corney: &ldquo;Now, Henry George&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom: &ldquo;Marther! I seen a old-man kangaroo up on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shut up! Eat your dinner an&rsquo; hold your tongue. Carn&rsquo;t
    you see someone&rsquo;s speakin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;Just look at the French&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus (to the fowls): &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; (turning suddenly and unexpectedly
    on Jacky): &ldquo;Take your fingers out of the sugar!&mdash;Blast yer! that
    I should say such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Neighbour: &ldquo;But &lsquo;Lookin&rsquo; Backwards&rsquo; is more&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;There you go, Tom! Didn&rsquo;t I say you&rsquo;d spill that
    tea? Go away from the table!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;I think &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;s Column&rsquo; is the only
    natural&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; She loses patience, gets up and fetches
    a young rooster with the flat of the broom, sending him flying into the yard;
    he falls with his head towards the door and starts in again. Later on the
    conversation is about Deeming.</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt the man&rsquo;s mad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Deeming! That Windsor wretch! Why, if I was in the law I&rsquo;d
    have him boiled alive! Don&rsquo;t tell me he didn&rsquo;t know what he was
    doing! Why, I&rsquo;d have him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corney: &ldquo;But, missus, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus (to the fowls): &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ThatThereDogOMine"></a>That There Dog O&rsquo; Mine</b></h2>
  <p>Macquarie the shearer had met with an accident. To tell the truth, he had
    been in a drunken row at a wayside shanty, from which he had escaped with
    three fractured ribs, a cracked head, and various minor abrasions. His dog,
    Tally, had been a sober but savage participator in the drunken row, and had
    escaped with a broken leg. Macquarie afterwards shouldered his swag and staggered
    and struggled along the track ten miles to the Union Town hospital. Lord
    knows how he did it. He didn&rsquo;t exactly know himself. Tally limped behind
    all the way, on three legs.</p>
  <p>The doctors examined the man&rsquo;s injuries and were surprised at his
    endurance. Even doctors are surprised sometimes&mdash;though they don&rsquo;t
    always show it. Of course they would take him in, but they objected to Tally.
    Dogs were not allowed on the premises.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will have to turn that dog out,&rdquo; they said to the shearer,
    as he sat on the edge of a bed.</p>
  <p>Macquarie said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot allow dogs about the place, my man,&rdquo; said the doctor
    in a louder tone, thinking the man was deaf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tie him up in the yard then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He must go out. Dogs are not permitted on the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Macquarie rose slowly to his feet, shut his agony behind his set teeth,
    painfully buttoned his shirt over his hairy chest, took up his waistcoat,
    and staggered to the corner where the swag lay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to let my dog stop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s against the rules. There are no dogs allowed on premises.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stooped and lifted his swag, but the pain was too great, and he leaned
    back against the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, come now! man alive!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, impatiently. &ldquo;You
    must be mad. You know you are not in a fit state to go out. Let the wardsman
    help you to undress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Macquarie. &ldquo;No. If you won&rsquo;t take my
    dog in you don&rsquo;t take me. He&rsquo;s got a broken leg and wants fixing
    up just&mdash;just as much as&mdash;as I do. If I&rsquo;m good enough to
    come in, he&rsquo;s good enough&mdash;and&mdash;and better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused awhile, breathing painfully, and then went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that there old dog of mine has follered me faithful and
    true, these twelve long hard and hungry years. He&rsquo;s about&mdash;about
    the only thing that ever cared whether I lived or fell and rotted on the
    cursed track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rested again; then he continued: &ldquo;That&mdash;that there dog was
    pupped on the track,&rdquo; he said, with a sad sort of a smile. &ldquo;I
    carried him for months in a billy, and afterwards on my swag when he knocked
    up.... And the old slut&mdash;his mother&mdash;she&rsquo;d foller along quite
    contented&mdash;and sniff the billy now and again&mdash;just to see if he
    was all right.... She follered me for God knows how many years. She follered
    me till she was blind&mdash;and for a year after. She follered me till she
    could crawl along through the dust no longer, and&mdash;and then I killed
    her, because I couldn&rsquo;t leave her behind alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rested again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And this here old dog,&rdquo; he continued, touching Tally&rsquo;s
    upturned nose with his knotted fingers, &ldquo;this here old dog has follered
    me for&mdash;for ten years; through floods and droughts, through fair times
    and&mdash;and hard&mdash;mostly hard; and kept me from going mad when I had
    no mate nor money on the lonely track; and watched over me for weeks when
    I was drunk&mdash;drugged and poisoned at the cursed shanties; and saved
    my life more&rsquo;n once, and got kicks and curses very often for thanks;
    and forgave me for it all; and&mdash;and fought for me. He was the only living
    thing that stood up for me against that crawling push of curs when they set
    onter me at the shanty back yonder&mdash;and he left his mark on some of &rsquo;em
    too; and&mdash;and so did I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took another spell.</p>
  <p>Then he drew in his breath, shut his teeth hard, shouldered his swag, stepped
    into the doorway, and faced round again.</p>
  <p>The dog limped out of the corner and looked up anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That there dog,&rdquo; said Macquarie to the hospital staff in general,  &ldquo;is
    a better dog than I&rsquo;m a man&mdash;or you too, it seems&mdash;and a
    better Christian. He&rsquo;s been a better mate to me than I ever was to
    any man&mdash;or any man to me. He&rsquo;s watched over me; kep&rsquo; me
    from getting robbed many a time; fought for me; saved my life and took drunken
    kicks and curses for thanks&mdash;and forgave me. He&rsquo;s been a true,
    straight, honest, and faithful mate to me&mdash;and I ain&rsquo;t going to
    desert him now. I ain&rsquo;t going to kick him out in the road with a broken
    leg. I&mdash;Oh, my God! my back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He groaned and lurched forward, but they caught him, slipped off the swag,
    and laid him on a bed.</p>
  <p>Half an hour later the shearer was comfortably fixed up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my dog!&rdquo; he asked, when he came to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the dog&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the nurse, rather impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    bother. The doctor&rsquo;s setting his leg out in the yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="GoingBlind"></a>Going Blind</b></h2>
  <p>I met him in the Full-and-Plenty Dining Rooms. It was a cheap place in the
    city, with good beds upstairs let at one shilling per night&mdash;&ldquo;Board
    and residence for respectable single men, fifteen shillings per week.&rdquo; I
    was a respectable single man then. I boarded and resided there. I boarded
    at a greasy little table in the greasy little corner under the fluffy little
    staircase in the hot and greasy little dining-room or restaurant downstairs.
    They called it dining-rooms, but it was only one room, and them wasn&rsquo;t
    half enough room in it to work your elbows when the seven little tables and
    forty-nine chairs were occupied. There was not room for an ordinary-sized
    steward to pass up and down between the tables; but our waiter was not an
    ordinary-sized man&mdash;he was a living skeleton in miniature. We handed
    the soup, and the &ldquo;roast beef one,&rdquo; and &ldquo;roast lamb one,&rdquo; &ldquo;corn
    beef and cabbage one,&rdquo; &ldquo;veal and stuffing one,&rdquo;  and the &ldquo;veal
    and pickled pork,&rdquo; one&mdash;or two, or three, as the case might be&mdash;and
    the tea and coffee, and the various kinds of puddings&mdash;we handed them
    over each other, and dodged the drops as well as we could. The very hot and
    very greasy little kitchen was adjacent, and it contained the bathroom and
    other conveniences, behind screens of whitewashed boards.</p>
  <p>I resided upstairs in a room where there were five beds and one wash-stand;
    one candle-stick, with a very short bit of soft yellow candle in it; the
    back of a hair-brush, with about a dozen bristles in it; and half a comb&mdash;the
    big-tooth end&mdash;with nine and a half teeth at irregular distances apart.</p>
  <p>He was a typical bushman, not one of those tall, straight, wiry, brown men
    of the West, but from the old Selection Districts, where many drovers came
    from, and of the old bush school; one of those slight active little fellows
    whom we used to see in cabbage-tree hats, Crimean shirts, strapped trousers,
    and elastic-side boots&mdash;&ldquo;larstins,&rdquo; they called them. They
    could dance well; sing indifferently, and mostly through their noses, the
    old bush songs; play the concertina horribly; and ride like&mdash;like&mdash;well,
    they <i>could</i> ride.</p>
  <p>He seemed as if he had forgotten to grow old and die out with this old colonial
    school to which he belonged. They <i>had</i> careless and forgetful ways
    about them. His name was Jack Gunther, he said, and he&rsquo;d come to Sydney
    to try to get something done to his eyes. He had a portmanteau, a carpet
    bag, some things in a three-bushel bag, and a tin bog. I sat beside him on
    his bed, and struck up an acquaintance, and he told me all about it. First
    he asked me would I mind shifting round to the other side, as he was rather
    deaf in that ear. He&rsquo;d been kicked by a horse, he said, and had been
    a little dull o&rsquo; hearing on that side ever since.</p>
  <p>He was as good as blind. &ldquo;I can see the people near me,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t make out their faces. I can just make out
    the pavement and the houses close at hand, and all the rest is a sort of
    white blur.&rdquo; He looked up: &ldquo;That ceiling is a kind of white,
    ain&rsquo;t it? And this,&rdquo; tapping the wall and putting his nose close
    to it, &ldquo;is a sort of green, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The ceiling might
    have been whiter. The prevalent tints of the wall-paper had originally been
    blue and red, but it was mostly green enough now&mdash;a damp, rotten green;
    but I was ready to swear that the ceiling was snow and that the walls were
    as green as grass if it would have made him feel more comfortable. His sight
    began to get bad about six years before, he said; he didn&rsquo;t take much
    notice of it at first, and then he saw a quack, who made his eyes worse.
    He had already the manner of the blind&mdash;the touch of every finger, and
    even the gentleness in his speech. He had a boy down with him&mdash;a &ldquo;sorter
    cousin of his,&rdquo; and the boy saw him round. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to
    be sending that youngster back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll
    send him home next week. He&rsquo;ll be picking up and learning too much
    down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I happened to know the district he came from, and we would sit by the hour
    and talk about the country, and chaps by the name of this and chaps by the
    name of that&mdash;drovers mostly, whom we had met or had heard of. He asked
    me if I&rsquo;d ever heard of a chap by the name of Joe Scott&mdash;a big
    sandy-complexioned chap, who might be droving; he was his brother, or, at
    least, his half-brother, but he hadn&rsquo;t heard of him for years; he&rsquo;d
    last heard of him at Blackall, in Queensland; he might have gone overland
    to Western Australia with Tyson&rsquo;s cattle to the new country.</p>
  <p>We talked about grubbing and fencing and digging and droving and shearing&mdash;all
    about the bush&mdash;and it all came back to me as we talked. &ldquo;I can
    see it all now,&rdquo;  he said once, in an abstracted tone, seeming to fix
    his helpless eyes on the wall opposite. But he didn&rsquo;t see the dirty
    blind wall, nor the dingy window, nor the skimpy little bed, nor the greasy
    wash-stand; he saw the dark blue ridges in the sunlight, the grassy sidings
    and flats, the creek with clumps of she-oak here and there, the course of
    the willow-fringed river below, the distant peaks and ranges fading away
    into a lighter azure, the granite ridge in the middle distance, and the rocky
    rises, the stringy-bark and the apple-tree flats, the scrubs, and the sunlit
    plains&mdash;and all. I could see it, too&mdash;plainer than ever I did.</p>
  <p>He had done a bit of fencing in his time, and we got talking about timber.
    He didn&rsquo;t believe in having fencing-posts with big butts; he reckoned
    it was a mistake. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the top of the butt
    catches the rain water and makes the post rot quicker. I&rsquo;d back posts
    without any butt at all to last as long or longer than posts with &rsquo;em&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    if the fence is well put up and well rammed.&rdquo;  He had supplied fencing
    stuff, and fenced by contract, and&mdash;well, you can get more posts without
    butts out of a tree than posts with them. He also objected to charring the
    butts. He said it only made more work&mdash;and wasted time&mdash;the butts
    lasted longer without being charred.</p>
  <p>I asked him if he&rsquo;d ever got stringy-bark palings or shingles out
    of mountain ash, and he smiled a smile that did my heart good to see, and
    said he had. He had also got them out of various other kinds of trees.</p>
  <p>We talked about soil and grass, and gold-digging, and many other things
    which came back to one like a revelation as we yarned.</p>
  <p>He had been to the hospital several times. &ldquo;The doctors don&rsquo;t
    say they can cure me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they say they might, be able
    to improve my sight and hearing, but it would take a long time&mdash;anyway,
    the treatment would improve my general health. They know what&rsquo;s the
    matter with my eyes,&rdquo; and he explained it as well as he could.  &ldquo;I
    wish I&rsquo;d seen a good doctor when my eyes first began to get weak; but
    young chaps are always careless over things. It&rsquo;s harder to get cured
    of anything when you&rsquo;re done growing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was always hopeful and cheerful. &ldquo;If the worst comes to the worst,&rdquo;  he
    said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s things I can do where I come from. I might do
    a bit o&rsquo; wool-sorting, for instance. I&rsquo;m a pretty fair expert.
    Or else when they&rsquo;re weeding out I could help. I&rsquo;d just have
    to sit down and they&rsquo;d bring the sheep to me, and I&rsquo;d feel the
    wool and tell them what it was&mdash;being blind improves the feeling, you
    know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had a packet of portraits, but he couldn&rsquo;t make them out very well
    now. They were sort of blurred to him, but I described them and he told me
    who they were. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a girl o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; he said,
    with reference to one&mdash;a jolly, good-looking bush girl. &ldquo;I got
    a letter from her yesterday. I managed to scribble something, but I&rsquo;ll
    get you, if you don&rsquo;t mind, to write something more I want to put in
    on another piece of paper, and address an envelope for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darkness fell quickly upon him now&mdash;or, rather, the &ldquo;sort of
    white blur&rdquo;  increased and closed in. But his hearing was better, he
    said, and he was glad of that and still cheerful. I thought it natural that
    his hearing should improve as he went blind.</p>
  <p>One day he said that he did not think he would bother going to the hospital
    any more. He reckoned he&rsquo;d get back to where he was known. He&rsquo;d
    stayed down too long already, and the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t
    stand it. He was expecting a letter that didn&rsquo;t come. I was away for
    a couple of days, and when I came back he had been shifted out of the room
    and had a bed in an angle of the landing on top of the staircase, with the
    people brushing against him and stumbling over his things all day on their
    way up and down. I felt indignant, thinking that&mdash;the house being full&mdash;the
    boss had taken advantage of the bushman&rsquo;s helplessness and good nature
    to put him there. But he said that he was quite comfortable. &ldquo;I can
    get a whiff of air here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Going in next day I thought for a moment that I had dropped suddenly back
    into the past and into a bush dance, for there was a concertina going upstairs.
    He was sitting on the bed, with his legs crossed, and a new cheap concertina
    on his knee, and his eyes turned to the patch of ceiling as if it were a
    piece of music and he could read it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to knock a few
    tunes into my head,&rdquo; he said, with a brave smile, &ldquo;in case the
    worst comes to the worst.&rdquo; He tried to be cheerful, but seemed worried
    and anxious. The letter hadn&rsquo;t come. I thought of the many blind musicians
    in Sydney, and I thought of the bushman&rsquo;s chance, standing at a corner
    swanking a cheap concertina, and I felt sorry for him.</p>
  <p>I went out with a vague idea of seeing someone about the matter, and getting
    something done for the bushman&mdash;of bringing a little influence to his
    assistance; but I suddenly remembered that my clothes were worn out, my hat
    in a shocking state, my boots burst, and that I owed for a week&rsquo;s board
    and lodging, and was likely to be thrown out at any moment myself; and so
    I was not in a position to go where there was influence.</p>
  <p>When I went back to the restaurant there was a long, gaunt sandy-complexioned
    bushman sitting by Jack&rsquo;s side. Jack introduced him as his brother,
    who had returned unexpectedly to his native district, and had followed him
    to Sydney. The brother was rather short with me at first, and seemed to regard
    the restaurant people&mdash;all of us, in fact&mdash;in the light of spielers
    who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take advantage of Jack&rsquo;s blindness if
    he left him a moment; and he looked ready to knock down the first man who
    stumbled against Jack, or over his luggage&mdash;but that soon wore off.
    Jack was going to stay with Joe at the Coffee Palace for a few weeks, and
    then go back up-country, he told me. He was excited and happy. His brother&rsquo;s
    manner towards him was as if Jack had just lost his wife, or boy or someone
    very dear to him. He would not allow him to do anything for himself, nor
    try to&mdash;not even lace up his boot. He seemed to think that he was thoroughly
    helpless, and when I saw him pack up Jack&rsquo;s things, and help him at
    the table and fix his tie and collar with his great brown hands, which trembled
    all the time with grief and gentleness, and make Jack sit down on the bed
    whilst he got a cab and carried the trap down to it, and take him downstairs
    as if he were made of thin glass, and settle with the landlord&mdash;then
    I knew that Jack was all right.</p>
  <p>We had a drink together&mdash;Joe, Jack, the cabman, and I. Joe was very
    careful to hand Jack the glass, and Jack made joke about it for Joe&rsquo;s
    benefit. He swore he could see a glass yet, and Joe laughed, but looked extra
    troubled the next moment.</p>
  <p>I felt their grips on my hand for five minutes after we parted.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ArvieAspinallsAlarmClock"></a>Arvie Aspinall&rsquo;s Alarm Clock</b></h2>
  <p>In one of these years a paragraph appeared in a daily paper to the effect
    that a constable had discovered a little boy asleep on the steps of Grinder
    Bros&rsquo; factory at four o&rsquo;clock one rainy morning. He awakened
    him, and demanded an explanation.</p>
  <p>The little fellow explained that he worked there, and was frightened of
    being late; he started work at six, and was apparently greatly astonished
    to hear that it was only four. The constable examined a small parcel which
    the frightened child had in his hand. It contained a clean apron and three
    slices of bread and treacle.</p>
  <p>The child further explained that he woke up and thought it was late, and
    didn&rsquo;t like to wake mother and ask her the time &ldquo;because she&rsquo;d
    been washin&rsquo;.&rdquo;  He didn&rsquo;t look at the clock, because they &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
    have one.&rdquo; He volunteered no explanations as to how he expected mother
    to know the time, but, perhaps, like many other mites of his kind, he had
    unbounded faith in the infinitude of a mother&rsquo;s wisdom. His name was
    Arvie Aspinall, please sir, and he lived in Jones&rsquo;s Alley. Father was
    dead.</p>
  <p>A few days later the same paper took great pleasure in stating, in reference
    to that &ldquo;Touching Incident&rdquo; noticed in a recent issue, that a
    benevolent society lady had started a subscription among her friends with
    the object of purchasing an alarm-clock for the little boy found asleep at
    Grinder Bros&rsquo; workshop door.</p>
  <p>Later on, it was mentioned, in connection with the touching incident, that
    the alarm-clock had been bought and delivered to the boy&rsquo;s mother,
    who appeared to be quite overcome with gratitude. It was learned, also, from
    another source, that the last assertion was greatly exaggerated.</p>
  <p>The touching incident was worn out in another paragraph, which left no doubt
    that the benevolent society lady was none other than a charming and accomplished
    daughter of the House of Grinder.</p>
  <p>It was late in the last day of the Easter Holidays, during which Arvie Aspinall
    had lain in bed with a bad cold. He was still what he called &ldquo;croopy.&rdquo;  It
    was about nine o&rsquo;clock, and the business of Jones&rsquo;s Alley was
    in full swing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, mother, I&rsquo;m far better,&rdquo; said Arvie, &ldquo;the
    sugar and vinegar cuts the phlegm, and the both&rsquo;rin&rsquo; cough gits
    out. It got out to such an extent for the next few minutes that he could
    not speak. When he recovered his breath, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better or worse, I&rsquo;ll have to go to work to-morrow. Gimme the
    clock, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you you shall not go! It will be your death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talking, mother; we can&rsquo;t starve&mdash;and&mdash;s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; somebody
    got my place! Gimme the clock, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send one of the children round to say you&rsquo;re ill.
    They&rsquo;ll surely let you off for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use; they won&rsquo;t wait; I know them&mdash;what
    does Grinder Bros care if I&rsquo;m ill? Never mind, mother, I&rsquo;ll rise
    above &rsquo;em all yet. <i>Give me the clock</i>, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave him the clock, and he proceeded to wind it up and set the alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; wrong with the gong,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    gone wrong two nights now, but I&rsquo;ll chance it. I&rsquo;ll set the alarm
    at five, that&rsquo;ll give me time to dress and git there early. I wish
    I hadn&rsquo;t to walk so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused to read some words engraved round the dial:</p>
  <p class="note">Early to bed and early to rise<br>
    Makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise.</p>
  <p>He had read the verse often before, and was much taken with the swing and
    rhythm of it. He had repeated it to himself, over and over again, without
    reference to the sense or philosophy of it. He had never dreamed of doubting
    anything in print&mdash;and this was engraved. But now a new light seemed
    to dawn upon him. He studied the sentence awhile, and then read it aloud
    for the second time. He turned it over in his mind again in silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;I think it lies.&rdquo; She
    placed the clock on the shelf, tucked him into his little bed on the sofa,
    and blew out the light.</p>
  <p>Arvie seemed to sleep, but she lay awake thinking of her troubles. Of her
    husband carried home dead from his work one morning; of her eldest son who
    only came to loaf on her when he was out of jail; of the second son, who
    had feathered his nest in another city, and had no use for her any longer;
    of the next&mdash;poor delicate little Arvie&mdash;struggling manfully to
    help, and wearing his young life out at Grinder Bros when he should be at
    school; of the five helpless younger children asleep in the next room: of
    her hard life&mdash;scrubbing floors from half-past five till eight, and
    then starting her day&rsquo;s work&mdash;washing!&mdash;of having to rear
    her children in the atmosphere of the slums, because she could not afford
    to move and pay a higher rent; and of the rent.</p>
  <p>Arvie commenced to mutter in his sleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get to sleep, Arvie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is
    your throat sore? Can I get anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to sleep,&rdquo; he muttered, dreamily, &ldquo;but
    it won&rsquo;t seem more&rsquo;n a moment before&mdash;before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before what, Arvie?&rdquo; she asked, quickly, fearing that he was
    becoming delirious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before the alarm goes off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>&nbsp;He was talking in his sleep.</i></p>
  <p>She rose gently and put the alarm on two hours. &ldquo;He can rest now,&rdquo;  she
    whispered to herself.</p>
  <p>Presently Arvie sat bolt upright, and said quickly, &ldquo;Mother! I thought
    the alarm went off!&rdquo; Then, without waiting for an answer, he lay down
    as suddenly and slept.</p>
  <p>The rain had cleared away, and a bright, starry dome was over sea and city,
    over slum and villa alike; but little of it could be seen from the hovel
    in Jones&rsquo;s Alley, save a glimpse of the Southern Cross and a few stars
    round it. It was what ladies call a &ldquo;lovely night,&rdquo; as seen from
    the house of Grinder&mdash;&ldquo;Grinderville&rdquo;&mdash;with its moonlit
    terraces and gardens sloping gently to the water, and its windows lit up
    for an Easter ball, and its reception-rooms thronged by its own exclusive
    set, and one of its charming and accomplished daughters melting a select
    party to tears by her pathetic recitation about a little crossing sweeper.</p>
  <p>There <i>was</i> something wrong with the alarm-clock, or else Mrs Aspinall
    had made a mistake, for the gong sounded startlingly in the dead of night.
    She woke with a painful start, and lay still, expecting to hear Arvie get
    up; but he made no sign. She turned a white, frightened face towards the
    sofa where he lay&mdash;the light from the alley&rsquo;s solitary lamp on
    the pavement above shone down through the window, and she saw that he had
    not moved.</p>
  <p>Why didn&rsquo;t the clock wake him? He was such a light sleeper! &ldquo;Arvie!&rdquo;  she
    called; no answer. &ldquo;Arvie!&rdquo; she called again, with a strange
    ring of remonstrance mingling with the terror in her voice. Arvie never answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! my God!&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
  <p>She rose and stood by the sofa. Arvie lay on his back with his arms folded&mdash;a
    favourite sleeping position of his; but his eyes were wide open and staring
    upwards as though they would stare through ceiling and roof to the place
    where God ought to be.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Stragglers"></a>Stragglers</b></h2>
  <p>An oblong hut, walled with blue-grey hardwood slabs, adzed at the ends and
    set horizontally between the round sapling studs; high roof of the eternal
    galvanized iron. A big rubbish heap lies about a yard to the right of the
    door, which opens from the middle of one of the side walls; it might be the
    front or the back wall&mdash;there is nothing to fix it. Two rows of rough
    bunks run round three sides of the interior; and a fire-place occupies one
    end&mdash;the kitchen end. Sleeping, eating, gambling and cooking accommodation
    for thirty men in about eighteen by forty feet.</p>
  <p>The rouseabouts and shearers use the hut in common during shearing. Down
    the centre of the place runs a table made of stakes driven into the ground,
    with cross-pieces supporting a top of half-round slabs set with the flat
    sides up, and affording a few level places for soup-plates; on each side
    are crooked, unbarked poles laid in short forks, to serve as seats. The poles
    are worn smoothest opposite the level places on the table. The floor is littered
    with rubbish&mdash;old wool-bales, newspapers, boots, worn-out shearing pants,
    rough bedding, etc., raked out of the bunks in impatient search for missing
    articles&mdash;signs of a glad and eager departure with cheques when the
    shed last cut out.</p>
  <p>To the west is a dam, holding back a broad, shallow sheet of grey water,
    with dead trees standing in it.</p>
  <p>Further up along this water is a brush shearing-shed, a rough framework
    of poles with a brush roof. This kind of shed has the advantage of being
    cooler than iron. It is not rain-proof, but shearers do not work in rainy
    weather; shearing even slightly damp sheep is considered the surest and quickest
    way to get the worst kind of rheumatism. The floor is covered with rubbish
    from the roof, and here and there lies a rusty pair of shears. A couple of
    dry tar-pots hang by nails in the posts. The &ldquo;board&rdquo; is very
    uneven and must be bad for sweeping. The pens are formed by round, crooked
    stakes driven into the ground in irregular lines, and the whole business
    reminds us of the &ldquo;cubby-house&rdquo; style of architecture of our
    childhood.</p>
  <p>Opposite stands the wool-shed, built entirely of galvanized iron; a blinding
    object to start out of the scrub on a blazing, hot day. God forgive the man
    who invented galvanized iron, and the greed which introduced it into Australia:
    you could not get worse roofing material for a hot country.</p>
  <p>The wool-washing, soap-boiling, and wool-pressing arrangements are further
    up the dam. &ldquo;Government House&rdquo; is a mile away, and is nothing
    better than a bush hut; this station belongs to a company. And the company
    belongs to a bank. And the banks belong to England, mostly.</p>
  <p>Mulga scrub all round, and, in between, patches of reddish sand where the
    grass ought to be.</p>
  <p>It is New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Half a dozen travellers are camping in the hut,
    having a spell. They need it, for there are twenty miles of dry lignum plain
    between here and the government bore to the east; and about eighteen miles
    of heavy, sandy, cleared road north-west to the next water in that direction.
    With one exception, the men do not seem hard up; at least, not as that condition
    is understood by the swagmen of these times. The least lucky one of the lot
    had three weeks&rsquo; work in a shed last season, and there might probably
    be five pounds amongst the whole crowd. They are all shearers, or at least
    they say they are. Some might be only &ldquo;rousers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These men have a kind of stock hope of getting a few stragglers to shear
    somewhere; but their main object is to live till next shearing. In order
    to do this they must tramp for tucker, and trust to the regulation&mdash;and
    partly mythical&mdash;pint of flour, and bit of meat, or tea and sugar, and
    to the goodness of cooks and storekeepers and boundary-riders. You can only
    depend on getting tucker <i>once</i> at one place; then you must tramp on
    to the next. If you cannot get it once you must go short; but there is a
    lot of energy in an empty stomach. If you get an extra supply you may camp
    for a day and have a spell. To live you must walk. To cease walking is to
    die.</p>
  <p>The Exception is an outcast amongst bush outcasts, and looks better fitted
    for Sydney Domain. He lies on the bottom of a galvanized-iron case, with
    a piece of blue blanket for a pillow. He is dressed in a blue cotton jumper,
    a pair of very old and ragged tweed trousers, and one boot and one slipper.
    He found the slipper in the last shed, and the boot in the rubbish-heap here.
    When his own boots gave out he walked a hundred and fifty miles with his
    feet roughly sewn up in pieces of sacking from an old wool-bale. No sign
    of a patch, or an attempt at mending anywhere about his clothes, and that
    is a bad sign; when a swagman leaves off mending or patching his garments,
    his case is about hopeless. The Exception&rsquo;s swag consists of the aforesaid
    bit of blanket rolled up and tied with pieces of rag. He has no water-bag;
    carries his water in a billy; and how he manages without a bag is known only
    to himself. He has read every scrap of print within reach, and now lies on
    his side, with his face to the wall and one arm thrown up over his head;
    the jumper is twisted back, and leaves his skin bare from hip to arm-pit.
    His lower face is brutal, his eyes small and shifty, and ugly straight lines
    run across his low forehead. He says very little, but scowls most of the
    time&mdash;poor devil. He might be, or at least <i>seem</i>, a totally different
    man under more favourable conditions. He is probably a free labourer.</p>
  <p>A very sick jackaroo lies in one of the bunks. A sandy, sawney-looking Bourke
    native takes great interest in this wreck; watches his every movement as
    though he never saw a sick man before. The men lie about in the bunks, or
    the shade of the hut, and rest, and read all the soiled and mutilated scraps
    of literature they can rake out of the rubbish, and sleep, and wake up swimming
    in perspiration, and growl about the heat.</p>
  <p>It <i>is</i> hot, and two shearers&rsquo; cats&mdash;a black and a white
    one&mdash;sit in one of the upper bunks with their little red tongues out,
    panting like dogs. These cats live well during shearing, and take their chances
    the rest of the year&mdash;just as shed rouseabouts have to do. They seem
    glad to see the traveller come; he makes things more homelike. They curl
    and sidle affectionately round the table-legs, and the legs of the men, and
    purr, and carry their masts up, and regard the cooking with feline interest
    and approval, and look as cheerful as cats can&mdash;and as contented. God
    knows how many tired, dusty, and sockless ankles they rub against in their
    time.</p>
  <p>Now and then a man takes his tucker-bags and goes down to the station for
    a bit of flour, or meat, or tea, or sugar, choosing the time when the manager
    is likely to be out on the run. The cook here is a &ldquo;good cook,&rdquo; from
    a traveller&rsquo;s point of view; too good to keep his place long.</p>
  <p>Occasionally someone gets some water in an old kerosene-tin and washes a
    shirt or pair of trousers, and a pair or two of socks&mdash;or foot-rags&mdash;(Prince
    Alfreds they call them). That is, he soaks some of the stiffness out of these
    articles.</p>
  <p>Three times a day the black billies and cloudy nose-bags are placed on the
    table. The men eat in a casual kind of way, as though it were only a custom
    of theirs, a matter of form&mdash;a habit which could be left off if it were
    worth while.</p>
  <p>The Exception is heard to remark to no one in particular that he&rsquo;ll
    give all he has for a square meal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;d get it cheap, begod!&rdquo; says a big Irish
    shearer. &ldquo;Come and have dinner with us; there&rsquo;s plenty there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Exception only eats a few mouthfuls, and his appetite is gone; his
    stomach has become contracted, perhaps.</p>
  <p>The Wreck cannot eat at all, and seems internally disturbed by the sight
    of others eating.</p>
  <p>One of the men is a cook, and this morning he volunteered good-naturedly
    to bake bread for the rest. His mates amuse themselves by chyacking him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s a dirty and slow cook,&rdquo; says one,
    addressing Eternity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says the cook, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be glad to come to
    me for a pint of flour when I&rsquo;m cooking and you&rsquo;re on the track,
    some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sunset. Some of the men sit at the end of the hut to get the full benefit
    of a breeze which comes from the west. A great bank of rain-clouds is rising
    in that direction, but no one says he thinks it will rain; neither does anybody
    think we&rsquo;re going to have some rain. None but the greenest jackaroo
    would venture that risky and foolish observation. Out here, it can look more
    like rain without raining, and continue to do so for a longer time, than
    in most other places.</p>
  <p>The Wreck went down to the station this afternoon to get some medicine and
    bush medical advice. The Bourke sawney helped him to do up his swag; he did
    it with an awed look and manner, as though he thought it a great distinction
    to be allowed to touch the belongings of such a curiosity. It was afterwards
    generally agreed that it was a good idea for the Wreck to go to the station;
    he would get some physic and, a bit of tucker to take him on. &ldquo;For
    they&rsquo;ll give tucker to a sick man sooner than to a chap what&rsquo;s
    all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Exception is rooting about in the rubbish for the other blucher boot.</p>
  <p>The men get a little more sociable, and &ldquo;feel&rdquo; each other to
    find out who&rsquo;s &ldquo;Union,&rdquo; and talk about water, and exchange
    hints as to good tucker-tracks, and discuss the strike, and curse the squatter
    (which is all they have got to curse), and growl about Union leaders, and
    tell lies against each other sociably. There are tally lies; and lies about
    getting tucker by trickery; and long-tramp-with-heavy-swag-and-no-water lies;
    and lies about getting the best of squatters and bosses-over-the-board; and
    droving, fighting, racing, gambling and drinking lies. Lies <i>ad libitum</i>;
    and every true Australian bushman must try his best to tell a bigger out-back
    lie than the last bush-liar.</p>
  <p>Pat is not quite easy in his mind. He found an old pair of pants in the
    scrub this morning, and cannot decide whether they are better than his own,
    or, rather, whether his own are worse&mdash;if that&rsquo;s possible. He
    does not want to increase the weight of his swag unnecessarily by taking
    both pairs. He reckons that the pants were thrown away when the shed cut
    out last, but then they might have been lying out exposed to the weather
    for a longer period. It is rather an important question, for it is very annoying,
    after you&rsquo;ve mended and patched an old pair of pants, to find, when
    a day or two further on the track, that they are more rotten than the pair
    you left behind.</p>
  <p>There is some growling about the water here, and one of the men makes a
    billy of tea. The water is better cooked. Pint-pots and sugar-bags are groped
    out and brought to the kitchen hut, and each man fills his pannikin; the
    Irishman keeps a thumb on the edge of his, so as to know when the pot is
    full, for it is very dark, and there is no more firewood. You soon know this
    way, especially if you are in the habit of pressing lighted tobacco down
    into your pipe with the top of your thumb. The old slush-lamps are all burnt
    out.</p>
  <p>Each man feels for the mouth of his sugar-bag with one hand while he keeps
    the bearings of his pot with the other.</p>
  <p>The Irishman has lost his match-box, and feels for it all over the table
    without success. He stoops down with his hands on his knees, gets the table-top
    on a level with the flicker of firelight, and &ldquo;moons&rdquo; the object,
    as it were.</p>
  <p>Time to turn in. It is very dark inside and bright moonlight without; every
    crack seems like a ghost peering in. Some of the men will roll up their swags
    on the morrow and depart; some will take another day&rsquo;s spell. It is
    all according to the tucker.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheUnionBuriesItsDead"></a>The Union Buries Its Dead</b></h2>
  <p>While out boating one Sunday afternoon on a billabong across the river,
    we saw a young man on horseback driving some horses along the bank. He said
    it was a fine day, and asked if the water was deep there. The joker of our
    party said it was deep enough to drown him, and he laughed and rode farther
    up. We didn&rsquo;t take-much notice of him.</p>
  <p>Next day a funeral gathered at a corner pub and asked each other in to have
    a drink while waiting for the hearse. They passed away some of the time dancing
    jigs to a piano in the bar parlour. They passed away the rest of the time
    skylarking and fighting.</p>
  <p>The defunct was a young Union labourer, about twenty-five, who had been
    drowned the previous day while trying to swim some horses across a billabong
    of the Darling.</p>
  <p>He was almost a stranger in town, and the fact of his having been a Union
    man accounted for the funeral. The police found some Union papers in his
    swag, and called at the General Labourers&rsquo; Union Office for information
    about him. That&rsquo;s how we knew. The secretary had very little information
    to give. The departed was a &ldquo;Roman,&rdquo; and the majority of the
    town were otherwise&mdash;but Unionism is stronger than creed. Liquor, however,
    is stronger than Unionism; and, when the hearse presently arrived, more than
    two-thirds of the funeral were unable to follow.</p>
  <p>The procession numbered fifteen, fourteen souls following the broken shell
    of a soul. Perhaps not one of the fourteen possessed a soul any more than
    the corpse did&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
  <p>Four or five of the funeral, who were boarders at the pub, borrowed a trap
    which the landlord used to carry passengers to and from the railway station.
    They were strangers to us who were on foot, and we to them. We were all strangers
    to the corpse.</p>
  <p>A horseman, who looked like a drover just returned from a big trip, dropped
    into our dusty wake and followed us a few hundred yards, dragging his packhorse
    behind him, but a friend made wild and demonstrative signals from a hotel
    veranda&mdash;hooking at the air in front with his right hand and jobbing
    his left thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the bar&mdash;so the
    drover hauled off and didn&rsquo;t catch up to us any more. He was a stranger
    to the entire show.</p>
  <p>We walked in twos. There were three twos. It was very hot and dusty; the
    heat rushed in fierce dazzling rays across every iron roof and light-coloured
    wall that was turned to the sun. One or two pubs closed respectfully until
    we got past. They closed their bar doors and the patrons went in and out
    through some side or back entrance for a few minutes. Bushmen seldom grumble
    at an inconvenience of this sort, when it is caused by a funeral. They have
    too much respect for the dead.</p>
  <p>On the way to the cemetery we passed three shearers sitting on the shady
    side of a fence. One was drunk&mdash;very drunk. The other two covered their
    right ears with their hats, out of respect for the departed&mdash;whoever
    he might have been&mdash;and one of them kicked the drunk and muttered something
    to him.</p>
  <p>He straightened himself up, stared, and reached helplessly for his hat,
    which he shoved half off and then on again. Then he made a great effort to
    pull himself together&mdash;and succeeded. He stood up, braced his back against
    the fence, knocked off his hat, and remorsefully placed his foot on it&mdash;to
    keep it off his head till the funeral passed.</p>
  <p>A tall, sentimental drover, who walked by my side, cynically quoted Byronic
    verses suitable to the occasion&mdash;to death&mdash;and asked with pathetic
    humour whether we thought the dead man&rsquo;s ticket would be recognized &ldquo;over
    yonder.&rdquo; It was a G.L.U. ticket, and the general opinion was that it
    would be recognized.</p>
  <p>Presently my friend said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember when we were in the boat yesterday, we saw a man driving
    some horses along the bank?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nodded at the hearse and said &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought awhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take any particular notice of him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He
    said something, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; said it was a fine day. You&rsquo;d have taken more notice if
    you&rsquo;d known that he was doomed to die in the hour, and that those were
    the last words he would say to any man in this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said a full voice from the rear. &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;d
    known that, ye&rsquo;d have prolonged the conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We plodded on across the railway line and along the hot, dusty road which
    ran to the cemetery, some of us talking about the accident, and lying about
    the narrow escapes we had had ourselves. Presently someone said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked up and saw a priest standing in the shade of the tree by the cemetery
    gate.</p>
  <p>The hearse was drawn up and the tail-boards were opened. The funeral extinguished
    its right ear with its hat as four men lifted the coffin out and laid it
    over the grave. The priest&mdash;a pale, quiet young fellow&mdash;stood under
    the shade of a sapling which grew at the head of the grave. He took off his
    hat, dropped it carelessly on the ground, and proceeded to business. I noticed
    that one or two heathens winced slightly when the holy water was sprinkled
    on the coffin. The drops quickly evaporated, and the little round black spots
    they left were soon dusted over; but the spots showed, by contrast, the cheapness
    and shabbiness of the cloth with which the coffin was covered. It seemed
    black before; now it looked a dusky grey.</p>
  <p>Just here man&rsquo;s ignorance and vanity made a farce of the funeral.
    A big, bull-necked publican, with heavy, blotchy features, and a supremely
    ignorant expression, picked up the priest&rsquo;s straw hat and held it about
    two inches over the head of his reverence during the whole of the service.
    The father, be it remembered, was standing in the shade. A few shoved their
    hats on and off uneasily, struggling between their disgust for the living
    and their respect for the dead. The hat had a conical crown and a brim sloping
    down all round like a sunshade, and the publican held it with his great red
    claw spread over the crown. To do the priest justice, perhaps he didn&rsquo;t
    notice the incident. A stage priest or parson in the same position might
    have said, &ldquo;Put the hat down, my friend; is not the memory of our departed
    brother worth more than my complexion?&rdquo; A wattle-bark layman might
    have expressed himself in stronger language, none the less to the point.
    But my priest seemed unconscious of what was going on. Besides, the publican
    was a great and important pillar of the church. He couldn&rsquo;t, as an
    ignorant and conceited ass, lose such a good opportunity of asserting his
    faithfulness and importance to his church.</p>
  <p>The grave looked very narrow under the coffin, and I drew a breath of relief
    when the box slid easily down. I saw a coffin get stuck once, at Rookwood,
    and it had to be yanked out with difficulty, and laid on the sods at the
    feet of the heart-broken relations, who howled dismally while the grave-diggers
    widened the hole. But they don&rsquo;t cut contracts so fine in the West.
    Our grave-digger was not altogether bowelless, and, out of respect for that
    human quality described as  &ldquo;feelin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he scraped up some
    light and dusty soil and threw it down to deaden the fall of the clay lumps
    on the coffin. He also tried to steer the first few shovelfuls gently down
    against the end of the grave with the back of the shovel turned outwards,
    but the hard dry Darling River clods rebounded and knocked all the same.
    It didn&rsquo;t matter much&mdash;nothing does. The fall of lumps of clay
    on a stranger&rsquo;s coffin doesn&rsquo;t sound any different from the fall
    of the same things on an ordinary wooden box&mdash;at least I didn&rsquo;t
    notice anything awesome or unusual in the sound; but, perhaps, one of us&mdash;the
    most sensitive&mdash;might have been impressed by being reminded of a burial
    of long ago, when the thump of every sod jolted his heart.</p>
  <p>I have left out the wattle&mdash;because it wasn&rsquo;t there. I have also
    neglected to mention the heart-broken old mate, with his grizzled head bowed
    and great pearly drops streaming down his rugged cheeks. He was absent&mdash;he
    was probably &ldquo;Out Back.&rdquo;  For similar reasons I have omitted
    reference to the suspicious moisture in the eyes of a bearded bush ruffian
    named Bill. Bill failed to turn up, and the only moisture was that which
    was induced by the heat. I have left out the &ldquo;sad Australian sunset&rdquo;  because
    the sun was not going down at the time. The burial took place exactly at
    midday.</p>
  <p>The dead bushman&rsquo;s name was Jim, apparently; but they found no portraits,
    nor locks of hair, nor any love letters, nor anything of that kind in his
    swag&mdash;not even a reference to his mother; only some papers relating
    to Union matters. Most of us didn&rsquo;t know the name till we saw it on
    the coffin; we knew him as &ldquo;that poor chap that got drowned yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So his name&rsquo;s James Tyson,&rdquo; said my drover acquaintance,
    looking at the plate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! Didn&rsquo;t you know that before?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but I knew he was a Union man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It turned out, afterwards, that J.T. wasn&rsquo;t his real name&mdash;only &ldquo;the
    name he went by.&rdquo; Anyhow he was buried by it, and most of the &ldquo;Great
    Australian Dailies&rdquo; have mentioned in their brevity columns that a
    young man named James John Tyson was drowned in a billabong of the Darling
    last Sunday.</p>
  <p>We did hear, later on, what his real name was; but if we ever chance to
    read it in the &ldquo;Missing Friends Column,&rdquo; we shall not be able
    to give any information to heart-broken mother or sister or wife, nor to
    anyone who could let him hear something to his advantage&mdash;for we have
    already forgotten the name.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OnTheEdgeOfAPlain"></a>On The Edge Of A Plain</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d been away from home for eight years,&rdquo; said Mitchell
    to his mate, as they dropped their swags in the mulga shade and sat down. &ldquo;I
    hadn&rsquo;t written a letter&mdash;kept putting it off, and a blundering
    fool of a fellow that got down the day before me told the old folks that
    he&rsquo;d heard I was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here he took a pull at his water-bag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I got home they were all in mourning for me. It was night, and
    the girl that opened the door screamed and fainted away like a shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lit his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother was upstairs howling and moaning in a chair, with all the
    girls boo-hoo-ing round her for company. The old man was sitting in the back
    kitchen crying to himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put his hat down on the ground, dinted in the crown, and poured some
    water into the hollow for his cattle-pup.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00108-images/page098.jpg" width="480" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girls came rushing down. Mother was so pumped out that she couldn&rsquo;t
    get up. They thought at first I was a ghost, and then they all tried to get
    holt of me at once&mdash;nearly smothered me. Look at that pup! You want
    to carry a tank of water on a dry stretch when you&rsquo;ve got a pup that
    drinks as much as two men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He poured a drop more water into the top of his hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, mother screamed and nearly fainted when she saw me. Such a
    picnic you never saw. They kept it up all night. I thought the old cove was
    gone off his chump. The old woman wouldn&rsquo;t let go my hand for three
    mortal hours. Have you got the knife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He cut up some more tobacco.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All next day the house was full of neighbours, and the first to come
    was an old sweetheart of mine; I never thought she cared for me till then.
    Mother and the girls made me swear never to go away any more; and they kept
    watching me, and hardly let me go outside for fear I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get drunk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;you&rsquo;re smart&mdash;for fear I&rsquo;d clear. At last
    I swore on the Bible that I&rsquo;d never leave home while the old folks
    were alive; and then mother seemed easier in her mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rolled the pup over and examined his feet. &ldquo;I expect I&rsquo;ll
    have to carry him a bit&mdash;his feet are sore. Well, he&rsquo;s done pretty
    well this morning, and anyway he won&rsquo;t drink so much when he&rsquo;s
    carried.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You broke your promise about leaving home,&rdquo; said his mate.</p>
  <p>Mitchell stood up, stretched himself, and looked dolefully from his heavy
    swag to the wide, hot, shadeless cotton-bush plain ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he yawned, &ldquo;I stopped at home for a week, and
    then they began to growl because I couldn&rsquo;t get any work to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mate guffawed and Mitchell grinned. They shouldered the swags, with
    the pup on top of Mitchell&rsquo;s, took up their billies and water-bags,
    turned their unshaven faces to the wide, hazy distance, and left the timber
    behind them.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="InADrySeason"></a>In A Dry Season</b></h2>
  <p>Draw a wire fence and a few ragged gums, and add some scattered sheep running
    away from the train. Then you&rsquo;ll have the bush all along the New South
    Wales western line from Bathurst on.</p>
  <p>The railway towns consist of a public house and a general store, with a
    square tank and a school-house on piles in the nearer distance. The tank
    stands at the end of the school and is not many times smaller than the building
    itself. It is safe to call the pub &ldquo;The Railway Hotel,&rdquo; and the
    store &ldquo;The Railway Stores,&rdquo;  with an &ldquo;s.&rdquo; A couple
    of patient, ungroomed hacks are probably standing outside the pub, while
    their masters are inside having a drink&mdash;several drinks. Also it&rsquo;s
    safe to draw a sundowner sitting listlessly on a bench on the veranda, reading
    the <i>Bulletin</i>. The Railway Stores seem to exist only in the shadow
    of the pub, and it is impossible to conceive either as being independent
    of the other. There is sometimes a small, oblong weather-board building&mdash;unpainted,
    and generally leaning in one of the eight possible directions, and perhaps
    with a twist in another&mdash;which, from its half-obliterated sign, seems
    to have started as a rival to the Railway Stores; but the shutters are up
    and the place empty.</p>
  <p>The only town I saw that differed much from the above consisted of a box-bark
    humpy with a clay chimney, and a woman standing at the door throwing out
    the wash-up water.</p>
  <p>By way of variety, the artist might make a water-colour sketch of a fettler&rsquo;s
    tent on the line, with a billy hanging over the fire in front, and three
    fettlers standing round filling their pipes.</p>
  <p>Slop sac suits, red faces, and old-fashioned, flat-brimmed hats, with wire
    round the brims, begin to drop into the train on the other side of Bathurst;
    and here and there a hat with three inches of crape round the crown, which
    perhaps signifies death in the family at some remote date, and perhaps doesn&rsquo;t.
    Sometimes, I believe, it only means grease under the band. I notice that
    when a bushman puts crape round his hat he generally leaves it there till
    the hat wears out, or another friend dies. In the latter case, he buys a
    new piece of crape. This outward sign of bereavement usually has a jolly
    red face beneath it. Death is about the only cheerful thing in the bush.</p>
  <p>We crossed the Macquarie&mdash;a narrow, muddy gutter with a dog swimming
    across, and three goats interested.</p>
  <p>A little farther on we saw the first sundowner. He carried a Royal Alfred,
    and had a billy in one hand and a stick in the other. He was dressed in a
    tail-coat turned yellow, a print shirt, and a pair of moleskin trousers,
    with big square calico patches on the knees; and his old straw hat was covered
    with calico. Suddenly he slipped his swag, dropped his billy, and ran forward,
    boldly flourishing the stick. I thought that he was mad, and was about to
    attack the train, but he wasn&rsquo;t; he was only killing a snake. I didn&rsquo;t
    have time to see whether he cooked the snake or not&mdash;perhaps he only
    thought of Adam.</p>
  <p>Somebody told me that the country was very dry on the other side of Nevertire.
    It is. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to sit down on it any where. The least horrible
    spot in the bush, in a dry season, is where the bush isn&rsquo;t&mdash;where
    it has been cleared away and a green crop is trying to grow. They talk of
    settling people on the land! Better settle <i>in</i> it. I&rsquo;d rather
    settle on the water; at least, until some gigantic system of irrigation is
    perfected in the West.</p>
  <p>Along about Byrock we saw the first shearers. They dress like the unemployed,
    but differ from that body in their looks of independence. They sat on trucks
    and wool-bales and the fence, watching the train, and hailed Bill, and Jim,
    and Tom, and asked how those individuals were getting on.</p>
  <p>Here we came across soft felt hats with straps round the crowns, and full-bearded
    faces under them. Also a splendid-looking black tracker in a masher uniform
    and a pair of Wellington boots.</p>
  <p>One or two square-cuts and stand-up collars struggle dismally through to
    the bitter end. Often a member of the unemployed starts cheerfully out, with
    a letter from the Government Labour Bureau in his pocket, and nothing else.
    He has an idea that the station where he has the job will be within easy
    walking distance of Bourke. Perhaps he thinks there&rsquo;ll be a cart or
    a buggy waiting for him. He travels for a night and day without a bite to
    eat, and, on arrival, he finds that the station is eighty or a hundred miles
    away. Then he has to explain matters to a publican and a coach-driver. God
    bless the publican and the coach-driver! God forgive our social system!</p>
  <p>Native industry was represented at one place along the line by three tiles,
    a chimney-pot, and a length of piping on a slab.</p>
  <p>Somebody said to me, &ldquo;Yer wanter go out back, young man, if yer wanter
    see the country. Yer wanter get away from the line.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
    wanter; I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
  <p>You could go to the brink of eternity so far as Australia is concerned and
    yet meet an animated mummy of a swagman who will talk of going &ldquo;out
    back.&rdquo; Out upon the out-back fiend!</p>
  <p>About Byrock we met the bush liar in all his glory. He was dressed like&mdash;like
    a bush larrikin. His name was Jim. He had been to a ball where some blank
    had &ldquo;touched&rdquo; his blanky overcoat. The overcoat had a cheque
    for ten &ldquo;quid&rdquo; in the pocket. He didn&rsquo;t seem to feel the
    loss much. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s ten quid?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d been everywhere,
    including the Gulf country. He still had three or four sheds to go to. He
    had telegrams in his pocket from half a dozen squatters and supers offering
    him pens on any terms. He didn&rsquo;t give a blank whether he took them
    or no. He thought at first he had the telegrams on him but found that he
    had left them in the pocket of the overcoat aforesaid. He had learned butchering
    in a day. He was a bit of a scrapper himself and talked a lot about the ring.
    At the last station where he shore he gave the super the father of a hiding.
    The super was a big chap, about six-foot-three, and had knocked out Paddy
    Somebody in one round. He worked with a man who shore four hundred sheep
    in nine hours.</p>
  <p>Here a quiet-looking bushman in a corner of the carriage grew restless,
    and presently he opened his mouth and took the liar down in about three minutes.</p>
  <p>At 5.30 we saw a long line of camels moving out across the sunset. There&rsquo;s
    something snaky about camels. They remind me of turtles and goannas.</p>
  <p>Somebody said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Bourke.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HedComeBack"></a>He&rsquo;d Come Back</b></h2>
  <p>The yarn was all lies, I suppose; but it wasn&rsquo;t bad. A city bushman
    told it, of course, and he told it in the travellers&rsquo; hut.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As true&rsquo;s God hears me I never meant to desert her in cold
    blood,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d only been married about two years,
    and we&rsquo;d got along grand together; but times was hard, and I had to
    jump at the first chance of a job, and leave her with her people, an&rsquo; go
    up-country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused and fumbled with his pipe until all ears were brought to bear
    on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was a beauty, and no mistake; she was far too good for me&mdash;I
    often wondered how she came to have a chap like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused again, and the others thought over it&mdash;and wondered too,
    perhaps.</p>
  <p>The joker opened his lips to speak, but altered his mind about it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I travelled up into Queensland, and worked back into Victoria  &rsquo;n&rsquo; South
    Australia, an&rsquo; I wrote home pretty reg&rsquo;lar and sent what money
    I could. Last I got down on to the south-western coast of South Australia&mdash;an&rsquo; there
    I got mixed up with another woman&mdash;you know what that means, boys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sympathetic silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this went on for two years, and then the other woman drove
    me to drink. You know what a woman can do when the devil&rsquo;s in her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sound between a sigh and a groan from Lally Thompson. &ldquo;My oath,&rdquo; he
    said, sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should have made it <i>three</i> years, Jack,&rdquo; interposed
    the joker; &ldquo;you said two years before.&rdquo; But he was suppressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I got free of them both, at last&mdash;drink and the woman,
    I mean; but it took another&mdash;it took a couple of years to pull myself
    straight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here the joker opened his mouth again, but was warmly requested to shut
    it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, chaps, I got thinking. My conscience began to hurt me, and&mdash;and
    hurt worse every day. It nearly drove me to drink again. Ah, boys, a man&mdash;if
    he is a man&mdash;can&rsquo;t expect to wrong a woman and escape scot-free
    in the end.&rdquo; (Sigh from Lally Thompson.) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one
    thing that always comes home to a man, sooner or later&mdash;you know what
    that means, boys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lally Thompson: &ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The joker: &ldquo;Dry up yer crimson oath! What do you know about women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cries of &ldquo;Order!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued the story-teller, &ldquo;I got thinking. I
    heard that my wife had broken her heart when I left her, and that made matters
    worse. I began to feel very bad about it. I felt mean. I felt disgusted with
    myself. I pictured my poor, ill-treated, little wife and children in misery
    and poverty, and my conscience wouldn&rsquo;t let me rest night or day&rdquo;&mdash;(Lally
    Thompson seemed greatly moved)&mdash;&ldquo;so at last I made up my mind
    to be a man, and make&mdash;what&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reparation,&rdquo; suggested the joker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, so I slaved like a nigger for a year or so, got a few pounds
    together and went to find my wife. I found out that she was living in a cottage
    in Burwood, Sydney, and struggling through the winter on what she&rsquo;d
    saved from the money her father left her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got a shave and dressed up quiet and decent. I was older-looking
    and more subdued like, and I&rsquo;d got pretty grey in those few years that
    I&rsquo;d been making a fool of myself; and, some how, I felt rather glad
    about it, because I reckoned she&rsquo;d notice it first thing&mdash;she
    was always quick at noticing things&mdash;and forgive me all the quicker.
    Well, I waylaid the school kids that evening, and found out mine&mdash;a
    little boy and a girl&mdash;and fine youngsters they were. The girl took
    after her mother, and the youngster was the dead spit o&rsquo; me. I gave &rsquo;em
    half a crown each and told them to tell their mother that someone would come
    when the sun went down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bogan Bill nodded approvingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So at sundown I went and knocked at the door. It opened and there
    stood my little wife looking prettier than ever&mdash;only careworn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long, impressive pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, what did she do?&rdquo; asked Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, and what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack sighed and straightened himself up: &ldquo;She said&mdash;she said&mdash;&rsquo;Well,
    so you&rsquo;ve come back.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Painful silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, and what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and so you had!&rdquo; said Tom Moonlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that, Tom,&rdquo; said Jack sadly and wearily&mdash;&ldquo;<i>It
      was the way she said it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lally Thompson rubbed his eyes: &ldquo;And what did you do, Jack?&rdquo; he
    asked gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I stayed for a year, and then I deserted her again&mdash;but meant
    it that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s time to turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnotherOfMitchellsPlansForTheFuture"></a>Another Of Mitchell&rsquo;s Plans For The Future</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get down among the cockies along the Lachlan, or some
    of these rivers,&rdquo; said Mitchell, throwing down his swag beneath a big
    tree. &ldquo;A man stands a better show down there. It&rsquo;s a mistake
    to come out back. I knocked around a good deal down there among the farms.
    Could always get plenty of tucker, and a job if I wanted it. One cocky I
    worked for wanted me to stay with him for good. Sorry I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d
    have been better off now. I was treated more like one of the family, and
    there was a couple of good-looking daughters. One of them was clean gone
    on me. There are some grand girls down that way. I always got on well with
    the girls, because I could play the fiddle and sing a bit. They&rsquo;ll
    be glad to see me when I get back there again, I know. I&rsquo;ll be all
    right&mdash;no more bother about tucker. I&rsquo;ll just let things slide
    as soon as I spot the house. I&rsquo;ll bet my boots the kettle will be boiling,
    and everything in the house will be on the table before I&rsquo;m there twenty
    minutes. And the girls will be running to meet the old cocky when he comes
    riding home at night, and they&rsquo;ll let down the sliprails, and ask him
    to guess  &lsquo;who&rsquo;s up at our place?&rsquo; Yes, I&rsquo;ll find
    a job with some old cocky, with a good-looking daughter or two. I&rsquo;ll
    get on ploughing if I can; that&rsquo;s the sort of work I like; best graft
    about a farm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By and by the cocky&rsquo;ll have a few sheep he wants shorn, and
    one day he&rsquo;ll say to me, &lsquo;Jack, if you hear of a shearer knockin&rsquo; round
    let me know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a few sheep I want shore.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many have you got?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, about fifteen hundred.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what d&rsquo;you think of giving?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, about twenty-five bob a hundred, but if a shearer sticks
    out for thirty, send him up to talk with me. I want to get &rsquo;em shore
    as soon as possible.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;you needn&rsquo;t
    bother; I&rsquo;ll shear your sheep.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;can <i>you</i> shear?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shear? Of course I can! I shore before you were born.&rsquo; It
    won&rsquo;t matter if he&rsquo;s twice as old as me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll shear his sheep and make a few pounds, and he&rsquo;ll
    be glad and all the more eager to keep me on, so&rsquo;s to always have someone
    to shear his sheep. But by and by I&rsquo;ll get tired of stopping in the
    one place and want to be on the move, so I&rsquo;ll tell him I&rsquo;m going
    to leave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what do you want to go for?&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, surprised, &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t
    you satisfied?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m satisfied, but I want a change.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say; &lsquo;stop and
    we&rsquo;ll call it twenty-five bob a week.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell him I&rsquo;m off&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t stay for
    a hundred when I&rsquo;d made up my mind; so, when he sees he can&rsquo;t
    persuade me he&rsquo;ll get a bit stiff and say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what about that there girl? Are you goin&rsquo; to go
    away and leave her like that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what d&rsquo;yer mean?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say. &lsquo;Leave
    her like what?&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t pretend to know what he&rsquo;s driving
    at.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;you know very well what
    I mean. The question is: <i>Are you going to marry the girl or not</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that things are gettin&rsquo; a little warm and that
    I&rsquo;m in a corner, so I&rsquo;ll say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I never thought about it. This is pretty sudden and out
    of the common, isn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t mind marrying the girl if she&rsquo;ll
    have me. Why! I haven&rsquo;t asked her yet!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, look here,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;if you agree
    to marry the girl&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll make you marry her, any road&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    give you that there farm over there and a couple of hundred to start on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ll marry her and settle down and be a cocky myself and
    if you ever happen to be knocking round there hard up, you needn&rsquo;t
    go short of tucker a week or two; but don&rsquo;t come knocking round the
    house when I&rsquo;m not at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Steelman"></a>Steelman</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman was a hard case. If you were married, and settled down, and were
    so unfortunate as to have known Steelman in other days, he would, if in your
    neighbourhood and dead-beat, be sure to look you up. He would find you anywhere,
    no matter what precautions you might take. If he came to your house, he would
    stay to tea without invitation, and if he stayed to tea, he would ask you
    to &ldquo;fix up a shake-down on the floor, old man,&rdquo; and put him up
    for the night; and, if he stopped all night, he&rsquo;d remain&mdash;well,
    until something better turned up.</p>
  <p>There was no shaking off Steelman. He had a way about him which would often
    make it appear as if you had invited him to stay, and pressed him against
    his roving inclination, and were glad to have him round for company, while
    he remained only out of pure goodwill to you. He didn&rsquo;t like to offend
    an old friend by refusing his invitation.</p>
  <p>Steelman knew his men.</p>
  <p>The married victim generally had neither the courage nor the ability to
    turn him out. He was cheerfully blind and deaf to all hints, and if the exasperated
    missus said anything to him straight, he would look shocked, and reply, as
    likely as not:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, my good woman, you must be mad! I&rsquo;m your husband&rsquo;s
    guest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And if she wouldn&rsquo;t cook for him, he&rsquo;d cook for himself. There
    was no choking him off. Few people care to call the police in a case like
    this; and besides, as before remarked, Steelman knew his men. The only way
    to escape from him was to move&mdash;but then, as likely as not, he&rsquo;d
    help pack up and come along with his portmanteau right on top of the last
    load of furniture, and drive you and your wife to the verge of madness by
    the calm style in which he proceeded to superintend the hanging of your pictures.</p>
  <p>Once he quartered himself like this on an old schoolmate of his, named Brown,
    who had got married and steady and settled down. Brown tried all ways to
    get rid of Steelman, but he couldn&rsquo;t do it. One day Brown said to Steelman:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Steely, old man, I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I&rsquo;m afraid
    we won&rsquo;t be able to accommodate you any longer&mdash;to make you comfortable,
    I mean. You see, a sister of the missus is coming down on a visit for a month
    or two, and we ain&rsquo;t got anywhere to put her, except in your room.
    I wish the missus&rsquo;s relations to blazes! I didn&rsquo;t marry the whole
    blessed family; but it seems I&rsquo;ve got to keep them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pause&mdash;very awkward and painful for poor Brown. Discouraging silence
    from Steelman. Brown rested his elbows on his knees, and, with a pathetic
    and appealing movement of his hand across his forehead, he continued desperately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, you see, old man&mdash;you know I&rsquo;d like
    you to stay&mdash;I want you to stay.... It isn&rsquo;t my fault&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    the missus&rsquo;s doings. I&rsquo;ve done my best with her, but I can&rsquo;t
    help it. I&rsquo;ve been more like a master in my own house&mdash;more comfortable&mdash;and
    I&rsquo;ve been better treated since I&rsquo;ve had you to back me up....
    I&rsquo;ll feel mighty lonely, anyway, when you&rsquo;re gone.... But...
    you know... as soon as her sister goes... you know.... &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here poor Brown broke down&mdash;very sorry he had spoken at all; but Steely
    came to the rescue with a ray of light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the little room at the back?&rdquo; he
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we couldn&rsquo;t think of putting you there,&rdquo; said Brown,
    with a last effort; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not fined up; you wouldn&rsquo;t be
    comfortable, and, besides, it&rsquo;s damp, and you&rsquo;d catch your death
    of cold. It was never meant for anything but a wash-house. I&rsquo;m sorry
    I didn&rsquo;t get another room built on to the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; interrupted Steelman, cheerfully. &ldquo;Catch a cold!
    Here I&rsquo;ve been knocking about the country for the last five years&mdash;sleeping
    out in all weathers&mdash;and do you think a little damp is going to hurt
    me? Pooh! What do you take me for? Don&rsquo;t you bother your head about
    it any more, old man; I&rsquo;ll fix up the lumber-room for myself, all right;
    and all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to let me know when the sister-in-law business
    is coming on, and I&rsquo;ll shift out of my room in time for the missus
    to get it ready for her. Here, have you got a bob on you? I&rsquo;ll go out
    and get some beer. A drop&rsquo;ll do you good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if you can make yourself comfortable, I&rsquo;ll be only too
    glad for you to stay,&rdquo; said Brown, wearily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better invite some woman you know to come on a visit,
    and pass her off as your sister,&rdquo; said Brown to his wife, while Steelman
    was gone for the beer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a mess of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Brown said, &ldquo;I knew you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman knew his men.</p>
  <p>But at last Brown reckoned that he could stand it no longer. The thought
    of it made him so wild that he couldn&rsquo;t work. He took a day off to
    get thoroughly worked up in, came home that night full to the chin of indignation
    and Dunedin beer, and tried to kick Steelman out. And Steelman gave him a
    hiding.</p>
  <p>Next morning Steelman was sitting beside Brown&rsquo;s bed with a saucer
    of vinegar, some brown paper, a raw beef-steak, and a bottle of soda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what have you got to say for yourself now, Brown?&rdquo; he
    said, sternly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you jolly well ashamed of yourself to come
    home in the beastly state you did last night, and insult a guest in your
    house, to say nothing of an old friend&mdash;and perhaps the best friend
    you ever had, if you only knew it? Anybody else would have given you in charge
    and got you three months for the assault. You ought to have some consideration
    for your wife and children, and your own character&mdash;even if you haven&rsquo;t
    any for your old mate&rsquo;s feelings. Here, drink this, and let me fix
    you up a bit; the missus has got the breakfast waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="DriftedBack"></a>Drifted Back</b></h2>
  <p>The stranger walked into the corner grocery with the air of one who had
    come back after many years to see someone who would be glad to see him. He
    shed his swag and stood it by the wall with great deliberation; then he rested
    his elbow on the counter, stroked his beard, and grinned quizzically at the
    shopman, who smiled back presently in a puzzled way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said the grocer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice day,&rdquo; said the grocer.</p>
  <p>Pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; tell the old man there&rsquo;s a chap wants to speak to him
    for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old man? What old man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hake, of course&mdash;old Ben Hake! Ain&rsquo;t he in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The grocer smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hake ain&rsquo;t here now. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, he sold out to me ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I&rsquo;ll find him somewhere about town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will. He left Australia when he sold out.
    He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead! Old Ben Hake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You knew him, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The stranger seemed to have lost a great deal of his assurance. He turned
    his side to the counter, hooked his elbow on it, and gazed out through the
    door along Sunset Track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can give me half a pound of nailrod,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet
    tone&mdash;&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose young Hake is in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the whole family went away. I think there&rsquo;s one of the
    sons in business in Sydney now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose the M&rsquo;Lachlans are here yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; they are not. The old people died about five years ago; the sons
    are in Queensland, I think; and both the girls are married and in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!... I see you&rsquo;ve got the railway here now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Six years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Times is changed a lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose you can tell me where I&rsquo;ll
    find old Jimmy Nowlett?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jimmy Nowlett? Jimmy Nowlett? I never heard of the name. What was
    he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he was a bullock-driver. Used to carry from the mountains before
    the railway was made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before my time, perhaps. There&rsquo;s no one of that name round
    here now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!... I don&rsquo;t suppose you knew the Duggans?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. The old man&rsquo;s dead, too, and the family&rsquo;s
    gone away&mdash;Lord knows where. They weren&rsquo;t much loss, to all accounts.
    The sons got into trouble, I b&rsquo;lieve&mdash;went to the bad. They had
    a bad name here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they? Well, they had good hearts&mdash;at least, old Malachi
    Duggan and the eldest son had.... You can give me a couple of pounds of sugar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right. I suppose it&rsquo;s a long time since you were here last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifteen years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose I remind you of anyone you know around
    here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no!&rdquo; said the grocer with a smile. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    say you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll find the Wilds still living in
    the same place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Wilds? Well, no. The old man is dead, too, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and where&rsquo;s Jim? He ain&rsquo;t dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s married and settled down in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you&mdash;&rdquo; said the stranger, hesitatingly; &ldquo;did
    you&mdash;I suppose you knew Mary&mdash;Mary Wild?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary?&rdquo; said the grocer, smilingly. &ldquo;That was my wife&rsquo;s
    maiden name. Would you like to see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no! She mightn&rsquo;t remember me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reached hastily for his swag, and shouldered it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I must be gettin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll camp here over Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; there&rsquo;s nothing to stop here for&mdash;I&rsquo;ll push
    on. I did intend to have a Christmas here&mdash;in fact, I came a long way
    out of my road a-purpose.... I meant to have just one more Christmas with
    old Ben Hake an&rsquo; the rest of the boys&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t know
    as they&rsquo;d moved on so far west. The old bush school is dyin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a smile in his eyes, but his bearded lips twitched a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Things is changed. The old houses is pretty much the same, an&rsquo; the
    old signs want touchin&rsquo; up and paintin&rsquo; jest as had as ever;
    an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s that old palin&rsquo; fence that me an&rsquo; Ben
    Hake an&rsquo; Jimmy Nowlett put up twenty year ago. I&rsquo;ve tramped and
    travelled long ways since then. But things is changed&mdash;at least, people
    is.... Well, I must be goin&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s nothing to keep me here.
    I&rsquo;ll push on and get into my track again. It&rsquo;s cooler travellin&rsquo; in
    the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s been pretty hot to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it has. Well, s&rsquo;long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day. Merry Christmas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? What? Oh, yes! Same to you! S&rsquo;long!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day!&rdquo; He drifted out and away along Sunset Track.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Remailed"></a>Remailed</b></h2>
  <p>There is an old custom prevalent in Australasia&mdash;and other parts, too,
    perhaps, for that matter&mdash;which, we think, deserves to be written up.
    It might not be an &ldquo;honoured&rdquo; custom from a newspaper manager&rsquo;s
    or proprietor&rsquo;s point of view, or from the point of view (if any) occupied
    by the shareholders on the subject; but, nevertheless, it is a time-honoured
    and a good old custom. Perhaps, for several reasons, it was more prevalent
    among diggers than with the comparatively settled bushmen of to-day&mdash;the
    poor, hopeless, wandering swaggy doesn&rsquo;t count in the matter, for he
    has neither the wherewithal nor the opportunity to honour the old custom;
    also his movements are too sadly uncertain to permit of his being honoured
    by it. We refer to the remailing of newspapers and journals from one mate
    to another.</p>
  <p>Bill gets his paper and reads it through conscientiously from beginning
    to end by candle or slush-lamp as he lies on his back in the hut or tent
    with his pipe in his mouth; or, better still, on a Sunday afternoon as he
    reclines on the grass in the shade, in all the glory and comfort of a clean
    pair of moleskins and socks and a clean shirt. And when he has finished reading
    the paper&mdash;if it is not immediately bespoke&mdash;he turns it right
    side out, folds it, and puts it away where he&rsquo;ll know where to find
    it. The paper is generally bespoke in the following manner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at that paper after you, Bill, when yer done
    with it,&rdquo; says Jack.</p>
  <p>And Bill says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I just promised it to Bob. You can get it after him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, when it is finally lent, Bill says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to give that paper back to me when yer done with
    it. Don&rsquo;t let any of those other blanks get holt of it, or the chances
    are I won&rsquo;t set eyes on it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the other blanks get it in their turn after being referred to Bill.  &ldquo;You
    must ask Bill,&rdquo; says Jack to the next blank, &ldquo;I got it from him.&rdquo; And
    when Bill gets his paper back finally&mdash;which is often only after much
    bush grumbling, accusation, recrimination, and denial&mdash;he severely and
    carefully re-arranges the pages, folds the paper, and sticks it away up
    over a rafter, or behind a post or batten, or under his pillow where it will
    safe. He wants that paper to send to Jim.</p>
  <p>Bill is but an indifferent hand at folding, and knows little or nothing
    about wrappers. He folds and re-folds the paper several times and in various
    ways, but the first result is often the best, and is finally adopted. The
    parcel looks more ugly than neat; but Bill puts a weight upon it so that
    it won&rsquo;t fly open, and looks round for a piece of string to tie it
    with. Sometimes he ties it firmly round the middle, sometimes at both ends;
    at other times he runs the string down inside the folds and ties it that
    way, or both ways, or all the ways, so as to be sure it won&rsquo;t come
    undone&mdash;which it doesn&rsquo;t as a rule. If he can&rsquo;t find a piece
    of string long enough, he ties two bits together, and submits the result
    to a rather severe test; and if the string is too thin, or he has to use
    thread, he doubles it. Then he worries round to find out who has got the
    ink, or whether anyone has seen anything of the pen; and when he gets them,
    he writes the address with painful exactitude on the margin of the paper,
    sometimes in two or three places. He has to think a moment before he writes;
    and perhaps he&rsquo;ll scratch the back of his head afterwards with an inky
    finger, and regard the address with a sort of mild, passive surprise. His
    old mate Jim was always plain Jim to him, and nothing else; but, in order
    to reach Jim, this paper has to be addressed to&mdash;</p>
  <p>Mr. James Mitchell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c/o J.&nbsp;  W.&nbsp; Dowell, Esq.,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Munnigrub
  Station&mdash;</p>
  <p>and so on. &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; seems strange&mdash;Bill couldn&rsquo;t
    think of it for the moment&mdash;and so does &ldquo;James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, a week or so later, over on Coolgardie, or away up in northern Queensland,
    or bush-felling down in Maoriland, Jim takes a stroll up to the post office
    after tea on mail night. He doesn&rsquo;t expect any letters, but there might
    be a paper from Bill. Bill generally sends him a newspaper. They seldom write
    to each other, these old mates.</p>
  <p>There were points, of course, upon which Bill and Jim couldn&rsquo;t agree&mdash;subjects
    upon which they argued long and loud and often in the old days; and it sometimes
    happens that Bill comes across an article or a paragraph which agrees with
    and, so to speak, barracks for a pet theory of his as against one held by
    Jim; and Bill marks it with a chuckle and four crosses at the corners&mdash;and
    an extra one at each side perhaps&mdash;and sends it on to Jim; he reckons
    it&rsquo;ll rather corner old Jim. The crosses are not over ornamental nor
    artistic, but very distinct; Jim sees them from the reverse side of the sheet
    first, maybe, and turns it over with interest to see what it is. He grins
    a good-humoured grin as he reads&mdash;poor old Bill is just as thick-headed
    and obstinate as ever&mdash;just as far gone on his old fad. It&rsquo;s rather
    rough on Jim, because he&rsquo;s too far off to argue; but, if he&rsquo;s
    very earnest on the subject, he&rsquo;ll sit down and write, using all his
    old arguments to prove that the man who wrote that rot was a fool. This is
    one of the few things that will make them write to each other. Or else Jim
    will wait till he comes across a paragraph in another paper which barracks
    for his side of the argument, and, in his opinion; rather knocks the stuffing
    out of Bill&rsquo;s man; then he marks it with more and bigger crosses and
    a grin, and sends it along to Bill. They are both democrats&mdash;these old
    mates generally are&mdash;and at times one comes across a stirring article
    or poem, and marks it with approval and sends it along. Or it may be a good
    joke, or the notice of the death of an old mate. What a wave of feeling and
    memories a little par can take through the land!</p>
  <p>Jim is a sinner and a scoffer, and Bill is an earnest, thorough, respectable
    old freethinker, and consequently they often get a <i>War Cry</i> or a tract
    sent inside their exchanges&mdash;somebody puts it in for a joke.</p>
  <p>Long years ago&mdash;long years ago Bill and Jim were sweet on a rose of
    the bush&mdash;or a lily of the goldfields&mdash;call her Lily King. Both
    courted her at the same time, and quarrelled over her&mdash;fought over her,
    perhaps&mdash;and were parted by her for years. But that&rsquo;s all bygones.
    Perhaps she loved Bill, perhaps she loved Jim&mdash;perhaps both; or, maybe,
    she wasn&rsquo;t sure which. Perhaps she loved neither, and was only stringing
    them on. Anyway, she didn&rsquo;t marry either the one or the other. She
    married another man&mdash;call him Jim Smith. And so, in after years, Bill
    comes across a paragraph in a local paper, something like the following:</p>
  <p class="note">On July 10th, at her residence, Eureka Cottage, Ballarat-street,
    Tally Town, the wife of James Smith of twins (boy and girl); all
      three doing well.</p>
  <p>And Bill marks it with a loud chuckle and big crosses, and sends it along
    to Jim. Then Bill sits and thinks and smokes, and thinks till the fire goes
    out, and quite forgets all about putting that necessary patch on his pants.</p>
  <p>And away down on Auckland gum-fields, perhaps, Jim reads the par with a
    grin; then grows serious, and sits and scrapes his gum by the flickering
    firelight in a mechanical manner, and&mdash;thinks. His thoughts are far
    away in the back years&mdash;faint and far, far and faint. For the old, lingering,
    banished pain returns and hurts a man&rsquo;s heart like the false wife who
    comes back again, falls on her knees before him, and holds up her trembling
    arms and pleads with swimming, upturned eyes, which are eloquent with the
    love she felt too late.</p>
  <p>It is supposed to be something to have your work published in an English
    magazine, to have it published in book form, to be flattered by critics and
    reprinted throughout the country press, or even to be cut up well and severely.
    But, after all, now we come to think of it, we would almost as soon see a
    piece of ours marked with big inky crosses in the soiled and crumpled rag
    that Bill or Jim gets sent him by an old mate of his&mdash;the paper that
    goes thousands of miles scrawled all over with smudgy addresses and tied
    with a piece of string.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDroversWife"></a>The Drover&rsquo;s Wife</b></h2>
  <p>The two-roomed house is built of round timber, slabs, and stringy-bark,
    and floored with split slabs. A big bark kitchen standing at one end is larger
    than the house itself, veranda included.</p>
  <p>Bush all round&mdash;bush with no horizon, for the country is flat. No ranges
    in the distance. The bush consists of stunted, rotten native apple-trees.
    No undergrowth. Nothing to relieve the eye save the darker green of a few
    she-oaks which are sighing above the narrow, almost waterless creek. Nineteen
    miles to the nearest sign of civilization&mdash;a shanty on the main road.</p>
  <p>The drover, an ex-squatter, is away with sheep. His wife and children are
    left here alone.</p>
  <p>Four ragged, dried-up-looking children are playing about the house. Suddenly
    one of them yells: &ldquo;Snake! Mother, here&rsquo;s a snake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The gaunt, sun-browned bushwoman dashes from the kitchen, snatches her baby
    from the ground, holds it on her left hip, and reaches for a stick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! gone into the wood-heap!&rdquo; yells the eldest boy&mdash;a
    sharp-faced urchin of eleven. &ldquo;Stop there, mother! I&rsquo;ll have
    him. Stand back! I&rsquo;ll have the beggar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tommy, come here, or you&rsquo;ll be bit. Come here at once when
    I tell you, you little wretch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The youngster comes reluctantly, carrying a stick bigger than himself. Then
    he yells, triumphantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There it goes&mdash;under the house!&rdquo; and darts away with club
    uplifted. At the same time the big, black, yellow-eyed dog-of-all-breeds,
    who has shown the wildest interest in the proceedings, breaks his chain and
    rushes after that snake. He is a moment late, however, and his nose reaches
    the crack in the slabs just as the end of its tail disappears. Almost at
    the same moment the boy&rsquo;s club comes down and skins the aforesaid nose.
    Alligator takes small notice of this, and proceeds to undermine the building;
    but he is subdued after a struggle and chained up. They cannot afford to
    lose him.</p>
  <p>The drover&rsquo;s wife makes the children stand together near the dog-house
    while she watches for the snake. She gets two small dishes of milk and sets
    them down near the wall to tempt it to come out; but an hour goes by and
    it does not show itself.</p>
  <p>It is near sunset, and a thunderstorm is coming. The children must be brought
    inside. She will not take them into the house, for she knows the snake is
    there, and may at any moment come up through a crack in the rough slab floor;
    so she carries several armfuls of firewood into the kitchen, and then takes
    the children there. The kitchen has no floor&mdash;or, rather, an earthen
    one&mdash;called a &ldquo;ground floor&rdquo; in this part of the bush. There
    is a large, roughly-made table in the centre of the place. She brings the
    children in, and makes them get on this table. They are two boys and two
    girls&mdash;mere babies. She gives them some supper, and then, before it
    gets dark, she goes into the house, and snatches up some pillows and bedclothes&mdash;expecting
    to see or lay her hand on the snake any minute. She makes a bed on the kitchen
    table for the children, and sits down beside it to watch all night.</p>
  <p>She has an eye on the corner, and a green sapling club laid in readiness
    on the dresser by her side; also her sewing basket and a copy of the <i>Young
    Ladies&rsquo;  Journal</i>. She has brought the dog into the room.</p>
  <p>Tommy turns in, under protest, but says he&rsquo;ll lie awake all night
    and smash that blinded snake.</p>
  <p>His mother asks him how many times she has told him not to swear.</p>
  <p>He has his club with him under the bedclothes, and Jacky protests:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mummy! Tommy&rsquo;s skinnin&rsquo; me alive wif his club. Make him
    take it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tommy: &ldquo;Shet up, you little&mdash;! D&rsquo;yer want to be bit with
    the snake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jacky shuts up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If yer bit,&rdquo; says Tommy, after a pause, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
    swell up, an&rsquo; smell, an&rsquo; turn red an&rsquo; green an&rsquo; blue
    all over till yer bust. Won&rsquo;t he, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, don&rsquo;t frighten the child. Go to sleep,&rdquo; she
    says.</p>
  <p>The two younger children go to sleep, and now and then Jacky complains of
    being &ldquo;skeezed.&rdquo; More room is made for him. Presently Tommy says: &ldquo;Mother!
    listen to them (adjective) little &rsquo;possums. I&rsquo;d like to screw their
    blanky necks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Jacky protests drowsily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t hurt us, the little blanks!&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Mother: &ldquo;There, I told you you&rsquo;d teach Jacky to swear.&rdquo; But
    the remark makes her smile. Jacky goes to sleep. Presently Tommy asks:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother! Do you think they&rsquo;ll ever extricate the (adjective)
    kangaroo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord! How am I to know, child? Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you wake me if the snake comes out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Near midnight. The children are all asleep and she sits there still, sewing
    and reading by turns. From time to time she glances round the floor and wall-plate,
    and, whenever she hears a noise, she reaches for the stick. The thunderstorm
    comes on, and the wind, rushing through the cracks in the slab wall, threatens
    to blow out her candle. She places it on a sheltered part of the dresser
    and fixes up a newspaper to protect it. At every flash of lightning, the
    cracks between the slabs gleam like polished silver. The thunder rolls, and
    the rain comes down in torrents.</p>
  <p>Alligator lies at full length on the floor, with his eyes turned towards
    the partition. She knows by this that the snake is there. There are large
    cracks in that wall opening under the floor of the dwelling-house.</p>
  <p>She is not a coward, but recent events have shaken her nerves. A little
    son of her brother-in-law was lately bitten by a snake, and died. Besides,
    she has not heard from her husband for six months, and is anxious about him.</p>
  <p>He was a drover, and started squatting here when they were married. The
    drought of 18&mdash; ruined him. He had to sacrifice the remnant of his flock
    and go droving again. He intends to move his family into the nearest town
    when he comes back, and, in the meantime, his brother, who keeps a shanty
    on the main road, comes over about once a month with provisions. The wife
    has still a couple of cows, one horse, and a few sheep. The brother-in-law
    kills one of the latter occasionally, gives her what she needs of it, and
    takes the rest in return for other provisions. She is used to being left
    alone. She once lived like this for eighteen months. As a girl she built
    the usual castles in the air; but all her girlish hopes and aspirations have
    long been dead. She finds all the excitement and recreation she needs in
    the <i>Young Ladies&rsquo; Journal</i>, and Heaven help her! takes a pleasure
    in the fashion-plates.</p>
  <p>Her husband is an Australian, and so is she. He is careless, but a good
    enough husband. If he had the means he would take her to the city and keep
    her there like a princess. They are used to being apart, or at least she
    is. &ldquo;No use fretting,&rdquo; she says. He may forget sometimes that
    he is married; but if he has a good cheque when he comes back he will give
    most of it to her. When he had money he took her to the city several times&mdash;hired
    a railway sleeping compartment, and put up at the best hotels. He also bought
    her a buggy, but they had to sacrifice that along with the rest.</p>
  <p>The last two children were born in the bush&mdash;one while her husband
    was bringing a drunken doctor, by force, to attend to her. She was alone
    on this occasion, and very weak. She had been ill with a fever. She prayed
    to God to send her assistance. God sent Black Mary&mdash;the &ldquo;whitest&rdquo; gin
    in all the land. Or, at least, God sent King Jimmy first, and he sent Black
    Mary. He put his black face round the door post, took in the situation at
    a glance, and said cheerfully: &ldquo;All right, missus&mdash;I bring my
    old woman, she down alonga creek.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One of the children died while she was here alone. She rode nineteen miles
    for assistance, carrying the dead child.</p>
  <p>It must be near one or two o&rsquo;clock. The fire is burning low. Alligator
    lies with his head resting on his paws, and watches the wall. He is not a
    very beautiful dog, and the light shows numerous old wounds where the hair
    will not grow. He is afraid of nothing on the face of the earth or under
    it. He will tackle a bullock as readily as he will tackle a flea. He hates
    all other dogs&mdash;except kangaroo-dogs&mdash;and has a marked dislike
    to friends or relations of the family. They seldom call, however. He sometimes
    makes friends with strangers. He hates snakes and has killed many, but he
    will be bitten some day and die; most snake-dogs end that way.</p>
  <p>Now and then the bushwoman lays down her work and watches, and listens,
    and thinks. She thinks of things in her own life, for there is little else
    to think about.</p>
  <p>The rain will make the grass grow, and this reminds her how she fought a
    bush-fire once while her husband was away. The grass was long, and very dry,
    and the fire threatened to burn her out. She put on an old pair of her husband&rsquo;s
    trousers and beat out the flames with a green bough, till great drops of
    sooty perspiration stood out on her forehead and ran in streaks down her
    blackened arms. The sight of his mother in trousers greatly amused Tommy,
    who worked like a little hero by her side, but the terrified baby howled
    lustily for his &ldquo;mummy.&rdquo; The fire would have mastered her but
    for four excited bushmen who arrived in the nick of time. It was a mixed-up
    affair all round; when she went to take up the baby he screamed and struggled
    convulsively, thinking it was a &ldquo;blackman;&rdquo; and Alligator, trusting
    more to the child&rsquo;s sense than his own instinct, charged furiously,
    and (being old and slightly deaf) did not in his excitement at first recognize
    his mistress&rsquo;s voice, but continued to hang on to the moleskins until
    choked off by Tommy with a saddle-strap. The dog&rsquo;s sorrow for his blunder,
    and his anxiety to let it be known that it was all a mistake, was as evident
    as his ragged tail and a twelve-inch grin could make it. It was a glorious
    time for the boys; a day to look back to, and talk about, and laugh over
    for many years.</p>
  <p>She thinks how she fought a flood during her husband&rsquo;s absence. She
    stood for hours in the drenching downpour, and dug an overflow gutter to
    save the dam across the creek. But she could not save it. There are things
    that a bushwoman can not do. Next morning the dam was broken, and her heart
    was nearly broken too, for she thought how her husband would feel when he
    came home and saw the result of years of labour swept away. She cried then.</p>
  <p>She also fought the pleuro-pneumonia&mdash;dosed and bled the few remaining
    cattle, and wept again when her two best cows died.</p>
  <p>Again, she fought a mad bullock that besieged the house for a day. She made
    bullets and fired at him through cracks in the slabs with an old shot-gun.
    He was dead in the morning. She skinned him and got seventeen-and-sixpence
    for the hide.</p>
  <p>She also fights the crows and eagles that have designs on her chickens.
    Her plan of campaign is very original. The children cry &ldquo;Crows, mother!&rdquo; and
    she rushes out and aims a broomstick at the birds as though it were a gun,
    and says  &ldquo;Bung!&rdquo; The crows leave in a hurry; they are cunning,
    but a woman&rsquo;s cunning is greater.</p>
  <p>Occasionally a bushman in the horrors, or a villainous-looking sundowner,
    comes and nearly scares the life out of her. She generally tells the suspicious-looking
    stranger that her husband and two sons are at work below the dam, or over
    at the yard, for he always cunningly inquires for the boss.</p>
  <p>Only last week a gallows-faced swagman&mdash;having satisfied himself that
    there were no men on the place&mdash;threw his swag down on the veranda,
    and demanded tucker. She gave him something to eat; then he expressed his
    intention of staying for the night. It was sundown then. She got a batten
    from the sofa, loosened the dog, and confronted the stranger, holding the
    batten in one hand and the dog&rsquo;s collar with the other. &ldquo;Now
    you go!&rdquo; she said. He looked at her and at the dog, said &ldquo;All
    right, mum,&rdquo; in a cringing tone, and left. She was a determined-looking
    woman, and Alligator&rsquo;s yellow eyes glared unpleasantly&mdash;besides,
    the dog&rsquo;s chawing-up apparatus greatly resembled that of the reptile
    he was named after.</p>
  <p>She has few pleasures to think of as she sits here alone by the fire, on
    guard against a snake. All days are much the same to her; but on Sunday afternoon
    she dresses herself, tidies the children, smartens up baby, and goes for
    a lonely walk along the bush-track, pushing an old perambulator in front
    of her. She does this every Sunday. She takes as much care to make herself
    and the children look smart as she would if she were going to do the block
    in the city. There is nothing to see, however, and not a soul to meet. You
    might walk for twenty miles along this track without being able to fix a
    point in your mind, unless you are a bushman. This is because of the everlasting,
    maddening sameness of the stunted trees&mdash;that monotony which makes a
    man long to break away and travel as far as trains can go, and sail as far
    as ship can sail&mdash;and farther.</p>
  <p>But this bushwoman is used to the loneliness of it. As a girl-wife she hated
    it, but now she would feel strange away from it.</p>
  <p>She is glad when her husband returns, but she does not gush or make a fuss
    about it. She gets him something good to eat, and tidies up the children.</p>
  <p>She seems contented with her lot. She loves her children, but has no time
    to show it. She seems harsh to them. Her surroundings are not favourable
    to the development of the &ldquo;womanly&rdquo; or sentimental side of nature.</p>
  <p>It must be near morning now; but the clock is in the dwellinghouse. Her
    candle is nearly done; she forgot that she was out of candles. Some more
    wood must be got to keep the fire up, and so she shuts the dog inside and
    hurries round to the woodheap. The rain has cleared off. She seizes a stick,
    pulls it out, and&mdash;crash! the whole pile collapses.</p>
  <p>Yesterday she bargained with a stray blackfellow to bring her some wood,
    and while he was at work she went in search of a missing cow. She was absent
    an hour or so, and the native black made good use of his time. On her return
    she was so astonished to see a good heap of wood by the chimney, that she
    gave him an extra fig of tobacco, and praised him for not being lazy. He
    thanked her, and left with head erect and chest well out. He was the last
    of his tribe and a King; but he had built that wood-heap hollow.</p>
  <p>She is hurt now, and tears spring to her eyes as she sits down again by
    the table. She takes up a handkerchief to wipe the tears away, but pokes
    her eyes with her bare fingers instead. The handkerchief is full of holes,
    and she finds that she has put her thumb through one, and her forefinger
    through another.</p>
  <p>This makes her laugh, to the surprise of the dog. She has a keen, very keen,
    sense of the ridiculous; and some time or other she will amuse bushmen with
    the story.</p>
  <p>She had been amused before like that. One day she sat down &ldquo;to have
    a good cry,&rdquo; as she said&mdash;and the old cat rubbed against her dress
    and &ldquo;cried too.&rdquo;  Then she had to laugh.</p>
  <p>It must be near daylight now. The room is very close and hot because of
    the fire. Alligator still watches the wall from time to time. Suddenly he
    becomes greatly interested; he draws himself a few inches nearer the partition,
    and a thrill runs through his body. The hair on the back of his neck begins
    to bristle, and the battle-light is in his yellow eyes. She knows what this
    means, and lays her hand on the stick. The lower end of one of the partition
    slabs has a large crack on both sides. An evil pair of small, bright bead-like
    eyes glisten at one of these holes. The snake&mdash;a black one&mdash;comes
    slowly out, about a foot, and moves its head up and down. The dog lies still,
    and the woman sits as one fascinated. The snake comes out a foot farther.
    She lifts her stick, and the reptile, as though suddenly aware of danger,
    sticks his head in through the crack on the other side of the slab, and hurries
    to get his tail round after him. Alligator springs, and his jaws come together
    with a snap. He misses, for his nose is large, and the snake&rsquo;s body
    close down in the angle formed by the slabs and the floor. He snaps again
    as the tail comes round. He has the snake now, and tugs it out eighteen inches.
    Thud, thud comes the woman&rsquo;s club on the ground. Alligator pulls again.
    Thud, thud. Alligator gives another pull and he has the snake out&mdash;a
    black brute, five feet long. The head rises to dart about, but the dog has
    the enemy close to the neck. He is a big, heavy dog, but quick as a terrier.
    He shakes the snake as though he felt the original curse in common with mankind.
    The eldest boy wakes up, seizes his stick, and tries to get out of bed, but
    his mother forces him back with a grip of iron. Thud, thud&mdash;the snake&rsquo;s
    back is broken in several places. Thud, thud&mdash;its head is crushed, and
    Alligator&rsquo;s nose skinned again.</p>
  <p>She lifts the mangled reptile on the point of her stick, carries it to the
    fire, and throws it in; then piles on the wood and watches the snake burn.
    The boy and dog watch too. She lays her hand on the dog&rsquo;s head, and
    all the fierce, angry light dies out of his yellow eyes. The younger children
    are quieted, and presently go to sleep. The dirty-legged boy stands for a
    moment in his shirt, watching the fire. Presently he looks up at her, sees
    the tears in her eyes, and, throwing his arms round her neck exclaims:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother, I won&rsquo;t never go drovin&rsquo;; blarst me if I do!&rdquo; And
    she hugs him to her worn-out breast and kisses him; and they sit thus together
    while the sickly daylight breaks over the bush.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00108-images/page138.jpg" width="484" height="750"></p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellDoesntBelieveInTheSack"></a>Mitchell Doesn&rsquo;t Believe In The Sack</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;If ever I do get a job again,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    stick to it while there&rsquo;s a hand&rsquo;s turn of work to do, and put
    a few pounds together. I won&rsquo;t be the fool I always was. If I&rsquo;d
    had sense a couple of years ago, I wouldn&rsquo;t be tramping through this
    damned sand and mulga now. I&rsquo;ll get a job on a station, or at some
    toff&rsquo;s house, knocking about the stables and garden, and I&rsquo;ll
    make up my mind to settle down to graft for four or five years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But supposing you git the sack?&rdquo; said his mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it. Only for taking the sack I wouldn&rsquo;t
    be hard up to-day. The boss might come round and say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t want you after this week, Mitchell. I haven&rsquo;t
    got any more work for you to do. Come up and see me at the office presently.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll go up and get my money; but I&rsquo;ll be pottering
    round as usual on Monday, and come up to the kitchen for my breakfast. Some
    time in the day the boss&rsquo;ll be knocking round and see me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Mitchell,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;I thought you
    was gone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I was going,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say. &lsquo;Who
    told you that&mdash;or what made you think so?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought I told you on Saturday that I wouldn&rsquo;t want
    you any more,&rsquo;  he&rsquo;ll say, a bit short. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t
    got enough work to keep a man going; I told you that; I thought you understood. <i>Didn&rsquo;t
    I give you the sack on Saturday</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use;&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;that sort
    of thing&rsquo;s played out. I&rsquo;ve been had too often that way; I&rsquo;ve
    been sacked once too often. Taking the sack&rsquo;s been the cause of all
    my trouble; I don&rsquo;t believe in it. If I&rsquo;d never taken the sack
    I&rsquo;d have been a rich man to-day; it might be all very well for horses,
    but it doesn&rsquo;t suit me; it doesn&rsquo;t hurt you, but it hurts me.
    I made up my mind that when I got a place to suit me, I&rsquo;d stick in
    it. I&rsquo;m comfortable here and satisfied, and you&rsquo;ve had no cause
    to find fault with me. It&rsquo;s no use you trying to sack me, because I
    won&rsquo;t take it. I&rsquo;ve been there before, and you might as well
    try to catch an old bird with chaff.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t pay you, and you&rsquo;d better be off,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll
    say, trying not to grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind the money,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;the bit
    of tucker won&rsquo;t cost you anything, and I&rsquo;ll find something to
    do round the house till you have some more work. I won&rsquo;t ask you for
    anything, and, surely to God I&rsquo;ll find enough to do to pay for my grub!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll potter round and take things easy and call up at the
    kitchen as usual at meal times, and by and by the boss&rsquo;ll think to
    himself: &lsquo;Well, if I&rsquo;ve got to feed this chap I might as well
    get some work out of him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;ll find me, something regular to do&mdash;a bit of fencing,
    or carpentering, or painting, or something, and then I&rsquo;ll begin to
    call up for my stuff again, as usual.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ShootingTheMoon"></a>Shooting The Moon</b></h2>
  <p>We lay in camp in the fringe of the mulga, and watched the big, red, smoky,
    rising moon out on the edge of the misty plain, and smoked and thought together
    sociably. Our nose-bags were nice and heavy, and we still had about a pound
    of nail-rod between us.</p>
  <p>The moon reminded my mate, Jack Mitchell, of something&mdash;anything reminded
    him of something, in fact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever notice,&rdquo; said Jack, in a lazy tone, just as if
    he didn&rsquo;t want to tell a yarn&mdash;&ldquo;Did you ever notice that
    people always shoot the moon when there&rsquo;s no moon? Have you got the
    matches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lit up; he was always lighting up when he was reminded of something.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This reminds me&mdash;Have you got the knife? My pipe&rsquo;s stuffed
    up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He dug it out, loaded afresh, and lit up again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember once, at a pub I was staying at, I had to leave without
    saying good-bye to the landlord. I didn&rsquo;t know him very well at that
    time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My room was upstairs at the back, with the window opening on to the
    backyard. I always carried a bit of clothes-line in my swag or portmanteau
    those times. I travelled along with a portmanteau those times. I carried
    the rope in case of accident, or in case of fire, to lower my things out
    of the window&mdash;or hang myself, maybe, if things got too bad. No, now
    I come to think of it, I carried a revolver for that, and it was the only
    thing I never pawned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To hang yourself with?&rdquo; asked the mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you&rsquo;re very smart,&rdquo; snapped Mitchell; &ldquo;never
    mind&mdash;. This reminds me that I got a chap at a pub to pawn my last
    suit, while I stopped inside and waited for an old mate to send me a pound;
    but I kept the shooter, and if he hadn&rsquo;t sent it I&rsquo;d have been
    the late John Mitchell long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And sometimes you lower&rsquo;d out when there wasn&rsquo;t a fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that will pass; you&rsquo;re improving in the funny business.
    But about the yarn. There was two beds in my room at the pub, where I had
    to go away without shouting for the boss, and, as it happened, there was
    a strange chap sleeping in the other bed that night, and, just as I raised
    the window and was going to lower my bag out, he woke up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo; I said, shaking my fist at him, like
    that, &lsquo;if you say a word, I&rsquo;ll stoush yer!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;well, you needn&rsquo;t be in
    such a sweat to jump down a man&rsquo;s throat. I&rsquo;ve got my swag under
    the bed, and I was just going to ask you for the loan of the rope when you&rsquo;re
    done with it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, we chummed. His name was Tom&mdash;Tom&mdash;something, I forget
    the other name, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Have you got the matches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He wasted three matches, and continued&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a lot of old galvanized iron lying about under the window,
    and I was frightened the swag would make a noise; anyway, I&rsquo;d have
    to drop the rope, and that was sure to make a noise. So we agreed for one
    of us to go down and land the swag. If we were seen going down without the
    swags it didn&rsquo;t matter, for we could say we wanted to go out in the
    yard for something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you had the swag you might pretend you were walking in your sleep,&rdquo;  I
    suggested, for the want of something funnier to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and get woke up with a black eye.
    Bushies don&rsquo;t generally carry their swags out of pubs in their sleep,
    or walk neither; it&rsquo;s only city swells who do that. Where&rsquo;s the
    blessed matches?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Tom agreed to go, and presently I saw a shadow under the window,
    and lowered away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right?&rsquo; I asked in a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rdquo; whispered the shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I lowered the other swag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; said the shadow, and just then the moon
    came out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says the shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t all right. It was the landlord himself!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems he got up and went out to the back in the night, and just
    happened to be coming in when my mate Tom was sneaking out of the back door.
    He saw Tom, and Tom saw him, and smoked through a hole in the palings into
    the scrub. The boss looked up at the window, and dropped to it. I went down,
    funky enough, I can tell you, and faced him. He said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, mate, why didn&rsquo;t you come straight to me,
    and tell me how you was fixed, instead of sneaking round the trouble in that
    fashion? There&rsquo;s no occasion for it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I felt mean at once, but I said: &lsquo;Well, you see, we didn&rsquo;t
    know you, boss.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So it seems. Well, I didn&rsquo;t think of that. Anyway, call
    up your mate and come and have a drink; we&rsquo;ll talk over it afterwards.&rsquo; So
    I called Tom. &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; I shouted. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the boss kept us a couple of days, and then gave us as much tucker
    as we could carry, and a drop of stuff and a few bob to go on the track again
    with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he was white, any road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I knew him well after that, and only heard one man say a word
    against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you stoush him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I was going to, but Tom wouldn&rsquo;t let me. He said he was
    frightened I might make a mess of it, and he did it himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did what? Make a mess of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made a mess of the other man that slandered that publican. I&rsquo;d
    be funny if I was you. Where&rsquo;s the matches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And could Tom fight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Tom could fight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you travel long with him after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead&mdash;Give us the matches.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HisFathersMate"></a>His Father&rsquo;s Mate</b></h2>
  <p>It was Golden Gully still, but golden in name only, unless indeed the yellow
    mullock heaps or the bloom of the wattle-trees on the hillside gave it a
    claim to the title. But the gold was gone from the gully, and the diggers
    were gone, too, after the manner of Timon&rsquo;s friends when his wealth
    deserted him. Golden Gully was a dreary place, dreary even for an abandoned
    goldfield. The poor, tortured earth, with its wounds all bare, seemed to
    make a mute appeal to the surrounding bush to come up and hide it, and, as
    if in answer to its appeal, the shrub and saplings were beginning to close
    in from the foot of the range. The wilderness was reclaiming its own again.</p>
  <p>The two dark, sullen hills that stood on each side were clothed from tip
    to hollow with dark scrub and scraggy box-trees; but above the highest row
    of shafts on one side ran a line of wattle-trees in full bloom.</p>
  <p>The top of the western hill was shaped somewhat like a saddle, and standing
    high above the eucalypti on the point corresponding with the pommel were
    three tall pines. These lonely trees, seen for many miles around, had caught
    the yellow rays of many a setting sun long before the white man wandered
    over the ranges.</p>
  <p>The predominant note of the scene was a painful sense of listening, that
    never seemed to lose its tension&mdash;a listening as though for the sounds
    of digger life, sounds that had gone and left a void that was accentuated
    by the signs of a former presence. The main army of diggers had long ago
    vanished to new rushes, leaving only its stragglers and deserters behind.
    These were men who were too poor to drag families about, men who were old
    and feeble, and men who had lost their faith in fortune. They had dropped
    unnoticed out of the ranks; and remained to scratch out a living among the
    abandoned claims.</p>
  <p>Golden Gully had its little community of fossickers who lived in a clearing
    called Spencer&rsquo;s Flat on one side and Pounding Flat on the other, but
    they lent no life to the scene; they only haunted it. A stranger might have
    thought the field entirely deserted until he came on a coat and a billy at
    the foot of saplings amongst the holes, and heard, in the shallow ground
    underneath, the thud of a pick, which told of some fossicker below rooting
    out what little wash remained.</p>
  <p>One afternoon towards Christmas, a windlass was erected over an old shaft
    of considerable depth at the foot of the gully. A greenhide bucket attached
    to a rope on the windlass was lying next morning near the mouth of the shaft,
    and beside it, on a clear-swept patch, was a little mound of cool wet wash-dirt.</p>
  <p>A clump of saplings near at hand threw a shade over part of the mullock
    heap, and in this shade, seated on an old coat, was a small boy of eleven
    or twelve years, writing on a slate.</p>
  <p>He had fair hair, blue eyes, and a thin old-fashioned face&mdash;a face
    that would scarcely alter as he grew to manhood. His costume consisted of
    a pair of moleskin trousers, a cotton shirt, and one suspender. He held the
    slate rigidly with a corner of its frame pressed close against his ribs,
    whilst his head hung to one side, so close to the slate that his straggling
    hair almost touched it. He was regarding his work fixedly out of the corners
    of his eyes, whilst he painfully copied down the head line, spelling it in
    a different way each time. In this laborious task he appeared to be greatly
    assisted by a tongue that lolled out of the corner of his mouth and made
    an occasional revolution round it, leaving a circle of temporarily clean
    face. His small clay-covered toes also entered into the spirit of the thing,
    and helped him not a little by their energetic wriggling. He paused occasionally
    to draw the back of his small brown arm across his mouth.</p>
  <p>Little Isley Mason, or, as he was called, &ldquo;His Father&rsquo;s Mate,&rdquo; had
    always been a favourite with the diggers and fossickers from the days when
    he used to slip out first thing in the morning and take a run across the
    frosty flat in his shirt. Long Bob Sawkins would often tell how Isley came
    home one morning from his run in the long, wet grass as naked as he was born,
    with the information that he had lost his shirt.</p>
  <p>Later on, when most of the diggers had gone, and Isley&rsquo;s mother was
    dead, he was to be seen about the place with bare, sunbrowned arms and legs,
    a pick and shovel, and a gold dish about two-thirds of his height in diameter,
    with which he used to go &ldquo;a-speckin&rsquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;fossickin&rsquo;&rdquo; amongst
    the old mullock heaps. Long Bob was Isley&rsquo;s special crony, and he would
    often go out of his way to lay the boy outer bits o&rsquo; wash and likely
    spots, lamely excusing his long yarns with the child by the explanation that
    it was &ldquo;amusin&rsquo; to draw Isley out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley had been sitting writing for some time when a deep voice called out
    from below:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send down the bucket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley put down his slate, and going to the shaft dropped the bucket down
    as far as the slack rope reached; then, placing one hand on the bole of the
    windlass and holding the other against it underneath, he let it slip round
    between his palms until the bucket reached bottom. A sound of shovelling
    was heard for a few moments, and presently the voice cried, &ldquo;Wind away,
    sonny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thet ain&rsquo;t half enough,&rdquo; said the boy, peering down. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    be frightened to pile it in, father. I kin wind up a lot more&rsquo;n thet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A little more scraping, and the boy braced his feet well upon the little
    mound of clay which he had raised under the handle of the windlass to make
    up for his deficiency in stature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley wound slowly but sturdily, and soon the bucket of &ldquo;wash&rdquo; appeared
    above the surface; then he took it in short lifts and deposited it with the
    rest of the wash-dirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo; called his father again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you done that writing lesson yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very near.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then send down the slate next time for some sums.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy resumed his seat, fixed the corner of the slate well into his ribs,
    humped his back, and commenced another wavering line.</p>
  <p>Tom Mason was known on the place as a silent, hard worker. He was a man
    of about sixty, tall, and dark bearded. There was nothing uncommon about
    his face, except, perhaps, that it hardened, as the face of a man might harden
    who had suffered a long succession of griefs and disappointments. He lived
    in a little hut under a peppermint tree at the far edge of Pounding Flat.
    His wife had died there about six years before, and new rushes broke out
    and he was well able to go, he never left Golden Gully.</p>
  <p>Mason was kneeling in front of the &ldquo;face&rdquo; digging away by the
    light of a tallow candle stuck in the side. The floor of the drive was very
    wet, and his trousers were heavy and cold with clay and water; but the old
    digger was used to this sort of thing. His pick was not bringing out much
    to-day, however, for he seemed abstracted and would occasionally pause in
    his work, while his thoughts wandered far away from the narrow streak of
    wash-dirt in the &ldquo;face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was digging out pictures from a past life. They were not pleasant ones,
    for his face was stony and white in the dim glow of the candle.</p>
  <p>Thud, thud, thud&mdash;the blows became slower and more irregular as the
    fossicker&rsquo;s mind wandered off into the past. The sides of the drive
    seemed to vanish slowly away, and the &ldquo;face&rdquo; retreated far out
    beyond a horizon that was hazy in the glow of the southern ocean. He was
    standing on the deck of a ship and by his side stood a brother. They were
    sailing southward to the Land of Promise that was shining there in all its
    golden glory! The sails pressed forward in the bracing wind, and the clipper
    ship raced along with its burden of the wildest dreamers ever borne in a
    vessel&rsquo;s hull! Up over long blue ocean ridges, down into long blue
    ocean gullies; on to lands so new, and yet so old, where above the sunny
    glow of the southern skies blazed the shining names of Ballarat! and Bendigo!
    The deck seemed to lurch, and the fossicker fell forward against the face
    of the drive. The shock recalled him, and he lifted his pick once more.</p>
  <p>But the blows slacken again as another vision rises before him. It is Ballarat
    now. He is working in a shallow claim at Eureka, his brother by his side.
    The brother looks pale and ill, for he has been up all night dancing and
    drinking. Out behind them is the line of blue hills; in front is the famous
    Bakery Hill, and down to the left Golden Point. Two mounted troopers are
    riding up over Specimen Hill. What do they want?</p>
  <p>They take the brother away, handcuffed. Manslaughter last night. Cause&mdash;drink
    and jealousy.</p>
  <p>The vision is gone again. Thud, thud, goes the pick; it counts the years
    that follow&mdash;one, two, three, four, up to twenty, and then it stops
    for the next scene&mdash;a selection on the banks of a bright river in New
    South Wales. The little homestead is surrounded by vines and fruit-trees.
    Many swarms of bees work under the shade of the trees, and a crop of wheat
    is nearly ripe on the hillside.</p>
  <p>A man and a boy are engaged in clearing a paddock just below the homestead.
    They are father and son; the son, a boy of about seventeen, is the image
    of his father.</p>
  <p>Horses&rsquo; feet again! Here comes Nemesis in mounted troopers&rsquo; uniform.</p>
  <p>The mail was stuck up last night about five miles away, and a refractory
    passenger shot. The son had been out &rsquo;possum shooting&rsquo; all night
    with some friends.</p>
  <p>The troopers take the son away handcuffed: &ldquo;Robbery under arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The father was taking out a stump when the troopers came. His foot is still
    resting on the spade, which is half driven home. He watches the troopers
    take the boy up to the house, and then, driving the spade to its full depth,
    he turns up another sod. The troopers reach the door of the homestead; but
    still he digs steadily, and does not seem to hear his wife&rsquo;s cry of
    despair. The troopers search the boy&rsquo;s room and bring out some clothing
    in two bundles; but still the father digs. They have saddled up one of the
    farm horses and made the boy mount. The father digs. They ride off along
    the ridge with the boy between them. The father never lifts his eyes; the
    hole widens round the stump; he digs away till the brave little wife comes
    and takes him gently by the arm. He half rouses himself and follows her to
    the house like an obedient dog.</p>
  <p>Trial and disgrace follow, and then other misfortunes, pleuro among the
    cattle, drought, and poverty.</p>
  <p>Thud, thud, thud again! But it is not the sound of the fossicker&rsquo;s
    pick&mdash;it is the fall of sods on his wife&rsquo;s coffin.</p>
  <p>It is a little bush cemetery, and he stands stonily watching them fill up
    her grave. She died of a broken heart and shame. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear
    disgrace! I can&rsquo;t bear disgrace!&rdquo; she had moaned all these six
    weary years&mdash;for the poor are often proud.</p>
  <p>But he lives on, for it takes a lot to break a man&rsquo;s heart. He holds
    up his head and toils on for the sake of a child that is left, and that child
    is&mdash;Isley.</p>
  <p>And now the fossicker seems to see a vision of the future. He seems to be
    standing somewhere, an old, old man, with a younger one at his side; the
    younger one has Isley&rsquo;s face. Horses&rsquo; feet again! Ah, God! Nemesis
    once more in troopers&rsquo;  uniform!</p>
  <p>The fossicker falls on his knees in the mud and clay at the bottom of the
    drive, and prays Heaven to take his last child ere Nemesis comes for him.</p>
  <p>Long Bob Sawkins had been known on the diggings as &ldquo;Bob the Devil.&rdquo;  His
    profile at least from one side, certainly did recall that of the sarcastic
    Mephistopheles; but the other side, like his true character, was by no means
    a devil&rsquo;s. His physiognomy had been much damaged, and one eye removed
    by the premature explosion of a blast in some old Ballarat mine. The blind
    eye was covered with a green patch, which gave a sardonic appearance to the
    remaining features.</p>
  <p>He was a stupid, heavy, good-natured Englishman. He stuttered a little,
    and had a peculiar habit of wedging the monosyllable &ldquo;why&rdquo; into
    his conversation at times when it served no other purpose than to fill up
    the pauses caused by his stuttering; but this by no means assisted him in
    his speech, for he often stuttered over the &ldquo;why&rdquo; itself.</p>
  <p>The sun was getting low down, and its yellow rays reached far up among the
    saplings of Golden Gully when Bob appeared coming down by the path that ran
    under the western hill. He was dressed in the usual costume-cotton shirt,
    moleskin trousers, faded hat and waistcoat, and blucher boots. He carried
    a pick over his shoulder, the handle of which was run through the heft of
    a short shovel that hung down behind, and he had a big dish under his arm.
    He paused opposite the shaft with the windlass, and hailed the boy in his
    usual form of salutation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look, see here Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Bob?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I seed a young&mdash;why&mdash;magpie up in the scrub, and yer oughter
    be able to catch it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t leave the shaft; father&rsquo;s b&rsquo;low.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did yer father know there was any&mdash;why&mdash;wash in the
    old shaft?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seed old Corney in town Saturday, &rsquo;n he said thur was enough
    to make it worth while bailin&rsquo; out. Bin bailin&rsquo; all the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob came over, and letting his tools down with a clatter he hitched up the
    knees of his moleskins and sat down on one heel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are yer&mdash;why&mdash;doin&rsquo; on the slate, Isley?&rdquo; said
    he, taking out an old clay pipe and lighting it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sums,&rdquo; said Isley.</p>
  <p>Bob puffed away at his pipe a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use!&rdquo; he said, sitting down on the clay
    and drawing his knees up. &ldquo;Edication&rsquo;s a failyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen at &rsquo;im!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy. &ldquo;D&rsquo;yer
    mean ter say it ain&rsquo;t no use learnin&rsquo; readin&rsquo; and writin&rsquo; and
    sums?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy went to the windlass and let the bucket down. Bob offered to help
    him wind up, but Isley, proud of showing his strength to his friend, insisted
    on winding by himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be&mdash;why&mdash;a strong man some day, Isley,&rdquo; said
    Bob, landing the bucket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I could wind up a lot more&rsquo;n father puts in. Look how I
    greased the handles! It works like butter now,&rdquo; and the boy sent the
    handles spinning round with a jerk to illustrate his meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did they call yer Isley for?&rdquo; queried Bob, as they resumed
    their seats. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t yer real name, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my name&rsquo;s Harry. A digger useter say I was a isle in the
    ocean to father &rsquo;n mother, &rsquo;n then I was nicknamed Isle, &rsquo;n
    then Isley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You hed a&mdash;why&mdash;brother once, didn&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but thet was afore I was borned. He died, at least mother used
    ter say she didn&rsquo;t know if he was dead; but father says he&rsquo;s
    dead as fur&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And your father hed a brother, too. Did yer ever&mdash;why&mdash;hear
    of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard father talkin&rsquo; about it wonst to mother. I think
    father&rsquo;s brother got into some row in a bar where a man was killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And was yer&mdash;why&mdash;father&mdash;why&mdash;fond of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard father say that he was wonst, but thet was all past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob smoked in silence for a while, and seemed to look at some dark clouds
    that were drifting along like a funeral out in the west. Presently he said
    half aloud something that sounded like &ldquo;All, all&mdash;why&mdash;past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Isley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s&mdash;why, why&mdash;nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered
    Bob, rousing himself. &ldquo;Is that a paper in yer father&rsquo;s coat-pocket,
    Isley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, taking it out.</p>
  <p>Bob took the paper and stared hard at it for a moment or so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about the new goldfields there,&rdquo; said
    Bob, putting his finger on a tailor&rsquo;s advertisement. &ldquo;I wish
    you&rsquo;d&mdash;why&mdash;read it to me, Isley; I can&rsquo;t see the small
    print they uses nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thet&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; said the boy, taking the paper, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    something about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Old on, Bob, father wants me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy ran to the shaft, rested his hands and forehead against the bole
    of the windlass, and leant over to hear what his father was saying.</p>
  <p>Without a moment&rsquo;s warning the treacherous bole slipped round; a small
    body bounded a couple of times against the sides of the shaft and fell at
    Mason&rsquo;s feet, where it lay motionless!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mason!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put him in the bucket and lash him to the rope with your belt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few moments, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob&rsquo;s trembling hands would scarcely grasp the handle, but he managed
    to wind somehow.</p>
  <p>Presently the form of the child appeared, motionless and covered with clay
    and water. Mason was climbing up by the steps in the side of the shaft.</p>
  <p>Bob tenderly unlashed the boy and laid him under the saplings on the grass;
    then he wiped some of the clay and blood away from the child&rsquo;s forehead,
    and dashed over him some muddy water.</p>
  <p>Presently Isley gave a gasp and opened his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are yer&mdash;why&mdash;hurt much, Isley?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ba-back&rsquo;s bruk, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so bad as that, old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coming up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence awhile, and then&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father! father! be quick, father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mason reached the surface and came and knelt by the other side of the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;why&mdash;run fur some brandy,&rdquo; said
    Bob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No use, Bob,&rdquo; said Isley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all bruk up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer feel better, sonny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;goin&rsquo; to&mdash;die, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, Isley,&rdquo; groaned Bob.</p>
  <p>A short silence, and then the boy&rsquo;s body suddenly twisted with pain.
    But it was soon over. He lay still awhile, and then said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob made a vain attempt to speak. &ldquo;Isley!&rdquo; he said,&rdquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The child turned and stretched out his hands to the silent, stony-faced
    man on the other side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;father, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shuddering groan broke from Mason&rsquo;s lips, and then all was quiet.</p>
  <p>Bob had taken off his hat to wipe his, forehead, and his face, in spite
    of its disfigurement, was strangely like the face of the stone-like man opposite.</p>
  <p>For a moment they looked at one another across the body of the child, and
    then Bob said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never knowed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; said Mason gruffly; and, taking up the
    dead child, he walked towards the hut.</p>
  <p>It was a very sad little group that gathered outside Mason&rsquo;s hut next
    morning. Martin&rsquo;s wife had been there all the morning cleaning up and
    doing what she could. One of the women had torn up her husband&rsquo;s only
    white shirt for a shroud, and they had made the little body look clean and
    even beautiful in the wretched little hut.</p>
  <p>One after another the fossickers took off their hats and entered, stooping
    through the low door. Mason sat silently at the foot of the bunk with his
    head supported by his hand, and watched the men with a strange, abstracted
    air.</p>
  <p>Bob had ransacked the camp in search of some boards for a coffin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be the last I&rsquo;ll be able to&mdash;why&mdash;do for
    him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>At last he came to Mrs Martin in despair. That lady took him into the dining-room,
    and pointed to a large pine table, of which she was very proud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Knock that table to pieces,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Taking off the few things that were lying on it, Bob turned it over and
    began to knock the top off.</p>
  <p>When he had finished the coffin one of the fossicker&rsquo;s wives said
    it looked too bare, and she ripped up her black riding-skirt, and made Bob
    tack the cloth over the coffin.</p>
  <p>There was only one vehicle available in the place, and that was Martin&rsquo;s
    old dray; so about two o&rsquo;clock Pat Martin attached his old horse Dublin
    to the shafts with sundry bits of harness and plenty of old rope, and dragged
    Dublin, dray and all, across to Mason&rsquo;s hut.</p>
  <p>The little coffin was carried out, and two gin-cases were placed by its
    side in the dray to serve as seats for Mrs Martin and Mrs Grimshaw, who mounted
    in tearful silence.</p>
  <p>Pat Martin felt for his pipe, but remembered himself and mounted on the
    shaft. Mason fastened up the door of the hut with a padlock. A couple of
    blows on one of his sharp points roused Dublin from his reverie. With a lurch
    to the right and another to the left he started, and presently the little
    funeral disappeared down the road that led to the &ldquo;town&rdquo; and
    its cemetery.</p>
  <p>About six months afterwards Bob Sawkins went on a short journey, and returned
    with a tall, bearded young man. He and Bob arrived after dark, and went straight
    to Mason&rsquo;s hut. There was a light inside, but when Bob knocked there
    was no answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go in; don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said to his companion.</p>
  <p>The stranger pushed open the creaking door, and stood bareheaded just inside
    the doorway.</p>
  <p>A billy was boiling unheeded on the fire. Mason sat at the table with his
    face buried in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer, but the flickering of the firelight made the stranger
    think he could detect an impatient shrug in Mason&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
  <p>For a moment the stranger paused irresolute, and then stepping up to the
    table he laid his hand on Mason&rsquo;s arm, and said gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father! Do you want another mate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the sleeper did not&mdash;at least, not in this world.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnEchoFromTheOldBarkSchool"></a>An Echo From The Old Bark School</b></h2>
  <p>It was the first Monday after the holidays. The children had taken their
    seats in the Old Bark School, and the master called out the roll as usual:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie Aspinall.&rdquo;... &ldquo;&rsquo;Es, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;David Cooper.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;John Heegard.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yezzer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joseph Swallow.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yesser.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James Bullock.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick Swallow.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Y&rsquo;sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James Nowlett.&rdquo;... . (Chorus of &ldquo;Absent.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;William Atkins.&rdquo;... (Chorus of &ldquo;Absent.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daniel Lyons.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Perresent, sor-r-r.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dan was a young immigrant, just out from the sod, and rolled his &ldquo;r&rsquo;s&rdquo;  like
    a cock-dove. His brogue was rich enough to make an Irishman laugh.</p>
  <p>Bill was &ldquo;wagging it.&rdquo; His own especial chum was of the opinion
    that Bill was sick. The master&rsquo;s opinion did not coincide, so he penned
    a note to William&rsquo;s parents, to be delivered by the model boy of the
    school.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertha Lambert.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May Carey.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Pesin&rsquo;, sair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rose Cooper.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janet Wild.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Y-y-yes, s-sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary Wild.&rdquo;...</p>
  <p>A solemn hush fell upon the school, and presently Janet Wild threw her arms
    out on the desk before her, let her face fall on them, and sobbed heart-brokenly.
    The master saw his mistake too late; he gave his head a little half-affirmative,
    half-negative movement, in that pathetic old way of his; rested his head
    on one hand, gazed sadly at the name, and sighed.</p>
  <p>But the galoot of the school spoilt the pathos of it all, for, during the
    awed silence which followed the calling of the girl&rsquo;s name, he suddenly
    brightened up&mdash;the first time he was ever observed to do so during school
    hours&mdash;and said, briskly and cheerfully &ldquo;Dead&mdash;sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He hadn&rsquo;t been able to answer a question correctly for several days.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; said the master gravely and sadly, &ldquo;children,
    this is the first time I ever had to put &lsquo;D&rsquo; to the name of one
    of my scholars. Poor Mary! she was one of my first pupils&mdash;came the
    first morning the school was opened. Children, I want you to be a little
    quieter to-day during play-hour, out of respect for the name of your dead
    schoolmate whom it has pleased the Almighty to take in her youth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; asked the galoot, evidently encouraged by his
    fancied success, &ldquo;please, sir, what does &lsquo;D&rsquo; stand for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn you for a hass!&rdquo; snarled Jim Bullock between his teeth,
    giving the galoot a vicious dig in the side with his elbow.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShearingOfTheCooksDog"></a>The Shearing Of The Cook&rsquo;s Dog</b></h2>
  <p>The dog was a little conservative mongrel poodle, with long dirty white
    hair all over him&mdash;longest and most over his eyes, which glistened through
    it like black beads. Also he seemed to have a bad liver. He always looked
    as if he was suffering from a sense of injury, past or to come. It did come.
    He used to follow the shearers up to the shed after breakfast every morning,
    but he couldn&rsquo;t have done this for love&mdash;there was none lost between
    him and the men. He wasn&rsquo;t an affectionate dog; it wasn&rsquo;t his
    style. He would sit close against the shed for an hour or two, and hump himself,
    and sulk, and look sick, and snarl whenever the &ldquo;Sheep-Ho&rdquo; dog
    passed, or a man took notice of him. Then he&rsquo;d go home. What he wanted
    at the shed at all was only known to himself; no one asked him to come. Perhaps
    he came to collect evidence against us. The cook called him &ldquo;my darg,&rdquo; and
    the men called the cook  &ldquo;Curry and Rice,&rdquo; with &ldquo;old&rdquo; before
    it mostly.</p>
  <p>Rice was a little, dumpy, fat man, with a round, smooth, good-humoured face,
    a bald head, feet wide apart, and a big blue cotton apron. He had been a
    ship&rsquo;s cook. He didn&rsquo;t look so much out of place in the hut as
    the hut did round him. To a man with a vivid imagination, if he regarded
    the cook dreamily for a while, the floor might seem to roll gently like the
    deck of a ship, and mast, rigging, and cuddy rise mistily in the background.
    Curry might have dreamed of the cook&rsquo;s galley at times, but he never
    mentioned it. He ought to have been at sea, or comfortably dead and stowed
    away under ground, instead of cooking for a mob of unredeemed rouseabouts
    in an uncivilized shed in the scrub, six hundred miles from the ocean.</p>
  <p>They chyacked the cook occasionally, and grumbled&mdash;or pretended to
    grumble&mdash;about their tucker, and then he&rsquo;d make a roughly pathetic
    speech, with many references to his age, and the hardness of his work, and
    the smallness of his wages, and the inconsiderateness of the men. Then the
    joker of the shed would sympathize with the cook with his tongue and one
    side of his face&mdash;and joke with the other.</p>
  <p>One day in the shed, during smoke-ho the devil whispered to a shearer named
    Geordie that it would be a lark to shear the cook&rsquo;s dog&mdash;the Evil
    One having previously arranged that the dog should be there, sitting close
    to Geordie&rsquo;s pen, and that the shearer should have a fine lamb comb
    on his machine. The idea was communicated through Geordie to his mates, and
    met with entire and general approval; and for five or ten minutes the air
    was kept alive by shouting and laughter of the men, and the protestations
    of the dog. When the shearer touched skin, he yelled &ldquo;Tar!&rdquo;  and
    when he finished he shouted &ldquo;Wool away!&rdquo; at the top of his voice,
    and his mates echoed him with a will. A picker-up gathered the fleece with
    a great show of labour and care, and tabled it, to the well-ventilated disgust
    of old Scotty, the wool-roller. When they let the dog go he struck for home&mdash;a
    clean-shaven poodle, except for a ferocious moustache and a tuft at the end
    of his tail.</p>
  <p>The cook&rsquo;s assistant said that he&rsquo;d have given a five-pound
    note for a portrait of Curry-and-Rice when that poodle came back from the
    shed. The cook was naturally very indignant; he was surprised at first&mdash;then
    he got mad. He had the whole afternoon to get worked up in, and at tea-time
    he went for the men properly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wotter yer growlin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; asked one. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s
    the matter with yer, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about yer dog!&rdquo; protested a rouseabout; &ldquo;wotyer
    gettin&rsquo; on to me for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wotter they bin doin&rsquo; to the cook now?&rdquo; inquired a ring
    leader innocently, as he sprawled into his place at the table. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
    yer let Curry alone? Wot d&rsquo;yer want to be chyackin&rsquo; him for?
    Give it a rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look here, chaps,&rdquo; observed Geordie, in a determined
    tone, &ldquo;I call it a shame, that&rsquo;s what I call it. Why couldn&rsquo;t
    you leave an old man&rsquo;s dog alone? It was a mean, dirty trick to do,
    and I suppose you thought it funny. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,
    the whole lot of you, for a drafted mob of crawlers. If I&rsquo;d been there
    it wouldn&rsquo;t have been done; and I wouldn&rsquo;t blame Curry if he
    was to poison the whole convicted push.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>General lowering of faces and pulling of hats down over eyes, and great
    working of knives and forks; also sounds like men trying not to laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you play a trick on another man&rsquo;s darg?&rdquo; said
    Curry.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use tellin&rsquo; me. I can see it all as plain
    as if I was on the board&mdash;all of you runnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; shoutin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cheerin&rsquo; an&rsquo; laughin&rsquo;,
    and all over shearin&rsquo; and ill-usin&rsquo; a poor little darg! Why couldn&rsquo;t
    you play a trick on another man&rsquo;s darg?... It doesn&rsquo;t matter
    much&mdash;I&rsquo;m nearly done cookie&rsquo; here now.... Only that I&rsquo;ve
    got a family to think of I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; stayed so long.
    I&rsquo;ve got to be up at five every mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
    get to bed till ten at night, cookin&rsquo; an&rsquo; bakin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cleanin&rsquo;  for
    you an&rsquo; waitin&rsquo; on you. First one lot in from the wool-wash,
    an&rsquo; then one lot in from the shed, an&rsquo; another lot in, an&rsquo; at
    all hours an&rsquo; times, an&rsquo; all wantin&rsquo;  their meals kept
    hot, an&rsquo; then they ain&rsquo;t satisfied. And now you must go an&rsquo; play
    a dirty trick on my darg! Why couldn&rsquo;t you have a lark with some other
    man&rsquo;s darg!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Geordie bowed his head and ate as though he had a cud, like a cow, and could
    chew at leisure. He seemed ashamed, as indeed we all were&mdash;secretly.
    Poor old Curry&rsquo;s oft-repeated appeal, &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you
    play a trick with another man&rsquo;s dog?&rdquo; seemed to have something
    pathetic about it. The men didn&rsquo;t notice that it lacked philanthropy
    and logic, and probably the cook didn&rsquo;t notice it either, else he wouldn&rsquo;t
    have harped on it. Geordie lowered his face, and just then, as luck or the
    devil would have it, he caught sight of the dog. Then he exploded.</p>
  <p>The cook usually forgot all about it in an hour, and then, if you asked
    him what the chaps had been doing, he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Oh, nothing! nothing!
    Only their larks!&rdquo;  But this time he didn&rsquo;t; he was narked for
    three days, and the chaps marvelled much and were sorry, and treated him
    with great respect and consideration. They hadn&rsquo;t thought he&rsquo;d
    take it so hard&mdash;the dog shearing business&mdash;else they wouldn&rsquo;t
    have done it. They were a little puzzled too, and getting a trifle angry,
    and would shortly be prepared to take the place of the injured party, and
    make things unpleasant for the cook. However, he brightened up towards the
    end of the week, and then it all came out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; minded so much,&rdquo; he said,
    standing by the table with a dipper in one hand, a bucket in the other, and
    a smile on his face. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t  &rsquo;a&rsquo; minded so much
    only they&rsquo;ll think me a flash man in Bourke with that theer darg trimmed
    up like that!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="DossingOutAndCamping"></a>&ldquo;Dossing Out&rdquo; And &ldquo;Camping&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>At least two hundred poor beggars were counted sleeping out on the pavements
    of the main streets of Sydney the other night&mdash;grotesque bundles of
    rags lying under the verandas of the old Fruit Markets and York Street shops,
    with their heads to the wall and their feet to the gutter. It was raining
    and cold that night, and the unemployed had been driven in from Hyde Park
    and the bleak Domain&mdash;from dripping trees, damp seats, and drenched
    grass&mdash;from the rain, and cold, and the wind. Some had sheets of old
    newspapers to cover them&mdash;and some hadn&rsquo;t. Two were mates, and
    they divided a <i>Herald</i> between them. One had a sheet of brown paper,
    and another (lucky man!) had a bag&mdash;the only bag there. They all shrank
    as far into their rags as possible&mdash;and tried to sleep. The rats seemed
    to take them for rubbish, too, and only scampered away when one of the outcasts
    moved uneasily, or coughed, or groaned&mdash;or when a policeman came along.</p>
  <p>One or two rose occasionally and rooted in the dust-boxes on the pavement
    outside the shops&mdash;but they didn&rsquo;t seem to get anything. They
    were feeling &ldquo;peckish,&rdquo;  no doubt, and wanted to see if they
    could get something to eat before the corporation carts came along. So did
    the rats.</p>
  <p>Some men can&rsquo;t sleep very well on an empty stomach&mdash;at least,
    not at first; but it mostly comes with practice. They often sleep for ever
    in London. Not in Sydney as yet&mdash;so we say.</p>
  <p>Now and then one of our outcasts would stretch his cramped limbs to ease
    them&mdash;but the cold soon made him huddle again. The pavement must have
    been hard on the men&rsquo;s &ldquo;points,&rdquo; too; they couldn&rsquo;t
    dig holes nor make soft places for their hips, as you can in camp out back.
    And then, again, the stones had nasty edges and awkward slopes, for the pavements
    were very uneven.</p>
  <p>The Law came along now and then, and had a careless glance at the unemployed
    in bed. They didn&rsquo;t look like sleeping beauties. The Law appeared to
    regard them as so much rubbish that ought not to have been placed there,
    and for the presence of which somebody ought to be prosecuted by the Inspector
    of Nuisances. At least, that was the expression the policeman had on his
    face.</p>
  <p>And so Australian workmen lay at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning in the
    streets of Sydney, and tried to get a little sleep before the traffic came
    along and took their bed.</p>
  <p>The idea of sleeping out might be nothing to bushmen&mdash;not even an idea;
    but &ldquo;dossing out&rdquo; in the city and &ldquo;camping&rdquo; in the
    bush are two very different things. In the bush you can light a fire, boil
    your billy, and make some tea&mdash;if you have any; also fry a chop (there
    are no sheep running round in the city). You can have a clean meal, take
    off your shirt and wash it, and wash yourself&mdash;if there&rsquo;s water
    enough&mdash;and feel fresh and clean. You can whistle and sing by the camp-fire,
    and make poetry, and breathe fresh air, and watch the everlasting stars that
    keep the mateless traveller from going mad as he lies in his lonely camp
    on the plains. Your privacy is even more perfect than if you had a suite
    of rooms at the Australia; you are at the mercy of no policeman; there&rsquo;s
    no one to watch you but God&mdash;and He won&rsquo;t move you on. God watches
    the &ldquo;dossers-out,&rdquo; too, in the city, but He doesn&rsquo;t keep
    them from being moved on or run in.</p>
  <p>With the city unemployed the case is entirely different. The city outcast
    cannot light a fire and boil a billy&mdash;even if he has one&mdash;he&rsquo;d
    be run in at once for attempting to commit arson, or create a riot, or on
    suspicion of being a person of unsound mind. If he took off his shirt to
    wash it, or went in for a swim, he&rsquo;d be had up for indecently exposing
    his bones&mdash;and perhaps he&rsquo;d get flogged. He cannot whistle or
    sing on his pavement bed at night, for, if he did, he&rsquo;d be violently
    arrested by two great policemen for riotous conduct. He doesn&rsquo;t see
    many stars, and he&rsquo;s generally too hungry to make poetry. He only sleeps
    on the pavement on sufferance, and when the policeman finds the small hours
    hang heavily on him, he can root up the unemployed with his big foot and
    move him on&mdash;or arrest him for being around with the intention to commit
    a felony; and, when the wretched &ldquo;dosser&rdquo; rises in the morning,
    he cannot shoulder his swag and take the track&mdash;he must cadge a breakfast
    at some back gate or restaurant, and then sit in the park or walk round and
    round, the same old hopeless round, all day. There&rsquo;s no prison like
    the city for a poor man.</p>
  <p>Nearly every man the traveller meets in the bush is about as dirty and ragged
    as himself, and just about as hard up; but in the city nearly every man the
    poor unemployed meets is a dude, or at least, well dressed, and the unemployed <i>feels</i> dirty
    and mean and degraded by the contrast&mdash;and despised.</p>
  <p>And he can&rsquo;t help feeling like a criminal. It may be imagination,
    but every policeman seems to regard him with suspicion, and this is terrible
    to a sensitive man.</p>
  <p>We once had the key of the street for a night. We don&rsquo;t know how much
    tobacco we smoked, how many seats we sat on, or how many miles we walked
    before morning. But we do know that we felt like a felon, and that every
    policeman seemed to regard us with a suspicious eye; and at last we began
    to squint furtively at every trap we met, which, perhaps, made him more suspicious,
    till finally we felt bad enough to be run in and to get six months&rsquo; hard.</p>
  <p>Three winters ago a man, whose name doesn&rsquo;t matter, had a small office
    near Elizabeth Street, Sydney. He was an hotel broker, debt collector, commission
    agent, canvasser, and so on, in a small way&mdash;a very small way&mdash;but
    his heart was big. He had a partner. They batched in the office, and did
    their cooking over a gas lamp. Now, every day the man-whose-name-doesn&rsquo;t-matter
    would carefully collect the scraps of food, add a slice or two of bread and
    butter, wrap it all up in a piece of newspaper, and, after dark, step out
    and leave the parcel on a ledge of the stonework outside the building in
    the street. Every morning it would be gone. A shadow came along in the night
    and took it. This went on for many months, till at last one night the man-whose-name-doesn&rsquo;t-matter
    forgot to put the parcel out, and didn&rsquo;t think of it till he was in
    bed. It worried him, so that at last he had to get up and put the scraps
    outside. It was midnight. He felt curious to see the shadow, so he waited
    until it came along. It wasn&rsquo;t his long-lost brother, but it was an
    old mate of his.</p>
  <p>Let us finish with a sketch:</p>
  <p>The scene was Circular Quay, outside the Messageries sheds. The usual number
    of bundles of misery&mdash;covered more or less with dirty sheets of newspaper&mdash;lay
    along the wall under the ghastly glare of the electric light. Time&mdash;shortly
    after midnight. From among the bundles an old man sat up. He cautiously drew
    off his pants, and then stood close to the wall, in his shirt, tenderly examining
    the seat of the trousers. Presently he shook them out, folded them with great
    care, wrapped them in a scrap of newspaper, and laid them down where his
    head was to be. He had thin, hairy legs and a long grey beard. From a bundle
    of rags he extracted another pair of pants, which were all patches and tatters,
    and into which he engineered his way with great caution. Then he sat down,
    arranged the paper over his knees, laid his old ragged grey head back on
    his precious Sunday-go-meetings-and slept.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00108-images/page172.jpg" width="470" height="750"></p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AcrossTheStraits"></a>Across The Straits</b></h2>
  <p>We crossed Cook&rsquo;s Straits from Wellington in one of those rusty little
    iron tanks that go up and down and across there for twenty or thirty years
    and never get wrecked&mdash;for no other reason, apparently, than that they
    have every possible excuse to go ashore or go down on those stormy coasts.
    The age, construction, or condition of these boats, and the south-easters,
    and the construction of the coastline, are all decidedly in favour of their
    going down; the fares are high and the accommodation is small and dirty.
    It is always the same where there is no competition.</p>
  <p>A year or two ago, when a company was running boats between Australia and
    New Zealand without competition, the steerage fare was three pound direct
    single, and two pound ten shillings between Auckland and Wellington. The
    potatoes were black and green and soggy, the beef like bits scraped off the
    inside of a hide which had lain out for a day or so, the cabbage was cabbage
    leaves, the tea muddy. The whole business took away our appetite regularly
    three times a day, and there wasn&rsquo;t enough to go round, even if it
    had been good&mdash;enough tucker, we mean; there was enough appetite to
    go round three or four times, but it was driven away by disgust until after
    meals. If we had not, under cover of darkness, broached a deck cargo of oranges,
    lemons, and pineapples, and thereby run the risk of being run in on arrival,
    there would have been starvation, disease, and death on that boat before
    the end&mdash;perhaps mutiny.</p>
  <p>You can go across now for one pound, and get something to eat on the road;
    but the travelling public will go on patronizing the latest reducer of fares
    until the poorer company gets starved out and fares go up again&mdash;then
    the travelling public will have to pay three or four times as much as they
    do now, and go hungry on the voyage; all of which ought to go to prove that
    the travelling public is as big a fool as the general public.</p>
  <p>We can&rsquo;t help thinking that the captains and crews of our primitive
    little coastal steamers take the chances so often that they in time get used
    to it, and, being used to it, have no longer any misgivings or anxiety in
    rough weather concerning a watery grave, but feel as perfectly safe as if
    they were in church with their wives or sisters&mdash;only more comfortable&mdash;and
    go on feeling so until the worn-out machinery breaks down and lets the old
    tub run ashore, or knocks a hole in her side, or the side itself rusts through
    at last and lets the water in, or the last straw in the shape of an extra
    ton of brine tumbles on board, and the <i>John Smith (Newcastle)</i>, goes
    down with a swoosh before the cook has time to leave off peeling his potatoes
    and take to prayer.</p>
  <p>These cheerful&mdash;and, maybe, unjust&mdash;reflections are perhaps in
    consequence of our having lost half a sovereign to start with. We arrived
    at the booking-office with two minutes to spare, two sticks of Juno tobacco,
    a spare wooden pipe&mdash;in case we lost the other&mdash;a letter to a friend&rsquo;s
    friend down south, a pound note (Bank of New Zealand), and two half-crowns,
    with which to try our fortunes in the South Island. We also had a few things
    in a portmanteau and two blankets in a three-bushel bag, but they didn&rsquo;t
    amount to much. The clerk put down the ticket with the half-sovereign on
    top of it, and we wrapped the latter in the former and ran for the wharf.
    On the way we snatched the ticket out to see the name of the boat we were
    going by, in order to find it, and it was then, we suppose, that the semi-quid
    got lost.</p>
  <p>Did you ever lose a sovereign or a half-sovereign under similar circumstances?
    You think of it casually and feel for it carelessly at first, to be sure
    that it&rsquo;s there all right; then, after going through your pockets three
    or four times with rapidly growing uneasiness, you lose your head a little
    and dredge for that coin hurriedly and with painful anxiety. Then you force
    yourself to be calm, and proceed to search yourself systematically, in a
    methodical manner. At this stage, if you have time, it&rsquo;s a good plan
    to sit down and think out when and where you last had that half-sovereign,
    and where you have been since, and which way you came from there, and what
    you took out of your pocket, and where, and whether you might have given
    it in mistake for sixpence at that pub where you rushed in to have a beer&mdash;and
    then you calculate the chances against getting it back again. The last of
    these reflections is apt to be painful, and the painfulness is complicated
    and increased when there happen to have been several pubs and a like number
    of hurried farewell beers in the recent past.</p>
  <p>And for months after that you cannot get rid of the idea that that half-sov.
    might be about your clothes somewhere. It haunts you. You turn your pockets
    out, and feel the lining of your coat and vest inch by inch, and examine
    your letter papers&mdash;everything you happen to have had in your pocket
    that day&mdash;over and over again, and by and by you peer in envelopes and
    unfold papers that you didn&rsquo;t have in your pocket at all, but might
    have had. And when the novelty of the first search has worn off, and the
    fit takes you, you make another search. Even after many months have passed
    away, some day&mdash;or night&mdash;when you are hard up for tobacco and
    a drink, you suddenly think of that late lamented half-sov., and are moved
    by adverse circumstances to look through your old clothes in a sort of forlorn
    hope, or to give good luck a sort of chance to surprise you&mdash;the only
    chance that you can give it.</p>
  <p>By the way, seven-and-six of that half-quid should have gone to the landlord
    of the hotel where we stayed last, and somehow, in spite of this enlightened
    age, the loss of it seemed a judgment; and seeing that the boat was old and
    primitive, and there was every sign of a three days&rsquo; sou&rsquo;-easter,
    we sincerely hoped that judgment was complete&mdash;that supreme wrath had
    been appeased by the fine of ten bob without adding any Jonah business to
    it.</p>
  <p>This reminds us that we once found a lost half-sovereign in the bowl of
    a spare pipe six months after it was lost. We wish it had stayed there and
    turned up to-night. But, although when you are in great danger&mdash;say,
    adrift in an open boat&mdash;tales of providential escapes and rescues may
    interest and comfort you, you can&rsquo;t get any comfort out of anecdotes
    concerning the turning up of lost quids when you have just lost one yourself.
    All you want is to find it.</p>
  <p>It bothers you even not to be able to account for a bob. You always like
    to know that you have had something for your money, if only a long beer.
    You would sooner know that you fooled your money away on a spree, and made
    yourself sick than lost it out of an extra hole in your pocket, and kept
    well.</p>
  <p>We left Wellington with a feeling of pained regret, a fellow-wanderer by
    our side telling us how he had once lost &ldquo;fi-pun-note&rdquo;&mdash;and
    about two-thirds of the city unemployed on the wharf looking for that half-sovereign.
    Well, we hope that some poor devil found it; although, to tell the truth,
    we would then have by far preferred to have found it ourselves.</p>
  <p>A sailor said that the <i>Moa</i> was a good sea-boat, and, although she
    was small and old, <i>he</i> was never afraid of her. He&rsquo;d sooner travel
    in her than in some of those big cheap ocean liners with more sand in them
    than iron or steel&mdash;You, know the rest. Further on, in a conversation
    concerning the age of these coasters, he said that they&rsquo;d last fully
    thirty years if well painted and looked after. He said that this one was
    seldom painted, and never painted properly; and then, seemingly in direct
    contradiction to his previously expressed confidence in the safety and seaworthiness
    of the <i>Moa</i>, he said that he could poke a stick through her anywhere.
    We asked him not to do it.</p>
  <p>It came on to splash, and we went below to reflect, and search once more
    for that half-sovereign. The cabin was small and close, and dimly lighted,
    and evil smelling, and shaped like the butt end of a coffin. It might not
    have smelt so bad if we hadn&rsquo;t lost that half-sovereign. There was
    a party of those gipsy-like Assyrians&mdash;two families apparently&mdash;the
    women and children lying very sick about the lower bunks; and a big, good-humoured-looking
    young Maori propped between the end of the table and the wall, playing a
    concertina. The sick people were too sick, and the concertina seemed too
    much in sympathy with them, and the lost half-quid haunted us more than ever
    down there; so we started to climb out.</p>
  <p>The first thing that struck us was the jagged top edge of that iron hood-like
    arrangement over the gangway. The top half only of the scuttle was open.
    There was nothing to be seen except a fog of spray and a Newfoundland dog
    sea-sick under the lee of something. The next thing that struck us was a
    tub of salt water, which came like a cannon ball and broke against the hood
    affair, and spattered on deck like a crockery shop. We climbed down again
    backwards, and sat on the floor with emphasis, in consequence of stepping
    down a last step that wasn&rsquo;t there, and cracked the back of our heads
    against the edge of the table. The Maori helped us up, and we had a drink
    with him at the expense of one of the half-casers mentioned in the beginning
    of this sketch. Then the Maori shouted, then we, then the Maori again, then
    we again; and then we thought, &ldquo;Dash it, what&rsquo;s a half-sovereign?
    We&rsquo;ll fall on our feet all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went up Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Sound, a long crooked arm of the sea
    between big, rugged, black-looking hills. There was a sort of lighthouse
    down near the entrance, and they said an old Maori woman kept it. There were
    some whitish things on the sides of the hills, which we at first took for
    cattle, and then for goats. They were sheep. Someone said that that country
    was only fit to carry sheep. It must have been bad, then, judging from some
    of the country in Australia which is only fit to carry sheep. Country that
    wouldn&rsquo;t carry goats would carry sheep, we think. Sheep are about the
    hardiest animals on the face of this planet&mdash;barring crocodiles.</p>
  <p>You may rip a sheep open whilst watching for the boss&rsquo;s boots or yarning
    to a pen-mate, and then when you have stuffed the works back into the animal,
    and put a stitch in the slit, and poked it somewhere with a tar-stick (it
    doesn&rsquo;t matter much where) the jumbuck will be all right and just as
    lively as ever, and turn up next shearing without the ghost of a scratch
    on its skin.</p>
  <p>We reached Picton, a small collection of twinkling lights in a dark pocket,
    apparently at the top of a sound. We climbed up on to the wharf, got through
    between two railway trucks, and asked a policeman where we were, and where
    the telegraph office was. There were several pretty girls in the office,
    laughing and chyacking the counter clerks, which jarred upon the feelings
    of this poor orphan wanderer in strange lands. We gloomily took a telegram
    form, and wired to a friend in North Island, using the following words: &ldquo;Wire
    quid; stumped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then we crossed the street to a pub and asked for a roof and they told us
    to go up to No. 8. We went up, struck a match, lit the candle, put our bag
    in a corner, cleared the looking-glass off the toilet table, got some paper
    and a pencil out of our portmanteau, and sat down and wrote this sketch.</p>
  <p>The candle is going out.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SteelmansPupil"></a>Steelman&rsquo;s Pupil</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman was a hard case, but some said that Smith was harder. Steelman
    was big and good-looking, and good-natured in his way; he was a spieler,
    pure and simple, but did things in humorous style. Smith was small and weedy,
    of the sneak variety; he had a whining tone and a cringing manner. He seemed
    to be always so afraid you were going to hit him that he would make you want
    to hit him on that account alone.</p>
  <p>Steelman &ldquo;had&rdquo; you in a fashion that would make your friends
    laugh. Smith would &ldquo;have&rdquo; you in a way which made you feel mad
    at the bare recollection of having been taken in by so contemptible a little
    sneak.</p>
  <p>They battled round together in the North Island of Maoriland for a couple
    of years.</p>
  <p>One day Steelman said to Smith:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Smithy, you don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re born yet. I&rsquo;m
    going to take you in hand and teach you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he did. If Smith wouldn&rsquo;t do as Steelman told him, or wasn&rsquo;t
    successful in cadging, or mugged any game they had in hand, Steelman would
    threaten to stoush him; and, if the warning proved ineffectual after the
    second or third time, he would stoush him.</p>
  <p>One day, on the track, they came to a place where an old Scottish couple
    kept a general store and shanty. They camped alongside the road, and Smith
    was just starting up to the house to beg supplies when Steelman cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&mdash;hold on. Now where do you think you&rsquo;re going to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m going to try and chew the old party&rsquo;s lug, of
    course. We&rsquo;ll be out of tucker in a couple of days,&rdquo; said Smith.</p>
  <p>Steelman sat down on a stump in a hopeless, discouraged sort of way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said, regarding Smith with mingled reproach
    and disgust.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. I might as well give it best. I can
    see that it&rsquo;s only waste of time trying to learn you anything. Will
    I ever be able to knock some gumption into your thick skull? After all the
    time and trouble and pains I&rsquo;ve took with your education, you hain&rsquo;t
    got any more sense than to go and mug a business like that! When will you
    learn sense? Hey? After all, I&mdash;Smith, you&rsquo;re a born mug!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He always called Smith a &ldquo;mug&rdquo; when he was particularly wild
    at him, for it hurt Smith more than anything else. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only
    two classes in the world, spielers and mugs&mdash;and you&rsquo;re a mug,
    Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have I done, anyway?&rdquo; asked Smith helplessly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    all I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman wearily rested his brow on his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will do, Smith,&rdquo; he said listlessly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    say another word, old man; it&rsquo;ll only make my head worse; don&rsquo;t
    talk. You might, at the very least, have a little consideration for my feelings&mdash;even
    if you haven&rsquo;t for your own interests.&rdquo;  He paused and regarded
    Smith sadly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you another show. I&rsquo;ll stage
    the business for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made Smith doff his coat and get into his worst pair of trousers&mdash;and
    they were bad enough; they were hopelessly &ldquo;gone&rdquo; beyond the
    extreme limit of bush decency. He made Smith put on a rag of a felt hat and
    a pair of &ldquo;&rsquo;lastic-sides&rdquo;  which had fallen off a tramp
    and lain baking and rotting by turns on a rubbish heap; they had to be tied
    on Smith with bits of rag and string. He drew dark shadows round Smith&rsquo;s
    eyes, and burning spots on his cheek-bones with some greasepaints he used
    when they travelled as &ldquo;The Great Steelman and Smith Combination Star
    Dramatic Co.&rdquo;  He damped Smith&rsquo;s hair to make it dark and lank,
    and his face more corpse-like by comparison&mdash;in short, he made him up
    to look like a man who had long passed the very last stage of consumption,
    and had been artificially kept alive in the interests of science.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; said Steelman to Smith. &ldquo;You
    left your whare the day before yesterday and started to walk to the hospital
    at Palmerston. An old mate picked you up dying on the road, brought you round,
    and carried you on his back most of the way here. You firmly believe that
    Providence had something to do with the sending of that old mate along at
    that time and place above all others. Your mate also was hard up; he was
    going to a job&mdash;the first show for work he&rsquo;d had in nine months&mdash;but
    he gave it up to see you through; he&rsquo;d give up his life rather than
    desert a mate in trouble. You only want a couple of shillings or a bit of
    tucker to help you on to Palmerston. You know you&rsquo;ve got to die, and
    you only want to live long enough to get word to your poor old mother, and
    die on a bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember, they&rsquo;re Scotch up at that house. You understand the
    Scotch barrack pretty well by now&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t it ain&rsquo;t
    my fault. You were born in Aberdeen, but came out too young to remember much
    about the town. Your father&rsquo;s dead. You ran away to sea and came out
    in the <i>Bobbie Burns</i> to Sydney. Your poor old mother&rsquo;s in Aberdeen
    now&mdash;Bruce or Wallace Wynd will do. Your mother might be dead now&mdash;poor
    old soul!&mdash;any way, you&rsquo;ll never see her again. You wish you&rsquo;d
    never run away from home. You wish you&rsquo;d been a better son to your
    poor old mother; you wish you&rsquo;d written to her and answered her last
    letter. You only want to live long enough to write home and ask for forgiveness
    and a blessing before you die. If you had a drop of spirits of some sort
    to brace you up you might get along the road better. (Put this delicately.)
    Get the whine out of your voice and breathe with a wheeze&mdash;like this;
    get up the nearest approach to a deathrattle that you can. Move as if you
    were badly hurt in your wind&mdash;like this. (If you don&rsquo;t do it better&rsquo;n
    that, I&rsquo;ll stoush you.) Make your face a bit longer and keep your lips
    dry&mdash;don&rsquo;t lick them, you damned fool!&mdash;<i>breathe</i> on
    them; make &rsquo;em dry as chips. That&rsquo;s the only decent pair of breeks
    you&rsquo;ve got, and the only &ldquo;shoon.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re a Presbyterian&mdash;not
    a U.P., the Auld Kirk. Your mate would have come up to the house only&mdash;well,
    you&rsquo;ll have to use the stuffing in your head a bit; you can&rsquo;t
    expect me to do all the brain work. Remember it&rsquo;s consumption you&rsquo;ve
    got&mdash;galloping consumption; you know all the symptoms&mdash;pain on
    top of your right lung, bad cough, and night sweats. Something tells you
    that you won&rsquo;t see the new year&mdash;it&rsquo;s a week off Christmas
    now. And if you come back without anything, I&rsquo;ll blessed soon put you
    out of your misery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith came back with about four pounds of shortbread and as much various
    tucker as they could conveniently carry; a pretty good suit of cast-off tweeds;
    a new pair of &rsquo;lastic-sides from the store stock; two bottles of patent
    medicine and a black bottle half-full of home-made consumption-cure; also
    a letter to a hospital-committee man, and three shillings to help him on
    his way to Palmerston. He also got about half a mile of sympathy, religious
    consolation, and medical advice which he didn&rsquo;t remember.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i>,&rdquo; he said, triumphantly, &ldquo;am I a mug or not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman kindly ignored the question. &ldquo;I <i>did</i> have a better
    opinion of the Scotch,&rdquo; he said, contemptuously.</p>
  <p>Steelman got on at an hotel as billiard-marker and decoy, and in six months
    he managed that pub. Smith, who&rsquo;d been away on his own account, turned
    up in the town one day clean broke, and in a deplorable state. He heard of
    Steelman&rsquo;s luck, and thought he was &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; so went
    to his old friend.</p>
  <p>Cold type&mdash;or any other kind of type&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t do justice
    to Steelman&rsquo;s disgust. To think that this was the reward of all the
    time and trouble he&rsquo;d spent on Smith&rsquo;s education! However, when
    he cooled down, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smith, you&rsquo;re a young man yet, and it&rsquo;s never too late
    to mend. There is still time for reformation. I can&rsquo;t help you now;
    it would only demoralize you altogether. To think, after the way I trained
    you, you can&rsquo;t battle round any better&rsquo;n this! I always thought
    you were an irreclaimable mug, but I expected better things of you towards
    the end. I thought I&rsquo;d make <i>something</i> of you. It&rsquo;s enough
    to dishearten any man and disgust him with the world. Why! you ought to be
    a rich man now with the chances and training you had! To think&mdash;but
    I won&rsquo;t talk of that; it has made me ill. I suppose I&rsquo;ll have
    to give you something, if it&rsquo;s only to get rid of the sight of you.
    Here&rsquo;s a quid, and I&rsquo;m a mug for giving it to you. It&rsquo;ll
    do you more harm than good; and it ain&rsquo;t a friendly thing nor the right
    thing for me&mdash;who always had your welfare at heart&mdash;to give it
    to you under the circumstances. Now, get away out of my sight, and don&rsquo;t
    come near me till you&rsquo;ve reformed. If you do, I&rsquo;ll have to stoush
    you out of regard for my own health and feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Steelman came down in the world again and picked up Smith on the road,
    and they battled round together for another year or so; and at last they
    were in Wellington&mdash;Steelman &ldquo;flush&rdquo; and stopping at an
    hotel, and Smith stumped, as usual, and staying with a friend. One night
    they were drinking together at the hotel, at the expense of some mugs whom
    Steelman was &ldquo;educating.&rdquo; It was raining hard. When Smith was
    going home, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Steely, old man. Listen to the rain! I&rsquo;ll get wringing
    wet going home. You might as well lend me your overcoat to-night. You won&rsquo;t
    want it, and I won&rsquo;t hurt it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, Steelman&rsquo;s heart being warmed by his successes, he lent the overcoat.</p>
  <p>Smith went and pawned it, got glorious on the proceeds, and took the pawn-ticket
    to Steelman next day.</p>
  <p>Smith had reformed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnUnfinishedLoveStory"></a>An Unfinished Love Story</b></h2>
  <p>Brook let down the heavy, awkward sliprails, and the gaunt cattle stumbled
    through, with aggravating deliberation, and scattered slowly among the native
    apple-trees along the sidling. First there came an old easygoing red poley
    cow, then a dusty white cow; then two shaggy, half-grown calves&mdash;who
    seemed already to have lost all interest in existence&mdash;and after them
    a couple of &ldquo;babies,&rdquo; sleek, glossy, and cheerful; then three
    more tired-looking cows, with ragged udders and hollow sides; then a lanky
    barren heifer&mdash;red, of course&mdash;with half-blind eyes and one crooked
    horn&mdash;she was noted for her great agility in jumping two-rail fences,
    and she was known to the selector as &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth;&rdquo; and behind
    her came a young cream-coloured milker&mdash;a mighty proud and contented
    young mother&mdash;painfully and patiently dragging her first calf, which
    was hanging obstinately to a teat, with its head beneath her hind legs. Last
    of all there came the inevitable red steer, who scratched the dust and let
    a stupid &ldquo;bwoo-ur-r-rr&rdquo; out of him as he snuffed at the rails.</p>
  <p>Brook had shifted the rails there often before&mdash;fifteen years ago&mdash;perhaps
    the selfsame rails, for stringy-bark lasts long; and the action brought the
    past near to him&mdash;nearer than he wished. He did not like to think of
    that hungry, wretched selection existence; he felt more contempt than pity
    for the old-fashioned, unhappy boy, who used to let down the rails there,
    and drive the cattle through.</p>
  <p>He had spent those fifteen years in cities, and had come here, prompted
    more by curiosity than anything else, to have a quiet holiday. His father
    was dead; his other relations had moved away, leaving a tenant on the old
    selection.</p>
  <p>Brook rested his elbow on the top rail of an adjacent panel and watched
    the cattle pass, and thought until Lizzie&mdash;the tenant&rsquo;s niece&mdash;shoved
    the red steer through and stood gravely regarding him (Brook, and not the
    steer); then he shifted his back to the fence and looked at her. He had not
    much to look at: a short, plain, thin girl of nineteen, with rather vacant
    grey eyes, dark ringlets, and freckles; she had no complexion to speak of;
    she wore an ill-fitting print frock, and a pair of men&rsquo;s &rsquo;lastic-sides
    several sizes too large for her. She was &ldquo;studying for a school-teacher;&rdquo; that
    was the height of the ambition of local youth. Brook was studying her.</p>
  <p>He turned away to put up the rails. The lower rail went into its place all
    right, but the top one had got jammed, and it stuck as though it was spiked.
    He worked the rail up and down and to and fro, took it under his arm and
    tugged it; but he might as well have pulled at one of the posts. Then he
    lifted the loose end as high as he could, and let it fall&mdash;jumping back
    out of the way at the same time; this loosened it, but when he lifted it
    again it slid so easily and far into its socket that the other end came out
    and fell, barking Brook&rsquo;s knee. He swore a little, then tackled the
    rail again; he had the same trouble as before with the other end, but succeeded
    at last. Then he turned away, rubbing his knee.</p>
  <p>Lizzie hadn&rsquo;t smiled, not once; she watched him gravely all the while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hurt your knee?&rdquo; she asked, without emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. The rail did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reflected solemnly for a while, and then asked him if it felt sore.</p>
  <p>He replied rather briefly in the negative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They were always nasty, awkward rails to put up,&rdquo; she remarked,
    after some more reflection.</p>
  <p>Brook agreed, and then they turned their faces towards the homestead. Half-way
    down the sidling was a clump of saplings, with a big log lying amongst them.
    Here Brook paused. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sit down for a while and have a rest,&rdquo; said
    he.  &ldquo;Sit down, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She obeyed with the greatest of gravity. Nothing was said for awhile. She
    sat with her hands folded in her lap, gazing thoughtfully at the ridge, which
    was growing dim. It looked better when it was dim, and so did the rest of
    the scenery. There was no beauty lost when darkness hid the scenery altogether.
    Brook wondered what the girl was thinking about. The silence between them
    did not seem awkward, somehow; but it didn&rsquo;t suit him just then, and
    so presently he broke it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I must go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She thought awhile, and then she asked him if he was glad to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Are you sorry, Lizzie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She thought a good long while, and then she said she was.</p>
  <p>He moved closer to the girl, and suddenly slipped his arm round her waist.
    She did not seem agitated; she still gazed dreamily at the line of ridges,
    but her head inclined slightly towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lizzie, did you ever love anyone?&rdquo;&mdash;then anticipating
    the usual reply&mdash;&ldquo;except, of course, your father and mother, and
    all that sort of thing.&rdquo; Then, abruptly:  &ldquo;I mean did you ever
    have a sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reflected, so as to be sure; then she said she hadn&rsquo;t. Long pause,
    and he, the city man, breathed hard&mdash;not the girl. Suddenly he moved
    nervously, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lizzie&mdash;Lizzie! Do you know what love means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She pondered over this for some minutes, as a result of which she said she
    thought that she did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lizzie! Do you think you can love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She didn&rsquo;t seem able to find an answer to that. So he caught her to
    him in both arms, and kissed her hard and long on the mouth. She was agitated
    now&mdash;he had some complexion now; she struggled to her feet, trembling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must go now,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;They will be waiting
    for tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stood up before her, and held her there by both hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is plenty of time. Lizzie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mis-ter Br-o-o-k-er! Li-i-z-zee-e-e! Come ter yer tea-e-e!&rdquo; yelled
    a boy from the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must really go now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they can wait a minute. Lizzie, don&rsquo;t be frightened&rdquo;&mdash;bending
    his head&mdash;&ldquo;Lizzie, put your arms round my neck and kiss me&mdash;now.
    Do as I tell you, Lizzie&mdash;they cannot see us,&rdquo; and he drew her
    behind a bush. &ldquo;Now, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She obeyed just as a frightened child might.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must go now,&rdquo; she panted, breathless from such an embrace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lizzie, you will come for a walk with me after tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I can&rsquo;t promise. I don&rsquo;t think
    it would be right. Aunt mightn&rsquo;t like me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind aunt. I&rsquo;ll fix her. We&rsquo;ll go for a walk over
    to the school-teacher&rsquo;s place. It will be bright moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to promise. My father and mother might not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what are you frightened of? What harm is there in it?&rdquo; Then,
    softly, &ldquo;Promise, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Promise, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was hesitating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Promise, Lizzie. I&rsquo;m going away to-morrow&mdash;might never
    see you again. You will come, Lizzie? It will be our last talk together.
    Promise, Lizzie.... Oh, then, if you don&rsquo;t like to, I won&rsquo;t press
    you.... Will you come, or no?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One more, and I&rsquo;ll take you home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was nearly dark.</p>
  <p>Brook was moved to get up early next morning and give the girl a hand with
    the cows. There were two rickety bails in the yard. He had not forgotten
    how to milk, but the occupation gave him no pleasure&mdash;it brought the
    past near again.</p>
  <p>Now and then he would turn his face, rest his head against the side of the
    cow, and watch Lizzie at her work; and each time she would, as though in
    obedience to an influence she could not resist, turn her face to him&mdash;having
    noted the pause in his milking. There was a wonder in her expression&mdash;as
    if something had come into her life which she could not realize&mdash;curiosity
    in his.</p>
  <p>When the spare pail was full, he would follow her with it to the little
    bark dairy; and she held out the cloth which served as a strainer whilst
    he poured the milk in, and, as the last drops went through, their mouths
    would come together.</p>
  <p>He carried the slop-buckets to the pigsty for her, and helped to poddy (hand
    feed) a young calf. He had to grip the calf by the nape of the neck, insert
    a forefinger in its mouth, and force its nose down into an oil-drum full
    of skim milk. The calf sucked, thinking it had a teat; and so it was taught
    to drink. But calves have a habit, born of instinct, of butting the udders
    with their noses, by way of reminding their mothers to let down the milk;
    and so this calf butted at times, splashing sour milk over Brook, and barking
    his wrist against the sharp edge of the drum. Then he would swear a little,
    and Lizzie would smile sadly and gravely.</p>
  <p>Brook did not go away that day, nor the next, but he took the coach on the
    third day thereafter. He and Lizzie found a quiet corner to say good-bye
    in. She showed some emotion for the first time, or, perhaps, the second&mdash;maybe
    the third time&mdash;in that week of her life. They had been out together
    in the moonlight every evening. (Brook had been fifteen years in cities.)
    They had scarcely looked at each other that morning&mdash;and scarcely spoken.</p>
  <p>He looked back as the coach started and saw her sitting inside the big kitchen
    window. She waved her hand&mdash;hopelessly it seemed. She had rolled up
    her sleeve, and to Brook the arm seemed strangely white and fair above the
    line of sunburn round the wrist. He hadn&rsquo;t noticed it before. Her face
    seemed fairer too, but, perhaps, it was only the effect of light and shade
    round that window.</p>
  <p>He looked back again, as the coach turned the corner of the fence, and was
    just in time to see her bury her face in her hands with a passionate gesture
    which did not seem natural to her.</p>
  <p>Brook reached the city next evening, and, &ldquo;after hours,&rdquo; he
    staggered in through a side entrance to the lighted parlour of a private
    bar.</p>
  <p>They say that Lizzie broke her heart that year, but, then, the world does
    not believe in such things nowadays.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BoardAndResidence"></a>Board And Residence</b></h2>
  <p>One o&rsquo;clock on Saturday. The unemployed&rsquo;s one o&rsquo;clock
    on Saturday! Nothing more can be done this week, so you drag yourself wearily
    and despairingly  &ldquo;home,&rdquo; with the cheerful prospect of a penniless
    Saturday afternoon and evening and the long horrible Australian-city Sunday
    to drag through. One of the landlady&rsquo;s clutch&mdash;and she <i>is</i> an
    old hen&mdash;opens the door, exclaims:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Careless!&rdquo; and grins. You wait an anxious minute, to
    postpone the disappointment which you feel by instinct is coming, and then
    ask hopelessly whether there are any letters for you.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing for you, Mr Careless.&rdquo; Then in answer
    to the unspoken question, &ldquo;The postman&rsquo;s been, but there&rsquo;s
    nothing for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You hang up your hat in the stuffy little passage, and start upstairs, when, &ldquo;Oh,
    Mr Careless, mother wants to know if you&rsquo;ve had yer dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You haven&rsquo;t, but you say you have. You are empty enough inside, but
    the emptiness is filled up, as it were, with the wrong sort of hungry vacancy&mdash;gnawing
    anxiety. You haven&rsquo;t any stomach for the warm, tasteless mess which
    has been &ldquo;kep&rsquo;  &rsquo;ot&rdquo; for you in a cold stove. You
    feel just physically tired enough to go to your room, lie down on the bed,
    and snatch twenty minutes&rsquo; rest from that terrible unemployed restlessness
    which, you know, is sure to drag you to your feet to pace the room or tramp
    the pavement even before your bodily weariness has nearly left you. So you
    start up the narrow, stuffy little flight of steps called the &ldquo;stairs.&rdquo; Three
    small doors open from the landing&mdash;a square place of about four feet
    by four. The first door is yours; it is open, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Decided odour of bedroom dust and fluff, damped and kneaded with cold soap-suds.
    Rear view of a girl covered with a damp, draggled, dirt-coloured skirt, which
    gapes at the waistband from the &ldquo;body,&rdquo; disclosing a good glimpse
    of soiled stays (ribs burst), and yawns behind over a decidedly dirty white
    petticoat, the slit of which last, as she reaches forward and backs out convulsively,
    half opens and then comes together in an unsatisfactory, startling, tantalizing
    way, and allows a hint of a red flannel under-something. The frayed ends
    of the skirt lie across a hopelessly-burst pair of elastic-sides which rest
    on their inner edges&mdash;toes out&mdash;and jerk about in a seemingly undecided
    manner. She is damping and working up the natural layer on the floor with
    a piece of old flannel petticoat dipped occasionally in a bucket which stands
    by her side, containing about a quart of muddy water. She looks round and
    exclaims, &ldquo;Oh, did you want to come in, Mr Careless?&rdquo; Then she
    says she&rsquo;ll be done in a minute; furthermore she remarks that if you
    want to come in you won&rsquo;t be in her road. You don&rsquo;t&mdash;you
    go down to the dining-room&mdash;parlour&mdash;sitting-room&mdash;nursery&mdash;and
    stretch yourself on the sofa in the face of the painfully-evident disapproval
    of the landlady.</p>
  <p>You have been here, say, three months, and are only about two weeks behind.
    The landlady still says, &ldquo;Good morning, Mr Careless,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good
    evening, Mr Careless,&rdquo; but there is an unpleasant accent on the &ldquo;Mr,&rdquo; and
    a still more unpleasantly pronounced stress on the &ldquo;morning&rdquo; or &ldquo;evening.&rdquo; While
    your money lasted you paid up well and regularly&mdash;sometimes in advance&mdash;and
    dined out most of the time; but that doesn&rsquo;t count now.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes pass, and then the landlady&rsquo;s disapproval becomes manifest
    and aggressive. One of the little girls, a sharp-faced little larrikiness,
    who always wears a furtive grin of cunning&mdash;it seems as though it were
    born with her, and is perhaps more a misfortune than a fault&mdash;comes
    in and says please she wants to tidy up.</p>
  <p>So you get up and take your hat and go out again to look for a place to
    rest in&mdash;to try not to think.</p>
  <p>You <i>wish</i> you could get away up-country. You also wish you were dead.</p>
  <p>The landlady, Mrs Jones, is a widow, or grass-widow, Welsh, of course, and
    clannish; flat face, watery grey eyes, shallow, selfish, ignorant, and a
    hypocrite unconsciously&mdash;by instinct.</p>
  <p>But the worst of it is that Mrs Jones takes advantage of the situation to
    corner you in the passage when you want to get out, or when you come in tired,
    and talk. It amounts to about this: She has been fourteen years in this street,
    taking in boarders; everybody knows her; everybody knows Mrs Jones; her poor
    husband died six years ago (God rest his soul); she finds it hard to get
    a living these times; work, work, morning, noon, and night (talk, talk, talk,
    more likely). &ldquo;Do you know Mr Duff of the Labour Bureau?&rdquo; He
    has known her family for years; a very nice gentleman&mdash;a very nice gentleman
    indeed; he often stops at the gate to have a yarn with her on his way to
    the office (he must be hard up for a yarn). She doesn&rsquo;t know hardly
    nobody in this street; she never gossips; it takes her all her time to get
    a living; she can&rsquo;t be bothered with neighbours; it&rsquo;s always
    best to keep to yourself and keep neighbours at a distance. Would you believe
    it, Mr Careless, she has been two years in this house and hasn&rsquo;t said
    above a dozen words to the woman next door; she&rsquo;d just know her by
    sight if she saw her; as for the other woman she wouldn&rsquo;t know her
    from a crow. Mr Blank and Mrs Blank could tell you the same.... She always
    had gentlemen staying with her; she never had no cause to complain of one
    of them except once; they always treated her fair and honest. Here follows
    story about the exception; he, I gathered, was a journalist, and she could
    never depend on him. He seemed, from her statements, to have been decidedly
    erratic in his movements, mode of life and choice of climes. He evidently
    caused her a great deal of trouble and anxiety, and I felt a kind of sneaking
    sympathy for his memory. One young fellow stayed with her five years; he
    was, etc. She couldn&rsquo;t be hard on any young fellow that gets out of
    work; of course if he can&rsquo;t get it he can&rsquo;t pay; she can&rsquo;t
    get blood out of a stone; she couldn&rsquo;t turn him out in the street. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got sons of my own, Mr Careless, I&rsquo;ve got sons of my own.&rdquo;...
    She is sure she always does her best to make her boarders comfortable, and
    if they want anything they&rsquo;ve only got to ask for it. The kettle is
    always on the stove if you want a cup of tea, and if you come home late at
    night and want a bit of supper you&rsquo;ve only got to go to the safe (which
    of us would dare?). She never locks it, she never did.... And then she begins
    about her wonderful kids, and it goes on hour after hour. Lord! it&rsquo;s
    enough to drive a man mad.</p>
  <p>We were recommended to this place on the day of our arrival by a young dealer
    in the furniture line, whose name was Moses&mdash;and he looked like it,
    but we didn&rsquo;t think of that at the time. He had Mrs Jones&rsquo;s card
    in his window, and he left the shop in charge of his missus and came round
    with us at once. He assured us that we couldn&rsquo;t do better than stay
    with her. He said she was a most respectable lady, and all her boarders were
    decent young fellows&mdash;gentlemen; she kept everything scrupulously clean, and
    kept the best table in town, and she&rsquo;d do for us (washing included)
    for eighteen shillings per week; she generally took the first week in advance.
    We asked him to have a beer&mdash;for the want of somebody else to ask&mdash;and
    after that he said that Mrs Jones was a kind, motherly body, and understood
    young fellows; and that we&rsquo;d be even more comfortable than in our own
    home; that we&rsquo;d be allowed to do as we liked&mdash;she wasn&rsquo;t
    particular; she wouldn&rsquo;t mind it a bit if we came home late once in
    a way&mdash;she was used to that, in fact; she liked to see young fellows
    enjoying themselves. We afterwards found out that he got so much on every
    boarder he captured. We also found out&mdash;after paying in advance&mdash;that
    her gentlemen generally sent out their white things to be done; she only
    did the coloured things, so we had to pay a couple of bob extra a week to
    have our &ldquo;biled&rdquo; rags and collars sent out and done; and after
    the first week they bore sad evidence of having been done on the premises
    by one of the frowsy daughters. But we paid all the same. And, good Lord!
    if she keeps the best table in town, we are curious to see the worst. When
    you go down to breakfast you find on the table in front of your chair a cold
    plate, with a black something&mdash;God knows what it looks like&mdash;in
    the centre of it. It eats like something scraped off the inside of a hide
    and burnt; and with this you have a cup of warm grey slush called a &ldquo;cup
    of tea.&rdquo; Dinner: A slice of alleged roast beef or boiled mutton, of
    no particular colour or taste; three new spuds, of which the largest is about
    the size of an ordinary hen&rsquo;s egg, the smallest that of a bantam&rsquo;s,
    and the middle one in between, and which eat soggy and have no taste to speak
    of, save that they are a trifle bitter; a dab of unhealthy-looking green
    something, which might be either cabbage leaves or turnip-tops, and a glass
    of water. The whole mess is lukewarm, including the water&mdash;it would
    all be better cold. Tea: A thin slice of the aforesaid alleged roast or mutton,
    and the pick of about six thin slices of stale bread&mdash;evidently cut
    the day before yesterday. This is the way Mrs Jones  &ldquo;does&rdquo; for
    us for eighteen shillings a week. The bread gave out at tea-time this evening,
    and a mild financial boarder tapped his plate with his knife, and sent the
    bread plate out to be replenished. It came back with <i>one</i> slice on
    it.</p>
  <p>The mild financial boarder, with desperate courage, is telling the landlady
    that he&rsquo;ll have to shift next week&mdash;it is too far to go to work,
    he cannot always get down in time; he is very sorry he has to go, he says;
    he is very comfortable here, but it can&rsquo;t be helped; anyway, as soon
    as he can get work nearer, he&rsquo;ll come back at once; also (oh, what
    cowards men are when women are concerned), he says he wishes she could shift
    and take a house down at the other end of the town. She says (at least here
    are some fragments of her gabble which we caught and shorthanded):  &ldquo;Well,
    I&rsquo;m very sorry to lose you, Mr Sampson, very sorry indeed; but of course
    if you must go, you must. Of course you can&rsquo;t be expected to walk that
    distance every morning, and you mustn&rsquo;t be getting to work late, and
    losing your place... Of course we could get breakfast an hour earlier if...
    well, as I said before, I&rsquo;m sorry to lose you and, indeed... You won&rsquo;t
    forget to come and see us... glad to see you at any time... Well, any way,
    if you ever want to come back, you know, your bed will be always ready for
    you, and you&rsquo;ll be treated just the same, and made just as comfortable&mdash;you
    won&rsquo;t forget that&rdquo; (he says he won&rsquo;t); &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t
    forget to come to dinner sometimes&rdquo; (he says he won&rsquo;t); &ldquo;and,
    of course... You know I always try... Don&rsquo;t forget to drop in sometimes...
    Well, anyway, if you ever do happen to hear of a decent young fellow who
    wants a good, clean, comfortable home, you&rsquo;ll be sure to send him to
    me, will you?&rdquo; (He says he will.) &ldquo;Well, of course, Mr Sampson,
    etc., etc., etc., and-so-on, and-so-on, and-so-on, and-so-on,...&rdquo; It&rsquo;s
    enough to give a man rats.</p>
  <p>He escapes, and we regard his departure very much as a gang of hopeless
    convicts might regard the unexpected liberation of one of their number.</p>
  <p>This is the sort of life that gives a man a God-Almighty longing to break
    away and take to the bush.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HisColonialOath"></a>His Colonial Oath</b></h2>
  <p>I lately met an old schoolmate of mine up-country. He was much changed.
    He was tall and lank, and had the most hideous bristly red beard I ever saw.
    He was working on his father&rsquo;s farm. He shook hands, looked anywhere
    but in my face&mdash;and said nothing. Presently I remarked at a venture &ldquo;So
    poor old Mr B., the schoolmaster, is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was a good old sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Time goes by pretty quick, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His oath (colonial).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor old Mr B. died awfully sudden, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked up the hill, and said: &ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he added: &ldquo;My blooming oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought, perhaps, my city rig or manner embarrassed him, so I stuck my
    hands in my pockets, spat, and said, to set him at his ease: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    blanky hot to-day. I don&rsquo;t know how you blanky blanks stand such blank
    weather! It&rsquo;s blanky well hot enough to roast a crimson carnal bullock;
    ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Then I took out a cake of tobacco, bit off a quarter,
    and pretended to chew. He replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The conversation flagged here. But presently, to my great surprise, he came
    to the rescue with:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He finished me, yer know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finished? How? Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked down towards the river, thought (if he did think) and said:  &ldquo;Finished
    me edyercation, yer know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you mean Mr B.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath&mdash;he finished me first-rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He turned out a good many scholars, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; about going down to the trainin&rsquo; school.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to&mdash;I would if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those were good old times,&rdquo; I hazarded, &ldquo;you remember
    the old bark school?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked away across the sidling, and was evidently getting uneasy. He
    shifted about, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I must be goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re pretty busy now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! So long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye. We must have a yarn some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He got away as quickly as he could.</p>
  <p>I wonder whether he <i>was</i> changed after all&mdash;or, was it I? A man
    does seem to get out of touch with the bush after living in cities for eight
    or ten years.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SomeDay"></a>&ldquo;Some Day&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The two travellers had yarned late in their camp, and the moon was getting
    low down through the mulga. Mitchell&rsquo;s mate had just finished a rather
    racy yarn, but it seemed to fall flat on Mitchell&mdash;he was in a sentimental
    mood. He smoked a while, and thought, and then said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! there was one little girl that I was properly struck on. She
    came to our place on a visit to my sister. I think she was the best little
    girl that ever lived, and about the prettiest. She was just eighteen, and
    didn&rsquo;t come up to my shoulder; the biggest blue eyes you ever saw,
    and she had hair that reached down to her knees, and so thick you couldn&rsquo;t
    span it with your two hands&mdash;brown and glossy&mdash;and her skin with
    like lilies and roses. Of course, I never thought she&rsquo;d look at a rough,
    ugly, ignorant brute like me, and I used to keep out of her way and act a
    little stiff towards her; I didn&rsquo;t want the others to think I was gone
    on her, because I knew they&rsquo;d laugh at me, and maybe she&rsquo;d laugh
    at me more than all. She would come and talk to me, and sit near me at table;
    but I thought that that was on account of her good nature, and she pitied
    me because I was such a rough, awkward chap. I was gone on that girl, and
    no joking; and I felt quite proud to think she was a countrywoman of mine.
    But I wouldn&rsquo;t let her know that, for I felt sure she&rsquo;d only
    laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, things went on till I got the offer of two or three years&rsquo; work
    on a station up near the border, and I had to go, for I was hard up; besides,
    I wanted to get away. Stopping round where she was only made me miserable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The night I left they were all down at the station to see me off&mdash;including
    the girl I was gone on. When the train was ready to start she was standing
    away by herself on the dark end of the platform, and my sister kept nudging
    me and winking, and fooling about, but I didn&rsquo;t know what she was driving
    at. At last she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go and speak to her, you noodle; go and say good-bye to Edie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I went up to where she was, and, when the others turned their
    backs&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, good-bye, Miss Brown,&rsquo; I said, holding out my
    hand; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll ever see you again, for Lord
    knows when I&rsquo;ll be back. Thank you for coming to see me off.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just then she turned her face to the light, and I saw she was crying.
    She was trembling all over. Suddenly she said, &lsquo;Jack! Jack!&rsquo; just
    like that, and held up her arms like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell was speaking in a tone of voice that didn&rsquo;t belong to him,
    and his mate looked up. Mitchell&rsquo;s face was solemn, and his eyes were
    fixed on the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you gave her a good hug then, and a kiss?&rdquo; asked
    the mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so,&rdquo; snapped Mitchell. &ldquo;There is some
    things a man doesn&rsquo;t want to joke about.... Well, I think we&rsquo;ll
    shove on one of the billies, and have a drink of tea before we turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, as they drank their
    tea, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll go back and marry her some day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some day! That&rsquo;s it; it looks like it, doesn&rsquo;t it? We
    all say, &lsquo;Some day.&rsquo; I used to say it ten years ago, and look
    at me now. I&rsquo;ve been knocking round for five years, and the last two
    years constant on the track, and no show of getting off it unless I go for
    good, and what have I got for it? I look like going home and getting married,
    without a penny in my pocket or a rag to my back scarcely, and no show of
    getting them. I swore I&rsquo;d never go back home without a cheque, and,
    what&rsquo;s more, I never will; but the cheque days are past. Look at that
    boot! If we were down among the settled districts we&rsquo;d be called tramps
    and beggars; and what&rsquo;s the difference? I&rsquo;ve been a fool, I know,
    but I&rsquo;ve paid for it; and now there&rsquo;s nothing for it but to tramp,
    tramp, tramp for your tucker, and keep tramping till you get old and careless
    and dirty, and older, and more careless and dirtier, and you get used to
    the dust and sand, and heat, and flies, and mosquitoes, just as a bullock
    does, and lose ambition and hope, and get contented with this animal life,
    like a dog, and till your swag seems part of yourself, and you&rsquo;d be
    lost and uneasy and light-shouldered without it, and you don&rsquo;t care
    a damn if you&rsquo;ll ever get work again, or live like a Christian; and
    you go on like this till the spirit of a bullock takes the place of the heart
    of a man. Who cares? If we hadn&rsquo;t found the track yesterday we might
    have lain and rotted in that lignum, and no one been any the wiser&mdash;or
    sorrier&mdash;who knows? Somebody might have found us in the end, but it
    mightn&rsquo;t have been worth his while to go out of his way and report
    us. Damn the world, say I!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He smoked for a while in savage silence; then he knocked the ashes out of
    his pipe, felt for his tobacco with a sigh, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I am a bit out of sorts to-night. I&rsquo;ve been thinking....
    I think we&rsquo;d best turn in, old man; we&rsquo;ve got a long, dry stretch
    before us to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They rolled out their swags on the sand, lay down, and wrapped themselves
    in their blankets. Mitchell covered his face with a piece of calico, because
    the moonlight and wind kept him awake.</p>

    alone! I&rsquo;m telling you the truth, my my poor boy died of influenza
    last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ragged young rip gave a long, low whistle, glanced up and down Jones&rsquo;s
    Alley, spat out some tobacco-juice, and said &ldquo;Swelp me Gord! I&rsquo;m
    sorry, mum. I didn&rsquo;t know. How was I to know you wasn&rsquo;t havin&rsquo; me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00108-images/page210.jpg" width="850" height="572"></p>
  <p>He withdrew one hand from his pocket and scratched the back of his head,
    tilting his hat as far forward as it had previously been to the rear, and
    just then the dilapidated side of his right boot attracted his attention.
    He turned the foot on one side, and squinted at the sole; then he raised
    the foot to his left knee, caught the ankle in a very dirty hand, and regarded
    the sole-leather critically, as though calculating how long it would last.
    After which he spat desperately at the pavement, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kin I see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He followed her up the crooked little staircase with a who&rsquo;s-afraid
    kind of swagger, but he took his hat off on entering the room.</p>
  <p>He glanced round, and seemed to take stock of the signs of poverty&mdash;so
    familiar to his class&mdash;and then directed his gaze to where the body
    lay on the sofa with its pauper coffin already by its side. He looked at
    the coffin with the critical eye of a tradesman, then he looked at Arvie,
    and then at the coffin again, as if calculating whether the body would fit.</p>
  <p>The mother uncovered the white, pinched face of the dead boy, and Bill came
    and stood by the sofa. He carelessly drew his right hand from his pocket,
    and laid the palm on Arvie&rsquo;s ice-cold forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor little cove!&rdquo; Bill muttered, half to himself; and then,
    as though ashamed of his weakness, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t no post mortem, was there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;a doctor saw him the day before&mdash;there
    was no post mortem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought there wasn&rsquo;t none,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;because
    a man that&rsquo;s been post mortemed always looks as if he&rsquo;d been
    hurt. My father looked right enough at first&mdash;just as if he was restin&rsquo;&mdash;but
    after they&rsquo;d had him opened he looked as if he&rsquo;d been hurt. No
    one else could see it, but I could. How old was Arvie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eleven.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m twelve&mdash;goin&rsquo; on for thirteen. Arvie&rsquo;s
    father&rsquo;s dead, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s mine. Died at his work, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;d mine. Arvie told me his father died of something with
    his heart!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;d mine; ain&rsquo;t it rum? You scrub offices an&rsquo; wash,
    don&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So does my mother. You find it pretty hard to get a livin&rsquo;,
    don&rsquo;t yer, these times?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God, yes! God only knows what I&rsquo;ll do now my poor boy&rsquo;s
    gone. I generally get up at half-past five to scrub out some offices, and
    when that&rsquo;s done I&rsquo;ve got to start my day&rsquo;s work, washing.
    And then I find it hard to make both ends meet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So does my mother. I suppose you took on bad when yer husband was
    brought home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, my God! Yes. I&rsquo;ll never forget it till my dying day. My
    poor husband had been out of work for weeks, and he only got the job two
    days before he died. I suppose it gave your mother a great shock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! One of the fellows that carried father home said: &lsquo;Yer
    husband&rsquo;s dead, mum,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;he dropped off all of a
    suddint,&rsquo; and mother said, &lsquo;My God! my God!&rsquo; just like
    that, and went off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor soul! poor soul! And&mdash;now my Arvie&rsquo;s gone. Whatever
    will me and the children do? Whatever will I do? Whatever will I do? My God!
    I wish I was under the turf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer up, mum!&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use frettin&rsquo; over
    what&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He wiped some tobacco-juice off his lips with the back of his hand, and
    regarded the stains reflectively for a minute or so. Then he looked at Arvie
    again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should ha&rsquo; tried cod liver oil,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He needed rest and plenty of good food.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t very strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, he was not, poor boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought he wasn&rsquo;t. They treated him bad at Grinder Brothers:
    they didn&rsquo;t give him a show to learn nothing; kept him at the same
    work all the time, and he didn&rsquo;t have cheek enough to arsk the boss
    for a rise, lest he&rsquo;d be sacked. He couldn&rsquo;t fight, an&rsquo; the
    boys used to tease him; they&rsquo;d wait outside the shop to have a lark
    with Arvie. I&rsquo;d like to see &rsquo;em do it to me. He couldn&rsquo;t
    fight; but then, of course, he wasn&rsquo;t strong. They don&rsquo;t bother
    me while I&rsquo;m strong enough to heave a rock; but then, of course, it
    wasn&rsquo;t Arvie&rsquo;s fault. I s&rsquo;pose he had pluck enough, if
    he hadn&rsquo;t the strength.&rdquo; And Bill regarded the corpse with a
    fatherly and lenient eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d known this, I&rsquo;d
    sooner have starved than have my poor boy&rsquo;s life tormented out of him
    in such a place. He never complained. My poor, brave-hearted child! He never
    complained! Poor little Arvie! Poor little Arvie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never told yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;never a word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! You don&rsquo;t say so! P&rsquo;raps he didn&rsquo;t want
    to let you know he couldn&rsquo;t hold his own; but that wasn&rsquo;t his
    fault, I s&rsquo;pose. Y&rsquo;see, he wasn&rsquo;t strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An old print hanging over the bed attracted his attention, and he regarded
    it with critical interest for awhile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a pickcher like that at home. We lived in Jones&rsquo;s
    Alley wunst&mdash;in that house over there. How d&rsquo;yer like livin&rsquo; in
    Jones&rsquo;s Alley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it at all. I don&rsquo;t like having to bring
    my children up where there are so many bad houses; but I can&rsquo;t afford
    to go somewhere else and pay higher rent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, there <i>is</i> a good many night-shops round here. But then,&rdquo;  he
    added, reflectively, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find them everywheres. An&rsquo;,
    besides, the kids git sharp, an&rsquo; pick up a good deal in an alley like
    this; &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t do &rsquo;em no harm; it&rsquo;s no use kids bein&rsquo; green
    if they wanter get on in a city. You ain&rsquo;t been in Sydney all yer life,
    have yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. We came from the bush, about five years ago. My poor husband
    thought he could do better in the city. I was brought up in the bush.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought yer was. Well, men are sick fools. I&rsquo;m thinking about
    gittin&rsquo;  a billet up-country, myself, soon. Where&rsquo;s he goin&rsquo; ter
    be buried?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At Rookwood, to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I carn&rsquo;t come. I&rsquo;ve got ter work. Is the Guvmint goin&rsquo; to
    bury him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill looked at the body with increased respect. &ldquo;Kin I do anythin&rsquo;  for
    you? Now, don&rsquo;t be frightened to arsk!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Thank you very much, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I must be goin&rsquo;; thank yer fur yer trouble, mum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No trouble, my boy&mdash;mind the step.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> gone. I&rsquo;ll bring a piece of board round some night
    and mend it for you, if you like; I&rsquo;m learnin&rsquo; the carpenterin&rsquo;;
    I kin nearly make a door. Tell yer what, I&rsquo;ll send the old woman round
    to-night to fix up Arvie and lend yer a hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I suppose your mother&rsquo;s got work and trouble
    enough; I&rsquo;ll manage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send her round, anyway; she&rsquo;s a bit rough, but she&rsquo;s
    got a soft gizzard; an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; she enjoys better
    than fixin&rsquo; up a body. Good-bye, mum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused at the door, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, mum. Swelp me God! I&rsquo;m sorry. S&rsquo;long,
    an&rsquo; thank yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An awe-stricken child stood on the step, staring at Bill with great brimming
    eyes. He patted it on the head and said &ldquo;Keep yer pecker up, young &rsquo;un!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="InAWetSeason"></a>In A Wet Season</b></h2>
  <p>It was raining&mdash;&ldquo;general rain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The train left Bourke, and then there began the long, long agony of scrub
    and wire fence, with here and there a natural clearing, which seemed even
    more dismal than the funereal &ldquo;timber&rdquo; itself. The only thing
    which might seem in keeping with one of these soddened flats would be the
    ghost of a funeral&mdash;a city funeral with plain hearse and string of cabs&mdash;going
    very slowly across from the scrub on one side to the scrub on the other.
    Sky like a wet, grey blanket; plains like dead seas, save for the tufts of
    coarse grass sticking up out of the water; scrub indescribably dismal&mdash;everything
    damp, dark, and unspeakably dreary.</p>
  <p>Somewhere along here we saw a swagman&rsquo;s camp&mdash;a square of calico
    stretched across a horizontal stick, some rags steaming on another stick
    in front of a fire, and two billies to the leeward of the blaze. We knew
    by instinct that there was a piece of beef in the larger one. Small, hopeless-looking
    man standing with his back to the fire, with his hands behind him, watching
    the train; also, a damp, sorry-looking dingo warming itself and shivering
    by the fire. The rain had held up for a while. We saw two or three similar
    camps further on, forming a temporary suburb of Byrock.</p>
  <p>The population was on the platform in old overcoats and damp, soft felt
    hats; one trooper in a waterproof. The population looked cheerfully and patiently
    dismal. The local push had evidently turned up to see off some fair enslavers
    from the city, who had been up-country for the cheque season, now over. They
    got into another carriage. We were glad when the bell rang.</p>
  <p>The rain recommenced. We saw another swagman about a mile on struggling
    away from the town, through mud and water. He did not seem to have heart
    enough to bother about trying to avoid the worst mud-holes. There was a low-spirited
    dingo at his heels, whose sole object in life was seemingly to keep his front
    paws in his master&rsquo;s last footprint. The traveller&rsquo;s body was
    bent well forward from the hips up; his long arms&mdash;about six inches
    through his coat sleeves&mdash;hung by his sides like the arms of a dummy,
    with a billy at the end of one and a bag at the end of the other; but his
    head was thrown back against the top end of the swag, his hat-brim rolled
    up in front, and we saw a ghastly, beardless face which turned neither to
    the right nor the left as the train passed him.</p>
  <p>After a long while we closed our book, and looking through the window, saw
    a hawker&rsquo;s turn-out which was too sorrowful for description.</p>
  <p>We looked out again while the train was going slowly, and saw a teamster&rsquo;s
    camp: three or four wagons covered with tarpaulins which hung down in the
    mud all round and suggested death. A long, narrow man, in a long, narrow,
    shoddy overcoat and a damp felt hat, was walking quickly along the road past
    the camp. A sort of cattle-dog glided silently and swiftly out from under
    a wagon, &ldquo;heeled&rdquo; the man, and slithered back without explaining.
    Here the scene vanished.</p>
  <p>We remember stopping&mdash;for an age it seemed&mdash;at half a dozen straggling
    shanties on a flat of mud and water. There was a rotten weather-board pub,
    with a low, dripping veranda, and three wretchedly forlorn horses hanging,
    in the rain, to a post outside. We saw no more, but we knew that there were
    several apologies for men hanging about the rickety bar inside&mdash;or round
    the parlour fire. Streams of cold, clay-coloured water ran in all directions,
    cutting fresh gutters, and raising a yeasty froth whenever the water fell
    a few inches. As we left, we saw a big man in an overcoat riding across a
    culvert; the tails of the coat spread over the horse&rsquo;s rump, and almost
    hid it. In fancy still we saw him&mdash;hanging up his weary, hungry little
    horse in the rain, and swaggering into the bar; and we almost heard someone
    say, in a drawling tone: &ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Tom! &rsquo;Ow are yer poppin&rsquo; up?&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>The train stopped (for about a year) within a mile of the next station.
    Trucking-yards in the foreground, like any other trucking-yard along the
    line; they looked drearier than usual, because the rain had darkened the
    posts and rails. Small plain beyond, covered with water and tufts of grass.
    The inevitable, God-forgotten  &ldquo;timber,&rdquo; black in the distance;
    dull, grey sky and misty rain over all. A small, dark-looking flock of sheep
    was crawling slowly in across the flat from the unknown, with three men on
    horse-back zigzagging patiently behind. The horses just moved&mdash;that
    was all. One man wore an oilskin, one an old tweed overcoat, and the third
    had a three-bushel bag over his head and shoulders.</p>
  <p>Had we returned an hour later, we should have seen the sheep huddled together
    in a corner of the yard, and the three horses hanging up outside the local
    shanty.</p>
  <p>We stayed at Nyngan&mdash;which place we refrain from sketching&mdash;for
    a few hours, because the five trucks of cattle of which we were in charge
    were shunted there, to be taken on by a very subsequent goods train. The
    Government allows one man to every five trucks in a cattle-train. We shall
    pay our fare next time, even if we have not a shilling left over and above.
    We had haunted local influence at Comanavadrink for two long, anxious, heart-breaking
    weeks ere we got the pass; and we had put up with all the indignities, the
    humiliation&mdash;in short, had suffered all that poor devils suffer whilst
    besieging Local Influence. We only thought of escaping from the bush.</p>
  <p>The pass said that we were John Smith, drover, and that we were available
    for return by ordinary passenger-train within two days, we think&mdash;or
    words in that direction. Which didn&rsquo;t interest us. We might have given
    the pass away to an unemployed in Orange, who wanted to go out back, and
    who begged for it with tears in his eyes; but we didn&rsquo;t like to injure
    a poor fool who never injured us&mdash;who was an entire stranger to us.
    He didn&rsquo;t know what Out Back meant.</p>
  <p>Local Influence had given us a kind of note of introduction to be delivered
    to the cattle-agent at the yards that morning; but the agent was not there&mdash;only
    two of his satellites, a Cockney colonial-experience man, and a scrub-town
    clerk, both of whom we kindly ignore. We got on without the note, and at
    Orange we amused ourself by reading it. It said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear Old Man&mdash;Please send this beggar on; and I hope he&rsquo;ll
    be landed safely at Orange&mdash;or&mdash;or wherever the cattle go&mdash;yours,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We had been led to believe that the bullocks were going to Sydney. We took
    no further interest in those cattle.</p>
  <p>After Nyngan the bush grew darker and drearier; and the plains more like
    ghastly oceans; and here and there the &ldquo;dominant note of Australian
    scenery&rdquo;  was accentuated, as it were, by naked, white, ring-barked
    trees standing in the water and haunting the ghostly surroundings.</p>
  <p>We spent that night in a passenger compartment of a van which had been originally
    attached to old No. 1 engine. There was only one damp cushion in the whole
    concern. We lent that to a lady who travelled for a few hours in the other
    half of the next compartment. The seats were about nine inches wide and sloped
    in at a sharp angle to the bare matchboard wall, with a bead on the outer
    edge; and as the cracks had become well caulked with the grease and dirt
    of generations, they held several gallons of water each. We scuttled one,
    rolled ourself in a rug, and tried to sleep; but all night long overcoated
    and comfortered bushmen would get in, let down all the windows, and then
    get out again at the next station. Then we would wake up frozen and shut
    the windows.</p>
  <p>We dozed off again, and woke at daylight, and recognized the ridgy gum-country
    between Dubbo and Orange. It didn&rsquo;t look any drearier than the country
    further west&mdash;because it couldn&rsquo;t. There is scarcely a part of
    the country out west which looks less inviting or more horrible than any
    other part.</p>
  <p>The weather cleared, and we had sunlight for Orange, Bathurst, the Blue
    Mountains, and Sydney. They deserve it; also as much rain as they need.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Rats"></a>&ldquo;Rats&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s two of them, and they&rsquo;re having a fight!
    Come on.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>It seemed a strange place for a fight&mdash;that hot, lonely, cotton-bush
    plain. And yet not more than half a mile ahead there were apparently two
    men struggling together on the track.</p>
  <p>The three travellers postponed their smoke-ho and hurried on. They were
    shearers&mdash;a little man and a big man, known respectively as &ldquo;Sunlight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Macquarie,&rdquo;  and
    a tall, thin, young jackeroo whom they called &ldquo;Milky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where the other man sprang from? I didn&rsquo;t see him
    before,&rdquo;  said Sunlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He muster bin layin&rsquo; down in the bushes,&rdquo; said Macquarie. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
    goin&rsquo; at it proper, too. Come on! Hurry up and see the fun!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They hurried on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny-lookin&rsquo; feller, the other feller,&rdquo; panted
    Milky. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t seem to have no head. Look! he&rsquo;s down&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    both down! They must ha&rsquo; clinched on the ground. No! they&rsquo;re
    up an&rsquo; at it again.... Why, good Lord! I think the other&rsquo;s a
    woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! so it is!&rdquo; yelled Sunlight. &ldquo;Look! the brute&rsquo;s
    got her down again! He&rsquo;s kickin&rsquo; her. Come on, chaps; come on,
    or he&rsquo;ll do for her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They dropped swags, water-bags and all, and raced forward; but presently
    Sunlight, who had the best eyes, slackened his pace and dropped behind. His
    mates glanced back at his face, saw a peculiar expression there, looked ahead
    again, and then dropped into a walk.</p>
  <p>They reached the scene of the trouble, and there stood a little withered
    old man by the track, with his arms folded close up under his chin; he was
    dressed mostly in calico patches; and half a dozen corks, suspended on bits
    of string from the brim of his hat, dangled before his bleared optics to
    scare away the flies. He was scowling malignantly at a stout, dumpy swag
    which lay in the middle of the track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, old Rats, what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; asked Sunlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing,&rdquo; answered the old man, without looking
    round.  &ldquo;I fell out with my swag, that&rsquo;s all. He knocked me down,
    but I&rsquo;ve settled him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; said Sunlight, winking at his mates, &ldquo;we
    saw you jump on him when he was down. That ain&rsquo;t fair, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t see it all,&rdquo; cried Rats, getting excited. &ldquo;He
    hit <i>me</i> down first! And look here, I&rsquo;ll fight him again for nothing,
    and you can see fair play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They talked awhile; then Sunlight proposed to second the swag, while his
    mate supported the old man, and after some persuasion, Milky agreed, for
    the sake of the lark, to act as time-keeper and referee.</p>
  <p>Rats entered into the spirit of the thing; he stripped to the waist, and
    while he was getting ready the travellers pretended to bet on the result.</p>
  <p>Macquarie took his place behind the old man, and Sunlight up-ended the swag.
    Rats shaped and danced round; then he rushed, feinted, ducked, retreated,
    darted in once more, and suddenly went down like a shot on the broad of his
    back. No actor could have done it better; he went down from that imaginary
    blow as if a cannon-ball had struck him in the forehead.</p>
  <p>Milky called time, and the old man came up, looking shaky. However, he got
    in a tremendous blow which knocked the swag into the bushes.</p>
  <p>Several rounds followed with varying success.</p>
  <p>The men pretended to get more and more excited, and betted freely; and Rats
    did his best. At last they got tired of the fun, Sunlight let the swag lie
    after Milky called time, and the jackaroo awarded the fight to Rats. They
    pretended to hand over the stakes, and then went back for their swags, while
    the old man put on his shirt.</p>
  <p>Then he calmed down, carried his swag to the side of the track, sat down
    on it and talked rationally about bush matters for a while; but presently
    he grew silent and began to feel his muscles and smile idiotically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you len&rsquo; us a bit o&rsquo; meat?&rdquo; said he suddenly.</p>
  <p>They spared him half a pound; but he said he didn&rsquo;t want it all, and
    cut off about an ounce, which he laid on the end of his swag. Then he took
    the lid off his billy and produced a fishing-line. He baited the hook, threw
    the line across the track, and waited for a bite. Soon he got deeply interested
    in the line, jerked it once or twice, and drew it in rapidly. The bait had
    been rubbed off in the grass. The old man regarded the hook disgustedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I had him, only I was in such
    a hurry. I should ha&rsquo; played him a little more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Next time he was more careful. He drew the line in warily, grabbed an imaginary
    fish and laid it down on the grass. Sunlight and Co. were greatly interested
    by this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot yer think o&rsquo; that?&rdquo; asked Rats. &ldquo;It weighs
    thirty pound if it weighs an ounce! Wot yer think o&rsquo; that for a cod?
    The hook&rsquo;s half-way down his blessed gullet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He caught several cod and a bream while they were there, and invited them
    to camp and have tea with him. But they wished to reach a certain shed next
    day, so&mdash;after the ancient had borrowed about a pound of meat for bait&mdash;they
    went on, and left him fishing contentedly.</p>
  <p>But first Sunlight went down into his pocket and came up with half a crown,
    which he gave to the old man, along with some tucker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
    best push on to the water before dark, old chap,&rdquo; he said, kindly.</p>
  <p>When they turned their heads again, Rats was still fishing but when they
    looked back for the last time before entering the timber, he was having another
    row with his swag; and Sunlight reckoned that the trouble arose out of some
    lies which the swag had been telling about the bigger fish it caught.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellACharacterSketch"></a>Mitchell: A Character Sketch</b></h2>
  <p>It was a very mean station, and Mitchell thought he had better go himself
    and beard the overseer for tucker. His mates were for waiting till the overseer
    went out on the run, and then trying their luck with the cook; but the self-assertive
    and diplomatic Mitchell decided to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said the manager.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    suppose it&rsquo;s any use asking you for a job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t ask you,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
    suppose you want any fencing done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor boundary-riding&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t likely to want a man to knock round?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought not. Things are pretty bad just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Na&mdash;yes&mdash;they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well; there&rsquo;s a lot to be said on the squatter&rsquo;s
    side as well as the men&rsquo;s. I suppose I can get a bit of rations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-yes.&rdquo; (<i>Shortly</i>)&mdash;&ldquo;Wot d&rsquo;yer want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see; we want a bit of meat and flour&mdash;I think
    that&rsquo;s all. Got enough tea and sugar to carry us on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Cook! have you got any meat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To Mitchell: &ldquo;Can you kill a sheep?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To the cook: &ldquo;Give this man a cloth and knife and steel, and let him
    go up to the yard and kill a sheep.&rdquo; (To Mitchell) &ldquo;You can take
    a fore-quarter and get a bit of flour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Half an hour later Mitchell came back with the carcass wrapped in the cloth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here yer are; here&rsquo;s your sheep,&rdquo; he said to the cook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    all right; hang it in there. Did you take a forequarter?&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you? The boss told you to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want a fore-quarter. I don&rsquo;t like it. I took
    a hind-quarter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So he had.</p>
  <p>The cook scratched his head; he seemed to have nothing to say. He thought
    about trying to think, perhaps, but gave it best. It was too hot and he was
    out of practice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, fill these up, will you?&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    the tea-bag, and that&rsquo;s the sugar-bag, and that&rsquo;s the flour-bag.&rdquo; He
    had taken them from the front of his shirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened to stretch &rsquo;em a little, old man.
    I&rsquo;ve got two mates to feed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cook took the bags mechanically and filled them well before he knew
    what he was doing. Mitchell talked all the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;got a bit of baking-powder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-yes, here you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. Find it dull here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, pretty dull. There&rsquo;s a bit of cooked beef and some
    bread and cake there, if you want it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Mitchell, sweeping the broken victuals into an
    old pillow-slip which he carried on his person for such an emergency. &ldquo;I
    s&rsquo;pose you find it dull round here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, pretty dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one to talk to much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not many.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tongue gets rusty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, so long, and thank yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; said the cook (he nearly added &ldquo;thank yer&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, good day; I&rsquo;ll see you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell shouldered his spoil and left.</p>
  <p>The cook scratched his head; he had a chat with the overseer afterwards,
    and they agreed that the traveller was a bit gone.</p>
  <p>But Mitchell&rsquo;s head wasn&rsquo;t gone&mdash;not much: he had been
    round a bit&mdash;that was all.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBushUndertaker"></a>The Bush Undertaker</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Five Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man shaded his eyes and peered through the dazzling glow of that
    broiling Christmas Day. He stood just within the door of a slab-and-bark
    hut situated upon the bank of a barren creek; sheep-yards lay to the right,
    and a low line of bare, brown ridges formed a suitable background to the
    scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five Bob!&rdquo; shouted he again; and a dusty sheep-dog rose wearily
    from the shaded side of the hut and looked inquiringly at his master, who
    pointed towards some sheep which were straggling from the flock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fetch &rsquo;em back,&rdquo; he said confidently.</p>
  <p>The dog went off, and his master returned to the interior of the hut.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em early,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;the
    super won&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em early, and have the arternoon
    to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get dinner,&rdquo; he added, glancing at some pots on
    the fire. &ldquo;I cud do a bit of doughboy, an&rsquo; that theer boggabri&rsquo;ll
    eat like tater-marrer along of the salt meat.&rdquo; He moved one of the
    black buckets from the blaze. &ldquo;I likes to keep it jist on the sizzle,&rdquo; he
    said in explanation to himself; &ldquo;hard bilin&rsquo; makes it tough&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    keep it jist a-simmerin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here his soliloquy was interrupted by the return of the dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Five Bob,&rdquo; said the hatter, &ldquo;dinner&rsquo;ll
    be ready dreckly. Jist keep yer eye on the sheep till I calls yer; keep &rsquo;em
    well rounded up, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em afterwards and have
    a holiday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This speech was accompanied by a gesture evidently intelligible, for the
    dog retired as though he understood English, and the cooking proceeded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a pick an&rsquo; shovel with me an&rsquo; root up
    that old blackfellow,&rdquo;  mused the shepherd, evidently following up
    a recent train of thought; &ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;ll do now. I&rsquo;ll
    put in the spuds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The last sentence referred to the cooking, the first to a blackfellow&rsquo;s
    grave about which he was curious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sheep&rsquo;s a-campin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the soliloquizer,
    glancing through the door. &ldquo;So me an&rsquo; Five Bob&rsquo;ll be able
    to get our dinner in peace. I wish I had just enough fat to make the pan
    siss; I&rsquo;d treat myself to a leather-jacket; but it took three weeks&rsquo; skimmin&rsquo; to
    get enough for them theer doughboys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In due time the dinner was dished up; and the old man seated himself on
    a block, with the lid of a gin-case across his knees for a table. Five Bob
    squatted opposite with the liveliest interest and appreciation depicted on
    his intelligent countenance.</p>
  <p>Dinner proceeded very quietly, except when the carver paused to ask the
    dog how some tasty morsel went with him, and Five Bob&rsquo;s tail declared
    that it went very well indeed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, try this,&rdquo; cried the old man, tossing him
    a large piece of doughboy. A click of Five Bob&rsquo;s jaws and the dough
    was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clean into his liver!&rdquo; said the old man with a faint smile.
    He washed up the tinware in the water the duff had been boiled in, and then,
    with the assistance of the dog, yarded the sheep.</p>
  <p>This accomplished, he took a pick and shovel and an old sack, and started
    out over the ridge, followed, of course, by his four-legged mate. After tramping
    some three miles he reached a spur, running out from the main ridge. At the
    extreme end of this, under some gum-trees, was a little mound of earth, barely
    defined in the grass, and indented in the centre as all blackfellows&rsquo; graves
    were.</p>
  <p>He set to work to dig it up, and sure enough, in about half an hour he bottomed
    on payable dirt.</p>
  <p>When he had raked up all the bones, he amused himself by putting them together
    on the grass and by speculating as to whether they had belonged to black
    or white, male or female. Failing, however, to arrive at any satisfactory
    conclusion, he dusted them with great care, put them in the bag, and started
    for home.</p>
  <p>He took a short cut this time over the ridge and down a gully which was
    full of ring-barked trees and long white grass. He had nearly reached its
    mouth when a great greasy black goanna clambered up a sapling from under
    his feet and looked fightable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dang the jumpt-up thing!&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;It &rsquo;gin
    me a start!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the foot of the sapling he espied an object which he at first thought
    was the blackened carcass of a sheep, but on closer examination discovered
    to be the body of a man; it lay with its forehead resting on its hands, dried
    to a mummy by the intense heat of the western summer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me luck&rsquo;s in for the day and no mistake!&rdquo; said the shepherd,
    scratching the back of his head, while he took stock of the remains. He picked
    up a stick and tapped the body on the shoulder; the flesh sounded like leather.
    He turned it over on its side; it fell flat on its back like a board, and
    the shrivelled eyes seemed to peer up at him from under the blackened wrists.</p>
  <p>He stepped back involuntarily, but, recovering himself, leant on his stick
    and took in all the ghastly details.</p>
  <p>There was nothing in the blackened features to tell aught of name or race,
    but the dress proclaimed the remains to be those of a European. The old man
    caught sight of a black bottle in the grass, close beside the corpse. This
    set him thinking. Presently he knelt down and examined the soles of the dead
    man&rsquo;s blucher boots, and then, rising with an air of conviction, exclaimed: &ldquo;Brummy!
    by gosh!&mdash;busted up at last!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tole yer so, Brummy,&rdquo; he said impressively, addressing the
    corpse.  &ldquo;I allers told yer as how it &rsquo;ud be&mdash;an&rsquo; here
    y&rsquo;are, you thundering jumpt-up cuss-o&rsquo;-God fool. Yer cud earn
    more&rsquo;n any man in the colony, but yer&rsquo;d lush it all away. I allers
    sed as how it &rsquo;ud end, an&rsquo; now yer kin see fur y&rsquo;self.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spect yer was a-comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; me t&rsquo; get fixt up an&rsquo; set
    straight agin; then yer was a-goin&rsquo; to swear off, same as yer &rsquo;allers
    did; an&rsquo; here y&rsquo;are, an&rsquo;  now I expect I&rsquo;ll have
    t&rsquo; fix yer up for the last time an&rsquo; make yer decent, for  &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t
    do t&rsquo; leave yer alyin&rsquo; out here like a dead sheep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He picked up the corked bottle and examined it. To his great surprise it
    was nearly full of rum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this gits me,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man; &ldquo;me luck&rsquo;s
    in, this Christmas, an&rsquo; no mistake. He must &rsquo;a&rsquo; got the
    jams early in his spree, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be a-making for me with near
    a bottleful left. Howsomenever, here goes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Looking round, his eyes lit up with satisfaction as he saw some bits of
    bark which had been left by a party of strippers who had been getting bark
    there for the stations. He picked up two pieces, one about four and the other
    six feet long, and each about two feet wide, and brought them over to the
    body. He laid the longest strip by the side of the corpse, which he proceeded
    to lift on to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Brummy,&rdquo; he said, in a softer tone than usual, &ldquo;ye
    ain&rsquo;t as bad as yer might be, considerin&rsquo; as it must be three
    good months since yer slipped yer wind. I spect it was the rum as preserved
    yer. It was the death of yer when yer was alive, an&rsquo; now yer dead,
    it preserves yer like&mdash;like a mummy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he placed the other strip on top, with the hollow side downwards&mdash;thus
    sandwiching the defunct between the two pieces&mdash;removed the saddle-strap,
    which he wore for a belt, and buckled it round one end, while he tried to
    think of something with which to tie up the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take any more strips off my shirt,&rdquo; he said,
    critically examining the skirts of the old blue overshirt he wore. &ldquo;I
    might get a strip or two more off, but it&rsquo;s short enough already. Let&rsquo;s
    see; how long have I been a-wearin&rsquo; of that shirt; oh, I remember,
    I bought it jist two days afore Five Bob was pupped. I can&rsquo;t afford
    a new shirt jist yet; howsomenever, seein&rsquo; it&rsquo;s Brummy, I&rsquo;ll
    jist borrow a couple more strips and sew &rsquo;em on agen when I git home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He up-ended Brummy, and placing his shoulder against the middle of the lower
    sheet of bark, lifted the corpse to a horizontal position; then, taking the
    bag of bones in his hand, he started for home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-spendin&rsquo; sech a dull Christmas arter all,&rdquo; he
    reflected, as he plodded on; but he had not walked above a hundred yards
    when he saw a black goanna sidling into the grass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another of them theer dang things!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    two I&rsquo;ve seed this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently he remarked: &ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t smell none too sweet, Brummy.
    It must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been jist about the middle of shearin&rsquo; when
    yer pegged out. I wonder who got yer last cheque. Shoo! theer&rsquo;s another
    black goanner&mdash;theer must be a flock of  &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rested Brummy on the ground while he had another pull at the bottle,
    and, before going on, packed the bag of bones on his shoulder under the body,
    and he soon stopped again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The thunderin&rsquo; jumpt-up bones is all skew-whift,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ole on, Brummy, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em&rdquo;&mdash;and
    he leaned the dead man against a tree while he settled the bones on his shoulder,
    and took another pull at the bottle.</p>
  <p>About a mile further on he heard a rustling in the grass to the right, and,
    looking round, saw another goanna gliding off sideways, with its long snaky
    neck turned towards him.</p>
  <p>This puzzled the shepherd considerably, the strangest part of it being that
    Five Bob wouldn&rsquo;t touch the reptile, but slunk off with his tail down
    when ordered to &ldquo;sick &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s sothin&rsquo; comic about them theer goanners,&rdquo; said
    the old man at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seed swarms of grasshoppers an&rsquo; big
    mobs of kangaroos, but dang me if ever I seed a flock of black goanners afore!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On reaching the hut the old man dumped the corpse against the wall, wrong
    end up, and stood scratching his head while he endeavoured to collect his
    muddled thoughts; but he had not placed Brummy at the correct angle, and,
    consequently, that individual fell forward and struck him a violent blow
    on the shoulder with the iron toes of his blucher boots.</p>
  <p>The shock sobered him. He sprang a good yard, instinctively hitching up
    his moleskins in preparation for flight; but a backward glance revealed to
    him the true cause of this supposed attack from the rear. Then he lifted
    the body, stood it on its feet against the chimney, and ruminated as to where
    he should lodge his mate for the night, not noticing that the shorter sheet
    of bark had slipped down on the boots and left the face exposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spect I&rsquo;ll have ter put yer into the chimney-trough for the
    night, Brummy,&rdquo; said he, turning round to confront the corpse. &ldquo;Yer
    can&rsquo;t expect me to take yer into the hut, though I did it when yer
    was in a worse state than&mdash;Lord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The shepherd was not prepared for the awful scrutiny that gleamed on him
    from those empty sockets; his nerves received a shock, and it was some time
    before he recovered himself sufficiently to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look a-here, Brummy,&rdquo; said he, shaking his finger severely
    at the delinquent, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pick a row with yer; I&rsquo;d
    do as much for yer an&rsquo;  more than any other man, an&rsquo; well yer
    knows it; but if yer starts playin&rsquo; any of yer jumpt-up pranktical
    jokes on me, and a-scarin&rsquo; of me after a-humpin&rsquo; of yer  &rsquo;ome,
    by the &rsquo;oly frost I&rsquo;ll kick yer to jim-rags, so I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This admonition delivered, he hoisted Brummy into the chimney-trough, and
    with a last glance towards the sheep-yards, he retired to his bunk to have,
    as he said, a snooze.</p>
  <p>He had more than a snooze, however, for when he woke, it was dark, and the
    bushman&rsquo;s instinct told him it must be nearly nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>He lit a slush-lamp and poured the remainder of the rum into a pannikin;
    but, just as he was about to lift the draught to his lips, he heard a peculiar
    rustling sound overhead, and put the pot down on the table with a slam that
    spilled some of the precious liquor.</p>
  <p>Five Bob whimpered, and the old shepherd, though used to the weird and dismal,
    as one living alone in the bush must necessarily be, felt the icy breath
    of fear at his heart.</p>
  <p>He reached hastily for his old shot-gun, and went out to investigate. He
    walked round the but several times and examined the roof on all sides, but
    saw nothing. Brummy appeared to be in the same position.</p>
  <p>At last, persuading himself that the noise was caused by possums or the
    wind, the old man went inside, boiled his billy, and, after composing his
    nerves somewhat with a light supper and a meditative smoke, retired for the
    night. He was aroused several times before midnight by the same mysterious
    sound overhead, but, though he rose and examined the roof on each occasion
    by the light of the rising moon, he discovered nothing.</p>
  <p>At last he determined to sit up and watch until daybreak, and for this purpose
    took up a position on a log a short distance from the hut, with his gun laid
    in readiness across his knee.</p>
  <p>After watching for about an hour, he saw a black object coming over the
    ridge-pole. He grabbed his gun and fired. The thing disappeared. He ran round
    to the other side of the hut, and there was a great black goanna in violent
    convulsions on the ground.</p>
  <p>Then the old man saw it all. &ldquo;The thunderin&rsquo; jumpt-up thing
    has been a-havin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The same
    cuss-o&rsquo;-God wretch has a-follered me &rsquo;ome, an&rsquo; has been
    a-havin&rsquo; its Christmas dinner off of Brummy, an&rsquo; a-hauntin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me
    into the bargain, the jumpt-up tinker!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As there was no one by whom he could send a message to the station, and
    the old man dared not leave the sheep and go himself, he determined to bury
    the body the next afternoon, reflecting that the authorities could disinter
    it for inquest if they pleased.</p>
  <p>So he brought the sheep home early and made arrangements for the burial
    by measuring the outer casing of Brummy and digging a hole according to those
    dimensions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;minds me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never rightly knowed
    Brummy&rsquo;s religion, blest if ever I did. Howsomenever, there&rsquo;s
    one thing sartin&mdash;none o&rsquo; them theer pianer-fingered parsons is
    a-goin&rsquo; ter take the trouble ter travel out inter this God-forgotten
    part to hold sarvice over him, seein&rsquo; as how his last cheque&rsquo;s
    blued. But, as I&rsquo;ve got the fun&rsquo;ral arrangements all in me own
    hands, I&rsquo;ll do jestice to it, and see that Brummy has a good comfortable
    buryin&rsquo;&mdash;and more&rsquo;s unpossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time yer turned in, Brum,&rdquo; he said, lifting the
    body down.</p>
  <p>He carried it to the grave and dropped it into one corner like a post. He
    arranged the bark so as to cover the face, and, by means of a piece of clothes-line,
    lowered the body to a horizontal position. Then he threw in an armful of
    gum-leaves, and then, very reluctantly, took the shovel and dropped in a
    few shovelfuls of earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; this is the last of Brummy,&rdquo; he said, leaning on
    his spade and looking away over the tops of the ragged gums on the distant
    range.</p>
  <p>This reflection seemed to engender a flood of memories, in which the old
    man became absorbed. He leaned heavily upon his spade and thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arter all,&rdquo; he murmured sadly, &ldquo;arter all&mdash;it were
    Brummy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brummy,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now; nothin&rsquo; matters
    now&mdash;nothin&rsquo;  didn&rsquo;t ever matter, nor&mdash;nor don&rsquo;t.
    You uster say as how it &rsquo;ud be all right termorrer&rdquo;  (pause); &ldquo;termorrer&rsquo;s
    come, Brummy&mdash;come fur you&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t come fur me yet, but&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He threw in some more earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t remember, Brummy, an&rsquo; mebbe yer don&rsquo;t
    want to remember&mdash;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to remember&mdash;but&mdash;well,
    but, yer see that&rsquo;s where yer got the pull on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shovelled in some more earth and paused again.</p>
  <p>The dog rose, with ears erect, and looked anxiously first at his master
    and then into the grave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Theer oughter be somethin&rsquo; sed,&rdquo; muttered the old man; &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
    right to put &rsquo;im under like a dog. Theer oughter be some sort o&rsquo; sarmin.&rdquo; He
    sighed heavily in the listening silence that followed this remark and proceeded
    with his work. He filled the grave to the brim this time, and fashioned the
    mound carefully with his spade. Once or twice he muttered the words, &ldquo;I
    am the rassaraction.&rdquo; As he laid the tools quietly aside, and stood
    at the head of the grave, he was evidently trying to remember the something
    that ought to be said. He removed his hat, placed it carefully on the grass,
    held his hands out from his sides and a little to the front, drew a long
    deep breath, and said with a solemnity that greatly disturbed Five Bob: &ldquo;Hashes
    ter hashes, dus ter dus, Brummy&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; in hopes
    of a great an&rsquo; gerlorious rassaraction!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat down on a log near by, rested his elbows on his knees and passed
    his hand wearily over his forehead&mdash;but only as one who was tired and
    felt the heat; and presently he rose, took up the tools, and walked back
    to the hut.</p>
  <p>And the sun sank again on the grand Australian bush&mdash;the nurse and
    tutor of eccentric minds, the home of the weird.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OurPipes"></a>Our Pipes</b></h2>
  <p>The moon rose away out on the edge of a smoky plain, seen through a sort
    of tunnel or arch in the fringe of mulga behind which we were camped&mdash;Jack
    Mitchell and I. The timber proper was just behind us, very thick and very
    dark. The moon looked like a big new copper boiler set on edge on the horizon
    of the plain, with the top turned towards us and a lot of old rags and straw
    burning inside.</p>
  <p>We had tramped twenty-five miles on a dry stretch on a hot day&mdash;swagmen
    know what that means. We reached the water about two hours &ldquo;after dark&rdquo;&mdash;swagmen
    know what that means. We didn&rsquo;t sit down at once and rest&mdash;we
    hadn&rsquo;t rested for the last ten miles. We knew that if we sat down we
    wouldn&rsquo;t want to get up again in a hurry&mdash;that, if we did, our
    leg-sinews, especially those of our calves, would &ldquo;draw&rdquo;  like
    red-hot wire&rsquo;s. You see, we hadn&rsquo;t been long on the track this
    time&mdash;it was only our third day out. Swagmen will understand.</p>
  <p>We got the billy boiled first, and some leaves laid down for our beds and
    the swags rolled out. We thanked the Lord that we had some cooked meat and
    a few johnny-cakes left, for we didn&rsquo;t feel equal to cooking. We put
    the billy of tea and our tucker-bags between the heads of our beds, and the
    pipes and tobacco in the crown of an old hat, where we could reach them without
    having to get up. Then we lay down on our stomachs and had a feed. We didn&rsquo;t
    eat much&mdash;we were too tired for that&mdash;but we drank a lot of tea.
    We gave our calves time to tone down a bit; then we lit up and began to answer
    each other. It got to be pretty comfortable, so long as we kept those unfortunate
    legs of ours straight and didn&rsquo;t move round much.</p>
  <p>We cursed society because we weren&rsquo;t rich men, and then we felt better
    and conversation drifted lazily round various subjects and ended in that
    of smoking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How I came to start smoking?&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
    see.&rdquo; He reflected.  &ldquo;I started smoking first when I was about
    fourteen or fifteen. I smoked some sort of weed&mdash;I forget the name of
    it&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t tobacco; and then I smoked cigarettes&mdash;not
    the ones we get now, for those cost a penny each. Then I reckoned that, if
    I could smoke those, I could smoke a pipe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We lived in Sydney then&mdash;Surry Hills. Those were different times;
    the place was nearly all sand. The old folks were alive then, and we were
    all at home, except Tom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!... Well, one evening I was playing marbles out in front
    of our house when a chap we knew gave me his pipe to mind while he went into
    a church-meeting. The little church was opposite&mdash;a &lsquo;chapel&rsquo; they
    called it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The pipe was alight. It was a clay pipe and niggerhead tobacco. Mother
    was at work out in the kitchen at the back, washing up the tea-things, and,
    when I went in, she said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been smoking!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t deny it&mdash;I was too sick to do so, or
    care much, anyway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give me that pipe!&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said I hadn&rsquo;t got it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Give&mdash;me&mdash;that&mdash;pipe</i>!&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said I hadn&rsquo;t got it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jim Brown&rsquo;s got it,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
    his.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give it to Jim Brown,&rsquo; she said; and
    she did; though it wasn&rsquo;t Jim&rsquo;s fault, for he only gave it to
    me to mind. I didn&rsquo;t smoke the pipe so much because I wanted to smoke
    a pipe just then, as because I had such a great admiration for Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell reflected, and took a look at the moon. It had risen clear and
    had got small and cold and pure-looking, and had floated away back out amongst
    the stars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I felt better towards morning, but it didn&rsquo;t cure me&mdash;being
    sick and nearly dead all night, I mean. I got a clay pipe and tobacco, and
    the old lady found it and put it in the stove. Then I got another pipe and
    tobacco, and she laid for it, and found it out at last; but she didn&rsquo;t
    put the tobacco in the stove this time&mdash;she&rsquo;d got experience.
    I don&rsquo;t know what she did with it. I tried to find it, but couldn&rsquo;t.
    I fancy the old man got hold of it, for I saw him with a plug that looked
    very much like mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t be done. I got a cherry pipe. I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t
    be so easy to break if she found it. I used to plant the bowl in one place
    and the stem in another because I reckoned that if she found one she mightn&rsquo;t
    find the other. It doesn&rsquo;t look much of an idea now, but it seemed
    like an inspiration then. Kids get rum ideas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one day I was having a smoke out at the back, when I heard
    her coming, and I pulled out the stem in a hurry and put the bowl behind
    the water-butt and the stem under the house. Mother was coming round for
    a dipper of water. I got out of her way quick, for I hadn&rsquo;t time to
    look innocent; but the bowl of the pipe was hot and she got a whiff of it.
    She went sniffing round, first on one side of the cask and then on the other,
    until she got on the scent and followed it up and found the bowl. Then I
    had only the stem left. She looked for that, but she couldn&rsquo;t scent
    it. But I couldn&rsquo;t get much comfort out of that. Have you got the matches?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I gave it best for a time and smoked cigars. They were the safest
    and most satisfactory under the circumstances, but they cost me two shillings
    a week, and I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, so I started a pipe again and then
    mother gave in at last. God bless her, and God forgive me, and us all&mdash;we
    deserve it. She&rsquo;s been at rest these seventeen long years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did your old man do when he found out that you were smoking?&rdquo;  I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he seemed to brighten up at first. You see, he was sort of
    pensioned off by mother and she kept him pretty well inside his income....
    Well, he seemed to sort of brighten up&mdash;liven up&mdash;when he found
    out that I was smoking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he? So did my old man, and he livened me up, too. But what did
    your old man do&mdash;what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, very slowly, &ldquo;about the first thing
    he did was to ask me for a fill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! many a solemn, thoughtful old smoke we had together on the quiet&mdash;the
    old man and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is your old man dead, Mitchell?&rdquo; I asked softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Long
    ago&mdash;these twelve years,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ComingAcross"></a>Coming Across</b><br>
    <font size="+1">A Study in the Steerage</font> </h2>
  <p>We were delayed for an hour or so inside Sydney Heads, taking passengers
    from the <i>Oroya,</i> which had just arrived from England and anchored off
    Watson&rsquo;s Bay. An Adelaide boat went alongside the ocean liner, while
    we dropped anchor at a respectable distance. This puzzled some of us until
    one of the passengers stopped an ancient mariner and inquired. The sailor
    jerked his thumb upwards, and left. The passengers stared aloft till some
    of them got the lockjaw in the back of their necks, and then another sailor
    suggested that we had yards to our masts, while the Adelaide boat had not.</p>
  <p>It seemed a pity that the new chums for New Zealand didn&rsquo;t have a
    chance to see Sydney after coming so far and getting so near. It struck them
    that way too. They saw Melbourne, which seemed another injustice to the old
    city. However, nothing matters much nowadays, and they might see Sydney in
    happier times.</p>
  <p>They looked like new chums, especially the &ldquo;furst clarsters,&rdquo; and
    there were two or three Scotsmen among them who looked like Scots, and talked
    like it too; also an Irishman. Great Britain and Ireland do not seem to be
    learning anything fresh about Australia. We had a yarn with one of these
    new arrivals, and got talking about the banks. It turned out that he was
    a radical. He spat over the side and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a something shame the way things is carried on! Now, look
    here, a banker can rob hundreds of wimmin and children an&rsquo; widders
    and orfuns, and nothin&rsquo;  is done to him; but if a poor man only embezzles
    a shilling <i>he gets transported to the colonies for life</i>.&rdquo; The
    italics are ours, but the words were his.</p>
  <p>We explained to this new chum that transportation was done away with long
    ago, as far as Australia was concerned, that no more convicts were sent out
    here&mdash;only men who ought to be; and he seemed surprised. He did not
    call us a liar, but he looked as if he thought that we were prevaricating.
    We were glad that he didn&rsquo;t say so, for he was a bigger man. New chums
    are generally more robust than Australians.</p>
  <p>When we got through the Heads someone pointed to the wrong part of the cliff
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shortly afterwards another man pointed to another wrong part of the cliffs
    and observed incidentally:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pretty soon a third man came along and pointed to a third wrong part of
    the cliff, and remarked casually:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We moved aft and met the fourth mate, who jerked his thumb over his shoulder
    at the cliffs in general, and muttered condescendingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not long before a woman turned round and asked &ldquo;Was that the
    place where the Dunbar was wrecked, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and she said &ldquo;Lor,&rdquo; and beckoned
    to a friend.</p>
  <p>We went for&rsquo;ard and met an old sailor, who glared at us, jerked his
    thumb at the coast and growled:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> went down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then we went below; but we felt a slight relief when he said &ldquo;went
    down&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It is doubtful whether a passenger boat ever cleared Sydney Heads since
    the wild night of that famous wreck without someone pointing to the wrong
    part of the cliffs, and remarking:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>Dunbar</i> fiend is inseparable from Australian coasting steamers.</p>
  <p>We travelled second-class in the interests of journalism. You get more points
    for copy in the steerage. It was a sacrifice; but we hope to profit by it
    some day.</p>
  <p>There were about fifty male passengers, including half a dozen New Zealand
    shearers, two of whom came on board drunk&mdash;their remarks for the first
    night mainly consisted of &ldquo;gory.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gory&rdquo; is part
    of the Australian language now&mdash;a big part.</p>
  <p>The others were chiefly tradesmen, labourers, clerks and bagmen, driven
    out of Australia by the hard times there, and glad, no doubt, to get away.
    There was a jeweller on board, of course, and his name was Moses or Cohen.
    If it wasn&rsquo;t it should have been&mdash;or Isaacs. His christian name
    was probably Benjamin. We called him Jacobs. He passed away most of his time
    on board in swopping watch lies with the other passengers and good-naturedly
    spoiling their Waterburys.</p>
  <p>One commercial traveller shipped with a flower in his buttonhole. His girl
    gave it to him on the wharf, and told him to keep it till it faded, and then
    press it. She was a barmaid. She thought he was &ldquo;going saloon,&rdquo; but
    he came forward as soon as the wharf was out of sight. He gave the flower
    to the stewardess, and told us about these things one moonlight night during
    the voyage.</p>
  <p>There was another&mdash;a well-known Sydney man&mdash;whose friends thought
    he was going saloon, and turned up in good force to see him off. He spent
    his last shilling &ldquo;shouting,&rdquo; and kept up his end of the pathetic
    little farce out of consideration for the feelings of certain proud female
    relatives, and not because he was &ldquo;proud&rdquo;&mdash;at least in that
    way. He stood on a conspicuous part of the saloon deck and waved his white
    handkerchief until Miller&rsquo;s Point came between. Then he came forward
    where he belonged. But he was proud&mdash;bitterly so. He had a flower too,
    but he did not give it to the stewardess. He had it pressed, we think (for
    we knew him), and perhaps he wears it now over the place where his heart
    used to be.</p>
  <p>When Australia was fading from view we shed a tear, which was all we had
    to shed; at least, we tried to shed a tear, and could not. It is best to
    be exact when you are writing from experience.</p>
  <p>Just as Australia was fading from view, someone looked through a glass,
    and said in a sad, tired kind of voice that he could just see the place where
    the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.</p>
  <p>Several passengers were leaning about and saying &ldquo;Europe! E-u-rope!&rdquo;  in
    agonized tones. None of them were going to Europe, and the new chums said
    nothing about it. This reminds us that some people say &ldquo;Asia! Asia!
    Ak-kak-Asia!&rdquo; when somebody spills the pepper. There was a pepper-box
    without a stopper on the table in our cabin. The fact soon attracted attention.</p>
  <p>A new chum came along and asked us whether the Maoris were very bad round
    Sydney. He&rsquo;d heard that they were. We told him that we had never had
    any trouble with them to speak of, and gave him another show.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of the wreck of the <i>Dunbar</i>?&rdquo; we asked.
    He said that he never &ldquo;heerd tell&rdquo; of it, but he had heerd of
    the wreck of the <i>Victoria</i>.</p>
  <p>We gave him best.</p>
  <p>The first evening passed off quietly, except for the vinously-excited shearers.
    They had sworn eternal friendship with a convivial dude from the saloon,
    and he made a fine specimen fool of himself for an hour or so. He never showed
    his nose for&rsquo;ard again.</p>
  <p>Now and then a passenger would solemnly seek the steward and have a beer.
    The steward drew it out of a small keg which lay on its side on a shelf with
    a wooden tap sticking out of the end of it&mdash;out of the end of the keg,
    we mean. The beer tasted like warm but weak vinegar, and cost sixpence per
    small glass. The bagman told the steward that he could not compliment him
    on the quality of his liquor, but the steward said nothing. He did not even
    seem interested&mdash;only bored. He had heard the same remark often before,
    no doubt. He was a fat, solemn steward&mdash;not formal, but very reticent&mdash;unresponsive.
    He looked like a man who had conducted a religious conservative paper once
    and failed, and had then gone into the wholesale produce line, and failed
    again, and finally got his present billet through the influence of his creditors
    and two clergymen. He might have been a sociable fellow, a man about town,
    even a gay young dog, and a radical writer before he was driven to accept
    the editorship of the aforesaid periodical. He probably came of a &ldquo;good
    English family.&rdquo; He was now, very likely, either a rigid Presbyterian
    or an extreme freethinker. He thought a lot, anyway, and looked as if he
    knew a lot too&mdash;too much for words, in fact.</p>
  <p>We took a turn on deck before turning in, and heard two men arguing about
    the way in which the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.</p>
  <p>The commercial travellers, the jeweller, and one or two new chums who were
    well provided with clothing undressed deliberately and retired ostentatiously
    in pyjamas, but there were others&mdash;men of better days&mdash;who turned
    in either very early or very late, when the cabin was quiet, and slipped
    hurriedly and furtively out of their clothes and between the blankets, as
    if they were ashamed of the poverty of their underwear. It is well that the
    Lord can see deep down into the hearts of men, for He has to judge them;
    it is well that the majority of mankind cannot, because, if they could, the
    world would be altogether too sorrowful to live in; and we do not think the
    angels can either, else they would not be happy&mdash;if they could and were
    they would not be angels any longer&mdash;they would be devils. Study it
    out on a slate.</p>
  <p>We turned in feeling comfortably dismal, and almost wishing that we had
    gone down with the <i>Dunbar</i>.</p>
  <p>The intoxicated shearers and the dude kept their concert up till a late
    hour that night&mdash;or, rather, a very early hour next morning; and at
    about midnight they were reinforced by the commercial traveller and Moses,
    the jeweller, who had been visiting acquaintances aft. This push was encouraged
    by voices from various bunks, and enthusiastically barracked for by a sandy-complexioned,
    red-headed comedian with twinkling grey eyes, who occupied the berth immediately
    above our own.</p>
  <p>They stood with their backs to the bunks, and their feet braced against
    the deck, or lurched round, and took friendly pulls from whisky flasks, and
    chyacked each other, and laughed, and blowed, and lied like&mdash;like Australian
    bushmen; and occasionally they broke out into snatches of song&mdash;and
    as often broke down. Few Englishmen know more than the first verse, or two
    lines, of even their most popular song, and, where elevated enough to think
    they can sing, they repeat the first verse over and over again, with the
    wrong words, and with a sort of &ldquo;Ta-ra-ra-rum-ti-tooral, ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-rum-ti,
    ta-ra-ra-rum-tum-ti-rum-rum-tum-ti-dee-e-e,&rdquo; by way of variation.</p>
  <p>Presently&mdash;suddenly, it seemed to our drowsy senses&mdash;two of the
    shearers and the bagman commenced arguing with drunken gravity and precision
    about politics, even while a third bushman was approaching the climax of
    an out-back yarn of many adjectives, of which he himself was the hero. The
    scraps of conversation that we caught were somewhat as follow. We leave out
    most of the adjectives.</p>
  <p>First Voice: &ldquo;Now, look here. The women will vote for men, not principles.
    That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m against women voting. Now, just mark my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Third Voice (trying to finish yarn): &ldquo;Hold on. Just wait till I tell
    yer. Well, this bloomin&rsquo; bloke, he says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Second Voice (evidently in reply to first): &ldquo;Principles you mean,
    not men. You&rsquo;re getting a bit mixed, old man.&rdquo; (Smothered chuckle
    from comedian over our head.)</p>
  <p>Third Voice (seeming to drift round in search of sympathy): &ldquo;&lsquo;You
    will!&rsquo;  sez I. &lsquo;Yes, I will,&rsquo; he sez. &lsquo;Oh, you will,
    will yer?&rsquo; I sez; and with that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Second Voice (apparently wandering from both subjects) &ldquo;Blanker has
    always stuck up for the workin&rsquo; man, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll get in,
    you&rsquo;ll see. Why, he&rsquo;s a bloomin&rsquo;  workin&rsquo; man himself.
    Me and Blanker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Disgusted voice from a bunk: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s damn rot! We&rsquo;ve
    had enough of lumpers in parliament! Horny hands are all right enough, but
    we don&rsquo;t want any more blanky horny heads!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Third Voice (threateningly): &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; about &rsquo;orny
    heads? That pitch is meant for us, ain&rsquo;t it? Do you mean to say that
    I&rsquo;ve got a &rsquo;orny head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here two men commenced snarling at each other, and there was some talk of
    punching the causes of the dispute; but the bagman interfered, a fresh flask
    was passed round, and some more eternal friendship sworn to.</p>
  <p>We dozed off again, and the next time we were aware of anything the commercial
    and Moses had disappeared, the rest were lying or sitting in their bunks,
    and the third shearer was telling a yarn about an alleged fight he had at
    a shed up-country; and perhaps he was telling it for the benefit of the dissatisfied
    individual who made the injudicious remark concerning horny heads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I said to the boss-over-the-board, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a nice
    sort of a thing,&rsquo;  I sez. &lsquo;Who are you talkin&rsquo; to?&rsquo; he
    says. &lsquo;You, bless yer,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo;  he
    says, &lsquo;you get your cheque and clear! &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;you
    can take that!&rsquo;  and I hauled off and landed him a beauty under the
    butt of the listener. Then the boss came along with two blacklegs, but the
    boys made a ring, and I laid out the blanks in just five minutes. Then I
    sez to the boss, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of cove I am,&rsquo; I sez, &rsquo;an&rsquo; now,
    if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But just here there came a deep, growling voice&mdash;seemingly from out
    of the depths of the forehold&mdash;anyway, there came a voice, and it said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake give her a rest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The steward turned off the electricity, but there were two lanterns dimly
    burning in our part of the steerage. It was a narrow compartment running
    across the width of the boat, and had evidently been partitioned off from
    the top floor of the hold to meet the emigration from Australia to New Zealand.
    There were three tiers of bunks, two deep, on the far side, three rows of
    single bunks on the other, and two at each end of the cabin, the top ones
    just under the portholes.</p>
  <p>The shearers had turned in &ldquo;all standing;&rdquo; two of them were
    lying feet to feet in a couple of outside lower berths. One lay on his stomach
    with his face turned outwards, his arm thrown over the side of the bunk,
    and his knuckles resting on the deck, the other rested on the broad of his
    back with his arm also hanging over the side and his knuckles resting on
    the floor. And so they slept the sleep of the drunk.</p>
  <p>A fair, girl-faced young Swiss emigrant occupied one of the top berths,
    with his curly, flaxen head resting close alongside one of the lanterns that
    were dimly burning, and an Anglo-foreign dictionary in his hand. His mate,
    or brother, who resembled him in everything except that he had dark hair,
    lay asleep alongside; and in the next berth a long consumptive-looking new
    chum sat in his pyjamas, with his legs hanging over the edge, and his hands
    grasping the sideboard, to which, on his right hand, a sort of tin-can arrangement
    was hooked. He was staring intently at nothing, and seemed to be thinking
    very hard.</p>
  <p>We dozed off again, and woke suddenly to find our eyes wide open, and the
    young Swiss still studying, and the jackaroo still sitting in the same position,
    but with a kind of waiting expression on his face&mdash;a sort of expectant
    light in his eyes. Suddenly he lurched for the can, and after awhile he lay
    back looking like a corpse.</p>
  <p>We slept again, and finally awoke to daylight and the clatter of plates.
    All the bunks were vacated except two, which contained corpses, apparently.</p>
  <p>Wet decks, and a round, stiff, morning breeze, blowing strongly across the
    deck, abeam, and gustily through the open portholes. There was a dull grey
    sky, and the sea at first sight seemed to be of a dark blue or green, but
    on closer inspection it took a dirty slate colour, with splashes as of indigo
    in the hollows. There was one of those near, yet far-away horizons.</p>
  <p>About two-thirds of the men were on deck, but the women had not shown up
    yet&mdash;nor did they show up until towards the end of the trip.</p>
  <p>Some of the men were smoking in a sheltered corner, some walking up and
    down, two or three trying to play quoits, one looking at the poultry, one
    standing abaft the purser&rsquo;s cabin with hands in the pockets of his
    long ragged overcoat, watching the engines, and two more&mdash;carpenters&mdash;were
    discussing a big cedar log, about five feet in diameter, which was lashed
    on deck alongside the hatch.</p>
  <p>While we were waiting for the <i>Oroya</i> some of the ship&rsquo;s officers
    came and had a consultation over this log and called up part of the crew,
    who got some more ropes and a chain on to it. It struck us at the time that
    that log would make a sensation if it fetched loose in rough weather. But
    there wasn&rsquo;t any rough weather.</p>
  <p>The fore-cabin was kept clean; the assistant steward was good-humoured and
    obliging; his chief was civil enough to freeze the Never-Never country; but
    the bill of fare was monotonous.</p>
  <p>During the afternoon a first-salooner made himself obnoxious by swelling
    round for&rsquo;ard. He was a big bull-necked &ldquo;Britisher&rdquo; (that
    word covers it) with a bloated face, prominent gooseberry eyes, fore &rsquo;n&rsquo; aft
    cap, and long tan shoes. He seemed as if he&rsquo;d come to see a &ldquo;zoo,&rdquo; and
    was dissatisfied with it&mdash;had a fine contempt for it, in fact, because
    it did not come up to other zoological gardens that he had seen in London,
    and on the <i>aw</i>-continong and in the-<i>aw</i>-er-<i>aw</i>&mdash;the
    States, dontcherknow. The fellows reckoned that he ought to be &ldquo;took
    down a peg&rdquo;  (dontcherknow) and the sandy-complexioned comedian said
    he&rsquo;d do it. So he stepped softly up to the swell, tapped him lightly
    on the shoulder, and pointed aft&mdash;holding his arm out like a pump handle
    and his forefinger rigid.</p>
  <p>The Britisher&rsquo;s face was a study; it was blank at first and then it
    went all colours, and wore, in succession, every possible expression except
    a pleasant one. He seemed bursting with indignation, but he did not speak&mdash;could
    not, perhaps; and, as soon as he could detach his feet from the spot to which
    they had been nailed in the first place by astonishment, he stalked aft.
    He did not come to see the zoo any more.</p>
  <p>The fellows in the fore-cabin that evening were growling about the bad quality
    of the grub supplied.</p>
  <p>Then the shearer&rsquo;s volcano showed signs of activity. He shifted round,
    spat impatiently, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You chaps don&rsquo;t know what yer talkin&rsquo; about. You want
    something to grumble about. You should have been out with me last year on
    the Paroo in Noo South Wales. The meat we got there was so bad that it uster
    travel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! travel! take the track! go on the wallaby! The cockies over
    there used to hang the meat up on the branches of the trees, and just shake
    it whenever they wanted to feed the fowls. And the water was so bad that
    half a pound of tea in the billy wouldn&rsquo;t make no impression on the
    colour&mdash;nor the taste. The further west we went the worse our meat got,
    till at last we had to carry a dog-chain to chain it up at night. Then it
    got worse and broke the chain, and then we had to train the blessed dogs
    to shepherd it and bring it back. But we fell in with another chap with a
    bad old dog&mdash;a downright knowing, thieving, old hard-case of a dog;
    and this dog led our dogs astray&mdash;demoralized them&mdash;corrupted
    their morals&mdash;and so one morning they came home with the blooming meat
    inside them, instead of outside&mdash;and we had to go hungry for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better turn in, gentlemen. I&rsquo;m going to turn off
    the light,&rdquo;  said the steward.</p>
  <p>The yarn reminded the Sydney man of a dog he had, and he started some dog
    lies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This dog of mine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;knowed the way into the
    best public-houses. If I came to a strange town and wanted a good drink,
    I&rsquo;d only have to say, &lsquo;Jack, I&rsquo;m dry,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;d
    lead me all right. He always knew the side entrances and private doors after
    hours, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the yarn did not go very well&mdash;it fell flat in fact. Then the commercial
    traveller was taken bad with an anecdote. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;I had a black bag once that knew the way into public-houses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. A black bag. A long black bag like that one I&rsquo;ve got there
    in my bunk. I was staying at a boarding-house in Sydney, and one of us used
    to go out every night for a couple of bottles of beer, and we carried the
    bottles in the bag; and when we got opposite the pub the front end of the
    bag would begin to swing round towards the door. It was wonderful. It was
    just as if there was a lump of steel in the end of the bag and a magnet in
    the bar. We tried it with ever so many people, but it always acted the same.
    We couldn&rsquo;t use that bag for any other purpose, for if we carried it
    along the street it would make our wrists ache trying to go into pubs. It
    twisted my wrist one time, and it ain&rsquo;t got right since&mdash;I always
    feel the pain in dull weather. Well, one night we got yarning and didn&rsquo;t
    notice how the time was going, and forgot to go for the beer till it was
    nearly too late. We looked for the bag and couldn&rsquo;t find it&mdash;we
    generally kept it under a side-table, but it wasn&rsquo;t there, and before
    we were done looking, eleven o&rsquo;clock went. We sat down round the fire,
    feeling pretty thirsty, and were just thinking about turning in when we heard
    a thump on the table behind us. We looked round, and there was that bag with
    two full bottles of English ale in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I remembered that I&rsquo;d left a bob in the bottom of the
    bag, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The steward turned off the electric light.</p>
  <p>There were some hundreds of cases of oranges stacked on deck, and made fast
    with matting and cordage to the bulwarks. That night was very dark, and next
    morning there was a row. The captain said he&rsquo;d &ldquo;give any man
    three months that he caught at those oranges.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot, yer givin&rsquo; us?&rdquo; said a shearer. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
    know anything about yer bloomin&rsquo; oranges.... I seen one of the saloon
    passengers moochin&rsquo; round for&rsquo;ard last night. You&rsquo;d better
    search the saloon for your blarsted oranges, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t come round
    tacklin&rsquo; the wrong men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not necessary to search our quarters, for the &ldquo;offside&rdquo; steward
    was sweeping orange peel out of the steerage for three days thereafter.</p>
  <p>And that night, just as we were about to fall asleep, a round, good-humoured
    face loomed over the edge of the shelf above and a small, twinkling, grey
    eye winked at us. Then a hand came over, gave a jerk, and something fell
    on our nose. It was an orange. We sent a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; up through
    the boards and commenced hurriedly and furtively to stow away the orange.
    But the comedian had an axe to grind&mdash;most people have&mdash;wanted
    to drop his peel alongside our berth; and it made us uneasy because we did
    not want circumstantial evidence lying round us if the captain chanced to
    come down to inquire. The next man to us had a barney with the man above
    him about the same thing. Then the peel was scattered round pretty fairly,
    or thrown into an empty bunk, and no man dared growl lest he should come
    to be regarded as a blackleg&mdash;a would-be informer.</p>
  <p>The men opposite the door kept a look out; and two Australian jokers sat
    in the top end berth with their legs hanging over and swinging contentedly,
    and the porthole open ready for a swift and easy disposal of circumstantial
    evidence on the first alarm. They were eating a pineapple which they had
    sliced and extracted in sections from a crate up on deck. They looked so
    chummy, and so school-boyishly happy and contented, that they reminded us
    of the days long ago, when we were so high.</p>
  <p>The chaps had talk about those oranges on deck next day. The commercial
    traveller said we had a right to the oranges, because the company didn&rsquo;t
    give us enough to eat. He said that we were already suffering from insufficient
    proper nourishment, and he&rsquo;d tell the doctor so if the doctor came
    on board at Auckland. Anyway, it was no sin to rob a company.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said our comedian, &ldquo;those oranges, perhaps,
    were sent over by a poor, struggling orange grower, with a wife and family
    to keep, and he&rsquo;ll have to bear the loss, and a few bob might make
    a lot of difference to him. It ain&rsquo;t right to rob a poor man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This made us feel doubtful and mean, and one or two got uncomfortable and
    shifted round uneasily. But presently the traveller came to the rescue. He
    said that no doubt the oranges belonged to a middleman, and the middleman
    was the curse of the country. We felt better.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the trip the women began to turn up. There were five
    grass widows, and every female of them had a baby. The Australian marries
    young and poor; and, when he can live no longer in his native land, he sells
    the furniture, buys a steerage ticket to New Zealand or Western Australia,
    and leaves his wife with her relatives or friends until he earns enough money
    to send for her. Four of our women were girl-wives, and mostly pretty. One
    little handful of a thing had a fine baby boy, nearly as big as herself,
    and she looked so fragile and pale, and pretty and lonely, and had such an
    appealing light in her big shadowed brown eyes, and such a pathetic droop
    at the corners of her sweet little mouth, that you longed to take her in
    your manly arms&mdash;baby and all&mdash;and comfort her.</p>
  <p>The last afternoon on high seas was spent in looking through glasses for
    the Pinnacles, off North Cape. And, as we neared the land, the commercial
    traveller remarked that he wouldn&rsquo;t mind if there was a wreck now&mdash;provided
    we all got saved.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have all our names in the papers,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;Gallant conduct of the passengers and crew. Heroic rescue by
    Mr So-and-so-climbing the cliffs with a girl under his arm, and all that
    sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps smiled a doleful smile, and turned away again to look at the Promised
    Land. They had had no anxiety to speak of for the last two or three days;
    but now they were again face to face with the cursed question, &ldquo;How
    to make a living.&rdquo; They were wondering whether or no they would get
    work in New Zealand, and feeling more doubtful about it than when they embarked.</p>
  <p>Pity we couldn&rsquo;t go to sea and sail away for ever, and never see land
    any more&mdash;or, at least, not till better and brighter days&mdash;if they
    ever come.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStoryOfMalachi"></a>The Story Of Malachi</b></h2>
  <p>Malachi was very tall, very thin, and very round-shouldered, and the sandiness
    of his hair also cried aloud for an adjective. All the boys considered Malachi
    the greatest ass on the station, and there was no doubt that he <i>was</i> an
    awful fool. He had never been out of his native bush in all his life, excepting
    once, when he paid a short visit to Sydney, and when he returned it was evident
    that his nerves had received a shaking. We failed to draw one word out of
    Malachi regarding his views on the city&mdash;to describe it was not in his
    power, for it had evidently been something far beyond his comprehension.
    Even after his visit had become a matter of history, if you were to ask him
    what he thought of Sydney the dazed expression would come back into his face,
    and he would scratch his head and say in a slow and deliberate manner, &ldquo;Well,
    there&rsquo;s no mistake, it&rsquo;s a caution.&rdquo;  And as such the city
    remained, so far as Malachi&rsquo;s opinion of it was concerned.</p>
  <p>Malachi was always shabbily dressed, in spite of his pound a week and board,
    and &ldquo;When Malachi gets a new suit of clothes&rdquo; was the expression
    invariably used by the boys to fix a date for some altogether improbable
    event. We were always having larks with Malachi, for we looked upon him as
    our legitimate butt. He seldom complained, and when he did his remonstrance
    hardly ever went beyond repeating the words, &ldquo;Now, none of your pranktical
    jokes!&rdquo; If this had not the desired effect, and we put up some too
    outrageous trick on him, he would content himself by muttering with sorrowful
    conviction, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no mistake, it&rsquo;s a caution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We were not content with common jokes, such as sewing up the legs of Malachi&rsquo;s
    trousers while he slept, fixing his bunk, or putting explosives in his pipe&mdash;we
    aspired to some of the higher branches of the practical joker&rsquo;s art.
    It was well known that Malachi had an undying hatred for words of four syllables
    and over, and the use of them was always sufficient to forfeit any good opinions
    he might have previously entertained concerning the user. &ldquo;I hate them
    high-flown words,&rdquo;  he would say&mdash;&ldquo;I got a book at home
    that I could get them out of if I wanted them; but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The
    book referred to was a very dilapidated dictionary. Malachi&rsquo;s hatred
    for high-flown words was only equalled by his aversion to the opposite sex;
    and, this being known, we used to write letters to him in a feminine hand,
    threatening divers breach of promise actions, and composed in the high-flown
    language above alluded to. We used to think this very funny, and by these
    means we made his life a burden to him. Malachi put the most implicit faith
    in everything we told him; he would take in the most improbable yarn provided
    we preserved a grave demeanour and used no high-flown expressions. He would
    indeed sometimes remark that our yarns were a caution, but that was all.</p>
  <p>We played upon him the most gigantic joke of all during the visit of a certain
    bricklayer, who came to do some work at the homestead. &ldquo;Bricky&rdquo; was
    a bit of a phrenologist, and knew enough of physiognomy and human nature
    to give a pretty fair delineation of character. He also went in for spirit-rapping,
    greatly to the disgust of the two ancient housekeepers, who declared that
    they&rsquo;d have &ldquo;no dalins wid him and his divil&rsquo;s worruk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bricklayer was from the first an object of awe to Malachi, who carefully
    avoided him; but one night we got the butt into a room where the artisan
    was entertaining the boys with a seance. After the table-rapping, during
    which Malachi sat with uncovered head and awe-struck expression, we proposed
    that he should have his bumps read, and before he could make his escape Malachi
    was seated in a chair in the middle of the room and the bricklayer was running
    his fingers over his head. I really believe that Malachi&rsquo;s hair bristled
    between the phrenologist&rsquo;s fingers. Whenever he made a hit his staunch
    admirer, &ldquo;Donegal,&rdquo; would exclaim &ldquo;Look at that now!&rdquo; while
    the girls tittered and said, &ldquo;Just fancy!&rdquo; and from time to time
    Malachi would be heard to mutter to himself, in a tone of the most intense
    conviction, that,  &ldquo;without the least mistake it was a caution.&rdquo; Several
    times at his work the next day Malachi was observed to rest on his spade,
    while he tilted his hat forward with one hand and felt the back of his head
    as though he had not been previously aware of its existence.</p>
  <p>We &ldquo;ran&rdquo; Malachi to believe that the bricklayer was mad on the
    subject of phrenology, and was suspected of having killed several persons
    in order to obtain their skulls for experimental purposes. We further said
    that he had been heard to say that Malachi&rsquo;s skull was a most extraordinary
    one, and so we advised him to be careful.</p>
  <p>Malachi occupied a hut some distance from the station, and one night, the
    last night of the bricklayer&rsquo;s stay, as Malachi sat smoking over the
    fire the door opened quietly and the phrenologist entered. He carried a bag
    with a pumpkin in the bottom of it, and, sitting down on a stool, he let
    the bag down with a bump on the floor between his feet. Malachi was badly
    scared, but he managed to stammer out&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello!&rdquo; said the phrenologist.</p>
  <p>There was an embarrassing silence, which was at last broken by &ldquo;Bricky&rdquo;  saying &ldquo;How
    are you gettin&rsquo; on, Malachi?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, jist right,&rdquo; replied Malachi.</p>
  <p>Nothing was said for a while, until Malachi, after fidgeting a good deal
    on his stool, asked the bricklayer when he was leaving the station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going away in the morning, early,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    jist been over to Jimmy Nowlett&rsquo;s camp, and as I was passing I thought
    I&rsquo;d call and get your head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I come for your skull.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the phrenologist continued, while Malachi sat horror-stricken;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got Jimmy Nowlett&rsquo;s skull here,&rdquo; and he lifted the bag and lovingly
    felt the pumpkin&mdash;it must have weighed forty pounds. &ldquo;I spoilt
    one of his best bumps with the tomahawk. I had to hit him twice, but it&rsquo;s
    no use crying over spilt milk.&rdquo; Here he drew a heavy shingling-hammer
    out of the bag and wiped off with his sleeve something that looked like blood.
    Malachi had been edging round for the door, and now he made a rush for it.
    But the skull-fancier was there before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gor-sake you don&rsquo;t want to murder me!&rdquo; gasped Malachi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if I can get your skull any other way,&rdquo; said Bricky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Malachi&mdash;and then, with a vague idea that
    it was best to humour a lunatic, he continued, in a tone meant to be off-hand
    and careless&mdash;&ldquo;Now, look here, if yer only waits till I die you
    can have my whole skelington and welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now Malachi,&rdquo; said the phrenologist sternly, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye
    think I&rsquo;m a fool? I ain&rsquo;t going to stand any humbug. If yer acts
    sensible you&rsquo;ll be quiet, and it&rsquo;ll soon be over, but if yer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malachi did not wait to hear the rest. He made a spring for the back of
    the hut and through it, taking down a large new sheet of stringy-bark in
    his flight. Then he could be heard loudly ejaculating &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
    caution!&rdquo; as he went through the bush like a startled kangaroo, and
    he didn&rsquo;t stop till he reached the station.</p>
  <p>Jimmy Nowlett and I had been peeping through a crack in the same sheet of
    bark that Malachi dislodged; it fell on us and bruised us somewhat, but it
    wasn&rsquo;t enough to knock the fun out of the thing.</p>
  <p>When Jimmy Nowlett crawled out from under the bark he had to lie down on
    Malachi&rsquo;s bunk to laugh, and even for some time afterwards it was not
    unusual for Jimmy to wake up in the night and laugh till we wished
    him dead.</p>
  <p>I should like to finish here, but there remains something more to be said
    about Malachi.</p>
  <p>One of the best cows at the homestead had a calf, about which she made a
    great deal of fuss. She was ordinarily a quiet, docile creature, and, though
    somewhat fussy after calving no one ever dreamed that she would injure anyone.
    It happened one day that the squatter&rsquo;s daughter and her intended husband,
    a Sydney exquisite, were strolling in a paddock where the cow was. Whether
    the cow objected to the masher or his lady love&rsquo;s red parasol, or whether
    she suspected designs upon her progeny, is not certain; anyhow, she went
    for them. The young man saw the cow coming first, and he gallantly struck
    a bee-line for the fence, leaving the girl to manage for herself. She wouldn&rsquo;t
    have managed very well if Malachi hadn&rsquo;t been passing just then. He
    saw the girl&rsquo;s danger and ran to intercept the cow with no weapon but
    his hands.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t last long. There was a roar, a rush, and a cloud of dust,
    out of which the cow presently emerged, and went scampering back to the bush
    in which her calf was hidden.</p>
  <p>We carried Malachi home and laid him on a bed. He had a terrible wound in
    the groin, and the blood soaked through the bandages like water. We did all
    that was possible for him, the boys killed the squatter&rsquo;s best horse
    and spoilt two others riding for a doctor, but it was of no use. In the last
    half-hour of his life we all gathered round Malachi&rsquo;s bed; he was only
    twenty-two. Once he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder how mother&rsquo;ll manage now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo; someone asked gently; we had
    never dreamt that Malachi might have someone to love him and be proud of
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Bathurst,&rdquo; he answered wearily&mdash;&ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
    take on awful, I &rsquo;spect, she was awful fond of me&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
    been pulling together this last ten years&mdash;mother and me&mdash;we wanted
    to make it all right for my little brother Jim&mdash;poor Jim!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Jim?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s blind,&rdquo; said Malachi &ldquo;always was&mdash;we
    wanted to make it all right for him agin time he grows up&mdash;I&mdash;I
    managed to send home about&mdash;about forty pounds a year&mdash;we bought
    a bit of ground, and&mdash;and&mdash;I think&mdash;I&rsquo;m going now. Tell &rsquo;em,
    Harry&mdash;tell  &rsquo;em how it was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had to go outside then. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it any more. There was
    a lump in my throat and I&rsquo;d have given anything to wipe out my share
    in the practical jokes, but it was too late now.</p>
  <p>Malachi was dead when I went in again, and that night the hat went round
    with the squatter&rsquo;s cheque in the bottom of it and we made it &ldquo;all
    right&rdquo;  for Malachi&rsquo;s blind brother Jim.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoDogsAndAFence"></a>Two Dogs And A Fence</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing makes a dog madder,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;than to
    have another dog come outside his fence and sniff and bark at him through
    the cracks when he can&rsquo;t get out. The other dog might be an entire
    stranger; he might be an old chum, and he mightn&rsquo;t bark&mdash;only
    sniff&mdash;but it makes no difference to the inside dog. The inside dog
    generally starts it, and the outside dog only loses his temper and gets wild
    because the inside dog has lost his and got mad and made such a stinking
    fuss about nothing at all; and then the outside dog barks back and makes
    matters a thousand times worse, and the inside dog foams at the mouth and
    dashes the foam about, and goes at it like a million steel traps.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00108-images/page270.jpg" width="504" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell why the inside dog gets so wild about it in the
    first place, except, perhaps, because he thinks the outside dog has taken
    him at a disadvantage and is &lsquo;poking it at him;&rsquo; anyway, he gets
    madder the longer it lasts, and at last he gets savage enough to snap off
    his own tail and tear it to bits, because he can&rsquo;t get out and chew
    up that other dog; and, if he did get out, he&rsquo;d kill the other dog,
    or try to, even if it was his own brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes the outside dog only smiles and trots off; sometimes he
    barks back good-humouredly; sometimes he only just gives a couple of disinterested
    barks as if he isn&rsquo;t particular, but is expected, because of his dignity
    and doghood, to say something under the circumstances; and sometimes, if
    the outside dog is a little dog, he&rsquo;ll get away from that fence in
    a hurry on the first surprise, or, if he&rsquo;s a cheeky little dog, he&rsquo;ll
    first make sure that the inside dog can&rsquo;t get out, and then he&rsquo;ll
    have some fun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amusing to see a big dog, of the Newfoundland kind, sniffing
    along outside a fence with a broad, good-natured grin on his face all the
    time the inside dog is whooping away at the rate of thirty whoops a second,
    and choking himself, and covering himself with foam, and dashing the spray
    through the cracks, and jolting and jerking every joint in his body up to
    the last joint in his tail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes the inside dog is a little dog, and the smaller he is the
    more row he makes&mdash;but then he knows he&rsquo;s safe. And, sometimes,
    as I said before, the outside dog is a short-tempered dog who hates a row,
    and never wants to have a disagreement with anybody&mdash;like a good many
    peaceful men, who hate rows, and are always nice and civil and pleasant,
    in a nasty, unpleasant, surly, sneering sort of civil way that makes you
    want to knock their heads off; men who never start a row, but keep it going,
    and make it a thousand times worse when it&rsquo;s once started, just because
    they didn&rsquo;t start it&mdash;and keep on saying so, and that the other
    party did. The short-tempered outside dog gets wild at the other dog for
    losing his temper, and says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you making such a fuss about? What&rsquo;s the matter
    with you, anyway? Hey?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the inside dog says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who do you think you&rsquo;re talking to? You&mdash;! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; etc.,
    etc., etc.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the outside dog says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re worse than a flaming old slut!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then they go at it, and you can hear them miles off, like a Chinese
    war&mdash;like a hundred great guns firing eighty blank cartridges a minute,
    till the outside dog is just as wild to get inside and eat the inside dog
    as the inside dog is to get out and disembowel him. Yet if those same two
    dogs were to meet casually outside they might get chummy at once, and be
    the best of friends, and swear everlasting mateship, and take each other
    home.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="JonessAlley"></a>Jones&rsquo;s Alley</b></h2>
  <p>She lived in Jones&rsquo;s Alley. She cleaned offices, washed, and nursed
    from daylight until any time after dark, and filled in her spare time cleaning
    her own place (which she always found dirty&mdash;in a &ldquo;beastly filthy
    state,&rdquo; she called it&mdash;on account of the children being left in
    possession all day), cooking, and nursing her own sick&mdash;for her family,
    though small, was so in the two senses of the word, and sickly; one or another
    of the children was always sick, but not through her fault. She did her own,
    or rather the family washing, at home too, when she couldn&rsquo;t do it
    by kind permission, or surreptitiously in connection with that of her employers.
    She was a haggard woman. Her second husband was supposed to be dead, and
    she, lived in dread of his daily resurrection. Her eldest son was at large,
    but, not being yet sufficiently hardened in misery, she dreaded his getting
    into trouble even more than his frequent and interested appearances at home.
    She could buy off the son for a shilling or two and a clean shirt and collar,
    but she couldn&rsquo;t purchase the absence of the father at any price&mdash;<i>he</i> claimed
    what he called his &ldquo;conzugal rights&rdquo; as well as his board, lodging,
    washing and beer. She slaved for her children, and nag-nag-nagged them everlastingly,
    whether they were in the right or in the wrong, but they were hardened to
    it and took small notice. She had the spirit of a bullock. Her whole nature
    was soured. She had those &ldquo;worse troubles&rdquo; which she couldn&rsquo;t
    tell to anybody, but had to suffer in silence.</p>
  <p>She also, in what she called her &ldquo;spare time,&rdquo; put new cuffs
    and collar-bands on gentlemen&rsquo;s shirts. The gentlemen didn&rsquo;t
    live in Jones&rsquo;s Alley&mdash;they boarded with a patroness of the haggard
    woman; they didn&rsquo;t know their shirts were done there&mdash;had they
    known it, and known Jones&rsquo;s Alley, one or two of them, who were medical
    students, might probably have objected. The landlady charged them just twice
    as much for repairing their shirts as she paid the haggard woman, who, therefore,
    being unable to buy the cuffs and collar-bands ready-made for sewing on,
    had no lack of employment with which to fill in her spare time.</p>
  <p>Therefore, she was a &ldquo;respectable woman,&rdquo; and was known in Jones&rsquo;s
    Alley as &ldquo;Misses&rdquo; Aspinall, and called so generally, and even
    by Mother Brock, who kept &ldquo;that place&rdquo; opposite. There is implied
    a world of difference between the &ldquo;Mother&rdquo;  and the &ldquo;Misses,&rdquo; as
    applied to matrons in Jones&rsquo;s Alley; and this distinction was about
    the only thing&mdash;always excepting the everlasting &ldquo;children&rdquo;&mdash;that
    the haggard woman had left to care about, to take a selfish, narrow-minded
    sort of pleasure in&mdash;if, indeed, she could yet take pleasure, grim or
    otherwise, in anything except, perhaps, a good cup of tea and time to drink
    it in.</p>
  <p>Times were hard with Mrs Aspinall. Two coppers and two half-pence in her
    purse were threepence to her now, and the absence of one of the half-pence
    made a difference to her, especially in Paddy&rsquo;s market&mdash;that eloquent
    advertisement of a young city&rsquo;s sin and poverty and rotten wealth&mdash;on
    Saturday night. She counted the coppers as anxiously and nervously as a thirsty
    dead-beat does. And her house was &ldquo;falling down on her&rdquo; and her
    troubles, and she couldn&rsquo;t get the landlord to do a &ldquo;han&rsquo;stern&rdquo; to
    it.</p>
  <p>At last, after persistent agitation on her part (but not before a portion
    of the plastered ceiling had fallen and severely injured one of her children)
    the landlord caused two men to be sent to &ldquo;effect necessary repairs&rdquo; to
    the three square, dingy, plastered holes&mdash;called &ldquo;three rooms
    and a kitchen&rdquo;&mdash;for the privilege of living in which, and calling
    it &ldquo;my place,&rdquo; she paid ten shillings a week.</p>
  <p>Previously the agent, as soon as he had received the rent and signed the
    receipt, would cut short her reiterated complaints&mdash;which he privately
    called her &ldquo;clack&rdquo;&mdash;by saying that he&rsquo;d see to it,
    he&rsquo;d speak to the landlord; and, later on, that he <i>had</i> spoken
    to him, or could do nothing more in the matter&mdash;that it wasn&rsquo;t
    his business. Neither it was, to do the agent justice. It was his business
    to collect the rent, and thereby earn the means of paying his own. He had
    to keep a family on his own account, by assisting the Fat Man to keep his
    at the expense of people&mdash;especially widows with large families, or
    women, in the case of Jones&rsquo;s Alley&mdash;who couldn&rsquo;t afford
    it without being half-starved, or running greater and unspeakable risks which &ldquo;society&rdquo; is
    not supposed to know anything about.</p>
  <p>So the agent was right, according to his lights. The landlord had recently
    turned out a family who had occupied one of his houses for fifteen years,
    because they were six weeks in arrears. He let them take their furniture,
    and explained:  &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been so lenient with them only
    they were such old tenants of mine.&rdquo;  So the landlord was always in
    the right according to <i>his</i> lights.</p>
  <p>But the agent naturally wished to earn his living as peacefully and as comfortably
    as possible, so, when the accident occurred, he put the matter so persistently
    and strongly before the landlord that he said at last: &ldquo;Well, tell
    her to go to White, the contractor, and he&rsquo;ll send a man to do what&rsquo;s
    to be done; and don&rsquo;t bother me any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>White had a look at the place, and sent a plasterer, a carpenter, and a
    plumber. The plasterer knocked a bigger hole in the ceiling and filled it
    with mud; the carpenter nailed a board over the hole in the floor; the plumber
    stopped the leak in the kitchen, and made three new ones in worse places;
    and their boss sent the bill to Mrs Aspinall.</p>
  <p>She went to the contractor&rsquo;s yard, and explained that the landlord
    was responsible for the debt, not she. The contractor explained that he had
    seen the landlord, who referred him to her. She called at the landlord&rsquo;s
    private house, and was referred through a servant to the agent. The agent
    was sympathetic, but could do nothing in the matter&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t
    his business; he also asked her to put herself in his place, which she couldn&rsquo;t,
    not being any more reasonable than such women are in such cases. She let
    things drift, being powerless to prevent them from doing so; and the contractor
    sent another bill, then a debt collector and then another bill, then the
    collector again, and threatened to take proceedings, and finally took them.
    To make matters worse, she was two weeks in arrears with the rent, and the
    wood-and-coalman&rsquo;s man (she had dealt with them for ten years) was
    pushing her, as also were her grocers, with whom she had dealt for fifteen
    years and never owed a penny before.</p>
  <p>She waylaid the landlord, and he told her shortly that he couldn&rsquo;t
    build houses and give them away, and keep them in repair afterwards.</p>
  <p>She sought for sympathy and found it, but mostly in the wrong places. It
    was comforting, but unprofitable. Mrs Next-door sympathized warmly, and offered
    to go up as a witness&mdash;she had another landlord. The agent sympathized
    wearily, but not in the presence of witnesses&mdash;he wanted her to put
    herself in his place. Mother Brock, indeed, offered practical assistance,
    which offer was received in breathlessly indignant silence. It was Mother
    Brock who first came to the assistance of Mrs Aspinall&rsquo;s child when
    the plaster accident took place (the mother being absent at the time), and
    when Mrs Aspinall heard of it, her indignation cured her of her fright, and
    she declared to Mrs Next-door that she would give &ldquo;that woman&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
    Mother Brock&mdash;&ldquo;in char-rge the instant she ever <i>dared</i> to
    put her foot inside her (Mrs A.&rsquo;s) respectable door-step again. She
    was a respectable, honest, hard-working woman, and&mdash;&rdquo; etc.</p>
  <p>Whereat Mother Brock laughed good-naturedly. She was a broad-minded bad
    woman, and was right according to <i>her</i> lights. Poor Mrs A. was a respectable,
    haggard woman, and was right according to <i>her</i> lights, and to Mrs Next-door&rsquo;s,
    perfectly so&mdash;they being friends&mdash;and <i>vice versa</i>. None of
    them knew, or would have taken into consideration, the fact that the landlord
    had lost all his money in a burst financial institution, and half his houses
    in the general depression, and depended for food for his family on the somewhat
    doubtful rents of the remainder. So they were all right according to their
    different lights.</p>
  <p>Mrs Aspinall even sought sympathy of &ldquo;John,&rdquo; the Chinaman (with
    whom she had dealt for four months only), and got it. He also, in all simplicity,
    took a hint that wasn&rsquo;t intended. He said: &ldquo;Al li&rsquo;. Pay
    bimeby. Nexy time Flyday. Me tlust.&rdquo; Then he departed with his immortalized
    smile. It would almost appear that he was wrong&mdash;according to our idea
    of Chinese lights.</p>
  <p>Mrs Aspinall went to the court&mdash;it was a small local court. Mrs Next-door
    was awfully sorry, but she couldn&rsquo;t possibly get out that morning.
    The contractor had the landlord up as a witness. The landlord and the P.M.
    nodded pleasantly to each other, and wished each other good morning.... Verdict
    for plaintiff with costs... Next case!... &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take up
    the time of the court, my good woman.&rdquo;.. &ldquo;Now, constable!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Arder
    in the court!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Now, my good woman,&rdquo; said the policeman
    in an undertone, &ldquo;you must go out; there&rsquo;s another case on-come
    now.&rdquo; And he steered her&mdash;but not unkindly&mdash;through the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good woman&rdquo; stood in the crowd outside, and looked wildly
    round for a sympathetic face that advertised sympathetic ears. But others
    had their own troubles, and avoided her. She wanted someone to relieve her
    bursting heart to; she couldn&rsquo;t wait till she got home.</p>
  <p>Even &ldquo;John&rsquo;s&rdquo; attentive ear and mildly idiotic expression
    would have been welcome, but he was gone. He <i>had</i> been in court that
    morning, and had won a small debt case, and had departed cheerfully, under
    the impression that he lost it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;aw Mrs Aspinall, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She started, and looked round. He was one of those sharp, blue or grey-eyed,
    sandy or freckled complexioned boys-of-the-world whom we meet everywhere
    and at all times, who are always going on towards twenty, yet never seem
    to get clear out of their teens, who know more than most of us have forgotten,
    who understand human nature instinctively&mdash;perhaps unconsciously&mdash;and
    are instinctively sympathetic and diplomatic; whose satire is quick, keen,
    and dangerous, and whose tact is often superior to that of many educated
    men-of-the-world. Trained from childhood in the great school of poverty,
    they are full of the pathos and humour of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; can&rsquo;t say I do. I fancy I&rsquo;ve seen your face before
    somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was at your place when little Arvie died. I used to work with him
    at Grinder Brothers&rsquo;, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, of course I remember you! What was I thinking about? I&rsquo;ve
    had such a lot of worry lately that I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m
    on my head or my heels. Besides, you&rsquo;ve grown since then, and changed
    a lot. You&rsquo;re Billy&mdash;Billy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Billy Anderson&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course! To be sure! I remember you quite well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ve you been gettin&rsquo; on, Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Don&rsquo;t mention it&mdash;nothing but worry and trouble&mdash;nothing
    but worry and trouble. This grinding poverty! I&rsquo;ll never have anything
    else but worry and trouble and misery so long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you live in Jones&rsquo;s Alley yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not bin there ever since, have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I shifted away once, but I went back again. I was away nearly
    two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought so, because I called to see you there once. Well, I&rsquo;m
    goin&rsquo;  that way now. You goin&rsquo; home, Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go along with you, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. I&rsquo;d be only too glad of company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to walk, Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo; asked Bill, as the tram
    stopped in their way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I can&rsquo;t afford trams now&mdash;times are too hard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry I don&rsquo;t happen to have no tickets on me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mention it. I&rsquo;m well used to walking. I&rsquo;d
    rather walk than ride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They waited till the tram passed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some people&rdquo;&mdash;said Bill, reflectively, but with a tinge
    of indignation in his tone, as they crossed the street&mdash;&ldquo;some
    people can afford to ride in trams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your trouble, Mrs Aspinall&mdash;if it&rsquo;s a fair
    thing to ask?&rdquo; said Bill, as they turned the corner.</p>
  <p>This was all she wanted, and more; and when, about a mile later, she paused
    for breath, he drew a long one, gave a short whistle, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s red-hot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus encouraged, she told her story again, and some parts of it for the
    third and fourth and even fifth time&mdash;and it grew longer, as our stories
    have a painful tendency to do when we re-write them with a view to condensation.</p>
  <p>But Bill heroically repeated that it was &ldquo;red-hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I dealt off the grocer for fifteen years, and the wood-and-coal
    man for ten, and I lived in that house nine years last Easter Monday and
    never owed a penny before,&rdquo; she repeated for the tenth time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a mistake,&rdquo; reflected Bill. &ldquo;I never
    dealt off nobody more&rsquo;n twice in my life.... I heerd you was married
    again, Mrs Aspinall&mdash;if it&rsquo;s a right thing to ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wherever did you hear that? I did get married again&mdash;to my sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you ain&rsquo;t Mrs Aspinall&mdash;if it&rsquo;s a fair thing
    to ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I&rsquo;m known as Mrs Aspinall. They all call me Mrs Aspinall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand. He cleared, didn&rsquo;t he? Run away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;no&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand. He&rsquo;s s&rsquo;posed to be dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s red-hot! So&rsquo;s my old man, and I hope he
    don&rsquo;t resurrect again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, I married my second for the sake of my children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great mistake,&rdquo; reflected Bill. &ldquo;My mother
    married my step-father for the sake of me, and she&rsquo;s never been done
    telling me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! Did <i>your</i> mother get married again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And he left me with a batch of step-sisters and step-brothers
    to look after, as well as mother; as if things wasn&rsquo;t bad enough before.
    We didn&rsquo;t want no help to be pinched, and poor, and half-starved. I
    don&rsquo;t see where my sake comes in at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s your mother now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right, thank you. She&rsquo;s got a hard time
    of it, but she&rsquo;s pretty well used to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And are you still working at Grinder Brothers&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I got tired of slavin&rsquo; there for next to nothing. I got
    sick of my step-father waitin&rsquo; outside for me on pay-day, with a dirty,
    drunken, spieler pal of his waitin&rsquo; round the corner for him. There
    wasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; in it. It got to be too rough altogether.... Blast
    Grinders!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what are you doing now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sellin&rsquo; papers. I&rsquo;m always tryin&rsquo; to get a start
    in somethin&rsquo; else, but I ain&rsquo;t got no luck. I always come back
    to, sellin&rsquo; papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, after a thought, he added reflectively: &ldquo;Blast papers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His present ambition was to drive a cart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I drove a cart twice, and once I rode a butcher&rsquo;s horse. A
    bloke worked me out of one billet, and I worked myself out of the other.
    I didn&rsquo;t know when I was well off. Then the banks went bust, and my
    last boss went insolvent, and one of his partners went into Darlinghurst
    for suicide, and the other went into Gladesville for being mad; and one day
    the bailiff seized the cart and horse with me in it and a load of timber.
    So I went home and helped mother and the kids to live on one meal a day for
    six months, and keep the bum-bailiff out. Another cove had my news-stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, after a thought &ldquo;Blast reconstriction!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you surely can&rsquo;t make a living selling newspapers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; in it. There&rsquo;s too many at
    it. The blessed women spoil it. There&rsquo;s one got a good stand down in
    George Street, and she&rsquo;s got a dozen kids sellin&rsquo;&mdash;they
    can&rsquo;t be all hers&mdash;and then she&rsquo;s got the hide to come up
    to my stand and sell in front of me.... What are you thinkin&rsquo; about
    doin&rsquo;,
    Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t
    know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And there still being some distance to go, she plunged into her tale of
    misery once more, not forgetting the length of time she had dealt with her
    creditors.</p>
  <p>Bill pushed his hat forward and walked along on the edge of the kerb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you shift? Ain&rsquo;t you got no people or friends that
    you can go to for a while?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; there&rsquo;s my sister-in-law; she&rsquo;s asked me times
    without number to come and stay with her till things got better, and she&rsquo;s
    got a hard enough struggle herself, Lord knows. She asked me again only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that ain&rsquo;t too bad,&rdquo; reflected Bill. &ldquo;Why
    don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you see, if I did they wouldn&rsquo;t let me take my furniture,
    and she&rsquo;s got next to none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the landlord let you take your furniture?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not him! He&rsquo;s one of the hardest landlords in Sydney&mdash;the
    worst I ever had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s red-hot!... I&rsquo;d take it in spite of him. He can&rsquo;t
    do nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I daren&rsquo;t; and even if I did I haven&rsquo;t got a penny
    to pay for a van.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They neared the alley. Bill counted the flagstones, stepping from one to
    another over the joints. &ldquo;Eighteen-nineteen-twenty-twenty-one!&rdquo; he
    counted mentally, and came to the corner kerbing. Then he turned suddenly
    and faced her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do,&rdquo; he said decidedly. &ldquo;Can
    you get your things ready by to-night? I know a cove that&rsquo;s got a cart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I daren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m afraid of the landlord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The more fool you,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not afraid
    of him. He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not afraid of a landlady,
    and that&rsquo;s worse. I know the law. He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;.
    You just do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d want to think over it first, and see my sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where does your sister-&rsquo;n-law live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, see her, and think over it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got plenty of
    time to do it in&mdash;and get your things ready by dark. Don&rsquo;t be
    frightened. I&rsquo;ve shifted mother and an aunt and two married sisters
    out of worse fixes than yours. I&rsquo;ll be round after dark, and bring
    a push to lend a hand. They&rsquo;re decent coves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t expect your friend to shift me for nothing. I told
    you I haven&rsquo;t got a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs Aspinall, I ain&rsquo;t that sort of a bloke, neither is my chum,
    and neither is the other fellows&mdash;&rsquo;relse they wouldn&rsquo;t be
    friends of mine. Will you promise, Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to keep my few things
    now. I&rsquo;ve kept them so long. It&rsquo;s hard to lose my few bits of
    things&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t care so much if I could keep the ironin&rsquo; table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you could, by law&mdash;it&rsquo;s necessary to your living, but
    it would cost more&rsquo;n the table. Now, don&rsquo;t be soft, Mrs Aspinall.
    You&rsquo;ll have the bailiff in any day, and be turned out in the end without
    a rag. The law knows no &lsquo;necessary.&rsquo; You want your furniture
    more&rsquo;n the landlord does. He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;. You can
    trust it all to me.... I knowed Arvie.... Will you do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At about eight o&rsquo;clock that evening there came a mysterious knock
    at Mrs Aspinall&rsquo;s door. She opened, and there stood Bill. His attitude
    was business-like, and his manner very impressive. Three other boys stood
    along by the window, with their backs to the wall, deeply interested in the
    emptying of burnt cigarette-ends into a piece of newspaper laid in the crown
    of one of their hats, and a fourth stood a little way along the kerb casually
    rolling a cigarette, and keeping a quiet eye out for suspicious appearances.
    They were of different makes and sizes, but there seemed an undefined similarity
    between them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is my push, Mrs Aspinall,&rdquo; said Bill; &ldquo;at least,&rdquo; he
    added apologetically,  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s part of &rsquo;em. Here, you chaps,
    this is Mrs Aspinall, what I told you about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They elbowed the wall back, rubbed their heads with their hats, shuffled
    round, and seemed to take a vacant sort of interest in abstract objects,
    such as the pavement, the gas-lamp, and neighbouring doors and windows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got the things ready?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got &rsquo;em downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no upstairs. The rooms above belong to the next house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And a nice house it is,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;for rooms to belong
    to. I wonder,&rdquo;  he reflected, cocking his eye at the windows above; &ldquo;I
    wonder how the police manage to keep an eye on the next house without keepin&rsquo; an
    eye on yours&mdash;but they know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned towards the street end of the alley and gave a low whistle. Out
    under the lamp from behind the corner came a long, thin, shambling, hump-backed
    youth, with his hat down over his head like an extinguisher, dragging a small
    bony horse, which, in its turn, dragged a rickety cart of the tray variety,
    such as is used in the dead marine trade. Behind the cart was tied a mangy
    retriever. This affair was drawn up opposite the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cove with a cart&rdquo; was introduced as &lsquo;Chinny&rsquo;.
    He had no chin whatever, not even a receding chin. It seemed as though his
    chin had been cut clean off horizontally. When he took off his hat he showed
    to the mild surprise of strangers a pair of shrewd grey eyes and a broad
    high forehead. Chinny was in the empty bottle line.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, then, hold up that horse of yours for a minute, Chinny,&rdquo; said
    Bill briskly, &ldquo;&rsquo;relse he&rsquo;ll fall down and break the shaft
    again.&rdquo; (It had already been broken in several places and spliced with
    strips of deal, clothes-line, and wire.) &ldquo;Now, you chaps, fling yourselves
    about and get the furniture out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was a great relief to the push. They ran against each other and the
    door-post in their eagerness to be at work. The furniture&mdash;what Mrs
    A. called her &ldquo;few bits of things&rdquo;&mdash;was carried out with
    elaborate care. The ironing table was the main item. It was placed top down
    in the cart, and the rest of the things went between the legs without bulging
    sufficiently to cause Chinny any anxiety.</p>
  <p>Just then the picket gave a low, earnest whistle, and they were aware of
    a policeman standing statue-like under the lamp on the opposite corner, and
    apparently unaware of their existence. He was looking, sphinx-like, past
    them towards the city.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped; we must put on front an&rsquo; go on with
    it now,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, I think,&rdquo; said Chinny. &ldquo;He knows
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Bill; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    mind him, Mrs Aspinall. Now, then (to the push), tie up. Don&rsquo;t be frightened
    of the dorg-what are you frightened of? Why! he&rsquo;d only apologize if
    you trod on his tail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dog went under the cart, and kept his tail carefully behind him.</p>
  <p>The policeman&mdash;he was an elderly man&mdash;stood still, looking towards
    the city, and over it, perhaps, and over the sea, to long years agone in
    Ireland when he and the boys ducked bailiffs, and resisted evictions with &ldquo;shticks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;riz&rdquo;  sometimes,
    and gathered together at the rising of the moon, and did many things contrary
    to the peace of Gracious Majesty, its laws and constitutions, crown and dignity;
    as a reward for which he had helped to preserve the said peace for the best
    years of his life, without promotion; for he had a great aversion to running
    in &ldquo;the boys&rdquo;&mdash;which included nearly all mankind&mdash;and
    preferred to keep, and was most successful in keeping, the peace with no
    other assistance than that of his own rich fatherly brogue.</p>
  <p>Bill took charge of two of the children; Mrs Aspinall carried the youngest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Chinny,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>Chinny shambled forward, sideways, dragging the horse, with one long, bony,
    short-sleeved arm stretched out behind holding the rope reins; the horse
    stumbled out of the gutter, and the cart seemed to pause a moment, as if
    undecided whether to follow or not, and then, with many rickety complaints,
    moved slowly and painfully up on to the level out of the gutter. The dog
    rose with a long, weary, mangy sigh, but with a lazy sort of calculation,
    before his rope (which was short) grew taut&mdash;which was good judgment
    on his part, for his neck was sore; and his feet being tender, he felt his
    way carefully and painfully over the metal, as if he feared that at any step
    he might spring some treacherous, air-trigger trap-door which would drop
    and hang him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nit, you chaps,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;and wait for me.&rdquo; The
    push rubbed its head with its hat, said &ldquo;Good night, Mrs Ashpennel,&rdquo; and
    was absent, spook-like.</p>
  <p>When the funeral reached the street, the lonely &ldquo;trap&rdquo; was,
    somehow, two blocks away in the opposite direction, moving very slowly, and
    very upright, and very straight, like an automaton.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BrummyUsen"></a>&ldquo;Brummy Usen&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>We caught up with an old swagman crossing the plain, and tramped along with
    him till we came to good shade to have a smoke in. We had got yarning about
    men getting lost in the bush or going away and being reported dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old &lsquo;whaler&rsquo;, as he dropped his
    swag in the shade, sat down on it, and felt for his smoking tackle, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    scarcely an old bushman alive&mdash;or dead, for the matter of that&mdash;who
    hasn&rsquo;t been dead a few times in his life&mdash;or reported dead, which
    amounts to the same thing for a while. In my time there was as many live
    men in the bush who was supposed to be dead as there was dead men who was
    supposed to be alive&mdash;though it&rsquo;s the other way about now&mdash;what
    with so many jackaroos tramping about out back and getting lost in the dry
    country that they don&rsquo;t know anything about, and dying within a few
    yards of water sometimes. But even now, whenever I hear that an old bush
    mate of mine is dead, I don&rsquo;t fret about it or put a black band round
    my hat, because I know he&rsquo;ll be pretty sure to turn up sometimes, pretty
    bad with the booze, and want to borrow half a crown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dead a few times myself, and found out afterwards
    that my friends was so sorry about it, and that I was such a good sort of
    a chap after all, when I was dead that&mdash;that I was sorry I didn&rsquo;t
    stop dead. You see, I was one of them chaps that&rsquo;s better treated by
    their friends and better thought of when&mdash;when they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! Never mind.... Talking of killing bushmen before their
    time reminds me of some cases I knew. They mostly happened among the western
    spurs of the ranges. There was a bullock-driver named Billy Nowlett. He had
    a small selection, where he kept his family, and used to carry from the railway
    terminus to the stations up-country. One time he went up with a load and
    was not heard of for such a long time that his missus got mighty uneasy;
    and then she got a letter from a publican up Coonamble way to say that Billy
    was dead. Someone wrote, for the widow, to ask about the wagon and the bullocks,
    but the shanty-keeper wrote that Billy had drunk them before he died, and
    that he&rsquo;d also to say that he&rsquo;d drunk the money he got for the
    carrying; and the publican enclosed a five-pound note for the widow&mdash;which
    was considered very kind of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the widow struggled along and managed without her husband just
    the same as she had always struggled along and managed with him&mdash;a little
    better, perhaps. An old digger used to drop in of evenings and sit by the
    widow&rsquo;s fire, and yarn, and sympathize, and smoke, and think; and just
    as he began to yarn a lot less, and smoke and think a lot more, Billy Nowlett
    himself turned up with a load of rations for a sheep station. He&rsquo;d
    been down by the other road, and the letter he&rsquo;d wrote to his missus
    had gone astray. Billy wasn&rsquo;t surprised to hear that he was dead&mdash;he&rsquo;d
    been killed before&mdash;but he was surprised about the five quid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, it must have been another bullock-driver that died. There
    was an old shanty-keeper up Coonamble way, so Billy said, that used to always
    mistake him for another bullocky and mistake the other bullocky for him&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
    tell the one from the other no way&mdash;and he used to have bills against
    Billy that the other bullock-driver&rsquo;d run up, and bills against the
    other that Billy&rsquo;d run up, and generally got things mixed up in various
    ways, till Billy wished that one of &rsquo;em was dead. And the funniest
    part of the business was that Billy wasn&rsquo;t no more like the other man
    than chalk is like cheese. You&rsquo;ll often drop across some colour-blind
    old codger that can&rsquo;t tell the difference between two people that ain&rsquo;t
    got a bit of likeness between &rsquo;em.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there was young Joe Swallow. He was found dead under a burned-down
    tree in Dead Man&rsquo;s Gully&mdash;&lsquo;dead past all recognition,&rsquo; they
    said&mdash;and he was buried there, and by and by his ghost began to haunt
    the gully: at least, all the schoolkids seen it, and there was scarcely a
    grown-up person who didn&rsquo;t know another person who&rsquo;d seen the
    ghost&mdash;and the other person was always a sober chap that wouldn&rsquo;t
    bother about telling a lie. But just as the ghost was beginning to settle
    down to work in the gully, Joe himself turned up, and then the folks began
    to reckon that it was another man was killed there, and that the ghost belonged
    to the other man; and some of them began to recollect that they&rsquo;d thought
    all along that the ghost wasn&rsquo;t Joe&rsquo;s ghost&mdash;even when they
    thought that it was really Joe that was killed there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, again, there was the case of Brummy Usen&mdash;Hughison I think
    they spelled it&mdash;the bushranger; he was shot by old Mr S&mdash;, of
    E&mdash;, while trying to stick the old gentleman up. There&rsquo;s something
    about it in a book called &lsquo;Robbery Under Arms&rsquo;, though the names
    is all altered&mdash;and some other time I&rsquo;ll tell you all about the
    digging of the body up for the inquest and burying it again. This Brummy
    used to work for a publican in a sawmill that the publican had; and this
    publican and his daughter identified the body by a woman holding up a branch
    tattooed on the right arm. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about that another time.
    This girl remembered how she used to watch this tattooed woman going up and
    down on Brummy&rsquo;s arm when he was working in the saw-pit&mdash;going
    up and down and up and down, like this, while Brummy was working his end
    of the saw. So the bushranger was inquested and justifiable-homicided as
    Brummy Usen, and buried again in his dust and blood stains and monkey-jacket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the same it wasn&rsquo;t him; for the real Brummy turned up later
    on; but he couldn&rsquo;t make the people believe he wasn&rsquo;t dead. They
    was mostly English country people from Kent and Yorkshire and those places;
    and the most self-opinionated and obstinate people that ever lived when they
    got a thing into their heads; and they got it into their heads that Brummy
    Usen was shot while trying to bail up old Mr S&mdash; and was dead
    and buried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the wife of the publican that had the saw-pit knew him; he went
    to her, and she recognized him at once; she&rsquo;d got it into her head
    from the first that it wasn&rsquo;t Brummy that was shot, and she stuck to
    it&mdash;she was just as self-opinionated as the neighbours, and many a barney
    she had with them about it. She would argue about it till the day she died,
    and then she said with her dying breath: &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Brummy Usen.&rsquo; No
    more it was&mdash;he was a different kind of man; he hadn&rsquo;t spunk enough
    to be a bushranger, and it was a better man that was buried for him; it was
    a different kind of woman, holding up a different kind of branch, that was
    tattooed on Brummy&rsquo;s arm. But, you see, Brummy&rsquo;d always kept
    himself pretty much to himself, and no one knew him very well; and, besides,
    most of them were pretty drunk at the inquest&mdash;except the girl, and
    she was too scared to know what she was saying&mdash;they had to be so because
    the corpse was in such a bad state.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Brummy hung around for a time, and tried to prove that he wasn&rsquo;t
    an impostor, but no one wouldn&rsquo;t believe him. He wanted to get some
    wages that was owing to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He tried the police, but they were just as obstinate as the rest;
    and, beside, they had their dignity to hold up. &lsquo;If I ain&rsquo;t Brummy,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d
    say,  &lsquo;who are I?&rsquo; But they answered that he knew best. So he
    did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last he said that it didn&rsquo;t matter much, any road; and so
    he went away&mdash;Lord knows where&mdash;to begin life again, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The traveller smoked awhile reflectively; then he quietly rolled up his
    right sleeve and scratched his arm.</p>
  <p>And on that arm we saw the tattooed figure of a woman, holding up a branch.</p>
  <p>We tramped on by his side again towards the station&mdash;thinking very hard and
    not feeling very comfortable.</p>
  <p>He must have been an awful old liar, now we come to think of it</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BoggOfGeebung"></a>Bogg Of Geebung</b></h2>
  <p>At the local police court, where the subject of this sketch turned up periodically
    amongst the drunks, he had &ldquo;James&rdquo; prefixed to his name for the
    sake of convenience and as a matter of form previous to his being fined forty
    shillings (which he never paid) and sentenced to &ldquo;a month hard&rdquo; (which
    he contrived to make as soft as possible). The local larrikins called him &ldquo;Grog,&rdquo; a
    very appropriate name, all things considered; but to the Geebung Times he
    was known until the day of his death as &ldquo;a well-known character named
    Bogg.&rdquo; The antipathy of the local paper might have been accounted for
    by the fact that Bogg strayed into the office one day in a muddled condition
    during the absence of the staff at lunch and corrected a revise proof of
    the next week&rsquo;s leader, placing bracketed &ldquo;query&rdquo; and &ldquo;see
    proof&rdquo;  marks opposite the editor&rsquo;s most flowery periods and
    quotations, and leaving on the margin some general advice to the printers
    to &ldquo;space better.&rdquo; He also corrected a Latin quotation or two,
    and added a few ideas of his own in good French.</p>
  <p>But no one, with the exception of the editor of the Times, ever dreamed
    that there was anything out of the common in the shaggy, unkempt head upon
    which poor Bogg used to &ldquo;do his little time,&rdquo; until a young English
    doctor came to practise at Geebung. One night the doctor and the manager
    of the local bank and one or two others wandered into the bar of the Diggers&rsquo; Arms,
    where Bogg sat in a dark corner mumbling to himself as usual and spilling
    half his beer on the table and floor. Presently some drunken utterances reached
    the doctor&rsquo;s ear, and he turned round in a surprised manner and looked
    at Bogg. The drunkard continued to mutter for some time, and then broke out
    into something like the fag-end of a song. The doctor walked over to the
    table at which Bogg was sitting, and, seating himself on the far corner,
    regarded the drunkard attentively for some minutes; but the latter&rsquo;s
    voice ceased, his head fell slowly on his folded arms, and all became silent
    except the drip, drip of the overturned beer falling from the table to the
    form and from the form to the floor.</p>
  <p>The doctor rose and walked back to his friends with a graver face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem interested in Bogg,&rdquo; said the bank manager.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was he mumbling about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that was a passage from Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor repeated his answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then do you mean to say he understands Greek?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, sadly; &ldquo;he is, or must have been,
    a classical scholar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The manager took time to digest this, and then asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was the song?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that was an old song we used to sing at the Dublin University,&rdquo;  said
    the doctor.</p>
  <p>During his sober days Bogg used to fossick about among the old mullock heaps,
    or split palings in the bush, and just managed to keep out of debt. Strange
    to say, in spite of his drunken habits, his credit was as good as that of
    any man in the town. He was very unsociable, seldom speaking, whether drunk
    or sober; but a weary, hard-up sundowner was always pretty certain to get
    a meal and a shake-down at Bogg&rsquo;s lonely hut among the mullock heaps.
    It happened one dark night that a little push of local larrikins, having
    nothing better to amuse them, wended their way through the old mullock heaps
    in the direction of the lonely little bark hut, with the object of playing
    off an elaborately planned ghost joke on Bogg. Prior to commencing operations,
    the leader of the jokers put his eye to a crack in the bark to reconnoitre.
    He didn&rsquo;t see much, but what he did see seemed to interest him, for
    he kept his eye there till his mates grew impatient. Bogg sat in front of
    his rough little table with his elbows on the same, and his hands supporting
    his forehead. Before him on the table lay a few articles such as lady novelists
    and poets use in their work, and such as bitter cynics often wear secretly
    next their bitter, cynical hearts.</p>
  <p>There was the usual faded letter, a portrait of a girl, something that looked
    like a pressed flower, and, of course, a lock of hair. Presently Bogg folded
    his arms over these things, and his face sank lower and lower, till nothing
    was visible to the unsuspected watcher except the drunkard&rsquo;s rough,
    shaggy hair; rougher and wilder looking in the uncertain light of the slush-lamp.</p>
  <p>The larrikin turned away, and beckoned his comrades to follow him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot is it?&rdquo; asked one, when they had gone some distance. The
    leader said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; ter let &rsquo;im alone; that&rsquo;s
    wot it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was some demur at this, and an explanation was demanded; but the boss
    bully unbuttoned his coat, and spat on his hands, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; ter let Bogg alone; that&rsquo;s wot it
    is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So they went away and let Bogg alone.</p>
  <p>A few days later the following paragraph appeared in the <i>Geebung Times</i>: &ldquo;A
    well-known character named Bogg was found drowned in the river on Sunday
    last, his hat and coat being found on the bank. At a late hour on Saturday
    night a member of our staff saw a man walking slowly along the river bank,
    but it was too dark to identify the person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We suppose it was Bogg whom the <i>Times</i> reported, but of course we
    cannot be sure. The chances are that it was Bogg. It was pretty evident that
    he had committed suicide, and being &ldquo;a well-known character,&rdquo; no
    doubt he had reasons for his rash act. Perhaps he was walking by himself
    in the dark along the river bank, and thinking of those reasons when the <i>Times</i> man
    saw him. Strange to say, the world knows least about the lives and sorrows
    of &ldquo;well-known characters&rdquo;  of this kind, no matter what their
    names might be, and&mdash;well, there is no reason why we should bore a reader,
    or waste any more space over a well-known character named Bogg.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SheWouldntSpeak"></a>She Wouldn&rsquo;t Speak</b></h2>
  <p>Well, we reached the pub about dinner-time, dropped our swags outside, had
    a drink, and then went into the dinin&rsquo;-room. There was a lot of jackaroo
    swells, that had been on a visit to the squatter, or something, and they
    were sittin&rsquo; down at dinner; and they seemed to think by their looks
    that we ought to have stayed outside and waited till they were done&mdash;we
    was only two rough shearers, you know. There was a very good-looking servant
    girl waitin&rsquo; on &rsquo;em, and she was all smiles&mdash;laughin&rsquo;,
    and jokin&rsquo;, and chyackin&rsquo;, and barrickin&rsquo; with &rsquo;em
    like anything.</p>
  <p>I thought a damp expression seemed to pass across her face when me and my
    mate sat down, but she served us and said nothing&mdash;we was only two dusty
    swaggies, you see. Dave said &ldquo;Good day&rdquo; to her when we came in,
    but she didn&rsquo;t answer; and I could see from the first that she&rsquo;d
    made up her mind not to speak to us.</p>
  <p>The swells finished, and got up and went out, leaving me and Dave and the
    servant girl alone in the room; but she didn&rsquo;t open her mouth&mdash;not
    once. Dave winked at her once or twice as she handed his cup, but it wasn&rsquo;t
    no go. Dave was a good-lookin&rsquo; chap, too; but we couldn&rsquo;t get
    her to say a word&mdash;not one.</p>
  <p>We finished the first blanky course, and, while she was gettin&rsquo; our
    puddin&rsquo; from the side-table, Dave says to me in a loud whisper, so&rsquo;s
    she could hear:  &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she a stunner, Joe! I never thought there
    was sich fine girls on the Darlin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But no; she wouldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
  <p>Then Dave says: &ldquo;They pitch a blanky lot about them New Englan&rsquo; gals;
    but I&rsquo;ll back the Darlin&rsquo; girls to lick &rsquo;em holler as far&rsquo;s
    looks is concerned,&rdquo;  says Dave.</p>
  <p>But no; she wouldn&rsquo;t speak. She wouldn&rsquo;t even smile. Dave didn&rsquo;t
    say nothing for awhile, and then he said: &ldquo;Did you hear about that
    red-headed barmaid at Stiffner&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be married to the bank
    manager at Bourke next month, Joe?&rdquo;  says Dave.</p>
  <p>But no, not a single word out of her; she didn&rsquo;t even look up, or
    look as if she wanted to speak.</p>
  <p>Dave scratched his ear and went on with his puddin&rsquo; for awhile. Then
    he said: &ldquo;Joe, did you hear that yarn about young Scotty and old whatchisname&rsquo;s
    missus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;but I think it was the daughter, not the
    wife, and young Scotty,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t no go; that girl wouldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
  <p>Dave shut up for a good while, but presently I says to Dave &ldquo;I see
    that them hoops is comin&rsquo; in again, Dave. The paper says that this
    here Lady Duff had one on when she landed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard about it,&rdquo; says Dave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
    see my wife in one, but I s&rsquo;pose a woman must wear what all the rest
    does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And do you think that girl would speak? Not a blanky word.</p>
  <p>We finished our second puddin&rsquo; and fourth cup of tea, and I was just
    gettin&rsquo; up when Dave catches holt on my arm, like that, and pulls me
    down into my chair again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Old on,&rdquo; whispers Dave; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
    make that blanky gal speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bet you a five-pound note,&rdquo; says Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>So I sits down again, and Dave whistles to the girl, and he passes along
    his cup and mine. She filled &rsquo;em at once, without a word, and we got
    outside our fifth cup of tea each. Then Dave jingled his spoon, and passed
    both cups along again. She put some hot water in the pot this time, and,
    after we&rsquo;d drunk another couple of cups, Dave muttered somethin&rsquo; about
    drownin&rsquo; the miller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We want tea, not warm water,&rdquo; he growled, lookin&rsquo; sulky
    and passin&rsquo;  along both cups again.</p>
  <p>But she never opened her mouth; she wouldn&rsquo;t speak. She didn&rsquo;t
    even, look cross. She made a fresh pot of tea, and filled our cups again.
    She didn&rsquo;t even slam the cups down, or swamp the tea over into the
    saucers&mdash;which would have been quite natural, considerin&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about done,&rdquo; I said to Dave in a low whisper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
    have to give it up, I&rsquo;m afraid, Dave,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make her speak, or bust myself,&rdquo; says Dave.</p>
  <p>And I&rsquo;m blest if he didn&rsquo;t go on till I was so blanky full of
    tea that it brimmed over and run out the corners of my mouth; and Dave was
    near as bad. At last I couldn&rsquo;t drink another teaspoonful without holding
    back my head, and then I couldn&rsquo;t keep it down, but had to let it run
    back into the blanky cup again. The girl began to clear away at the other
    end of the table, and now and then she&rsquo;d lay her hand on the teapot
    and squint round to see if we wanted any more tea. But she never spoke. She
    might have thought a lot&mdash;but she never opened her lips.</p>
  <p>I tell you, without a word of a lie, that we must have drunk about a dozen
    cups each. We made her fill the teapot twice, and kept her waitin&rsquo; nearly
    an hour, but we couldn&rsquo;t make her say a word. She never said a single
    word to us from the time we came in till the time we went out, nor before
    nor after. She&rsquo;d made up her mind from the first not to speak to us.</p>
  <p>We had to get up and leave our cups half full at last. We went out and sat
    down on our swags in the shade against the wall, and smoked and gave that
    tea time to settle, and then we got on to the track again.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGeologicalSpieler"></a>The Geological Spieler</b></h2>
  <p class="note">There&rsquo;s nothing so interesting as Geology, even to common and ignorant
    people, especially when you have a bank or the side of a cutting, studded
    with fossil fish and things and oysters that were stale when Adam was fresh
    to illustrate by. <i>&nbsp;(Remark made by Steelman, professional wanderer,
    to his pal and pupil, Smith.)</i></p>
  <p>The first man that Steelman and Smith came up to on the last embankment,
    where they struck the new railway line, was a heavy, gloomy, labouring man
    with bowyangs on and straps round his wrists. Steelman bade him the time
    of day and had a few words with him over the weather. The man of mullock
    gave it as his opinion that the fine weather wouldn&rsquo;t last, and seemed
    to take a gloomy kind of pleasure in that reflection; he said there was more
    rain down yonder, pointing to the southeast, than the moon could swallow
    up&mdash;the moon was in its first quarter, during which time it is popularly
    believed in some parts of Maoriland that the south-easter is most likely
    to be out on the wallaby and the weather bad. Steelman regarded that quarter
    of the sky with an expression of gentle remonstrance mingled as it were with
    a sort of fatherly indulgence, agreed mildly with the labouring man, and
    seemed lost for a moment in a reverie from which he roused himself to inquire
    cautiously after the boss. There was no boss, it was a co-operative party.
    That chap standing over there by the dray in the end of the cutting was their
    spokesman&mdash;their representative: they called him boss, but that was
    only his nickname in camp. Steelman expressed his thanks and moved on towards
    the cutting, followed respectfully by Smith.</p>
  <p>Steelman wore a snuff-coloured sac suit, a wide-awake hat, a pair of professional-looking
    spectacles, and a scientific expression; there was a clerical atmosphere
    about him, strengthened, however, by an air as of unconscious dignity and
    superiority, born of intellect and knowledge. He carried a black bag, which
    was an indispensable article in his profession in more senses than one. Smith
    was decently dressed in sober tweed and looked like a man of no account,
    who was mechanically devoted to his employer&rsquo;s interests, pleasures,
    or whims.</p>
  <p>The boss was a decent-looking young fellow, with a good face&mdash;rather
    solemn&mdash;and a quiet manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; said Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; said the boss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice weather this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, but I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid it will not by the look of the sky down there,&rdquo; ventured
    Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I go mostly by the look of our weather prophet,&rdquo; said the
    boss with a quiet smile, indicating the gloomy man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose bad weather would put you back in your work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it will; we didn&rsquo;t want any bad weather just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman got the weather question satisfactorily settled; then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be getting on with the railway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, we are about over the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worst of it?&rdquo; echoed Steelman, with mild surprise: &ldquo;I
    should have thought you were just coming into it,&rdquo; and he pointed to
    the ridge ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, our section doesn&rsquo;t go any further than that pole you see
    sticking up yonder. We had the worst of it back there across the swamps&mdash;working
    up to our waists in water most of the time, in midwinter too&mdash;and at
    eighteenpence a yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, rather rough. Did you come from the terminus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I sent my baggage on in the brake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Commercial traveller, I suppose?&rdquo; asked the boss, glancing
    at Smith, who stood a little to the rear of Steelman, seeming interested
    in the work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Steelman, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;I am&mdash;well&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    a geologist; this is my man here,&rdquo; indicating Smith. &ldquo;(You may
    put down the bag, James, and have a smoke.) My name is Stoneleigh&mdash;you
    might have heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss said, &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and then presently he added &ldquo;indeed,&rdquo; in
    an undecided tone.</p>
  <p>There was a pause&mdash;embarrassed on the part of the boss&mdash;he was
    silent not knowing what to say. Meanwhile Steelman studied his man and concluded
    that he would do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having a look at the country, I suppose?&rdquo; asked the boss presently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Steelman; then after a moment&rsquo;s reflection: &ldquo;I
    am travelling for my own amusement and improvement, and also in the interest
    of science, which amounts to the same thing. I am a member of the Royal Geological
    Society&mdash;vice-president in fact of a leading Australian branch;&rdquo; and
    then, as if conscious that he had appeared guilty of egotism, he shifted
    the subject a bit. &ldquo;Yes. Very interesting country this&mdash;very interesting
    indeed. I should like to make a stay here for a day or so. Your work opens
    right into my hands. I cannot remember seeing a geological formation which
    interested me so much. Look at the face of that cutting, for instance. Why!
    you can almost read the history of the geological world from yesterday&mdash;this
    morning as it were&mdash;beginning with the super-surface on top and going
    right down through the different layers and stratas&mdash;through the vanished
    ages&mdash;right down and back to the pre-historical&mdash;to the very primeval
    or fundamental geological formations!&rdquo; And Steelman studied the face
    of the cutting as if he could read it like a book, with every layer or stratum
    a chapter, and every streak a note of explanation. The boss seemed to be
    getting interested, and Steelman gained confidence and proceeded to identify
    and classify the different &ldquo;stratas and layers,&rdquo; and fix their
    ages, and describe the conditions and politics of man in their different
    times, for the boss&rsquo;s benefit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Steelman, turning slowly from the cutting,
    removing his glasses, and letting his thoughtful eyes wander casually over
    the general scenery&mdash;&ldquo;now the first impression that this country
    would leave on an ordinary intelligent mind&mdash;though maybe unconsciously,
    would be as of a new country&mdash;new in a geological sense; with patches
    of an older geological and vegetable formation cropping out here and there;
    as for instance that clump of dead trees on that clear alluvial slope there,
    that outcrop of limestone, or that timber yonder,&rdquo; and he indicated
    a dead forest which seemed alive and green because of the parasites. &ldquo;But
    the country is old&mdash;old; perhaps the oldest geological formation in
    the world is to be seen here, the oldest vegetable formation in Australasia.
    I am not using the words old and new in an ordinary sense, you understand,
    but in a geological sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss said, &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; and that geology must be a very
    interesting study.</p>
  <p>Steelman ran his eye meditatively over the cutting again, and turning to
    Smith said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go up there, James, and fetch me a specimen of that slaty outcrop
    you see there&mdash;just above the coeval strata.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a stiff climb and slippery, but Smith had to do it, and he did it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Steelman, breaking the rotten piece between his
    fingers,  &ldquo;belongs probably to an older geological period than its
    position would indicate&mdash;a primitive sandstone level perhaps. Its position
    on that layer is no doubt due to volcanic upheavals&mdash;such disturbances,
    or rather the results of such disturbances, have been and are the cause of
    the greatest trouble to geologists&mdash;endless errors and controversy.
    You see we must study the country, not as it appears now, but as it would
    appear had the natural geological growth been left to mature undisturbed;
    we must restore and reconstruct such disorganized portions of the mineral
    kingdom, if you understand me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss said he understood.</p>
  <p>Steelman found an opportunity to wink sharply and severely at Smith, who
    had been careless enough to allow his features to relapse into a vacant grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is generally known even amongst the ignorant that rock grows&mdash;grows
    from the outside&mdash;but the rock here, a specimen of which I hold in my
    hand, is now in the process of decomposition; to be plain it is rotting&mdash;in
    an advanced stage of decomposition&mdash;so much so that you are not able
    to identify it with any geological period or formation, even as you may not
    be able to identify any other extremely decomposed body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss blinked and knitted his brow, but had the presence of mind to say: &ldquo;Just
    so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had the rock on that cutting been healthy&mdash;been alive, as it
    were&mdash;you would have had your work cut out; but it is dead and has been
    dead for ages perhaps. You find less trouble in working it than you would
    ordinary clay or sand, or even gravel, which formations together are really
    rock in embryo&mdash;before birth as it were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss&rsquo;s brow cleared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The country round here is simply rotting down&mdash;simply rotting
    down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He removed his spectacles, wiped them, and wiped his face; then his attention
    seemed to be attracted by some stones at his feet. He picked one up and examined
    it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; he mused, absently, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
    wonder if there is alluvial gold in some of these creeks and gullies, perhaps
    tin or even silver, quite probably antimony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss seemed interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you tell me if there is any place in this neighbourhood where
    I could get accommodation for myself and my servant for a day or two?&rdquo; asked
    Steelman presently. &ldquo;I should very much like to break my journey here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said the boss. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do&mdash;I
    don&rsquo;t know of any place nearer than Pahiatua, and that&rsquo;s seven
    miles from here.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Steelman reflectively, &ldquo;but I fully
    expected to have found a house of accommodation of some sort on the way,
    else I would have gone on in the van.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the boss. &ldquo;If you like to camp with us for
    to night, at least, and don&rsquo;t mind roughing it, you&rsquo;ll be welcome,
    I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I was sure that I would not be putting you to any trouble, or
    interfering in any way with your domestic economy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No trouble at all,&rdquo; interrupted the boss. &ldquo;The boys will
    be only too glad, and there&rsquo;s an empty whare where you can sleep. Better
    stay. It&rsquo;s going to be a rough night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After tea Steelman entertained the boss and a few of the more thoughtful
    members of the party with short chatty lectures on geology and other subjects.</p>
  <p>In the meantime Smith, in another part of the camp, gave selections on a
    tin whistle, sang a song or two, contributed, in his turn, to the sailor
    yarns, and ensured his popularity for several nights at least. After several
    draughts of something that was poured out of a demijohn into a pint-pot,
    his tongue became loosened, and he expressed an opinion that geology was
    all bosh, and said if he had half his employer&rsquo;s money he&rsquo;d be
    dashed if he would go rooting round in the mud like a blessed old ant-eater;
    he also irreverently referred to his learned boss as &ldquo;Old Rocks&rdquo;  over
    there. He had a pretty easy billet of it though, he said, taking it all round,
    when the weather was fine; he got a couple of notes a week and all expenses
    paid, and the money was sure; he was only required to look after the luggage
    and arrange for accommodation, grub out a chunk of rock now and then, and
    (what perhaps was the most irksome of his duties) he had to appear interested
    in old rocks and clay.</p>
  <p>Towards midnight Steelman and Smith retired to the unoccupied whare which
    had been shown them, Smith carrying a bundle of bags, blankets, and rugs,
    which had been placed at their disposal by their good-natured hosts. Smith
    lit a candle and proceeded to make the beds. Steelman sat down, removed his
    specs and scientific expression, placed the glasses carefully on a ledge
    close at hand, took a book from his bag, and commenced to read. The volume
    was a cheap copy of Jules Verne&rsquo;s <i>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</i>.
    A little later there was a knock at the door. Steelman hastily resumed the
    spectacles, together with the scientific expression, took a note-book from
    his pocket, opened it on the table, and said,  &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; One
    of the chaps appeared with a billy of hot coffee, two pint-pots, and some
    cake. He said he thought you chaps might like a drop of coffee before you
    turned in, and the boys had forgot to ask you to wait for it down in the
    camp. He also wanted to know whether Mr Stoneleigh and his man would be all
    right and quite comfortable for the night, and whether they had blankets
    enough. There was some wood at the back of the whare and they could light
    a fire if they liked.</p>
  <p>Mr Stoneleigh expressed his thanks and his appreciation of the kindness
    shown him and his servant. He was extremely sorry to give them any trouble.</p>
  <p>The navvy, a serious man, who respected genius or intellect in any shape
    or form, said that it was no trouble at all, the camp was very dull and the
    boys were always glad to have someone come round. Then, after a brief comparison
    of opinions concerning the probable duration of the weather which had arrived,
    they bade each other good night, and the darkness swallowed the serious man.</p>
  <p>Steelman turned into the top bunk on one side and Smith took the lower on
    the other. Steelman had the candle by his bunk, as usual; he lit his pipe
    for a final puff before going to sleep, and held the light up for a moment
    so as to give Smith the full benefit of a solemn, uncompromising wink. The
    wink was silently applauded and dutifully returned by Smith. Then Steelman
    blew out the light, lay back, and puffed at his pipe for a while. Presently
    he chuckled, and the chuckle was echoed by Smith; by and by Steelman chuckled
    once more, and then Smith chuckled again. There was silence in the darkness,
    and after a bit Smith chuckled twice. Then Steelman said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake give her a rest, Smith, and give a man a show
    to get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the silence in the darkness remained unbroken.</p>
  <p>The invitation was extended next day, and Steelman sent Smith on to see
    that his baggage was safe. Smith stayed out of sight for two or three hours,
    and then returned and reported all well.</p>
  <p>They stayed on for several days. After breakfast and when the men were going
    to work Steelman and Smith would go out along the line with the black bag
    and poke round amongst the &ldquo;layers and stratas&rdquo; in sight of the
    works for a while, as an evidence of good faith; then they&rsquo;d drift
    off casually into the bush, camp in a retired and sheltered spot, and light
    a fire when the weather was cold, and Steelman would lie on the grass and
    read and smoke and lay plans for the future and improve Smith&rsquo;s mind
    until they reckoned it was about dinner-time. And in the evening they would
    come home with the black bag full of stones and bits of rock, and Steelman
    would lecture on those minerals after tea.</p>
  <p>On about the fourth morning Steelman had a yarn with one of the men going
    to work. He was a lanky young fellow with a sandy complexion, and seemingly
    harmless grin. In Australia he might have been regarded as a &ldquo;cove&rdquo; rather
    than a &ldquo;chap,&rdquo; but there was nothing of the &ldquo;bloke&rdquo; about
    him. Presently the cove said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you think of the boss, Mr Stoneleigh? He seems to have taken
    a great fancy for you, and he&rsquo;s fair gone on geology.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think he is a very decent fellow indeed, a very intelligent young
    man. He seems very well read and well informed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think he was a University man,&rdquo; said the
    cove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed! Is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I thought you knew!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman knitted his brows. He seemed slightly disturbed for the moment.
    He walked on a few paces in silence and thought hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What might have been his special line?&rdquo; he asked the cove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, something the same as yours. I thought you knew. He was reckoned
    the best&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;the best minrologist in the country.
    He had a first-class billet in the Mines Department, but he lost it&mdash;you
    know&mdash;the booze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think we will be making a move, Smith,&rdquo; said Steelman, later
    on, when they were private. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little too much intellect
    in this camp to suit me. But we haven&rsquo;t done so bad, anyway. We&rsquo;ve
    had three days&rsquo; good board and lodging with entertainments and refreshments
    thrown in.&rdquo; Then he said to himself: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay for another
    day anyway. If those beggars are having a lark with us, we&rsquo;re getting
    the worth of it anyway, and I&rsquo;m not thin-skinned. They&rsquo;re the
    mugs and not us, anyhow it goes, and I can take them down before I leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But on the way home he had a talk with another man whom we might set down
    as a &ldquo;chap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought the boss was a college man,&rdquo; said
    Steelman to the chap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A University man&mdash;University education.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! Who&rsquo;s been telling you that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of your mates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s been getting at you. Why, it&rsquo;s all the boss
    can do to write his own name. Now that lanky sandy cove with the birth-mark
    grin&mdash;it&rsquo;s him that&rsquo;s had the college education.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll make a start to-morrow,&rdquo; said Steelman
    to Smith in the privacy of their where. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much humour
    and levity in this camp to suit a serious scientific gentleman like myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MacquariesMate"></a>Macquarie&rsquo;s Mate</b></h2>
  <p>The chaps in the bar of Stiffner&rsquo;s shanty were talking about Macquarie,
    an absent shearer&mdash;who seemed, from their conversation, to be better
    known than liked by them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen Macquarie for ever so long,&rdquo; remarked Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks,
    after a pause. &ldquo;Wonder where he could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jail, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps&mdash;or hell,&rdquo; growled Barcoo. &ldquo;He
    ain&rsquo;t much loss, any road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath, yer right, Barcoo!&rdquo; interposed &ldquo;Sally&rdquo; Thompson. &ldquo;But,
    now I come to think of it, Old Awful Example there was a mate of his one
    time. Bless&rsquo;d if the old soaker ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; to life again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shaky, rag-and-dirt-covered framework of a big man rose uncertainly from
    a corner of the room, and, staggering forward, brushed the staring thatch
    back from his forehead with one hand, reached blindly for the edge of the
    bar with the other, and drooped heavily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Awful Example,&rdquo; demanded the shanty-keeper. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    up with you now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The drunkard lifted his head and glared wildly round with bloodshot eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you talk about him! <i>Drop it</i>,
    I say! Drop it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the matter with you now, anyway?&rdquo; growled
    the barman.  &ldquo;Got &rsquo;em again? Hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you talk about Macquarie! He&rsquo;s
    a mate of mine! Here! Gimme a drink!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what if he is a mate of yours?&rdquo; sneered Barcoo. &ldquo;It
    don&rsquo;t reflec&rsquo;  much credit on you&mdash;nor him neither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The logic contained in the last three words was unanswerable, and Awful
    Example was still fairly reasonable, even when rum oozed out of him at every
    pore. He gripped the edge of the bar with both hands, let his ruined head
    fall forward until it was on a level with his temporarily rigid arms, and
    stared blindly at the dirty floor; then he straightened himself up, still
    keeping his hold on the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of you chaps,&rdquo; he said huskily; &ldquo;one of you chaps,
    in this bar to-day, called Macquarie a scoundrel, and a loafer, and a blackguard,
    and&mdash;and a sneak and a liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what if we did?&rdquo; said Barcoo, defiantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    all that, and a cheat into the bargain. And now, what are you going to do
    about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man swung sideways to the bar, rested his elbow on it, and his head
    on his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a sneak and he wasn&rsquo;t a liar,&rdquo; he
    said, in a quiet, tired tone; &ldquo;and Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a cheat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, old man, you needn&rsquo;t get your rag out about it,&rdquo; said
    Sally Thompson, soothingly. &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps we was a bit too hard
    on him; and it isn&rsquo;t altogether right, chaps, considerin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
    not here. But, then, you know, Awful, he might have acted straight to you
    that was his mate. The meanest blank&mdash;if he is a man at all&mdash;will
    do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, to blazes with the old sot!&rdquo; shouted Barcoo. &ldquo;I gave
    my opinion about Macquarie, and, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll stand to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a point for the defence,&rdquo; the
    old man went on, without heeding the interruptions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
    a point or two for the defence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; said Stiffner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the first place&mdash;in the first place, Macquarie never talked
    about no man behind his back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an uneasy movement, and a painful silence. Barcoo reached for
    his drink and drank slowly; he needed time to think&mdash;Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks
    studied his boots&mdash;Sally Thompson looked out at the weather&mdash;the
    shanty-keeper wiped the top of the bar very hard&mdash;and the rest shifted
    round and &ldquo;s&rsquo;posed they&rsquo;d try a game er cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barcoo set his glass down very softly, pocketed his hands deeply and defiantly,
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what of that? Macquarie was as strong as a bull, and the greatest
    bully on the river into the bargain. He could call a man a liar to his face&mdash;and
    smash his face afterwards. And he did it often, too, and with smaller men
    than himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a breath of relief in the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you want to make out that I&rsquo;m talking about a man behind
    his back?&rdquo;  continued Barcoo, threateningly, to Awful Example. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
    best take care, old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a coward,&rdquo; remonstrated the drunkard,
    softly, but in an injured tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you, anyway?&rdquo; yelled the publican. &ldquo;What
    yer growling at? D&rsquo;ye want a row? Get out if yer can&rsquo;t be agreeable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boozer swung his back to the bar, hooked himself on by his elbows, and
    looked vacantly out of the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;another point for the defence,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    always best&mdash;it&rsquo;s always best to keep the last point to&mdash;the
    last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord! Well, out with it! <i>Out with it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Macquarie&rsquo;s dead</i>! That&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everyone moved uneasily: Sally Thompson turned the other side to the bar,
    crossed one leg behind the other, and looked down over his hip at the sole
    and heel of his elastic-side&mdash;the barman rinsed the glasses vigorously&mdash;Longbones
    shuffled and dealt on the top of a cask, and some of the others gathered
    round him and got interested&mdash;Barcoo thought he heard his horse breaking
    away, and went out to see to it, followed by Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks and a couple
    more, who thought that it might be one of their horses.</p>
  <p>Someone&mdash;a tall, gaunt, determined-looking bushman, with square features
    and haggard grey eyes&mdash;had ridden in unnoticed through the scrub to
    the back of the shanty and dismounted by the window.</p>
  <p>When Barcoo and the others re-entered the bar it soon became evident that
    Sally Thompson had been thinking, for presently he came to the general rescue
    as follows:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a blessed lot of tommy-rot about dead people in this
    world&mdash;a lot of damned old-woman nonsense. There&rsquo;s more sympathy
    wasted over dead and rotten skunks than there is justice done to straight,
    honest-livin&rsquo; chaps. I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve in this gory sentiment
    about the dead at the expense of the living. I b&rsquo;lieve in justice for
    the livin&rsquo;&mdash;and the dead too, for that matter&mdash;but justice
    for the livin&rsquo;. Macquarie was a bad egg, and it don&rsquo;t alter the
    case if he was dead a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was another breath of relief in the bar, and presently somebody said: &ldquo;Yer
    right, Sally!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good for you, Sally, old man!&rdquo; cried Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, taking
    it up.  &ldquo;An&rsquo;, besides, I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve Macquarie
    is dead at all. He&rsquo;s always dyin&rsquo;, or being reported dead, and
    then turnin&rsquo; up again. Where did you hear about it, Awful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Example ruefully rubbed a corner of his roof with the palm of his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot in what you say, Sally Thompson,&rdquo; he
    admitted slowly, totally ignoring Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks. &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve had enough of the old fool,&rdquo; yelled Barcoo. &ldquo;Macquarie
    was a spieler, and any man that ud be his mate ain&rsquo;t much better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, take a drink and dry up, yer ole hass!&rdquo; said the man
    behind the bar, pushing a bottle and glass towards the drunkard. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
    want a row?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man took the bottle and glass in his shaking bands and painfully
    poured out a drink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot in what Sally Thompson says,&rdquo; he went on,
    obstinately,  &ldquo;but&mdash;but,&rdquo; he added in a strained tone, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    another point that I near forgot, and none of you seemed to think of it&mdash;not
    even Sally Thompson nor&mdash;nor Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stiffner turned his back, and Barcoo spat viciously and impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drivelled the drunkard, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another
    point for&mdash;for the defence&mdash;of my mate, Macquarie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, out with it! Spit it out, for God&rsquo;s sake, or you&rsquo;ll
    bust!&rdquo; roared Stiffner. &ldquo;What the blazes is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>His mate&rsquo;s alive!</i>&rdquo; yelled the old man. &ldquo;Macquarie&rsquo;s
    mate&rsquo;s alive! That&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00108-images/page322.jpg" width="486" height="750"></p>
  <p>He reeled back from the bar, dashed his glass and hat to the boards, gave
    his pants, a hitch by the waistband that almost lifted him off his feet,
    and tore at his shirt-sleeves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make a ring, boys,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;His mate&rsquo;s alive!
    Put up your hands, Barcoo! By God, his mate&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Someone had turned his horse loose at the rear and had been standing by
    the back door for the last five minutes. Now he slipped quietly in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep the old fool off, or he&rsquo;ll get hurt,&rdquo; snarled Barcoo.</p>
  <p>Stiffner jumped the counter. There were loud, hurried words of remonstrance,
    then some stump-splitting oaths and a scuffle, consequent upon an attempt
    to chuck the old man out. Then a crash. Stiffner and Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks
    were down, two others were holding Barcoo back, and someone had pinned Awful
    Example by the shoulders from behind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; he yelled, too blind with passion to notice the
    movements of surprise among the men before him. &ldquo;Let me go! I&rsquo;ll
    smash&mdash;any man&mdash;that&mdash;that says a word again&rsquo; a mate
    of mine behind his back. Barcoo, I&rsquo;ll have your blood! Let me go! I&rsquo;ll,
    I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll&mdash; Who&rsquo;s holdin&rsquo; me? You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Macquarie, old mate!&rdquo; said a quiet voice.</p>
  <p>Barcoo thought he heard his horse again, and went out in a hurry. Perhaps
    he thought that the horse would get impatient and break loose if he left
    it any longer, for he jumped into the saddle and rode off.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BaldyThompson"></a>Baldy Thompson</b></h2>
  <p>Rough, squarish face, curly auburn wig, bushy grey eyebrows and moustache,
    and grizzly stubble&mdash;eyes that reminded one of Dampier the actor. He
    was a squatter of the old order&mdash;new chum, swagman, drover, shearer,
    super, pioneer, cocky, squatter, and finally bank victim. He had been through
    it all, and knew all about it.</p>
  <p>He had been in parliament, and wanted to again; but the men mistrusted
    him as Thompson, M.P., though they swore by him as old Baldy Thompson the
    squatter. His hobby was politics, and his politics were badly boxed. When
    he wasn&rsquo;t cursing the banks and government he cursed the country. He
    cursed the Labour leaders at intervals, and seemed to think that he could
    run the unions better than they could. Also, he seemed to think that he could
    run parliament better than any premier. He was generally voted a hard case,
    which term is mostly used in a kindly sense out back.</p>
  <p>He was always grumbling about the country. If a shearer or rouseabout was
    good at argument, and a bit of a politician, he hadn&rsquo;t to slave much
    at Thompson&rsquo;s shed, for Baldy would argue with him all day and pay
    for it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t put on any more men,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say to travellers. &ldquo;I
    can&rsquo;t put on a lot of men to make big cheques when there&rsquo;s no
    money in the bank to pay &rsquo;em&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got all I can do
    to get tucker for the family. I shore nothing but burrs and grass-seed last
    season, and it didn&rsquo;t pay carriage. I&rsquo;m just sending away a flock
    of sheep now, and I won&rsquo;t make threepence a head on &rsquo;em. I had
    twenty thousand in the bank season before last, and now I can&rsquo;t count
    on one. I&rsquo;ll have to roll up my swag and go on the track myself next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Baldy,&rdquo; they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;git out your blooming
    swag and come along with us, old man; we&rsquo;ll stick to you and see you
    through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear I&rsquo;d show you round first,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d reply. &ldquo;Go
    up to the store and get what rations you want. You can camp in the huts to-night,
    and I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But most likely he&rsquo;d find his way over after tea, and sit on his heels
    in the cool outside the hut, and argue with the swagmen about unionism and
    politics. And he&rsquo;d argue all night if he met his match.</p>
  <p>The track by Baldy Thompson&rsquo;s was reckoned as a good tucker track,
    especially when a dissolution of parliament was threatened. Then the guileless
    traveller would casually let Baldy know that he&rsquo;d got his name on the
    electoral list, and show some interest in Baldy&rsquo;s political opinions,
    and oppose them at first, and finally agree with them and see a lot in them&mdash;be
    led round to Baldy&rsquo;s way of thinking, in fact; and ultimately depart,
    rejoicing, with a full nose-bag, and a quiet grin for his mate.</p>
  <p>There are many camp-fire yarns about old Baldy Thompson.</p>
  <p>One New Year the shearers&mdash;shearing stragglers&mdash;roused him in
    the dead of night and told him that the shed was on fire. He came out in
    his shirt and without his wig. He sacked them all there and then, but of
    course they went to work as usual next morning. There is something sad and
    pathetic about that old practical joke&mdash;as indeed there is with all
    bush jokes. There seems a quiet sort of sadness always running through outback
    humour&mdash;whether alleged or otherwise.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the usual yarn about a jackaroo mistaking Thompson for a brother
    rouser, and asking him whether old Baldy was about anywhere, and Baldy said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, are you looking for a job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, do you think I stand any show? What sort of a boss is Baldy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d tramp from here to Adelaide,&rdquo; said Baldy, &ldquo;and
    north to the Gulf country, and wouldn&rsquo;t find a worse. He&rsquo;s the
    meanest squatter in Australia. The damned old crawler! I grafted like a nigger
    for him for over fifty years&rdquo;&mdash;Baldy was over sixty&mdash;&ldquo;and
    now the old skunk won&rsquo;t even pay me the last two cheques he owes me&mdash;says
    the bank has got everything he had&mdash;that&rsquo;s an old cry of his,
    the damned old sneak; seems to expect me to go short to keep his wife and
    family and relations in comfort, and by God I&rsquo;ve done it for the last
    thirty or forty years, and I might go on the track to-morrow worse off than
    the meanest old whaler that ever humped bluey. Don&rsquo;t you have anything
    to do with Scabby Thompson, or you&rsquo;ll be sorry for it. Better tramp
    to hell than take a job from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I think I&rsquo;ll move on. Would I stand any show for some
    tucker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him! He wouldn&rsquo;t give a dog a crust, and like as not he&rsquo;d
    get you run in for trespass if he caught you camping on the run. But come
    along to the store and I&rsquo;ll give you enough tucker to carry you on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He patronized literature and arts, too, though in an awkward, furtive way.
    We remember how we once turned up at the station hard up and short of tucker,
    and how we entertained Baldy with some of his own ideas as ours&mdash;having
    been posted beforehand by our mate&mdash;and how he told us to get some rations
    and camp in the hut and see him in the morning.</p>
  <p>And we saw him in the morning, had another yarn with him, agreed and sympathized
    with him some more, were convinced on one or two questions which we had failed
    to see at first, cursed things in chorus with him, and casually mentioned
    that we expected soon to get some work on a political paper.</p>
  <p>And at last he went inside and brought out a sovereign. &ldquo;Wrap this
    in a piece of paper and put it in your pocket, and don&rsquo;t lose it,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>But we learnt afterwards that the best way to get along with Baldy, and
    secure his good will, was to disagree with him on every possible point.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ForAuldLangSyne"></a>For Auld Lang Syne</b></h2>
  <p>These were ten of us there on the wharf when our first mate left for Maoriland,
    he having been forced to leave Sydney because he could not get anything like
    regular work, nor anything like wages for the work he could get. He was a
    carpenter and joiner, a good tradesman and a rough diamond. He had got married
    and had made a hard fight for it during the last two years or so, but the
    result only petrified his conviction that &ldquo;a lovely man could get no
    blessed show in this condemned country,&rdquo;  as he expressed it; so he
    gave it best at last&mdash;&ldquo;chucked it up,&rdquo; as he said&mdash;left
    his wife with her people and four pounds ten, until such time as he could
    send for her&mdash;and left himself with his box of tools, a pair of hands
    that could use them, a steerage ticket, and thirty shillings.</p>
  <p>We turned up to see him off. There were ten of us all told and about twice
    as many shillings all counted. He was the first of the old push to go&mdash;we
    use the word push in its general sense, and we called ourselves the mountain
    push because we had worked in the tourist towns a good deal&mdash;he was
    the first of the mountain push to go; and we felt somehow, and with a vague
    kind of sadness or uneasiness, that this was the beginning of the end of
    old times and old things. We were plasterers, bricklayers, painters, a carpenter,
    a labourer, and a plumber, and were all suffering more or less&mdash;mostly
    more&mdash;and pretty equally, because of the dearth of regular graft, and
    the consequent frequency of the occasions on which we didn&rsquo;t hold it&mdash;the &ldquo;it&rdquo;  being
    the price of one or more long beers. We had worked together on jobs in the
    city and up-country, especially in the country, and had had good times together
    when things were locomotive, as Jack put it; and we always managed to worry
    along cheerfully when things were &ldquo;stationary.&rdquo; On more than
    one big job up the country our fortnightly spree was a local institution
    while it lasted, a thing that was looked forward to by all parties, whether
    immediately concerned or otherwise (and all were concerned more or less),
    a thing to be looked back to and talked over until next pay-day came. It
    was a matter for anxiety and regret to the local business people and publicans,
    and loafers and spielers, when our jobs were finished and we left.</p>
  <p>There were between us the bonds of graft, of old times, of poverty, of vagabondage
    and sin, and in spite of all the right-thinking person may think, say or
    write, there was between us that sympathy which in our times and conditions
    is the strongest and perhaps the truest of all human qualities, the sympathy
    of drink. We were drinking mates together. We were wrong-thinking persons
    too, and that was another bond of sympathy between us.</p>
  <p>There were cakes of tobacco, and books, and papers, and several flasks of &ldquo;rye-buck&rdquo;&mdash;our
    push being distantly related to a publican who wasn&rsquo;t half a bad sort&mdash;to
    cheer and comfort our departing mate on his uncertain way; and these tokens
    of mateship and the sake of auld lang syne were placed casually in his bunk
    or slipped unostentatiously into his hand or pockets, and received by him
    in short eloquent silence (sort of an aside silence), and partly as a matter
    of course. Every now and then there would be a surreptitious consultation
    between two of us and a hurried review of finances, and then one would slip
    quietly ashore and presently return supremely unconscious of a book, magazine,
    or parcel of fruit bulging out of his pocket.</p>
  <p>You may battle round with mates for many years, and share and share alike,
    good times or hard, and find the said mates true and straight through it
    all; but it is their little thoughtful attentions when you are going away,
    that go right down to the bottom of your heart, and lift it up and make you
    feel inclined&mdash;as you stand alone by the rail when the sun goes down
    on the sea&mdash;to write or recite poetry and otherwise make a fool of yourself.</p>
  <p>We helped our mate on board with his box, and inspected his bunk, and held
    a consultation over the merits or otherwise of its position, and got in his
    way and that of the under-steward and the rest of the crew right down to
    the captain, and superintended our old chum&rsquo;s general arrangements,
    and upset most of them, and interviewed various members of the crew as to
    when the boat would start for sure, and regarded their statements with suspicion,
    and calculated on our own account how long it would take to get the rest
    of the cargo aboard, and dragged our mate ashore for a final drink, and found
    that we had &ldquo;plenty of time to slip ashore for a parting wet&rdquo; so
    often that his immediate relations grew anxious and officious, and the universe
    began to look good, and kind, and happy, and bully, and jolly, and grand,
    and glorious to us, and we forgave the world everything wherein it had not
    acted straight towards us, and were filled full of love for our kind of both
    genders&mdash;for the human race at large&mdash;and with an almost irresistible
    longing to go aboard, and stay at all hazards, and sail along with our mate.
    We had just time  &ldquo;to slip ashore and have another&rdquo; when the
    gangway was withdrawn and the steamer began to cast off. Then a rush down
    the wharf, a hurried and confused shaking of hands, and our mate was snatched
    aboard. The boat had been delayed, and we had waited for three hours, and
    had seen our chum nearly every day for years, and now we found we hadn&rsquo;t
    begun to say half what we wanted to say to him. We gripped his hand in turn
    over the rail, as the green tide came between, till there was a danger of
    one mate being pulled aboard&mdash;which he wouldn&rsquo;t have minded much&mdash;or
    the other mate pulled ashore, or one or both yanked overboard. We cheered
    the captain and cheered the crew and the passengers&mdash;there was a big
    crowd of them going and a bigger crowd of enthusiastic friends on the wharf&mdash;and
    our mate on the forward hatch; we cheered the land they were going to and
    the land they had left behind, and sang &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; and &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    a Jolly Good Fellow&rdquo; (and so yelled all of us) and &ldquo;Home Rule
    for Ireland Evermore&rdquo;&mdash;which was, I don&rsquo;t know why, an old
    song of ours. And we shouted parting injunctions and exchanged old war cries,
    the meanings of which were only known to us, and we were guilty of such riotous
    conduct that, it being now Sunday morning, one or two of the quieter members
    suggested we had better drop down to about half-a-gale, as there was a severe-looking
    old sergeant of police with an eye on us; but once, in the middle of a heart-stirring
    chorus of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne,&rdquo;  Jack, my especial chum, paused for
    breath and said to me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Joe, the trap&rsquo;s joining in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so he was&mdash;and leading.</p>
  <p>But I well remember the hush that fell on that, and several other occasions,
    when the steamer had passed the point.</p>
  <p>And so our first mate sailed away out under the rising moon and under the
    morning stars. He is settled down in Maoriland now, in a house of his own,
    and has a family and a farm; but somehow, in the bottom of our hearts, we
    don&rsquo;t like to think of things like this, for they don&rsquo;t fit in
    at all with &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>There were six or seven of us on the wharf to see our next mate go. His
    ultimate destination was known to himself and us only. We had pickets at
    the shore end of the wharf, and we kept him quiet and out of sight; the send-off
    was not noisy, but the hand-grips were very tight and the sympathy deep.
    He was running away from debt, and wrong, and dishonour, a drunken wife,
    and other sorrows, and we knew it all.</p>
  <p>Two went next&mdash;to try their luck in Western Australia; they were plasterers.
    Ten of us turned up again, the push having been reinforced by one or two
    new members and an old one who had been absent on the first occasion. It
    was a glorious send-off, and only two found beds that night&mdash;the government
    supplied the beds.</p>
  <p>And one by one and two by two they have gone from the wharf since then.
    Jack went to-day; he was perhaps the most irreclaimable of us all&mdash;a
    hard case where all cases were hard; and I loved him best&mdash;anyway I
    know that, wherever Jack goes, there will be someone who will barrack for
    me to the best of his ability (which is by no means to be despised as far
    as barracking is concerned), and resent, with enthusiasm and force if he
    deems it necessary, the barest insinuation which might be made to the effect
    that I could write a bad line if I tried, or be guilty of an action which
    would not be straight according to the rules of mateship.</p>
  <p>Ah well! I am beginning to think it is time I emigrated too; I&rsquo;ll
    pull myself together and battle round and raise the price of a steerage ticket,
    and maybe a pound or two over. There may not be anybody to see me off, but
    some of the boys are sure to be on the wharf or platform &ldquo;over there,&rdquo; when
    I arrive. Lord! I almost hear them hailing now! and won&rsquo;t I yell back!
    and perhaps there won&rsquo;t be a wake over old times in some cosy bar parlour,
    or camp, in Western Australia or Maoriland some night in a year to come.</p>
