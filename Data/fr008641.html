<h2>Sanditon<br>

<hr>
<p class="letter"><i>Sanditon</i> was the last work which Jane
Austen wrote, and was unfinished at the time of her death on 18
July, 1817.<br>
<br>
"The untitled manuscript written throughout in Jane Austen's own
hand, is the working draft of a substantial and evolving work of
fiction. It totals...about 24,000 words, and perhaps one-fifth of a
completed novel...James Edward Austen-Leigh provided a précis and
quotations from the manuscript, under the title 'The Last Work', in
the second edition of his <i>Memoir of Jane Austen</i> (1871), and
R. W. Chapman published the first complete transcription under the
title <i>Fragment of a Novel</i> in 1925. Yet 'Sanditon' seems to
have been an unofficial title used within the Austen family at
least from the mid-nineteenth century. A paper facsimile edition of
the manuscript was published in 1975, with an introduction by B. C.
Southam."<br>

<h2><a name="Ch-01" id="Ch-01">Chapter 1</a></h2>
<p>A gentleman and a lady travelling from Tunbridge towards that
part of the Sussex coast which lies between Hastings and
Eastbourne, being induced by business to quit the high road and
attempt a very rough lane, were overturned in toiling up its long
ascent, half rock, half sand. The accident happened just beyond the
only gentleman's house near the lane&mdash;a house which their
driver, on being first required to take that direction, had
conceived to be necessarily their object and had with most
unwilling looks been constrained to pass by. He had grumbled and
shaken his shoulders and pitied and cut his horses so sharply that
he might have been open to the suspicion of overturning them on
purpose (especially as the carriage was not his master's own) if
the road had not indisputably become worse than before, as soon as
the premises of the said house were left behind&mdash;expressing
with a most portentous countenance that, beyond it, no wheels but
cart wheels could safely proceed. The severity of the fall was
broken by their slow pace and the narrowness of the lane; and the
gentleman having scrambled out and helped out his companion, they
neither of them at first felt more than shaken and bruised. But the
gentleman had, in the course of the extrication, sprained his
foot&mdash;and soon becoming sensible of it, was obliged in a few
moments to cut short both his remonstrances to the driver and his
congratulations to his wife and himself&mdash;and sit down on the
bank, unable to stand.</p>
<p>"There is something wrong here," said he, putting his hand to
his ankle. "But never mind, my dear&mdash;" looking up at her with
a smile, "it could not have happened, you know, in a better
place&mdash;Good out of evil. The very thing perhaps to be wished
for. We shall soon get relief. <i>There,</i> I fancy, lies my
cure&mdash;" pointing to the neat-looking end of a cottage, which
was seen romantically situated among wood on a high eminence at
some little distance&mdash;"Does not <i>that</i> promise to be the
very place?"</p>
<p>His wife fervently hoped it was; but stood, terrified and
anxious, neither able to do or suggest anything, and receiving her
first real comfort from the sight of several persons now coming to
their assistance. The accident had been discerned from a hayfield
adjoining the house they had passed. And the persons who approached
were a well-looking, hale, gentlemanlike man, of middle age, the
proprietor of the place, who happened to be among his haymakers at
the time, and three or four of the ablest of them summoned to
attend their master&mdash;to say nothing of all the rest of the
field&mdash;men, women and children, not very far off.</p>
<p>Mr. Heywood, such was the name of the said proprietor, advanced
with a very civil salutation, much concern for the accident, some
surprise at anybody's attempting that road in a carriage, and ready
offers of assistance. His courtesies were received with good
breeding and gratitude, and while one or two of the men lent their
help to the driver in getting the carriage upright again, the
traveller said, "You are extremely obliging, sir, and I take you at
your word. The injury to my leg is, I dare say, very trifling. But
it is always best in these cases, you know, to have a surgeon's
opinion without loss of time; and as the road does not seem in a
favourable state for my getting up to his house myself, I will
thank you to send off one of these good people for the
surgeon."</p>
<p>"The surgeon, sir!" exclaimed Mr. Heywood. "I am afraid you will
find no surgeon at hand here, but I dare say we shall do very well
without him."</p>
<p>"Nay sir, if <i>he</i> is not in the way, his partner will do
just as well, or rather better. I would rather see his partner.
Indeed I would prefer the attendance of his partner. One of these
good people can be with him in three minutes, I am sure. I need not
ask whether I see the house," (looking towards the cottage) "for
excepting your own, we have passed none in this place which can be
the abode of a gentleman."</p>
<p>Mr. Heywood looked very much astonished, and replied: "What,
sir! Are you expecting to find a surgeon in that cottage? We have
neither surgeon nor partner in the parish, I assure you."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir," replied the other. "I am sorry to have the
appearance of contradicting you, but from the extent of the parish
or some other cause you may not be aware of the fact. Stay. Can I
be mistaken in the place? Am I not in Willingden? Is not this
Willingden?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, this is certainly Willingden."</p>
<p>"Then, sir, I can bring proof of your having a surgeon in the
parish, whether you may know it or not. Here, sir," (taking out his
pocket book) "if you will do me the favor of casting your eye over
these advertisements which I cut out myself from the <i>Morning
Post</i> and the <i>Kentish Gazette</i>, only yesterday morning in
London, I think you will be convinced that I am not speaking at
random. You will find in it an advertisement of the dissolution of
a partnership in the medical line in your own
parish&mdash;extensive business, undeniable character respectable
references wishing to form a separate establishment. You will find
it at full length, sir,"&mdash;offering the two little oblong
extracts.</p>
<p>"Sir," said Mr. Heywood with a good humoured smile, "if you were
to show me all the newspapers that are printed in one week
throughout the kingdom, you would not persuade me of there being a
surgeon in Willingden," said Mr. Heywood with a good-humoured
smile. "Having lived here ever since I was born, man and boy
fifty-seven years, I think I must have known of such a person. At
least I may venture to say that he has not much business. To be
sure, if gentlemen were to be often attempting this lane in
post-chaises, it might not be a bad speculation for a surgeon to
get a house at the top of the hill. But as to that cottage, I can
assure you, sir, that it is in fact, in spite of its spruce air at
this distance, as indifferent a double tenement as any in the
parish, and that my shepherd lives at one end and three old women
at the other."</p>
<p>He took the pieces of paper as he spoke, and, having looked them
over, added, "I believe I can explain it, sir. Your mistake
<i>is</i> in the place. There are two Willingdens in this country.
And your advertisement refers to the other, which is Great
Willingden or Willingden Abbots, and lies seven miles off on the
other side of Battle&mdash;quite down in the Weald. And <i>we,</i>
sir," he added, speaking rather proudly, "are not in the
Weald."</p>
<p>"Not <i>down</i> in the weald, I am sure," replied the traveller
pleasantly. "It took us half an hour to climb your hill. Well, I
dare say it is as you say and I have made an abominably stupid
blunder&mdash;all done in a moment. The advertisements did not
catch my eye till the last half hour of our being in
town&mdash;when everything was in the hurry and confusion which
always attend a short stay there. One is never able to complete
anything in the way of business, you know, till the carriage is at
the door. And, accordingly satisfying myself with a brief inquiry,
and finding we were actually to pass within a mile or two of a
<i>Willingden,</i> I sought no farther...My dear," (to his wife) "I
am very sorry to have brought you into this scrape. But do not be
alarmed about my leg. It gives me no pain while I am quiet. And as
soon as these good people have succeeded in setting the carriage to
rights and turning the horses round, the best thing we can do will
be to measure back our steps into the turnpike road and proceed to
Hailsham, and so home, without attempting anything farther. Two
hours take us home from Hailsham. And once at home, we have our
remedy at hand, you know. A little of our own bracing sea air will
soon set me on my feet again. Depend upon it, my dear, it is
exactly a case for the sea. Saline air and immersion will be the
very thing. My sensations tell me so already."</p>
<p>In a most friendly manner Mr. Heywood here interposed,
entreating them not to think of proceeding till the ankle had been
examined and some refreshment taken, and very cordially pressing
them to make use of his house for both purposes.</p>
<p>"We are always well stocked," said he, "with all the common
remedies for sprains and bruises. And I will answer for the
pleasure it will give my wife and daughters to be of service to you
in every way in their power."</p>
<p>A twinge or two, in trying to move his foot, disposed the
traveller to think rather more than he had done at first of the
benefit of immediate assistance; and consulting his wife in the few
words of "Well, my dear, I believe it will be better for us," he
turned again to Mr. Heywood, and said: "Before we accept your
hospitality sir, and in order to do away with any unfavourable
impression which the sort of wild-goose chase you find me in may
have given rise to, allow me to tell you who we are. My name is
Parker, Mr. Parker of Sanditon; this lady, my wife, Mrs. Parker. We
are on our road home from London. My name perhaps, though I am by
no means the first of my family holding landed property in the
parish of Sanditon, may be unknown at this distance from the coast.
But Sanditon itself&mdash;everybody has heard of Sanditon. The
favourite for a young and rising bathing-place, certainly the
favourite spot of all that are to be found along the coast of
Sussex&mdash;the most favoured by nature, and promising to be the
most chosen by man."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have heard of Sanditon," replied Mr. Heywood. "Every
five years, one hears of some new place or other starting up by the
sea and growing the fashion. How they can half of them be filled is
the wonder! <i>Where</i> people can be found with money and time to
go to them! Bad things for a country&mdash;sure to raise the price
of provisions and make the poor good for nothing&mdash;as I dare
say you find, sir."</p>
<p>"Not at all, sir, not at all," cried Mr. Parker eagerly. "Quite
the contrary, I assure you. A common idea, but a mistaken one. It
may apply to your large, overgrown places like Brighton or Worthing
or Eastbourne but <i>not</i> to a small village like Sanditon,
precluded by its size from experiencing any of the evils of
civilization. While the growth of the place, the buildings, the
nursery grounds, the demand for everything and the sure resort of
the very best company whose regular, steady, private families of
thorough gentility and character who are a blessing everywhere,
excited the industry of the poor and diffuse comfort and
improvement among them of every sort. No sir, I assure you,
Sanditon is not a place&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do not mean to take exception to any place in particular,"
answered Mr. Heywood. "I only think our coast is too full of them
altogether. But had we not better try to get you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Our coast too full!" repeated Mr. Parker. "On that point
perhaps we may not totally disagree. At least there are
<i>enough.</i> Our coast is abundant enough. It demands no more.
Everybody's taste and everybody's finances may be suited. And those
good people who are trying to add to the number are, in my opinion,
excessively absurd and must soon find themselves the dupes of their
own fallacious calculations. Such a place as Sanditon, sir, I may
say was wanted, was called for. Nature had marked it out, had
spoken in most intelligible characters. The finest, purest sea
breeze on the coast&mdash;acknowledged to be so&mdash;excellent
bathing&mdash;fine hard sand&mdash;deep water ten yards from the
shore&mdash;no mud&mdash;no weeds&mdash;no slimy rocks. Never was
there a place more palpably designed by nature for the resort of
the invalid&mdash;the very spot which thousands seemed in need of!
The most desirable distance from London! One complete, measured
mile nearer than Eastbourne. Only conceive, sir, the advantage of
saving a whole mile in a long journey. But Brinshore, sir, which I
dare say you have in your eye&mdash;the attempts of two or three
speculating people about Brinshore this last year to raise that
paltry hamlet lying as it does between a stagnant marsh, a bleak
moor and the constant effluvia of a ridge of putrefying
seaweed&mdash;can end in nothing but their own disappointment. What
in the name of common sense is to <i>recommend</i> Brinshore? A
most insalubrious air&mdash;roads proverbially
detestable&mdash;water brackish beyond example&mdash;impossible to
get a good dish of tea within three miles of the place. And as for
the soil it is so cold and ungrateful that it can hardly be made to
yield a cabbage. Depend upon it, sir, that this is a most faithful
Brinshore&mdash;not in the smallest degree exaggerated&mdash;and if
you have heard it differently spoken of&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sir, I never heard it spoken of in my life before," said Mr.
Heywood. "I did not know there was such a place in the world."</p>
<p>"You did not! There, my dear," turning with exultation to his
wife, "you see how it is. So much for the celebrity of Brinshore!
This gentleman did not know there was such a place in the world.
Why, in truth, sir, I fancy we may apply to Brinshore that line of
the poet Cowper in his description of the religious cottager, as
opposed to Voltaire&mdash;<i>She,</i> never heard of half a mile
from home."</p>
<p>"With all my heart, sir, apply any verses you like to it. But I
want to see something applied to your leg. And I am sure by your
lady's countenance that she is quite of my opinion and thinks it a
pity to lose any more time. And here come my girls to speak for
themselves and their mother." (Two or three genteel-looking young
women, followed by as many maid servants, were now seen issuing
from the house.) "I began to wonder the bustle should not have
reached <i>them.</i> A thing of this kind soon makes a stir in a
lonely place like ours. Now, sir, let us see how you can be best
conveyed into the house."</p>
<p>The young ladies approached and said everything that was proper
to recommend their father's offers, and in an unaffected manner
calculated to make the strangers easy. And, as Mrs. Parker was
exceedingly anxious for relief, and her husband by this time not
much less disposed for it, a very few civil scruples were enough;
especially as the carriage, being now set up, was discovered to
have received such injury on the fallen side as to be unfit for
present use. Mr. Parker was therefore carried into the house and
his carriage wheeled off to a vacant barn.</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-02" id="Ch-02">Chapter 2</a></h2>
<p>The acquaintance, thus oddly begun, was neither short nor
unimportant. For a whole fortnight the travellers were fixed at
Willingden, Mr. Parker's sprain proving too serious for him to move
sooner. He had fallen into very good hands. The Heywoods were a
thoroughly respectable family and every possible attention was
paid, in the kindest and most unpretending manner, to both husband
and wife. <i>He</i> was waited on and nursed, and <i>she</i>
cheered and comforted with unremitting kindness; and as every
office of hospitality and friendliness was received as it ought, as
there was not more good will on one side than gratitude on the
other, nor any deficiency of generally pleasant manners in either,
they grew to like each other, in the course of that fortnight,
exceedingly well.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker's character and history were soon unfolded. All that
he understood of himself, he readily told, for he was very
open-hearted; and where he might be himself in the dark, his
conversation was still giving information, to such of the Heywoods
as could observe. By such he was perceived to be an enthusiast on
the subject of Sanditon, a complete enthusiast. Sanditon&mdash;the
success of Sanditon as a small, fashionable bathing place, was the
object for which he seemed to live. A very few years ago, it had
been a quiet village of no pretensions, but some natural advantages
in its position and some accidental circumstances having suggested
to himself, and the other principal landholder, the probability of
its becoming a profitable speculation, they had engaged in it, and
planned and built, and praised and puffed, and raised it to
something of young renown; and Mr. Parker could now think of very
little besides.</p>
<p>The facts which, in more direct communication, he laid before
them were that he was about five and thirty, had been
married&mdash;very happily married&mdash;seven years, and had four
sweet children at home; that he was of a respectable family and
easy, though not large, fortune; no profession&mdash;succeeding as
eldest son to the property which two or three generations had been
holding and accumulating before him&mdash;that he had two brothers
and two sisters, all single and all independent&mdash;the eldest of
the two former indeed, by collateral inheritance, quite as well
provided for as himself.</p>
<p>His object in quitting the high road to hunt for an advertising
surgeon was also plainly stated. It had not proceeded from any
intention of spraining his ankle or doing himself any other injury
for the good of such surgeon, nor (as Mr. Heywood had been apt to
suppose) from any design of entering into partnership with him. It
was merely in consequence of a wish to establish some medical man
at Sanditon, which the nature of the advertisement induced him to
expect to accomplish in Willingden. He was convinced that the
advantage of a medical man at hand would very materially promote
the rise and prosperity of the place, would in fact tend to bring a
prodigious influx&mdash;nothing else was wanting. He had
<i>strong</i> reason to believe that <i>one</i> family had been
deterred last year from trying Sanditon on that account and
probably very many more&mdash;and his own sisters, who were sad
invalids and whom he was very anxious to get to Sanditon this
summer, could hardly be expected to hazard themselves in a place
where they could not have immediate medical advice.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, Mr. Parker was evidently an amiable family man,
fond of wife, children, brothers and sisters, and generally
kind-hearted; liberal, gentlemanlike, easy to please; of a sanguine
turn of mind, with more imagination than judgement. And Mrs. Parker
was as evidently a gentle, amiable, sweet-tempered woman, the
properest wife in the world for a man of strong understanding but
not of a capacity to supply the cooler reflection which her own
husband sometimes needed; and so entirely waiting to be guided on
every occasion that whether he was risking his fortune or spraining
his ankle, she remained equally useless.</p>
<p>Sanditon was a second wife and four children to him, hardly less
dear, and certainly more engrossing. He could talk of it forever.
It had indeed the highest claims; not only those of birthplace,
property and home; it was his mine, his lottery, his speculation
and his hobby horse; his occupation, his hope and his futurity. He
was extremely desirous of drawing his good friends at Willingden
thither; and his endeavours in the cause were as grateful and
disinterested as they were warm.</p>
<p>He wanted to secure the promise of a visit, to get as many of
the family as his own house would contain, to follow him to
Sanditon as soon as possible; and, healthy as they all undeniably
were, foresaw that every one of them would be benefited by the sea.
He held it indeed as certain that no person could be really well,
no person (however upheld for the present by fortuitous aids of
exercise and spirits in a semblance of health) could be really in a
state of secure and permanent health without spending at least six
weeks by the sea every year. The sea air and sea bathing together
were nearly infallible, one or the other of them being a match for
every disorder of the stomach, the lungs or the blood. They were
anti-spasmodic, anti-pulmonary, anti-septic, anti-billious and
anti-rheumatic. Nobody could catch cold by the sea; nobody wanted
appetite by the sea; nobody wanted spirits; nobody wanted strength.
Sea air was healing, softening, relaxing fortifying and bracing
seemingly just as was wanted sometimes one, sometimes the other. If
the sea breeze failed, the sea-bath was the certain corrective; and
where bathing disagreed, the sea air alone was evidently designed
by nature for the cure.</p>
<p>His eloquence, however, could not prevail. Mr. and Mrs. Heywood
never left home. Marrying early and having a very numerous family,
their movements had long been limited to one small circle; and they
were older in habits than in age. Excepting two journeys to London
in the year to receive his dividends, Mr. Heywood went no farther
than his feet or his well-tried old horse could carry him; and Mrs.
Heywood's adventurings were only now and then to visit her
neighbours in the old coach which had been new when they married
and fresh-lined on their eldest son's coming of age ten years ago.
They had a very pretty property; enough, had their family been of
reasonable limits, to have allowed them a very gentlemanlike share
of luxuries and change; enough for them to have indulged in a new
carriage and better roads, an occasional month at Tunbridge Wells,
and symptoms of the gout and a winter at Bath. But the maintenance,
education and fitting out of fourteen children demanded a very
quiet, settled, careful course of life, and obliged them to be
stationary and healthy at Willingden.</p>
<p>What prudence had at first enjoined was now rendered pleasant by
habit. They never left home and they had gratification in saying
so. But very far from wishing their children to do the same, they
were glad to promote <i>their</i> getting out into the world as
much as possible. <i>They</i> stayed at home that their children
<i>might</i> get out; and, while making that home extremely
comfortable, welcomed every change from it which could give useful
connections or respectable acquaintance to sons or daughters. When
Mr. and Mrs. Parker, therefore, ceased from soliciting a family
visit and bounded their views to carrying back one daughter with
them, no difficulties were started. It was general pleasure and
consent.</p>
<p>Their invitation was to Miss Charlotte Heywood, a very pleasing
young woman of two and twenty, the eldest of the daughters at home
and the one who, under her mother's directions, had been
particularly useful and obliging to them; who had attended them
most and knew them best. Charlotte was to go, with excellent
health, to bathe and be better if she could; to receive every
possible pleasure which Sanditon could be made to supply by the
gratitude of those she went with; and to buy new parasols, new
gloves and new brooches for her sisters and herself at the library,
which Mr. Parker was anxiously wishing to support.</p>
<p>All that Mr. Heywood himself could be persuaded to promise was
that he would send everyone to Sanditon who asked his advice, and
that nothing should ever induce him (as far as the future could be
answered for) to spend even five shilling at Brinshore.</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-03" id="Ch-03">Chapter 3</a></h2>
<p>Every neighbourhood should have a great lady. The great lady of
Sanditon was Lady Denham; and in their journey from Willingden to
the coast, Mr. Parker gave Charlotte a more detailed account of her
than had been called for before. She had been necessarily often
mentioned at Willingden for being his colleague in speculation.
Sanditon itself could not be talked of long without the
introduction of Lady Denham. That she was a very rich old lady, who
had buried two husbands, who knew the value of money, and was very
much looked up to and had a poor cousin living with her, were facts
already known; but some further particulars of her history and her
character served to lighten the tediousness of a long hill, or a
heavy bit of road, and to give the visiting young lady a suitable
knowledge of the person with whom she might now expect to be daily
associating.</p>
<p>Lady Denham had been a rich Miss Brereton, born to wealth but
not to education. Her first husband had been a Mr. Hollis, a man of
considerable property in the country, of which a large share of the
parish of Sanditon, with manor and mansion house, made a part. He
had been an elderly man when she married him, her own age about
thirty. Her motives for such a match could be little understood at
the distance of forty years, but she had so well nursed and pleased
Mr. Hollis that at his death he left her everything&mdash;all his
estates, and all at her disposal. After a widowhood of some years,
she had been induced to marry again. The late Sir Harry Denham, of
Denham Park in the neighbourhood of Sanditon, had succeeded in
removing her and her large income to his own domains, but he could
not succeed in the views of permanently enriching his family which
were attributed to him. She had been too wary to put anything out
of her own power and when, on Sir Harry's decease, she returned
again to her own house at Sanditon, she was said to have made this
boast to a friend: "that though she had <i>got</i> nothing but her
title from the family, still she had <i>given</i> nothing for
it."</p>
<p>For the title, it was to be supposed, she had married; and Mr.
Parker acknowledged there being just such a degree of value for it
apparent now, as to give her conduct that natural explanation.
"There is at times," said he, "a little self-importance but it is
not offensive and there are moments, there are points, when her
love of money is carried greatly too far. But she is a good-natured
woman, a very good-natured woman&mdash;a very obliging, friendly
neighbour; a cheerful, independent, valuable character and her
faults may be entirely imputed to her want of education. She has
good natural sense, but quite uncultivated. She has a fine active
mind as well as a fine healthy frame for a woman of seventy, and
enters into the improvement of Sanditon with a spirit truly
admirable. Though now and then, a littleness <i>will</i> appear.
She cannot look forward quite as I would have her and takes alarm
at a trifling present expense without considering what returns it
<i>will</i> make her in a year or two. That is&mdash;awe think
<i>differently,</i> we now and then see things <i>differently,</i>
Miss Heywood. Those who tell their own story, you know, must be
listened to with caution. When you see us in contact, you will
judge for yourself."</p>
<p>Lady Denham was indeed a great lady beyond the common wants of
society, for she had many thousands a year to bequeath, and three
distinct sets of people to be courted by: her own relations, who
might very reasonably wish for her original thirty thousand pounds
among them; the legal heirs of Mr. Hollis, who must hope to be more
indebted to <i>her</i> sense of justice than he had allowed them to
be to <i>his;</i> and those members of the Denham family whom her
second husband had hoped to make a good bargain for. By all of
these, or by branches of them, she had no doubt been long, and
still continued to be, well attacked; and of these three divisions,
Mr. Parker did not hesitate to say that Mr. Hollis's kindred were
the <i>least</i> in favour and Sir Harry Denham's the <i>most.</i>
The former, he believed, had done themselves irremediable harm by
expressions of very unwise and unjustifiable resentment at the time
of Mr. Hollis's death; the latter had the advantage of being the
remnant of a connection which she certainly valued, of having been
known to her from their childhood and of being always at hand to
preserve their interest by reasonable attention. Sir Edward, the
present baronet, nephew to Sir Harry, resided constantly at Denham
Park; and Mr. Parker had little doubt that he and his sister, Miss
Denham, who lived with him, would be principally remembered in her
will. He sincerely hoped it. Miss Denham had a very small
provision; and her brother was a poor man for his rank in
society.</p>
<p>"He is a warm friend to Sanditon," said Mr. Parker, "and his
hand would be as liberal as his heart, had he the power. He would
be a noble coadjutor! As it is, he does what he can and is running
up a tasteful little cottage <i>ornèe</i>, on a strip of waste
ground Lady Denham has granted him, which I have no doubt we shall
have many a candidate for, before the end even of <i>this</i>
season."</p>
<p>Till within the last twelvemonth, Mr. Parker had considered Sir
Edward as standing without a rival, as having the fairest chance of
succeeding to the greater part of all that she had to give; but
there were now another person's claims to be taken into account,
those of the young female relation whom Lady Denham had been
induced to receive into her family. After having always protested
against any such addition, and long and often enjoyed the repeated
defeats she had given to every attempt of her relations to
introduce this young lady or that young lady as a companion at
Sanditon House, she had brought back with her from London last
Michaelmas a Miss Brereton, who bid fair by her merits to vie in
favour with Sir Edward and to secure for herself and her family
that share of the accumulated property which they had certainly the
best right to inherit.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker spoke warmly of Clara Brereton, and the interest of
his story increased very much with the introduction of such a
character. Charlotte listened with more than amusement now; it was
solicitude and enjoyment, as she heard her described to be lovely,
amiable, gentle, unassuming, conducting herself uniformly with
great good sense, and evidently gaining by her innate worth on, the
affections of her patroness. Beauty, sweetness, poverty and
dependence do not want the imagination of a man to operate upon;
with due exceptions, woman feels for woman very promptly and
compassionately. He gave the particulars which had led to Clara's
admission at Sanditon as no bad exemplification of that mixture of
character, that union of littleness with kindness with good sense
with even liberality which he saw in Lady Denham.</p>
<p>After having avoided London for many years, principally on
account of these very cousins who were continually writing,
inviting and tormenting her, and whom she was determined to keep at
a distance, she had been obliged to go there last Michaelmas with
the certainty of being detained at least a fortnight. She had gone
to a hotel, living by her own account as prudently as possible to
defy the reputed expensiveness of such a home, and at the end of
three days calling for her bill that she might judge of her state.
Its amount was such as determined her on staying not another hour
in the house, and she was preparing in all the anger and
perturbation of her belief in very gross imposition <i>there</i>,
and her ignorance of where to go for better usage, to leave the
hotel at all hazards, when the cousins, the politic and lucky
cousins, who seemed always to have a spy on her, introduced
themselves at this important moment, and learning her situation,
persuaded her to accept such a home for the rest of her stay as
their humbler house in a very inferior part of London could
offer.</p>
<p>She went; was delighted with her welcome and the hospitality and
attention she received from everybody&mdash;found her good cousins
the Breretons beyond her expectation worthy people&mdash;and
finally was impelled by a personal knowledge of their narrow income
and pecuniary difficulties to invite one of the girls of the family
to pass the winter with her. The invitation was to <i>one</i>, for
six months&mdash;with the probability of another being then to take
her place&mdash;but in <i>selecting</i> the one, Lady Denham had
shown the good part of her character. For, passing by the actual
<i>daughters</i> of the house, she had chosen Clara, a
niece&mdash;more helpless and more pitiable of course than
any&mdash;a dependent on poverty&mdash;an additional burden on an
encumbered circle&mdash;and one who had been so low in every
worldly view as, with all her natural endowments and powers, to
have been preparing for a situation little better than a nursery
maid.</p>
<p>Clara had returned with her&mdash;and by her good sense and
merit had now, to all appearance, secured a very strong hold in
Lady Denham's regard. The six months had long been over&mdash;and
not a syllable was breathed of any change or exchange. She was a
general favourite. The influence of her steady conduct and mild,
gentle temper was felt by everybody. The prejudices which had met
her at first, in some quarters, were all dissipated. She was felt
to be worthy of trust, to be the very companion who would guide and
soften Lady Denham, who would enlarge her mind and open her hand.
She was as thoroughly amiable as she was lovely&mdash;and since
having had the advantage of their Sanditon breezes, that loveliness
was complete.</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-04" id="Ch-04">Chapter 4</a></h2>
<p>"And whose very snug-looking place is this?" said Charlotte as,
in a sheltered dip within two miles of the sea, they passed close
by a moderate-sized house, well fenced and planted, and rich in the
garden, orchard and meadows which are the best embellishments of
such a dwelling. "It seems to have as many comforts about it as
Willingden."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Mr. Parker. "This is my old house, the house of my
forefathers, the house where I and all my brothers and sisters were
born and bred, and where my own three eldest children were born;
where Mrs. Parker and I lived till within the last two years, till
our new house was finished. I am glad you are pleased with it. It
is an honest old place; and Hillier keeps it in very good order. I
have given it up, you know, to the man who occupies the chief of my
land. He gets a better house by it, and I, a rather better
situation! One other hill brings us to Sanditon&mdash;modern
Sanditon&mdash;a beautiful spot. Our ancestors, you know, always
built in a hole. Here were we, pent down in this little contracted
nook, without air or view, only one mile and three quarters from
the noblest expanse of ocean between the South Foreland and Land's
End, and without the smallest advantage from it. You will not think
I have made a bad exchange when we reach Trafalgar
House&mdash;which by the bye, I almost wish I had not named
Trafalgar&mdash;for Waterloo is more the thing now. However,
Waterloo is in reserve; and if we have encouragement enough this
year for a little crescent to be ventured on, as I trust we shall,
then we shall be able to call it Waterloo Crescent&mdash;and the
name joined to the form of the building, which always takes, will
give us the command of lodgers. In a good season we should have
more applications than we could attend to."</p>
<p>"It was always a very comfortable house," said Mrs. Parker,
looking at it through the back window with something like the
fondness of regret. "And such a nice garden such an excellent
garden."</p>
<p>"Yes, my love, but <i>that</i> we may be said to carry with us.
<i>It</i> supplies us, as before, with all the fruit and vegetables
we want. And we have, in fact, all the comfort of an excellent
kitchen garden without the constant eyesore of its formalities or
the yearly nuisance of its decaying vegetation. Who can endure a
cabbage bed in October?"</p>
<p>"Oh dear, yes. We are quite as well off for garden stuff as ever
we were; for if it is forgot to be brought at any time, we can
always buy what we want at Sanditon House. The gardener there is
glad enough to supply us. But it was a nice place for the children
to run about in. So shady in summer!"</p>
<p>"My dear, we shall have shade enough on the hill, and more than
enough in the course of a very few years. The growth of my
plantations is a general astonishment. In the meanwhile we have the
canvas awning which gives us the most complete comfort within
doors. And you can get a parasol at Whitby's for little Mary at any
time, or a large bonnet at Jebb's. And as for the boys, I must say
I would rather <i>them</i> run about in the sunshine than not. I am
sure we agree, my dear, in wishing our boys to be as hardy as
possible."</p>
<p>"Yes indeed, I am sure we do. And I will get Mary a little
parasol, which will make her as proud as can be. How grave she will
walk about with it and fancy herself quite a little woman. Oh, I
have not the smallest doubt of our being a great deal better off
where we are now. If we any of us want to bathe, we have not a
quarter of a mile to go. But you know," (still looking back), "one
loves to look at an old friend at a place where one has been happy.
The Hilliers did not seem to feel the storms last winter at all. I
remember seeing Mrs. Hillier after one of those dreadful nights,
when <i>we</i> had been literally rocked in our bed, and she did
not seem at all aware of the wind being anything more than
common."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, that's likely enough. <i>We</i> have all the grandeur
of the storm with less real danger because the wind, meeting with
nothing to oppose or confine it around our house, simply rages and
passes on; while down in this gutter, nothing is known of the state
of the air below the tops of the trees; and the inhabitants may be
taken totally unawares by one of those dreadful currents, which do
more mischief in a valley when they <i>do</i> arise than an open
country ever experiences in the heaviest gale. But, my dear love,
as to gardenstuff, you were saying that any accidental omission is
supplied in a moment by Lady Denham's gardener. But it occurs to me
that we ought to go elsewhere upon such occasions, and that old
Stringer and his son have a higher claim. I encouraged him to set
up, you know, and am afraid he does not do very well. That is,
there has not been time enough yet. He <i>will</i> do very well
beyond a doubt. But at first it is uphill work, and therefore we
must give him what help we can. When any vegetables or fruit happen
to be wanted&mdash;and it will not be amiss to have them often
wanted, to have something or other forgotten most days&mdash;just
to have a nominal supply, you know, that poor old Andrew may not
lose his daily job&mdash;but in fact to buy the chief of our
consumption from the Stringers."</p>
<p>"Very well, my love, that can be easily done. And cook will be
satisfied, which will be a great comfort, for she is always
complaining of old Andrew now and says he never brings her what she
wants. There now the old house is quite left behind. What is it
your brother Sidney says about its being a hospital?"</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Mary, merely a joke of his. He pretends to advise
me to make a hospital of it. He pretends to laugh at my
improvements. Sidney says anything, you know. He has always said
what he chose, of and to us all. Most families have such a member
among them, I believe, Miss Heywood. There is someone in most
families privileged by superior abilities or spirits to say
anything. In ours, it is Sidney, who is a very clever young man and
with great powers of pleasing. He lives too much in the world to be
settled; that is his only fault. He is here and there and
everywhere. I wish we may get him to Sanditon. I should like to
have you acquainted with him. And it would be a fine thing for the
place! Such a young man as Sidney, with his neat equipage and
fashionable air. You and I, Mary, know what effect it might have.
Many a respectable family, many a careful mother, many a pretty
daughter might it secure us to the prejudice of Eastbourne and
Hastings."</p>
<p>They were now approaching the church and the real village of
Sanditon, which stood at the foot of the hill they were afterwards
to ascend&mdash;a hill whose side was covered with the woods and
enclosures of Sanditon House and whose height ended in an open down
where the new buildings might soon be looked for. A branch only, of
the valley, winding more obliquely towards the sea, gave a passage
to an inconsiderable stream, and formed at its mouth a third
habitable division in a small cluster of fishermen's houses.</p>
<p>The original village contained little more than cottages; but
the spirit of the day had been caught, as Mr. Parker observed with
delight to Charlotte, and two or three of the best of them were
smartened up with a white curtain and "Lodgings to let," and
farther on, in the little green court of an old farm house, two
females in elegant white were actually to be seen with their books
and camp stools; and in turning the corner of the baker's shop, the
sound of a harp might be heard through the upper casement.</p>
<p>Such sights and sounds were highly blissful to Mr. Parker. Not
that he had any personal concern in the success of the village
itself; for considering it as too remote from the beach, he had
done nothing there; but it was a most valuable proof of the
increasing fashion of the place altogether. If the <i>village</i>
could attract, the hill might be nearly full. He anticipated an
amazing season. At the same time last year (late in July) there had
not been a single lodger in the village! Nor did he remember any
during the whole summer, excepting one family of children who came
from London for sea air after the whooping cough, and whose mother
would not let them be nearer the shore for fear of their tumbling
in.</p>
<p>"Civilization, civilization indeed!" cried Mr. Parker,
delighted. "Look, my dear Mary, look at William Heeley's windows.
Blue shoes, and nankin boots! Who would have expected such a sight
at a shoemaker's in old Sanditon! This is new within the month.
There was no blue shoe when we passed this way a month ago.
Glorious indeed! Well, I think I <i>have</i> done something in my
day. Now, for our hill, our health-breathing hill."</p>
<p>In ascending, they passed the lodge gates of Sanditon House and
saw the top of the house itself among its groves. It was the last
building of former days in that line of the parish. A little higher
up, the modern began; and in crossing the down, a Prospect House, a
Bellevue Cottage and a Denham Place were to be looked at by
Charlotte with the calmness of amused curiosity, and by Mr. Parker
with the eager eye which hoped to see scarcely any empty houses.
More bills at the windows than he had calculated on&mdash;and a
smaller show of company on the hill&mdash;fewer carriages, fewer
walkers. He had fancied it just the time of day for them to be all
returning from their airings to dinner; but the sands and the
Terrace always attracted some&mdash;and the tide must be flowing
about half-tide now.</p>
<p>He longed to be on the sands, the cliffs, at his own house, and
everywhere out of his house at once. His spirits rose with the very
sight of the sea and he could almost feel his ankle getting
stronger already. Trafalgar House, on the most elevated spot on the
down, was a light, elegant building, standing in a small lawn with
a very young plantation round it, about a hundred yards from the
brow of a steep but not very lofty cliff&mdash;and the nearest to
it of every building, excepting one short row of smart-looking
houses called the Terrace, with a broad walk in front, aspiring to
be the Mall of the place. In this row were the best milliner's shop
and the library&mdash;a little detached from it, the hotel and
billiard room. Here began the descent to the beach and to the
bathing machines. And this was therefore the favourite spot for
beauty and fashion.</p>
<p>At Trafalgar House, rising at a little distance behind the
Terrace, the travellers were safely set down; and all was happiness
and joy between Papa and Mama and their children; while Charlotte,
having received possession of her apartment, found amusement enough
in standing at her ample Venetian window and looking over the
miscellaneous foreground of unfinished buildings, waving linen and
tops of houses, to the sea, dancing and sparkling in sunshine and
freshness.</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-05" id="Ch-05">Chapter 5</a></h2>
<p>When they met before dinner, Mr. Parker was looking over
letters.</p>
<p>"Not a line from Sidney!" said he. "He is an idle fellow. I sent
him an account of my accident from Willingden and thought he would
have vouchsafed me an answer. But perhaps it implies that he is
coming himself. I trust it may. But here is a letter from one of my
sisters. <i>They</i> never fail me. Women are the only
correspondents to be depended on. Now, Mary," smiling at his wife,
"before I open it, what shall we guess as to the state of health of
those it comes from or rather what would Sidney say if he were
here? Sidney is a saucy fellow, Miss Heywood. And you must know, he
will have it there is a good deal of imagination in my two sisters'
complaints. But it really is not so, or very little. They have
wretched health, as you have heard us say frequently, and are
subject to a variety of very serious disorders. Indeed, I do not
believe they know what a day's health is. And at the same time,
they are such excellent useful women and have so much energy of
character that where any good is to be done, they force themselves
on exertions which, to those who do not thoroughly know them, have
an extraordinary appearance. But there is really no affectation
about them, you know. They have only weaker constitutions and
stronger minds than are often met with, either separate or
together. And our youngest brother, who lives with them and who is
not much above twenty, I am sorry to say is almost as great an
invalid as themselves. He is so delicate that he can engage in no
profession. Sidney laughs at him. But it really is no joke, though
Sidney often makes me laugh at them all in spite of myself. Now, if
he were here, I know he would be offering odds that either Susan,
Diana or Arthur would appear by this letter to have been at the
point of death within the last month."</p>
<p>Having run his eye over the letter, he shook his head and began:
"No chance of seeing them at Sanditon I am sorry to say. A very
indifferent account of them indeed. Seriously, a very indifferent
account. Mary, you will be quite sorry to hear how ill they have
been and are. Miss Heywood, if you will give me leave, I will read
Diana's letter aloud. I like to have my friends acquainted with
each other and I am afraid this is the only sort of acquaintance I
shall have the means of accomplishing between you. And I can have
no scruple on Diana's account; for her letters show her exactly as
she is, the most active, friendly, warm-hearted being in existence,
and therefore must give a good impression."</p>
<p>He read: "My dear Tom, we were all much grieved at your
accident, and if you had not described yourself as fallen into such
very good hands, I should have been with you at all hazards the day
after the receipt of your letter, though it found me suffering
under a more severe attack than usual of my old grievance,
spasmodic bile, and hardly able to crawl from my bed to the sofa.
But how were you treated? Send me more Particulars in your next. If
indeed a simple sprain, as you denominate it, nothing would have
been so judicious as friction, friction by the hand alone,
supposing it could be applied <i>instantly</i>. Two years ago I
happened to be calling on Mrs. Sheldon when her coachman sprained
his foot as he was cleaning the carriage and could hardly limp into
the house, but by the immediate use of friction alone steadily
persevered in (and I rubbed his ankle with my own hand for six
hours without intermission) he was well in three days. Many thanks,
my dear Tom, for the kindness with respect to us, which had so
large a share in bringing on your accident. But pray never run into
peril again in looking for an apothecary on our account, for had
you the most experienced man in his line settled at Sanditon, it
would be no recommendation to us. We have entirely done with the
whole medical tribe. We have consulted physician after physician in
vain, till we are quite convinced that they can do nothing for us
and that we must trust to our own knowledge of our own wretched
constitutions for any relief. But if you think it advisable for the
interest of the <i>place</i>, to get a medical man there, I will
undertake the commission with pleasure, and have no doubt of
succeeding. I could soon put the necessary irons in the fire. As
for getting to Sanditon myself, it is quite an impossibility. I
grieve to say that I dare not attempt it, but my feelings tell me
too plainly that, in my present state, the sea air would probably
be the death of me. And neither of my dear companions will leave me
or I would promote their going down to you for a fortnight. But in
truth, I doubt whether Susan's nerves would be equal to the effort.
She has been suffering much from the headache, and six leeches a
day for ten days together relieved her so little that we thought it
right to change our measures, and being convinced on examination
that much of the evil lay in her gum, I persuaded her to attack the
disorder there. She has accordingly had three teeth drawn, and is
decidedly better, but her nerves are a good deal deranged. She can
only speak in a whisper and fainted away twice this morning on poor
Arthur's trying to suppress a cough. He, I am happy to say, is
tolerably well though more languid than I like and I fear for his
liver. I have heard nothing of Sidney since your being together in
town, but conclude his scheme to the Isle of Wight has not taken
place or we should have seen him in his way. Most sincerely do we
wish you a good season at Sanditon, and though we cannot contribute
to your Beau Monde in person, we are doing our utmost to send you
company worth having and think we may safely reckon on securing you
two large families, one a rich West Indian from Surrey, the other a
most respectable Girls Boarding School, or Academy, from
Camberwell. I will not tell you how many people I have employed in
the business&mdash;Wheel within wheel&mdash;but success more than
repays. Yours most affectionately."</p>
<p>"Well," said Mr. Parker, as he finished. "Though I dare say
Sidney might find something extremely entertaining in this letter
and make us laugh for half an hour together, I declare <i>I</i>, by
myself, can see nothing in it but what is either very pitiable or
very creditable. With all their sufferings, you perceive how much
they are occupied in promoting the good of others! So anxious for
Sanditon! Two large families one for Prospect House probably, the
other for Number two Denham place or the end house of the Terrace,
with extra beds at the hotel. I told you my sister were excellent
women, Miss Heywood."</p>
<p>"And I am sure they must be very extraordinary ones," said
Charlotte. "I am astonished at the cheerful style of the letter,
considering the state in which both sisters appear to be. Three
teeth drawn at once&mdash;frightful! Your sister Diana seems almost
as ill as possible, but those three teeth of your sister Susan's
are more distressing than all the rest."</p>
<p>"Oh, they are so used to the operation&mdash;to every
operation&mdash;and have such fortitude!"</p>
<p>"Your sisters know what they are about, I dare say, but their
measures seem to touch on extremes. I feel that in any illness
<i>I</i> should be so anxious for professional advice, so very
little venturesome for myself or anybody I loved! But then,
<i>we</i> have been so healthy a family that I can be no judge of
what the habit of self-doctoring may do."</p>
<p>"Why to own the truth," said Mrs. Parker, "I do think the Miss
Parkers carry it too far sometimes. And so do you, my love, you
know. You often think they would be better if they would leave
themselves more alone and especially Arthur. I know you think it a
great pity they should give <i>him</i> such a turn for being
ill."</p>
<p>"Well, well, my dear Mary, I grant you, it <i>is</i> unfortunate
for poor Arthur that at his time of life he should be encouraged to
give way to indisposition. It <i>is</i> bad that he should be
fancying himself too sickly for any profession and sit down at one
and twenty, on the interest of his own little fortune, without any
idea of attempting to improve it or of engaging in any occupation
that may be of use to himself or others. But let us talk of
pleasanter things. These two large families are just what we
wanted. But here is something at hand pleasanter still&mdash;Morgan
with his 'Dinner on table.'"</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-06" id="Ch-06">Chapter 6</a></h2>
<p>The party were very soon moving after dinner. Mr. Parker could
not be satisfied without an early visit to the library and the
library subscription book; and Charlotte was glad to see as much
and as quickly as possible where all was new. They were out in the
very quietest part of a watering-place day, when the important
business of dinner or of sitting after dinner was going on in
almost every inhabited lodging. Here and there might be seen a
solitary elderly man, who was forced to move early and walk for
health; but in general, it was a thorough pause of company, it was
emptiness and tranquillity on the Terrace, the cliffs and the
sands.</p>
<p>The shops were deserted. The straw hats and pendant lace seemed
left to their fate both within the house and without, and Mrs.
Whitby at the library was sitting in her inner room, reading one of
her own novels for want of employment. The list of subscribers was
but commonplace. The Lady Denham, Miss Brereton, Mr. and Mrs.
Parker, Sir Edward Denham and Miss Denham, whose names might be
said to lead off the season, were followed by nothing better than:
Mrs. Mathews, Miss Mathews, Miss E. Mathews, Miss H. Mathews; Dr.
and Mrs. Brown; Mr. Richard Pratt; Lieutenant Smith R.N.; Captain
Little Limehouse; Mrs. Jane Fisher, Miss Fisher, Miss Scroggs;
Reverend Mr. Hanking; Mr. Beard, Solicitor, Grays Inn; Mrs. Davis
and Miss Merryweather.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker could not but feel that the list was not only without
distinction but less numerous than he had hoped. It was but July,
however, and August and September were the months. And besides, the
promised large families from Surrey and Camberwell were an
ever-ready consolation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Whitby came forward without delay from her literary recess,
delighted to see Mr. Parker, whose manners recommended him to
everybody, and they were fully occupied in their various civilities
and communications, while Charlotte, having added her name to the
list as the first offering to the success of the season, was busy
in some immediate purchases for the further good of everybody, as
soon as Miss Whitby could be hurried down from her toilette, with
all her glossy curls and smart trinkets, to wait on her.</p>
<p>The library, of course, afforded everything: all the useless
things in the world that could not be done without; and among so
many pretty temptations, and with so much good will for Mr. Parker
to encourage expenditure, Charlotte began to feel that she must
check herself&mdash;or rather she reflected that at two and twenty
there could be no excuse for her doing otherwise&mdash;and that it
would not do for her to be spending all her money the very first
evening. She took up a book; it happened to be a volume of
<i>Camilla.</i> She had not <i>Camilla's</i> youth, and had no
intention of having her distress; so, she turned from the drawers
of rings and brooches, repressed further solicitation and paid for
what she had bought.</p>
<p>For her particular gratification, they were then to take a turn
on the cliff; but as they quitted the library they were met by two
ladies whose arrival made an alteration necessary: Lady Denham and
Miss Brereton. They had been to Trafalgar House and been directed
thence to the library; and though Lady Denham was a great deal too
active to regard the walk of a mile as anything requiring rest, and
talked of going home again directly, the Parkers knew that to be
pressed into their house and obliged to take her tea with them
would suit her best; and therefore the stroll on the cliff gave way
to an immediate return home.</p>
<p>"No, no," said her Ladyship. "I will not have you hurry your tea
on my account. I know you like your tea late. My early hours are
not to put my neighbours to inconvenience. No, no, Miss Clara and I
will get back to our own tea. We came out with no other thought. We
wanted just to see you and make sure of your being really come, but
we get back to our own tea."</p>
<p>She went on however towards Trafalgar House and took possession
of the drawing room very quietly without seeming to hear a word of
Mrs. Parker's orders to the servant, as they entered, to bring tea
directly. Charlotte was fully consoled for the loss of her walk by
finding herself in company with those whom the conversation of the
morning had given her a great curiosity to see. She observed them
well. Lady Denham was of middle height, stout, upright and alert in
her motions, with a shrewd eye and self-satisfied air but not an
unagreeable countenance; and though her manner was rather downright
and abrupt, as of a person who valued herself on being free-spoken,
there was a good humour and cordiality about her&mdash;a civility
and readiness to be acquainted with Charlotte herself, and a
heartiness of welcome towards her old friends, which was inspiring
the good will, she seemed to feel. And as for Miss Brereton, her
appearance so completely justified Mr. Parker's praise that
Charlotte thought she had never beheld a more lovely or more
interesting young woman.</p>
<p>Elegantly tall, regularly handsome, with great delicacy of
complexion and soft blue eyes, a sweetly modest and yet naturally
graceful address, Charlotte could see in her only the most perfect
representation of whatever heroine might be most beautiful and
bewitching in all the numerous volumes they had left behind on Mrs.
Whitby's shelves. Perhaps it might be partly owing to her having
just issued from a circulating library but she could not separate
the idea of a complete heroine from Clara Brereton. Her situation
with Lady Denham so very much in favour of it! She seemed placed
with her on purpose to be ill-used. Such poverty and dependence
joined to such beauty and merit seemed to leave no choice in the
business.</p>
<p>These feelings were not the result of any spirit of romance in
Charlotte herself. No, she was a very sober-minded young lady,
sufficiently well-read in novels to supply her imagination with
amusement, but not at all unreasonably influenced by them; and
while she pleased herself the first five minutes with fancying the
persecution which <i>ought</i> to be the lot of the interesting
Clara, especially in the form of the most barbarous conduct on Lady
Denham's side, she found no reluctance to admit from subsequent
observation that they appeared to be on very comfortable terms. She
could see nothing worse in Lady Denham than the sort of
old-fashioned formality of always calling her <i>Miss Clara;</i>
nor anything objectionable in the degree of observance and
attention which Clara paid. On one side it seemed protecting
kindness, on the other grateful and affectionate respect.</p>
<p>The conversation turned entirely upon Sanditon, its present
number of visitants and the chances of a good season. It was
evident that Lady Denham had more anxiety, more fears of loss, than
her coadjutor. She wanted to have the place fill faster and seemed
to have many harassing apprehensions of the lodgings being in some
instances underlet. Miss Diana Parker's two large families were not
forgotten.</p>
<p>"Very good, very good," said her Ladyship. "A West Indy family
and a school. That sounds well. That will bring money."</p>
<p>"No people spend more freely, I believe, than West Indians,"
observed Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>"Aye, so I have heard; and because they have full purses fancy
themselves equal, may be, to your old country families. But then,
they who scatter their money so freely never think of whether they
may not be doing mischief by raising the price of things. And I
have heard that's very much the case with your West-injines. And if
they come among us to raise the price of our necessaries of life,
we shall not much thank them, Mr. Parker."</p>
<p>"My dear Madam, they can only raise the price of consumable
articles by such an extraordinary demand for them and such a
diffusion of money among us as must do us more good than harm. Our
butchers and bakers and traders in general cannot get rich without
bringing prosperity to <i>us.</i> If <i>they</i> do not gain, our
rents must be insecure; and in proportion to their profit must be
ours eventually in the increased value of our houses."</p>
<p>"Oh! well. But I should not like to have butcher's meat raised,
though. And I shall keep it down as long as I can. Aye, that young
lady smiles, I see. I dare say she thinks me an odd sort of
creature; but <i>she</i> will come to care about such matters
herself in time. Yes, yes, my dear, depend upon it, you will be
thinking of the price of butcher's meat in time, though you may not
happen to have quite such a servants' hall to feed as I have. And I
do believe those are best off that have fewest servants. I am not a
woman of parade as all the world knows, and if it was not for what
I owe to poor Mr. Hollis's memory, I should never keep up Sanditon
House as I do. It is not for my own pleasure. Well, Mr. Parker, and
the other is a boarding school, a French boarding school, is it? No
harm in that. They'll stay their six weeks. And out of such a
number, who knows but some may be consumptive and want asses' milk;
and I have two milch asses at this present time. But perhaps the
little Misses may hurt the furniture. I hope they will have a good
sharp governess to look after them."</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Parker got no more credit from Lady Denham than he had
from his sisters for the object which had taken him to
Willingden.</p>
<p>"Lord! my dear sir," she cried. "How could you think of such a
thing? I am very sorry you met with your accident, but upon my
word, you deserved it. Going after a doctor! Why, what should we do
with a doctor here? It would be only encouraging our servants and
the poor to fancy themselves ill if there was a doctor at hand. Oh!
pray, let us have none of the tribe at Sanditon. We go on very well
as we are. There is the sea and the downs and my milch asses. And I
have told Mrs. Whitby that if anybody inquires for a chamber-horse,
they may be supplied at a fair rate&mdash;poor Mr. Hollis's
chamber-horse as good as new&mdash;and what can people want for
more? Here have I lived seventy good years in the world and never
took physic above twice and never saw the face of a doctor in all
my life on my <i>own</i> account. And I verily believe if my poor
dear Sir Harry had never seen one neither, he would have been alive
now. Ten fees, one after another, did the man take who sent
<i>him</i> out of the world. I beseech you Mr. Parker, no doctors
here."</p>
<p>The tea things were brought in.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Mrs. Parker&mdash;you should not indeed&mdash;why
would you do so? I was just upon the point of wishing you good
evening. But since you are so very neighbourly, I believe Miss
Clara and I must stay."</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-07" id="Ch-07">Chapter 7</a></h2>
<p>The popularity of the Parkers brought them some visitors the
very next morning; amongst them, Sir Edward Denham and his sister
who, having been at Sanditon House, drove on to pay their
compliments; and the duty of letter writing being accomplished,
Charlotte was settled with Mrs. Parker in the drawing room in time
to see them all. The Denhams were the only ones to excite
particular attention. Charlotte was glad to complete her knowledge
of the family by an introduction to them; and found them, the
better half at least&mdash;for while single, the <i>gentleman</i>
may sometimes be thought the better half of the pair&mdash;not
unworthy of notice. Miss Denham was a fine young woman, but cold
and reserved, giving the idea of one who felt her consequence with
pride and her poverty with discontent, and who was immediately
gnawed by the want of a handsomer equipage than the simple gig in
which they travelled, and which their groom was leading about still
in her sight. Sir Edward was much her superior in air and
manner&mdash;certainly handsome, but yet more to be remarked for
his very good address and wish of paying attention and giving
pleasure. He came into the room remarkably well, talked
much&mdash;and very much to Charlotte, by whom he chanced to be
placed&mdash;and she soon perceived that he had a fine countenance,
a most pleasing gentleness of voice and a great deal of
conversation. She liked him. Sober-minded as she was, she thought
him agreeable and did not quarrel with the suspicion of his finding
her equally so, which <i>would</i> arise from his evidently
disregarding his sister's motion to go, and persisting in his
station and his discourse. I make no apologies for my heroine's
vanity. If there are young ladies in the world at her time of life
more dull of fancy and more careless of pleasing, I know them not
and never wish to know them.</p>
<p>At last, from the low French windows of the drawing room which
commanded the road and all the paths across the down, Charlotte and
Sir Edward as they sat could not but observe Lady Denham and Miss
Brereton walking by&mdash;and there was instantly a slight change
in Sir Edward's countenance&mdash;with an anxious glance after them
as they proceeded&mdash;followed by an early proposal to his
sister&mdash;not merely for moving, but for walking on together to
the Terrace&mdash;which altogether gave a hasty turn to Charlotte's
fancy, cured her of her half-hour's fever, and placed her in a more
capable state of judging, when Sir Edward was gone, of <i>how</i>
agreeable he had actually been. "Perhaps there was a good deal in
his air and address; and his title did him no harm."</p>
<p>She was very soon in his company again. The first object of the
Parkers, when their house was cleared of morning visitors, was to
get out themselves. The Terrace was the attraction to all.
Everybody who walked must begin with the Terrace; and there, seated
on one of the two green benches by the gravel walk, they found the
united Denham party; but though united in the gross, very
distinctly divided again&mdash;the two superior ladies being at one
end of the bench, and Sir Edward and Miss Brereton at the other.
Charlotte's first glance told her that Sir Edward's air was that of
a lover. There could be no doubt of his devotion to Clara. How
Clara received it was less obvious, but she was inclined to think
not very favourably; for though sitting thus apart with him (which
probably she might not have been able to prevent) her air was calm
and grave.</p>
<p>That the young lady at the other end of the bench was doing
penance was indubitable. The difference in Miss Denham's
countenance, the change from Miss Denham sitting in cold grandeur
in Mrs. Parker's drawing room, to be kept from silence by the
efforts of others, to Miss Denham at Lady Denham's elbow, listening
and talking with smiling attention or solicitous eagerness, was
very striking&mdash;and very amusing&mdash;or very melancholy, just
as satire or morality might prevail. Miss Denham's character was
pretty well decided with Charlotte. Sir Edward's required longer
observation. He surprised her by quitting Clara immediately on
their all joining and agreeing to walk, and by addressing his
attentions entirely to herself.</p>
<p>Stationing himself close by her, he seemed to mean to detach her
as much as possible from the rest of the party and to give her the
whole of his conversation. He began, in a tone of great taste and
feeling, to talk of the sea and the sea shore; and ran with energy
through all the usual phrases employed in praise of their sublimity
and descriptive of the <i>undescribable</i> emotions they excite in
the mind of sensibility. The terrific grandeur of the ocean in a
storm, its glass surface in a calm, its gulls and its samphire and
the deep fathoms of its abysses, its quick vicissitudes, its
direful deceptions, its mariners tempting it in sunshine and
overwhelmed by the sudden tempest, all were eagerly and fluently
touched&mdash;rather commonplace perhaps, but doing very well from
the lips of a handsome Sir Edward&mdash;and she could not but think
him a man of feeling&mdash;till he began to stagger her by the
number of his quotations and the bewilderment of some of his
sentences.</p>
<p>"Do you remember," said he, "Scott's beautiful lines on the sea?
Oh! what a description they convey! They are never out of my
thoughts when I walk here. That man who can read them unmoved must
have the nerves of an assassin! Heaven defend me from meeting such
a man unarmed."</p>
<p>"What description do you mean?" said Charlotte. "I remember none
at this moment, of the sea, in either of Scott's poems."</p>
<p>"Do you not indeed? Nor can I exactly recall the beginning at
this moment. But you cannot have forgotten his description of
woman&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">'Oh! Woman in our hours of ease&mdash;'</p>
<p>"Delicious! Delicious! Had he written nothing more, he would
have been immortal. And then again, that unequalled, unrivalled
address to parental affection&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">'Some feelings are to mortals given<br>
With less of earth in them than heaven' etc.</p>
<p>"But while we are on the subject of poetry, what think you, Miss
Heywood, of Burns's lines to his Mary? Oh! there is pathos to
madden one! If ever there was a man who <i>felt,</i> it was Burns.
Montgomery has all the fire of poetry, Wordsworth has the true soul
of it, Campbell in his pleasures of hope has touched the extreme of
our sensations&mdash;'Like angel's visits, few and far between.'
Can you conceive anything more subduing, more melting, more fraught
with the deep sublime than that line? But Burns&mdash;I confess my
sense of his pre-eminence, Miss Heywood. If Scott <i>has</i> a
fault, it is the want of passion. Tender, elegant, descriptive but
<i>tame.</i> The man who cannot do justice to the attributes of
woman is my contempt. Sometimes indeed a flash of feeling seems to
irradiate him, as in the lines we were speaking of&mdash;'Oh. Woman
in our hours of ease'&mdash;. But Burns is always on fire. His soul
was the altar in which lovely woman sat enshrined, his spirit truly
breathed the immortal incense which is her due."</p>
<p>"I have read several of Burns's poems with great delight," said
Charlotte as soon as she had time to speak. "But I am not poetic
enough to separate a man's poetry entirely from his character; and
poor Burns's known irregularities greatly interrupt my enjoyment of
his lines. I have difficulty in depending on the <i>truth</i> of
his feelings as a lover. I have not faith in the <i>sincerity</i>
of the affections of a man of his description. He felt and he wrote
and he forgot."</p>
<p>"Oh! no, no," exclaimed Sir Edward in an ecstasy. "He was all
ardour and truth! His genius and his susceptibilities might lead
him into some aberrations but who is perfect? It were
hyper-criticism, it were pseudo-philosophy to expect from the soul
of high-toned genius the grovellings of a common mind. The
coruscations of talent, elicited by impassioned feeling in the
breast of man, are perhaps incompatible with some of the prosaic
decencies of life; nor can you, loveliest Miss Heywood," speaking
with an air of deep sentiment, "nor can any woman be a fair judge
of what a man may be propelled to say, write or do by the sovereign
impulses of illimitable ardour."</p>
<p>This was very fine, but if Charlotte understood it at all, not
very moral; and being moreover by no means pleased with his
extraordinary style of compliment, she gravely answered, "I really
know nothing of the matter. This is a charming day. The wind, I
fancy, must be southerly."</p>
<p>"Happy, happy wind, to engage Miss Heywood's thoughts!"</p>
<p>She began to think him downright silly. His choosing to walk
with her, she had learnt to understand. It was done to pique Miss
Brereton. She had read it, in an anxious glance or two on his side;
but why he should talk so much nonsense, unless he could do no
better, was unintelligible. He seemed very sentimental, very full
of some feeling or other, and very much addicted to all the
newest-fashioned hard words, had not a very clear brain, she
presumed, and talked a good deal by rote. The future might explain
him further. But when there was a proposition for going into the
library, she felt that she had had quite enough of Sir Edward for
one morning and very gladly accepted Lady Denham's invitation of
remaining on the Terrace with her.</p>
<p>The others all left them, Sir Edward with looks of very gallant
despair in tearing himself away, and they united their
agreeableness&mdash;that is, Lady Denham, like a true great lady,
talked and talked only of her own concerns, and Charlotte listened,
amused in considering the contrast between her two companions.
Certainly there was no strain of doubtful sentiment nor any phrase
of difficult interpretation in Lady Denham's discourse. Taking hold
of Charlotte's arm with the ease of one who felt that any notice
from her was an honour, and communicative from the influence of the
same conscious importance or a natural love of talking, she
immediately said in a tone of great satisfaction and with a look of
arch sagacity, "Miss Esther wants me to invite her and her brother
to spend a week with me at Sanditon House, as I did last summer.
But I shan't. She has been trying to get round me every way with
her praise of this and her praise of that; but I saw what she was
about. I saw through it all. I am not very easily taken in, my
dear."</p>
<p>Charlotte could think of nothing more harmless to be said than
the simple enquiry of "Sir Edward and Miss Denham?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear. <i>My young folks,</i> as I call them sometimes,
for I take them very much by the hand. I had them with me last
summer, about this time, for a week; from Monday to Monday; and
very delighted and thankful they were. For they are very good young
people, my dear. I would not have you think that I <i>only</i>
notice them for poor dear Sir Harry's sake. No, no; they are very
deserving themselves or, trust me, they would not be so much in my
company. I am not the woman to help anybody blindfold. I always
take care to know what I am about and who I have to deal with
before I stir a finger. I do not think I was ever over-reached in
my life. And that is a good deal for a woman to say that has been
married twice. Poor dear Sir Harry, between ourselves, thought at
first to have got more. But, with a bit of a sigh, he is gone, and
we must not find fault with the dead. Nobody could live happier
together than us and he was a very honourable man, quite the
gentleman of ancient family. And when he died, I gave Sir Edward
his gold watch."</p>
<p>She said this with a look at her companion which implied its
right to produce a great impression; and seeing no rapturous
astonishment in Charlotte's countenance, added quickly, "He did not
bequeath it to his nephew, my dear. It was no bequest. It was not
in the will. He only told me, and <i>that</i> but once, that he
should wish his nephew to have his watch; but it need not have been
binding if I had not chose it."</p>
<p>"Very kind indeed! Very handsome!" said Charlotte, absolutely
forced to affect admiration.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear, and it is not the <i>only</i> kind thing I have
done by him. I have been a very liberal friend to Sir Edward. And
poor young man, he needs it bad enough. For though I am <i>only</i>
the <i>dowager,</i> my dear, and he is the <i>heir,</i> things do
not stand between us in the way they commonly do between those two
parties. Not a shilling do I receive from the Denham estate. Sir
Edward has no payments to make <i>me.</i> He don't stand uppermost,
believe me. It is <i>I</i> that help <i>him.</i>"</p>
<p>"Indeed! He is a very fine young man, particularly elegant in
his address."</p>
<p>This was said chiefly for the sake of saying something, but
Charlotte directly saw that it was laying her open to suspicion by
Lady Denham's giving a shrewd glance at her and replying, "Yes,
yes, he is very well to look at. And it is to be hoped that some
lady of large fortune will think so, for Sir Edward <i>must</i>
marry for money. He and I often talk that matter over. A handsome
young fellow like him will go smirking and smiling about and paying
girls compliments, but he knows he <i>must</i> marry for money. And
Sir Edward is a very steady young man in the main and has got very
good notions.</p>
<p>"Sir Edward Denham," said Charlotte, "with such personal
advantages may be almost sure of getting a woman of fortune, if he
chooses it."</p>
<p>This glorious sentiment seemed quite to remove suspicion.</p>
<p>"Aye my dear, that's very sensibly said," cried Lady Denham.
"And if we could but get a young heiress to Sanditon! But heiresses
are monstrous scarce! I do not think we have had an heiress here or
even a co-heiress since Sanditon has been a public place. Families
come after families but, as far as I can learn, it is not one in a
hundred of them that have any real property, landed or funded. An
income perhaps, but no property. Clergymen maybe, or lawyers from
town, or half-pay officers, or widows with only a jointure. And
what good can such people do anybody?&mdash;except just as they
take our empty houses and, between ourselves, I think they are
great fools for not staying at home. Now if we could get a young
heiress to be sent here for her health and if she was ordered to
drink asses' milk I could supply her and, as soon as she got well,
have her fall in love with Sir Edward!"</p>
<p>"That would be very fortunate indeed."</p>
<p>"And Miss Esther must marry somebody of fortune too. She must
get a rich husband. Ah, young ladies that have no money are very
much to be pitied! But," after a short pause, "if Miss Esther
thinks to talk me into inviting them to come and stay at Sanditon
House, she will find herself mistaken. Matters are altered with me
since last summer, you know. I have Miss Clara with me now which
makes a great difference."</p>
<p>She spoke this so seriously that Charlotte instantly saw in it
the evidence of real penetration and prepared for some fuller
remarks; but it was followed only by, "I have no fancy for having
my house as full as an hotel. I should not choose to have my two
housemaids' time taken up all the morning in dusting out bed-rooms.
They have Miss Clara's room to put to rights as well as my own
every day. If they had hard places, they would want higher
wages."</p>
<p>For objections of this nature, Charlotte was not prepared. She
found it so impossible even to affect sympathy that she could say
nothing. Lady Denham soon added, with great glee, "And besides all
this, my dear, am I to be filling my house to the prejudice of
Sanditon? If people want to be by the sea, why don't they take
lodgings? Here are a great many empty houses&mdash;three on this
very Terrace&mdash;no fewer than three lodging papers staring me in
the face at this very moment, Numbers three, four and eight. Eight,
the corner house, may be too large for them, but either of the two
others are nice little snug houses, very fit for a young gentleman
and his sister. And so, my dear, the next time Miss Esther begins
talking about the dampness of Denham park and the good bathing
always does her, I shall advise them to come and take one of these
lodgings for a fortnight. Don't you think that will be very fair?
Charity begins at home, you know."</p>
<p>Charlotte's feelings were divided between amusement and
indignation&mdash;but indignation had the larger and the increasing
share. She kept her countenance and she kept a civil silence. She
could not carry her forbearance farther; but without attempting to
listen longer, and only conscious that Lady Denham was still
talking on in the same way, allowed her thoughts to form themselves
into such a meditation as this:</p>
<p>"She is thoroughly mean. I had not expected anything so bad. Mr.
Parker spoke too mildly of her. His judgement is evidently not to
be trusted. His own good nature misleads him. He is too
kind-hearted to see clearly. I must judge for myself. And their
very <i>connection</i> prejudices him. He has persuaded her to
engage in the same speculation, and because their object in that
line is the same, he fancies she feels like him in others. But she
is very, very mean. I can see no good in her. Poor Miss Brereton!
And she makes everybody mean about her. This poor Sir Edward and
his sister&mdash;how far nature meant them to be respectable I
cannot tell&mdash;but they are <i>obliged</i> to be mean in their
servility to her. And I am mean, too, in giving her my attention
with the appearance of coinciding with her. Thus it is, when rich
people are sordid."</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-08" id="Ch-08">Chapter 8</a></h2>
<p>The two ladies continued walking together till rejoined by the
others, who, as they issued from the library, were followed by a
young Whitby running off with five volumes under his arm to Sir
Edward's gig; and Sir Edward, approaching Charlotte, said, "You may
perceive what has been our occupation. My sister wanted my counsel
in the selection of some books. We have many leisure hours and read
a great deal. I am no indiscriminate novel reader. The mere trash
of the common circulating library I hold in the highest contempt.
You will never hear me advocating those puerile emanations which
detail nothing but discordant principles incapable of amalgamation,
or those vapid tissues of ordinary occurrences, from which no
useful deductions can be drawn. In vain may we put them into a
literary alembic; we distil nothing which can add to science. You
understand me, I am sure?"</p>
<p>"I am not quite certain that I do. But if you will describe the
sort of novels which you <i>do</i> approve, I dare say it will give
me a clearer idea."</p>
<p>"Most willingly, fair questioner. The novels which I approve are
such as display human nature with grandeur; such as show her in the
sublimities of intense feeling; such as exhibit the progress of
strong passion from the first germ of incipient susceptibility to
the utmost energies of reason half-dethroned&mdash;where we see the
strong spark of woman's captivations elicit such fire in the soul
of man as leads him&mdash;though at the risk of some
aberration&mdash;from the strict line of primitive obligations to
hazard all, dare all, achieve all to obtain her. Such are the works
which I peruse with delight and, I hope I may say, with
amelioration. They hold forth the most splendid portraitures of
high conceptions, unbounded views, illimitable ardour, indomitable
decision. And even when the event is mainly anti-prosperous to the
high-toned machinations of the prime character, the potent,
pervading hero of the story, it leaves us full of generous emotions
for him; our hearts are paralysed. T'were pseudo-philosophy to
assert that we do not feel more enwrapped by the brilliancy of his
career than by the tranquil and morbid virtues of any opposing
character. Our approbation of the latter is but eleemosynary. These
are the novels which enlarge the primitive capabilities of the
heart; and which it cannot impugn the sense or be any dereliction
of the character of the most anti-puerile man, to be conversant
with."</p>
<p>"If I understand you aright," said Charlotte, "our taste in
novels is not at all the same."</p>
<p>And here they were obliged to part, Miss Denham being much too
tired of them all to stay any longer.</p>
<p>The truth was that Sir Edward, whom circumstances had confined
very much to one spot, had read more sentimental novels than agreed
with him. His fancy had been early caught by all the impassioned
and most exceptionable parts of Richardson's, and such authors as
had since appeared to tread in Richardson's steps, so far as man's
determined pursuit of woman in defiance of every opposition of
feeling and convenience was concerned, had since occupied the
greater part of his literary hours, and formed his character. With
a perversity of judgement which must be attributed to his not
having by nature a very strong head, the graces, the spirit, the
sagacity and the perseverance of the villain of the story
out-weighed all his absurdities and all his atrocities with Sir
Edward. With him such conduct was genius, fire and feeling. It
interested and inflamed him. And he was always more anxious for its
success, and mourned over its discomfitures with more tenderness,
than could ever have been contemplated by the authors.</p>
<p>Though he owed many of his ideas to this sort of reading, it
would be unjust to say that he read nothing else or that his
language was not formed on a more general knowledge of modern
literature. He read all the essays, letters, tours and criticisms
of the day; and with the same ill-luck which made him derive only
false principles from lessons of morality, and incentives to vice
from the history of its overthrow, he gathered only hard words and
involved sentences from the style of our most approved writers.</p>
<p>Sir Edward's great object in life was to be seductive. With such
personal advantages as he knew himself to possess, and such talents
as he did also give himself credit for, he regarded it as his duty.
He felt that he was formed to be a dangerous man, quite in the line
of the Lovelaces. The very name of Sir Edward, he thought, carried
some degree of fascination with it. To be generally gallant and
assiduous about the fair, to make fine speeches to every pretty
girl, was but the inferior part of the character he had to play.
Miss Heywood, or any other young woman with any pretensions to
beauty, he was entitled (according to his own view of society) to
approach with high compliment and rhapsody on the slightest
acquaintance. But it was Clara alone on whom he had serious
designs; it was Clara whom he meant to seduce.</p>
<p>Her seduction was quite determined on. Her situation in every
way called for it. She was his rival in Lady Denham's favour; she
was young, lovely and dependent. He had very early seen the
necessity of the case, and had now been long trying with cautious
assiduity to make an impression on her heart and to undermine her
principles. Clara saw through him and had not the least intention
of being seduced; but she bore with him patiently enough to confirm
the sort of attachment which her personal charms had raised. A
greater degree of discouragement indeed would not have affected Sir
Edward. He was armed against the highest pitch of disdain or
aversion. If she could not be won by affection, he must carry her
off. He knew his business. Already had he had many musings on the
subject. If he <i>were</i> constrained so to act, he must naturally
wish to strike out something new, to exceed those who had gone
before him; and he felt a strong curiosity to ascertain whether the
neighbourhood of Timbuctoo might not afford some solitary house
adapted for Clara's reception. But the expense, alas! of measures
in that masterly style was ill-suited to his purse; and prudence
obliged him to prefer the quietest sort of ruin and disgrace for
the object of his affections to the more renowned.</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-09" id="Ch-09">Chapter 9</a></h2>
<p>One day, soon after Charlotte's arrival at Sanditon, she had the
pleasure of seeing, just as she ascended from the sands to the
Terrace, a gentleman's carriage with post horses standing at the
door of the hotel, as very lately arrived and by the quantity of
luggage being taken off, bringing, it might be hoped, some
respectable family determined on a long residence.</p>
<p>Delighted to have such good news for Mr. and Mrs. Parker, who
had both gone home some time before, she proceeded to Trafalgar
House with as much alacrity as could remain after having contended
for the last two hours with a very fine wind blowing directly on
shore. But she had not reached the little lawn when she saw a lady
walking nimbly behind her at no great distance; and convinced that
it could be no acquaintance of her own, she resolved to hurry on
and get into the house if possible before her. But the stranger's
pace did not allow this to be accomplished. Charlotte was on the
steps and had rung, but the door was not opened, when the other
crossed the lawn&mdash;and when the servant appeared, they were
just equally ready for entering the house.</p>
<p>The ease of the lady, her "How do you do, Morgan?" and Morgan's
looks on seeing her, were a moment's astonishment; but another
moment brought Mr. Parker into the hall to welcome the sister he
had seen from the drawing room; and Charlotte was soon introduced
to Miss Diana Parker. There was a great deal of surprise but still
more pleasure in seeing her. Nothing could be kinder than her
reception from both husband and wife. How did she come? And with
whom? And they were so glad to find her equal to the journey! And
that she was to belong to <i>them</i> was taken as a thing of
course.</p>
<p>Miss Diana Parker was about four and thirty, of middling height
and slender; delicate looking rather than sickly; with an agreeable
face and a very animated eye; her manners resembling her brother's
in their ease and frankness, though with more decision and less
mildness in her tone. She began an account of herself without
delay. Thanking them for their invitation but "<i>that</i> was
quite out of the question for, they were all three come and meant
to get into lodgings and make some stay."</p>
<p>"All three come! What! Susan and Arthur! Susan able to come too!
This is better and better."</p>
<p>"Yes, we are actually all come. Quite unavoidable. Nothing else
to be done. You shall hear all about it. But my dear Mary, send for
the children, I long to see them."</p>
<p>"And how has Susan born the journey? And how is Arthur? And why
do we not see him here with you?"</p>
<p>"Susan has born it wonderfully. She had not a wink of sleep
either the night before we set out or last night at Chichester, and
as this is not so common with her as with <i>me</i>, I have had a
thousand fears for her. But she has kept up wonderfully&mdash;no
hysterics of consequence till we came within sight of poor old
Sanditon and the attack was not very violent&mdash;nearly over by
the time we reached your hotel so that we got her out of the
carriage extremely well, with only Mr. Woodcock's assistance. And
when I left her she was directing the disposal of the luggage and
helping old Sam uncord the trunks. She desired her best love with a
thousand regrets at being so poor a creature that she could not
come with me. And as for poor Arthur, he would not have been
unwilling himself, but there is so much wind that I did not think
he could safely venture for I am <i>sure</i> there is lumbago
hanging about him; and so I helped him on with his great coat and
sent him off to the Terrace to take us lodgings. Miss Heywood must
have seen our carriage standing at the hotel. I knew Miss Heywood
the moment I saw her before me on the down. My dear Tom, I am so
glad to see you walk so well. Let me feel your ankle. That's right;
all right and clean. The play of your sinews a <i>very</i> little
affected, barely perceptible. Well, now for the explanation of my
being here. I told you in my letter of the two considerable
families I was hoping to secure for you, the West Indians and the
seminary."</p>
<p>Here Mr. Parker drew his chair still nearer to his sister and
took her hand again most affectionately as he answered, "Yes, yes,
how active and how kind you have been!"</p>
<p>"The West Indians," she continued, "whom I look upon as the
<i>most</i> desirable of the two, as the best of the good, prove to
be a Mrs. Griffiths and her family. I know them only through
others. You must have heard me mention Miss Capper, the particular
friend of <i>my</i> very particular friend Fanny Noyce. Now, Miss
Capper is extremely intimate with a Mrs. Darling, who is on terms
of constant correspondence with Mrs. Griffiths herself. Only a
<i>short</i> chain, you see, between us, and not a link wanting.
Mrs. Griffiths meant to go to the sea for her young people's
benefit, had fixed on the coast of Sussex, but was undecided as to
the where, wanted something private, and wrote to ask the opinion
of her friend, Mrs. Darling. Miss Capper happened to be staying
with Mrs. Darling when Mrs. Griffiths' letter arrived and was
consulted on the question. <i>She</i> wrote the same day to Fanny
Noyce and mentioned it to her; and Fanny, all alive for <i>us</i>,
instantly took up her pen and forwarded the circumstance to me,
except as to <i>names</i>&mdash;which have but lately transpired.
There was but <i>one</i> thing for <i>me</i> to do. I answered
Fanny's letter by the same post and pressed for the recommendation
of Sanditon. Fanny had feared your having no house large enough to
receive such a family. But I seem to be spinning out my story to an
endless length. You see how it was all managed. I had the pleasure
of hearing soon afterwards, by the same simple link of connection,
that Sanditon <i>had been</i> recommended by Mrs. Darling, and that
the West Indians were very much disposed to go thither. This was
the state of the case when I wrote to you. But two days
ago&mdash;yes, the day before yesterday&mdash;I heard again from
Fanny Noyce, saying that <i>she</i> had heard from Miss Capper, who
by a letter from Mrs. Darling understood that Mrs. Griffiths had
expressed herself in a letter to Mrs. Darling more doubtingly on
the subject of Sanditon. Am I clear? I would be anything rather
than not clear."</p>
<p>"Oh, perfectly, perfectly. Well?"</p>
<p>"The reason of this hesitation was her having no connections in
the place, and no means of ascertaining that she should have good
accommodations on arriving there; and she was particularly careful
and scrupulous on all those matters, more on account of a certain
Miss Lambe, a young lady&mdash;probably a niece&mdash;under her
care, than on her own account, or her daughters'. Miss Lambe has an
immense fortune, richer than all the rest, and very delicate
health. One sees clearly enough by all this the <i>sort</i> of
woman Mrs. Griffiths must be: as helpless and indolent as wealth
and a hot climate are apt to make us. But we are not born to equal
energy. What was to be done? I had a few moments' indecision,
whether to offer to write to you, or to Mrs. Whitby, to secure them
a house; but neither pleased me. I hate to employ others when I am
equal to act myself; and my conscience told me that this was an
occasion which called for me. Here was a family of helpless
invalids whom I might essentially serve. I sounded Susan. The same
thought had occurred to her. Arthur made no difficulties. Our plan
was arranged immediately, we were off yesterday morning at six,
left Chichester at the same hour today, and here we are."</p>
<p>"Excellent! Excellent!" cried Mr. Parker. "Diana, you are
unequalled in serving your friends and doing good to all the world.
I know nobody like you. Mary, my love, is not she a wonderful
creature? Well, and now, what house do you design to engage for
them? What is the size of their family?"</p>
<p>"I do not at all know," replied his sister, "have not the least
idea, never heard any particulars; but I am very sure that the
largest house at Sanditon cannot be <i>too</i> large. They are more
likely to want a second. I shall take only one, however, and that
but for a week certain. Miss Heywood, I astonish you. You hardly
know what to make of me. I see by your looks that you are not used
to such quick measures."</p>
<p>The words "Unaccountable officiousness!&mdash;Activity run mad!"
had just passed through Charlotte's mind, but a civil answer was
easy.</p>
<p>"I dare say I do look surprised," said she, "because these are
very great exertions, and I know what invalids both you and your
sister are.</p>
<p>"Invalids indeed. I trust there are not three people in England
who have so sad a right to that appellation! But my dear Miss
Heywood, we are sent into this world to be as extensively useful as
possible, and where some degree of strength of mind is given, it is
not a feeble body which will excuse us or incline us to excuse
ourselves. The world is pretty much divided between the weak of
mind and the strong; between those who can act and those who
cannot; and it is the bounden duty of the capable to let no
opportunity of being useful escape them. My sister's complaints and
mine are happily not often of a nature to threaten existence
<i>immediately</i>. And as long as we <i>can</i> exert ourselves to
be of use to others, I am convinced that the body is the better for
the refreshment the mind receives in doing its duty. While I have
been travelling with this object in view, I have been perfectly
well."</p>
<p>The entrance of the children ended this little panegyric on her
own disposition; and after having noticed and caressed them all,
she prepared to go.</p>
<p>"Cannot you dine with us? Is not it possible to prevail on you
to dine with us?" was then the cry. And that being absolutely
negatived, it was, "And when shall we see you again? And how can we
be of use to you?" And Mr. Parker warmly offered his assistance in
taking the house for Mrs. Griffiths.</p>
<p>"I will come to you the moment I have dined," said he, "and we
will go about together."</p>
<p>But this was immediately declined.</p>
<p>"No, my dear Tom, upon no account in the world shall you stir a
step on any business of mine. Your ankle wants rest. I see by the
position of your foot that you have used it too much already. No, I
shall go about my house-taking directly. Our dinner is not ordered
till six; and by that time I hope to have completed it. It is now
only half past four. As to seeing <i>me</i> again today, I cannot
answer for it. The others will be at the hotel all the evening and
delighted to see you at any time; but as soon as I get back I shall
hear what Arthur has done about our own lodgings, and probably the
moment dinner is over shall be out again on business relative to
them, for we hope to get into some lodgings or other and be settled
after breakfast tomorrow. I have not much confidence in poor
Arthur's skill for lodging-taking, but he seemed to like the
commission."</p>
<p>"I think you are doing too much," said Mr. Parker. "You will
knock yourself up. You should not move again after dinner."</p>
<p>"No, indeed you should not," cried his wife, "for dinner is such
a mere <i>name</i> with you all that it can do you no good. I know
what your appetites are."</p>
<p>"My appetite is very much mended, I assure you, lately. I have
been taking some bitters of my own decocting, which have done
wonders. Susan never eats, I grant you; and just at present I shall
want nothing. I never eat for about a week after a journey. But as
for Arthur, he is only too much disposed for food. We are often
obliged to check him."</p>
<p>"But you have not told me anything of the <i>other</i> family
coming to Sanditon," said Mr. Parker as he walked with her to the
door of the house. "The Camberwell Seminary. Have we a good chance
of <i>them?"</i></p>
<p>"Oh, certain. Quite certain. I had forgotten them for the
moment. But I had a letter three days ago from my friend Mrs.
Charles Dupuis, which assured me of Camberwell. Camberwell will be
here to a certainty, and very soon. <i>That</i> good woman&mdash;I
do not know her name&mdash;not being so wealthy and independent as
Mrs. Griffiths, can travel and choose for herself. I will tell you
how I got at <i>her</i>. Mrs. Charles Dupuis lives almost next door
to a lady, who has a relation lately settled at Clapham, who
actually attends the seminary and gives lessons on eloquence and
Belles Lettres to some of the girls. I got this man a hare from one
of Sidney's friends; and he recommended Sanditon. Without <i>my</i>
appearing however, Mrs. Charles Dupuis managed it all."</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-10" id="Ch-10">Chapter 10</a></h2>
<p>It was not a week since Miss Diana Parker had been told by her
feelings, that the sea air would probably, in her present state, be
the death of her; and now she was at Sanditon, intending to make
some stay and without appearing to have the slightest recollection
of having written or felt any such thing. It was impossible for
Charlotte not to suspect a good deal of fancy in such an
extraordinary state of health. Disorders and recoveries so very
much out of the common way seemed more like the amusement of eager
minds in want of employment, than of actual afflictions and relief.
The Parkers were, no doubt, a family of imagination and quick
feelings, and while the eldest brother found vent for his
superfluity of sensation as a projector, the sisters were perhaps
driven to dissipate theirs in the invention of odd complaints.</p>
<p>The <i>whole</i> of their mental vivacity was evidently not so
employed; part was laid out in a zeal for being useful. It would
seem that they must either be very busy for the good of others or
else extremely ill themselves. Some natural delicacy of
constitution in fact, with an unfortunate turn for medicine,
especially quack medicine, had given them an early tendency at
various times, to various disorders; the rest of their sufferings
was from fancy, the love of distinction and the love of the
wonderful. They had charitable hearts and many amiable feelings;
but a spirit of restless activity, and the glory of doing more than
anybody else, had their share in every exertion of benevolence; and
there was vanity in all they did, as well as in all they
endured.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Parker spent a great part of the evening at the
hotel; but Charlotte had only two or three views of Miss Diana
posting over the down after a house for this lady whom she had
never seen, and who had never employed her. She was not made
acquainted with the others till the following day, when, being
removed into lodgings and all the party continuing quite well,
their brother and sister and herself were entreated to drink tea
with them.</p>
<p>They were in one of the Terrace houses; and she found them
arranged for the evening in a small neat drawing room, with a
beautiful view of the sea if they had chosen it; but though it had
been a very fair English summer day, not only was there no open
window, but the sofa and the table, and the establishment in
general was all at the other end of the room by a brisk fire. Miss
Parker, whom, remembering the three teeth drawn in one day,
Charlotte approached with a peculiar degree of respectful
compassion, was not very unlike her sister in person or manner,
though more thin and worn by illness and medicine, more relaxed in
air and more subdued in voice. She talked, however, the whole
evening as incessantly as Diana; and excepting that she sat with
salts in her hand, took drops two or three times from one out of
several phials already at home on the mantelpiece, and made a great
many odd faces and contortions, Charlotte could perceive no
symptoms of illness which she, in the boldness of her own good
health, would not have undertaken to cure by putting out the fire,
opening the window and disposing of the drops and the salts by
means of one or the other. She had had considerable curiosity to
see Mr. Arthur Parker; and having fancied him a very puny,
delicate-looking young man, materially the smallest of a not very
robust family, was astonished to find him quite as tall as his
brother, and a great deal stouter, broad made and lusty, and with
no other look of an invalid than a sodden complexion.</p>
<p>Diana was evidently the chief of the family, principal mover and
actor. She had been on her feet the whole morning, on Mrs.
Griffiths' business or their own, and was still the most alert of
the three. Susan had only superintended their final removal from
the hotel, bringing two heavy boxes herself, and Arthur had found
the air so cold that he had merely walked from one house to the
other as nimbly as he could, and boasted much of sitting by the
fire till he had cooked up a very good one. Diana, whose exercise
had been too domestic to admit of calculation but who, by her own
account, had not once sat down during the space of seven hours,
confessed herself a little tired. She had been too successful,
however, for much fatigue; for not only had she, by walking and
talking down a thousand difficulties, at last secured a proper
house at eight guineas per week for Mrs. Griffiths; she had also
opened so many treaties with cooks, housemaids, washerwomen and
bathing women, that Mrs. Griffiths would have little more to do on
her arrival than to wave her hand and collect them around her for
choice. Her concluding effort in the cause, had been a few polite
lines of information to Mrs. Griffiths herself, time not allowing
for the circuitous train of intelligence which had been hitherto
kept up; and she was now regaling in the delight of opening the
first trenches of an acquaintance with such a powerful discharge of
unexpected obligation.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Parker and Charlotte had seen two post chaises
crossing the down to the hotel as they were setting off, a joyful
sight and full of speculation. The Miss Parkers and Arthur had also
seen something; they could distinguish from their window that there
<i>was</i> an arrival at the hotel, but not its amount. Their
visitors answered for two hack chaises. Could it be the Camberwell
Seminary? No, no. Had there been a third carriage, perhaps it
might; but it was very generally agreed that two hack chaises could
never contain a seminary. Mr. Parker was confident of another new
family.</p>
<p>When they were all finally seated, after some removals to look
at the sea and the hotel, Charlotte's place was by Arthur, who was
sitting next to the fire with a degree of enjoyment which gave a
good deal of merit to his civility in wishing her to take his
chair. There was nothing dubious in her manner of declining it and
he sat down again with much satisfaction. She drew back her chair
to have all the advantage of his person as a screen, and was very
thankful for every inch of back and shoulders beyond her
preconceived idea. Arthur was heavy in eye as well as figure, but
by no means indisposed to talk; and while the other four were
chiefly engaged together, he evidently felt it no penance to have a
fine young woman next to him, requiring in common politeness some
attention&mdash;as his brother, who felt the decided want of some
motive for action, some powerful object of animation for him,
observed with considerable pleasure.</p>
<p>Such was the influence of youth and bloom that he began even to
make a sort of apology for having a fire. "We should not have had
one at home," said he, "but the sea air is always damp. I am not
afraid of anything so much as damp."</p>
<p>"I am so fortunate," said Charlotte, "as never to know whether
the air is damp or dry. It has always some property that is
wholesome and invigorating to me."</p>
<p>"I like the air too, as well as anybody can," replied Arthur. "I
am very fond of standing at an open window when there is no wind.
But, unluckily, a damp air does not like <i>me</i>. It gives me the
rheumatism. You are not rheumatic, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>"That's a great blessing. But perhaps you are nervous?"</p>
<p>"No, I believe not. I have no idea that I am."</p>
<p>"I am very nervous. To say the truth, nerves are the worst part
of my complaints in <i>my</i> opinion. My sisters think me bilious,
but I doubt it."</p>
<p>"You are quite in the right to doubt it as long as you possibly
can, I am sure."</p>
<p>"If I were bilious," he continued, "you know, wine would
disagree with me, but it always does me good. The more wine I drink
in moderation the better I am. I am always best of an evening. If
you had seen me today before dinner, you would have thought me a
very poor creature."</p>
<p>Charlotte could believe it. She kept her countenance, however,
and said, "As far as I can understand what nervous complaints are,
I have a great idea of the efficacy of air and exercise for
them&mdash;daily, regular exercise&mdash;and I should recommend
rather more of it to <i>you</i> than I suspect you are in the habit
of taking."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am very fond of exercise myself," he replied, "and I mean
to walk a great deal while I am here, if the weather is temperate.
I shall be out every morning before breakfast and take several
turns upon the Terrace, and you will often see me at Trafalgar
House."</p>
<p>"But you do not call a walk to Trafalgar House much
exercise?"</p>
<p>"Not as to mere distance, but the hill is so steep! Walking up
that hill, in the middle of the day, would throw me into such a
perspiration! You would see me all in a bath by the time I got
there! I am very subject to perspiration, and there cannot be a
surer sign of nervousness."</p>
<p>They were now advancing so deep in physics, that Charlotte
viewed the entrance of the servant with the tea things as a very
fortunate interruption. It produced a great and immediate change.
The young man's attentions were instantly lost. He took his own
cocoa from the tray, which seemed provided with almost as many
teapots as there were persons in company, Miss Parker drinking one
sort of herb tea, and Miss Diana another and turning completely to
the fire, sat coddling and cooking it to his own satisfaction and
toasting some slices of bread, brought up ready-prepared in the
toast rack&mdash;and till it was all done, she heard nothing of his
voice but the murmuring of a few broken sentences of
self-approbation and success.</p>
<p>When his toils were over, however, he moved back his chair into
as gallant a line as ever, and proved that he had not been working
only for himself by his earnest invitation to her to take both
cocoa and toast. She was already helped to tea, which surprised
him, so totally self-engrossed had he been.</p>
<p>"I thought I should have been in time," said he, "but cocoa
takes a great deal of boiling."</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to you," replied Charlotte. "But I
<i>prefer</i> tea."</p>
<p>"Then I will help myself," said he. "A large dish of rather weak
cocoa every evening agrees with me better than anything."</p>
<p>It struck her, however, as he poured out this rather weak cocoa,
that it came forth in a very fine, dark-coloured stream; and at the
same moment, his sisters both crying out, "Oh, Arthur, you get your
cocoa stronger and stronger every evening," with Arthur's somewhat
conscious reply of <i>'Tis</i> rather stronger than it should be
tonight,"&mdash;convinced her that Arthur was by no means so fond
of being starved as they could desire, or as he felt proper
himself. He was certainly very happy to turn the conversation on
dry toast and hear no more of his sisters.</p>
<p>"I hope you will eat some of this toast," said he. "I reckon
myself a very good toaster. I never burn my toasts, I never put
them too near the fire at first. And yet, you see, there is not a
corner but what is well browned. I hope you like dry toast.</p>
<p>"With a reasonable quantity of butter spread over it, very
much," said Charlotte, "but not otherwise.</p>
<p>"No more do I," said he, exceedingly pleased. "We think quite
alike there. So far from dry toast being wholesome, I think it a
very bad thing for the stomach. Without a little butter to soften
it, it hurts the coats of the stomach. I am sure it does. I will
have the pleasure of spreading some for you directly, and
afterwards I will spread some for myself. Very bad indeed for the
coats of the stomach, but there is no convincing <i>some</i>
people. It irritates and acts like a nutmeg grater."</p>
<p>He could not get command of the butter, however, without a
struggle; his sisters accusing him of eating a great deal too much
and declaring he was not to be trusted, and he maintaining that he
only ate enough to secure the coats of his stomach, and besides, he
only wanted it now for Miss Heywood.</p>
<p>Such a plea must prevail. He got the butter and spread away for
her with an accuracy of judgement which at least delighted himself.
But when her toast was done and he took his own in hand, Charlotte
could hardly contain herself as she saw him watching his sisters
while he scrupulously scraped off almost as much butter as he put
on, and then seizing an odd moment for adding a great dab just
before it went into his mouth. Certainly, Mr. Arthur Parker's
enjoyments in invalidism were very different from his
sisters&mdash;by no means so spiritualised. A good deal of earthy
dross hung about him. Charlotte could not but suspect him of
adopting that line of life principally for the indulgence of an
indolent temper, and to be determined on having no disorders but
such as called for warm rooms and good nourishment.</p>
<p>In one particular, however, she soon found that he had caught
something from <i>them</i>. "What!" said he. "Do you venture upon
two dishes of strong green tea in one evening? What nerves you must
have! How I envy you. Now, if I were to swallow only one such dish,
what do you think its effect would be upon me?"</p>
<p>"Keep you awake perhaps all night," replied Charlotte, meaning
to overthrow his attempts at surprise, by the grandeur of her own
conceptions.</p>
<p>"Oh, if that were all!" he exclaimed. "No. It acts on me like
poison and would entirely take away the use of my right side before
I had swallowed it five minutes. It sounds almost incredible, but
it has happened to me so often that I cannot doubt it. The use of
my right side is entirely taken away for several hours!"</p>
<p>"It sounds rather odd to be sure," answered Charlotte coolly,
"but I dare say it would be proved to be the simplest thing in the
world by those who have studied right sides and green tea
scientifically and thoroughly understand all the possibilities of
their action on each other."</p>
<p>Soon after tea, a letter was brought to Miss Diana Parker from
the hotel.</p>
<p>"From Mrs. Charles Dupuis," said she, "some private hand."</p>
<p>And, having read a few lines, exclaimed aloud, "Well, this is
very extraordinary! Very extraordinary indeed! That both should
have the same name. Two Mrs. Griffiths! This is a letter of
recommendation and introduction to me of the lady from Camberwell
and <i>her</i> name happens to be Griffiths too."</p>
<p>A few more lines, however, and the colour rushed into her cheeks
and with much perturbation, she added, "The oddest thing that ever
was! A Miss Lambe too! A young West Indian of large fortune. But it
<i>cannot</i> be the same. Impossible that it should be the
same."</p>
<p>She read the letter aloud for comfort. It was merely to
introduce the bearer, Mrs. Griffiths from Camberwell, and the three
young ladies under her care, to Miss Diana Parker's notice. Mrs.
Griffiths, being a stranger at Sanditon, was anxious for a
respectable introduction; and Mrs. Charles Dupuis, therefore, at
the instance of the intermediate friend, provided her with this
letter, knowing that she could not do her dear Diana a greater
kindness than by giving her the means of being useful. "Mrs.
Griffiths' chief solicitude would be for the accommodation and
comfort of one of the young ladies under her care, a Miss Lambe, a
young West Indian of large fortune in delicate health."</p>
<p>It was very strange! Very remarkable! Very extraordinary! But
they were all agreed in determining it to be <i>impossible</i> that
there should not be two families; such a totally distinct set of
people as were concerned in the reports of each made that matter
quite certain. There <i>must</i> be two families. Impossible to be
otherwise. "Impossible" and "Impossible" were repeated over and
over again with great fervour. An accidental resemblance of names
and circumstances, however striking at first, involved nothing
really incredible; and so it was settled.</p>
<p>Miss Diana herself derived an immediate advantage to
counter-balance her perplexity. She must put her shawl over her
shoulders and be running about again. Tired as she was, she must
instantly repair to the hotel to investigate the truth and offer
her services.</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-11" id="Ch-11">Chapter 11</a></h2>
<p>It would not do. Not all that the whole Parker race could say
among themselves could produce a happier <i>catastrophé</i> than
that the family from Surrey and the family from Camberwell were one
and the same. The rich West Indians and the young ladies' seminary
had all entered Sanditon in those two hack chaises. The Mrs.
Griffiths who, in her friend Mrs. Darling's hands, had wavered as
to coming and been unequal to the journey, was the very same Mrs.
Griffiths whose plans were at the same period (under another
representation) perfectly decided, and who was without fears or
difficulties.</p>
<p>All that had the appearance of incongruity in the reports of the
two might very fairly be placed to the account of the vanity, the
ignorance, or the blunders of the many engaged in the cause by the
vigilance and caution of Miss Diana Parker. <i>Her</i> intimate
friends must be officious like herself; and the subject had
supplied letters and extracts and messages enough to make
everything appear what it was not. Miss Diana probably felt a
little awkward on being first obliged to admit her mistake. A long
journey from Hampshire taken for nothing, a brother disappointed,
an expensive house on her hands for a week must have been some of
her immediate reflections; and much worse than all the rest must
have been the sensation of being less clear-sighted and infallible
than she had believed herself.</p>
<p>No part of it, however, seemed to trouble her for long. There
were so many to share in the shame and the blame that probably,
when she had divided out their proper portions to Mrs. Darling,
Miss Capper, Fanny Noyce, Mrs. Charles Dupuis and Mrs. Charles
Dupuis's neighbour, there might be a mere trifle of reproach
remaining for herself. At any rate, she was seen all the following
morning walking about after lodgings with Mrs. Griffiths as alert
as ever.</p>
<p>Mrs. Griffiths was a very well-behaved, genteel kind of woman,
who supported herself by receiving such great girls and young
ladies as wanted either masters for finishing their education or a
home for beginning their displays. She had several more under her
care than the three who were now come to Sanditon, but the others
all happened to be absent. Of these three, and indeed of all, Miss
Lambe was beyond comparison the most important and precious, as she
paid in proportion to her fortune. She was about seventeen, half
mulatto, chilly and tender, had a maid of her own, was to have the
best room in the lodgings, and was always of the first consequence
in every plan of Mrs. Griffiths.</p>
<p>The other girls, two Miss Beauforts, were just such young ladies
as may be met with, in at least one family out of three, throughout
the kingdom. They had tolerable complections, showy figures, an
upright decided carriage and an assured look; they were very
accomplished and very ignorant, their time being divided between
such pursuits as might attract admiration, and those labours and
expedients of dexterous ingenuity by which they could dress in a
style much beyond what they ought to have afforded; they were some
of the first in every change of fashion. And the object of all was
to captivate some man of much better fortune than their own.</p>
<p>Mrs. Griffiths had preferred a small, retired place like
Sanditon on Miss Lambe's account; and the Miss Beauforts, though
naturally preferring anything to smallness and retirement, having
in the course of the spring been involved in the inevitable expense
of six new dresses each for a three-days visit, were constrained to
be satisfied with Sanditon also till their circumstances were
retrieved. There, with the hire of a harp for one and the purchase
of some drawing paper for the other, and all the finery they could
already command, they meant to be very economical, very elegant and
very secluded; with the hope, on Miss Beaufort's side, of praise
and celebrity from all who walked within the sound of her
instrument, and on Miss Letitia's, of curiosity and rapture in all
who came near her while she sketched; and to both, the consolation
of meaning to be the most stylish girls in the place. The
particular introduction of Mrs. Griffiths to Miss Diana Parker
secured them immediately an acquaintance with the Trafalgar House
family and with the Denhams; and the Miss Beauforts were soon
satisfied with "the circle in which they moved in Sanditon," to use
a proper phrase, for everybody must now "move in a circle" to the
prevalence of which rotatory motion is perhaps to be attributed the
giddiness and false steps of many.</p>
<p>Lady Denham had other motives for calling on Mrs. Griffiths
besides attention to the Parkers. In Miss Lambe, here was the very
young lady, sickly and rich, whom she had been asking for; and she
made the acquaintance for Sir Edward's sake and the sake of her
milch asses. How it might answer with regard to the baronet,
remained to be proved, but as to the animals, she soon found that
all her calculations of profit would be vain. Mrs. Griffiths would
not allow Miss Lambe to have the smallest symptom of a decline or
any complaint which asses' milk could possibly relieve. Miss Lambe
was "under the constant care of an experienced physician," and his
prescriptions must be their rule. And except in favour of some
tonic pills, which a cousin of her own had a property in, Mrs.
Griffiths never deviated from the strict medicinal page.</p>
<p>The corner house of the Terrace was the one in which Miss Diana
Parker had the pleasure of settling her new friends; and
considering that it commanded in front the favourite lounge of all
the visitors at Sanditon, and on one side whatever might be going
on at the hotel, there could not have been a more favourable spot
for the seclusion of the Miss Beauforts. And accordingly, long
before they had suited themselves with an instrument or with
drawing paper, they had, by the frequence of their appearance at
the low windows upstairs, in order to close the blinds, or open the
blinds, to arrange a flower pot on the balcony, or look at nothing
through a telescope, attracted many an eye upwards and made many a
gazer gaze again.</p>
<p>A little novelty has a great effect in so small a place. The
Miss Beauforts, who would have been nothing at Brighton, could not
move here without notice. And even Mr. Arthur Parker, though little
disposed for supernumerary exertion, always quitted the Terrace in
his way to his brother's by this corner house, for the sake of a
glimpse of the Miss Beauforts, though it was half a quarter of a
mile round about and added two steps to the ascent of the hill.</p>
<h2><a name="Ch-12" id="Ch-12">Chapter 12</a></h2>
<p>Charlotte had been ten days at Sanditon without seeing Sanditon
House, every attempt at calling on Lady Denham having been defeated
by meeting with her beforehand. But now it was to be more
resolutely undertaken, at a more early hour, that nothing might be
neglected of attention to Lady Denham or amusement to
Charlotte.</p>
<p>"And if you should find a favourable opening, my love," said Mr.
Parker, who did not mean to go with them, "I think you had better
mention the poor Mullins's situation and sound her Ladyship as to a
subscription for them. I am not fond of charitable subscriptions in
a place of this kind&mdash;it is a sort of tax upon all that
come&mdash;yet as their distress is very great and I almost
promised the poor woman yesterday to get something done for her, I
believe we must set a subscription on foot, and, therefore, the
sooner the better; and Lady Denham's name at the head of the list
will be a very necessary beginning. You will not dislike speaking
to her about it, Mary?"</p>
<p>"I will do whatever you wish me," replied his wife, "but you
would do it so much better yourself. I shall not know what to
say."</p>
<p>"My dear Mary," he cried. "It is impossible you can be really at
a loss. Nothing can be more simple. You have only to state the
present afflicted situation of the family, their earnest
application to me, and my being willing to promote a little
subscription for their relief, provided it meet with her
approbation."</p>
<p>"The easiest thing in the world," cried Miss Diana Parker, who
happened to be calling on them at the moment. "All said and done in
less time than you have been talking of it now. And while you are
on the subject of subscriptions, Mary, I will thank you to mention
a very melancholy case to Lady Denham which has been represented to
me in the most affecting terms. There is a poor woman in
Worcestershire, whom some friends of mine are exceedingly
interested about, and I have undertaken to collect whatever I can
for her. If you would mention the circumstance to Lady Denham! Lady
Denham <i>can</i> give, if she is properly attacked. And I look
upon her to be the sort of person who, when once she is prevailed
on to undraw her purse, would as readily give ten guineas as five.
And therefore, if you find her in a giving mood, you might as well
speak in favour of another charity which I and a few more have very
much at heart&mdash;the establishment of a Charitable Repository at
Burton on Trent. And then there is the family of the poor man who
was hung last assizes at York, though we really <i>have</i> raised
the sum we wanted for putting them all out, yet if you <i>can</i>
get a guinea from her on their behalf, it may as well be done."</p>
<p>"My dear Diana!" exclaimed Mrs. Parker, "I could no more mention
these things to Lady Denham than I could fly."</p>
<p>"Where's the difficulty? I wish I could go with you myself. But
in five minutes I must be at Mrs. Griffiths', to encourage Miss
Lambe in taking her first dip. She is so frightened, poor thing,
that I promised to come and keep up her spirits, and go in the
machine with her if she wished it. And as soon as that is over, I
must hurry home, for Susan is to have leeches at one o clock which
will be a three hours' business. Therefore I really have not a
moment to spare. Besides that, between ourselves, I ought to be in
bed myself at this present time, for I am hardly able to stand; and
when the leeches have done, I dare say we shall both go to our
rooms for the rest of the day."</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear it, indeed. But if this is the case I hope
Arthur will come to us."</p>
<p>"If Arthur takes my advice, he will go to bed too, for if he
stays up by himself he will certainly eat and drink more than he
ought. But you see, Mary, how impossible it is for me to go with
you to Lady Denham's."</p>
<p>"Upon second thoughts, Mary," said her husband. "I will not
trouble you to speak about the Mullinses. I will take an
opportunity of seeing Lady Denham myself. I know how little it
suits you to be pressing matters upon a mind at all unwilling."</p>
<p><i>His</i> application thus withdrawn, his sister could say no
more in support of hers, which was his object, as he felt all their
impropriety, and all the certainty of their ill effect upon his own
better claim. Mrs. Parker was delighted at this release and set off
very happy with her friend and her little girl on this walk to
Sanditon House.</p>
<p>It was a close, misty morning and, when they reached the brow of
the hill, they could not for some time make out what sort of
carriage it was which they saw coming up. It appeared at different
moments to be everything from a gig to a phaeton, from one horse to
four; and just as they were concluding in favour of a tandem,
little Mary's young eyes distinguished the coachman and she eagerly
called out, "It is Uncle Sidney, Mama, it is indeed." And so it
proved.</p>
<p>Mr. Sidney Parker, driving his servant in a very neat carriage,
was soon opposite to them, and they all stopped for a few minutes.
The manners of the Parkers were always pleasant among themselves;
and it was a very friendly meeting between Sidney and his
sister-in-law, who was most kindly taking it for granted that he
was on his way to Trafalgar House. This he declined, however. He
was "just come from Eastbourne proposing to spend two or three
days, as it might happen, at Sanditon" but the hotel must be his
quarters. He was expecting to be joined there by a friend or
two.</p>
<p>The rest was common enquiries and remarks, with kind notice of
little Mary, and a very well-bred bow and proper address to Miss
Heywood on her being named to him. And they parted to meet again
within a few hours. Sidney Parker was about seven or eight and
twenty, very good-looking, with a decided air of ease and fashion
and a lively countenance. This adventure afforded agreeable
discussion for some time. Mrs. Parker entered into all her
husband's joy on the occasion and exulted in the credit which
Sidney's arrival would give to the place.</p>
<p>The road to Sanditon House was a broad, handsome, planted
approach between fields, leading at the end of a quarter of a mile
through second gates into grounds which, though not extensive, had
all the beauty and respectability which an abundance of very fine
timber could give. These entrance gates were so much in a corner of
the grounds or paddock, so near to one of its boundaries, that an
outside fence was at first almost pressing on the road, till an
angle <i>here</i> and a curve <i>there</i> threw them to a better
distance. The fence was a proper park paling in excellent
condition, with clusters of fine elms or rows of old thorns
following its line almost everywhere.</p>
<p><i>Almost</i> must be stipulated, for there were vacant spaces,
and through one of these, Charlotte, as soon as they entered the
enclosure, caught a glimpse over the pales of something white and
womanish in the field on the other side. It was something which
immediately brought Miss Brereton into her head; and stepping to
the pales, she saw indeed and very decidedly, in spite of the mist,
Miss Brereton seated not far before her at the foot of the bank,
which sloped down from the outside of the paling, and which a
narrow path seemed to skirt along&mdash;Miss Brereton seated,
apparently very composedly&mdash;and Sir Edward Denham by her
side.</p>
<p>They were sitting so near each other and appeared so closely
engaged in gentle conversation that Charlotte instantly felt she
had nothing to do but to step back again and say not a word.
Privacy was certainly their object. It could not but strike her
rather unfavourably with regard to Clara; but hers was a situation
which must not be judged with severity.</p>
<p>She was glad to perceive that nothing had been discerned by Mrs.
Parker. If Charlotte had not been considerably the taller of the
two, Miss Brereton's white ribbons might not have fallen within the
ken of <i>her</i> more observant eyes. Among other points of
moralising reflection which the sight of this tête-à-tête produced,
Charlotte could not but think of the extreme difficulty which
secret lovers must have in finding a proper spot for their stolen
interviews. Here perhaps they had thought themselves so perfectly
secure from observation; the whole field open before them, a steep
bank and pales never crossed by the foot of man at their back, and
a great thickness of air to aid them as well! Yet here she had seen
them. They were really ill-used.</p>
<p>The house was large and handsome. Two servants appeared to admit
them and everything had a suitable air of property and order, Lady
Denham valued herself upon her liberal establishment and had great
enjoyment in the order and importance of her style of living. They
were shown into the usual sitting room, well proportioned and well
furnished, though it was furniture rather originally good and
extremely well kept than new or showy. And as Lady Denham was not
there, Charlotte had leisure to look about her and to be told by
Mrs. Parker that the whole-length portrait of a stately gentleman
which, placed over the mantelpiece, caught the eye immediately, was
the picture of Sir Henry Denham; and that one among many miniatures
in another part of the room, little conspicuous, represented Mr.
Hollis, poor Mr. Hollis! It was impossible not to feel him hardly
used: to be obliged to stand back in his own house and see the best
place by the fire constantly occupied by Sir Harry Denham.</p>
