  &ldquo;Let Some One Speak!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The  hour of noon had just struck, and the few visitors still lingering among the  curiosities of the great museum were suddenly startled by the sight of one of  the attendants running down the broad, central staircase, loudly shouting:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Close  the doors! Let no one out! An accident has occurred, and nobody&rsquo;s to leave the  building.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was but one person near either of the doors, and as he chanced to be a man  closely connected with the museum,&mdash;being, in fact, one of its most active  directors,&mdash;he immediately turned about and in obedience to a gesture made by  the attendant, ran up the marble steps, followed by some dozen others.</p>
  <p>At  the top they all turned, as by common consent, toward the left-hand gallery,  where in the section marked II, a tableau greeted them which few of them will  ever forget.</p>
  <p>I  say &ldquo;tableau&rdquo; because the few persons concerned in it stood as in a picture,  absolutely motionless and silent as the dead. Sense, if not feeling, was  benumbed in them all, as in another moment it was benumbed in the breasts of  these new arrivals. Tragedy was there in its most terrible, its most pathetic,  aspect. The pathos was given by the victim,&mdash;a young and pretty girl lying face  upward on the tessellated floor with an arrow in her breast and death stamped  unmistakably on every feature,&mdash;the terror by the look and attitude of the woman  they saw kneeling over her&mdash;a remarkable woman, no longer young, but of a  presence to hold the attention, even if the circumstances had been of a far  less tragic nature. Her hand was on the arrow but she had made no movement to  withdraw it, and her eyes, fixed upon space, showed depths of horror hardly to  be explained even by the suddenness and startling character of the untoward  fatality of which she had just been made the unhappy witness.</p>
  <p>The  director, whose name was Roberts, thought as he paused on the edge of the crowd  that he had never seen a countenance upon which woe had stamped so deep a mark;  and greatly moved by it, he was about to seek some explanation of a scene to  which appearances gave so little clue, when the tall but stooping figure of the  Curator entered, and he found himself relieved from a task whose seriousness he  had no difficulty in measuring.</p>
  <p>To  those who knew William Jewett well, it was evident that he had been called from  some task which still occupied his thoughts and for the moment somewhat  bewildered his understanding. But as he was a conscientious man and quite  capable of taking the lead when once roused to the exigencies of an occasion,  Mr. Roberts felt a certain interest in watching the slow awakening of this  self-absorbed man to the awful circumstances which in one instant had clouded  the museum in an atmosphere of mysterious horror.</p>
  <p>When  the full realization came,&mdash;which was not till a way had been made for him to  the side of the stricken woman crouching over the dead child,&mdash;the energy which  transformed his countenance and gave character to his usually bent and  inconspicuous figure was all if not more than the anxious director expected.</p>
  <p>Finding  that his attempts to meet the older woman&rsquo;s eye only prolonged the suspense,  the Curator addressed her quietly, and in sympathetic tones inquired whose  child this was and how so dreadful a thing had happened.</p>
  <p>She  did not answer. She did not even look his way. With a rapid glance into the  faces about him, ending in one of deep compassion directed toward herself, he  repeated his question.</p>
  <p>Still  no response&mdash;still that heavy silence, that absolute immobility of face and  limb. If her faculty of hearing was dulled, possibly she would yield to that of  touch. Stooping, he laid his hand on her arm.</p>
  <p>This  roused her. Slowly her eyes lost their fixed stare and took on a more human  light. A shudder shook her frame, and gazing down into the countenance of the  young girl lying at her feet, she broke into moans of such fathomless despair  as wrung the hearts of all about her.</p>
  <p>It  was a scene to test the nerve of any man. To one of the Curator&rsquo;s sympathetic  temperament it was well-nigh unendurable. Turning to those nearest, he begged  for an explanation of what they saw before them:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  one here must be able to tell me. Let that some one speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this the quietest and least conspicuous person present, a young man heavily  spectacled and of student-like appearance, advanced a step and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was the first person to come in here after this poor young lady fell. I was  looking at coins just beyond the partition there, when I heard a gasping cry. I  had not heard her fall&mdash;I fear I was very much preoccupied in my search for an  especial coin I had been told I should find here&mdash;but I did hear the cry she  gave, and startled by the sound, left the section where I was and entered this  one, only to see just what you are seeing now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Curator pointed at the two women.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This?  The one woman kneeling over the other with her hand on the arrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  change took place in the Curator&rsquo;s expression. Involuntarily his eyes rose to  the walls hung closely with Indian relics, among which was a quiver in which  all could see arrows similar to the one now in the breast of the young girl  lying dead before them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  woman must be made to speak,&rdquo; he said in answer to the low murmur which  followed this discovery. &ldquo;If there is a doctor present&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Waiting,  but receiving no response, he withdrew his hand from the woman&rsquo;s arm and laid  it on the arrow.</p>
  <p>This  roused her completely. Loosing her own grasp upon the shaft, she cried, with  sudden realization of the people pressing about her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not draw it. That causes death, they say. Wait! she may still be alive.  She may have a word to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was bending to listen. It was hardly a favorable moment for further  questioning, but the Curator in his anxiety could not refrain from saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is she? What is her name and what is yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  name?&rdquo; repeated the woman, rising to face him again. &ldquo;How should I know? I was  passing through this gallery and had just stopped to take a look into the court  when this young girl bounded by me from behind and flinging up her arms, fell  with a deep sigh to the floor. I saw an arrow in her breast, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Emotion  choked her, and when some one asked if the girl was a stranger to her, she  simply bowed her head; then, letting her gaze pass from face to face till it  had completed the circle of those about her, she said in her former mechanical  way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name is Ermentrude Taylor. I came to look at the bronzes. I should like to go  now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the crowd which had formed about her was too compact to allow her to pass.  Besides, the director, Mr. Roberts, had something to say first. Working his way  forward, he waited till he had attracted her attention and then remarked in his  most considerate manner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will pardon these importunities, Mrs. Taylor. I am a director of this museum,  and if Mr. Jewett will excuse me,&rdquo;&mdash;here he bowed to the Curator,&mdash;&ldquo;I should like  to inquire from what direction the arrow came which ended this young girl&rsquo;s  life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a moment she stood aghast, fixing him with her eye as though to ask whither  this inquiry tended. Then with an air of intention which was not without some  strange element of fear, she allowed her glance to travel across the court till  it rested upon the row of connected arches facing them from the opposite  gallery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said he, putting her look into words, &ldquo;you think the arrow came from the other  side of the building. Did you see anyone over there,&mdash;in the gallery, I mean,&mdash;at  or before the instant of this young girl&rsquo;s fall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  any of <i>you</i>?&rdquo; he urged, with his eyes on the crowd. &ldquo;Some one must have  been looking that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  no answer came, and the silence was fast becoming oppressive when these words,  whispered by one woman to another, roused them anew and sent every glance again  to the walls&mdash;even hers for whose benefit this remark had possibly been made:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there are no arrows over there. All the arrows are here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was right. They were here, quiver after quiver of them; nor were they all  beyond reach. As the woman thus significantly assailed noted this and saw with  what suspicion others noted it also, a decided change took place in her aspect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to sit down,&rdquo; she murmured. Possibly she was afraid she might fall.</p>
  <p>As  some one brought a chair, she spoke, but very tremulously, to the director:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  there no arrows in the rooms over there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite sure not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no bows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if  anyone had been seen in the gallery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard the question asked. It brought no answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but  these galleries are visible from below. Some one may have been looking up from  the court and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  there was any such person in the building, he would have been here by this  time. People don&rsquo;t hold back such information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo;  she stammered, her eyes taking on a hunted look, &ldquo;you conclude&mdash;these people  conclude <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;&mdash;the  word came coldly, stinging her into drawing herself to her full height,&mdash;&ldquo;it is  not for me to conclude in a case like this. That is the business of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this word, with its suggestion of crime, her air of conscious power vanished in  sudden collapse. Possibly she had seen the significant gesture with which the  Curator pointed out a quiver from which one of the arrows was missing. That  this was so, was shown by her next question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  where is the bow? Look about on the floor. You will find none. How can an arrow  be shot without a bow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  cannot be,&rdquo; came from some one at her back. &ldquo;But it can be driven home like a  dagger if the hand wielding it is sufficiently powerful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  cry left her lips; she seemed to listen as for some echo; then in a wild  abandonment which ignored person and place she flung herself again at the dead  girl&rsquo;s side, and before the astonished people surrounding her could intervene,  she had caught up the body in her arms, and bending over it, whispered word  after word into the poor child&rsquo;s closed ear.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="II"></a><b>II<br>
    In Room B</b></h2>
  <p>Five  minutes later the Curator was at the &lsquo;phone calling up Police Headquarters. A  death had occurred at the museum. Would they send over a capable detective?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  kind of death?&rdquo; was the harsh reply. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t send detectives in cases of  heart-failure or simple accident. Is it an accident?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;hardly.  It looks more like an insane woman&rsquo;s attack upon a harmless stranger. It&rsquo;s the  oddest sort of an affair, and we feel very helpless. No common officer will do.  We have one of that kind in the building. What we want is a man of brains; he  will need them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  muffled sound at the other end&mdash;then a different voice asking some half-dozen  comprehensive questions&mdash;which, having been answered to the best of the Curator&rsquo;s  ability, were followed by the welcome assurance that a man on whose experience  he could rely would be at the museum doors within five minutes.</p>
  <p>With  an air of relief Mr. Jewett stepped again into the court, and repelling with  hasty gestures the importunities of the small group of men and women who had  lacked the courage to follow the more adventurous ones upstairs, crossed to  where the door-man stood on guard over the main entrance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Locked?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. Such were the orders. Didn&rsquo;t you give them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I should have done so, had I known. No one&rsquo;s to go out, and no one&rsquo;s to  come in but the detective whom I am expecting any moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  had not long to wait. Before their suspense had reached fever-point, a tap was  heard on the great door. It was opened, and a young man stepped in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coast  clear?&rdquo; he sang out with a humorous twist of his jaw as he noted the Curator&rsquo;s  evident chagrin at his meager and unsatisfactory appearance. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not your  man,&rdquo; he added as his eye ran over the whole place with a look which seemed to  take in every detail in an instant. &ldquo;Mr. Gryce is in the automobile. Wait till  I help him up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was gone before the Curator could utter a word, only to reappear in a few  minutes with a man in his wake whom the former at first blush thought to be as  much past the age where experience makes for efficiency as the other seemed to  be short of it.</p>
  <p>But  this impression, if impression it were, was of short duration. No sooner had  this physically weak but extremely wise old man entered upon the scene than his  mental power became evident to every person there. Timorous hearts regained  their composure, and the Curator&mdash;who in his ten years of service had never felt  the burden of his position so acutely as in the last ten minutes&mdash;showed his  relief by a volubility quite unnatural to him under ordinary conditions. As he  conducted the detectives across the court, he talked not of the victim, as  might reasonably be expected, but of the woman who had been found leaning over  her with her hand on the arrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  think her some escaped lunatic,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Only a demented woman would act  as she does. First she denied all knowledge of the girl. Then when she was made  to see that the arrow sticking in the girl&rsquo;s breast had been taken from a  quiver hanging within arm&rsquo;s reach on the wall and used as lances are used, she  fell a-moaning and crying, and began to whisper in the poor child&rsquo;s senseless  ear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  common woman? One of a low-down type?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. A lady, and an impressive one, at that. You seldom see her equal. That&rsquo;s  what has upset us so. The crime and the criminal do not seem to fit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective blinked. Then suddenly he seemed to grow an inch taller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Room B, away from the crowd. She is not alone. A young lady detained with the  rest of the people here is keeping her company, to say nothing of an officer we  have put on guard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the victim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lies  where she fell, in Section II on the upper floor. There was no call to move  her. She was dead when we came upon the scene. She does not look to be more  than sixteen years old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  go up. But wait&mdash;can we see that section from here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were standing at the foot of the great staircase connecting the two floors.  Above them, stretching away on either side, ran the two famous, highly  ornamented galleries, with their row of long, low arches indicating the five  compartments into which they were severally divided. Pointing to the second one  on the southern side, the Curator replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  it&mdash;the one where you see the Apache relics hanging high on the rear wall. We  shall have to shift those to some other place just as soon as we can recover  from this horror. I don&rsquo;t want the finest spot in the whole museum made a Mecca  for the morbid and the curious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  remark fell upon unheeding ears. Detective Gryce was looking, not in the  direction named, but in the one directly opposite to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; he quietly observed, &ldquo;that there is a clear view across. Was there no one  in the right-hand gallery to see what went on in the left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I have heard of. It&rsquo;s the dullest hour of the day, and not only this  gallery but many of the rooms were entirely empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. And now, what about the persons who were here? How many of them have you  let go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one; the doors have been opened twice only&mdash;once to admit the officer you will  find on guard, and the other to let in yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  And how many have you here, all told?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not had time to count them, but I should say less than thirty. This  includes myself, as well as two attendants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a thoughtful air Mr. Gryce turned in the direction of the few persons he could  see huddled together around one of the central statues.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are the others?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upstairs&mdash;in  and about the place where the poor child lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  must be got out of there. Sweetwater!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man who had entered with him was at his side in an instant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clear  the galleries. Then take down the name and address of every person in the  building.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  the last word had left his lips, the busy fellow was halfway up the marble  steps. &ldquo;Lightning,&rdquo; some of his pals called him, perhaps because he was as  noiseless as he was quick. Meanwhile the senior detective had drawn the Curator  to one side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  take a look at these people as they come down. I have been said to be able to  spot a witness with my eyes shut. Let&rsquo;s see what I can do with my eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young  and old, rich and poor,&rdquo; murmured the Curator as some dozen persons appeared at  the top of the staircase.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  sighed the detective, noting each one carefully as he or she filed down, &ldquo;we  sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t make much out of this experiment. Not one of them avoids our looks.  Emotion enough, but not of the right sort. Well, we&rsquo;ll leave them to  Sweetwater. Our business is above.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Curator offered his arm. The old man made a move to take it&mdash;then drew himself  up with an air of quiet confidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Many  thanks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I can go alone. Rheumatism is my trouble, but these mild  days loosen its grip upon my poor old muscles.&rdquo; He did not say that the  prospect of an interesting inquiry had much the same effect, but the Curator  suspected it, possibly because he was feeling just a little bit spry himself.</p>
  <p>Steeled  as such experienced officers necessarily are to death in all its phases, it was  with no common emotion that the aged detective entered the presence of the dead  girl and took his first look at this latest victim of mental or moral  aberration. So young! so innocent! so fair! A schoolgirl, or little more, of a  class certainly above the average, whether judged from the contour of her  features or the niceties of her dress. With no evidences of great wealth about  her, there was yet something in the cut of her garments and the careful  attention to each detail which bespoke not only natural but cultivated taste.  On her breast just above the spot where the cruel dart had entered, a fresh and  blooming nosegay still exhaled its perfume&mdash;a tragic detail accentuating the  pathos of a death so sudden that the joy with which she had pinned on this  simple adornment seemed to linger about her yet.</p>
  <p>The  detective, with no words for this touching spectacle, stretched out his hand  and with a reverent and fatherly touch pressed down the lids over the unseeing  eyes. This office done to the innocent dead, he asked if anything had been  found to establish the young girl&rsquo;s identity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo;  he observed, &ldquo;she was not without a purse or handbag. All young ladies carry  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer the officer on guard thrust his hand into one of his capacious pockets,  and drawing out a neat little bag of knitted beads, passed it over to the  detective with the laconic remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so it proved. It held only a pocket handkerchief&mdash;embroidered but without a  monogram&mdash;and a memorandum-book without an entry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  blind alley, if ever there was one,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Gryce; and ordering the  policeman to replace the bag as nearly as possible on the spot from which it  had been taken, he proceeded with the Curator to Room B.</p>
  <p>Prepared  to encounter a woman of disordered mind, the appearance presented by Mrs.  Taylor at his entrance greatly astonished Mr. Gryce. There was a calmness in  her attitude which one would scarcely expect to see in a woman whom mania had  just driven into crime. Surely lunacy does not show such self-restraint; nor  does lunacy awaken any such feelings of awe as followed a prolonged scrutiny of  her set but determined features. Only grief of the most intense and sacred  character could account for the aspect she presented, and as the man to whom  the tragedies of life were of daily occurrence took in this mystery with all  its incongruities, he realized, not without a sense of professional pleasure,  no doubt, that he had before him an affair calling for the old-time judgment  which, for forty or more years, had made his record famous in the police annals  of the metropolis.</p>
  <p>She  was seated with no one near her but a young lady whom sympathetic interest had  drawn to her side. Mr. Roberts stood in one of the windows, and not far from  him a man in the museum uniform.</p>
  <p>At  the authoritative advance of the old detective, the woman, whose eye he had  caught, attempted to struggle to her feet, but desisted after a moment of  hopeless effort, and sank back in her chair. There was no pretense in this.  Though gifted with a strong frame, emotion had so weakened her that she was  simply unable to stand. Quite convinced of this, and affected in spite of  himself by her look of lofty patience, Mr. Gryce prefaced his questions with an  apology&mdash;quite an unusual proceeding for him.</p>
  <p>Whether  or no she heard it, he could not tell; but she was quite ready to answer when  he asked her name and then her place of residence&mdash;saying in response to the  latter query:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  live at the Calderon, a family hotel in Sixty-seventh Street. My name&rdquo;&mdash;here she  paused for a second to moisten her lips&mdash;&ldquo;is Taylor&mdash;Ermentrude Taylor....  Nothing else,&rdquo; she speedily added in a tone which drew every eye her way. Then  more evenly: &ldquo;You will find the name on the hotel&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wife  or widow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  a voice! how it reached every heart, waking strange sympathies there! As the  word fell, not a person in the room but stirred uneasily. Even she herself  started at its sound; and moved, perhaps, by the depth of silence which  followed, she added in suppressed tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  widow within the hour. That&rsquo;s why you see me still in colors, but crushed as  you behold&mdash;killed! killed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  settled it. There was no mistaking her condition after an expression of this  kind. The Curator and Mr. Gryce exchanged glances, and Mr. Roberts, stepping  from his corner, betrayed the effect which her words had produced on him, by  whispering in the detective&rsquo;s ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  you need is an alienist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had  she heard? It would seem so from the quick way she roused and exclaimed with  indignant emphasis:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not understand me! I see that I must drink my bitter cup to the dregs. This  is what I mean: My husband was living this morning&mdash;living up to the hour when  the clock in this building struck twelve. I knew it from the joyous hopes with  which my breast was filled. But with the stroke of noon the blow fell. I was  bending above the poor child who had fallen so suddenly at my feet, when the  vision came, and I saw him gazing at me from a distance so remote&mdash;across a  desert so immeasurable&mdash;that nothing but death could create such a removal or  make of him the ghastly silhouette I saw. He is dead. At that moment I felt his  soul pass; and so I say that I am a widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ravings?  No, the calm certainty of her tone, the grief, touching depths so profound it  had no need of words, showed the confidence she felt in the warning she  believed herself to have received. Though probably not a single person present  put any faith in occultism in any of its forms, there was a general movement of  sympathy which led Mr. Gryce to pass the matter by without any attempt at  controversy, and return to the question in hand. With a decided modification of  manner, he therefore asked her to relate how she came to be kneeling over the  injured girl with her hand upon the arrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me have a moment in which to recover myself,&rdquo; she prayed, covering her eyes  with her hand. Then, while all waited, she gave a low cry, &ldquo;I suffer; I suffer!&rdquo;  and leaped to her feet, only to sink back again inert and powerless. But only  for an instant: with that one burst of extreme feeling she recovered her  self-control, answering with apparent calmness the detective&rsquo;s question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was passing through the gallery as any other visitor might, when a young lady  rushed by me&mdash;stopped short&mdash;threw up her arms and fell backward to the floor,  pierced to the heart by an arrow. In a moment I was on my knees at her side  with hand outstretched to withdraw this dreadful arrow. But I was afraid&mdash;I had  heard that this sometimes causes death, and while I was hesitating, that vision  came, engulfing everything. I could think of nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was near collapsing again; but being a woman of great nerve, she fought her  weakness and waited patiently for the next question. It was different, without  doubt, from any she had expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you positively deny any active connection with the strange death of this young  girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  pause, as if to take in what he meant. Then slowly, impressively, came the  answer:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see the person who shot the arrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  what direction would it have had to come to strike her as it did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the opposite balcony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see anyone there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you heard the arrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  arrow shot from a bow makes a whizzing sound as it flies. Didn&rsquo;t you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She looked troubled and uncertain. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. I was  expecting no such thing&mdash;I was not prepared. The sight of an arrow&mdash;a killing  arrow&mdash;in that innocent breast overcame me with inexpressible grief and horror.  If the vision of my husband had not followed, I might remember more. As it is,  I have told all I can. Won&rsquo;t you excuse me? I should like to go. I am not fit  to remain. I want to return home&mdash;to hear from my husband&mdash;to learn by letter or  telegram whether he is indeed dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce had let her finish. An inquiry so unofficial might easily await the moods  of such a witness. Not till the last word had been followed by what some there  afterward called a hungry silence, did he make use of his prerogative to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be pleased to release you and will do so just as soon as I can. But I must  put one or two more questions. Were you interested in the Indian relics you had  come among? Did you handle any of them in passing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I had no interest. I like glass, bronzes, china&mdash;I hate weapons. I shall hate  them eternally after this.&rdquo; And she began to shudder.</p>
  <p>The  detective, with a quick bend of his head, approached her ear with the whispered  remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am told that when your attention was drawn to these weapons, you fell on your  knees and murmured something into the dead girl&rsquo;s ears. How do you explain  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was giving her messages to my husband. I felt&mdash;strange as it may seem to  you&mdash;that they had fled the earth together&mdash;and I wanted him to know that I would  be constant, and other foolish things you will not wish me to repeat here. Is  that all you wish to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce bowed, and cast a quizzical glance in the direction of the Curator.  Certainly for oddity this case transcended any he had had in years. With this  woman eliminated from the situation, what explanation was there of the curious death  he was there to investigate? As he was meditating how he could best convey to  her the necessity of detaining her further, he heard a muttered exclamation  from the young woman standing near her, and following the direction of her  pointing finger, saw that the strange silence which had fallen upon the room  had a cause. Mrs. Taylor had fainted away in her chair.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="III"></a><b>III<br>
  &ldquo;I Have Something To Show You&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce took advantage of the momentary disturbance to slip from the room. He was  followed by the Curator, who seemed more than ever anxious to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see! Mad as a March hare!&rdquo; was his hurried exclamation as the door closed  behind them. &ldquo;I declare I do not know which I pity more, her victim or herself.  The one is freed from all her troubles; the other&mdash;Do you think we ought to have  a doctor to look after her? Shall I telephone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet. We have much to learn before taking any decided steps.&rdquo; Then as he caught  the look of amazement with which this unexpected suggestion of difficulties was  met, he paused on his way to the stair-head to ask in a tentative way  peculiarly his own: &ldquo;Then you still think the girl died from a thrust given by  this woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. What else is there to think? You saw where the arrow came from. You saw  that the only bow the place contained was hanging high and unstrung upon the  wall, and you are witness to this woman&rsquo;s irresponsible condition of mind. The  sight of those arrows well within her reach evidently aroused the homicidal  mania often latent in one of her highly emotional nature; and when this fresh  young girl came by, the natural result followed. I only hope I shall not be  called upon to face the poor child&rsquo;s parents. What can I say to them? What can  anybody say? Yet I do not see how we can be held responsible for so unprecedented  an attack as this, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce made no answer. He had turned his back toward the stair-head and was  wondering if this easy explanation of a tragedy so peculiar as to have no  prototype in all of the hundreds of cases he had been called upon to  investigate in a long life of detective activity would satisfy all the other  persons then in the building. It was his present business to find out&mdash;to search  and probe among the dozen or two people he saw collected below, for the witness  who had seen or had heard some slight thing as yet unrevealed which would throw  a different light upon this matter. For his mind&mdash;or shall we say the almost  unerring instinct of this ancient delver into human hearts?&mdash;would not accept  without question this theory of sudden madness in one of Mrs. Taylor&rsquo;s  appearance, strange and inexplicable as her conduct seemed. Though it was quite  among the possibilities that she had struck the fatal blow and in the manner  mentioned, it was equally clear to his mind that she had not done it in an  access of frenzy. He knew a mad eye and he knew a despairing one. Fantastic as  her story certainly was, he found himself more ready to believe it than to  accept any explanation of this crime which ascribed its peculiar features to  the irresponsibilities of lunacy.</p>
  <p>However,  he kept his impressions to himself and in his anxiety to pursue his inquiries  among the people below, was on the point of descending thither, when he found  his attention arrested, and that of the Curator&rsquo;s as well, by the sight of a  young man hastening toward them through the northern gallery. (The tragedy, as  you will remember, had occurred in the southern one.) He was dressed in the  uniform of the museum, and moved so quickly and in such an evident flurry of  spirits that the detective instinctively asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  that? One of your own men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s Correy, our best-informed and most-trusted attendant. Looks as if he had  something to tell us. Well, Correy, what is it?&rdquo; he queried as the man emerged  upon the landing where they stood. &ldquo;Anything new? If there is, speak out  plainly. Mr. Gryce is anxious for all the evidence he can get.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  an ingenuousness rather pleasing than otherwise to the man thus presented to  his notice, the young fellow stopped short and subjected the famous detective  to a keen and close scrutiny before venturing to give the required information.</p>
  <p>Was  it because of the importance of what he had to communicate? It would seem so,  from the suppressed excitement of his tone, as after his brief but exceedingly  satisfactory survey, he jerked his finger over his shoulder in the direction  from which he had come, with the short remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have something to show you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something!  Mr. Gryce had been asking for this something only a moment before. We can  imagine, then, the celerity with which he followed this new guide into the one  spot of all others which possessed for him the greatest interest. For if by any  chance the arrow which had done such deadly work had been sped from a bow  instead of having been used as a dart, then it was from this gallery and from  no other quarter of the building that it had been so sped. Any proof of this  could have but the one effect of exonerating from all blame the woman who had  so impressed him. He had traversed the first section and had entered the  second, when the Curator joined him; together they passed into the third.</p>
  <p>For  those who have not visited this museum, a more detailed description of these  galleries may be welcome. Acting as a means of communication between the row of  front rooms and those at the back, they also serve to exhibit certain choice  articles which call for little space, and are of a nature more or less  ornamental. For this purpose they are each divided into five sections connected  by arches narrower but not less decorative than those which open in a direct  row upon the court. Of these sections the middle one on either side is much  larger than the rest; otherwise they do not differ.</p>
  <p>It  was in the midst of this larger section that Correy now stood, awaiting their  approach. There had been show-cases filled with rare exhibits in the two  through which they had just passed, but in this one there was nothing to be  seen but a gorgeous hanging, covering very nearly the whole wall, flanked at  either end by a pedestal upholding a vase of inestimable value and  corresponding ugliness. A highly decorative arrangement, it is true, but in  what lay its interest for the criminal investigator?</p>
  <p>Correy  was soon to show them. With a significant gesture toward the tapestry, he  eagerly exclaimed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see that? I&rsquo;ve run by it several times since the accident sent me flying all  over the building at everybody&rsquo;s call. But only just now, when I had a moment  to myself, did I remember the door hid behind it. It&rsquo;s a door we no longer use,  and I&rsquo;d no reason for thinking it had anything to do with the killing of the  young lady in the opposite gallery. But for all that I felt it would do no harm  to give it a look, and running from the front, where I happened to be, I pulled  out the tapestry and saw&mdash;but supposing I wait and let you see for yourselves.  That will be better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leaving  them where they stood face to face with the great hanging, he made a dive for  the pedestal towering aloft at the farther end, and edging himself in behind  it, drew out the tapestry from the wall, calling on them as he did so to come  and look behind it. The Curator did not hesitate. He was there almost as soon  as the young man himself.</p>
  <p>But  the detective was not so hasty. With a thousand things in mind, he stopped to  peer along the gallery and down into the court before giving himself away to  any prying eye. Satisfied that he might make the desired move with impunity,  Mr. Gryce was about to turn in the desired direction when, struck by a new  fact, he again stopped short.</p>
  <p>He  had noticed how the heavy tapestry shivered under Correy&rsquo;s clutch. Had this  been observed by anyone besides himself? If by chance some person wandering  about the court had been looking up&mdash;but no, the few people gathered there stood  too far forward to see what was going on in this part of the gallery; and  relieved from all further anxiety on this score, he joined Correy at the  pedestal and at a word from him succeeded in squeezing himself around it into  the small space they had left for him between the pushed-out hanging and the  wall. An exclamation from the Curator, who had only waited for his coming to  take his first look, added zest to his own scrutiny. It would take something  more than the sight of a well-known door to give it such a tone of astonished  discovery. What? Even he, with the accumulated surprises of years to give wings  to his imagination, did not succeed in guessing. But when his eyes, once  accustomed to the semi-darkness of the narrow space which Correy had thus  opened out before him, saw not the door but what lay within its recess, he  acknowledged to himself that he should have guessed&mdash;and that a dozen years  before, he certainly would have done so.</p>
  <p>It  was a <i>bow</i>&mdash;not like the one hanging high in the Apache exhibit, but yet a  bow strong of make and strung for use.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>Here  was a discovery as important as it was unexpected, eliminating Mrs. Taylor at  once from the case and raising it into a mystery of the first order. By dint of  long custom, Mr. Gryce succeeded in hiding his extreme satisfaction, but not  the perplexity into which he was thrown by this complete change of base. The  Curator appeared to be impressed in much the same way, and shook his head in a  doubtful fashion when Correy asked him if he recognized the bow as belonging to  the museum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should have to see it nearer to answer that question with any sort of  confidence,&rdquo; he demurred. &ldquo;From such glimpses as I can get of it from here I  should say that it has not been taken from any of our exhibits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure it has not,&rdquo; muttered Correy. Then with a side glance at Mr. Gryce, he  added: &ldquo;Shall I slip in behind and get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective, thus appealed to, hesitated a moment; then with an irrelevance  perhaps natural to the occasion, he inquired where this door so conveniently  hidden from the general view led to. It was the Curator who answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  a twisting, breakneck staircase opening directly into my office. But this door  has not been used in years. See! Here is the key to it on my own ring. There is  no other. I lost the mate to it myself not long after my installation here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective, working his way back around the pedestal, cast another glance up and  down the gallery and over into the court. Still no spying eye, save that of the  officer opposite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will leave that bow where it is for the present,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;a secret between  us three.&rdquo; And motioning for Correy to let the tapestry fall, he stood watching  it settle into place, till it hung quite straight again, with its one edge  close to the wall and the other sweeping the floor. Had its weight been great  enough to push the bow back again into its former place close against the door?  Yes. No eye, however trained, would, from any bulge in the heavy tapestry,  detect its presence there. He could leave the spot without fear; their secret  would remain theirs until such time as they chose to disclose it.</p>
  <p>As  the three walked back the way they had come, the Curator glanced earnestly at  the detective, who seemed to have fallen into a kind of anxious dream. Would it  do to interrupt him with questions? Would he obtain a straight answer if he  did? The old man moved heavily but the now fully alert Curator could not fail  to see that it was with the heaviness of absorbed thought. Dare he disturb that  thought? They had both reached the broad corridor separating the two galleries  at the western end before he ventured to remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  discovery alters matters, does it not? May I ask what you propose to do now?  Anything in which we can help you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective may have heard him and he may not; at all events he made no reply  though he continued to advance with a mechanical step until he stood again at  the top of the marble steps leading down into the court. Here some of the  uncertainty pervading his mind seemed to leave him, though he still looked very  old and very troubled, or so the Curator thought, as pausing there, he allowed  his glance to wander from the marble recesses below to the galleries on either  side of him, and from these on to the seemingly empty spaces back of the high,  carved railing guarding the great well. Would a younger man have served them  better? It began to look so; then without warning and in a flash, as it were,  the whole appearance of the octogenarian detective changed, and turning with a  smile to the two men so anxiously watching him, he exclaimed with an air of  quiet triumph:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have it. Follow and see how my plan works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Amazed,  for he looked and moved like another man,&mdash;a man in whom the almost extinguished  spark of early genius had suddenly flared again into full blaze,&mdash;they hastily  joined him in anticipation of they knew not what. But their enthusiasm received  a check when at the moment of descent Mr. Gryce again turned back with the  remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had forgotten. I have something to do first. If you will kindly see that the  people down there are kept from growing too impatient, I will soon join you  with Mrs. Taylor, who must not be left on this floor after we have gone below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with no further explanation of his purpose, he turned and proceeded without  delay to Room B.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="IV"></a><b>IV<br>
    A Strategic Move</b></h2>
  <p>He  found the unhappy woman quite recovered from her fainting spell, but still  greatly depressed and not a little incoherent. He set himself to work to soothe  her, for he had a request to make which called for an intelligent answer.  Relieved from all suspicion of her having been an active agent in the  deplorable deed he was here to investigate, he was lavish in his promises of  speedy release, and seeing how much this steadied her, he turned to Mr.  Roberts, who was still in the room, and then to the young lady who had been  giving her a woman&rsquo;s care, and signified that their attentions were no longer  required and that he would be glad to have them join the people below.</p>
  <p>When  the door had closed and Mr. Gryce found himself for the first time alone with  Mrs. Taylor, he drew up a chair to her side and remarked in his old benevolent  way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel guilty of cruelty, madam, in repeating a question you have already  answered. But the conditions are such that I must, and do it now. When this  young lady fell so unexpectedly at your feet, was your first look at her or at  the opposite gallery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  an instant her eyes held his&mdash;something which did not often happen to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  her,&rdquo; she vehemently declared. &ldquo;I never thought of looking anywhere else. I saw  her at my feet, and fell on my knees at her side. Who wouldn&rsquo;t have done so!  Who would have seen anything but that arrow&mdash;<i>that arrow</i>! Oh, it was  terrible! Do not make me recall it. I have sorrows enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Taylor, you have my utmost sympathy. But you must realize how important it is for  me to make sure that you saw nothing in the place from which that arrow was  sent which would help us to locate the author of this accident. The flitting of  an escaping figure up or down the opposite gallery, even a stir in the great  tapestry confronting you from that far-away wall, might give us a clue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw nothing,&rdquo; she replied coldly but with extreme firmness, &ldquo;nothing but that  lifeless child and the picture of desolation which rose in my own mind. Do not,  I pray, make me speak again of that. It would sound like delirium, and it is my  wish to impress you with my sanity, so that you will allow me to go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall go, after the Coroner has had an opportunity to see you. We expect him  any moment. Meanwhile, you will facilitate your release and greatly help us in  what we have to do, if you will carry your fortitude to the point of showing me  in your own person just where you were standing when this young girl dashed by  you to her death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean for me to go back to that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs. Taylor. Surely you can do so if you will. When you have time to think, you  will be as anxious as ourselves to know through whose carelessness (to call it  nothing worse) this child came to her death. Though it may prove to be quite  immaterial whether you stood in one place or another at that fatal moment, it  is a question which will be sure to come up at the inquest. That you may be  able to answer correctly I urge you to return with me to the exact spot, before  your recollection of the same has had time to fade. After that we will go below  and I will see that you are taken to some quiet place where you can remain  undisturbed till the Coroner comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had  she been a weak woman she would have succumbed again at this. But she was a  strong one, and after the first moment of recoil she rose tremulously to her  feet and signified her willingness to follow him to the scene of death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is  she there alone?&rdquo; was her sole question as they crossed the corridor separating  the room they had been in from the galleries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;you  will find an officer there. We could not leave the place quite unguarded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  she shuddered he did not observe it. Having summoned up all her forces to meet  this ordeal, she followed him without further word, and re-entering the spot  she had so lately left in great agony of mind, stopped for one look and for one  look only at the sweet face of the dead girl smiling up at her from the cold  floor, then she showed Mr. Gryce as nearly as she could just where she had  paused in shock and horror when the poor child smitten by the fatal arrow fell  back almost into her arms.</p>
  <p>The  detective, with a glance at the opposite gallery, turned and spoke to the  officer who had stepped aside into the neighboring section.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  the place just occupied by this lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and hold it till you hear from  me again.&rdquo; Then offering his arm to Mrs. Taylor, he led her out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that you were approaching the railing overlooking the court when you were  stopped in this fearful manner,&rdquo; he remarked when well down the gallery toward  its lower exit. &ldquo;What did you have in mind? A nearer glimpse of the tapestry  over there and the two great vases?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no.&rdquo; She was wrought up by now to a tension almost unendurable. &ldquo;It was the  court&mdash;what I might see in the court. Oh!&rdquo; she impulsively cried: &ldquo;the child!  the child! that innocent, beautiful child!&rdquo; And breaking away from his arm, she  threw herself against the wall in a burst of uncontrollable weeping.</p>
  <p>He  allowed her a moment of unrestrained grief, then he took her on his arm again  and led her down into the court where he gave her into the charge of Correy. He  had gone as far as he dared in her present hysterical condition. Besides, he  could no longer defer the great experiment by means of which he hoped to reach  the heart of this mystery.</p>
  <p>Taking  the slip of paper handed him by Sweetwater, he crossed the court to where the  various visitors, detained, some against their will and some quite in  accordance with it, stood about in groups or sat side by side on the long  benches placed along the front for their comfort. As he confronted them, his  face beamed with that benevolent smile which had done so much for him in days  gone by. Raising his hand he called attention to himself; then, when he was  quite sure of being heard by them all, he addressed them with a quiet emphasis  which could not fail to gain and hold their attention:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Detective Gryce, sent here from Police Headquarters to look into this very  serious matter. Till the Coroner arrives, I am in authority here, and being so,  will have to ask your indulgence for any discomfort you may experience in  helping me with my investigation. A young girl, full of life an hour ago, lies  dead in the gallery above. We do not know her name; we do not know who killed  her. But there is some one here who does. The man or woman who, wittingly or  unwittingly, launched that fatal shaft, is present with us in this building.  This person has not spoken. If he will do so now, he will save us and himself,  too, no end of trouble. Let him speak, then. I will give him five minutes in  which to make this acknowledgment. Five minutes! If that man is wise&mdash;or can it  be a woman?&mdash;he will not keep us waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence.  Heads moving, eyes peering, excitement visible in every face, but not a word  from anybody. Mr. Gryce turned and pointed up at the clock. All looked&mdash;but  still no word from man or woman.</p>
  <p>One  minute gone!</p>
  <p>Two  minutes!</p>
  <p>Three!</p>
  <p>The  silence had become portentous. The movement, involuntary and simultaneous,  which had run through the crowd at first had stopped. They were waiting&mdash;each  and all&mdash;waiting with eyes on the minute-hand creeping forward over the dial  toward which the detective&rsquo;s glance was still turned.</p>
  <p>The  fourth minute passed&mdash;then the fifth&mdash;and no one had spoken.</p>
  <p>With  a sigh Mr. Gryce wheeled himself back and faced the crowd again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; he quietly announced, &ldquo;the case is serious. Twenty-two of you, and not  one to speak the half-dozen words which would release the rest from their  present embarrassing position! What remains for us to do under circumstances  like these? My experience suggests but one course: to narrow down this inquiry  to those&mdash;you will not find them many&mdash;who from their nearness to the place of  tragedy or from some other cause equally pertinent may be looked upon as  possible witnesses for the Coroner&rsquo;s jury. That this may be done speedily and  surely, I am going to ask you, every one of you, to retake the exact place in  the building which you were occupying when you heard the first alarm. I will  begin with the Curator himself. Mr. Jewett, will you be so good as to return to  the room, and if possible to the precise spot, you were occupying when you  first learned what had occurred here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Curator, who stood at his elbow, made a quick bow and turned in the direction  of the marble steps, which he hastily remounted. A murmur from the crowd  followed this action and continued till he disappeared in the recesses of the  right-hand gallery. Then, at a gesture from Mr. Gryce, it suddenly ceased, and  with a breathless interest easy to comprehend, they one and all waited for his  next word. It was a simple one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are all obliged to Mr. Jewett for his speedy compliance with so unusual a  request. He has made my task a comparatively easy one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then,  glancing at the list of names and addresses which had been compiled for him by  Sweetwater, he added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will read off your names as recorded here. If each person, on hearing his own,  will move quickly to his place and remain there till my young man can make a  note of the same, we shall get through this matter in short order. And let me  add&rdquo;&mdash;as he perceived here and there a shoulder shrugged, or an eye turned  askance&mdash;&ldquo;that once the name is called, no excuse of non-recollection will be  accepted. You must know, every one of you, just where you were standing when  the cry of death rang out, and any attempt to mislead me or others in this  matter will only subject the person making it to a suspicion he must wish to  avoid. Remember that there are enough persons here for no one to be sure that  his whereabouts at so exciting a moment escaped notice. Listen, then, and when  your own name is spoken, step quickly into place, whether that place be on this  floor or in the rooms or galleries above.&mdash;Mrs. Alice Lee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You  can imagine the flurry, the excitement and the blank looks of the average men  and women he addressed. But not one hesitated to obey. Mrs. Lee was on the  farther side of one of the statues before her name had more than left his lips.  Her example set the pace for those who followed. Like soldiers at roll-call,  each one responded to the summons, going now in one direction and now in  another until on reaching the proper spot he or she stopped.</p>
  <p>Only  six persons followed the Curator upstairs&mdash;an old woman who shook her head  violently as she plodded slowly up the marble steps; Correy; a man with a packet  of books under his arm (the same who had been studying coins in Section II); a  young couple whose movements showed such a marked reluctance that more than one  eye followed them as they went hesitatingly up, clinging together with  interlocking hands and stopping now on one step and now on another to stare at  each other in visible consternation; and a boy of fourteen who grinned from ear  to ear as he bounded gayly up three steps at a time and took his position on  the threshold of one of the upper doors with all the precision of a soldier  called to sentry-duty&mdash;a boy scout if ever there was one.</p>
  <p>There  were twenty-two names on the list, and with the calling out of the  twenty-second, Mr. Gryce perceived the space before him entirely cleared of its  odd assortment of people. As he turned to take a look at the result, a gleam of  satisfaction crossed his time-worn face. By this scheme, which he may be  pardoned for looking upon as a stroke of genius worthy of his brilliant prime,  he had set back time a full hour, restoring as by a magician&rsquo;s wand the  conditions of that fatal moment of initial alarm. Surely, with the knowledge of  that hidden bow in his mind, he should be able now to place his hand upon the  person who had made use of it to launch the fatal arrow. No one, however sly of  foot and quick of action, could have gone far from the gallery where that bow  lay in the few minutes which were all that could have elapsed between the  shooting of the arrow and the gasping cry which had brought all within hearing  to the Apache section. The man or woman whom he should find nearest to that  concealed door in the northern gallery would have to give a very good account  of himself. Not even the Curator would escape suspicion under those  circumstances.</p>
  <p>However,  it is only fair to add that Mr. Gryce had no fear of any such embarrassing end  to his inquisition as that. He had noticed the young couple who had betrayed  their alarm so ingenuously to every eye, and had already decided within himself  that the man was just such a fool as might in a moment of vacuity pick up a bow  and arrow to test his skill at a given mark. Such things had been and such  results had followed. The man was a gawk and the woman a ninny; a few questions  and their guiltiness would appear&mdash;that is, if they should be found near enough  the tapestry to warrant his suspicion. If not&mdash;the alternative held an interest  all its own, and sent him in haste toward the stairway.</p>
  <p>To  reach it Mr. Gryce had to pass several persons standing where fate had fixed  them among the statuary grouped about the court, and had his attention been  less engrossed by what he expected to discover above, he would have been deeply  interested in noting how these persons, or most of them at least, had so  thoroughly accepted the situation that they had taken the exact position and  the exact attitude of the moment preceding the alarm. Those who were admiring  the great torsos or carved chariots of the ancients, made a show of admiring  them still. The man or woman who had been going in an easterly direction, faced  east; and those who had been on the point of entering certain rooms, stood  halting in the doorways with their backs to the court.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately,  he did not take note of all this, or give the poor pawns thus parading for his  purpose more than a cursory glance. When he did think, which was when he was  halfway up the staircase, it was to look back upon a changed scene. For with  his going, interest had flagged and the tableau lost its pointedness. No one  had ventured as yet to leave his place, but all had turned their faces his way,  and on many of these faces could be seen signs of fatigue if not of absolute  impatience. He had ordered them to stand and they had stood, but to be left  there while he went above was certainly trying. The one spot which held the  interest was in the southern gallery. If they could only follow him there&mdash;</p>
  <p>All  this was to be seen in their faces, and possibly the cunning old man read it  there; but if he did, it was to ask himself if their conclusions were quite  correct. The locale of interest had shifted in the last half hour; and while  most of these people believed him to be searching for the witness who could  tell him what had occurred in the death gallery, he really was hunting for one  who could add to his knowledge of what had happened in the opposite one. And  this witness might not be found in the gallery, or even on the upper floor. It  was well among the probabilities that there might be among the various persons  he saw posing in the court below some who by an upward look might take in a  part of if not the whole broad sweep of that huge square of tapestry upon which  his thoughts were centered. It was for him to make a note of these persons. A  diagram of the court as it looked to him at that moment is shown for your  enlightenment.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="fr100135-images/page50b.png" width="800" height="143"></p>
  <p>Sixteen  persons! Ten in view from the steps and six not. Of the sixteen, only the  following seemed to afford any excuse for future interrogation: Numbers Two,  Six, Ten, Seven, Eight and Thirteen. Making a mental note of these, during  which operation the poor unfortunates who had just been considering themselves  as quite out of the game revived in a startling manner under his eye, he  proceeded on his way.</p>
  <p>As  the action has now shifted to the upper floor, a diagram of this second story  is now in order.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="fr100135-images/page52.png" width="587" height="750"></p>
  <p>As  you will see, a straight glimpse is given down either gallery from the arches  opening into the broad corridor into which Mr. Gryce had stepped on leaving the  central staircase. He had therefore only to choose which of the two would  better repay his immediate investigation.</p>
  <p>He  decided upon the northern one, which you will remember was the one holding the  tapestry; since, to find anybody there, no matter whom, would certainly settle  the identity of the person responsible for that flying arrow. For, as all  conceded, too little time had elapsed between its delivery and the discovery of  the victim for the quickest possible attempt at escape to have carried the  concealer of the bow very far from the spot where he had thrown it. It was  possible&mdash;just possible&mdash;that he might have got as far as one of the four large  rooms opening into the corridor stretching across the front, but that he was  not in the gallery itself Mr. Gryce soon convinced himself by a rapid walk  through its entire length.</p>
  <p>That  he did not follow up this move by an immediate searching of the rooms I have  mentioned was owing to a wish he had to satisfy himself on another point first.</p>
  <p>What  was this point?</p>
  <p>In  passing along the rear on his way to this gallery, he had noticed the narrow  staircase opening not a dozen feet away to his left. This undoubtedly led down  to the side-entrance. If by any chance the user of the bow had fled to the rear  instead of to the front, he would be found somewhere on this staircase, for he  never could have got to the bottom before the cry of &ldquo;Close the doors! Let no  man out!&rdquo; rendered this chance of immediate exit unavailable. So Mr. Gryce  retraced his steps, and barely stopping to note the boy eying him with eager  glances from the doorway of Room A, he approached the iron balustrade guarding  the small staircase, and cautiously looked over.</p>
  <p>A  man was there! A man going down&mdash;no, coming up; and this man, as he soon saw  from his face and uniform, was Correy the attendant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that is where <i>you</i> were,&rdquo; he called down as he beckoned the man up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  near as I can remember. I was on my way in search of Mr. Jewett, for whom I had  a message, and had got as far as you saw me, when I heard a cry of pain from  somewhere in the gallery. This naturally quickened my steps and I was up and on  this floor in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you notice, as you stepped from the landing, whether the boy staring at us from  the doorway over there was facing just as we see him now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was. I remember his attitude perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coming  out of the door&mdash;not going in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure.  He was on the run. He had heard the cry too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  followed you into the gallery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Preceded  me. He was on the scene almost as soon as the man who stepped in from the  adjoining section.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. And this man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  well within my view from the minute I entered the first arch. He seemed more  bewildered than frightened till he had passed the communicating arch and nearly  stumbled over the body of the girl shot down almost at his elbow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew by his look that something dreadful had happened, and when I saw what it  was, I didn&rsquo;t think of anything better to do than to order the doors shut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  your own initiative? Where was the Curator?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  far, it seems. But he gets awfully absorbed in whatever he is doing, and there  was no time to lose. Some one had shot that arrow, some one who might escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce never allowed himself&mdash;or very rarely&mdash;to look at anyone full and square in  the face; yet he always seemed to form an instant opinion of whomever he talked  with. Perhaps he had already gauged this man and not unfavorably, for he showed  not the slightest distrust as he remarked quite frankly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have had some suspicion of foul play even then, to act in so expeditious a  manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what my suspicions were. I simply followed my first impulse. I don&rsquo;t  think it was a bad one. Do you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Far  from it. But enough of that. Do you think&rdquo;&mdash;here he drew Correy into the gallery  out of earshot of the boy, who was watching them with all the curiosity of his  fourteen years&mdash;&ldquo;that this lad could have stolen from where we are standing now  to the door where you first saw him, during the time you were making your rush  up the stairs? Boys of his age are mighty quick, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it, sir; and I see what you mean. But even if he had been able to do  this,&mdash;which I very much doubt,&mdash;no boy of his age could have strung that bow, or  had he found it strung, have shot an arrow from it with force enough to kill.  Only a hand accustomed to its use could handle a bow like that with any  success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the bow, then? Saw it nearer than you said&mdash;possibly handled it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; but I know its kind and have handled many of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  this building?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, and in other museums where I have been. I have arranged and rearranged  Indian exhibits for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you think that the bow we saw behind the tapestry is an Indian one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective nodded and left him. One word with the boy, and he would feel free to  go elsewhere.</p>
  <p>It  proved to be an amusing one. The boy, for all his enthusiasm as a scout, proved  to be so hungry that he was actually doleful. More than that, he had a ticket  for that afternoon&rsquo;s ball game in his pocket and feared that he would not be  let out in time to see it. He therefore was quick with his answers, which  certainly were ingenuous enough. He had been looking at the model of a ship  (which could be seen through an open door), when he heard a woman cry out as if  hurt, from somewhere down the gallery. He was running to see what it meant when  a man came along who seemed in as great a hurry as himself. But he got there  first&mdash;and so on and on, corroborating Correy&rsquo;s story in every particular. He  was so honest (Mr. Gryce had been at great pains to trip him up in one of his  statements and had openly failed) and yet so anxious for the detective to  notice the ticket to the ball game which he held in one hand, that the old man  took pity on him and calling an officer, ordered him to let the boy out&mdash;a  concession to youth and innocence he was almost ready to regret when a woman of  uncertain years and irate mien attacked him from the doorway he had just left,  with the loud remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you let him go, you can let me go too. I was in this room at the same time he  was and know no more about what happened over there than the dead. I have an  appointment downtown of great importance. I shall miss it if you don&rsquo;t let me  go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it of greater importance than the right which this dead girl&rsquo;s friends have to  know by whose careless hands the arrow killing her was shot?&rdquo; And without  waiting for a reply, which was not readily forthcoming, Mr. Gryce handed her  over to Correy with an injunction to see that she was given a comfortable seat  below and proceeded to finish up this portion of the building by a search  through the three great rooms extending along the rear.</p>
  <p>He  found them all empty and without clue of any kind, and satisfied that his real  work lay in front, he returned thither with as much expedition as old age and  rheumatism would admit. Why, in doing so, he went for the third time through  the gallery instead of through rooms J, H and I, he did not stop to inquire,  though afterward he asked that question of himself more than once. Had he taken  this latter course, he might not have missed&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  that will come later. What we have to do now is to accompany him to the front  of the building, where matters of importance undoubtedly await him. He had  noted, in his previous passage to and fro, that the young man who had been  nearest to the tragedy was in his place before the case of coins in Section I.  This time he noted something more. The young man was in the selfsame spot, but  during this brief interval of waiting, the passion he evidently cherished for  numismatics had reasserted itself, and he now stood with his eyes bent as  eagerly upon the display of coins over which he hung, as if no shaft of death  had crossed the space without and no young body lay in piteous quiet beyond the  separating partition.</p>
  <p>It  was an exhibition of one of the most curious traits of human nature, and Mr.  Gryce would undoubtedly have expended a few cynical thoughts upon it if, upon  entering the broad front corridor which he had hitherto avoided, he had not run  upon Sweetwater pointing in a meaning way toward two huge cases which, stacked  with medieval arms, occupied one of the corners.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Odd  couple over there,&rdquo; he whispered as the older detective paused to listen. &ldquo;Been  watching them for the last five minutes. They pretend to be looking at some old  armor, but they are mighty uneasy and keep glancing up at the window overhead  as if they would like to jump out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce indulged in one of his characteristic exclamations. This was the couple  whose queer actions he had noticed on the staircase. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a talk with  them presently. Anyone in the rooms opposite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the Curator. He&rsquo;s in Room A, where there are a lot of engravings waiting to be  hung. I guess he was pretty well up to his neck in business when that fellow Correy  set up his shout. And have you noticed that he&rsquo;s a bit deaf, which is the  reason, perhaps, why he was not sooner on the scene?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I hadn&rsquo;t noticed. Anyone else at this end?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the young couple I speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce gave them a second look. They were by many paces farther from the  pedestal from behind which the bow had been flung back of the tapestry than  would quite fit in with the theory he had formed, and by means of which he  hoped to single out the person who had sent the deadly arrow. But then, under  the stress of fear, people can move very swiftly; and besides, what guarantee  did he have that these poor, frightened creatures had located themselves with  all the honesty the occasion demanded? According to Sweetwater there was nobody  sufficiently near to notice where they had been at the critical instant, or  where they were now. The student&rsquo;s back was toward them, and the Curator quite  out of sight behind a close-shut door.</p>
  <p>With  this doubt in his mind, Mr. Gryce started to approach the couple. As he did so,  he observed another curious fact concerning them. They were neither of them in  the place natural to people interested in the contents of the great cases which  they had crossed the hall to examine. Instead of standing where a full view of  these cases could be had, they had withdrawn so far behind them that they  presented the appearance of persons in hiding. Yet as he drew nearer and noted  their youth and countrified appearance, Mr. Gryce was careful to assume his  most benign deportment and so to modulate his voice as to call up the pink into  the young woman&rsquo;s cheek and the deep red into the man&rsquo;s. What Mr. Gryce said  was this: &ldquo;You are interested I see in this show of old armor? I don&rsquo;t wonder.  It is very curious. Is this your first visit to the museum?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man nodded; the woman lowered her head. Both were self-conscious to a point  painful to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a pity your first visit should be spoiled by anything so dreadful as the  accidental death of this young girl. It seems to have frightened you both very  much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes,&rdquo; muttered the man. &ldquo;We never saw anybody hurt before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know the young lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no; oh, no!&rdquo; they both hastened to cry out in a confused jumble, after which  the man added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re  from up the river. We don&rsquo;t know anybody in this big town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke, he began to edge away from the wall, the girl following.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  smiled the detective. &ldquo;You are getting out of place. You were looking at the  armor when you first heard the hubbub over there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both  were silent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  were you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was looking at her, and her was looking at me,&rdquo; stammered the man. &ldquo;We  were&mdash;were talking together here&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t notice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  married, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday  noon, sir. How&mdash;how did you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know; I only guessed. And I think I can guess something else&mdash;what your  reason was for stealing into this dark corner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the man who now looked down, and the woman who looked up. In a pinch of  this kind, it is the woman who is the more courageous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was a-kissin&rsquo; of me, sir,&rdquo; she whispered in a frank but shamefaced way. &ldquo;There  was no harm in that, was there? We&rsquo;re so fond of one another, and how could we  know that anyone was dying so near?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  there was no harm,&rdquo; Mr. Gryce reluctantly admitted. Caught in an absurdity  amusing enough in its way, he would certainly under less strenuous  circumstances have rather enjoyed his own humiliation. But the occasion was too  serious and his part in it too pronounced for him to take any pleasure in this  misadventure. In the prosecution of so daring a scheme for locating witnesses  if not of discovering the actual user of the bow, it would not do to fail. He <i>must</i> find the man he sought. If the Curator&mdash;but one glance into the room where that  gentleman stood amid a litter of prints satisfied him that Sweetwater was right  as to the impossibility of getting any information from this quarter. Nor could  he hope, remembering what he had himself seen, that he would succeed any better  with the last person now remaining on this floor&mdash;the young man busy with the coins  in No. I.</p>
  <p>That  he was to be so fortunate as to lay an immediate hand on the person who had  shot the fatal arrow was no longer regarded by him as among the possibilities.  Whoever this person was, he had found a way of escape which rendered him for  the time being safe from discovery. But there was another possible  miscalculation which he felt it his duty to recognize before he proceeded  further in his difficult task. The bow found back of the tapestry had every  appearance of being the one used for the delivery of the arrow. But was it?  Might it not, in some strange and unaccountable way, have been flung there  previous to the present event and by some hand no longer in the building? Such  coincidences have been known, and while as a rule this old and experienced  detective put little confidence in coincidences of any kind, he had but one  thought in mind in approaching this final witness, which was to get from him  some acknowledgment of having seen, on or about the time of the accident, a  movement in the tapestry behind which this bow lay concealed. If once this fact  could be established, there could be no further question as to the direct  connection between the bow there found and the present crime.</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Gryce might have spared his pains, so far as this young man was concerned.  He had been so engrossed in his search for a particularly rare coin, that he  had had no eyes for anything beyond. Besides, he was abnormally nearsighted,  not being able, even with his glasses, to distinguish faces at any distance, much  less a movement in a piece of tapestry.</p>
  <p>All  of this was discouraging, even if anticipated; but there were still the people  below, some one of whom might have seen what this man had not. He would go down  to them now, but by a course which would incidentally enlighten him in regard  to another matter about which he had some doubts.</p>
  <p>In  his goings to and fro through the hall, he had passed the open door of Room H  and noted how easily a direct flight could be made through it and Rooms I and J  to the small staircase running down at the rear. Whether or not this explained  the absence of anyone on this floor who by the utmost stretch of imagination  could be held responsible for the accident which had occurred there, he felt it  incumbent upon him to see in how short a time the escape he still believed in  could be made through these rooms.</p>
  <p>Timing  his steps from the pedestal nearest this end, he found that even at his slow  pace it took but three minutes for him to reach the arcade leading into the  court from the foot of the staircase. A man conscious of wrong and eager to  escape would do it in less; and if, as possibly happened, he had to wait in the  doorway of Room J till Correy and the boy had cleared the way for him by their  joint run into the farther gallery, he would still have time to be well on his  way to the lower floor before the cry went up which shut off all further  egress. Relieved, if not contented with the prospect this gave of a new clue to  his problem, he re&euml;ntered the court and was preparing to renew his  investigations when the arrival of the Coroner put a temporary end to his  efforts as well as to the impatience of the so-called pawns, who were now  allowed, one and all, to leave their posts.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="V"></a><b>V<br>
    Three Where Two Should Be</b></h2>
  <p>It  was a good half-hour before Mr. Gryce again found himself in a position to  pursue the line of investigation thus summarily interrupted. The condition of  Mrs. Taylor, which had not been improved by delay, demanded attention, and it  was with a sense of great relief that Mr. Gryce finally saw her put into a  taxi. Her hurried examination by Coroner Price had elicited nothing new, and of  all who had noticed her distraught air on leaving the building, there was not  one, if we except the detective, but felt convinced that if she had not been of  unsound mind previous to this accident, she certainly had become so since. He  still held to his theory that her story, fantastic and out of character as it  seemed, was true in all its essentials, and that it was the warning she  believed herself to have received of her husband&rsquo;s death, rather than what had  taken place under her eyes, which had caused her such extreme suffering and  temporarily laid her reason low.</p>
  <p>With  the full approbation of the Coroner, to whom he had explained his idea, Mr.  Gryce began the sifting process by which he hoped to discover the one witness  he wanted.</p>
  <p>To  subject to further durance such persons as from their position at the moment of  tragedy could have no information to give bearing in any way upon their  investigation was manifestly unfair. The old woman who had been found in Room A  was of this class, and accordingly was allowed to go, together with such others  as had been within twenty feet or more of the main entrance. These eliminated  (it was curious to see how loath these few chosen ones were to depart, now that  the opportunity was given them), Mr. Gryce settled down to business by asking  Mrs. Lynch to come forward.</p>
  <p>She,  as you will see by consulting the chart, answered to the person marked &ldquo;2.&rdquo; A  little, dried-up, eager woman rose from the bench on which were collected the  few people still remaining, and met his inquiring look with a nervous smile.  She, of all the persons moving about on the main floor at the moment of alarm,  had been in the best position for seeing the flight of the arrow and the fall  of the victim in Section II. Had she seen them? The continued jigging of the  small, wiry curls hanging out from either side of her old-fashioned bonnet  would seem to betray an inner perturbation indicative of some hitherto suppressed  information. At all events Mr. Gryce allowed himself this hope and was most  bland and encouraging in his manner as he showed her the place which had been  assigned her on the chart drawn up by Sweetwater, and asked if the position  given her was correct.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  a ready reply was too much to expect&mdash;women of her stamp not knowing, as a rule,  very much about charts. But when he saw her hasten to the very spot assigned  her by Sweetwater, he took heart and with a suggestive glance at the gallery  intimated that he would be very glad to hear what she had seen there. Her  surprise was evident, much too evident for his satisfaction. The little curls  jigged about more than ever, and her cheeks grew quite pink as she answered  hastily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t see anything. I wasn&rsquo;t looking. Did you think I saw anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hoped you had,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;If your eyes had chanced to be turned toward that  end of the gallery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I was going the other way. My back was to it, not my face&mdash;like this.&rdquo; And  wheeling herself about, she showed him that she had been walking toward the  rear of the building rather than advancing toward the front.</p>
  <p>His  disappointment was great; but it would have been greater if he had not realized  that under these conditions she was in the precise position to meet face to  face any person emerging into the court from the foot of the small staircase.  If she could tell him of having seen any such person, and closely enough to be  able to give a description of this person&rsquo;s appearance, then she might prove to  be his prime witness, after all. But she could not satisfy him on this point.  She had been on her way out, and was too busy searching in her bag for her  umbrella check to notice whether there were people about her or not. She had  not found it when the great shout came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oh,  then she was so frightened and so shocked that everything swam before her eyes  and she nearly fell! Her heart was not a strong one and sometimes missed a beat  or two, and she thought it must have done so then, for when her head steadied  again, she found herself clinging to the balustrade of the great staircase.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you have nothing whatever to add to what the others have told?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  &ldquo;no,&rdquo; if a shaky one, was decisive, and seeing no reason for detaining her  further, he gave her permission to depart.</p>
  <p>Disturbed  in his calculations, but not disheartened, Mr. Gryce next proceeded to  interrogate the door-man at this end of the building. From his position, facing  as he did the approach from the small staircase, he should be able to say, if  the old lady could not, whether anyone had crossed the open strip of court  toward which she had been advancing. But Mr. Gryce found him no more  clear-headed on this point than she. He was the oldest man connected with the  museum, and had been very much shaken up by what had occurred. Really, he could  not say whether anyone had passed across his line of vision at that time or  not. All he could be sure of was that no attempt had been made by anyone to  reach the door after he had been bidden to close it.</p>
  <p>So  this clue ended like the rest in no thoroughfare. Would he have any better luck  with the subject of his next inquiry? The young lady tabulated as No. 13 was  where she could have seen the upper edge of the tapestry shake if she had been  looking that way; but she was not. She also was going from instead of toward  the point of interest&mdash;in other words, entering and not leaving the room on  whose threshold she stood.</p>
  <p>Only  two men were left from whom he could hope to obtain the important testimony he  was so anxiously seeking: Nos. 10 and 11. He had turned back toward the bench  where they should be awaiting his attention and was debating whether he would  gain more by attacking them singly or together, when he suddenly became aware  of a fact which drove all these small considerations out of his mind.</p>
  <p>According  to every calculation and according to the chart, there should be only these two  men on that bench. But he saw <i>three</i>. Who was this third man, and where  had he come from?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="VI"></a><b>VI<br>
    The Man In The Gallery</b></h2>
  <p>Beckoning  to Sweetwater, Mr. Gryce pointed out this extra man and asked him if he  recognized him as one of the twenty-two he had tabulated.</p>
  <p>The  answer was a vigorous no. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new face to me. He must have dropped from the  roof or come up through the flooring. He certainly wasn&rsquo;t anywhere about when I  made out my list. He looks a trifle hipped, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Troubled&mdash;decidedly  troubled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might go a little further and say done up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-looking,  though. Appears to be of foreign birth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;English,  I should say, and just over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;English,  without a doubt. I&rsquo;ll go speak to him; you wait here, but watch out for the  Coroner, and send him my way as soon as he&rsquo;s at leisure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  he reapproached the bench, and observing, with the keenness with which he  observed everything without a direct look, that with each step he took the  stranger&rsquo;s confusion increased, he decided to wait till after he had finished  with the others, before he entered upon an inquiry which might prove not only  lengthy but of the first importance.</p>
  <p>He  was soon very glad that he had done this. He got nothing from Mr. Simpson; but  the questions put to Mr. Turnbull were more productive. Almost at the first  word, this gentleman acknowledged that he had seen a movement in the great  square of tapestry to which Mr. Gryce drew his attention. He did not know when,  or just where he stood at the time, but he certainly had noticed it shake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you describe the movement?&rdquo; asked the gratified detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  swayed out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if blown by some wind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  more as if pushed forward by a steady hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  And what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  settled back almost without a quiver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Instantly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not instantly. A moment or two passed before it fell back into place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  was before the attendant Correy called out his alarm, of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yes,  of course it was before; but how long before, he couldn&rsquo;t say. A minute&mdash;two  minutes&mdash;five minutes&mdash;how could he tell! He had no watch in hand.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce thought possibly he might assist the man&rsquo;s memory on this point but  forbore to do so at the time. It was enough for his present purpose that the  necessary link to the establishment of his theory had been found. No more doubt  now that the bow lying in the niche of the doorway overhead had been the one  made use of in this desperate tragedy; and the way thus cleared for him, he could  confidently proceed in his search for the man who had flung it there. He  believed him to be within his reach at that very moment, but his countenance  gave no index to his thought as reapproaching the young man now sitting all  alone on the bench, he halted before him and pleasantly inquired:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I see you for the first time? I thought we had listed the name of every person  in the building. How is it that we did not get yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  tide of color which instantly flooded the young man&rsquo;s countenance astonished  Mr. Gryce both by its warmth and fullness. If he were as thin-skinned as this  betokened, one should experience but little difficulty in reaching the heart of  his trouble.</p>
  <p>With  an air of quiet interest Mr. Gryce sat down by the young man&rsquo;s side. Would this  display of friendliness have the effect of restoring some of his  self-possession and giving him the confidence he evidently lacked? No, the red  fled from his cheek, and a ghastly white took its place; but he showed no other  change.</p>
  <p>Meantime  the detective studied his countenance. It was a good one, but just now so  distorted by suffering that only such as were familiar with his every look  could read his character from his present expression. Would a more direct  question rouse him? Possibly. At all events, Mr. Gryce decided to make the  experiment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you give me your name?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;&mdash;your name and residence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man he addressed gave a quick start, pulled himself together and made an  attempt to reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name is Travis. I am an Englishman just off the steamer from Southampton. My  home is in the county of Hertfordshire. I have no residence here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  hotel, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  flush&mdash;then quickly: &ldquo;I have not yet chosen one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was too surprising for belief. A stranger in town without rooms or hotel accommodations,  making use of the morning hours to visit a museum!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must be very much interested in art!&rdquo; observed his inquisitor a little dryly.</p>
  <p>Again  that flush and again the quick-recurring pallor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  am interested in all things beautiful,&rdquo; he replied at last in broken tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. May I ask where you were when that arrow flew which killed a young lady  visitor? Not in this part of the court, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Travis gave a quick shudder and that was all. The detective waited, but no  other answer came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am told that as she fell she uttered one cry. Did you hear it, Mr. Travis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t a cry,&rdquo; was his quick reply. &ldquo;It was something quite different, but  dreadful, dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce&rsquo;s manner changed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you did hear it. You were near enough to distinguish between a scream and a  gasp. Where were you, and why weren&rsquo;t you seen by my man when he went through  the building?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  was kneeling out of sight&mdash;too shocked to move. But I grew tired of that and  wanted to go; but on reaching the court, I found the doors closed. So I came  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kneeling!  Where were you kneeling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  made a quick gesture in the direction of the galleries.</p>
  <p>The  detective frowned, perhaps to hide his secret satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  you be a little more definite?&rdquo; he asked; then as the man continued to hesitate  he added, but as yet without any appreciable loss of kindliness: &ldquo;Every other  person here has been good enough to show us the exact place he was occupying at  that serious moment. I must ask you to do the same; it is only just.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  the look this called up one of fear or of simple repugnance? It might be  either; but the detective was disposed to consider it fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you lead the way?&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;I shall be glad to follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  glance of extreme reproach; then these words, uttered with painful intensity:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want me to go back there&mdash;where I saw&mdash;where I can see again&mdash;<i>I cannot</i>. I&rsquo;m  not well. I suffer. You will excuse me. You will allow me to say what I have to  say, <i>here</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry, but I cannot do that. The others have gone without question to their  places; why should not you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo;  The word came brokenly and was followed by silence. Then, seeing the  hopelessness of contending with police authority, he cast another glance of  strong repulsion in the direction of the gallery and started to his feet. Mr.  Gryce did the same, and together they crossed the court. But they got no  further at this time than the foot of the staircase. Coroner Price, by an extra  effort which seemed to be called for by the circumstances, had succeeded in picking  up a jury from the people collected on the street, and entering at this moment,  created a diversion which effectively postponed the detective&rsquo;s examination of  his new witness.</p>
  <p>When  the opportunity came for resuming it, so much time had elapsed that Mr. Gryce  looked for some decided change in the manner or bearing of the man who,  unfortunately for his purposes, had thus been given a quiet hour in which to  think. Better, much better, for the cause of justice, if he could have pushed  him to the point at once, harried him, as it were, in hot blood. Now he might  find him more difficult.</p>
  <p>But  when, in company with the Coroner, who now found himself free to assist him in  his hunt for witnesses, he reapproached the Englishman sitting as before alone  on his bench, it was to find him to all appearance in the same mind in which he  had left him. He wore the same look and followed with the same reluctance when  he was made to understand that the time had now come for him to show just where  he was standing when that arrow was sped on its death-course. And greatly  impressed by this fact, which in a way contradicted all his expectations, Mr.  Gryce trod slowly after, watching with the keenest interest to see whether, on  reaching the top of the steps, this man upon whose testimony so much depended  would turn toward the southern gallery where the girl had fallen, or toward the  northern one, where Correy had found the bow.</p>
  <p>It  looked as if he were going to the left, for his head turned that way as he  cleared the final step. But his body soon swayed aside in the other direction,  and by the time the old detective had himself reached the landing, Travis,  closely accompanied by the Coroner, had passed through the first of the three  arches leading to that especial section of the gallery where the concealing  tapestry hung.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man is honest,&rdquo; was Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s first thought. &ldquo;He is going to show us the bow  and confess to what was undoubtedly an accident.&rdquo; But Mr. Gryce felt more or  less ready to modify this impromptu conclusion when, on passing through the  arch himself he came upon the young man still standing in Section VI, with his  eyes on the opposite gallery and his whole frame trembling with emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she&mdash;the young lady who was shot&mdash;still lying on those cold stones alone, forsaken  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce knew misery when he saw it. This man had not overstated the case when he  had said &ldquo;I suffer.&rdquo; But the cause! To what could this excess of sensibility be  attributed? To remorse or to an exaggerated personal repulsion? It looked like  remorse, but that there might be no doubt as to this, Mr. Gryce hastened to  assure the Englishman that on the departure of the jury the body had been  removed to one of the inner rooms. The relief which this gave to Mr. Travis was  evident. He showed no further reluctance to proceed and was indeed the first of  the three to enter where the great drapery hung, flanked by the two immense  vases. Would he pause before it or hurry by into the broad corridor in front?  If he hurried by, what would become of their now secretly accepted theory?</p>
  <p>But  he did not hurry by; that is, he did not pass beyond the upper end, but stopped  when he got there and looked back with an air of extreme deprecation at the two  officials.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  we arrived?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gryce, his suspicions all returning, for the man had  stepped aside from the drapery and was standing in a spot conspicuously open to  view even from the lower court.</p>
  <p>The  Englishman nodded; whereupon Mr. Gryce, approaching to his side, exclaimed in  evident doubt:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were standing <i>here</i>? When? Not at the moment the young girl fell, or you  would have been seen by some one, if not by everyone, in the building. I want  you to take the exact place you occupied when you first learned that something  had gone wrong in the opposite gallery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  stranger&rsquo;s distress grew. With a show of indecision scarcely calculated to  inspire confidence in either of the two men watching him, he moved now here and  now there till he finally came to a standstill close by the pedestal&mdash;so close,  indeed, to its inner corner that he was almost in a line with its rear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was here,&rdquo; he declared with a gulp of real feeling. &ldquo;I am sure I am right now.  I had just stepped out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  behind the tapestry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  His blank astonishment at the quickness with which he had been caught up left  him staring for a moment at the speaker, before he added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  behind the pedestal. The&mdash;the vase, as you see, is a very curious one. I wanted  to look at it from all sides.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  a word the Coroner slipped past him and entering the narrow space behind the  pedestal took a look up at the vase from his present cramped position.</p>
  <p>As  he did this, two things happened: first Sweetwater, who had stolen upon the  scene, possibly at some intimation from Mr. Gryce, took a step toward them  which brought him in alignment with the Englishman, of whose height in  comparison with his own he seemed to take careful note; and secondly, the  sensitive skin of the foreigner flushed red again as he noticed the Coroner&rsquo;s  sarcastic smile, and heard his dry remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  gets a better view here of the opposite gallery than of the vase perched so  high overhead. Had you wished to look at those ladies, without being seen by  them, you could hardly have found a better loophole than the one made by the  curving in of this great vase toward its base.&rdquo; Then quickly: &ldquo;You surely took  one look their way; that would be only natural.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer Mr. Travis gave was certainly unexpected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was after I came out that I saw them,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;There were two ladies,  one tall and one very young and slight. The older lady was stepping toward the  front, the other entering from behind. As I looked, the younger made a dash and  ran by the first lady. Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proceed,  Mr. Travis. Your emotion is very natural; but it is imperative that we hear all  you have to tell us. She ran by the older lady, and then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  silence. The Englishman appeared to be looking at Coroner Price, who in  speaking emerged from behind the pedestal; but it is doubtful if he saw him. A  tear was in his eye&mdash;a tear!</p>
  <p>Seeing  it, Mr. Gryce felt a movement of compassion, and thinking to help him, said  kindly enough:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it so very dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer came with great simplicity:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  One minute she was all life and gaiety; the next she was lying outstretched on  the hard floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  that look of ingenuous surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t remember about myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was thinking too much about her. I  never saw anyone killed before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Killed?  Why do you say killed? You say you saw her fall, but how did you know she was  killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw the arrow in her breast. As she fell backward, I saw the arrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he uttered these words, the three men watching him perceived the sweat start  out on his forehead, and his eyes take on a glassy stare. It was as if he were  again in gaze upon that image of youthful loveliness falling to the ground with  the arrow of death in her heart. The effect was strangely moving. To see this  event reflected as it were in horror from this man&rsquo;s consciousness made it  appear more real and much more impressive than when contemplated directly. Why?  Had remorse given it its poignancy? Had it been his own hand which had directed  this arrow from behind the pedestal? If not, why this ghastly display of an  emotion so far beyond what might be expected from the most sentimental of  onlookers?</p>
  <p>In  an endeavor to clear the situation, the Coroner intervened with the following  question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever seen a shot made by a bow and arrow before, Mr. Travis?  Archery-practice, I mean. Or&mdash;well, the shooting of wild animals in India,  Africa or elsewhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. I come from a country where the bow and arrow are used. But I never shoot.  I can only speak of what I have seen others do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is sufficient. You ought to be able to tell, then, from what direction this  arrow came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it  must have come from this side of the gallery. Not from this section, as you  call it, but from some one of the other open places along here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not from this one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  there was nobody here but me,&rdquo; was the simple and seemingly ingenuous answer.</p>
  <p>It  gave them an unexpected surprise. Innocence would speak in this fashion. But  then the bow&mdash;the bow which was lying not a dozen feet from where they stood!  Nothing could eliminate that bow.</p>
  <p>After  a short consultation between themselves, which the Englishman seemed not to  notice, the Coroner addressed him with the soothing remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Travis, you must not misunderstand me. The accident which has occurred (we will  not yet say crime) is of so serious a nature that it is imperative for us to  get at the exact facts. Only yourself and one other person whom we know can  supply them. I allude to the lady you saw, first in front of and then behind  the girl who was shot. Her story has been told. Yours will doubtless coincide  with it. May I ask you, then, to satisfy us on a point you were in a better  position than herself to take note of. It is this: When the young girl gave  that bound forward of which you both speak, did she make straight for the  railing in front, or did she approach it in a diagonal direction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know. You distress me very much. I was not thinking of anything like  that. Why should I think of anything so immaterial. She came&mdash;I saw her smiling,  beaming with joy, a picture of lovely youth&mdash;then her arms went suddenly up and  she fell&mdash;backward&mdash;the arrow showing in her breast. If I told the story a  hundred times, I could not tell it differently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  do not wish you to, Mr. Travis. Only there must be somewhere in your mind a  recollection of the angle which her body presented to the railing as she came  forward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  unhappy man shook his head, at which token of helplessness Mr. Gryce beckoned  to Sweetwater and whispered a few words in his ear. The man nodded and  withdrew, going the length of the gallery, where he disappeared among the  arches, to reappear shortly after in the gallery opposite. When he reached  Section II, Mr. Gryce again addressed the witness, who, to his surprise and to  that of the Coroner as well, had become reabsorbed in his own thoughts to the  entire disregard of what this movement might portend. It took a sharp word to  rouse him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to ask you to watch the young man who has just shown himself on the  other side, and tell us to what extent his movements agree with those made by  the young lady prior to her collapse and fall to the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  an instant indignation robbed the stranger of all utterance. Then he burst  forth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would make a farce of what is so sad and dreadful, and she scarcely cold! It is  dishonoring to the young lady. I cannot look at that young man&mdash;that hideous  young man&mdash;and think of her and of how she looked and walked the instant before  her death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two officials smiled; they could not help it. Sweetwater was certainly no  beauty, and to associate him in any kind of physical comparison with the dead  girl was certainly incongruous. Yet they both felt that the point just advanced  by them should be settled and settled now while the requisite remembrance was  fresh in the mind of this invaluable witness. But in order to get at what they  wanted, some show of consideration for his feelings was evidently necessary.  Police persistence often defeats its own ends. If he was to be made to do what  they wished, it would have to be through the persuasion of some one outside the  Force. To whom should they appeal? The question answered itself. Mr. Roberts  was approaching from the front, and to him they turned. Would he use his  influence with this stranger?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may listen to you,&rdquo; urged the Coroner in the whispered conference which now  followed, &ldquo;if you explain to him how much patience you and all the rest of the  people in the building have had to exercise in this unhappy crisis. He seems a  good enough fellow, but not in line with our ideas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Roberts, who saw the man for the first time, surveyed him in astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was he standing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  where you see him now&mdash;or so he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  couldn&rsquo;t have been. Some one would have observed him&mdash;the woman who was in the  compartment with the stricken girl, or the man studying coins in the one next  to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it would seem,&rdquo; admitted the Coroner. &ldquo;But if he were behind the pedestal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behind  the pedestal!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  where we think he was. But no matter about that now!&mdash;we can explain that to you  later. At present all we want is for you to reassure him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  altogether pleased with his task, but seeing no good reason for declining it,  the affable director approached the Englishman, who, recognizing one of his own  social status, seemed to take heart and turn a willing ear to Mr. Roberts&rsquo;  persuasions. The result was satisfactory.</p>
  <p>When  the Coroner again called Mr. Travis&rsquo; attention to Sweetwater awaiting orders in  the opposite gallery he did not refuse to look, though his whole manner showed  how much he was affected by this forced acquiescence in their plans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will watch the movements of the young man we have placed over there,&rdquo; the  Coroner had said; &ldquo;and when he strikes a position corresponding to that taken  by the young lady at the moment she was shot, lift up your hand, thus. I will  not ask you to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you forget that there is blood on that floor. That man will step in it. I  cannot lend myself to such sacrilege. It is wrong. Let the lady be buried  first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  outburst was so natural, the horror so unfeigned, that not only the men he  addressed but all within hearing showed the astonishment it caused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  would think you knew the victim of this random shot!&rdquo; the Coroner intimated  with a fresh and close scrutiny of this very reluctant witness. &ldquo;Did you? Was  she a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; came in quick disavowal. &ldquo;No friend. I have never exchanged a word with  her&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we will proceed. One cannot consider sensibilities in a case like this.&rdquo; And he  made a signal to Sweetwater, who turned his body this way and that.</p>
  <p>The  distressed Englishman watched these movements with slowly dilating eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the angle we want&mdash;the angle at which she presented her body to the gallery  front,&rdquo; explained the relentless official.</p>
  <p>A  shudder, then the rigidity of fixed attention, broken in another moment,  however, by an impulsive movement and the unexpected question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it to find the man who did it that you are enacting this horrible farce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somewhat  startled, the Coroner retorted:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you object on that account&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Travis as vehemently exclaimed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t! I want the man caught. One should not shoot arrows about in a place  where there are beautiful young women. I want him caught and punished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  they were all digesting this unexpected avowal, they saw his hand go up. The  Coroner gave a low whistle, and the detective in obedience to it stood for one  instant stock-still&mdash;then bent quickly to the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is he doing?&rdquo; cried Mr. Travis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  what is he doing?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Roberts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Running  a mark about his shoes to fix their exact location,&rdquo; was the grim response.</p>

  &ldquo;You Think That Of Me!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  certainly up against it this time,&rdquo; were the words with which Dr. Price led the  detective down the gallery. &ldquo;What sort of an opinion can a man form of a fellow  like that? Is he fool or knave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce showed no great alacrity in answering. When he did speak it was to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  shall have to go into the matter a little more deeply before we can trust our  judgment as to his complete sincerity. But if you want to know whether I  believe him to have loosed the arrow which killed that innocent child, I am  ready from present appearances to say yes. Who else was there to do it? He and  he only was on the spot. But it was a chance action, without intention or wish  to murder. No man, even if he were a fool, would choose such a place or such a means  for murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true; but how does it help to call it accident? Accident calls for a bow in  hand, an arrow within reach, an impulse to try one&rsquo;s skill at a fancied target.  Now the arrow&mdash;whatever may be said of the bow&mdash;was not within the reach of  anyone standing in this gallery. The arrow came from the wall at the base of  which this young woman died. It had to be brought from there here. That does  not look like accident, but crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yet  as the Coroner uttered this acknowledgment, he realized as plainly as Mr. Gryce  how many incongruous elements lay in the way of any such solution of the  mystery. If they accepted the foreigner&rsquo;s account of himself,&mdash;which for some  reason neither seemed ready to dispute,&mdash;into what a maze of improbabilities it  at once led them! A stranger just off ship! The victim a mere schoolgirl! The  weapon such an unusual one as to be <i>outr&eacute;</i> beyond belief. Only a  madman&mdash;But there! Travis had less the appearance of a lunatic than Mrs. Taylor.  It must have been an accident as Gryce said; and yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>If  there is much virtue in an <i>if</i>, there is certainly a modicum of the same  in a <i>yet</i>, and the Coroner, in full recognition of this stumbling-block,  remarked with unusual dryness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you that some half-dozen questions are necessary before we wade  deeper into this quagmire. Where shall we go to have it out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Curator will allow us to use his office. I will see that Mr. Travis joins us  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  that he comes before he has a chance to fall into one of his reveries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  quickly as Mr. Gryce worked, he was not speedy enough to prevent the result  mentioned. The man upon whose testimony so much hinged did not even lift his  eyes when brought again into their presence.</p>
  <p>The  Coroner, in his determination to be satisfied on this point, made short work of  rousing him from his abstraction. With a few leading questions he secured his  attention and then without preamble or apology asked him with what purpose he  had come to America and why he had been so anxious to visit the museum that he  hastened directly to it from the steamer without making an effort to locate  himself in some hotel.</p>
  <p>The  ease with which this apparently ingenuous stranger had managed to meet the  opening queries of this rough-and-ready official was suddenly broken. He  stammered and turned red and made so many abortive attempts to reply that the  latter grew impatient and finally remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the truth will incriminate you, you are quite justified in holding it back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Incriminate  me!&rdquo; With the repetition of this alarming word, a change of the most marked  character took place in young Travis&rsquo; manner. &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I  am not sure that I understand your use of that word <i>incriminate</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Price explained himself, to the seeming horror of the startled Englishman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think that of me!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;of me, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here indignation made him speechless, till some feeling stronger than the one  subduing him to silence forced him again into speech, and he supplemented in  broken tones: &ldquo;I am only a stranger to you and consequently am willing to  pardon your misconception of my character and the principles by which I  regulate my life. I have a horror of crime and all violence; besides, the young  lady&mdash;she awakened my deepest admiration and reverence. I,&rdquo;&mdash;again he stopped;  again he burst forth,&mdash;&ldquo;I would sooner have died myself than seen such angel  graces laid low. Let my emotion be proof of what I say. It was a man of the  hardest heart who killed her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would seem so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the Coroner who spoke. He was nonplussed; and Mr. Gryce no less so. Never  had either of them been confronted by a blinder or more bewildering case. An  incomprehensible crime and a suspect it was impossible to associate with a deed  of blood! There must be some other explanation of the mournful circumstance they  were considering. There had been twenty or more people in the building, but&mdash;and  here was the rub&mdash;if the chart which they had drawn up was correct and the  calculations which they had drawn from it were to be depended upon, this man  was the only person who had been in this gallery when the arrow was shot.</p>
  <p>With  a side glance at Mr. Gryce, who seemed content to remain silent in the  background, Dr. Price turned again to Mr. Travis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  admiration of the young lady must have been as sudden as it was strong. Or  possibly you had seen her before you hid behind the pedestal. Had you, Mr.  Travis? She was a charming child; perhaps you had been attracted by her beauty  before you even entered the galleries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly  the man was another being.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right,&rdquo; he acquiesced with undue alacrity. &ldquo;I had seen her crossing the  court. Her beauty was heavenly. I am a gentleman, but I followed her. When she  moved, I moved; and when she went upstairs, I followed her. But I would not  offend. I kept behind,&mdash;far behind her,&mdash;and when she entered the gallery on one  side, I took pains to enter it on the other. This is how I came to be looking  in her direction when she was struck down. You see, I speak with candor; I open  my whole heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Price, stroking his long beard, eyed the man with a thoughtful air which  changed to one of renewed inquiry. Instead of being convinced by this outburst,  he was conscious of a new and deepening distrust. The transition from a low  state of feeling to one so feverishly eager had been too sudden. The avidity  with which this man just off ship had made a grasp at the offered explanation  had been too marked; it lacked sincerity and could impose on no one. Of this he  seemed himself aware, for again the ready flush ran from forehead to neck, and  with a deprecatory glance which included the silent detective he vehemently  exclaimed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am poor at a lie. I see that you will have the whole truth. It was on her  account I crossed the ocean. It was by dogging her innocent steps that I came  to the museum this morning. I am a man of means, and I can do as I please. When  I said that I had never exchanged a word with her, I spoke the truth. I never  have; yet my interest in her was profound. I have never seen any other girl or  woman whom I was anxious to make my wife. I hoped to meet and woo her in this  country. I had no opportunity for doing so in my own. I did not see her till a  night or so before she sailed, and then it was at the theater, where she sat  with some friends in an adjoining box. She talked, and I heard what she said.  She was leaving England. She was going to America to live; and she mentioned  the steamer on which she expected to sail. It may strike you as impetuous,  unnatural in an Englishman, and all that, but next morning I secured my passage  on that same ship. As I have just said, I am my own master and can do as I  please, and I pleased to do that. But for all the opportunity which a voyage  sometimes gives, I did not succeed in making her acquaintance on shipboard,  much as I desired it. I was ill for the first three days and timorous the rest.  I could only watch her moving about the decks and wait for the happy moment in  which I might be able to do her some service. But that moment never came, and  now it never will come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  mournfulness with which this was uttered seemed genuine. The Coroner was  silenced by it, and it was left to Mr. Gryce to take up the conversation. This  he did with the same show of respect evinced by Dr. Price.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are obliged to you for your confidence,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Of course you can tell us  this young girl&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Angeline&mdash;Angeline  Willetts. I saw it in the list of passengers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  ship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The <i>Castania</i>, from Southampton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are greatly obliged to you for this information. It gives us the much-wanted  clue to her identity. Angeline Willetts! Whom was she with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Madame Duclos, a French lady. I once spoke to <i>her</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did? And what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  bade her good morning as we were passing on the main-deck stairs. But she did  not answer, and I was not guilty of the impertinence again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. Such, then, was the situation up to this morning. But since? How did it  happen that a young girl, six hours after landing in this country, should come  to a place like this without a chaperon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what brought her here; I can only tell you why I came. When she left  the dock, I was standing near enough to hear the orders Madame Duclos gave on  entering a cab. Naturally, mine were the same. I have been in New York before,  and I knew the hotel. If you will consult the Universal&rsquo;s register for the day,  you will find my name in it under hers. You will understand why I shrank from  confessing to this fact before. I held her in such honor&mdash;I was and am so  anxious that no shadow should fall upon her innocence from my poor story of  secret and unrecognized devotion. She knew nothing of what led me to follow  every step she took. I was a witness of her fate, but that is all the  connection between us. I hope you believe me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  would be difficult not to, in face of his direct gaze, from which all faltering  had now vanished. Yet the matter not being completely thrashed out, Mr. Gryce  felt himself obliged to say in answer to this last:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  see no reason to doubt your word or your story, Mr. Travis. All that you have  said is possible. But how about your following the young girl here? How did  that come about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was occasioned by my anxiety for her&mdash;an anxiety which seems to have been only  too well-founded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?  What?&rdquo; Both of the officials showed a greatly increased interest. &ldquo;Please  explain yourself, Mr. Travis. What reason had you for any such feeling in  regard to a person with whom you had held no conversation? Anything which you  saw or heard at the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I was sitting in the foyer. I knew that the ladies were in the house, but I had  not seen them. I was anxious to do so (see, I am telling all) and was watching  the door of the lift from behind my journal, when they both stepped out. Miss  Willetts was dressed for the street, but Madame Duclos was not, which seemed  very strange to me. But I felt no concern till I caught some fragments of what  Madame said in passing me. She spoke in French, a language I understand, and  she was exclaiming over her misfortune at not being allowed to accompany her  young charge to whatever place she was going. It was bad, bad, she cried, and  she would not have a moment&rsquo;s peace till her dear Angeline got back. Anxiety of  this kind was natural in a Frenchwoman not accustomed to see a young lady enter  the streets alone; but the force with which she expressed it betrayed a real  alarm&mdash;an alarm which communicated itself to me. Where could this unprotected  girl be going, alone and in a hotel cab?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not imagine, and when I saw Madame stop in the middle of her talk to buy  some fresh flowers and pin them to Miss Willetts&rsquo; corsage, I got a queer  feeling, and flinging my newspaper aside, I strolled to the door and so out in  time to hear Madame&rsquo;s orders to the chauffeur. The young lady was to be taken  to a museum. To a museum, at this early hour! and alone, alone! Such a proceeding  is not at all in accord with French ideas, and I feared a plot. Though it was  far from being my affair, I determined to make it so; and as soon as I dared, I  followed her just as I had followed her from the dock. But fruitlessly! Not  knowing the danger, how could I avert it? I was in one gallery, she in the  other. It was my evil fate to see her fall, but by whose hand I am as ignorant  as yourselves. <i>Now</i> I have told it all. Will you let me go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; interposed the Coroner. &ldquo;There are one or two questions more which you  will undoubtedly answer with the same frankness. Were you standing in front of  the pedestal or behind it when you saw Miss Willetts fall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was standing just where I said, somewhere near it in the open gallery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  seemed so open to question that the Coroner paused a moment to recall the exact  situation and see if it were possible for a man as conspicuous in figure as Mr.  Travis to have stood thus in full view of gallery and court, without attracting  the attention of anyone in either place. He found, after a moment&rsquo;s  consideration, that it was possible. Mr. Gryce, for all his efforts and  systematic inquiry into the position which each person had held at or near this  time, had been able to find but one who chanced to be looking in the direction  of this gallery, and he with a limited view which took in only the upper part  of the tapestry.</p>
  <p>A  probe in a fresh direction might reach a more vulnerable spot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you had been behind the pedestal?&rdquo; Dr. Price suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;the  quick flush coming again. &ldquo;My old timidity led me to conceal myself where I  could watch undetected her bright young figure pass from arch to arch along the  opposite gallery. Not till she had got past my line of view did I step out, and  then&mdash;then it was to see what I have already told you&mdash;her rush toward the  front&mdash;the start she gave&mdash;the fall&mdash;that cruel arrow! I own that I shrank back  into my narrow hiding-place when I realized that all was at an end&mdash;that she was  dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  You had been witness to a deed of blood&mdash;a deed which must have recalled to you  the anxiety expressed by the woman whom you regarded as the young girl&rsquo;s  guardian; and yet you shrank back&mdash;out of sight&mdash;away from those who had the  right to make inquiries! How do you explain that, Mr. Travis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot, except that I was so dazed, so stricken, that I was hardly conscious of  what I did. And, sirs, believe me or not, had it not been for the refuge  afforded by that narrow space behind the pedestal, I think I should have fallen  headlong to the floor. When I came again to myself, which was after some of the  confusion had abated, I had only one thought in mind: to suppress myself and my  story lest some shadow should fall across her sweet purity. Waiting till the  attention of the man you had placed on guard over her body was attracted  another way, I slid out and hastened to the front, where I managed to find a  quiet room in which to sit down and brood again over my misfortune. Forewarned,  as you have said, and on the spot, with every wish to protect her, I had failed  to do so. I fear it will make me mad some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had  it made him insane already? Was his story to be trusted? It was full of  incongruities; were they those of a disordered mind? Such had been the excuse  made for Mrs. Taylor when she had been thought guilty of this attack; why  should it not be applied to this man who certainly had given evidences of not  being of the usual type of young Englishman? With a sidelong look at Mr. Gryce,  which that individual perfectly understood, Dr. Price thanked Mr. Travis for  his candor and asked if he could point out the room in which he had sat while  their young man had gone through the building checking off the position of  everybody in it.</p>
  <p>To  his surprise, the Englishman answered quite simply, &ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; and rose when  they rose.</p>
  <p>The  glances exchanged between the other two men were eloquent. Where was he about  to take them? Sweetwater was no fool; how had this man of marked appearance and  generous proportions managed to elude him?</p>
  <p>As  has happened before, it proved to be easily explainable when once the  conditions were known. The room to which he led them was that on the upper  story marked H on Chart Two. It was devoted, like one or two others near it, to  a line of famous paintings at once the hope and despair of young girl copyists.  The one most favored for this purpose hung just behind the door &ldquo;X,&rdquo; which,  half-open as they found it, made with the easel, the canvas upon it and an  apron hanging carelessly over all, an impromptu screen behind which a man  crouched in misery on the copyist&rsquo;s stool might easily remain unnoticed by  anyone passing hurriedly by him.</p>
  <p>And  thus vanished one hindrance to a full belief in young Travis&rsquo; story.</p>
  <p>But  a greater one remained. The bow! the bow found behind the tapestry at the edge  of which he had stood in timorous hiding! In the hope that a shock might  startle him into some admission which would give a different aspect to the  case, they now led him back to this place of first concealment. He was showing  strain by this time, and no delay was made to press their point. Giving the  tapestry a pull, the Coroner bade him tell what he saw behind it.</p>
  <p>The  answer came with much emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bow! The bow which sped the arrow which killed Miss Willetts. I do not want to  see it. It hurts me&mdash;hurts me physically. Let me go, I entreat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Travis,&rdquo; urged the Coroner as they again emerged upon the open gallery, &ldquo;you  have said that there was no one with you in the section where you stood. If  that was so, how came this bow to be where you have just seen it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  bewildered look, a slow shake of the head and nothing more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know it was there? Did you see it thrown there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I saw nothing. I am an honest man. You may believe me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Coroner scrutinized him closely but not unkindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  shall know before night who handled that bow, Mr. Travis. It carries its own  clue with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  gleam of unmistakable joy lighted up the Englishman&rsquo;s features.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I am glad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner  Price was a man of experience. He recognized the ring of truth in the Englishman&rsquo;s  tones, and saying no more, led the way from the gallery.</p>
  <p>A  few minutes later he was on the lower floor. He had a short conversation with  the two doormen; then he proceeded to the telephone and called up the  Universal.</p>
  <p>The  result was startling.</p>
  <p>Asked  if the name of Rupert Henry Travis, Hertfordshire, England, was on their  register, the answer was yes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  date of his arrival?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Early  this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  other arrivals to-day from the other side?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a Madame Duclos and a Miss Willetts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Coroner&rsquo;s tone altered. So much of the stranger&rsquo;s story was true, then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you connect me with Madame Duclos. I have important news to give her. Some  woman had better be with her when she receives it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry, but I cannot do this. Madame Duclos has left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Left?  Gone out, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  left the hotel. She&rsquo;s been gone about half an hour. The young lady who came  with her has gone out too, but we expect her back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do. And what took the older woman away? What excuse did she give, and where has  she gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell you where she has gone. She left after receiving a telephone  message from some one in town. Came down to the desk looking extremely  distressed, said that she had had bad news and must go at once. I made out her  bill and, at her request, that of the young lady, whom she said would be called  for by a friend on her return to the hotel. These bills she paid; after that  she left the hotel on foot, carrying her own bag. The young lady has not  returned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough.  The young lady is dead, killed by chance here at the museum. A plain-clothes  man will be with you shortly from Headquarters. Meanwhile keep your eyes and  ears open. If a message comes for either Madame Duclos or Miss Willetts, notify  me here; and if anyone calls, detain the party at all hazards. That&rsquo;s all; no  time to talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  now Gryce entered the room. He was accompanied by an inspector. This was a  welcome addition to their force. Coroner Price greeted him with cordiality:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  come in good time, Inspector. The death of this young girl struck down by an  arrow shot by an unknown hand from the opposite side of the building bids fair  to make a greater call on your resources than on mine. The woman who appears to  have acted as companion to Miss Willetts has fled the hotel where they both  took rooms immediately upon leaving the steamer. Either she has heard of the  accident which has occurred here&mdash;and if so, how?&mdash;or she&rsquo;s but carrying out some  deep-laid plan which it is highly important for us to know. It looks now like a  premeditated crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  this Englishman involved?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt that; I seriously doubt that&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, Gryce? A more subtle head than  his planned this strange crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  there can be little doubt about that. Shall I set the boys to work, Inspector?  This Frenchwoman must be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  once&mdash;a general alarm. You can get a description of her from the clerk at the  Universal. She must not be allowed to leave town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce sat down before the telephone. Coroner Price proceeded to acquaint the  Inspector with such details of the affair as were now known. The Curator moved  restlessly about. Gloom had settled upon the museum. On only one face was there  a smile to be seen, but that was a heavenly one, irradiating the countenance of  her who had passed from the lesser to the larger world with the joy of earth  still warm in her innocent heart.</p>

    On The Search</b></h2>
  <p>It  was late in the afternoon. The Inspector&rsquo;s office had hummed for hours with  messages and reports, and the lull which had finally come seemed grateful to  him. With relaxed brow and a fresh cigar, he sat in quiet contemplation of the  facts brought out by the afternoon&rsquo;s inquiries. He was on the point of  dismissing even these from his mind, when the door opened and Gryce came in.</p>
  <p>Instantly  his responsibilities returned upon him in full force. He did not wait for the  expected report, but questioned the detective at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been to the hotel,&rdquo; he said, pointing out a chair into which the old man  dropped with a sigh as eloquent of anxiety as of fatigue. &ldquo;What more did you  learn there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  little. No message has come; no persons called. For them and for us these two  women, Madame Duclos and Miss Willetts, are still an unknown quantity. Their  baggage, which arrived while I was there, supplied the only information I was  able to obtain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their  baggage! But that should tell us everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may if you think best to go through it. It is not heavy&mdash;a trunk for each,  besides the one they brought with them from the steamer. From the pasters to be  seen on them, they have come from the Continental Hotel, Paris, by way of the  Ritz, London. At this latter place their stay was short. This is proved by the  fact that only the steamer-trunk is pasted with the Ritz label. And this trunk  was the one I found in their room at the Universal. From it Miss Willetts had  taken the dress she wore to the museum. Her other clothes&mdash;I mean those she wore  on arriving&mdash;lay in disorder on the bed and chairs. I should say that they had  been tossed about by a careless if not hasty hand, while the trunk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stood  open on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stood  open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I went through it, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  found nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  to help us to-day. No letters&mdash;no cards. Some clothing&mdash;some little trifles  (bought in Paris, by the way) and one little book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  name in it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;<i>Angeline</i>;  and one line of writing from some poem, I judge. I put it back where I found  it. When we know more, it may help us to find her friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  is that all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost,  but not quite. The young girl had a bag too. It stood on a table&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Empty.  Everything had been tumbled out&mdash;turned upside down and the contents scattered.  I looked them carefully over. Nothing, positively nothing, but what you would  be likely to find in any young girl&rsquo;s traveling-bag. There&rsquo;s but one conclusion  to be drawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  all these things, such as they were, had been pushed hastily about after being  emptied out on the table. That was not the young girl&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  Duclos&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  hit it. She was in search of some one thing she wanted, and she took the  quickest way of finding it. And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Gryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was in a desperate hurry, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have left the trunk open or all those  dainty things lying about. Frenchwomen are methodical and very careful of their  belongings. One other thing I noted. There was a loose nail in the lock of the  trunk. Sticking to this nail was a raveling of brown wool. Here it is, sir. The  woman&mdash;Madame Duclos&mdash;wore a dress of brown serge. If my calculations are not  wrong and we succeed in getting a glimpse of that dress, we shall find a tear  in the skirt&mdash;and what is more, one very near the hem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Made  to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;another  token of haste. She probably jerked at the skirt when she found herself caught.  She could not have been herself to have done this&mdash;for which we may be glad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean that by this thoughtless action she has left a clue in our hands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  and something more. That tear in her decent skirt will bother her. She will  either make an immediate attempt to mend it, or else do the other obvious  thing&mdash;buy a new one. In either case it gives us something by which to trace  her. I have put Sweetwater on that job. He never tires, never wearies, never  lets go. No report in yet from the terminals?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a word. But she will not get far. Sooner or later we shall find her if she does  not come forward herself after reading the evening papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will never come forward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure. Something not a little peculiar happened at the museum after  you left. We had Reynolds up, and he made a most careful examination of that  bow for finger-prints. He did not find any. But fortune favored us in another  way almost as good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  you interest <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  had brought the bow into the Curator&rsquo;s office, and it lay on the long table in  the middle of the room. I had been looking it over (this was after Reynolds had  gone, of course) and had already noted a certain defect in it, when on chancing  to look up, my eyes fell on a mirror hanging in a closet the door of which  stood wide open. A face was visible in it&mdash;a very white face which altered under  my scrutiny into a semblance more natural. It was that of Correy&mdash;you remember  Correy, one of the assistants, and an honest fellow enough, but more troubled  at this moment than I had ever seen him. What could have happened?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wheeling  quickly about, I caught him just as he started to go. He had openly declared  that he did not know this bow; but it was evident that he did, and I did not  hesitate to say so. Taken unawares, he could not hide his distress, which he  proceeded to explain thus: He did remember the bow, now that he had the  opportunity of seeing it closer. He pointed to the nick I had myself noticed  and said that owing to this defect the bow had been cast aside, and the last  time he had handled it&mdash;Here he caught his breath and stopped. Another memory  had evidently returned to embarrass him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you succeed in getting him to acknowledge what it was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  after I had worked with him for some time. He didn&rsquo;t want to talk. In a moment  you will see why. Going back to the time he had seen it before, he said that he  had found it in the cellar in an old box, the contents of which he had been  pulling over in a search for something very different. Amazed to find it there,  he had taken it out, examined it carefully, noted the nick I mentioned and  tossed it back again into the box. This he told, but reluctantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  reluctantly, I was soon to find out. He was not alone in the cellar. The shadow  of some person at his back had fallen across the lid of the box as he was  closing it. He did not recognize the shadow and had not given it at the time a  second thought, but the remembrance of it came back vividly when he saw the bow  lying before him and realized the part it had played in the morning&rsquo;s tragedy.  Was it because he knew that only a person actively connected with the museum  would have access to that part of the cellar? I asked. I did not expect an  answer, and I did not get it. We looked at each other for a moment, then I let  him go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  momentary silence, which the Inspector broke by saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later  I called the Curator in, and he also recognized the bow as belonging to the  museum. But he volunteered no explanations and in fact had little to say on the  subject. He was evidently too much startled by the direct connection which had  thus been made between the crime (or accident, if you will) and the personnel  of the museum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was natural. He should be the first to see that the bow which shot the arrow  must of necessity have been brought into the building by some other door than  those at which the doormen stood guard. I had a talk with those men, and they  both declared that no sticks or umbrellas or anything of that nature ever went  by them or would be allowed to go by them, no matter how concealed or wrapped  up. But to revert to the matter in hand. So Correy made absolutely no attempt  to explain how this weapon had been carried from cellar to gallery without his  knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He for one will have a sleepless night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  he alone. I must and will see a way through this maze. To-morrow may bring  luck. Ah, I forgot to say that I spent an hour of the three you allowed me with  the captain of the steamer which brought over these two women. As might be  expected, he had no information of any significance to give me; nor could I  obtain much from such members of the crew as I could get hold of. One steward  remembered the Englishman, chiefly because he never showed himself unless the  young lady was on deck. But he never saw them speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  bears out Travis&rsquo; story to the last detail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  I think we can depend upon <i>him</i>; otherwise we <i>should</i> be at sea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  his story is a very strange one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  whole affair is strange&mdash;the strangest I ever knew. But that isn&rsquo;t against it.  It&rsquo;s the commonplace case which baffles. We shall get the key to the whole  mystery yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt. Is Mr. Travis to be detained?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  as witness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  he object?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. Having spoken&mdash;told his whole story, as he says&mdash;he is rather glad than  otherwise to be relieved from the common curiosity of strangers. He&rsquo;s a rare  bird, Gryce. If he stops to think, he must see that he stands in a more or less  ticklish position. But he does not betray by look or action any doubt of our  entire belief in the truth of all his statements. His only trouble seems to be  that he has lost, by these inhuman means, the girl upon whom he had set his  heart. To-morrow we will confront him with Mrs. Taylor. She should be able to  say whether he did or did not stand out in the open gallery at the moment Miss  Willetts fell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Gryce had no encouragement to give him on this head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Taylor is ill&mdash;very ill, as I take it. I stopped at her hotel to inquire. I was  anxious about her for more than one reason and the report I got of her  condition was far from favorable. She is suffering cruelly from shock. How  occasioned, whether by the peculiar and startling death to which she was a  witness or by the strangely coincident fancy to which she herself attributes  her deep emotion, will have to be decided by further developments. Nothing which  I was able to learn from doctor or nurse settled this interesting question.  Meanwhile, no one is allowed to see her&mdash;or will be till she is on the direct  road to recovery. Let us hope that this may be soon, or the inquest may be  delayed indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know as that is to be deplored. I imagine we shall find enough to fill in  our time.... Any communications made by her before she collapsed? Did she send  out or receive messages of any kind since her return from the museum?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  received none; but it is impossible to say whether or not she sent any out.  There is a letter-chute very near her door. She may have dropped a letter in  that any time before a watch was put upon her. You are thinking, of course, of  the anxiety she expressed about her husband, and whether she took any measures  for ascertaining if her fears for him had any foundation in fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was, yes; but I presume this fancy had passed, or else she is too ill to  remember her own aberrations. Were you able to effect an understanding with her  nurse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  that&rsquo;s fixed. I had a short talk, too, with the proprietor of the hotel. He  thinks very highly of Mrs. Taylor. She has lived in the one apartment for  years, and he cannot say enough of her discreet and uniform life. Though she  made no secret of the fact that she does not live with her husband, her conduct  has always been such as to insure universal respect. He did not even make  mention of eccentricities. If she is crazy, it is a late development. She  seemed to have been all right up to this morning. Whichever way you turn, you  encounter mystery and a closed door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  papers may spring the lock of that door at any moment. Publication does much in  a case of this kind. To-morrow we may be in a much more favorable position.  Meantime, let us recount the facts it is our business to clear up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  what hypothesis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  all hypotheses. We are not sure enough of our premises, as yet, to confine  ourselves to one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good, these are the ones which seem to me to be of the greatest importance:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose  hand carried the bow from cellar to gallery?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it the same which carried the arrow from one gallery to the other?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it possible for an arrow, shot through the loophole made by the curving-in of  the vase, to reach the mark set for it by Mr. Travis&rsquo; testimony?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  one of the men or women known to be in the museum when this arrow was released  has enough knowledge of archery to string a bow? A mark can be reached by  chance; but only an accustomed hand can string a bow as unyielding as this one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  telephoned to Madame Duclos; and of what nature was the message which sent her  from the hotel so precipitately that she not only left the most important part  of her baggage behind but went away without making adequate provision for the  young girl confided to her charge?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  this mean that she had been made acquainted with the fate of the young girl;  and if so, by whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Business  enough for us all,&rdquo; was the Inspector&rsquo;s comment as Gryce paused in this  enumeration. &ldquo;As you put it, I am more and more convinced that the key you  spoke of a short time ago will be found in this missing woman&rsquo;s tightly shut  hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  brings us round full-circle to our first conclusion: that Miss Willetts&rsquo; death  is not only a crime, but a premeditated one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carried  out, not by the one benefited, but by an agent selected for the purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  agent, moreover, who knew the ways and possibilities of the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  logical conclusion; but still too incredible for belief. I find it hard to  trust to appearances in this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I also. But as we have both said, time may clear away some of its  incongruities. Meanwhile I have an experiment to propose.&rdquo; And leaning close to  the Inspector, notwithstanding the fact that there was nobody within hearing  and he knew it, he whispered a few words in his ear.</p>
  <p>The  Inspector stared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>
  <p>The  detective nodded.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="IX"></a><b>IX<br>
    While The City Slept</b></h2>
  <p>Night&mdash;the  night of a great city with its myriad of garish lights and its many curious and  incongruous activities.</p>
  <p>Who  has not felt his imagination stirred by the contrasts thus offered&mdash;contrasts  never more apparent than at these hours of supposed rest? Grim walls, with  dimpled children sleeping behind them! Places of merrymaking athrob with music  and dazzling with jets of incandescent light, with grief in the heart of the  dancer and despair making raucous the enforced laugh!</p>
  <p>But  nowhere in the great city of which we write on this night of May 23, 1913, was  there to be found a scene of greater contradictions than in the court and  galleries of its famous museum.</p>
  <p>Lighted  as for a reception, the architectural beauties of its Moorish arcades and  carven balustrades flashed in full splendor. Gems of antique art, casts in  which genius had stored its soul and caused to live before us the story of the  ancients, pillars from desert sands, friezes from the Parthenon and bas-reliefs  from Nineveh and Heliopolis, filled every corner, commanding the eye to satisfy  itself in forms of deathless grace or superhuman power. And no one to heed! Not  an eye to note that the Venus in one corner seemed to smile in the soft light  with more than its accustomed allurement, or that the armor in which kings had  fought wore a menacing sparkle exceeding that of other times and quieter days.  Ghosts of vanished ages might parade at will among the chattels of their time  or drain the iridescent beaker to their unknown gods&mdash;no one would have noticed  or turned aside to see. For there was something else within these walls  to-night for the men assembled there to look upon, and a story to be read which  shut the imagination upon the past by amply filling it with the present.</p>
  <p>What  is this something? Let us follow the gaze of the half-dozen persons grouped in  front of the tapestry hanging in the northern gallery, and see.</p>
  <p>But  first, of whom is this small and mystic group composed? Who are these men who  in the middle of the night, in the security of a completely shuttered building,  busy themselves, not with the inestimable treasures surrounding them, but with  an odd and seemingly mountebank adventure totally out of keeping with the place  and their absorbed demeanor? We will name them:</p>
  <p>Mr.  Roberts and a second director seen here for the first time, Inspector Jackson,  Mr. Gryce, two lesser detectives, and a strange young man of undoubted Indian  extraction who kept much in the background and yet stood always at attention  like one awaiting orders.</p>
  <p>Are  these all? Yes, in the one gallery; but in the other, shadowy figures are  visible among the arches at one end, with whose identity we shall probably soon  be made acquainted.</p>
  <p>At  what are these various persons, in the one gallery as in the other, looking so  intently that all are turned one way&mdash;the way of greatest interest&mdash;the way the  fatal arrow had flown some fourteen hours before, carrying death to the  innocent girl smiling upon life in youthful exuberance? Is it at some image of  herself they see restored to hope and joy? An image is there, but alas! it is  but a dummy taken from one of the exhibits and so set up as to present the same  angle to the gallery-front as her young body had done, according to Mr. Travis&rsquo;  reluctant declaration.</p>
  <p>Why  so placed, and why regarded with such concentrated interest by the men  confronting it from the opposite gallery, will become apparent when, upon the  Indian&rsquo;s being summoned from his place of modest retirement, it can be seen  that the bow he carries in one hand is offset by the arrow he holds in the  other. A test is to be made which will settle, or so they hope, the truth of  Mr. Travis&rsquo; story. If an arrow launched from before the pedestal or even from  behind it through the loophole made by the curving-in of the vase toward its  base can be made to reach its mark in the breast of this dummy, then they would  feel some justification in doubting his statement that the arrow, whatever the  appearances, was not shot from this gallery. If it could not, belief in his  statements would be confirmed and their minds be cleared of a doubt which must  hamper all their future movements.</p>
  <p>The  second director, whose name was Clayton, stood at the left of the Inspector and  close against the tapestry. To him that official now turned with this  explanation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bow you see in Mr. La Fl&egrave;che&rsquo;s hand is similar in length and weight to the one  found lying strung for use in the doorway back of where you are now standing.  The arrow is from the same quiver as the one which entered Miss Willetts&rsquo;  breast.... Did you speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No,  Mr. Clayton had not spoken; yet for some reason a thrill had passed through the  small group surrounding him, which had heightened the consciousness of them  all. Eyes and ears became alert; only the Indian showed stolidity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  La Fl&egrave;che, you will first stand here,&rdquo; continued the Inspector, pointing to the  spot which Mr. Travis had finally settled upon as the one where he had been  standing at the moment he saw Miss Willetts fall.</p>
  <p>The  Indian took the place, sighted the figure diagonally opposite and laid his  finger on the string.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  inch to the left of the bunch of flowers pinned on the dummy&rsquo;s breast,&rdquo;  murmured Mr. Gryce almost in his ear.</p>
  <p>It  was a breathless moment; even the two detectives showed excitement.</p>
  <p>But  the Indian failed to shoot. Instead, he looked around at the Inspector and  quietly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will shoot standing, since you so request, but I think you will find that the  arrow which caused death was delivered by a man kneeling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  flash of the eye between the two detectives, which only one man saw! All the  others were watching the lightning flight of the arrow. It struck the dummy  full and square. Everyone shuddered, even the Inspector; it brought the real  tragedy so vividly to mind.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  a movement had taken place in the small group of men watching from the other  side. One of them stepped fully into view and approaching the figure thus  attacked, drew out the arrow and made close examination of the hole it had made  and shook his head. It was Coroner Price.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  again, and from behind the pedestal this time,&rdquo; he called out across the  intervening space as he stepped back into his former place of observation.</p>
  <p>The  Inspector motioned his wishes to the Indian, who with a subtle twist of his  body slipped behind the pedestal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  better,&rdquo; was the Inspector&rsquo;s quick comment. &ldquo;Can you handle the bow easily from  where you now stand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is plenty of room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well. But wait! Before we proceed further, there is a matter to which I wish to  call the attention of these gentlemen. It must have been apparent to you all  that a person standing where Mr. La Fl&egrave;che did a moment ago would be easily  visible to anyone looking up from the court or across from the opposite  gallery, or even from the broad corridors at either end of the building. But  would the same hold true if instead of being in front he had been behind the  pedestal, as Mr. La Fl&egrave;che is now? Run below, Barney; and, gentlemen, disperse  yourselves in different directions and give me your opinion. Now!&rdquo; he demanded  after a few minutes&rsquo; wait, during which there had been a scattering to right  and left along the galleries, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  anyone chanced to be looking directly there, yes,&rdquo; was shouted up from below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you say, Coroner Price?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  the man to kneel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Inspector gave the word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s different! The bulge of the vase hides the upper part of his head, and  the pedestal itself the lower. He might shoot from his present position with  impunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you all agree?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes!&rdquo; came from different parts of the building.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  Mr. La Fl&egrave;che, here&rsquo;s another arrow from the same quiver. Take fresh aim and  shoot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  breathless moment&mdash;more breathless than the other; then a second arrow flew  across the court and hung quivering in the breast of the dummy.</p>
  <p>From  both ends of the gallery men came running, and leaning eagerly over the  gallery-rail they watched the Coroner as he stepped again into view to make a  second examination.</p>
  <p>This  time he kept them several minutes in suspense, and when he had drawn out the  arrow, he looked long at the hole it had made. Then, instead of shouting his  decision across the court, he could be seen leaving the gallery and coming  around their way.</p>
  <p>What  had he to say? As they waited, a clock struck from some neighboring  steeple&mdash;three sonorous peals! The two directors glanced at each other.  Doubtless they felt the weirdness of the hour as well as of the occasion. It  was a new experience for these amateurs in police procedure.</p>
  <p>Arrived  on their side, the Coroner advanced quickly. When close upon the reassembled  group, he remarked quickly but with great decision:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Travis seems to have been correct in denying that the arrow flew either from  before or behind this pedestal. The first arrow sent by Mr. La Fl&egrave;che entered  the dummy almost at a right angle; the last departed but a little from this  same line. But the real wound which I probed and located to a hair was a  decidedly slanting one. It must have been sent from a place further off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  behind the other pedestal!&rdquo; spoke up Mr. Gryce, all fire and interest at once. &ldquo;Either  the Englishman deceived us, or each pedestal had its man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  see! Another shot, and from behind the further pedestal, Mr. La Fl&egrave;che!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Indian glided into view and started for the other end of the tapestry, followed  by the Inspector, his detectives and the two directors. As they passed one by  one across the face of the great hanging, they had the appearance not of living  men but of a parade of specters, so silent their step and so somber their air.  The dread of some development hitherto unacknowledged made their movements slow  instead of hasty. The upper pedestal instead of the lower! Why should this  possible fact make any difference in their feelings. Yet it did&mdash;perhaps because  it meant deception on the part of one they had instinctively believed  trustworthy, or&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  why pursue conjecture when actuality only is of moment? Let us proceed with our  relation and await the result.</p>
  <p>Arrived  at the upper pedestal, Mr. La Fl&egrave;che took his place, received the third arrow  and presently delivered it. The Coroner, who had already started for the other  side, hastily approached the dummy, made his examination and threw up his hand  with the loud shout:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  shot was made from there; the matter is settled!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Question:  Had Mr. Travis wilfully misled them, or had the presumption in his favor been  strengthened by this proof that it had been shown possible for another hand  than his to have shot the arrow from this same section of the gallery, without  disturbing his belief that he was the only person in it at the time?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="X"></a><b>X<br>
  &ldquo;And He Stood <i>Here</i>?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The  Inspector, finding himself very much disturbed by the doubt just mentioned,  felt inclined to question whether any perceptible advancement had been made by  this freak business of his canny subordinate. He was hardly ready to say yes,  and was not a little surprised when on his way toward the head of the staircase  he heard the exultant voice of Mr. Gryce whisper in his ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right. We&rsquo;ve gained a point. We know now the exact place from which the  arrow was shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not who shot it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;except  that it was not the man Travis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you be sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  two reasons. This is the first one: If it is difficult to understand how a man  could slip from behind the eastern pedestal and make his way along the open  gallery to Room H, without attracting the attention of the officer posted  opposite, how next to impossible we should find it, if thirty feet were added  to his course&mdash;which is the distance between the two pedestals!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was that fellow doing, that he shouldn&rsquo;t have seen this effort at escape,  whether it involved a short flight or a long one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  says he was not given detective-duty&mdash;that he was placed there to keep watch  over the body of the young girl;&mdash;that at a certain moment he imagined himself  to hear a stealthy footstep approaching from the farther end of the gallery,  and anxious to spot the man yielding to so doubtful a curiosity, he approached  the arch separating his section from the adjoining one, and stopping just  inside, stood for a moment or so, listening. As this involved the turning of  his back upon the court and consequently upon the opposite gallery, it gave  Travis just the opportunity he needed for an unobserved escape. But I see you  are not very much impressed by the reason I have advanced for believing his  story and placing him where he says he was placed, behind the eastern pedestal.  You doubtless think that if the officer opposite had stood long enough with his  back to the court, Travis might have taken those extra thirty steps as easily  as the twenty he had confessed to. Listen, then, to my second reason, or  rather, step this way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leading  his superior toward Room B, the door of which stood wide open, he paused just  outside the threshold to note the effect produced upon the Inspector by what he  saw inside. Evidently it was as marked with surprise as the detective had  calculated upon, for with an air of great astonishment the Inspector turned  upon him with the whispered exclamation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Travis  here! where he could listen&mdash;see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Take a good look at him, Inspector. It won&rsquo;t trouble him any. I doubt if he  would notice us if we stepped into the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  such was the opinion of the Inspector himself, as he remarked the extreme  excitement under which the Englishman was laboring. Absorbed in thoughts of his  own, he was pacing the room with long strides, turning mechanically as he met  some impediment, but otherwise oblivious to his surroundings, even to the point  of not noting the presence of Sweetwater, who stood quietly watching him from  one of the corners.</p>
  <p>This  display of feeling was certainly eloquent enough to attract anyone&rsquo;s attention,  but what gave it impressiveness to the official mind was this: his excitement  was that of triumph, not fear, of hope without any trace of confusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not of himself he is thinking,&rdquo; muttered Gryce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he stood <i>here</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;we  left him free to move about at will, and his will carried him into full view of  the whole performance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Sweetwater?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  near enough to note his every move, but of course kept himself well out of  sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  as they both stepped back from the doorway: &ldquo;Mr. Travis didn&rsquo;t know he was  being watched. He thought himself alone; and having an expressive  countenance,&mdash;very expressive for an Englishman,&mdash;it was easy enough for  Sweetwater to read his thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  those thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Relief  to find an explanation of the phenomenon he had doubtless been puzzling over  for hours. The moments he had spent in hiding behind one pedestal had evidently  failed to suggest that another man might have been in hiding behind the other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not surprised. Coincidences of this astonishing kind are not often met with  even by us,&rdquo; was the Inspector&rsquo;s dry retort.</p>
  <p>During  the interchange of these hurried sentences, they had withdrawn still farther  out of sight and hearing of the man discussed. But at this point Inspector  Jackson reapproached the doorway, and entering in a manner to intercept Mr.  Travis in his nervous goings to and fro, remarked in an off-hand way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that you have met with a surprise, Mr. Travis. Like ourselves, you gave  little thought to what that upper pedestal might conceal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right. I never even glanced that way. But if I had, I should have seen  nothing. He was well hid, exceedingly well hid, whoever he was. But he cannot  escape now; you&rsquo;ll get him, won&rsquo;t you, Inspector? He could not have left the  building&mdash;all say that this was impossible. He was one, then, of the people I  saw moving about when I went down into the court. Find him! Find this murderer  of innocence! of the sweetest, purest child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned away; grief was taking the place of indignation and revenge. At this  sight the two men left him. The Inspector was at last convinced, both of the  man&rsquo;s probity and of one stern, disconcerting fact: that the real culprit&mdash;the  man whose guilty fingers had launched the fatal arrow&mdash;had been, as Travis said,  one of the twenty-two persons who had been moving about for hours not only  under his eyes but under those of the famous detective posted there.</p>

    Footsteps</b></h2>
  <p class="newspaper">WANTED&mdash;A  WOMAN CALLING HERSELF ANTOINETTE Duclos, just arrived from Europe on the  steamer <i>Castania</i>, who after taking rooms at the Universal for herself  and her steamer companion, Angeline Willetts, left the hotel in great haste  late in the afternoon of May twenty-third and has not been heard of since.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">In  person she is of medium height, but stocky for a Frenchwoman. Dark hair, black  eyes, with an affection of the lid which causes the left one to droop. Her  dress consisted of skirt and jacket of a soft shade of brown. Hat  indistinguishable. She carried, on leaving the hotel, a dark brown leather bag  of medium size, long and narrow in shape. Her only peculiarity, saving the one  drooping eyelid, is a hesitating walk. This is particularly obvious when she  attempts to hasten.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">It  is to be hoped that this person on hearing of Miss Willetts&rsquo; death, will  communicate at once with the clerk of the hotel.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">If  in two days this does not occur, a reward of five hundred dollars will be given  to the man or woman who can give definite news of this Frenchwoman&rsquo;s  whereabouts.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Police  Headquarters, Mulberry St.</p>
  <p>This  notice, appended to such particulars of the tragedy as appeared in all the morning  papers, roused the city&mdash;I may even say the country&mdash;to even greater wonder and  excitement than had followed the first details given in the journals of the  evening before.</p>
  <p>Would  anything come of it?</p>
  <p>Morning  passed; no news of Antoinette Duclos.</p>
  <p>Afternoon:  messages of all kinds leading to much work, but bringing no result.</p>
  <p>Five  o&rsquo;clock: a missive from the directors of the museum to the effect that under  the peculiar circumstances and the seeming absence of any friends of the  deceased, they would be glad to furnish the means necessary to the proper care  and burial of the young woman killed in such an unhappy manner within their  walls.</p>
  <p>A  half-hour later, Gryce, for whose appearance the Inspector had been anxiously  waiting, came in with his report. A chair was pushed up for him, for he was an  old man and had had a sleepless night, as we know, besides two days of  continued work. But he did not drop into it, as the Inspector expected, or give  any other signs of exceptional fatigue; yet when he had seated himself and they  were left alone, he did not hasten to speak, though he evidently had much to  say, but remained quiet, holding counsel, as it were, in his old way, with some  small object he had picked up from the desk before him.</p>
  <p>At  last the Inspector spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been on the hunt; what did you find?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much, Inspector&mdash;and yet enough to disturb me in a way I was not looking for. Of  course, in studying the situation carefully, you have asked yourself how the  man who shot the arrow from behind the upper pedestal got away. He did not wait  as Travis did till the first excitement had abated and the way was, in a  manner, cleared for an escape into the court. For X, as we will call him, was  certainly among those I saw lined up before me at the moment I bade them one  and all to return and stand until released, in the exact spot occupied by them  when the first alarm rang out. After the surprise Travis gave us we had the  building searched from roof to cellar. Not another soul was found in it whose  name was not registered on the chart. As I have already said, the guilty one  had managed to escape immediately upon the flight of the arrow, though how,  even then, he could have got below in the time he did is a mystery which trips  me up every time I think of it. But letting that go for the present, he did get  there and get there unnoticed. How? Now, there are three ways of escape from  behind either of those pedestals. The way Travis took, that is, toward the  front, and round through the suite of rooms headed by the one marked H, to the  rear staircase; the more direct one of an immediate exit from the gallery  through Sections VI and VII to this same staircase; and (the only one worth  considering) a straight plunge for the door behind the tapestry and so down by  the winding staircase beyond, into the Curator&rsquo;s office. The unknown never went  Travis&rsquo; way, and he couldn&rsquo;t have gone the other without running into the arms  of Correy; so he must have made use of the hidden door. So convinced was I of  this, after last night&rsquo;s discovery eliminated Travis as a suspect, that I made  it my first duty this morning to examine this door and the mysterious little  passageway back of it. When first notified of this door, we had been assured  that it had not been opened in years, that the only key remaining to it was the  one the Curator showed us hanging from the ring he drew from his own pocket;  and acting upon these statements, which I would not allow myself to doubt for a  moment, we decided to open the door in our own way, which we immediately did.  The result was the instant discovery that some one had passed through this door  and down these stairs very much later than years ago. We could see, without  taking a step beyond the doorway, traces of a well-shod foot in the dust lying  thickly on every tread. These traces were so many and so confused that I left  them for Stevens&rsquo; experienced eye and deft manipulation to separate and make  plain to us. He is making an examination of them now, and will be able to  report to you before night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Inspector was a man of little pretense. He felt startled and showed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this is a serious matter, Gryce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  serious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  mere visitor to the museum would have presumed upon this venture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  some one actively connected with it had a guilty hand in this deplorable  affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  one well acquainted with the existence of this door and who had means of  opening it. The question is&mdash;who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  saying this, Mr. Gryce studiously avoided the Inspector&rsquo;s eye; while the  Inspector in his turn looked up, then down&mdash;anywhere but in the detective&rsquo;s  direction. It was a moment of mutual embarrassment, broken, when it was broken,  by a remark which manifestly avoided the issue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly  those traces you speak of were not made at the time you specify. They may have  been made since, or they may have been made before. Perhaps the Curator was  curious and tried his hand at a little detective work on his own account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  hadn&rsquo;t the chance. Every portion of the building has been very thoroughly guarded  since first we entered it. He may have gone up prior to the shooting. That is  open to dispute; but if he had done so, why did he not inform us of the fact  when he showed us the key? The Curator is the soul of honor. He would hardly  deceive us in so important a matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  quick glance which this elicited from the Inspector awoke no corresponding  flash in the eye of the imperturbable detective. He continued to shake his head  over the small object he was twirling thoughtfully about between his thumb and  finger, and only from his general seriousness could the Inspector gather that  his mind was no more at rest than his fingers. Was this why his remark took the  form of a question?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was the Curator when you forced open that door behind the tapestry? Was he  anywhere in the building?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; he has not been there to-day. He was ill last night, and he is ill to-day.  He sent us his excuses. If he had been in the building, I doubt whether I would  have given the order to burst open the door. I would simply have requested him  to use his key. And he would have done so and kept his own counsel. I do not  know as I can say as much for any of his subordinates. Happily, no spying eye  was about at that time; and Stevens will be sure to see that he is not watched  at his work if he has to lock the door upon the whole bunch of directors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is to be a secret investigation, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would so advise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  every reporter headed off, and anyone likely to report to a reporter headed off  also?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not <i>you</i> advise this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. Anything more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  till we hear from Stevens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  had not long to wait. Sooner than they expected the expert mentioned came in.  He held a batch of papers in his hand, which at a gesture from the Inspector he  spread out before them. Then he spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  man and one man only has passed down those stairs. But that man has passed down  them twice&mdash;once with rubbers on and once without. There are signs equally plain  of his having gone up them, but only once, and at the time he wore the rubbers.  I took every pains possible to preserve and photograph the prints, but as you  see, great confusion was caused by the second line of steps falling half on and  half off the other. All I dare read there is this: A quick run up and a quick  run down by a man in rubbers, and then a second run down by the same man in  shoes. That&rsquo;s the whole story. These other scraps of paper,&rdquo; he went on as he  saw the Inspector&rsquo;s eye travel to some small bits lying on the side, &ldquo;are what  I have to show as the result of my search on and about the western pedestal for  finger-prints. A gloved hand drew that bow. See here: this is an impression I  obtained from the inner edge of the pedestal in question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  pulled forward a small square of paper; the sewing of a kid glove was plainly  indicated there.</p>
  <p>When  Stevens had gone, the Inspector exclaimed meaningly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gryce!  Name your man; we shall get on faster.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  aged detective rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give me one&mdash;two days. I must have time to think&mdash;to collect  my evidence. A name once mentioned leaves an echo. When my echo rings, it must  carry no false sound. Remember, I did not sleep last night. When I present this  case to you as I see it, I must be at my best. I am not at my best to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was doubtless true, but the Inspector had not discovered it.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XII"></a><b>XII<br>
  &ldquo;Spare Nobody! I Say, Spare Nobody!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>On  his way home Mr. Gryce stopped at the Calderon to inquire how Mrs. Taylor was  doing, and what his prospects were for a limited interview with her.</p>
  <p>He  was told that no such interview could be considered for days&mdash;that she still lay  in a stupor, with brief flashes of acute consciousness, during which she would  scream &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo;&mdash;that brain fever was feared and that increased excitement  might be fatal.</p>
  <p>Another  bar to progress! He had hoped to help her memory into supplying him with a fact  which would greatly simplify a task whose anomalies secretly alarmed him. She  had been in a fair state of mind before her nerve was attacked by the event  which robbed the little Angeline of life and herself of reason, and if  carefully approached, might possibly recall some of the impressions made upon  her previous to that moment. If, for instance, she could describe even in a  general way the appearance of any person she may have seen advancing in the  direction of the northern gallery at the moment she herself turned to enter the  southern one, what a stability it would give to his theory, and what certainty  to his future procedure!</p>
  <p>But  he must wait for this, as he must wait for Angeline&rsquo;s story from Madame Duclos.  Meantime, a word with Sweetwater&mdash;after which, rest.</p>
  <p>It  was Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s custom, especially when engaged upon a case of marked  importance, to receive this, his recognized factotum, in his own home. No  prying ears, no watchful eyes, were to be feared there. He was the absolute  master of everything, even of Sweetwater, he sometimes thought. For this young  fellow loved him&mdash;had reason to; and when Sweetwater played the violin, as he  sometimes did after one of their long talks, the aged detective came as near  happiness as he ever did, now that his little grandchild was married and had  gone with her husband to the other side of the world.</p>
  <p>To-night  he was not anticipating any such relaxation as this, yet to Sweetwater,  arriving later than he wished, he had never looked more in need of it, as,  sitting in his old and somewhat dingy library, he mused over some little object  he held in his half-closed palm, with an intent, care-worn gaze which it  distressed his young subordinate to see. Uncertainty incites the young and  fires them to action; but it wearies the old and saps what little strength they  have; and Sweetwater detected uncertainty in his patron&rsquo;s troubled brow and  prolonged stare at the insignificant article absorbing his attention.</p>
  <p>However,  Gryce roused quickly at the young detective&rsquo;s cheery greeting, and looking up  with an answering welcome, plunged at once into business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you have seen Turnbull! What did the man say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  it was the left-hand upper corner of the tapestry he saw shaking, and not the  right-hand one as we had blindly supposed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  Then we can take it for granted that our new theory is well founded. Certain  things have come to light in your absence. That tapestry was pulled aside not  merely for the purpose of flinging in the bow, but to let the flinger pass  through the door at its back down to the Curator&rsquo;s office and so out into the  court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!  And who....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  this fact had been made known to me sooner, you would have had a different day&rsquo;s  work; not getting it until late this afternoon, we have perhaps wasted some  valuable hours. But we won&rsquo;t fret about that. Mrs. Taylor being no better, we  are likely to have all the time we want for substantiating my idea. It cannot  take long if we succeed either in tracing the Duclos woman or in drawing the  net I am quietly manufacturing, so closely about&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve decided to call him  X&mdash;that it will hold against all opposition. I have hopes of finding the woman,  but great doubts as to the efficacy of the net I have mentioned; it will have  to be so wide and deep, and so absolutely without a single weak strand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  sat astonished, and what was more, silent&mdash;he who had a word for everything.  Accustomed as he was to the varying moods of his remarkable friend, he had  never before been met with a reticence so absolute. It made him think; but for  once in his life did not make him loquacious.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce seemed to be gratified by this, though he made no remark to that effect  and continued to preserve his abstracted look and quiet demeanor. So Sweetwater  waited, and while waiting managed to steal a glimpse at the small object to  which his professional friend still paid his undivided attention.</p>
  <p>It  looked like a narrow bit of dingy black cloth&mdash;just that and nothing more&mdash;a  thing as trivial as the band which clips a closed umbrella. Was it such a band,  and would he presently be asked to find the umbrella from which it had fallen  or been twisted away? No. Umbrellas are not carried about museum buildings.  Besides, this strip of cloth had no ring on the end of it. Consequently it  could not have served the purpose he had just ascribed to it. It must have had  some other use.</p>
  <p>But  when, after an impatient flinging aside of this nondescript article, Mr. Gryce  spoke, it was to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had a long talk with Correy to-day. It seems that he goes through both  galleries every morning before the museum opens. Though he will not swear to  it, he is of the opinion that the quiver holding the Apache arrows had its full  complement when he passed it that morning. He has a way of running things over  with his eye which has never yet failed to draw his attention to anything  defective or in the least out of order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, sir,&rdquo; acquiesced Sweetwater in an odd tone, Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s attitude showing  that he awaited some expression of interest on his part.</p>
  <p>The  elder detective either did not notice the curious note in the younger one&rsquo;s  voice, or noticing it, chose to ignore it, for with no change of manner he  proceeded to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you would exercise your wits, Sweetwater, on the following troublesome  question: if the arrow which slew this young girl was in one gallery at ten o&rsquo;clock,  how did it get into the other at twelve? The bow&rdquo;&mdash;here he purposely hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;might  have been brought up the iron staircase. But the arrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  eyes were on Sweetwater (a direct glance was a rare thing with Mr. Gryce), and  he waited&mdash;waited patiently for the word which did not come; then he remarked  dryly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are both dull; you are tired with your day&rsquo;s work and I with mine: we will let  difficult questions rest until our brains are clearer. But&rdquo;&mdash;here he reached for  the strip of dingy cloth he had cast aside, and tossing it over to Sweetwater,  added with some suggestion of humor,&mdash;&ldquo;if you want a subject to dream upon  to-night, there it is. If you have no desire to dream, and want work for  to-morrow, make an effort to discover from whose clothing that fell and what  was its use. It was picked up in Room B on the second floor, the one where Mrs.  Taylor was detained before going downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  something tangible at last!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know about that; I honestly don&rsquo;t know. But we cannot afford to let  anything go by us. Little things like that have not infrequently opened up a  fresh trail which otherwise might have been missed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  nodded, and laying the little strip along his palm, examined it closely. It was  made of silk, doubled, and stitched together except at the ends. These were  loose, but rough with bits of severed thread, as if the thing had been hastily  cut from some article of clothing to which it had been attached by some  half-dozen very clumsy stitches.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I understand you, Mr. Gryce,&rdquo; observed Sweetwater, rising slowly to his  feet. &ldquo;But a dream may help me out; we will see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not leave here till ten to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good, sir. If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll take this with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  it, by all means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Sweetwater turned to go, he was induced by the silence of his patron to cast a  backward glance. Mr. Gryce had risen to his feet and was leaning toward him  with an evident desire to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if your dreams lead you to undertake the search I have  mentioned, spare nobody; I say, spare <i>nobody</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  he sat down; and the memory which Sweetwater carried away with him of the old  detective at the moment he uttered this final injunction was far from being a  cheerful one.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XIII"></a><b>XIII<br>
  &ldquo;Write Me His Name&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Refreshed  by a good night&rsquo;s rest and quite ready to take up his task again, Mr. Gryce sat  at the same table in the early morning, awaiting the expected message from  Sweetwater. Meanwhile he studied, with a fuller attention than he had been able  to give it the evening before, the memorandum which this young fellow had  handed him of his day&rsquo;s work. A portion of this may be interesting to the  reader. Against the list of people registered on his chart as present in the  museum at the moment of tragedy, he had inscribed such details concerning them  as he could gather in the short time allotted him.</p>

  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>As  on the evening before, Mr. Gryce lingered longest over one name. He was still  brooding anxiously over it when the telephone rang at his elbow and he was  called up from Headquarters. Cablegrams had been received from London and Paris  in acknowledgment of those sent, and in both these cablegrams promises were  made of a full examination into the antecedents of Madame Duclos and her  companion, Miss Willetts.</p>
  <p>That  was all. No further news regarding them from any quarter. Mr. Gryce hung up the  receiver with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is likely to be a long road full of unexpected turns and perilously near the  precipice&rsquo;s edge,&rdquo; he muttered in weary comment to himself. &ldquo;Nothing to start  from but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Sweetwater walked in.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce showed surprise. He had not expected to see the young man himself.  Perhaps he was not quite ready to, for he seemed to shrink, for one brief  instant, as from an unwelcome presence.</p>
  <p>But  the cheer which always entered with Sweetwater was contagious, and the old  detective smiled as the newcomer approached, saying significantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had those dreams you spoke of last night, Mr. Gryce, and found them too weighty  for the telephone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, I see! Sit down, Sweetwater, and tell me how they ran. I haven&rsquo;t as much  confidence in my own dreams as I hope to have in yours. Speak up! Mention  names, if you want to. No echo follows confidences uttered in this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that; but for the present perhaps it will be best for me to follow your  lead, and when I have to speak of a certain person, say X as you do. X, Mr.  Gryce, is the man who for reasons we do not yet understand brought up the  discarded bow from the cellar and stored it somewhere within reach on the floor  above. X is also the man who for the same unknown reason robbed the quiver  hanging in the southern gallery of one of its arrows and kept the same on hand  or in hiding, till he could mate it with the bow. My dreams showed me this  picture:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man with a predominating interest in sport, but otherwise active in business,  correct in his dealings and respectable in private life, sees and frequently  handles weapons of ancient and modern make which rouse his interest and awaken  the longing, common to such men, to test his skill in their use. Sometimes it  is a sword, which he twirls vigorously in sly corners. Again, it is a bow  calling for a yeoman&rsquo;s strength to pull. He is a man of sense and for a long  time goes no further than the play I have just indicated. Perhaps he has no  temptation to go further until one unfortunate day he comes upon an idle bow,  rotting away in the cellar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Mr. Gryce looked sharply up&mdash;a proof of awakened interest which Sweetwater did  not heed. Possibly he was not expected to. At all events he continued rapidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a fine, strong bow, a typical one from the plains. He took it up&mdash;examined  it closely&mdash;noted a slight defect in it somewhere&mdash;and put it back. But he did  not forget it. Before many days had passed, he goes down cellar again and  brings it up and stands it on end in&mdash;where do you think, sir?&mdash;in the closet of  the Curator&rsquo;s office!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you learn that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the woman who comes every day to wipe up the floors. I happened to think she  might have something worth while to tell us, so I hunted her up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, boy. Another long mark in your favor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, sir. I&rsquo;m relating a dream, you know. He stands it on end then in this  closet into which nobody is supposed to go but the Curator <i>and</i> the  scrubwoman, and there he leaves it, possibly as yet with no definite intention.  How long it stood there I cannot say. It was well hidden, it seems, by  something or other hanging over it. Nor am I altogether sure that it might not  be standing there yet if the impulse swaying X had not been strengthened by  seeing daily over his head a quiver full of arrows admirably fitted for this  bow. Time has no place in dreams, or I might be able to state the day and the  hour when he stood looking at the ring of keys lying on the Curator&rsquo;s desk, and  struck with what it might do for him, singled out one of the keys which he  placed in the keyhole of a door opening upon a certain little iron staircase.  He was alone, but he stopped to listen before turning that key. I can see him,  can&rsquo;t you? His air is a guilty one; but it is the guilt of folly, not of  premeditated crime. He wants a try at that bow and recognizes his weakness and  laughs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  his longing holds, and running up the little staircase to a second door, he  unlocks this also and after another moment of hesitation pulls it open. He has  brought the bow with him, but he does not take it past the drapery hanging  straight down before his eyes. He simply drops it in the doorway and leaves it  there within easy reach from the gallery if ever his impulse should be strong  enough to lead him to make an attempt at striking a feather from the Indian  headdress on the other side of the court. You think him mad. So do I, but  dreams are filled with that kind of madness; and when I see him shut the door  upon this bow, and steal back without relocking it or the one below, I have no  other excuse than this to give in answer to your criticisms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not criticise; I listen, Sweetwater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will criticise now. As Bunyan says in his &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rsquo;: &lsquo;I dreamed  again!&rsquo; This time I saw the museum proper. It was filled with visitors. The  morning of May twenty-second was a busy one, I am told, and a whole lot of  people, singly and in groups, were continually passing up and down the marble  steps and along the two galleries. Partaking of the feelings of the one whose  odd impulses I am endeavoring to describe, I was very uneasy and very restless  until these crowds had thinned and most of the guests vanished from the  building. The hands of the clock were stealing toward twelve&mdash;the hour of  greatest quiet and fewest visitors. As it reached the quarter mark, I saw what  I was looking for, the man X reaching for one of those arrows hanging in the  southern gallery, and slipping it inside his coat.&mdash;Did you speak, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No,  Mr. Gryce had not spoken; and Sweetwater, after an interval of uncertainty,  went quietly on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I saw both of his hands quite free the next minute, I judge that something had  been attached to the lining of that coat to hold the arrow by its feathered  head. But this is a deduction rather than a fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stopped abruptly. An exclamation&mdash;one of Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s very own&mdash;had left that  gentleman&rsquo;s lips, and Sweetwater felt that he must pause if only for an  instant, to enjoy his small triumph. But the delay was short.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; said Mr. Gryce; and Sweetwater obeyed, but in lowered tones as though the  vision he was describing was actually before his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next,  I see a sweep of tapestry, and an eager, peering figure passing slowly across  it. It is that of the love-lorn Travis watching his inamorata tripping up the  marble staircase and turning at its top in the direction of the opposite  gallery. His is a timid soul, and anxious as he is to watch her, he is not at  all anxious to be detected in the act of doing so. So he slips behind the huge  pedestal towering near him, thus causing the whole gallery to appear empty to  the eyes of X, now entering it at the other end. This latter has come there  with but one idea in his head&mdash;to shoot an arrow across the court at the mark I  have mentioned. It may have been on a dare&mdash;sometimes I think it was; but shoot  it he means to, before a fresh crowd collects.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  already has, as you will remember, the arrow hidden somewhere about his person,  and it is only a few steps to the edge of the tapestry behind which he has  secreted the bow. If he takes a look opposite, it is at the moment when both  Mrs. Taylor and Miss Willetts are screened from his view by one of the  partitions separating the various sections. For unless he felt the way to be  free for his arrow, he would never have proceeded to slip behind his chosen  pedestal, secure the bow, pause to string it, then crouch for his aim in such  apparent confidence. For after he has left the open gallery and limited his  outlook to what is visible beyond the loophole through which he intends to  shoot, he can see&mdash;as we know from Mr. La Fl&egrave;che&mdash;little more than the spot where  the cap hangs and the one narrow line between. Unhappily, it was across this  line the young girl leaped just as the arrow left the bow. Don&rsquo;t you see it,  sir? I do; and I see what follows, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  escape of X?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Inadvertently, as you see, he has committed a horrible crime; he can never  recall it. Whatever his remorse or shame, nothing will ever restore the victim  of his folly to life, while he himself has many days before him&mdash;days which  would be ruined if his part in this tragedy were known. Shall he confess to it,  then, or shall he fly (the way is so easy), and leave it to fate to play his  game&mdash;fate, whose well-known kindness to fools would surely favor him? It does  not take long for such thoughts to pass through a man&rsquo;s head, and before the  dying cry of his innocent victim had ceased to echo through those galleries, he  is behind the tapestry and on his way toward the court. Beyond that, my dream  does not go. How about yours, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dream was of a crime, not of an accident. No man could be such a fool as you  have made out this X of yours to be. Only an extraordinary purpose or some  imperious necessity could drive a man to shoot an arrow across an open court  where people were passing hither and yon, even if he didn&rsquo;t see anyone in the  gallery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  which you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  he had already marked the approach of his victim and was ready with his weapon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are undoubtedly right, and I only wish to say this: that the purpose in my  relation was merely to show the method and manner of this shooting, leaving <i>you</i> to put on the emphasis of crime if you saw fit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  gravity with which Mr. Gryce received this suggestion had the effect of  slightly embarrassing Sweetwater. Yet he presently ventured to add after a  moment of respectful waiting:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know that after I woke from my dream I had a moment&rsquo;s doubt as to its  accuracy on one point? The bow was undoubtedly flung behind the curtain, but  the man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused abruptly. A morsel of clean white paper had just been pushed across the  table under his eyes, and a peremptory voice was saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Write  me his name. I will do the same for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XIV"></a><b>XIV<br>
    A Loop Of Silk</b></h2>
  <p>Sweetwater  hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very fond of the one of your own choosing,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;but if you insist&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce was already writing.</p>
  <p>In  another moment the two slips were passed in exchange across the table.</p>
  <p>Instantly,  a simultaneous exclamation left the lips of both.</p>
  <p>Each  read a name he was in no wise prepared to see. They had been following  diverging lines instead of parallel ones; and it took some few minutes for them  to adjust themselves to this new condition.</p>
  <p>Then  Mr. Gryce spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  led you into loading up Correy with an act which to accept as true would oblige  us to deny every premise we have been at such pains to establish?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;and  I hope you will pardon me, Mr. Gryce, since our conclusions are so different&mdash;I  found it easier to attribute this deed of folly&mdash;or crime, if we can prove it  such&mdash;to a man young in years than to one old enough to know better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good; that is undoubtedly an excellent reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  this was said with an accent we will for want of a better word call <i>dry</i>,  Sweetwater, hardy as he was, flushed to his ears. But then any prick from Mr.  Gryce went very deep with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  he ventured, &ldquo;you will give even less indulgence to what I have to add in way  of further excuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have to hear it first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Correy  is a sport, an incorrigible one; it is his only weakness. He bets like an  Englishman&mdash;not for the money, for the sums he risks are small, but for the love  of it&mdash;the fun&mdash;the transient excitement It might be&rdquo;&mdash;here Sweetwater&rsquo;s words  came slowly and with shamefaced pauses&mdash;&ldquo;that the shooting of that arrow&mdash;I  believe I said something like this before&mdash;was the result of a dare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  halt took place in the quick tattoo which Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s fingers were drumming out  on the table-top. It was infinitesimal in length, but it gave Sweetwater  courage to add:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  I hear that he wishes to marry a rich girl and shrinks from proposing to her on  account of his small salary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has that got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  so far as I can see. I am only elaborating the meager report lying there under  your hand. But I recognize my folly. You ordered me to dream, and I did so.  Cannot we forget my unworthy vaporings and enter upon the consideration of what  may prove more profitable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  he glanced down at the slip of paper he himself held&mdash;the slip which Mr. Gryce  had handed him with a single word written on it, and that word a name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a moment,&rdquo; was Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;First explain to me how, with the facts all  in mind, and your chart before your eyes, you reconciled Correy&rsquo;s position on  the side staircase two minutes after the shooting with your theory of a quick  escape to the court by means of the door back of the tapestry? Haven&rsquo;t you  hurried matters to get him so far in such a short space of time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gryce, I have heard you say yourself that this question of time has been, from  the first, our greatest difficulty. Even with these three means of escape in  our minds, it is difficult to see how it was possible for anyone to get from  the gallery to the court in the minute or so elapsing between the cry of the  dying girl and the appearance at her side of the man studying coins in the  adjoining section.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right. There was a delay somewhere, as we shall find later on. But granting  this delay, a man would have to move fast to go the full length of the court  from the Curator&rsquo;s room even in the time which this small delay might afford  him. But perhaps you cut this inextricable knot by locating Correy somewhere  else than where he placed himself at the making of the chart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I cut it in another way. You remember my starting to tell you just now how, in  my dissatisfaction with a certain portion of my dream, I refused to believe in  the escape of my Mr. X by the way of the Curator&rsquo;s office. The tapestry was  lifted, the bow flung behind, but the man stepped back instead of forward. An  open flight along the gallery commended itself more to him than the doubtful  one previously arranged for. If you will accept that for fact, which of course  you will not, it is easy to see how Correy might have been somewhere on that  staircase when the inspiration came to turn the appearance of flight into a  show of his own innocence, by a quick rush back into the further gallery and a  consequent loud-mouthed alarm. But I see that I am but getting deeper and  deeper in the quagmire of a bad theory badly stated. I am forgetting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Many  things, Sweetwater. I will only mention a very simple one. The man who shot the  arrow wore gloves. You wouldn&rsquo;t attribute any such extraordinary precaution as  that to a fellow shooting an arrow across the court on a dare?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wouldn&rsquo;t expect it, sir. But in going about the museum that afternoon, I came  upon Correy&rsquo;s coat hanging on its peg. In one of its pockets was a pair of kid  gloves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say the fellow is courting a rich girl,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Gryce. &ldquo;Under those  circumstances some show of vanity is excusable. Certainly he would not carry  his folly so far as to put on gloves for the shooting match with which you  credit him, unless there was criminal intent back of his folly&mdash;which, of  course, would be as hard for you as for me to believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  winced, but noting the kindly twinkle with which Mr. Gryce softened the  bitterness of this lesson, he brightened again and listened with becoming  patience as the old man went on to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  discuss probabilities in connection with this other name seems futile this  morning. The ease with which one can twist the appearances of things to fit a  preconceived theory as exemplified by the effort you have just made warns us to  be chary of pushing one&rsquo;s idea too far without the firmest of bases to support  it. If you find a man&rsquo;s coat showing somewhere on its lining evidences that  there had once been sewed to it a loop of the exact dimensions of the one I  passed over to you last night, I should consider it a much more telling clue to  the personality of X than a pair of gloves in the pocket of a man who in all  probability intends to finish up the day with a call on the girl he admires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand.&rdquo; Sweetwater was quite himself again. &ldquo;But do you know that this is  no easy task you are giving me, Mr. Gryce. Where a man has but two coats, or  three at best, it might not be so hard, perhaps, to get at them. But some men  have a dozen, and if I don&rsquo;t mistake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater,  I meant to give you a task of no little difficulty. It will keep you out of  mischief.&rdquo;</p>

    News From France</b></h2>
  <p>For  the next three days the impatience of the public met with nothing but  disappointment. The police were reticent,&mdash;more reticent far than usual,&mdash;and the  papers, powerless to add to the facts already published, had little but  conjectures to offer.</p>
  <p>The  hunt for Madame Duclos continued, joined in now by the general public. But for  all the efforts made, aided by a careful search through her entire baggage,  there was as little known concerning her as on the morning of her  disappearance.</p>
  <p>Nor  did any better success follow the exhibition at the morgue of the poor little  victim&rsquo;s innocent body. The mystery covering the whole affair seemed to be  impenetrable, and the rush made on the museum upon its first reopening to the  public was such as to lead to its being closed again till some limit could be  put upon the attendance.</p>
  <p>And  thus matters stood when one morning the country was startled, and the keenest  interest again aroused in this remarkable case, by an announcement received  from France to the effect that the young lady so unfortunately killed in one of  the public buildings in New York City was, from the description sent, not the  ward of the woman Antoinette Duclos, but her own child, Angeline Duclos. That  the two were well known in St. Pierre sur Loire, where they had lived for many  years in the relationship mentioned. At the convent where she was educated, she  had been registered under the name of Duclos&mdash;also at the hotel where she and  her mother had spent a few days before leaving for England. Though of pure  French descent, the father being a Breton, they could not furnish her  birth-certificate, as she had not been born in France. According to the records  to be seen at the convent, the father, Achille Duclos, was a professor of  languages, whom her mother had met in England and married in France before  going to the States. So far as known, their story was a simple one, affording  no reason, so far as could be learned, for any change of name on the part of  the young woman, in her visit to America.</p>
  <p>This  was supplemented by a word from Scotland Yard, England, received a few hours  after the other, to the effect that Madame Duclos and Miss Willetts arrived at  the Ritz from Dover, on the morning of May 16th, and left the next morning for  Southampton. They spent the evening at the theater with friends who called for  them in a public automobile. These people had not been found, but they had been  advertised for and might yet show up. Nothing more could be learned of either  of them.</p>
  <p>Now  here was an astonishing discovery! That two women known and recognized as mother  and daughter in France should pass for unrelated companions on leaving that  country to enter ours. What were we Americans to think of this, especially in  the light of the tragic event which so soon terminated this companionship.</p>
  <p>That  the French records, imperfect as they were, were to be relied upon as stating  the truth as to the exact nature of the connection between these two, there  could be no doubt. But granting this, what fresh complexities were thus brought  into an affair already teeming with incongruities&mdash;nay, absolute contradictions.</p>
  <p>Madame  Duclos&rsquo; conduct, as shown toward her young charge, had seemed sufficiently  strange and inconsistent when looked upon as that of governess or guardian. But  for a mother, and a French mother at that, to allow a young and inexperienced  girl to go alone to a strange museum on the very day of their arrival, and  then, with or without knowledge of what had happened to her there, to efface  herself by flight without promise of return, was inconceivable to anyone acquainted  with the most ordinary of French conventions.</p>
  <p>Some  sinister secret, despite the seeming harmlessness of their lives, must hide  behind such unnatural conduct! Was it one connected with or entirely  dissociated from the tragedy which had terminated the poor child&rsquo;s existence?  This was the great question. This was what gave new zest to the search for the  dark-skinned Frenchwoman, with her drooping eyelid and hesitating walk, and led  Sweetwater to whisper into Gryce&rsquo;s ear, as they stepped out that same day from  Headquarters:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more nonsense now. We must find that woman or her dead body before the next  twenty-four hours have elapsed. With our fingers on that end of the string&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will get hold of some family secret, but not of the immediate one which especially  concerns us. Madame Duclos sent her daughter unattended to the museum, but she  did not direct the shaft which killed her. That was the work of our friend X.  Let us then make sure that we fit the right man to this algebraic symbol, and  trust to her testimony to convict him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time they had reached the taxi which was to convey Mr. Gryce home. But  though Sweetwater lent his arm to help the old man in, he did it with such an  air of hesitation that it caused the other to remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not ended your argument. There is something more you want to say. What is  it? Speak up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no. I am quite satisfied, so far as the Duclos matter is concerned. It is  only&mdash;would you mind stepping aside for a moment till I tell you a bit of gossip  which has just come to my ears? Thank you, sir. Forbes is all right&rdquo; (Forbes  was the chauffeur), &ldquo;but confidences are sacred and this thing was told me in  confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  humorous twist of his features as he said this quite transformed his very plain  countenance. Mr. Gryce, noting it, began to stare at the first isolated object  handy, which in this case happened to be the crooked end of his umbrella&mdash;a  sign, to those who knew him well, of awakened interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?  Let&rsquo;s hear,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t sound like much; but it will probably be news to you, as it certainly  was to me. It&rsquo;s this, Mr. Gryce: A certain gentleman we know has been  contemplating matrimony; but since this accident happened at the museum,&mdash;that  is, within the last two days,&mdash;the engagement has been broken off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!  But I thought he had not got so far as an engagement. You mean young Correy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Gryce, I do not. I mean&mdash;<i>the other</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  other! Well, that&rsquo;s worth listening to. Engaged, eh, and now all of a sudden  free again? At whose instance, Sweetwater, his or hers? Did you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly, but&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite a story, sir. I had it from his chauffeur and will tell  it to you later if you are in a hurry to go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Home!  Come back with me into Headquarters. I&rsquo;ve got to sleep to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  laughed, and together they retraced their steps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, sir,&rdquo; the young detective began as they drew their chairs together in an  unoccupied corner, &ldquo;you gave me a task the other day which called for the help  of a friend&mdash;one at court, I mean, a fellow who not only knows the gentleman but  has access to his person <i>and</i> his wardrobe. X does not keep a  man-servant&mdash;men of his intellectual type seldom do&mdash;but does own a limousine and  consequently employs a chauffeur. To meet and make this chauffeur mine took me  just two days. I don&rsquo;t know how I did it. I never know how I do it,&rdquo; he added  with a sheepish smile as Mr. Gryce gave utterance to his old-fashioned &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t flatter and I don&rsquo;t bring out my pocketbook or offer drinks or even  cigars, but I get &lsquo;em, as you know, and get &lsquo;em strong, perhaps because I don&rsquo;t  make any great effort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  an evening spent in the garage with this man, he was ready to talk, and this is  what slipped out, among a lot of nonsensical gossip. Mr. X, the real Mr. X this  time, has, besides his apartment in New York, a place on Long Island. The  latter has been recently bought and, though fine enough, is being added to and  refitted as no man at his age would take the trouble of doing, if he hadn&rsquo;t a  woman in mind. The chauffeur&mdash;Holmes is his name&mdash;is no fool, and has seen for  some time that Mr. X, for all his goings to and fro and the many calls he is in  the habit of making on a certain young lady, did not expect him&mdash;that is,  Holmes&mdash;to notice anything beyond the limits of his work, or to recognize in any  way his employer&rsquo;s secret intentions. But fortunately for us, this man Holmes  is just one of those singularly meddlesome people whose curiosity grows with  every attempt at repression; and when, coincident with that disastrous  happening at the museum, all these loverlike attentions ceased and no calls  were made and no presents sent, and gloom instead of cheer marked his employer&rsquo;s  manner, he made up his mind to sacrifice a portion of his dignity rather than  endure the fret of a mystery he did not understand. This meant not only keeping  his eyes open,&mdash;this he had always done,&mdash;but his ears as well.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  young lady, whose name he never mentioned, lives not in the city but in that  same Long Island village where Mr. X&rsquo;s country-house is in the process of  renovation. If he, Holmes, should ever be so fortunate as to be ordered to  drive there again, he knew of a gravel walk running under the balcony where the  two often sat. He would make the acquaintance of that gravel walk instead of  sitting out the hour somewhere in the rear, as he had hitherto been accustomed  to do. What&rsquo;s the use of having ears if you don&rsquo;t use them? Nobody would be any  the worse, and his mind would be at rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  do you know, sir, that he did actually carry this cowardly resolution through.  There came a night&mdash;I think it was Tuesday&mdash;when the order came, and they took  the road to Belport. Not a word did his employer utter the whole way. Solemn  and still he sat, and when they arrived he descended without a word, rang the  bell and entered the house. It was very warm, that night, Holmes said, and  before long he heard the glass doors open onto the balcony, and knew that his  wished-for chance had come. Leaving the limousine, he crept around to secure a  place among the bushes, and what he heard while there seemed to compensate him  for what he called his loss of dignity. The young girl was crying, and the man  was talking to her kindly enough but in a way to end whatever hopes she may  have had.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holmes  heard him say: &lsquo;It cannot be, now. Circumstances have changed for me lately,  and much as I regret it I must ask you to be so good as to forgive me for  giving up our plans.&rsquo; Then he offered her money,&mdash;an annuity, I believe they  call it,&mdash;but she cried out at that, saying it was love she wanted, to be petted  and cared for&mdash;money she could do without. When he showed himself again in  front, he was stiffer and more solemn than ever, and said &lsquo;Home,&rsquo; in a dreary  way which made the chauffeur feel decidedly uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course Holmes is quite blind to what this all means, but you may possibly see  some connection between this sudden act of sacrifice on X&rsquo;s part and the work  of the arrow. At all events, I thought you ought to know that Mr. X&rsquo;s closet  holds a skeleton which he will doubtless take every pains to keep securely  locked from general view. Holmes says that his last word to the disappointed  girl was in the way of warning. No mention of this break in their plans was to  be made without his sanction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  work, Sweetwater! You have strengthened my hands wonderfully. Does this fellow  Holmes know you for a police-detective?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  not, sir. That would be fatal to our friendship, I am sure. I haven&rsquo;t even let  him discover that what he was burning to tell had any especial interest for me.  I let him ramble on with just a word here and there to show I wasn&rsquo;t bored. He  hasn&rsquo;t an idea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Now, what do you propose to do next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  take up my residence in Belport.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  Belport?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  X proposes to move there, bag and baggage, this very week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  his house is done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He hates the city. Wants to have an eye to the changes being made. Perhaps he  thinks a little work of this kind may distract him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  a master carpenter once, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  have a friend on the spot who promises to recommend me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  workmen wanted there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  good one, very much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure you&rsquo;ll fill the bill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall try to, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  for the risk you run of being recognized, I should bet on you, Sweetwater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; people will not forget the unfortunate shape of my nose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were up and down the museum for hours. He must know your face like a book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t be helped, I shall keep out of sight as much as possible whenever he is  around. I am an expert workman in the line wanted. I understand my trade, and  he will see that I do and doubt his eyes rather than stretch probabilities to  the point of connecting me with the Force. Besides, I get quite another  expression when my hands get in touch with the wood; and I can look a man in  the eye, if I have to, without a quiver of self-consciousness. His will drop  before mine will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  name as carpenter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jacob  Shott. It&rsquo;s the name by which Holmes already knows me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well, the game may be worth the candle. You can soon tell. I will keep you posted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  rest was business with which we need not concern ourselves.</p>

    Friends</b></h2>
  <p>A  shaded walk, with a glimpse of sea beyond, embowering trees, a stretch of lawn  on one side, and on the other the dormer windows of a fine old house half  hidden by scaffolding, from which there came now and then the quick strokes of  a workman&rsquo;s hammer.</p>
  <p>It  was half-past four, if the sharp little note of a cuckoo-clock, snapping out  one, told the time correctly.</p>
  <p>Two  men are pacing this leafy retreat, both of whom we have seen before, but under  circumstances so distracting that we took little note of their appearance, fine  as it undoubtedly was in either case. However, we are more at leisure now, and  will pause for an instant to give you some idea of these two prominent men,  with one of whom our story will henceforth have very much to do.</p>
  <p>One  of them&mdash;the Curator of our famous museum&mdash;lacks comeliness of figure, though at  moments he can be very impressive. We can therefore recognize him at a distance  by means of a certain ungainliness of stride sometimes seen in a man wholly  given over to intellectual pursuits. But when he turns and you get a glimpse of  his face, you experience at once the scope of mind and charm of spirit which  make his countenance a marked one in the metropolis. A little gray about the  temples, a tendency&mdash;growing upon him, alas!&mdash;to raise his hand to his ear when  called upon to listen, show that he has already passed the meridian of life;  but in his quick glance, and clear and rapid speech, youth still lingers,  making of him a companion delightful to many and admirable to all.</p>
  <p>The  other&mdash;Carleton Roberts, his bosom friend, and the museum&rsquo;s chief director&mdash;is of  a different type, but no less striking to the eye. For him, personality has done  much toward raising him to his present status among the leading men of New  York. While not tall, he is tall enough never to look short, owing to the trim  elegance of his figure and the quiet dignity of his carriage. He does not need  to turn his face to impress you with the idea that he is handsome; but when he  does so, you find that your expectations are more than met by the reality. For  though he may not have the strictly regular features we naturally associate  with one of his poise and matchless outline, there is enough of that quality,  and more than enough of that additional elusive something which is an  attraction in itself, to make for handsomeness in a marked degree. He, like his  friend, has passed his fortieth year, but nowhere save in his abundant locks  can one see any sign of approaching age. They are quite white&mdash;cut close, but  quite white, so white they attracted the notice of his companion, who stole  more than one look at them as he chatted on in what had become almost a  monologue, so little did Roberts join in the conversation.</p>
  <p>Finally  the Curator paused, and stealing another look at that white head, remarked  anxiously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you not grown gray very suddenly? I don&rsquo;t remember your being whiter than  myself the day I dined with you just preceding the horrible occurrence at the  museum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been growing gray for a year,&rdquo; rejoined the other. &ldquo;My father was white at  forty; I am just forty-three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  becomes you, and yet&mdash;Roberts, you have taken this matter too much to heart. We  were not to blame in any way, unless it was in having such deadly weapons  within reach. How could one suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  how could one suppose!&rdquo; echoed the director. &ldquo;And the mystery of it! The police  seem no nearer solving the problem now than on the night they practised archery  in the galleries. It does wear on me, possibly because I live so much alone. I  see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  he stopped abruptly. They had been strolling in the direction of the house, and  at this moment were not many paces from it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  what?&rdquo; urged the Curator with an accent one might almost call tender&mdash;would have  been called tender, if used in addressing a woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See <i>her</i>, that dead girl!&mdash;constantly&mdash;at night when my eyes are shut&mdash;in the  daytime while I go about my affairs, here, there and everywhere. The young,  young face! so white, so still, so strangely and so unaccountably familiar! Do  you feel the same? Did she remind you of anyone we know? I grow old trying to  place her. I can say this to you; but not to another soul could I speak of what  has become to me a sort of blind obsession. She was a stranger. I know of no  Madame Duclos and am sure that I never saw her young daughter before; and yet I  have started up in my bed more than once during these past few nights,  confident that in another moment memory would supply the clue which will rid my  mind of the eternal question as to where I have seen a face like hers before?  But memory fails to answer; and the struggle, momentarily interrupted, begins  again, to the destruction of my peace and comfort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Odd!  but you must rid yourself of what unnerves you so completely. It does no good  and only adds to regrets which are poignant enough in themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true; but&mdash;stop a minute. I see it now&mdash;her face, I mean. It comes between me  and the house there. Even your presence does not dispel it. It is&mdash;no, it&rsquo;s gone  again. Let us go back once more and take another look at the sea. It is the one  thing which draws me away from this pursuing vision.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  resumed their stroll, this time away from the house and toward the oval cut in  the trees for a straight view out to the sea. Across this oval a ship was now  sailing which attracted the eyes of both; not till it had passed, did the  Curator say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  live too lonely a life. You should seek change&mdash;recreation&mdash;possibly something  more absorbing than either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Roberts, I do. Pardon me; I want to see your eye beam again with contentment.  The loss of your late companion has left you desolate, more desolate than you  have been willing to acknowledge. You cannot replace her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am wedded to politics.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  untrustworthy jade. When did politics ever make a man happy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happy!&rdquo;  They were turned toward the house again. When near, Roberts capped his  exclamation with the remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ask a great deal for me, more than you ask for yourself. You have not married  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  my mistress is not a jade. I find joy in my work. I have not had time to woo a  woman as she should be wooed if she&rsquo;s to be a happy second wife. I should have  so much to explain to her. When I get looking over prints, the dinner-bell  might ring a dozen times without my hearing it. A letter from an agent telling  of some wonderful find in Mesopotamia would make me forget whether my wife&rsquo;s  hair were brown or black. I don&rsquo;t need diversion, Roberts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you enjoy a couple of hours in the country, a whiff of fresh air&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a chat with a friend. Yes, I do; but if the museum were open&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Roberts smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that you are incorrigible.&rdquo; Then, with a gesture toward the house: &ldquo;Come  and see my new veranda. Its outlook will surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  you have already surmised, he was the owner of this place; and the man for  whose better understanding Sweetwater had again taken up the plane and the  hammer.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XVII"></a><b>XVII<br>
    The Cuckoo-Clock</b></h2>
  <p>As  they made their way through scattered timber and the litter of fresh  carpentry-work, the man who was busy there and who certainly had outstayed his  time took up his kit and disappeared around the corner of the house. Neither  noted him. The cuckoo-clock was chirping out its five small notes from the cheerful  interior, and the Curator was remarking upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a merry sound both sweet and stimulating; and what is still better, I can hear  it without effort. I believe I should like to have a clock of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  goes where I go,&rdquo; muttered its strange owner with what seemed an involuntary  emphasis. Then as the Curator turned upon him in some surprise, he added with  studied indifference: &ldquo;I brought it from Switzerland when I was younger than I  am now&mdash;a silly memento, but I fancy it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  commonplace explanation surely; why, then, did that same workman, who had  stopped short after rounding the corner to pick up something which he as  quickly threw down, turn a quick head and listen eagerly for what might be said  next. Nothing came of it, for the veranda door was near and the two gentlemen  had stepped in; but to one who knew Sweetwater, the smile with which he resumed  his work had an element in it which, if seen, would have darkened still further  the gloom in the troubled eye of the speaker.</p>
  <p>Switzerland!  He had said Switzerland.</p>
  <p>It  was not long after this that the Curator and his host left for New York.</p>
  <p>The  house was not quite ready for occupancy, but was in the process of being made  so by the woman who had done duty as housekeeper for Mr. Roberts both before  his marriage and since his wife&rsquo;s death. During the fifteen years which had  intervened, she had been simply the cook.</p>
  <p>This  woman, Huldah Weston by name, did not accompany them. She was in Belport to  stay, and as it behooves us to remain there for a while longer ourselves, we  will join her in the quiet rest she is taking on the kitchen steps before  shutting up the house for the night.</p>
  <p>She  is not alone. A young man is with her&mdash;one to whom she is giving temporary board  and lodging in exchange for the protection of his presence and such slight help  as he can afford her in the heavy task of distributing and arranging the  furniture.</p>
  <p>We  know this man. It is the one we have just seen halting at the corner of the  house, on quitting his work on the new veranda&mdash;Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>He  is a genial soul; she, though very old for the responsibilities she still  insists upon carrying, enjoys a good laugh. Nor is she averse to the numberless  little kindly attentions with which he shows his respect for her age if not a  personal liking for herself. In short, they are almost friends, and she trusts  him as she has never trusted any young man yet, save the boy she lost when she  was still a comely widow.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  this is why, on this night when we find the two together, he ventures to turn  the talk upon the man she had so devotedly served during the better part of her  life.</p>
  <p>He  began with the cuckoo-clock. Where did it come from? How long had they had it?  What a jolly little customer the wee bird was, darting out and darting in with  his hurry-call to anyone who would listen! It made a fellow feel ashamed to  dawdle at his work. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to let any mere bird get ahead of him&mdash;a  wooden bird at that!</p>
  <p>He  got her talking. She had known Mr. Roberts&rsquo; mother, and she had been in the  house (a young girl then) when he went away to Europe. He had not wanted to go.  He was in love, or thought he was, with a woman older than himself. But the  mother did not approve of the match, though the lady had a mint of money and  everything in her favor but those seven years. She afterward became his wife  and for all his mother&rsquo;s fears they lived together very happily. Since her  death which occurred about a year ago he&rsquo;s been a different man; very sad and  much given to sitting alone. Anyone can see the effect it has had upon him if  they look at him closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was a good woman, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  life must be lonesome for a widower, especially if he has no children. But  perhaps he has some married or at school?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he has no children, and no relations, to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he brought that clock from Switzerland? Did he ever say from what part of  Switzerland?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he did, I don&rsquo;t remember; I&rsquo;ve no memory for foreign names.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  sent Sweetwater off on another tack. He knew such a good story, which, having  told, he seemed to have forgotten all about the clock, for he said nothing more  about it, and not much more about Mr. Roberts.</p>
  <p>But  when, a little later, he followed her into that gentleman&rsquo;s room for the  purpose of unlocking a trunk which had been delivered that day, he took  advantage of her momentary absence in search of the key to pull out that  cuckoo-clock from the wall where it hung and read the small slip of paper  pasted across its back. As he hoped, it gave both the name and address of the  merchant from whom it had been bought. But that was not all. Running in  diagonal lines across this label, he saw some faded lines in fine handwriting,  which proved to be a couplet signed with five initials. The latter were not  quite legible, but the couplet he could read without the least difficulty. It  was highly sentimental, and might mean much and might mean nothing. If the  handwriting should prove to be Mr. Roberts&rsquo;, the probabilities were in favor of  the former supposition&mdash;or so he said to himself, as he swung the clock back  into place.</p>
  <p>When  Mrs. Weston returned, he was standing as patiently as possible in the middle of  the room, saying over and over to himself to insure remembrance till he could  jot the lines down in his notebook: <i>Bossberg, Lucerne.... I love but thee&mdash;and  thee will I love to eternity.</i></p>
  <p>His  interest in this slight and doubtful clue, however, sank into insignificance  when, having unlocked and unstrapped the trunk which Mrs. Weston pointed out,  he saw to his infinite satisfaction that it held Mr. Roberts&rsquo; clothing&mdash;the one  thing in the world toward which at this exact moment his curiosity mainly  pointed. If only he might help her handle the heavy coats which lay so  temptingly on top! Should he propose to do so? Looking at her firm chin and  steady eye, he felt that he did not dare. To rouse the faintest suspicion in  this woman&rsquo;s intelligent mind would be fatal to all further procedure, and so  he stood indifferent, while she lifted garment after garment and laid them  carefully on the bed. He counted five coats and as many vests&mdash;and was racking  his brains for some plausible excuse for a nearer inspection, when she stopped  in the midst of her work, with the cheery remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will do for to-night. To-morrow I will look them all over for moths before  hanging them away in the closet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  he had to go, leaving them lying there within reach of his hand, when one  glance at the lining of a certain coat which had especially attracted his eye  might have given him the one clue he most needed.</p>
  <p>The  room which had been allotted to him in this house was in the rear and at the  top of a steep flight of stairs. As he sought it that night, he cast a quick  glance through the narrow passageway opening just beyond his own door. Would it  be possible for him to thread those devious ways and reach Mr. Roberts&rsquo; room  without rousing Mrs. Weston, who in spite of her years had the alertness of a  watchdog with eye and ear ever open? To be found strolling through quarters  where he had no business would be worse than being suspected of taking a  personal interest in the owner&rsquo;s garments. He was of an adventurous turn, and  ever ready to risk something on the turn of a die, but not too much. A false  move might hazard all; besides, he remembered the airing these clothes were to  get and the nearness of the clothes-yard to the pump he so frequently  patronized, and all the chances which this gave for an inspection which would  carry little danger to one of his ready wit.</p>
  <p>So  he gave up the midnight search he might have attempted under other circumstances,  and shut his room from the moon and his eyes to sleep, and dreamed. Was it of  the great museum, with its hidden mystery enshrouding its many wonders of high  art, or of a far-off time and a far-off scene, where in the stress of some  great emotion the trembling hand of Carleton Roberts had written on the back of  this foolish clock for which he still retained so great a fancy the couplet  which he himself had so faithfully memorized:</p>
  <p>I  love but thee, And thee will I love to eternity. </p>
  <p>At  eight o&rsquo;clock on the following morning the quick strokes of the workman&rsquo;s  hammer reawakened the echoes at the end of the building where the big enclosed  veranda was going up.</p>
  <p>As  the clock struck nine Mrs. Weston could be seen hanging up her master&rsquo;s coats  and trousers on a long line stretched across the clothes-yard. They remained  there two hours, viewed from afar by Sweetwater, but not approached till he saw  the old woman disappear from one of the gates with a basket on her arm. Then he  developed thirst and went rearward to the pump. While there, he took a look at  the sea. A brisk wind was springing up. It gave him an idea.</p>
  <p>Making  sure that his fellow workmen were all busy, he loosened one end of the line  holding the fluttering garments and then went back to his work. As the wind  increased, the strain on the line became too great, and soon he had the  satisfaction of seeing the whole thing fall in one wild flap to the ground.  With an exclamation calculated to draw the attention of the men about him to  what had happened, he rushed to the rescue, lifted the line and rearranged the  clothes. Then refastening&mdash;this time securely&mdash;the end of the line which had  slipped loose, he returned to his post, with just one quick and disappointed  look thrown back at the now safe if wildly fluttering garments.</p>
  <p>He  had improved his opportunity to examine the inside of every coat and had found  nothing to reward his scrutiny. But it was not this which had given him his  chief annoyance. It was the fact that the one coat from which he had expected  the anticipated clue&mdash;the coat which Mr. Roberts had certainly worn on that  tragic day at the museum&mdash;was not there. A summer overcoat had filled out the  number, and his investigation was incomplete.</p>
  <p>Why  was that one coat lacking? He was sure he had seen it the night before lying on  the bed with the others. Was it still there, or had it been stowed away in  drawer or closet, irrespective of its danger from moths, for a reason he would  give his eyeteeth to know but dared not inquire into till he had clinched his  friendship with this old woman so thoroughly that he could ask her  anything&mdash;which certainly was not the case as yet.</p>
  <p>The  absence of the one coat he wanted most to see afflicted him sorely. He told  Mrs. Weston, on her return, how the line had fallen and how he had replaced it,  but for all his wits, he could not get any further. With the close of the day&rsquo;s  work and the reappearance of Mr. Roberts, he slipped away to the village, to  avoid an encounter of the results of which he felt very doubtful. His dinner  would not be ready till after Mr. Roberts had been served, and the three hours  which must necessarily elapse before that happy moment looked very long and  very unproductive to him, especially as he had found no answer as yet to the  question which so grievously perplexed him.</p>
  <p>He  had paced the main street twice and had turned into a narrow lane ending in the  smallest of gardens and the most infinitesimal of houses, when the door of this  same house opened and a man came out whose appearance held him speechless for a  moment&mdash;then sent him forward with a quickly beating heart. It was not the man  himself that produced this somewhat startling effect; it was his clothes. So  far as his hat and nether garments went, they were, if not tattered, not very  far from it; but the coat he wore was not only trim but made of the finest  cloth and without the smallest sign of wear. It was so conspicuously fine, and  looked so grotesquely out of place on the man wearing it, that he could pass no  one without rousing curiosity, and he probably had all he wanted to do for the  next few days in explaining how a fine gentleman&rsquo;s coat had fallen to his lot.</p>
  <p>But  to Sweetwater its interest lay in something more important than the amusing  incongruity it offered to the eye. It looked exactly like the one belonging to  Mr. Roberts which had escaped his scrutiny in so remarkable a way. Should it  prove to be that same, how fortunate he was to have it brought thus easily  within his reach and under circumstances so natural it was not necessary for  him to think twice how best to take advantage of them.</p>
  <p>Father  Dobbins&mdash;for that is the name by which this old codger was known to the  boys&mdash;was, as might be expected, very proud of his new acquisition and quite  blind to the contrast it offered to his fringed-out trouser-legs. He had a  smile on his face which broadened as he caught Sweetwater&rsquo;s sympathetic glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine  day,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Are ye wantin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; of me that ye&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; this way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  and perhaps,&rdquo; answered Sweetwater, &ldquo;&mdash;if that fine coat I see you wearing is the  one given you by Mrs. Weston up the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Deed,  sir, and what&rsquo;s amiss? She gave it to me, yes. Came all the way into the  village to find me and give it to me. Too small for her master, she said; and  would I take it to oblige him. Does she want it back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no&mdash;not she. She&rsquo;s not that kind. It&rsquo;s only that she has since remembered that  one of the pockets has a hole in it&mdash;an inside one, I believe. She&rsquo;s afraid it  might lose you a dime some day. Will you let me see if she is right? If so, I was  to take you to the tailor&rsquo;s and have it fixed immediately. I am to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man stared in slow comprehension; then with the deliberation which  evidently marked all his movements, he slowly put down his basket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  warrant ye it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But look, an ye will. I don&rsquo;t want to  lose no dimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  threw back one side of the coat, then the other, felt in the pockets and  smiled. But Gryce, and not ignorant Father Dobbins, should have seen that  smile. There was comedy in it, and there was the deepest tragedy also; for the  marks of stitches forcibly cut were to be seen under one of the  pockets&mdash;stitches which must have held something as narrow as an umbrella-band  and no longer than the little strip at which Mr. Gryce had been looking one  night in a melancholy little short of prophetic.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XVIII"></a><b>XVIII<br>
    Mrs. Davis&rsquo; Strange Lodger</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will look carefully at this chart, and note where the various persons then  in the museum were standing at the moment Correy shouted his alarm, you will  see that of all upon whom suspicion can with any probability be attached there  is but one who could have fulfilled the conditions of escape as just explained  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stretching  forth an impressive finger, Mr. Gryce pointed to a certain number on the chart  outspread between him and the Chief Inspector.</p>
  <p>He  looked&mdash;saw the number &ldquo;3&rdquo; and glanced anxiously down at the name it prefigured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Roberts&mdash;the  director! Impossible! Not to be considered for a moment. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re  getting old, Gryce.&rdquo; And he looked about to be sure that the door was quite  shut.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce smiled, a little drearily perhaps, as he acknowledged this self-evident  fact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right, Chief: I am getting old&mdash;but not so old as to venture upon so  shocking an insinuation against a man of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; repute and seeming honor,  if I had not some very substantial proofs to offer in its support.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, no doubt; but it won&rsquo;t do. I tell you, Gryce, it won&rsquo;t do. There cannot  be any such far-fetched and ridiculous explanation to the crime you talk about.  Why, he&rsquo;s next to being the Republican nominee for Senator. An attack upon him,  especially of this monstrous character, would be looked upon as a clear case of  political persecution. And such it would be, and nothing less; and it would be  all to no purpose, I am sure. I hope you are alone in these conclusions&mdash;that  you have not seen fit to share your ideas on this subject with any of the boys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  with Sweetwater, who did some of the work for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Joyce? How about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had the same opportunities as myself, but we have not reached the point of  mentioning names. I thought it best to consult with you first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  Then we&rsquo;ll drop it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was decisively said, but Gryce gave no signs of yielding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said he. Then with the dignity of long experience,  he added with quiet impressiveness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have, as you know, faced crime these many years in all its aspects. I have  tracked the ignorant, almost imbecile, murderer of the slums, and laid my hand  in arrest on the shoulder of so-called gentlemen hiding their criminal  instincts under a show of culture and sometimes of wide education. Human nature  is not so very different in high and low; and what may lead an irresponsible  dago into unsheathing his knife against his fellow may work a like effect upon  his high-bred brother if circumstances lend their aid to make discovery appear  impossible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Roberts is the friend of many a good man who would swear to his integrity with  a clear conscience. I would have sworn to it myself, a month ago, had I heard  it questioned in the slightest manner; and I may live to swear to it again,  notwithstanding the doubts which have been raised in my mind by certain strange  discoveries which link him to this unhappy affair by what we are pleased to  call circumstantial evidence. For, as I am obliged to acknowledge, the one  great thing we rely upon, in accusations of this kind, is so far lacking in his  case: I mean, the motive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know of none&mdash;can, in fact, conceive of none&mdash;which would cause a gentleman of even  life and ambitious projects to turn a deadly weapon upon an innocent child with  whom he is not, so far as we can discover, even acquainted. Dementia only can  account for such a freak, and to dementia we must ascribe this crime, if it is  necessary for us to find cause before proceeding to lay our evidence before the  District Attorney. All I propose to do at present is to show you my reasons for  thinking that the arrow which slew Angeline Willetts&mdash;or, as we have been  assured by unimpeachable authority, Angeline Duclos masquerading under the name  of Angeline Willetts&mdash;was set to bow and loosed across the court by the  gentleman we have just mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Mr. Gryce stopped for a look of encouragement from the severely silent man he  was endeavoring to impress. But he did not get it. With a full sense of his  years weighing upon him as never before, he sighed, but continued with little  change of tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the first day or two of keen surprise following an event of so many complicated  mysteries, I drew up in my own mind a list of questions which I felt should be  properly answered before I would consider it my duty to submit to you a report  to the disadvantage of any one suspect. This was Question One:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whose  was the hand to bring up into the museum gallery the bow recognized by Correy  as the one which had been lying by for an indefinite length of time in the  cellar?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  till yesterday did I get any really definite answer to this. Correy would not  talk; nor would the Curator; and I dared not press either of them beyond a  certain point, for equally with yourself, I felt it most undesirable to allow  anyone to suspect the nature of my theory or whom it especially involved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Curator had nothing to hide on this or any other point connected with the  tragedy. But it was different with Correy. He had some very strong ideas about  that visit to the cellar&mdash;only he would not acknowledge them. So yesterday,  after the satisfactory settlement of another puzzling question, I made up my  mind to trap him&mdash;which I did after this manner. He has, as most men have, in  fact, a great love for the Curator. In discussing with him the mysterious  fetching up of the bow and its subsequent concealment in the Curator&rsquo;s office,  I remarked, with a smile I did not mean to have him take as real, that only the  Curator himself would do such a thing and then forget it; that it must have  been his shadow he saw; and I begged him, in a way half jocose, half earnest,  to say so and have done with it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  worked, sir. He flushed like a man who had been struck; then he grew white with  indignation and blurted forth that it was no more his shadow than it was Mr.  Roberts&rsquo;&mdash;that indeed it was much more like Mr. Roberts&rsquo; than the Curator&rsquo;s. At  which I simply remarked: &lsquo;You think so, Correy?&rsquo; To which he replied: &lsquo;I do not  think anything. But I know that Curator Jewett never brought up that bow from  the cellar, or he would have said so the minute he saw it. There&rsquo;s no better  man in the world than he.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nor than Mr. Roberts either,&rsquo; I put in, and left  him comforted if not quite reassured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much for Question One&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Number  Two is of a similar nature. &lsquo;Was the transference of the arrow from one gallery  to the other due to the same person who brought up the bow?&rsquo; Now, in answer to  that, I have a curious thing to show you.&rdquo; And lifting into view a bundle of  goodly size, wrapped in heavy brown paper, he opened it up and disclosed a  gentleman&rsquo;s coat. Spreading this out between them lining side out, and pointing  out two marks an inch or so apart showing the remains of stitches for which  there seemed to have been no practical use, he took from his own vest-pocket  what looked like a bit of narrow black tape. This he laid down on the upturned  lining in the space bounded by the two lines of marks I have mentioned, and  drawing the Chief&rsquo;s attention to it, observed in quiet explanation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  one fits the other&mdash;stitch for stitch. Look closely at them both, I beg, and  tell me if in your judgment it is not evident that this strap or loop, or  whatever we may call it, has been cut away from this coat to which it had been  previously sewed&mdash;and by no woman either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anyone  could see that this had been so. There could be but one reply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  coat I bought from an old man to whom it had been given by Mr. Roberts&rsquo;  housekeeper on their arrival at his new home on Long Island. The strip was  picked up at the museum in the room where Mrs. Taylor spent an hour or so  immediately upon leaving the scene of crime. With her at the time was the young  lady who had kindly offered to look after her and two or three men directly  associated with the museum, of whom Mr. Roberts was one. These and these only.  Now, this strap or let us say loop, since we are beginning to see for what  purpose it was used, was not on the floor previous to the entrance of these few  persons into this room&mdash;or, indeed, for some little time afterward. Otherwise  this young lady, who was the one to open my eyes to this clue, surely would  have seen it in the half-hour she stood at Mrs. Taylor&rsquo;s side with no one to  talk to and quite free to look about her. But it <i>was</i> there after that  lady had revived from her fainting-fit&mdash;dropped, as you see&mdash;cut from its owner&rsquo;s  coat and dropped! Chief, let me ask why this should have been done in a time of  such suspense if it had had nothing to do with the crime then occupying  everybody&rsquo;s attention&mdash;a good coat too, almost new, as you will observe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Chief, possibly with a shade less of irony in his manner, answered this direct  question with one equally direct:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what connection have you succeeded in establishing between this abominable  crime and the coat with or without a loop worn by the museum&rsquo;s leading  director? One as straight and indisputable, no doubt, as that you have just  attempted to make between this same gentleman and the museum bow,&rdquo; he added  with biting incredulity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  returned the other in calm disregard of the sarcasm, &ldquo;straighter and more  indisputable, if anything. We are asking, as you will remember, how an arrow  could have been carried from the southern to the northern gallery without attracting  anyone&rsquo;s attention. I will show you how.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a rap on the table which brought Sweetwater into the room, he proceeded to pin  again into its old place on the lining of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; coat the so-called tag.  Then, taking the arrow which Sweetwater proceeded to hand him, he slipped it  into the loop thus made and showed how securely it could be held there by its  feather end.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; upright carriage might, with his coat well buttoned up,  walk the length of Broadway without disclosing the presence of this stick,&rdquo;  remarked Mr. Gryce as, at his look, Sweetwater doffed his own coat and put on  the one thus discreetly weighted.</p>
  <p>The  Chief stared, paling slightly as he noted the result. Mr. Gryce, who never  overemphasised his effects, motioned Sweetwater to leave and proceeded to the  next question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Number  Three,&rdquo; he now observed, &ldquo;should have come first, as it has already been  answered. It asks if it is possible to hit the mark in Section II of the museum&rsquo;s  gallery, from behind the pedestal in Section VIII. From the pedestal nearest  the front, <i>no</i>; but from the one further back&mdash;upon which, by the way,  Stevens found the print of a gloved finger&mdash;<i>yes</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wore gloves that day&mdash;kid gloves, mind you, for the mark of the stitching is  exact, as you can see in this print of the same made by Stevens? All the  ladies, except a young copyist who was leaving in a hurry and had not stopped  to put hers on. But of the men, only one&mdash;Mr. Roberts, the careful dresser, who  was never known to enter the street without this last touch to his toilet. How  do I know this? Look at the chart, Chief&mdash;this one which shows the court and the  persons in it at the precise minute of first alarm. You see how near the exit  Mr. Roberts was, and who was closest to him. I had a little talk&mdash;the most  guarded one imaginable&mdash;with this lady, who was the very one of whom I have just  said that she had omitted to put on her gloves; and she gave me the fact I have  just passed on to you. She noted Mr. Roberts&rsquo; hands, because they shamed hers,  and she was just stopping to pull her gloves from her coat-pocket when Correy&rsquo;s  voice rang out and everything else was forgotten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Corroborative,  only corroborative, sir? I am quite aware of that. But what I have now to add  may give it weight. The stringing of a bow is no easy task for an amateur; nor  is the discharge of an arrow, under such dangerous circumstances as marked the  delivery of the one we are discussing, one which would be lightly attempted by  a person altogether ignorant of archery. However strong the evidence might be  against a man who was not an utter fool, I would never have presumed to lay it  out before you if I had not verified the fact that the director, whatever his  life now, was once greatly addicted to sports, and thoroughly acquainted with  the management of a bow and arrow. It has taken time. Many cablegrams were  necessary, but I have at last received this copy of a report made sixteen years  ago by a club in Lucerne, Switzerland, in which mention is made of a prize  given to one Carleton Roberts, an American, for twelve piercings of the bull&rsquo;s-eye  in as many shots, in an archery-contest which included all nationalities.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  is that all. In a study of himself,&mdash;his home, his life, his secret  interests,&mdash;we come upon things which call for closer inspection. For instance,  not a day has passed since that poor child has been in the morgue that he has  not been one on the line to see her. He dreams of her, he says; he cannot get  her face out of his mind&mdash;you notice that he has been growing gray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I will stop here. I do not wonder that you look upon all this as the ravings of  a man on the verge of senility. If I were in your place, I should undoubtedly  do the same. But ungracious as the task has proved, I owed it to myself to rid  my mind of its secret burden. It is for you to say whether, all things  considered, I am to drop the matter here or proceed blindly in search of the  motive lying back of every premeditated crime. I can imagine none in this case,  as I have frankly stated, save the very weak and improbable one already  advanced by young Sweetwater in connection with another party upon whom he had  fixed his eye&mdash;that of the irresistible desire of an expert to test his skill  with a bow which comes unexpectedly into his hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  wouldn&rsquo;t apply to Roberts&mdash;not in the least,&rdquo; affirmed the Chief with the  emphasis of strong conviction. &ldquo;Even if we should allow ourselves to regard  these stray bits of circumstantial evidence as in any way conclusive of the  extraordinary theory you have advanced, he&rsquo;s much too able and cautious a man  to yield to any such fool temptation as that. But to let that matter pass for  the present: why have you paid such close attention to one end of your string,  and quite ignored the other? Madame Duclos&rsquo; hasty flight and continued absence,  in face of circumstances which would lead a natural mother to break through  every obstacle put in the way of her return, offers a field of inquiry more  promising, it appears to me, than the one upon which you have expended your  best energies. You say nothing of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to say. I am glad to leave that particular line of investigation  to you, and more than glad if it has proved or is likely to prove fruitful.  Have you heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  tossed a letter within the detective&rsquo;s grasp and leaned back while Gryce  laboriously perused it.</p>
  <p>It  was illy written, but well worth the pains he gave to it&mdash;as witness:</p>
  <p class="letter"><i>To  the Chief of Police:</i> </p>
  <p class="letter">Dear  Sir:&mdash;I am told that there is a reward out for a certain woman by the name of  Duclos. I do not know any such person, but there is a woman who has been  lodging in my house for the last two weeks who has acted so strangely at odd  times that I have become very suspicious of her, and think it right for you to  know what she did here one night.</p>
  <p class="letter">It&rsquo;s  about a fortnight since she came to my house in search of lodgings. Had she  been young, I would not have opened my doors to her, decent as she was in her  dress and ways; for she was a foreign woman and I don&rsquo;t like foreigners. But  being middle-aged and ready with her money in advance, I not only allowed her  to come in but gave her my very best room. This is not saying much, because the  elevated road runs by my door, darkening my whole front, besides making an  awful clatter. But she did not seem to mind this, and I took little notice of  her, till one of the other lodgers&mdash;a woman with a busy tongue&mdash;began to ask why  this strange woman, who was so very dark and plain, went out only at night? Did  she sew or write for a living? If not, what did she do with herself all day?</p>
  <p class="letter">As  the last was a question I could easily answer, I said that she spent most of  her time in reading the newspapers; and this was true, because she always came  in with her arms full of them. But there I stopped, as I never discuss my  lodgers. Yet I must acknowledge that my curiosity had been roused by all this  talk, and I began to watch the woman, who I soon saw was in what I would call a  flustered state of mind, and as unhappy as anyone could be who hadn&rsquo;t suffered  some great bereavement. But still I wasn&rsquo;t really alarmed, being misled by the  name she gave, which was Clery.</p>
  <p class="letter">Night  before last I went to bed early. I am a heavy sleeper, as I need to be with  those cars pounding by the house every few minutes. But there are certain  noises which wake me, and I found myself all of a sudden sitting up in bed and  listening with all my ears. Everything was quiet, even on the elevated road;  but when the next train came thundering along, I heard, piercing shrilly  through the rumble and roar, that same sharp <i>ping</i> which had wakened me.  What was it? It seemed to come from somewhere in the house. But how could that  be! I was startled enough, however, to get up and slip on some of my clothes  and stand with ears astretch for the next train.</p>
  <p class="letter">It  came and passed, and right in the middle of the noise it made I heard again  that quick, sharp sound. This time I was sure it came from somewhere near, and  opening my door, I slid out into the hall. All my lodgers were in but one, a  young gentleman who has a night-key. And most of the rooms were dark, as I can  very well tell from the fact that none of the doors fit as they ought to and  there is sure to be a streak of light showing somewhere about them if the gas  is burning inside. Everything looked so natural, and the house was so still,  that I was going back again when another train swept by and that sound was  repeated. This time I was sure it came from somewhere on the lower floor, and  mindful of Mrs. Clery&rsquo;s queer ways, I stole downstairs to her door. She was  up&mdash;that was plainly enough to be seen. But what was she doing? I was just a  little frightened, or I would have knocked on the door and asked.</p>
  <p class="letter">As  I was waiting for the passing by of the next train, my last lodger came in and  caught me standing there before Mrs. Clery&rsquo;s door. I know him pretty well; so I  put my finger to my lips and then beckoned him to join me. As the train  approached, I seized him by the arm and pointed toward Mrs. Clery&rsquo;s door. He  didn&rsquo;t know what I meant, of course, but he looked and listened, and when the  train had gone by, I drew him down the hall and said, &ldquo;You heard it!&rdquo; and then  asked him what it was. He answered that it was a pistol-shot, and he wanted to  go back to see if any dreadful thing had happened. But I shook my head and told  him it was one of five, each one taking place when the roar of the trains going  by was at the loudest. Then he said that this woman was practising at a mark,  and bade me look out or we should have a house full of anarchists. At that, I  loudly declared she should go the first thing in the morning and so got rid of  him. But I did not keep my word, and for this reason: When I went to do her  room-work as I always do immediately after breakfast, I was all smiles and full  of talk till I had taken a good look at the walls for the bullet-holes I expected  to see there. But I didn&rsquo;t find any, and was puzzled enough you may be sure,  for those bullets must have gone somewhere and I was quite certain that they  had not been fired out of the window. I hardly dared to look at the ceiling,  for she was watching me and kept me chatting and wondering till all of a sudden  I noticed that one of the sofa-pillows was missing from its place. This set me  thinking, and I was about to ask her what she had done with it when my  attention was drawn away by seeing among the scraps in the wastebasket I had  lifted to carry out the end and corner of what looked like a partly destroyed  photograph.</p>
  <p class="letter">This  was something too strange not to rouse any woman&rsquo;s curiosity, but I was careful  not to give it another glance till I was well out of the room. Then, as you may  believe, I drew it quickly out, to find that all the middle part was gone&mdash;shot  to pieces by those tearing bullets. Not a particle of the face was to be seen,  and only enough of the neck and shoulders to show that it had been the portrait  of a man. I enclose it for you to see; and if you want to talk to the woman,  she is still here, though I only keep her in the hope of her being that Madame  Duclos for whom money is offered. I will tell you why I think this: Not because  of a torn skirt,&mdash;you see I have been looking over the advertisement printed in  the papers,&mdash;but because she is foreign and dark and has a decidedly drooping  eyelid. Then too, she halts a little on one foot, as I noticed when I called  her hurriedly to the window to see something. If you want to have a look at  her, come after five and before seven; we are both in then.</p>
  <p class="letter">Yours  respectfully,</p>
  <p class="letter">Caroline  Davis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt that&rsquo;s the woman,&rdquo; commented Gryce. &ldquo;We are fortunate in hitting her  trail at this critical moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had already glanced at the mutilated photograph lying before him, but now he  took it up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  little here,&rdquo; he remarked as he examined first the face of it and then the  back. &ldquo;But if you will let me take it, I may find that its place is in our  incompleted chain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  it, and if you would like to have a talk with the woman herself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Chief; I would like that above all things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. I&rsquo;m expecting her here any minute, but&mdash;Well, what now? What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  officer had entered hurriedly after one quick knock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Davis&rsquo; lodger is gone,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Left without a word to anybody. When they  went to her room they found it empty, with a five-dollar bill pinned to the  riddled cushion. As nobody saw her go, we are as much at sea as ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smile, both curious and fine, crossed Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s lips as he listened to this,  and turning earnestly to the Chief, he begged for the job of looking her up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think with the little start we now have that I can find her,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;At all  events, I should like to try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  let the other matter rest quiescent meanwhile?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hardly know myself, Chief. All is hazy yet, but skies clear, and so do most of  our problems. If the two ends of my string should chance to come together&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here a look from his Chief stopped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us pray that they won&rsquo;t. But if they do, we shall not shirk our duty, Gryce.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XIX"></a><b>XIX<br>
    Mr. Gryce And The Timid Child</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Assurance  does it, sir&mdash;a great deal of assurance. Not that I have much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Mr. Gryce laughed, with the result that Sweetwater laughed also. A moment of  fun was a welcome relief, and they both made the most of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I lack it entirely,&rdquo; Sweetwater hastened to say. Then they laughed  again&mdash;after which their talk proceeded on serious lines.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater,  what is that you once told me about a family named Duclos?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  this, sir: There is one such family in town, as Peters discovered in looking up  the name in the directory a day or two after Madame&rsquo;s disappearance. But there&rsquo;s  nothing to be learned from them. Mr. and Mrs. Edward Duclos are a most  respectable couple and have but one answer to every question. They know no one  of their name outside their own family. Though the man of the house is Breton  born, he has lived many years in this country, and in all that time has never  met another Duclos.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Peters let it go at that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  to. What else could he do? However, he did make this admission&mdash;that there was a  child in the room who betrayed a nervousness under his questions which was not  observable in her elders, a girl of twelve or so who put her hands behind her  when she found she could not control their twitching. And I&rsquo;ve an idea that if  he could have got this child by herself, he might have heard something quite  different from the plain denial he got from the mother. I&rsquo;ve always thought so;  but I&rsquo;ve had too many other things to do to make an effort in this direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  if you approve, I&rsquo;ll see what I can do with this girl, for it stands to reason  there must be some place in town where this woman, just off ship, found an  immediate refuge and a change of clothing and effects. Nor should I be much  surprised if we should discover that she is an inmate of this very house. What  do you think, Mr. Gryce? Is it worth looking into?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is worth my looking into. I have other work for you. Where does this Duclos  family live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  told him. It was in one of the Eighties, not a quarter of a mile from the Hotel  Universal.</p>
  <p>This  settled, Mr. Gryce took from his pocket the mutilated photograph which had served  as a target to the woman in Fifty-third Street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see this,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The face is all gone; only a sweep of the hair on one  side, and a bit of collar and the tip of a shoulder on the other, remain to act  as a clue. Yet I expect you to find the negative from which this photograph was  printed. It should not be so difficult,&mdash;that is, if in the course of time it  has not been destroyed,&mdash;for look here.&rdquo; And turning over what remained of the  mutilated photograph he displayed the following:</p>
  <p>Cor.  9th Street w York) </p>
  <p>&ldquo;New  York! The portrait was made here and&mdash;at Fredericks&rsquo;. His studio was on the  corner of Ninth Street up to a few years ago. It&rsquo;s a trail after my own mind.  If that negative is in existence, I&rsquo;ll find it, if I have to ransack half the  photograph-studios in town. About how old do you think this picture is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old  enough to give you trouble. But that you&rsquo;re used to. What we want to know&mdash;what  we must know&mdash;is this: The name of the man who has incurred Madame&rsquo;s enmity to  such a degree that she spends the small hours of the night in knocking out his  features from a fifteen-year-old photograph. If it should prove to be that of a  public man, rich or otherwise, we might consistently lay it to social hatred;  but if, on the contrary, it turns out to be that of a private individual&mdash;well,  in that case, I shall have a task for you which may call for a little of that  assurance of which we have just acknowledged you possess a limited share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  evening, just at dusk, a taxicab which had been wandering up and down a  well-kept block in Eighty-seventh Street stopped suddenly in front of a certain  drug-store to let an old man out. He seemed very feeble and leaned heavily on  his cane while crossing the sidewalk toward the store. But his face was kindly,  and his whole aspect that of one who takes the ills of life without bitterness  or complaint. When halfway to his goal,&mdash;for twenty steps are a journey to one  who has to balance himself carefully with every one,&mdash;he slipped or stumbled,  and his cane flew out of his hand. Happily&mdash;because he seemed unable to reach it  himself&mdash;a young girl just emerging from the drug-store saw his plight and  stooping for the stick, handed it to him. He received it with a smile, and  while it was yet in both of their hands, said in the most matter-of-fact way in  the world:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, little Miss Duclos.&rdquo; Then suddenly: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not stop to think. She did not stop to ask herself what this question meant  or whether this old gentleman who seemed to know so much about her and the  family&rsquo;s secrets had a right to ask it, but blurted out in nervous haste as if  she knew of nothing else to do, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; and then started to run away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  back, little one.&rdquo; His tone was very imperative, but for all that of a nature  to win upon a frightened child. &ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he added soothingly as she  looked back, hesitating. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry, for I have something for her. I  recognized you the moment you stepped out of the store; but I see that you don&rsquo;t  remember me. But why should you? Little girls don&rsquo;t remember old men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  that benevolent smile as he poked about in one of his pockets and finally drew  out a little parcel which he held out toward her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  belongs to your aunt. See, it has her name on it, Madame Antoinette Duclos. It  came to the lodging-house in Fifty-third Street just after she left, and I was  asked to bring it to her. I was going to your house as soon as I had done my  little errand at this store, but now that I have met you, I will ask you to see  that she gets it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl looked down at the parcel, then up at him, and reaching out her hand, took  it.</p>
  <p>His  old heart, which had almost stopped, beat again naturally and with renewed  strength. He was on the correct trail. When Mrs. Duclos and the rest of them  had said that they knew of no one of their name in this country but themselves,  it was because the Madame of the Hotel Universal was of their family&mdash;the widow  of their brother, as this child&rsquo;s acknowledgment showed.</p>
  <p>He  was turning back to his taxi when the child, still trembling very much, took a  step toward him and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know where to find my aunt. She didn&rsquo;t tell us where she was going;  and&mdash;and I had rather not take this parcel back with me. Mother don&rsquo;t like us to  speak of Aunt Nettie; and&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t believe Aunt Nettie would care to have  this now. Won&rsquo;t&mdash;won&rsquo;t you forget about it, sir, if I promise to tell her some  day that it was brought back and I wouldn&rsquo;t take it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce felt a qualm of conscience. The child really was too simple to be made  game of. Besides, he felt sure that she had spoken the truth, so far as she  herself was concerned. She didn&rsquo;t know where her erratic aunt had gone; and any  further questioning would only frighten her without winning him the knowledge  he sought. He therefore took the parcel back, said some soothing words and made  his way across the walk to his taxi. But the number he gave the chauffeur was  that of the house where this little girl lived.</p>
  <p>He  arrived there first. To him, waiting in the parlor and very near the window,  her shrinking little figure looked pathetic enough, as glancing in at the taxi,  and finding it empty, she realized who might be awaiting her under her mother&rsquo;s  eye. He remembered his grandchild, and made up his mind, as she slid nervously  in, that no matter what happened he would keep this innocent child out of  trouble.</p>
  <p>The  lady who presently came in to receive him was one who called him instinctively  to his feet in respect and admiration. She was an American and of the best  type, a woman who, if she told a lie, would not tell it for her own comfort or  gain, but to help some one else to whom she owed fealty or love. But would she  lie for anyone? As he studied her longer, taking in, in his own way, the candid  expression of her eye and the sweet but firm set of her lips, he began to think  she would not, and the interest with which he proceeded to address her was as  much due to herself as to the knowledge he hoped to gain from her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Duclos?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. And you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a member of the New York police. My errand is one which you can probably  guess. You have a sister-in-law, the widow of your husband&rsquo;s brother. As her  testimony is of the utmost importance in the inquiry which is to be made into  the cause and manner of her daughter&rsquo;s death, I should be very glad to have a  few minutes&rsquo; talk with her if, as we have every reason to believe, she is in  this house at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Edward Duclos was a strong and upright woman, but this direct address, this  open attack, was too much for her. However, before replying, she had a question  of her own to put, and she proceeded to ask it firmly, quietly and apparently  with every expectation of its being answered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you learn that Mr. Duclos had a brother and that this brother had left a  widow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  from you, madam,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Nor from your husband. I very much wish we had.  We have been waiting for some such word ever since our advertisement appeared.  It has not come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave him a quick interrogating glance, folded her hands and answered without  further hesitation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  had our reasons for silence, reasons which we thought quite justifiable. But  they don&rsquo;t hold good if we are to be brought into conflict with the police. Mr.  Duclos told me this morning that if we were driven to speak we must do so with complete  honesty and without quibble. What do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything.  First, your sister-in-law&rsquo;s story, then her reasons for sending her child alone  to the museum, as well as the cause of her flight before she could have heard  of that poor child&rsquo;s fate. More hangs upon an understanding of these facts than  I am at liberty to tell you. She herself would agree with me in this if I could  have a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is not in the house. She left us late last night without giving us the least  hint as to where she was going. She is, as you can very well see, as little  anxious to talk of her great trouble as you are to have her, and recognizing  that attempts were being made to find her and make her speak, she fled before  it was too late. I am sorry she did so, sorry for her and sorry for ourselves.  We do not approve her course, whatever reasons she may have for it. At the same  time, I feel bound to assure you that to her they are all-sufficient. She is a  conscientious woman, with many fine qualities, and when she says as she did to  us, &lsquo;It is my duty to flee,&rsquo; and again as she bade us a final adieu, &lsquo;I will  die rather than speak a word of what is on my mind,&rsquo; I know that it is no small  matter which sends her wandering about like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think not. A mother to leave her daughter to be exposed at the morgue,  and never intervene to protect her from this ignominy or to see that she has  proper burial after that dread display is over!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know&mdash;it was dreadful&mdash;and we! Do you not think we felt the horror of this also?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  own flesh and blood&mdash;that is, your husband&rsquo;s. I wonder you could stand it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  had promised. She made us promise the first day she came that we would keep  still and make no move, whatever happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was here she came then, directly from the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am obliged to admit it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  her torn dress and her little bag?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you procured her different clothes and the suit-case in which she now lugs  about her effects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to know it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Duclos, I hope you will answer my next question as honestly as you have the  previous ones. Had Madame Duclos heard of her daughter&rsquo;s death when she first  presented herself to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  you ask me this, I must answer. She was in great distress, but did not tell me why,  till I asked her where Angeline was. Then she broke down utterly and flinging  herself face down on the sofa, sobbed and wailed and finally confided to us  that a terrible accident had happened to the child and that she was lying dead  in one of the city&rsquo;s great museums.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she say what accident?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  she was almost delirious with grief, and we couldn&rsquo;t question her. After the  papers came and we had read the dreadful news, we tried to get from her some  explanation of what it all meant, but now she wouldn&rsquo;t answer; before, she  couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you ask her how she came to know that Angeline was dead, before the news was  circulated outside the museum?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but she did not answer, only looked at us. It was the most despairing look I  ever saw in my life. It made it easier for us to promise her all she wanted,  though we regretted having done this when we came to think the matter over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you positively do not know any more than this of what she has so religiously  held secret?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  and I have got to the point where I do not wish to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know she was coming to this country?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but  not her reasons for doing so. She has been a little mysterious of late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she say she was going to bring her daughter with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she mentioned Angeline. Also the name of the ship on which they expected to  sail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  this letter mailed from Paris or London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  came from Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you understand that she was leaving France for good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got that idea, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not her reasons for it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  The letter was very short and not very explicit. I really have given you all  the information I have on this subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Duclos, it is my duty to inform you that your sister-in-law had a deep and  intense hatred for a man to us at present unknown. Can you name him? Is there  anything in her early history or in what you know of her later life, here and  abroad, to enlighten you as to his identity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a steady look and a slow shake of her head, Mrs. Duclos denied any such  knowledge, even showing a marked surprise at what was evidently a new  development to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Antoinette  has had little to do with the men since our brother&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can  hardly conceive of her being greatly interested either in favor of or against  any of the opposite sex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she is&mdash;even to the point of wishing him dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Duclos rose quickly to her feet, but instantly sat again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>Should  he tell her? At first he thought not; then he reconsidered his decision and  spoke out plainly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;some day you will hear what I had rather you heard now and from me.  Madame Duclos left the lodging-house where she was so safe because she was  detected, or was suspicious of having been detected, shooting the face from a  photograph she had set up before her as a target in the small hours of the  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;  The woman thus exclaiming was quite sincere. &ldquo;I cannot imagine Antoinette doing  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she did. We have the remains of the photograph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who was the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  we know that, we shall know all, or be in the way of knowing all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  alarm me!&rdquo; She certainly looked alarmed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  madam? Do you not think it better for the truth to be known in such a case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget what I told you. Antoinette will not survive the betrayal of her secret.  She said she would not, and she is a woman who weighs her words. There is a  firm edge to her resolves. It has always worked for good till now. I cannot  bear to think of its working in any way for evil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  she socialistic ideas? Can her hatred be for some of our plutocrats or supposed  oppressors of the people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no; she is of aristocratic descent and proud of her order. The Duclos are  bourgeois, but Antoinette is a De Montfort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce suppressed all token of his instinctive amazement. This fine American  woman was not without a sense of reflected glory given by this fact. Her  sister-in-law was a De Montfort! Expressing his thanks for her candor, he rose  to depart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  all that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she may be at heart a <i>r&eacute;volutionnaire</i>.&rdquo; Then, as he  noticed the negation in her look, he added softly: &ldquo;The least clue as to her  present refuge would make me greatly your debtor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot give it; I do not know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  somehow he believed her as absolutely as even she could desire. If he should  yet be fortunate enough to find this elusive Madame, it would have to be  through some other agency than these relatives of hers by marriage.</p>
  <p>As  he passed out, he heard a frightened gasp from somewhere back in the hall.  Turning, he asked in the most natural manner whether there were children in the  house.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Duclos answered with some dignity that she had three daughters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are fortunate, madame,&rdquo; he remarked with his old-fashioned bow. &ldquo;I live alone.  My last grandchild left me a year ago for a man many years my junior.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  brought the little one into his view. She was smiling, and he went away in a  state of relief marred by but one regret:</p>
  <p>He  was as ignorant as ever where to look for the mother of Angeline.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XX"></a><b>XX<br>
    Mr. Gryce And The Unwary Woman</b></h2>
  <p>Nevertheless  Mr. Gryce was proud of the gain he had made in his talk with Mrs. Duclos, and  he smiled as he thought of his next interview with Sweetwater. Assurance will  often accomplish much, it is true, but it sometimes needs age to make it  effective. He could not imagine either Mrs. Duclos or her daughter yielding to  the blandishments of one even as gifted in this special direction as  Sweetwater. Authority was needed as well&mdash;the authority of long experience and  an ineradicable sympathy with human nature.</p>
  <p>Thus  he gratified himself with a few complacent thoughts. But when he stopped to  think what a great haystack New York was, and how elusive was the needle which  had escaped them now these three times, his spirits sank a trifle, and by the  time he had ridden a half-block on his way back to Headquarters, he was at that  low ebb of disheartenment from which only some happy inspiration can  effectually lift one. He was glad to be able to report that he had learned a  few important facts in regard to Madame Duclos, but he equally hated to admit  that for all his haste in following up the clue given him, he knew as little as  ever of her present whereabouts; and hated even worse to have to give the cue  which would lead to a surveillance, however secret, over a house which held a  child of so sensitive and tremulous a nature as that of the little friend who  had picked up his stick in front of the drug-store.</p>
  <p>He  was recalling to mind the pathetic spectacle presented by her agitated little  figure, when his eyes chanced to fall upon a small shop he was then passing. It  was devoted to ladies&rsquo; furnishings, and as he took in the contents of the  window and such articles as could be seen on the shelves beyond, a happy  thought came to him.</p>
  <p>Madame  Duclos had left her hotel in a hurry, carrying but few of her belongings with  her. A lady of cultivated taste, she must have missed many articles necessary  to her comfort; and having money would naturally buy them. Prevented by her  fears from going downtown, or even from going anywhere in the daytime, what was  left for her to do but to patronize some such small shop as this. Its nearness  to her late refuge, as well as its neat and attractive appearance, made this  seem all the more likely. A question or two would suffice to settle his mind on  this point and perhaps lead to results which might prove invaluable in his  present emergency.</p>
  <p>Signaling  to the chauffeur to stop, he got out in front of this little shop, toward which  he immediately proceeded, with an uncertainty of step not altogether assumed.  He did have some rheumatic twinges that day.</p>
  <p>Entering,  Mr. Gryce first cast a comprehensive glance at the shelves and counters, to  make sure that he would find here the line of dress-goods in which he had  decided to invest; then, approaching the middle-aged woman who seemed to be in charge,  he engaged her in a tedious display of the goods, which led on to talk and  finally to a casual remark from him, quite in keeping with the anxiety he had  been careful to show.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am buying this for a woman to whom you have probably sold many odd little  things within the past few days. Perhaps you knew her taste, and can help me  choose what will please her. She lives down the street and buys always in the  evening&mdash;a dark, genteel appearing Frenchwoman, with a strange way of looking  down even when other people would be likely to look up. Do you remember her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yes,  she remembered her and recognized her perfectly from this description. He saw  this at once, but he kept right on talking as he handled first one piece of  goods and then another, seeming to hesitate between the gray and the brown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  went out of town yesterday, and wanted this material sent after her. Do you  think you could do that for me, or shall I have to see to expressing it myself?  I&rsquo;ll do it if I must&mdash;only I&rsquo;ve forgotten her exact address.&rdquo; This he muttered  self-reproachfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a shocking bad memory, and it&rsquo;s growing worse every  day. You don&rsquo;t happen to know where she&rsquo;s gone to, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  innocence of this appeal from one of his years and benevolent aspect did not  appear to raise the woman&rsquo;s suspicion; yet she limited her reply to this short  statement:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  send the goods, if you will make your choice.&rdquo; And it was not till long after  that he learned that Madame Duclos, being very anxious for her mail and such  newspapers as she wanted, had made arrangements with this woman to forward  them.</p>
  <p>Disappointed,  but still hoping for some acknowledgment that would give him what he wanted, he  continued to putter with the goods, when she broke in with harsh decision:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think she would prefer the gray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do you?&rdquo; said he, with just a hint of disapproval at the suggestion. &ldquo;I like  brown best, myself; but let it be the gray. Ten yards,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;She was  particular to say that she wanted ten yards, and that I was to be sure and  purchase the dress at the shop adjoining the drug-store. You see I have obeyed  her,&rdquo; he added with a touch of senility in his quiet chuckle which threw the  busy woman off her guard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that the dress I sold her before will not prove very  becoming. But gray is always good. That&rsquo;s why I advised it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, I see,&rdquo; chattered away the old man, not without some slight compunction. &ldquo;But  in my opinion she&rsquo;s too dark for such somber dresses. I&rsquo;ve told her so a score  of times.&rdquo; Then as he watched the woman before him rolling up the goods he  proceeded to ask with fussy importunity what she thought the express charges  were likely to be, for he wanted to pay the whole bill and be done with it.</p>
  <p>She  was caught&mdash;caught fairly this time, though I doubt if she ever knew it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t often send up the river,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But I should say that for a package  of this size and weight the charges would be about forty cents. But that you  can leave her to pay. She will be quite willing to do so, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, of course&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think of that. She&rsquo;ll pay for it, of course she&rsquo;ll  pay for it.&rdquo; And he continued to fuss and chat, with that curious mixture of  native shrewdness and senile interest in little things which he thought most  likely to impress the woman attending him, and trap her into giving him the  complete address.</p>
  <p>But  she was too wary, or too much preoccupied with her own affairs, to let the cat  any farther out of the bag, and he had to be content with her promise, that the  package should be given to the expressman as early as possible the next  morning.</p>
  <p>The  feebleness he showed while leaving the shop was in marked contrast, however, to  the vigor with which he took down the telephone-receiver in the booth of the  neighboring drug-store. But she was not there to see; nor anyone else who had  the least interest in his movements. He could, therefore, give all the emphasis  he desired to the demand he made upon Headquarters for a close watch to be set  on the adjoining dry-goods shop, for the purpose of intercepting and obtaining  the address of a certain package, on the point of being expressed from there to  some place up the river.</p>
  <p>Then  he went home; for by now he was fully as tired as his years demanded.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXI"></a><b>XXI<br>
    Perplexed</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Elvira  Brown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elvira  Brown? That the name on the package?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  name of a small town in the Catskills was given him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you. Very good work.&rdquo; And Mr. Gryce hung up the receiver. Then he stood  thinking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elvira  Brown! A very fair alias&mdash;that is, the <i>Brown</i> end. But what am I to think  of <i>Elvira</i>? And what am I to think of the <i>Brown</i>, now that I  remember that the woman who has chosen to hide her identity under another name  is a Frenchwoman. Something queer! Let me see if I can call up the  station-master at the place she&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  long-distance connection proving practicable, he found himself after a little  while in communication with the man he wanted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  Gryce, of the New York police. A woman in whom we&rsquo;re greatly interested has  just entered your town under the name of Elvira Brown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;Elvira  Brown!&rdquo;</i> </p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce was startled at the tone in which this was repeated, even making due  allowance for the medium through which it came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  What&rsquo;s there strange about that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  this: That&rsquo;s the name of a woman who has lived in these mountains for forty  years, and who died here three days ago. To-day we&rsquo;re going to bury her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This <i>was</i> a blow to the detective&rsquo;s expectations. What awful mistake had he  made? Or had it been made by the man detailed to steal the name from the  package&mdash;or by the woman in the shop, or by all these combined? He could not  stop to ask; but he caught at the first loose end which presented itself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it isn&rsquo;t she we&rsquo;re after, that&rsquo;s certain. The one we want is middle-aged, and  plain in looks and dress. If she came into your town, it was yesterday or  possibly the night before. You wouldn&rsquo;t be apt to notice her, unless your  attention was caught by her lameness. Do you remember any such person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  and I don&rsquo;t think anyone like that passed through my station. We&rsquo;re off the main  road, and our travelers are few. I would have noticed the arrival of a woman  like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce, with an exclamation of chagrin, hung up the receiver. He felt completely  balked.</p>
  <p>But  old as he was, he still had some of the tenacity of youth. He was not willing  to accept defeat without one more effort. Going downtown as usual, he wandered  again into the little dry-goods shop to see if the package had been sent.</p>
  <p>Yes,  it had gone, but the expressman had had some trouble with a drunken man who  actually took the package out of his hands and didn&rsquo;t give it back without a  squabble. Strange how men can drink till they can&rsquo;t see, and so early in the  morning, at that!</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce&rsquo;s vigorous hunch dismissed summarily this expression of opinion as  altogether feminine. But he had something to say about the package itself,  which kept the good woman waiting, though a customer or two demanded her  attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  think me a fussy old man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve worried about that package all  night. She needs a new dress so much, and I&rsquo;m afraid you didn&rsquo;t have the right  address. I remember it now&mdash;it was&mdash;was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barford  on the Hudson,&rdquo; she finished promptly. Evidently she begrudged the time she was  wasting on his imbecilities.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  it; that&rsquo;s it. &lsquo;Way up in the Catskills, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Those people are waiting, sir. I shall really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment! I want to buy something more for her. But I&rsquo;ll send it myself this  time; I won&rsquo;t bother you again. Another dress, something bright and prettier  than anything she has. She&rsquo;ll forgive me. She&rsquo;ll be glad to have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo; The woman was really very much embarrassed. She was honest to  the core, and though she enjoyed seeing her goods disappear from the shelves,  it wasn&rsquo;t in her heart to take advantage of a man so old as this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid  she wouldn&rsquo;t be pleased. You see, it isn&rsquo;t a fortnight since she bought and  made up the one I sold her first, and she thought that a great extravagance.  Now with the gray&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you speaking of the blue one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it wasn&rsquo;t blue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  color was it? Haven&rsquo;t you a bit left to show me? I should know better what to  do, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  pointed to a bolt of striped wool&mdash;a little gaudy for a woman whose taste they  had both been speaking of as inclined to the plain and somber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That?  But that&rsquo;s bright enough. I&rsquo;ve never seen her in that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t like it. But something made her take it. She wore it when she came in  last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did! Then I&rsquo;m satisfied. Thankee all the same. Just give me a pair of gloves  for her, and I&rsquo;ll be getting on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  picked out a pair for him, and he trotted away, mumbling cheerily to himself as  he passed between the counters. But once in his taxi again, he concentrated all  his thought on that bolt of striped dress-goods. The colors were crimson and  black, with a dot here and there of some lighter shade! He took pains to fix it  in his mind, for this was undoubtedly the dress she fled in&mdash;an important clue  to him, if this hunt should resolve itself into a chase with doubling and  redoubling of the escaping quarry.</p>
  <p>He  spent the next two hours in acquainting himself with the location and some of  the conditions of the town he now meant to visit. Though he could not  understand Madame Duclos&rsquo; reason for taking the name of a woman so well known  as this Elvira Brown, there was something in this circumstance and the fact  that the person so styled had been at that moment at the point of death, which  called, as he felt, for personal investigation. He hardly felt fit for any such  purely speculative expedition as this; especially as he must do without the  companionship, to say nothing of the assistance, of Sweetwater, whom he hardly  felt justified in withdrawing from the task he had given him. So he picked out  a fellow named Perry; and together they took the West Shore into Greene County,  where they stopped at a station from which a branch road ran to the small town  whither the package addressed to Elvira Brown had preceded them.</p>
  <p>Accidents  frequently determine our course, as well as turn us from the one we had mapped  out for ourselves. By accident I mean, in this case, an actual one which had  occurred on the branch road I have mentioned, by which the trains were held up  and further progress in that direction made impossible. When this came to the  knowledge of Mr. Gryce, he found it necessary to choose between trusting  himself to an automobile for the rest of the journey, or of remaining all night  in the town where the train had stopped. A glance at the hills towering up  between him and his goal decided him to wait for the running of the trains next  day; and after an inquiry or two, he left the station on foot for the hotel to  which he had been recommended.</p>
  <p>A  philosopher, in many regards, Mr. Gryce quieted himself, under the irritation  of this annoyance, with the thought that in this world we do not always know  just what is best for us; and that the few hours of rest thus forced upon him  by the seemingly unfortunate break in his plans might prove in the end to be  the best thing that could happen to him. He accordingly took a good room, enjoyed  a good dinner and then sat down in the lobby to have an equally good smoke. He  chose a chair which gave him a prospect of the river, and for a long time,  while vaguely listening to the talk about him, he feasted his eyes on the view  and allowed some of its calm to enter his perturbed spirit. But gradually, as  he looked and smoked, he found his attention caught, first by what a man was  saying in his rear, and secondly by something he saw intervening between  himself and the flow of shining river which had hitherto filled his eye.</p>
  <p>The  sentence which had roused him was one quite foreign to his thoughts and  seemingly of little importance to him or to anyone about. It was in connection  with a factory on the other side of the river, which was running overtime, and  had not help enough to fill its orders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  women we want,&rdquo; he heard shouted out. &ldquo;Young women, middle-aged women, any sort  of women who are anxious for steady work and good wages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  emphasis with which this announcement was made perhaps gave it point; at all  events this one brief sentence sank into Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s ear just as he began to  notice a woman who sat with her back to him on the hotel piazza.</p>
  <p>He  was not thinking of Madame Duclos at that moment; nor was there the least thing  about this woman to recall his secret quarry to mind. Yet once his eyes had  fallen on her, they remained there for several minutes.</p>
  <p>Why?</p>
  <p>Perhaps  because she sat so unnaturally still. In all the time he stared at her simple  bonnet and decently clothed shoulders, the silhouette she made against the  silver band of the river did not change by an iota. He had been agaze upon the  landscape too, but he was sure that he had not sat as still as this, and when,  after an interval during which he had turned to see what kind of man it was who  had spoken so vigorously, he wheeled back into place and glanced out again  through his window, she was there yet, hat, shoulders and all, immovable as an  image and almost as rigid.</p>
  <p>Well,  and what of it? There was surely nothing very remarkable in so commonplace a  fact; yet during the ensuing half-hour, during which he gave, or tried to give,  the greater part of his attention to the political talk which followed the  statements he had heard made in regard to the needs of a certain factory, his  eye would turn riverward from time to time and always with a view to see if  this woman had moved. And not once did he detect the least change in her  attitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will sit there all night,&rdquo; he muttered to himself; and after a while his  curiosity mounted to such a pitch that he got up and went out on the piazza for  one of his short strolls.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXII"></a><b>XXII<br>
    He Remembers</b></h2>
  <p>Just  an ordinary woman, lost in a dream of some kind while awaiting her departure on  an out-going train!&mdash;or such was Detective Gryce&rsquo;s conclusion as he hobbled slowly  past her.</p>
  <p>Why  should he give her a moment&rsquo;s thought? Yet he did. He noticed her dress and the  way she held her hands, and the fact, not suspected before, that she was not  looking out at the landscape outspread before her eyes, but down into her lap at  her own hands clasped together in an unnaturally tight grip. Then he  straightway forgot her in the thought of that other woman whose track he was  following with such poor promise of success. Madame Duclos&rsquo; image was in his  mind as plainly as if she sat before him in place of this chance passenger. He  knew the sort of hat she would wear (or thought he did). He also knew the color  of her dress. Had he not been shown the piece of goods from which it had been  taken? And had he not understood her choice, bizarre as it was, and for this  very reason, that it was bizarre? Being a woman of subtle mind, she would  reason that since the police were seeking one of plain exterior and simple  dress, a gaudy frock would throw them off their guard and insure her immunity from  any close inspection. Therefore this striped material rather than the plain  black she so much preferred. Then her eyes! She would try to hide the defect  which particularized them, by the use of glasses or, at least, by a very heavy  veil. While her walk&mdash;well! she might successfully conceal her halting step if  she were not hurried. But he promised himself that he would be very careful to  see that any woman rousing his suspicion should be given some reason for  hurrying.</p>
  <p>While  thus musing, he had reached the farther end of the piazza. In wheeling about to  come back, the woman whose profile he now faced attracted his eye again, in  spite of himself, and he gave her another idle thought. How absorbing was the  subject upon which she was brooding, and how deeply it affected her!</p>
  <p>It  struck him as he quietly repassed her that he had never seen a sadder face.  Then that impression passed from his mind, for he saw Perry coming toward him  with a pencil and telegram-blank in hand. He had decided to let Sweetwater know  where he could be reached that night, and Perry had come for the message.</p>
  <p>It  must have been fully two hours later that Mr. Gryce, sitting down in his former  chair, looked up and found his view unobstructed to the river. The woman had  gone.</p>
  <p>Just  for the sake of saying something to Perry, who had drawn up beside him, he  remarked upon the fact, adding in explanation of his interest in so small a  matter:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the thoughts and feelings of people which take hold of my curiosity now. Human  nature is a big book, a great book. I have only begun to thumb it, and I&rsquo;m an  old man. Some people betray their emotions in one way, some in another. Some  are loudest when most troubled, and some are so quiet one would think them  dead. The woman I was watching there was one of the quiet ones; her trouble was  deep; that was apparent from her outline&mdash;an outline which never varied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she&rsquo;s a queer duck. I saw her: I even did an errand for her&mdash;that was before you  sat down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did an errand for her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  she wanted a newspaper. Of course I was glad to get it for her, as she said she  was lame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I suppose she spoke the truth. I didn&rsquo;t think of her being in any special  trouble, but I did think her an odd one. She seemed to be wearing two dresses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce started and turned sharply toward him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that you say? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  this: when she stopped to get her money out of some hidden pocket, she pulled  up the skirt of her dress, and I saw another one under it. Perhaps she thought  that was the easiest way of carrying it. I noticed that her suit-case was a  small one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Describe  that under-frock to me.&rdquo; Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s air and tone were unaccountably earnest. &ldquo;What  was its color?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  reddish, I think. No, it had stripes in it and something like spots. Do you  suppose it was her petticoat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce brought his hand down on his lame knee and did not seem to feel it. &ldquo;Find  out where she&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No, I will do it myself.&rdquo; And before the  other could recover from his astonishment, he had started for the piazza where  he had just seen the proprietor of the hotel take his seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  comes from an old man&rsquo;s folly in thinking he could manage an affair of this  kind without help,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself as he went stumping along. &ldquo;Had I  told Perry whom we were after and how he was to recognize her, I should have  spent my time talking with this woman instead of staring at her. Two dresses!  with the bright one under! Well, she&rsquo;s even more subtle than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  by this time, having reached the man he sought, he put his question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you tell me anything about the woman who was sitting here? Who she is and where  she has gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  woman who was sitting here? Why, I should say she was a factory hand and has  gone to her work on the other side of the river.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  name? Do you know her name? I&rsquo;m a detective from New York&mdash;one of the regular  police force. I&rsquo;m in search of a woman not unlike the one I saw here, though  not, I am bound to state, a factory worker except on compulsion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are! A police detective, eh, and at your age! It must be a healthy employment.  But about this woman! I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t tell you anything except that she  came on the same train you did and wanted a boat right away to take her across  the river. You see, we&rsquo;ve no ferry here, and I told her so, and the only way  she could get across was to wait for Phil Jenkins, who was going over at five.  She said she would wait, and sat down here, refusing dinner, or even to enter  the house. Perhaps she wasn&rsquo;t hungry, and perhaps she didn&rsquo;t wish to register,  eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  her speech an accent? Did you take her for a foreign woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I did and I didn&rsquo;t. She spoke very well. She&rsquo;s not young, you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not looking for a young woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she&rsquo;s gone and you can&rsquo;t reach her to-night. There they are now, see! about a  quarter of the way across. That small boat just slipping across the wake of the  big one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce looked and saw that she was in the way of escape for to-night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  can I get over?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  till Phil crosses again to-morrow noon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,  she may go anywhere. I shall certainly lose her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly.  She&rsquo;s bound for the factory; you can just see the roof of it above the trees a  little to the right. She asked me all sorts of questions about the work over  there, and whether there were decent places to live in within walking distance  of the factory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she isn&rsquo;t lame? My woman is a trifle lame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  may this woman be, for all I know. I didn&rsquo;t see her on her feet, but she  carried no crutch&mdash;only a bag and an umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  brown bag, neat like herself in appearance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  It was light in color and old. She herself was neat enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce&rsquo;s brows came together. He was in a quandary. He felt convinced, with a  positiveness which surprised him, that in watching the withdrawal of this small  boat farther and farther toward the opposite shore, he was watching the escape  of Antoinette Duclos from his immediate interference.</p>
  <p>Yet,  circumstantial as were the proofs which had led him to this conclusion, he felt  that he would gladly welcome some further corroboration of those proofs before  risking the time and opportunity he might lose in following the person of two  skirts to her destination on the other side of the Hudson. There were more  reasons than one why he could not afford to lose one unnecessary minute. An  extra twinge or two of rheumatism warned him that he was approaching the point  of disablement.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  of Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s secret fears there was one which loomed larger than the others  and held an impulsive, unconsidered movement in check. He must have proof of  her identity&mdash;which nevertheless he did not question&mdash;before hazarding himself  and the success of his undertaking by a delay of so many additional hours. But  what proof could he hope to obtain under the circumstances in which he found  himself placed? Any appeal to Mrs. Edouard Duclos, by telephone or telegram,  would certainly fail of its purpose. Even if the neat black dress in which her  sister-in-law now traveled was one from her own wardrobe, he would find it impossible  to establish the fact in time to make his own decision. The child&mdash;yes, he might  worm that fact out of the child if he were where he could reach her; but he was  miles away; and besides, something within him revolted from involving this  child further in schemes honest enough from his standpoint, but certainly not  helpful to her. No, he would have to trust his intuition, or&mdash;</p>
  <p>He  had thrown himself into a chair at the side of his host, but he rose quickly as  his musings reached this point. The proof he had been looking for was his. In  recalling the child to mind there had flashed upon his inner vision an  instantaneous picture of her appearance as she stooped to pick up his stick in  front of the drug-store. He saw again the bending figure, the flushed cheeks  and the flaxen locks surmounted by a little hat. Ah! it was that little hat!  The impression it had made upon him was greater than he thought. He found that  he remembered not only its ribbons, but the bunches of curiously tinted flowers  hanging down in front. And these bunches, or some precisely like them, had been  the sole trimming of the hat he had been contemplating so long from the other  side of the window. The woman was Madame Duclos. These flowers had been taken  from the child&rsquo;s hat and pinned upon the aunt&rsquo;s; and it was their familiar look  which had given him, without any recognition of the reason, his surety as to  the latter&rsquo;s identity.</p>
  <p>Calmed  immensely by this assurance, he turned back to have another word with the  proprietor, now busily engaged with his newspaper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you be obliging enough to see that I&rsquo;m given an opportunity for a few words  with this Phil Jenkins on his return?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;And if you will be so good,  respect my confidence till I am sure I have made no mistake in thinking what I have  of his passenger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  proprietor nodded, and Mr. Gryce settled himself again inside to watch for the  rowboat&rsquo;s return.</p>
  <p>What  he learned that night from this man Jenkins calmed him still further. The woman  had acknowledged, on leaving him, that she was going to seek work at the  factory. &ldquo;A little old for the job,&rdquo; the man volunteered, &ldquo;but spry. How she  did clamber up that bank!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was enough; Mr. Gryce was satisfied, and engaged a seat in his small boat for  the following day.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXIII"></a><b>XXIII<br>
    Girls, Girls! Nothing But Girls!</b></h2>
  <p>The  superintendent was puzzled and showed it. He listened to Mr. Gryce with a  shrug, saying that so many women had been taken on that day, that he really  couldn&rsquo;t remember whether any one of them answered to the given description.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the time-keeper&rsquo;s book. Look it over. All the names are there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce did as he advised, but of course without finding there the name of  Antoinette Duclos or of anyone else of whom he had ever heard.</p>
  <p>The  next thing was for him to go through the factory itself and see if he could  pick her out from those already at work. This he was greatly averse to doing;  it would be too long and painful an effort for him, and he could not trust  Perry with any such piece of nice discrimination. How he missed Sweetwater! How  tempted he was to send for him! It was finally decided that when the hour came  for the departure of the whole dayshift, he should take his stand where he  could mark each employee as she filed out.</p>
  <p>A  sorry attempt followed by as sorry a failure! He did not see one among them who  was over twenty-five years of age. But this did not mean the end of all hope.  There was the nightshift. Might she not be put on that? A different man had  charge at night. He would wait for this man&rsquo;s appearance, present his cause to  him and see what could be done.</p>
  <p>Not  much, he found, when the night superintendent finally entered the office and he  had the chance of introducing himself. Newer to authority than the  superintendent of the dayshift, he was also of a more active temperament and  much more self-assertive. He was not impressed by the detective&rsquo;s years or even  by his errand. It was a busy night, a very busy night&mdash;new hands in every  department. To take him through the building at present was quite out of the  question. Perhaps later it might be done; but not now, not now.</p>
  <p>With  that the night superintendent bustled out. This was not very encouraging, but  Mr. Gryce did not despair. He had seen with what ease he could look from the  broad, rear window near which he stood, into the rooms where rows upon rows of  girls were already at work. Only a narrow court divided him from these girls,  and as the three stories of which the factory was composed were all brilliantly  lighted, he should have little difficulty in picking out from among them the  middle-aged woman who held in her closed and mysterious hand the key to that  formidable affair threatening the honor of one of New York&rsquo;s most prominent  men.</p>
  <p>Before  doing this, Mr. Gryce stopped to locate himself and recall if possible the entire  plan of the building. He was in what was called the outer office. The inner  one, used only by the president of the concern, opened on his left. There was  no one in the latter room at present, the president seldom showing up at night.  Another door led to the platform outside, and a third one, located in the  middle of the right-hand partition, to a large vestibule or locker-room  belonging exclusively to the girls, which in its turn communicated with the  work-rooms of the factory running in unbroken continuity around a narrow  central court.</p>
  <p>He  had been through this locker-room in the late afternoon. It was here he had  stood to watch the girls file out at the close of their day&rsquo;s work. The exit  for all employees was in one of the corners and out of this Antoinette Duclos  would have to pass when it came her turn to leave the building&mdash;that is, if she  were really in it, as he had every reason to believe.</p>
  <p>However,  certainty on this point would relieve him from much of his present impatience,  and with this end in view he prepared to enter the room again in the hope of  spying among the various hats with which the walls were hung the one with whose  shape and trimming he was so well acquainted.</p>
  <p>But  promising as this attempt looked, it was destined to immediate failure. The  room was not empty. He could hear girls whispering not a dozen steps away, and  anxious as he always was not to attract any unnecessary attention to himself,  he turned his back upon this door and returned to the window from the broad  view of which he anticipated so much.</p>
  <p>A  brilliant scene awaited him. This building, built originally for other  purposes, had been hastily reconstructed for its present use in a manner  possibly open to criticism but which certainly gave those who worked in it an  abundance of light and air. The narrow columns supporting its three stories  were so inconspicuous at night when a blaze of electricity dominated the whole,  that it presented the appearance of being made entirely of windows. One break  and one only he observed in the double row of lights encircling the courtyard.  This was in a spot diagonally opposite, where a space of several feet showed a  dimness he failed to understand. But as no workers appeared to be there, he  passed the matter over as one of no importance.</p>
  <p>The  task before him looked hopeless. In the first place there were the three  floors, with no faces visible above the first one. Then of the long rectangle  stretching out before him he could see but two sides, which fact was further  complicated by there being as many of the workers&rsquo; faces turned toward the  outside of the building as toward the court. Yet having determined upon his  course, he was bound to see it through.</p>
  <p>His  position near the corner of the huge rectangle precluded his seeing anyone  working at his own end. He was obliged to pass them over. But of those  opposite, especially those directly so, he could take easy count. They were all  girls of fifteen or so, and could be passed over also without more than a  cursory glance. Further on he saw a row of older women, and student as he was  of human nature, there were faces among them at which he was tempted to look  twice, though once answered his purpose. There was no Madame there.</p>
  <p>Continuing  his examination, he next encountered the space so unaccountably darkened, and  having skipped this, came upon a stretch of benches displaying great activity.  Only old hands seemed to be at work in this section. Their method and despatch  showed a training which made it useless to look among them for one who had  probably never worked before amid the hum of machinery.</p>
  <p>In  the corner beyond he saw nobody, but when he came to look along the end  connecting the opposite rooms with those on his side, a different scene awaited  him. There every bench seemed occupied both back and front, and mostly by  newcomers, as was apparent from the anxious way the superintendent moved about  among them, explaining the work and directing them with a zeal which not only  attested his interest in the task but showed how completely he had forgotten  the man he had left behind him in his office. Well, well, such is the way of  the world! The old man saw that he would have to depend upon himself, and  realizing this, bent all his energies to his present far-off inspection of  these women, hoping against hope that he would be able at least to tell the  young from the old.</p>
  <p>Yes,  he could do that, but the older women seemed to be in the majority; and this  perplexed him. It was all too distant for him to see clearly, but he took heart  of grace as he observed how the faces and figures he was studying so closely  were resolving themselves into mere silhouettes under his gaze. For as I have  already said, he had a quick eye for outline, and felt sure that he could  sufficiently recall that of the woman whose head and shoulders had been so long  under his eye that day, to recognize it even among fifty others. But not one of  them&mdash;not one of them all&mdash;had the precise narrowness and rigidity of Madame  Duclos&rsquo;; and after many painful minutes of renewed effort followed by renewed  disappointment he moved back from the window and sat down. There was one thing  you could always count on in Mr. Gryce, and that was his patience.</p>
  <p>But  it was a patience not without its breaks. Once he rose to look out front to  make sure he had not miscalculated the distance of this factory from the river.  Then after another period of waiting, he got thinking how much he might  discover if he could get one glimpse into that far corner contiguous to that  end of the rectangle where he had seen so many raw workers receiving the  assistance of the night superintendent. There was a way of doing this of which  he had not thought before. He had but to step outside, walk the length of the  platform where the loading of shipments was going on, and look in at one of the  great windows at the further end. But when he came to make the attempt, he  found himself plunged into such a turmoil and the way so blocked by the loading  of boxes and the backing up and driving off of horses that he retreated  precipitately. Rather than encounter all this, he would await events from the  inside. So he took his old seat again and for another half-hour listened to the  thump of machinery and the squeak of a rusty elevator-brake which almost robbed  him of thought. He was even inclined to doze, when he suddenly became aware of  some change either in himself or in what lay about him.</p>
  <p>Had  the machinery stopped? No, it was not that.</p>
  <p>The  place seemed darker, yet it was still very light.</p>
  <p>With  a restless move, he rose heavily and peered again into the court. Immediately  it was evident what had occurred. The whole string of lights in the third story  had been shut off, and now those of the middle story were following suit. Only  the ground floor remained active with all its lights at the maximum, and every  belt moving.</p>
  <p>At  this unexpected narrowing down of his field of operations he felt greatly  relieved. He had dreaded those long walks through innumerable rooms. He could  manage circling the building once, but three times would have been too much. In  a mood of increased contentment, he started to return to his seat, but found  himself stayed by something he saw in what had been but a dimly lighted space  when he looked there last. It was now as bright as the rest and showed him the  figure of the superintendent stooping over a woman, explaining to her some  intricate manipulation of the work in hand which was evidently quite new to  her. He could see him very plainly, but her figure was more or less hidden. Not  for long though. The superintendent passed on and she came into full view. It  was Antoinette Duclos. He was confident of this even before he noted her dress.  When his eyes fell on that, he was sure; there was no mistaking the stripes and  the dots. Antoinette Duclos! and she was where he could reach her in five minutes&mdash;in  fact as soon as the superintendent returned. As he stood and watched her  working quite assiduously but in something like isolation, he felt as though  ten years had slipped from his age, and trifled with his pleasure as the rest  of us do when we behold a despaired-of goal loom suddenly in sight. Was she the  woman he had pictured in his mind&rsquo;s eye? Hardly. Yet there was an admirable  directness in her movements. From the way she went about things, he could  plainly see that she would master her duties in no time if Fate did not  interpose to prevent. It certainly was hard to interrupt her in her work just  when she was on the way to safety and competence. But there could be no  question of his duty, or of the claims of Mr. Roberts to whatever help might  accrue from an understanding of the relation of this woman to events  threatening his reputation with such utter destruction. Her story might free  him from all suspicion or it might actually determine his guilt. Therefore her  story must be had, and at once&mdash;if possible, this very night.</p>
  <p>But  he must wait&mdash;wait for the coming of the superintendent. He felt safe to do  this. Meanwhile he was determined not to let this woman out of his sight; so,  drawing up a chair, he settled down within view of her active figure, from which  all rigidity had vanished in the interest she was rapidly developing in her  work. If he could have seen her countenance more clearly, he would have been  glad. There seemed to be a veil between him and it, a hazy indistinctness which  he found it difficult to understand; but remembering that he was looking  through two windows and on a long diagonal, he accepted this slight drawback  with equanimity and was about to indulge in the comfort of a cigar when he saw  the scene he still held in view change, and change vividly, to the excitation  of a fresh interest and a still more careful watch.</p>
  <p>A  girl had approached Madame Duclos from some place quite out of sight, and in  passing her by, had slipped a note into her hand. The Frenchwoman had taken it,  but in a way indicating shock. The ease which had given suppleness to her form  and surety to all her movements was gone in an instant, and from the furtive  way in which she sought to read the communication thus handed her Mr. Gryce saw  that his own powers would soon be taxed to keep him even with a situation  changing thus from moment to moment under his eye.</p>
  <p>What  did that note contain, and who could have taken advantage of the arrival of  some late-comer to slip it into her hand? Mr. Gryce found this a very  formidable question, and watched with ever-increasing anxiety to see what  effect these unknown words would have upon their recipient when her opportunity  came for reading them.</p>
  <p>A  startling one&mdash;of that he was presently a witness; for no sooner had she taken  in their import than she cast a hurried look about her and left her place  without fuss or flurry, but with an air of quiet determination which Mr. Gryce  felt confident covered a resolution which nothing could balk.</p>
  <p>She  had not only left her bench but seemingly was in the act of leaving the  building. This, of course, it was for him to prevent, and he rose to do so. It  might be interesting to wait and watch her hurrying figure threading its way to  the locker-room through the double row of girls on the opposite side of the  court; but there were reasons why he wished to reach that last mentioned room  before she did; reasons which seemed good enough to send him there without any  further delay. If he could but discover her hat among the many he had seen  hanging on pegs in one of the corners, how easy it would be for him to hold her  back till he could make her listen to the few words which must be said before  he could allow her to leave the building.</p>
  <p>Quick  of eye, if not of step, he had run in review the varying headgear depending  from those isolated pegs, before he had half-circled the lockers. But hers he  did not see. Could she have been given a locker on this her first night? He did  not think so; and approaching closer, he looked again. The hat was there, but  lying on the floor. Somebody had knocked it down; perhaps the late-comer who  had given her the letter.</p>
  <p>Greatly  gratified by the advantage he now indisputably held over her, he picked up the  hat and approached the door through which she must in another minute emerge.</p>
  <p>She  did not come.</p>
  <p>He  waited and waited, and still she did not come. At last, driven by impatience,  he ventured to open the door he had previously hesitated to touch and took a  quick look in. Girls, girls! nothing but girls! No Madame Duclos anywhere.</p>
  <p>Something  must have happened to interrupt her escape. Either she had been caught in the  attempt by the superintendent or by some one else of equal authority. This, if  bad for her, was also bad for him, as a quiet hold-up in the manner he had  planned was certainly better than the public one which must now follow.</p>
  <p>Sorry  for her and sorry for himself, Mr. Gryce returned to the office just as the  superintendent entered from the opposite door. He thought the latter looked a  little queer, and in an instant he learned why.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the woman you wanted a staid, elderly person, apparently a foreigner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;of  French birth, I am told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I guess you were all right in distrusting her. She&rsquo;s gone&mdash;took a notion that  night work didn&rsquo;t agree with her and left without so much as a &lsquo;By your leave!&rsquo;  She must have smelt you out in some uncanny way. Too bad! She bade fair to be  just the woman we wanted for a very nice part of the work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean she&rsquo;s really out of the building&mdash;that you didn&rsquo;t stop her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know what she was up to, till she was gone. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how did she get out? She didn&rsquo;t go by the employees&rsquo; door for I stood there on  the watch. I had seen her receive a note&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  note? How? Who gave it to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you saw this? How could you? Been through the work-rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I saw her from this window, as I was looking diagonally across the court. She  was in one of the opposite rooms over there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  superintendent broke into a hearty laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fooled!&rdquo;  he cried. &ldquo;You police detectives are a smart crowd, but our old factory with  its string of useless windows has led you astray for once. You weren&rsquo;t looking  into any one of the rooms over there. You were looking at a reflection in that  useless old window behind which the elevator runs. That happens when the elevator  running on that side is down. I&rsquo;ve seen it often and laughed in my sleeve at  the chance it gives me to observe on the sly how things are going on at certain  benches. Many a girl has got her discharge&mdash;But no matter about that. Come here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  room you think you see over there&mdash;you will notice that nobody is at work in it  now&mdash;is on this side of the building, and the woman you have in chase escaped by  the south delivery-door. We are loading cars to-night from this side of the  building, and she took a flying advantage of it. Men give way to a woman.  Though there&rsquo;s an order against any such use of that door, you can&rsquo;t get one of  them to hold onto a woman when she once gets it into her head to skip the  premises. But she can&rsquo;t have gone far. This is a place of few houses and no big  buildings besides the factory. If you take pains to head her off at the  station, you&rsquo;ll be safe for to-night, and in the morning you can easily find  her. Now I must go; but first, what was her offense? Theft, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  This woman whom we have let slip through our fingers is Madame Duclos, the  mother of the girl shot in a New York museum. There is a big reward out for her  recovery and detention, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  superintendent stood aghast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you say so? Why didn&rsquo;t you say so at once? I&rsquo;d have had the whole troop  file out before you. I&rsquo;d have had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective caught at his hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wasn&rsquo;t aware that I had reached an age when I couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference  between a reflection and a reality,&rdquo; he growled, and hurried out.</p>
  <p>The  town was a small one; and Perry would see that she didn&rsquo;t escape from the  station. Besides, she had fled without her hat. Surely, with all this in his  favor, he would soon be able to lay his hand upon her, if not to-night,  certainly before another day was at an end.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXIV"></a><b>XXIV<br>
    Flight</b></h2>
  <p>In  leaving the building Mr. Gryce almost ran into the arms of Perry. In his  anxiety to be within call, the young detective had seated himself on the steps  outside and now stood ready for any emergency.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce&rsquo;s spirits rose as he saw him there. The great door leading to the  elevator opened not twenty feet to the left of him. Perhaps Perry had seen the  woman and could tell which way she ran. Questions followed, rapid and to the  purpose. Perry had seen a woman flash by. But she seemed to be in company with  a man. He had not been able to see either clearly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  way were they heading?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gryce.</p>
  <p>Perry  told him.</p>
  <p>It  would look as though they were making for the station. Alarmed at the idea, Mr.  Gryce stepped down into the road and endeavored to pierce the darkness in that  direction. All he could see were the station lights. Everything else was in  shadow. The night hung over all, and had it not been for the grinding of  machinery in their rear, the silence would have been just as marked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perry,  is the way rough between here and the station&mdash;I mean, rough for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  very, if you keep in the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run  ahead, then, and learn how soon the next train is due&mdash;any train, going north or  going south&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care which. If it is soon, look for a middle-aged woman in  a striped dress, and if you can&rsquo;t prevent her getting on, without a fracas,  follow her yourself and never quit her&mdash;telegraphing me at the first  opportunity. Run.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perry  gave a leap and was soon swallowed up in the darkness which was intense as soon  as he had passed beyond the glare from the factory. Mr. Gryce followed after,  moving as quickly as he dared. It was not far to the station platform, but in  his anxiety it seemed a mile; nor did he breathe with ease till he saw a flying  shadow come between him and the station lights and knew that Perry had reached  the platform.</p>
  <p>It  was just at the hour when the fewest trains pass, and Mr. Gryce was himself  across the tracks and on the platform before a far-off whistle warned him that  one was approaching. Looking hastily around, he saw Perry hurrying up behind  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No such person around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  waited. The train came in, stopped, took on two unimportant passengers and  rushed away north.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I shall have to ask you to stay here, Perry. It would be so easy for her  to board one of these night trains and buy a ticket from the conductor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  as he spoke he paused, and gripping Perry&rsquo;s arm, turned his ear to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  boat,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A small boat leaving shore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was so. They could hear the dip of the oars distinctly in the quiet which had  followed the departure of the train. No other sound but that was in the air,  and it struck cold upon one old heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is she! I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; muttered Gryce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man across the river has warned her&mdash;sent a boat for her, perhaps. Run down to  the point and see if there is anyone there who saw her go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perry  slid into the night, and Mr. Gryce stood listening. The quiet dip of the oars  was growing fainter every instant. The boat was rapidly withdrawing, carrying  with it all hope of securing off-hand this desirable witness.</p>
  <p>To  be sure, there was nothing very serious in this. He had only to telephone  across the river to have the woman detained till he could reach her himself in  the early morning. Yet he felt unaccountably disturbed and anxious. For all his  many experiences and a record which should have made him immune from the  ordinary disappointments of life, he had never, or so it seemed to him, felt  more thoroughly depressed or weary of the work which had given him occupation  for more years than he liked to number, than in the few minutes of solitary  waiting, with his face toward the river and the sense of some impending doom  settling slowly over his aged heart.</p>
  <p>But  he was still too much the successful detective to allow his disheartenment to  be seen by his admiring subordinate. As the latter approached, the old man&rsquo;s  countenance brightened, and nothing could have been more deceptive than the  calmness he displayed when the fellow reported that he had just been talking to  a man who had recognized the boat and the oarsman. It was the same boat and the  same oarsman that had brought them over earlier in the day. He had made an  extra trip at this most unusual hour, for the express purpose of taking this  woman back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose there is no possibility of your drumming up anyone to row us over in  time to catch them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  in the least. I have inquired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  follow me into the station. I have a few messages to send.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Among  these messages was a peremptory one to Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>Morning!  and an early crossing to the other side. Here a surprise awaited them. They  found, on inquiry, that the man responsible for Madame&rsquo;s flitting was not, as  they had supposed, the hotel proprietor, but Phil himself, the good-natured,  easily-imposed-upon ferryman, on whose sympathies she had worked during their  first short passage from one shore to the other. Perhaps a little money had  helped to deepen this impression; one never knows.</p>
  <p>But  this was not all. The woman was gone. She had fled the town on foot before they  were able to locate Phil, who had not made shore at his usual place but at some  point up the river about which they knew nothing. When he finally showed up, it  was almost daybreak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is he now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  home, or ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show  me the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  ten minutes the two were face to face.</p>
  <p>The  result was not altogether satisfactory to the detective. Though he used all his  skill in his manipulation of this kind-hearted ferryman, he got very little  from him but the plain fact that the woman insisted upon taking to the road  when she heard that the train-service had stopped; that he could not persuade  her to wait till daylight or to listen for a moment to what he had to say of  the danger and terrors awaiting her in the darkness, and the awful loneliness  of the hills. She didn&rsquo;t fear nature even at its worst, and she knew these  hills better than many who had lived among them for years. She was bound to go,  and she went.</p>
  <p>This  was six hours ago. Asked to explain the interest he had shown in her, it soon  became evident that he was in complete ignorance of her identity. He had  simply, on their first trip over, seen that she was middle-aged, suffering and  much too good and kind to be followed up by enemies and wicked police officials.  True, he had rowed them over in her pursuit in the early part of the day, but  that was because he had not known their business. When on returning he had  learned it, he made up his mind to help her out with a warning even if it kept  him up all night. He had not expected to bring her back with him, but she had  insisted upon his doing so, saying that she had friends in the mountains who  would look after her. He saw that she was dreadfully in earnest, for she had  not stopped to get her hat and would not have had so much as an extra stitch  with her if she had not taken the precaution to hide a bag of things somewhere  in the bushes near the factory, in anticipation of some such emergency. And he  couldn&rsquo;t resist her. She made him think of a sister of his who had had a  dreadful time of it in the world and was now well out of it, thank God!</p>
  <p>When  the ferryman heard that a reward of hundreds of dollars was waiting for the man  who succeeded in bringing her before the police officials in New York, he  betrayed some chagrin, but even this did not last. He was soon declaring with  heartfelt earnestness that he didn&rsquo;t care anything about that. It was peace of  mind he wanted, and not money.</p>
  <p>When  Mr. Gryce left him, it was with an even slower step than usual. Peace of mind!  How about his own peace of mind? Was he trailing this poor unfortunate from  pillar to post, for the reward it would bring him? No. With his advancing years  money had lost much of its attraction. Nor, if he knew himself, was he  particularly affected by the glory which attends success. Duty, and duty only,  drove him on&mdash;to elucidate his problem and merit the confidence put in him by  his superiors. If suffering followed, that was not his fault; his business was  to go ahead.</p>
  <p>It  was in this frame of mind that he prepared himself for the automobile trip he  saw before him.</p>
  <p>There  was no question in Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s mind now, as to this woman&rsquo;s destination or  whither he should be obliged to go in order to find her. As he now saw into her  mind, she had left New York with the intention of hiding herself in the remote  village to which she had ordered her mail sent under the name of Elvira Brown,  whom she evidently knew; but hearing, either on the car or in the hotel, where  she was detained, the plea which was being made for workers in the factory on  the east side of the river, she had modified her plans to the extent already  known, only to return to her original intention as soon as the attempt to  provide for herself in this independent way had proved a failure.</p>
  <p>He  would proceed then in her wake, conscious of the fresh disappointment which  awaited her in the loss, through Miss Brown&rsquo;s sudden death, of the asylum she  counted upon. Could he have gone on foot like herself, he might have been  tempted to do so, for a trail is best followed slowly and with ear and eye very  close to the ground. But as this was beyond his strength, he must wait till an  automobile could be procured, and possibly till Sweetwater should arrive&mdash;for  Perry was no man for this job. There were no automobiles in this small town,  and it might be necessary to send up or down the river some distance before one  could be found capable of carrying them over the precipitous road they would be  obliged to take in order to avoid the washout which had driven them to this extremity.</p>
  <p>But  all would come right in time; and with Sweetwater at his elbow, the journey  would be made and the woman caught, soon enough for him no doubt, hard as he  felt it to wait. Why so hard, he might have found it difficult to say, since  hitherto he had found it easy enough when the goal seemed sure and it was only  with time he had to reckon!</p>

    Terror</b></h2>
  <p>A  woman fleeing from publicity as one flies from death&mdash;a refined woman, too,  whose life had hitherto been passed in the open!</p>
  <p>When  Antoinette Duclos, after a night and morning of unprecedented fatigue and  extraordinary fears, with little to upbear her in the way of food, stepped from  the train which brought a few local passengers into the quiet village of Rexam,  she hardly would have been recognized by her best friend, such marks may a few  hours leave upon one battling with untoward Fate in one supreme effort.</p>
  <p>She  seemed to realize this, for meeting more than one eye fixed inquiringly upon  her she drew down the veil wound about a sort of cap she wore till it concealed  not only her features but her throat which a restless pulse had tightened  almost to the exclusion of her breath. Ready to drop, she yet made use of the  little energy left her, to approach with faltering steps a lumbering old  vehicle waiting in the dust and smoke for such passengers as might wish to be  taken up Long Hill.</p>
  <p>There  was no driver in sight, but she did not hesitate to take her seat inside. There  was extra business at the station, for this was the first train to come in for  two days; and if anyone noticed her in the shadowy recesses of the cumbrous old  coach, nobody approached her; nor was she in any way disturbed. When the driver  did show himself, she was almost asleep, but she woke up quickly enough when  his good-natured face peered in at her and she heard him ask where she wanted  to go and whether she had any baggage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to go up Long Hill and be set down at the first cross-road,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My  baggage is here.&rdquo; And she pointed to the space at her feet. But that space was  empty; she had no baggage. She had dropped both bag and umbrella at the side of  the road after one of her long climbs under a fitful moon and had not so much  as thought of them since.</p>
  <p>Now  she remembered and flushed as she met the eyes of the man looking in at her  with his hand on his whiskers, smoothing them thoughtfully down but saying  nothing, though his countenance and expression showed him to be one of the  loquacious sort. If any smiles remained to her from the old days, now was the  time for one; but before she could twist her dry lips into any such attempt, he  had uttered a cheerful &ldquo;All right&rdquo; and turned away to clamber up into his seat.</p>
  <p>The  relief was great, and she settled back, rejoicing in the fact that they would  soon be moving and that she was likely to be the sole passenger. But she soon  came to rue this fact, for the driver wanted to talk and even made many  abortive attempts that way. But she could not fall in with his mood, and seeing  this, he soon withheld all remarks and bent his full energies to the task of  urging his horses up the interminable incline.</p>
  <p>Houses,  at which she scarcely looked, disappeared gradually from view, and groups of  spreading trees and patches of upland took their places, deepening into the  forest as they advanced. When halfway up, the farther mountains, which had  hitherto been hidden by nearer hills, burst into view. Behind them the sun was  setting, and the scene was glorious. If she saw it at all, she gave no sign of  pleasure or even of admiration. Her head, which she had held straight up for  the first quarter of a mile, sank lower and lower as they clambered on; yet she  gave no signs of drowsiness&mdash;only of a mortal weariness which seemed to attack  the very springs of life. The pomp and pageantry of the heavens, burning with all  the pigments of the rainbow, failed to appeal to a soul shut within dungeon  bars. Rocks and mighty gorges darkling to the eye and stirring to the  imagination held no story for her; she looked neither to the right nor to the  left while the beauty lasted, much less when the last gleam had faded from the  mountain tops and a troop of leaden clouds, coming up from the east, added  their shadows to those of premature night.</p>
  <p>The  driver, who had been eying these clouds for some little time, felt that he  ought to speak if she did not. Pulling up his horses as though to give them a  breathing spell, he remarked over his shoulder with a strain of anxiety in his  voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope your friends live near the top of the hill, missus. A storm is coming up,  and it&rsquo;s getting very dark. Will you have to walk far?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; she assured him with a quick glance up and around her. &ldquo;A little way, a  very little way!&rdquo; Then she became quiet and absorbed again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got to go on,&rdquo; he broke in again as the top of the hill came in sight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a  passenger for the eight-fifty train waiting for me more than a mile along the  road. I shall have to leave you after I set you down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right; I expect that. I can take care of myself&mdash;don&rsquo;t worry. Not but what you&rsquo;re  very kind,&rdquo; she added after a moment, in her cultured voice, with just enough  trace of accent to make it linger sweetly in the ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  here we are,&rdquo; he called back a moment later, jerking his horses to a standstill  and jumping down into the road. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; east or goin&rsquo; west?&rdquo; he asked as he took  another glance at her frail and poorly protected figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  way,&rdquo; she answered, pointing east.</p>
  <p>He  stopped and stared at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  lives that way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&mdash;that is, nobody near enough for you to reach  shelter before the storm bursts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are mistaken,&rdquo; she said, cringing involuntarily as the first big clap of  thunder rolled in endless echoes among the mountains. And turning about, she  started hurriedly into the shadows of the narrow cross-road.</p>
  <p>He  gave one glance back at his horses, the twitching of whose ears showed  nervousness, uttered some familiar word and launched out after the woman. &ldquo;Pardon  me, missus,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but is it Miss Brown&rsquo;s you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  widow stopped, glanced back at him over her shoulder, made a quick, protesting  gesture and dashed on.</p>
  <p>With  a shake of his head and a muttered, &ldquo;Well, women do beat the devil!&rdquo; he  retraced his steps; and she proceeded on alone.</p>
  <p>As  the last sound of his horses&rsquo; hoof-beats died out on the road, a second clap of  thunder seemed to bring heaven and earth together. She scarcely looked up. She  was approaching a little weather-beaten house nestled among trees on the edge  of a deep gorge. As her eyes fell on it, her footsteps quickened, and lifting a  hasty hand, she pulled off her veil. A change quite indescribable, but real for  all that, had taken place in her worn and waxen features. Not joy, but a soft  expectancy relieved them from their extreme tension. If a friend awaited her,  that friend would have no difficulty in recognizing her now. But alas!</p>
  <p>A  few steps more, and she stood before the door. It had a desolate look; the  whole house had a desolate look, possibly because every shade was drawn. But  she did not notice this; she was too sure of her welcome. Raising her hand to  the knocker, she gave two sharp raps. Then she waited. No answer from within&mdash;no  sound of hurrying steps&mdash;only another rumble in the sky and a quick rustling of  the trees on either side of her as if the wind which made the horizon black had  sent an <i>avant-courieur</i> over the hilltops.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elvira  is out&mdash;gone to some church meeting or social gathering down in the village. She  will be back. But I won&rsquo;t wait. I will try and get in in the old way. The storm  may delay her indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leaving  the door, which was raised only two steps above the road, she walked to the  corner of the house and stooping down, felt behind a projecting stone for what  she had certainly expected to find there&mdash;a key to the front door.</p>
  <p>But  her hand came away empty.</p>
  <p>Surprised,  for this was not her first visit to this house (she had once spent weeks there  and knew the habits of its mistress well), she felt again in the place where  the key should be, and where she had so often found it when her friend was out.  But all to no avail. It was not there, and presently she was in the road again  staring at the closed-up front.</p>
  <p>As  she did so, these words left her lips:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she knew I might come at any minute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tottering  from fatigue, she caught at the trunk of a great tree which held roof and wall  in its embrace.</p>
  <p>Why  did it quiver? Why did the ground beneath her feet seem to rock and all nature  darken as with the falling of a pall. The storm was upon her. It had rolled up  with incredible swiftness and was about to break over her head. With a shock  she realized her position. No shelter, and the storm of the season upon her!  What should she do? There was no way of getting into the house at the rear, for  the bushes were too thick. She must accept her fate, be drenched to the skin,  perhaps smitten by the next thunderbolt. But Antoinette Duclos was no coward,  so far as physical ills were concerned. She drew herself up straight against  the trunk of the tree, thinking that this, bad as it was, was better than  shelter with the enemy at the door. She would be calm, and she was fast growing  so when she suddenly became aware of a man standing very near and hunting her  out through the dusk.</p>
  <p>She  never knew why the scream which rose in her throat did not pass her lips. Her  terror was unspeakable, for she had heard no advance; indeed, there was too  much noise about her for that. But it was the silent terror of despair, for she  thought it was the man from whom she had made this great effort at escape. But  he soon proved to her he was not. It was just the driver of the stagecoach,  returned to see what had become of her. He had feared to find her stricken down  in the road, and when he saw her clinging alone and in a maddened way to this  tree, he made no bones of speaking to her with all necessary plainness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  asked you if it was Missus Brown you had come to see,&rdquo; he called to her through  the din. &ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo; she shouted back. &ldquo;Why do you speak like that? Has anything happened  to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no&mdash;she was well when I heard from her last, and expecting me, or so she wrote.  Is she&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead,  missus. We buried her last Tuesday. I&rsquo;m sorry, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Why  finish? She was lying out before him, straight and stark in the road. A bolt of  lightning which at that moment tore its way through the heavens brought into  startling view her face, white with distraction, framed in a mass of iron-gray  locks released by her fall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heaven!&rdquo; burst from the lips of the frightened man as he stooped to lift her. &ldquo;What  am I going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  thunder answered him, or rather it robbed him for the moment of all thought.  Peal after peal rattled over the neighboring peaks, rocking the air on the  uplands and filling his soul with dismay. But when quiet had come again, hope  returned with it. She was not only standing upright but was crying in his ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I get into the house? If I could stay there to-night, I could go back  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see that you get in, if I have to break in a window,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re  sure that you will not be afraid to stay out this terrible storm in a house  with no neighbors within half a mile?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know the house. I have been here before, and if Elvira Brown could face the  storms of forty years from her solitary home, I can surely face a single one,  without losing my courage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  said no more, but approaching the house, began to test such windows as he could  reach. He finally broke in a pane and released the latch; after that, entrance  was easy.</p>
  <p>Yet  after he had opened the way for her and she had stepped into the dim interior,  he felt loth to leave her. Duty called him away. The passenger awaiting him up  the road was a man he could not afford to disappoint; yet he stood there longer  than the occasion warranted, with the knob of the door in hand, watching her  struggle with the lamp, which she at last succeeded in lighting. As the walls  of the hall and her anxiously bending figure burst into view, he uttered a  quick &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned, smiled and tried to thank him, but the words failed to leave her lips.  A nearer and fiercer bolt had shot to earth at that instant, striking a tree so  near that the noise of its fall mingled with the crash of the heavens. When it  had ceased, he had gone. He could not face the look with which she met this new  catastrophe.</p>
  <p>That  look never again left her. When she saw herself in a glass, as she presently  did, on entering one of the rooms lamp in hand, she was startled and muttered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own mother would pass me by if she saw me now. I could go anywhere I wished  without fear or dread. Why did I leave New York?&rdquo; And setting the lamp down,  she covered her face and wept.</p>
  <p>The  storm abated; a few minutes of fiercely pouring rain, and all was over. She was  left in ghastly quiet&mdash;a quiet which was almost worse than the turmoil which had  preceded it&mdash;to face her memories and accustom herself to the thought that the  solitary woman with whose life everything she looked upon was so intimately  connected was gone, never to pass through these doors again or touch with deft  and careful fingers the infinite number of little belongings with which the  house was filled.</p>
  <p>For  as yet nothing had been changed, nothing had been moved. How fitting this was,  Antoinette knew better than anybody else, perhaps, for she was the only person  whom Elvira Brown had ever allowed to spend any length of time with her, and  she could remember&mdash;alas! how vividly, in spite of the one great fear forever  gnawing at her heart&mdash;that an article, no matter how small, when once given  place in this house, held that place always till broken or in some other way  robbed of its usefulness. She looked at her friend&rsquo;s pet chair standing just in  the one spot where she had seen it eight years before, and her heart swelled,  and a tear rose in her eye. But there was not time for another. A sense of the  straits in which she found herself placed by the death of this dependable  friend returned upon her in full force; the past retired into its old place,  and the present, with its maddening problems, seized upon her nerve and quelled  her once indomitable spirit.</p>
  <p>The  fate which had pursued her ever since she had left her happy home in France had  not spared her at this crisis. The storm, of so little consequence to her, had  roused the driver&rsquo;s sympathy. This had not only fixed her image in his mind but  given away her destination. All hope of hiding herself among the mountains was  therefore gone. She would have to move on; but where? If she were but able to  leave now, she might before morning find some covert from which help might be  given her for further escape. But the condition of the roads, as well as her  own weakness, forbade that. She needed food: she needed sleep. Of food she  would find plenty, she was sure; but sleep! How could she sleep, with the  promise of the morrow before her? Yet she must; everything depended upon her  strength. How could she win that rest which alone would secure it.</p>
  <p>Pausing  in the midst of the hall whither her restless thought had driven her, she  stared in a fruitless inquiry at the wall confronting her. Her mind, like her  feet, was at a standstill. She could neither think nor act. In fact, she was at  the point of a nervous collapse, when slowly from out the void there rose to  her view and pierced its way into her mind the outline of the door upon which  she had been steadily looking but without seeing it till now. Why did she start  as it thus took on shape before her? There was nothing strange or mysterious  about it. It led nowhere; it hid nothing, unless it was the yard upon which it  directly opened.</p>
  <p>But  that yard! She remembered it well. It was unlike any other she had ever seen in  this country or her own. It was small and semicircular; it was shut in by a  high board fence except at the extreme end, where it was met by a swinging  bridge topping a forty-foot chasm. That bridge led through a sparsely wooded  forest to a road running in a quite different direction from the one by which  the house was approached. As she strove to recall her memories of it, she  became more and more assured that her one and only opportunity for a successful  flight lay that way. Moved to joy at the thought, she bowed her head for one  wild moment in heartfelt thankfulness and then quickly drew the bolts of the  door which offered her this happy deliverance.</p>
  <p>She  did not mean to seek escape to-night, but an irresistible impulse, which quite  robbed her of her judgment, drove her to take a look into the yard and make  sure for herself that the bridge was still there and everything as she had last  seen it.</p>
  <p>But  when with the help of the wind she pulled open the heavy door and stood,  throbbing under the force of the gale, on the shallow step outside, she found  herself confronted by a darkness so hollow and so absolute that she felt as  though she had stumbled into a pit. But instead of retreating, if only to  procure a lantern, she took the one step down to the narrow walk which led  through grass and flowers to the edge of the plateau from which the bridge  extended. Would she be satisfied now? No, she must see the bridge, or if she  could not see it, must feel it with her foot or touch it with her hand. Once  sure of its presence there, she would return, take off her clothing and seek  refreshment.</p>
  <p>But  how was she to find her way in such absolute darkness? Alone with the dying  tempest, now moaning in fitful gusts, now shrieking a last protest in her ear,  she stood peering helplessly before her. Already her arms had gone out like  those of a blind person loosed upon an unknown road. She was conscious of a  great fear. All the solitude of her position had rushed upon her. She felt  herself lost, forsaken; yet she had no idea of turning back. If she could but  find some support&mdash;something upon which to lay her fingers. She thought of the  fence, and her courage revived. If she could but reach and follow that!</p>
  <p>There  were obstacles in her way. She was sure of this, for she remembered some of  them, and Elvira no more changed her garden than her house. But with care she  succeeded in getting around these, and soon she knew by the lessened force of  the wind that she was near, if not directly under, the high fence upon which  she depended for guidance. A few bushes&mdash;another unexpected obstacle, followed  by a bad stumble&mdash;separated her from the contact for which she had reached; then  by a final effort her fingers found the boards and she went eagerly on,  dragging herself through the wet without knowing it, and only stopping with a  sense of shock, when her hand, sliding from the boards, fell groping about in  midair with nothing to grasp at. She had come to the end of the fence and was  within a foot of the bridge&mdash;if the bridge was still there.</p>
  <p>But  her fears on this score were few, and she felt about with hand and foot till  the former struck the rail at her side, and the latter the narrow planking  spanning the gorge.</p>
  <p>She  hesitated now. Who would not? But the impulse which had led her thus far  continued to urge her on. She stepped upon the bridge and proceeded to cross  it, clinging to the rail with a feverish clutch, and feeling every board with  her foot before venturing to trust her full weight upon it. She found them  seemingly firm, and when about halfway across she stopped to listen for the  roar of the mountain stream which she knew to be rushing over its rocky bed  some forty awesome feet below her.</p>
  <p>She  heard it, but the swish of the trees lining the gorge was in her straining ears  and half drowned its sullen sound. With feelings impossible to describe, she  tossed up her arms to the skies, where a single brilliant star was looking  through the mass of quickly flying, quickly disintegrating clouds. Then she  sought again the safety of the guiding rail, and clinging desperately to it,  took one more step and stopped with a smothered shriek. The rail had snapped  under her hand and had gone tumbling down into the abyss. She heard it as it  struck, or thought she did, and for a moment stood breathless and fearing to  move, the world and all it held vanishing in semi-unconsciousness from heart  and mind. What was she but a trembling atom floating in an unknown void on the  fathomless sea of eternity! Then, as her mind steadied, she began to feel once  more the boards under her feet, and to hear the smiting together of the great  limbs wrestling in the depths of the forest. She even caught such a homely  sound as the violent slamming of the door she had left unlatched behind her;  and summoning up all her courage, which was not small when she was released  from her first surprise, she stepped firmly backward till she felt the rail  strong again under her clutch. Then she turned resolutely and retraced her  steps along the bridge and so across the plateau to the house whose light had  acted as a beacon to her whenever the door blew wide enough to let the one  inner beam be seen.</p>
  <p>When  she was inside again, she lingered for a long time in the darkening hall, her  slight form and whitened head leaning against the wall in a desolation such as  few hearts know. Then something within the woman flared up in a rekindled  flame, and she passed quickly into the room where she had left her lamp  burning; and blowing it out, she threw herself down on a couch and tried to  sleep.</p>
  <p>An  hour later the moon shone in upon her pale features and wild, staring eyes  upturned to meet it. Then it vanished, and she and the whole house were given  up again to darkness.</p>
  <p>She  had forgotten to eat, though the cupboards, in this well-stored house, were  quite full.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXVI"></a><b>XXVI<br>
    The Face In The Window</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this the place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;According  to our instructions, yes. The first house after the first turn to the right. We  took the first turn, and this is the first house. Romantic situation, eh? But a  bit lonesome for a city chap? Shall I help you down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  talking, Sweetwater, who was already in the road, held up his elbow to Mr.  Gryce, who slowly descended. It was early morning, and the glory of sunshine  was everywhere misleading the eye from the ravages of the night before; yet  neither of these two men wore an air in keeping with the freshness of renewed  life and the joyous aspect of exultant nature. There seemed to be an oppression  upon them both&mdash;a hesitation not common to either, and to all appearance without  cause.</p>
  <p>To  end what he probably considered a weakness, Sweetwater approached the door  staring somewhat blankly from the flat front of the primitive old house whose  privacy they were about to invade, and rapped on its weather-beaten panels,  first gently and then with quick insistence.</p>
  <p>There  was no response from within; no sound of movement; no token that he had been so  much as heard. Sweetwater turned and consulted his companion before making  another attempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  early. Perhaps she&rsquo;s not up yet,&rdquo; rejoined the old detective as he painfully  advanced. The storm of the preceding night had got into his bones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s something uncanny about this silence. She ought to be here;  but I&rsquo;m afraid she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sweetwater rapped again, this time with decided  vehemence.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  in one of the uncurtained windows a face appeared. They saw it, and both drew a  deep breath. The eyes were looking their way, but they were like ghost&rsquo;s eyes.  Without sight or speculation in them, they simply looked; then the face slowly  withdrew, growing ghastlier every minute, and the window stared on, but the  woman was gone. Yet the door did not open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hate to use force,&rdquo; objected Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>Before  answering, Mr. Gryce stepped to one side and cast a glance around the corner of  the house in the direction of the gorge opening in the rear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is something like a yard at the back,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;but the fence which shut  it in is so high and so protected by means of prickly underbrush that you would  have difficulty in climbing it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  so at this end,&rdquo; called out Sweetwater after a short run to the left. &ldquo;If we  get in at all,&rdquo; he remarked on coming back, &ldquo;it will have to be by the window  you see there with one pane knocked out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like that; I don&rsquo;t like any of it. But we can&rsquo;t stay out here any longer.  The looks of the woman herself forbid it. We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget that hollow stare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  said the woman who lived here was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It&rsquo;s a bad business, Sweetwater. Rap once more, and then if she doesn&rsquo;t come,  throw up the window and climb in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  did as he was bid, and meeting with no more response than before, thrust his  hand through the hole made by the broken pane; and finding the window had been  left unlocked, he pushed it up and entered. In another moment he appeared at  the front door, where Mr. Gryce joined him, and together they took their first  look at the small but surprisingly well-furnished interior.</p>
  <p>The  hall in which they stood was without staircase and had many of the appointments  of a room. Doors opened here and there along its length, and in the rear they  saw a closed one evidently leading into the yard. There was no one within  sight. One would have said that with the death and carrying out of the owner of  this little dwelling, all life had departed from it. Yet these two men knew  that life was there; and raising his voice, Mr. Gryce called out in the least  alarming way possible:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  Duclos!&rdquo; following this utterance of her name with an apology for the intrusion  and a prayer for one minute&rsquo;s interview.</p>
  <p>Silence  was his answer&mdash;no stir anywhere.</p>
  <p>Apprehensive  of they knew not what, the two detectives started simultaneously, one for the  door on their right, the other for that on the left. When they met again in the  ill-lighted hall, Mr. Gryce was shaking his head, but Sweetwater had lifted a  beckoning finger. Unconsciously moderating his step, Mr. Gryce followed him  through one room to the door of another which he saw standing partly open.</p>
  <p>Through  the crack thus made between the hinges, they could get a very fair glimpse of  what was going on inside. They saw a bed, and a woman kneeling beside this bed,  her eyes upraised in prayer. The look which had awed them at the window was  gone, and in its place was one so high and so full of religious faith that for  an instant they were conscious of the reversal of all their ideas.</p>
  <p>But  only for an instant; for while they waited, hesitating to break in upon her  evidently sincere devotions, she started to her feet and with a half-insane  look about her, disappeared from their view in the direction of the hall.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was after her in a twinkling; but by the time he and Mr. Gryce, each going his  separate way, had themselves reached the hall, it was to see the end door&mdash;the  one giving upon the plateau&mdash;closing behind her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;  called out Sweetwater, bounding briskly in her wake.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce said nothing but approached with hastening steps the door which  Sweetwater had left open behind him, and took a quick survey of the fenced-in  plateau, the bridge and the towering trees beyond, toward which she seemed to  be making.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  cannot escape,&rdquo; was his ready conclusion; and he shouted to Sweetwater to go  easy.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  who was in the act of setting foot upon the bridge down which she was running,  slacked up at this command and presently stopped, for she had stopped herself  and was looking back from a spot about halfway across, with the air of one  willing, at last, to hear what they had to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And what do you want of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you not Madame Duclos?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am Antoinette Duclos.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you must know why you are wanted by the police authorities of New York. Your  daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hand went up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  nothing to say&mdash;nothing. Will you take that for your answer and let me go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas,  madam, we cannot!&rdquo; spoke up Mr. Gryce in his calm, benevolent way. &ldquo;Miss Duclos&rsquo;  death was of a nature demanding an inquest. Your testimony, hard as it may be  for you to give it, is necessary for a righteous verdict. That is all we want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too much!&rdquo; she cried. And with a quick glance upward she took another step  or two along the bridge till she had reached the broken rail; and before  Sweetwater in his dismay could more than give a horrified bound in her  direction, she had made the fatal leap and was gone from their sight into the  gorge below.</p>

    From Lips Long Silent</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;This  finishes my usefulness as a detective. I have had my fill of horrors; all, in  fact, that my old age can stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus,  Mr. Gryce, as hours afterward he and Sweetwater turned their faces back toward  New York.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  appreciate your feelings,&rdquo; responded the latter, who had been strangely silent  all day, speaking only when directly addressed. &ldquo;I can assure you that in my  way I&rsquo;m as much cut up as you are. I wish now that I had made an attempt from  the rear to head off this distracted woman, even if I had been obliged to  scratch my hands to pieces tearing a board from the fence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would have done no good. She was determined to die rather than give up her  secret. I remember the look with which her sister-in-law warned me that she  would never survive a capture. But I thought that mere exaggeration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  after a moment of conscious silence on the part of both, the weary old man  added with bitter emphasis, &ldquo;Her testimony might&mdash;I do not say would&mdash;have  cleared away our suspicions of Director Roberts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  who was acting as chauffeur, slowed down his machine till it came to a  standstill at the side of the road. Then wheeling quietly about till he faced  his surprised companion, he remarked very gravely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gryce, I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to tell you this before, but the time has come for  you to know that Mr. Roberts&rsquo; cause is not so favorably affected, as you seem  to think, by this suicidal death of one who without doubt would have proved to  be a leading witness against him. I am sure you will agree with me in this when  I inform you that in pursuing the task you set me, I came upon <i>this</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thrusting  his hand into his pocket, he pulled out a large envelope from which he  proceeded to draw forth first the tattered square of what had once been a  cabinet portrait, and then a freshly printed proof of the same. Holding them  both up, he waited for the word that was sure to follow.</p>
  <p>It  came with all the emphasis he expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Roberts!  Director Roberts!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same, sir&rdquo;; and the eyes of the two detectives met in what was certainly one of  the most solemn moments of their lives.</p>
  <p>They  had paused for this short conference at a point where the road running for a  few yards on a level gave them a view of slope on slope of varying verdure,  with glimpses of the Hudson between. Glancing up, with a gesture of manifest  shrinking from the portrait which Sweetwater still held, Mr. Gryce allowed his  glance to run over the wonderful landscape laid out to his view, and said with  breaks and halts bespeaking his deep emotion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  my death here and now, following fast upon that of this unhappy Frenchwoman,  would avail to wipe out the evidence I have so laboriously collected against  this man, I should welcome it with gratitude. I shrink from ending my career  with the shattering of so fine an image, in the public eye. What lies back of  this crime&mdash;what past memories or present miseries have led to an act which  would be called dastardly in the most uninstructed and basest of our sex, I  lack the imagination to conceive. Would to God I had never tried to find out!  But no man standing where Roberts does to-day among the leaders of a great  party can fall into such a pit of shame without weakening the faith of the  young and making a travesty of virtue and honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet,  if he is guilty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is our business to pursue him to the end. Only, I like the man, Sweetwater. I  had a long talk with him yesterday on indifferent matters and I came away  liking him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was certainly something Sweetwater had not expected to hear, and it threw him  again into silence as he started up the machine and they pursued their course  home.</p>
  <p>Hard  as the day had been for Mr. Gryce, its trials were not yet over. He had left it  to Sweetwater to report the case to the New York authorities and had gone home  to rest from the shock of the occurrence and to prepare for that interview with  the Chief Inspector which he was satisfied would now lead to an even more  exacting one with the District Attorney.</p>
  <p>He  was met by a messenger from downtown who handed him a letter. He opened it  abstractedly and read the following:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Taylor is talking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had forgotten Mrs. Taylor. To have her thus brought forcibly back to mind was a  shock heightened, rather than diminished, by a perusal of the few connected  words which the careful nurse had transcribed as falling from her delirious  patient&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>They  were these:</p>
  <p>I  love but thee, <br>
  And thee will I love to eternity. </p>
  <p>The  exact lines, no more, no less, which Sweetwater had found written on the back  of the Swiss clock cherished by Mr. Roberts.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXVIII"></a><b>XXVIII<br>
  &ldquo;Romantic! Too Romantic!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Next  morning Mr. Gryce left his home an hour earlier than usual. He wished to have a  talk with Mrs. Taylor&rsquo;s nurse before encountering the Inspector.</p>
  <p>It  was an inconvenient time for a nurse to leave the sick-bed; but the matter  being so important, she was prevailed upon to give him a few moments, in the  little reception room where he had seated himself. The result was meagre&mdash;that  is, from her standpoint. All she had to add to what she had written him the day  before was the fact that the two lines of verse quoted in the note she had sent  him were Mrs. Taylor&rsquo;s first coherent utterance, and that they had been spoken  not only once but many times, in every kind of tone, and with ever-varying  emphasis. That and a dreamy request for &ldquo;The papers! the papers!&rdquo; which had  followed some action of her own this very morning comprised all she had to give  in fulfillment of the promise she had made him at the beginning of this  illness.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce believed her and rose reluctantly to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she is still very ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  ill, but mending daily; or so the doctor says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she talks again, as she is liable to do at any moment, do not check her, but  remember every word. The importance of this I cannot impress upon you too fully.  But do not by any show of curiosity endanger her recovery. She seems to be one  of the very best sort; I would not have her body or mind sacrificed on any  account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may trust me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  nodded, giving her his hand.</p>
  <p>But  as he was turning away, he looked back with the quiet remark: &ldquo;I should like to  ask a final question. You have been in constant attendance on this lady for  some time and must have seen many of her friends, as well as taken charge of  her mail and of any messages which may have been left for her. Has there been  anything in this experience to settle the doubt as to whether her talk of a  vision in which she saw her absent husband stricken simultaneously with the  poor child lying at that very moment dead at her feet simply delirium or a striking  instance of telepathy recording an accomplished fact? In other words, do you  believe her husband to be living or not living at the present time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a subject upon which I have not been able to form any opinion. I have heard  nothing, seen nothing to influence my mind either way. Some other people have  asked me this same question. If her mail contains any news, it is still in the  hands of the proprietor of the hotel. He has refrained from sending it up. She  has lived here, as you know, for a long while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  she no relative to share your watch or take such things in charge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen none. Friends she has in plenty, but no one who claims relationship  with her, or who raises the least objection to anything I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  seemed about to ask another question, but refrained and allowed her to depart  after some final injunction as to what she should do in case of certain  emergencies. Then he had a talk with the proprietor, which added little or  nothing to his present knowledge; and these duties off his mind, he went  downtown.</p>
  <p>As  he expected, he found the Chief Inspector awaiting him. The death of Madame  Duclos had added still another serious complication to the many with which this  difficult affair was already encumbered, and he was anxious to talk over the  matter with one who had been on the spot and upon whose impressions he  consequently could rely.</p>
  <p>But  when he heard all that Mr. Gryce had to say on the subject, he grew as serious  as the detective himself could wish, even going so far as to propose an  immediate ride over to the District Attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p>Fortunately,  they found that gentleman in and ready to listen, though it was evident he  expected little from the conference. But his temper changed as Mr. Gryce opened  up his theory and began to substantiate it with facts. The looks which he  exchanged with the Chief Inspector grew more and more earnest and inquiring,  and when Mr. Gryce reached that portion of his report which connected Mr.  Roberts so indisputably with the arrow, he called in his assistant and together  they listened to what Mr. Gryce had further to say.</p>
  <p>With  this addition to his audience, the old man&rsquo;s manner changed and became a trifle  more formal. He related the fact, not generally known, of Mr. Roberts&rsquo;  engagement to a young girl residing on Long Island, and how this was broken off  immediately after the occurrence at the museum, seemingly from no other reason  than the unhappy condition of mind in which he found himself, a condition added  to if not explained by the pertinacity with which he had haunted the morgue and  dwelt upon the image of the young girl who had perished under no random shot.</p>
  <p>Here  the old man paused, shrinking as much from what he had yet to say as they from  the hearing of it. It was not till the Chief Inspector had made him an  encouraging gesture that he found the requisite courage to proceed. He did so,  in these words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that the evidence I have thus far advanced is of a purely circumstantial  nature, capable, perhaps, of a more or less satisfactory explanation. But what  I have to add cannot be so easily disposed of. Connections have developed  between persons we thought strangers which have opened up a field of inquiry  which brings the doubts and surmises of an old detective within the scope of  this office. I do not know what to make of them; perhaps their full meaning can  only be found out here. Of this only I am assured. The gentleman whom it seems  presumptuous on my part to connect even in a casual way with crime has not  gained but lost by what I have to tell of Madame Duclos&rsquo; suicidal death. To  those who see no association between the two, it looks like the opening of a  new lead, but when I tell you that they knew each other, or at all events that  she knew him and in the way of actual hatred, it looks more like a deepening of  the old one. See here, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Opening  a package he had hitherto held in hand, he showed them Fredericks&rsquo;  fifteen-year-old photograph of Mr. Roberts, together with its mutilated  counterpart, and explained how the latter came to be in its present mutilated  condition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this is not all,&rdquo; he continued, as the remarks incident upon this proof of  deadly hatred on the part of the mother of the victim for the man whom  circumstances seemed to point out as her slayer subsided under the pressure of  their interest in what he had further to impart. &ldquo;As you will see after a  moment&rsquo;s consideration, this token of animosity does not explain Madame Duclos&rsquo;  flight, and certainly not her death, which, as the unhappy witness of it, I am  ready to declare was not the death of one driven to extremity from personal  fear, but by some exalted feeling which we have yet to understand. All that I  now wish to point out in its connection is the proof offered by this shattered  photograph, that Mr. Roberts was in some manner and from some cause a party to  this crime from which a superficial observation would completely dissociate  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the connecting link? How can we hope to establish it? That is what it has  now become my unfortunate duty to make plain to you. Carleton Roberts drawing a  bow to shoot an innocent schoolgirl is incredible. In spite of all I have said  and shown you, I do not believe him guilty of so inhuman an act. He drew the  bow, he shot the arrow, but&mdash;Here allow me to pause a moment to present another  aspect of the case as surprising as any you have yet heard. You are aware&mdash;we  all are aware&mdash;that the inquest we await has been held back for the purpose of  giving Mrs. Taylor an opportunity to recover from the illness into which she  has been thrown by what she saw and suffered that day. Gentlemen, this Mrs.  Taylor whom we all&mdash;I will not even exclude myself from this category&mdash;regarded  not only as a casual visitor to the museum, but a stranger to all concerned,  is, on the contrary, as I think you will soon see, more closely allied to the  seemingly dispassionate director than even Madame Duclos. The shock which laid  her low was not that usually ascribed to her, or even the one she so  fantastically offered to our acceptance; but the recognition of Carleton Roberts  as the author of this tragedy,&mdash;Carleton Roberts whom she not only knew well but  had loved in days gone by, as sincerely as he had loved her. This I now propose  to prove to you by what I cannot but regard as incontestable evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taking  from a small portfolio which he carried another photograph, unmounted this time  and evidently the work of an amateur, he laid it out before them. The silence  with which his last statement had been received, the kind of silence which  covers emotions too deep for audible expression, remained unbroken save for an  involuntary murmur or so, as the District Attorney and his assistant bent over  this crude presentation of something&mdash;they hardly knew what&mdash;which this old but  long trusted detective was offering them in substantiation of the well-nigh  unbelievable statement he had just made.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="fr100135-images/page318.png" width="800" height="476"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,  gentlemen,&rdquo; he went on, as he pointed to the following, &ldquo;is the copy of a label  pasted on the back of a certain Swiss clock to be seen at this very moment on  the wall of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; own bedroom in his home in Belport, Long Island. He  prizes this clock. He has been heard to say that it goes where he goes and  stays where he stays, and as it is far from a valuable one either from  intrinsic worth or from any accuracy it displays in keeping time, the reason  for this partiality must lie in old associations and the memories they invoke.  A love token. Can you not see that it is such from the couplet scrawled across  it? If not, just take a look at the initials appended to that couplet. May I  ask you to read them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  District Attorney stooped, adjusted his glasses and slowly read out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;C.  C. R.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton  Clifton Roberts,&rdquo; explained Mr. Gryce. Then slowly, &ldquo;The other two if you will  be so good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;E.  T.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ermentrude  Taylor,&rdquo; declared the inexorable voice. &ldquo;And written by herself. Here is her  signature which I have obtained; and here is his. Compare them at your leisure  with their initials inscribed according to the date there, sixteen years or  more ago. Now where were these two&mdash;this man and this woman&mdash;at the time just  designated? Alone, or together? Let us see if we can find out,&rdquo; pursued the  detective with a quiet ignoring of the effect he had produced, which revealed  him as the master of a situation probably as difficult and disconcerting as the  three officials hanging in manifest anxiety upon his words had ever been called  upon to face. &ldquo;Mr. Roberts was in Switzerland, as his housekeeper will be  obliged to admit on oath, she being an honest woman and a domestic in his  mother&rsquo;s house at the time. And Ermentrude Taylor! I have a witness to prove  where she was also! A witness I should be glad to have you interrogate. Here is  her name and address.&rdquo; And he slipped a small scrap of paper into the District  Attorney&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;What she will say is this, for I think I have very thoroughly  sounded her: First, that she is Mrs. Taylor&rsquo;s most intimate friend. This is  conceded by all who know her. Secondly, that while her intimacy does not extend  back to their girlhood days&mdash;Mrs. Taylor being an Englishwoman by birth and  remarkably reticent as to her former life and experiences&mdash;she has one story to  tell of that time which answers the question I have given you. She got it from  Mrs. Taylor herself, and in this manner. They were engaged in talking one day  about our Western mountains and the grandeur of scenery generally, when Mrs. Taylor  let fall some remark about the Alps, which led this friend of hers to ask if  she had ever seen them. Mrs. Taylor answered in the affirmative, but with such  embarrassment and abrupt change of subject that it was plainly apparent she had  no wish to discuss it. Indeed, her abruptness was so marked and her show of  trouble so great, she was herself disturbed by what might very easily give  offense, and being of a kindly, even loving disposition, took occasion when  next they met to explain that it was as a girl she had visited Switzerland, and  that her experiences there had been so unfortunate that any allusion which  recalled those days distressed her. This is all that ever passed between these  two on this subject, but is it not enough when we read this couplet, and mark  the combined initials, and recognize them as those of Carleton Roberts and  Ermentrude Taylor? But lest you should doubt even this evidence of an old-time  friendship so intimate that it has almost the look of a betrothal, I must add  one more item of corroborative fact which came to me as late as last night. In  a moment of partial consciousness, while the nurse hung over her bed, Mrs.  Taylor spoke her first coherent sentence since she fell into a state demanding  medical assistance. And what was that sentence? A repetition of this couplet,  gentlemen, spoken not once but over and over again, till even the nurse grew  tired of listening to it.</p>
  <p class="verse">&lsquo;I  love but thee, <br>
  And thee will I love to eternity.&rsquo;&ldquo; </p>
  <p>As  the last word fell from Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s lips, the District Attorney muttered a  quick exclamation, and sat down heavily in his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  coincidence that,&rdquo; he cried, with forced vivacity. &ldquo;The couplet is too little  known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  came from Mr. Gryce in dry confirmation. &ldquo;Mrs. Taylor, as well as her friends can  judge, is a woman of thirty-five or thirty-eight. If she went to Switzerland as  a girl, this would make her visit coincident, so far as we can calculate from  our present knowledge, with that of Carleton Roberts. For the surer advancement  of our argument, let us say that it was. What follows? Let the inscription of  this label speak for us. They met; they loved&mdash;as was natural when we remember  the youth and good looks of both, and&mdash;<i>they parted</i>. This we must concede,  or how could the experience have been one she could not recall without a  heart-break. They parted, and he returned home, to marry within the year, while  she&mdash;I do not think she married&mdash;though I have no doubt she looks upon herself as  a wife and forever bound to the man who deserted her. Women of her kind think  in this way of such matters, and act upon them too as is shown by the fact  that, on following him here, she passed herself off as a woman separated from  her husband. Changing the Miss before her name to Mrs., she lived under this  assumption for twelve years at her present hotel. In all that time, so far as I  can learn, she has never been visited by anyone of an appearance answering to  that of her former lover; nor have I any reason to think she ever intruded  herself on him, or made herself in any way obnoxious. He was married and  settled, and contrary to the usual course of men who step with one stride into  affluence, was living a life of usefulness which was rapidly making him a  marked man in public esteem. Perhaps she had no right to meddle with what no  longer concerned her. At all events, there is no evidence of her having done so  in all these fourteen years. Even after Mrs. Roberts&rsquo; death, all went on as  usual; <i>but</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Here Mr. Gryce became emphatic&mdash;&ldquo;when he turned his  attention to a second marriage and that with a very young girl&mdash;(I can name her  to you, gentlemen, if you wish) her patient soul may have been roused; she may  have troubled him with importunities; may have threatened him with a scandal  which would have interfered greatly with his political hopes if it had not  ended them at once. I can conceive such an end to her long patience, can&rsquo;t you,  gentlemen? And what is more, if this were so, and the gentleman found the  situation intolerable, it might account for the flight of that arrow as nothing  else ever will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both  men had started to their feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How!  It was not <i>she</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not she who was struck, <i>but it was she who was aimed at</i>. The young  girl merely got in the way. But before I enlarge upon this point,&rdquo; he continued  in lower tones as the two officials slowly reseated themselves, &ldquo;allow me to  admit that any proof of correspondence between these old-time lovers would have  added much to my present argument. But while I have no doubt that such an  interchange of letters took place, and that in all probability some one or more  of them still exist, Mrs. Taylor&rsquo;s illness and Mr. Roberts&rsquo; high position  prevent any substantiation of the same on our part. I must therefore ask you to  assume that it was in obedience to some definite agreement between them that  she came to the museum on that fatal morning and made her appearance in that  especial section of the gallery marked II. If this strikes you as inconceivable  and too presumptuous for belief, you must at least concede that we have ample  proof of his entire readiness for her coming. The bow brought up so many days  before from the cellar was within reach; the arrow under his coat; and his  place of concealment so chosen as to make his escape feasible the moment that  arrow flew from the bow. Had she entered that section alone&mdash;had the arrow found  lodgment in her breast instead of in that of another&mdash;nay, I will go even  further and say that had no cry followed his act, an expectation he had every  right to count upon from the lightning-like character of the attack,&mdash;he would  have reached the Curator&rsquo;s office and been out of the building before quick  discovery of the deed made his completion of this attempt impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the girl did cry out,&rdquo; remarked the Assistant District Attorney. &ldquo;How do you  account for that, since, as you say, it was not natural for one pierced to the  heart without warning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you see the big mistake we made,&mdash;Correy and all the rest of us. Had Miss  Willetts, or I should say, Mademoiselle Duclos, been the one to let out that  dolorous cry, the man just behind the partition would have been there almost in  time to see her fall. Correy, who started up the stairs at the first sound,  would have been at the gallery entrance before the man of the arrow could have  dropped the hanging over his retreating figure. But it was not from her lips,  poor girl, that this gasping shriek went up, but from those of the woman who  saw the deed and knew from whom the arrow came and for whom it was meant. How  do I know this? Because of the time which elapsed, the few precious minutes  which allowed Mr. Roberts to get as far away as the court. For she did not  voice her agony immediately. Even she, with her own unwounded heart keeping up  its functions, stood benumbed before this horror. Not till the full meaning of  it all had penetrated her reluctant brain did she move or cry out. How long  this interval was; whether three minutes were consumed by it, or five, we have  no means of telling. She, in her despair, would take no note of time, nor would  Mr. Travis, reeling in the opposite gallery under the shock of seeing all that  he loved taken from him in one awful minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  the detective turned with great earnestness toward the two officials.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  question of time has been, as I have repeatedly said, the greatest stumbling-block  we have encountered in our consideration of this crime. How could the assassin,  by any means possible, have got so far away from the pedestal, in the  infinitesimal lapse of time between the cry that was heard and the quick alarm  which followed. Now we know. Have you anything to say against this conclusion?  Any other explanation to give which will account for every fact as this does?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  answer came in a dubious gesture from the District Attorney and a half-hearted &ldquo;No&rdquo;  from his Assistant. They were both either too awed by the circumstance or too  fearful of mistake, to accept without a struggle an accusation of this grave  and momentous character against one of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; stamp and consequence.</p>
  <p>This  was no more than Mr. Gryce had expected, and while he realized that his  reputation as a detective of extraordinary insight in cases of an unusually  baffling nature trembled in the balance, he experienced a sudden distaste of  his work which almost drove him into renouncing the whole affair. But the habits  of a lifetime are not parted with so easily; and when the Chief Inspector  observed&mdash;evidently with the idea of goading him on&mdash;&ldquo;This seems to be mainly a  matter of conjecture, Gryce,&rdquo; his old self reasserted itself, and he answered  boldly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  acknowledge that; but conjecture is what in nine cases out of ten smoothes out  many of our difficulties. I have here a short statement made by myself, after  the most careful inquiries, of all that Mrs. Taylor and the untrapped director  did and said in the few difficult moments when they met face to face over the  body of his unfortunate victim. I will ask you to listen to a portion of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She  had not moved. After her one cry of horror which had brought a rush of  witnesses upon the scene, she remained fixed on her knees in the absorbed  introspection common to those brought suddenly face to face with a life and  death crisis. He, finding that his own safety demanded action suitable to his  position as a director, had entered with the crowd and now stood in her presence,  in face of his own diabolical work, in an attitude of cold courage such as  certain strong natures are able to assume under the pressure of great  emergencies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So  long as she was deaf to all appeal to rouse and explain the situation, he stood  back, watchful and silent; but when she finally roused and showed a disposition  to speak, his desperation drove him into questioning her in order to see how  much she understood of an attack which had killed a harmless stranger and let  herself go free.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He  asked her first if she could tell them from which direction came the arrow  which ended this young girl&rsquo;s life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She  made no reply in words; but glanced significantly at the opposite gallery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This  called from him the direct inquiry, &ldquo;Did you see anyone over there at the  moment this young girl fell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She  shook her head. Afterward she explained the denial by saying that she had been  looking down into the court.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But  he did not cease his inquiries. Turning to the people crowding about him, he  put the like question to them; but receiving no answer, a silence followed,  during which a woman suggested in tones loud enough for all to hear, that there  were no arrows on the other side of the court, but that the gallery where they  stood was full of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This  seemed to alarm Mrs. Taylor. Turning to the director, she asked whether he was  sure that the opposite gallery held no arrows and no bows; and when he replied  that nothing of the kind was to be found along its entire length, she proceeded  to inquire whether any such deed could be committed in a place so open to view,  without attracting the observation of some one wandering in court or gallery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This,  undoubtedly, to ascertain the full extent of his danger, before bestowing a  thought upon herself. But at his answer, given with the cold precision of a  thoroughly selfish man, that if anyone in the whole building had seen so much  as a movement in a spot so under suspicion, that person would have been heard  from by this time, she faltered and was heard to ask what he had in mind and  why the people about her looked at her so. He did not respond directly, but  made some remark about the police, which increased her alarm to the point of an  attempted justification. She said that it was true about the arrows, as anyone  could see by looking up at the walls. But where was the bow? No one could shoot  an arrow without a bow, and when some one shouted that if an arrow was used as  a dagger, one wouldn&rsquo;t need a bow, a sort of frenzy seized her and she acted  quite insane, falling at the young girl&rsquo;s side and whispering sentence after  sentence in her ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What  more was needed to stamp her as a mad woman in the eyes of the ordinary  observer? Nothing. But to you and me, with the cue just given, it has another  look. She had just seen the man whom she had herself spared from an accusation  which would have been his ruin accept in the coldest fashion an explanation  which left her own innocence in doubt. What wonder she succumbed to temporary  aberration! As will be remembered, she soon became comparatively calm again,  and so remained until in an interview I had with her a half hour or so later I  urged her, possibly with too much insistence, for some explanation of the  extreme agitation she had shown at the time, when she broke forth with the  remarkable statement that it was not the child, but her husband, she was  mourning, stricken to death, as she would have us believe, simultaneously with  the young and innocent victim then lying dead at her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of  course, such a coincidence was much too startling not to be regarded by us all  as the ravings of delirium; nor has anything occurred since in the way of  communication from, or in regard to the absent one, to show that this so-called  warning of death has been followed up by fact. But, if you test her action by  the theory I have just advanced, viz., that the man she called husband was at  that moment in the room with us and that these words were a plea to him&mdash;the  last appeal of a broken-hearted woman for the support she felt to be her  due&mdash;how the atmosphere of unreason and mystery clears itself. His suggestion  that what was needed there was an alienist, and the pitiful efforts she made to  exonerate herself without implicating him in the murderous event, fall  naturally into place, as the action of a guilty man and the self-denying  conduct of a devoted woman.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Romantic!  too romantic!&rdquo; objected the District Attorney. &ldquo;I should think we were  listening to one of Dumas&rsquo; tales.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dumas  got his greatest effects from life, or so I have been told,&rdquo; remarked the Chief  Inspector.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce sat silent.</p>
  <p>Suddenly,  the District Attorney observed with the slightest tinge of irony edging his  tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  presume you would find a like explanation for the messages she professed to be  sending to her husband, when engaged in babbling fool words into the dead girl&rsquo;s  ear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  He was there, mark you! He stood where he could both see and hear her. All she  said and all she did was by way of appeal to him for some token of regret, some  sign that he appreciated her reticence; and when she found that it was bringing  her nothing, she fainted away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ingenious,  very ingenious, Gryce. Had you failed to give us proofs connecting this idol of  the Republican party with the actual shooting, it would have been simply  ingenious and a quite useless expenditure of talent. But we have these proofs,  and while they are mainly circumstantial, they undoubtedly call upon us for  some recognition, and so we will hear you out whatever action we may take  afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  first I should like to ask Mr. Gryce one question,&rdquo; interposed his assistant.  Then addressing the detective: &ldquo;Two mysteries are involved in this matter. You  have given us a clever explanation of one of them, but how about the other?  Will you, before going further, tell us what connection you find between the  theory just advanced and the flight and ultimate suicide of Madame Duclos under  circumstances which point to a desire to suppress evidence even at the cost of  her life? It was not from consideration for Mr. Roberts, whom you have shown she  hated. What was it then? Have you an equally ingenious explanation for that  too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have an explanation, but I cannot say that it is altogether satisfactory. She  died but yesterday, and my opportunities have been small for any work since.  What I have learned was from her sister-in-law, whom I saw this morning.  Realizing that she will be obliged to give full testimony at the inevitable  inquest, she is at last ready to acknowledge that she has been aware for a long  time of a secret in Madame&rsquo;s life. That while she knew nothing of its nature,  she had always thought that it was in some manner connected with her prolonged  residence abroad. Whether it would also explain the meaning of her return at  this time and the seemingly inexplicable change made in her daughter&rsquo;s name  while <i>en route</i>, must be left to our judgment. Madame had told her  nothing. She had simply made use of their home, coming and going, not once, but  twice, without giving them the least excuse for her inexplicable conduct. A  hundred questions could not elicit more. But to one who like myself has had the  opportunity of observing this wretched woman at the moment of her supreme  distress an insight is given into her character, which suggests the only  plausible explanation of her action. Her sacrifice was one of devotion! She  perished in an exaltation of feeling. Love drove her to this desperate act. Not  the love of woman for a man, but the love which women of her profound nature  sometimes feel for one of their own sex. Mrs. Taylor was her friend&mdash;wait, I  hope to prove it&mdash;and to save her from experiencing the extreme misery of seeing  the man who was the joy as well as bane of her life suffer from the  consequences of his own misdeeds, Antoinette Duclos felt willing to die and  did. You smile, gentlemen. You think the old man is approaching senility.  Perhaps I am, but if the contention is raised that no connection has been shown  to exist between Mrs. Taylor and this foreign Madame, save such as was made by  the death of Madame&rsquo;s child, I must retort by asking who warned Madame Duclos  of the fatal occurrence at the museum in time for her to flee before even our  telephone messages reached her hotel? Gentlemen, there is but one person who  could have done this&mdash;our chief witness, Ermentrude Taylor. She alone had not  only the incentive, but the necessary opportunity. Coroner Price as well as  myself made a great mistake when we allowed Mrs. Taylor to go home alone that  day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely.&rdquo; This from the Chief Inspector. &ldquo;But if the information I have received  on this point is correct, she seemed at that time to be so entirely dissociated  with a deed whose origin had just been located in the opposite gallery, that  you have no real cause to blame yourselves in this regard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True;  our minds were diverted. But you are waiting for me to explain what I mean by  opportunity. Since my attention has been drawn to Mrs. Taylor again, I have  been making inquiries. The chauffeur who drove her to her hotel has been found,  and he admits that she stopped once on her way home, to buy some coffee. He  watched her as she went into the store and he watched her as she came out; and  he smelled the coffee. Happily, the interest he took in her as a sick woman  intrusted to his care was strong enough for him to remember the store. It was  one with two entrances, front and back; and next door to it there is a public  building with a long row of telephone booths on the ground floor. If I read the  incident aright, she bought her coffee, ordered it ground, slipped out at the  rear door and into the adjoining building, where, unnoticed and unheard, she  called up the Universal and got into communication with Madame Duclos. When she  returned it was by the same route. She did not forget her coffee nor give way  under the great strain to which she had subjected herself till she reached her  own apartment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  true, gentlemen; I will stake my reputation on it, unable as I am to explain  every circumstance, and close up every gap. Have you any further questions to  ask or shall I leave you to your deliberations?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXIX"></a><b>XXIX<br>
    A Strong Man</b></h2>
  <p>An  hour later when the Chief Inspector rose to depart, it was with the  understanding that until their way cleared and their duty in this matter had  become inevitable, no word of this business should reach the press, or even  pass beyond the three officials interested.</p>
  <p>Strange  to say, they were able to keep this compact, and days elapsed without any  public recognition of the new factor which had entered into the consideration  of this complicated crime.</p>
  <p>Then  a hint of what was seething in the official mind was allowed to carry its own  shock to the person most interested. Mr. Roberts was summoned to an interview  with Coroner Price. No reason was given for this act, but the time was set with  an exactness which gave importance to a request which they all felt the  director would not venture to disregard.</p>
  <p>Nor  did he. He came at the time appointed, and Coroner Price in welcoming him with  becoming deference could not but notice the great change which had taken place  in him since that night they stood together in the museum and saw the Indian  make the trial with bow and arrow which located the point of delivery as that  of the upper pedestal. In just what this change lay, the Coroner hardly knew,  unless it was in the increased grayness of his hair. Mr. Roberts&rsquo; face,  handsome as it was, was not an expressive one. Slight emotions made no  impression there; nor did he to-day present anything but a calm and dignified  appearance. Yet he was changed; and anyone who had not seen him since that  night must certainly observe it.</p>
  <p>The  Coroner, who was also a man of a somewhat stolid cut, proffered him a seat and  at once opened fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will pardon me any inconvenience I may have put you to, Mr. Roberts, when I  tell you that Coroner D&mdash; of Greene County, is anxious to have a few words with  you. He would have visited you at your home; but I induced him to see you here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coroner  D&mdash; of Greene County!&rdquo; Mr. Roberts was entirely surprised. &ldquo;And what business  can he have with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is in regard to the suicide of Madame Antoinette Duclos, committed, as you  know, a week since in the Catskills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  an extraordinarily sad affair, and of considerable moment I should judge, from  its seeming connection with the one previously occurring at our museum. The  girls&rsquo; mother, was she not? Grief evidently unseated her brain. But&mdash;&rdquo; here he  changed his position quietly but with evident effort:&mdash;&ldquo;in what manner am I  supposed to be in a position to help the Coroner in his inquiry into this case?  I was a witness, together with many others, of what happened after the accident  which took place at the museum; but I know nothing of Madame Duclos or of her  self-inflicted death, beyond what has appeared in the papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  papers! An uncertain guide, Mr. Roberts. You may not believe it,&rdquo; Coroner Price  remarked with a strange sort of smile, &ldquo;but there are secrets known to this  office, as well as to Police Headquarters, which never get into the most  enterprising journals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  this meant to startle the director, and did it succeed in doing so?</p>
  <p>It  may have startled him, but if so, he made no betrayal of the fact. His manner  continued to be perfectly natural and his voice under full control as he  replied that it would be strange if in a case like this they should give out  all the extraneous facts and possible clues which might be gathered in by their  detectives.</p>
  <p>This  was carrying the offense into the enemy&rsquo;s camp with a vengeance. But the  Coroner was saved replying by Mr. Roberts remarking:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this is not an answer to my question. Why should the Coroner of Greene County  want to see <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner  Price proffered him a cigar, during the lighting of which the former remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  certainly very odd. You say that you didn&rsquo;t know Madame Duclos.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  how should I? She was a foreigner, was she not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  a Frenchwoman, both by birth and marriage. Her husband, a professor of  languages, was located some sixteen years ago, in New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew him. Indeed, I find it hard to understand why I should be expected  to show any interest in him or his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I will tell you. You may not have known the Madame; but it is very certain that  she knew you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She?&rdquo;  This certainly unexpected blow seemed to make some impression. &ldquo;Will you give  me your reasons for such an assertion? Was the name Duclos a false one? Was her  name like that of her daughter, Willetts? If so, allow me to assure you that I  never heard of a Willetts any more than I have of a Duclos. That a woman of  whatever name and nationality should desert her child fills me with horror. I cannot  speak of her, dead though she be, with any equanimity. A mother and act as she  did! She herself was to blame, and only she for what happened to that beautiful  girl&mdash;so young&mdash;so sweet&mdash;so innocent. I have a weakness for youth. To me a girl  of that type is sacred. Had I been blessed with such a child&mdash;But there, I am  straying again from our point. What makes you say Madame Duclos knew me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  replying, the Coroner rose, and taking a small package from his desk, opened  it, and laid out before the astonished eyes of Mr. Roberts the freshly printed  photograph of himself with which we are so well acquainted, and then the  half-demolished one which for all its imperfections showed that it had been  originally struck off from the same negative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you recognize this portrait of yourself as one taken by Fredericks some dozen  years ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  But this other? This end and corner of what must have been my picture too,  where was <i>it</i> found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that is what I have called you here to learn. This remnant of what you have  just admitted to have been your photograph also was found in the very condition  in which you see it now, in the wastebasket of the room where Madame Duclos  lodged previous to her flight to the Catskills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This!  with the face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  that! With the face riddled out of it by bullets! She shot six into it at  intervals; waiting for the passing of an elevated train by her windows, in the  hope that the bigger noise would drown the lesser.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is nothing,&rdquo; was Mr. Roberts&rsquo; indignant comment, as he brushed the picture  aside. &ldquo;That was never my picture, or she wanted a target for her skill and  didn&rsquo;t care what she took. That is all I have to say to you or to the Coroner  of Greene County, on a matter in which I have no concern. I am sorry to  disappoint both of you, but it is so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  rose, and the Coroner did not seek to detain him. He merely observed, as the  director turned to go:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you heard the latest news about Mrs. Taylor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is improving rapidly. Soon she will be able to appear before the jury already  chosen to inquire into the cause and manner of Miss Willetts&rsquo; death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fine woman!&rdquo; came in a burst from the director&rsquo;s lips as he faced about for a  good-bye nod. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I have seen one I admired more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Coroner Price had nothing to say, he was stupefied.</p>
  <p>But  it was not so with Mr. Gryce, who entered immediately upon Mr. Roberts&rsquo;  departure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a jarring note,&rdquo; he remarked. Evidently he had heard the whole conversation. &ldquo;I  never for a moment imagined that he knew Madame Duclos. Any knowledge we gain  of her will have to come from Mrs. Taylor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a strong man. We shall find it difficult to hold our own against him if we are  brought to an actual struggle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he run the forefinger of his right hand so continuously into his right-hand  vest pocket?&rdquo; was Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s sole comment.</p>
  <p>By  which it looks as if he had seen as well as heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t notice it. Is the District Attorney prepared to make the next move? Mine  has failed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet. The game is too hazardous. We should only make ourselves ridiculous in the  eyes of the whole world if we should fail in an attack upon a man of such  national importance. After the two inquests and a letter I hope to receive from  Switzerland, we may be in a position to launch our first bomb. I don&rsquo;t  anticipate the act with any pleasure; the explosion will be something  frightful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  half you think is true, the unexpected confronting of him with Mrs. Taylor  should produce some result. That&rsquo;s what I reckon on now, if the business falls  first to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  reckon on nothing. Chance is going to take this thing out of our hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chance!  I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand myself; but this is a case which will never come into court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  differ with you. I almost saw confession in his face when he turned upon me at  last with that extravagant expression of admiration for the woman you say he  meant to kill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did his finger go so continuously to his vest pocket? When you answer that, I  will give a name to what I just called <i>chance</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    The Creeping Shadow</b></h2>
  <p>Mrs.  Taylor suffered a relapse, and the inquest which had been held back in  anticipation of her recovery was again delayed. This led to a like postponement  of an inquiry into the death of Madame Duclos; and a consequent let-up in  public interest which thus found itself, for the nonce, deprived of further  food on which to batten.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Mr. Gryce was not idle. Anxious to determine just how and where Madame Duclos&rsquo;  story fitted into the deeper and broader one of the museum crime, he made use of  his fast waning strength to probe its mysteries and master such of its details  as bore upon the serious investigation to which he was so unhappily committed.  When he had done this,&mdash;when he had penetrated, as it were, into the very heart  of the matter to the elimination of all doubt and the full establishment of his  own theory, it was felt that the time had come for some sort of positive action  on the part of those interested in the cause of justice.</p>
  <p>This  they decided should take the form of a personal interview between certain  officials and Mr. Roberts himself. A lesser man would have been asked to meet  the District Attorney in his office; but in a case of such moment where the  honor of one so prominent in many ways was involved it was thought best for them  to visit him in his own home. To do this without exciting his apprehension  while still making sure of his presence required some management. Various plans  were discussed with the result that a political exigency was brought into play.  The District Attorney asked Mr. Roberts for an interview for the purpose of  introducing to him a man whose influence could not fail to play an important  part in his future candidacy.</p>
  <p>He  did not name this man; but we will name him. It was the Chief Inspector.</p>
  <p>The  appointment was made and the day set. It was the following Monday. On Tuesday,  Coroner Price was to open his inquest.</p>
  <p>Did  Carleton Roberts see any connection between these two events?</p>
  <p>Who  can tell? The secrets of such a brain are not to be read lightly. If we possessed  Sweetwater&rsquo;s interest, and were to follow in secret fashion every action of the  director on the evening preceding this date, what conclusion should we draw in  this regard? How would we characterize his anticipations, or measure in our own  mind the possibilities of the future as felt by him?</p>
  <p>He  was very quiet. He ate his meal with seeming appetite. Then he took a look over  his whole house. From the carefulness with which he noted everything, the  changes which he had caused to be made in it were not without their interest  for him. Not a young man&rsquo;s interest, but yet an interest as critical and acute  as though he had expected it to be shared by one whose comfort he sought and in  whose happiness he would fain take part.</p>
  <p>This,  to Sweetwater, had he our vision, would have been incomprehensible from any  point of view; especially, had he seen what followed when the owner of all this  luxury returned to his library.</p>
  <p>There  was a picture there; a small framed photograph which occupied the post of honor  on his desk.</p>
  <p>It  showed a young and pretty face, untouched, as yet, by the cares or troubles of  this world. He spent a minute or so in looking at it; then he slowly lifted it,  and taking the picture from the frame, gave it another look, during which a  smile almost derisive gathered slowly on his lips. Before this smile had  altogether vanished, he had torn the picture in two and thrown the fragments  into the fire he had kindled early in the evening with his own hands.</p>
  <p>If  he stopped to watch these fragments burn, it was from abstraction rather than  from interest; for his step grew lighter as he left the fireplace. Whatever  this young girl&rsquo;s face had meant to him in days gone by was now as completely  dissipated as the little puff of smoke which had marked the end of her picture.</p>
  <p>If  he read the papers afterward it was mechanically. Night, and the one great  planet sinking in the West, appeared to appeal to him much more strongly than  his books or the more than usually stirring news of the day.</p>
  <p>He  must have stood an hour in his unlighted window, gazing out at the tumbling  waves lapping the shore.</p>
  <p>But  of his thoughts, God wot, he gave no sign.</p>
  <p>Later,  he slept.</p>
  <p>Slept!  with his hand under his pillow! Slept, though there were others in the house  awake!&mdash;or why this creeping shadow of a man outlined upon the wall wherever the  moon shone in, and disappearing from sight whenever the way led through  darkness.</p>
  <p>It  came from above; no noise accompanied it. Where the great window opened upon  the sea, lighting up the main staircase, it halted,&mdash;halted for several minutes;  then passed stealthily down, a shadowy silhouette, descending now quickly, now  slowly, as tread after tread is left behind and the great hall is reached.</p>
  <p>Here  there is no darkness. Open doors admit the light from many windows. A semi-obscurity  is all, and through this the figure passes, but hesitatingly still, and with  pause after pause, till a certain door is reached&mdash;a closed door&mdash;the only door  which is closed in this part of the house.</p>
  <p>Here  it stands&mdash;stands with profile to the panels, one ear against the wood. One  minute&mdash;two minutes&mdash;five minutes pass. Then a hand goes out and touches the  knob. It yields; yields without a sound&mdash;and a small gap is seen between the  door and its casing. This gap grows. Still no sound to disturb the tragic  silence. Stop! What was that? A moan? Yes, from within. Another? Yes. Then all  is quiet again. The dream has passed. Sleep has resumed its sway. The gap can  safely be made wider. This is done, and the figure halting without, passes in.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXXI"></a><b>XXXI<br>
    Confronted</b></h2>
  <p>Late  in the afternoon of the following day, the expected car entered Mr. Roberts&rsquo;  spacious grounds. It contained, besides the chauffeur, just two persons, the  District Attorney and the Chief Inspector. But it was followed by another in  which could be seen Mr. Gryce and a stenographer from the District Attorney&rsquo;s  office.</p>
  <p>The  house was finished by this time, and to one approaching through the driveway  presented a very attractive appearance. As the last turn was made, the sea  burst upon the view&mdash;a somewhat tumultuous sea, for the wind was keen that day  and whipped the waves into foam and froth from the horizon to the immediate  shore-line. To add to the scene, a low black cloud with coppery edges hovered  at the meeting of sea and sky, between which and themselves one taut sail could  be seen trailing its boom in the water.</p>
  <p>To  one of them&mdash;to Mr. Gryce, in fact, upon whose age Fancy had begun to work, this  battling craft presented an ominous appearance. It was doomed. The gale was too  much for it. Did he see in this obvious fact a prophecy of what lay before the  man upon whose privacy they were on the point of intruding?</p>
  <p>The  house was so arranged that to reach the main entrance it was necessary to pass  a certain window. As they did so, the figure of Mr. Roberts could be seen in  the room beyond moving about in an interested survey of its new furnishings and  present comfortable arrangement. To these men bent on an errand as far as  possible removed from interests of this kind, this evidence of Mr. Roberts&rsquo;  pleasure in the promise of future domesticity gave a painful shock, and raised  in the minds of more than one of them a doubt&mdash;perhaps the first in days&mdash;whether  a man so heavily weighted with a burden of unacknowledged guilt could show this  pleasurable absorption in his new surroundings.</p>
  <p>However,  when they came to see him nearer, and marked the stiffening of his body and the  slight toss-up of his head, as he noted the number and the exact character of  his guests, their spirits fell again, for he was certainly a broken man,  however much he might seek to disguise it. Yet there was something in this  extraordinary man&rsquo;s personality&mdash;a force or a charm wholly dissociated it may be  from worth or the sterling qualities which insure respect&mdash;which appealed to  them in spite of their new-found prejudice, and prevented any dallying with his  suspense or the use of any of the common methods usually employed in an  encounter of this kind.</p>
  <p>The  Chief Inspector to whom the first say had been given faced the director  squarely, as he saw how the hand which had just welcomed the District Attorney  fell at his approach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are surprised, Mr. Roberts, and rightly, to see me here not only in connection  with the Prosecuting Attorney of the City of New York, but with a member of my  own force. This, you will say, is no political delegation such as you have been  led to expect. Nor is it, Mr. Roberts. But let us hope you will pardon this  subterfuge when you learn that it was resorted to for the sole purpose of  sparing you all unnecessary unpleasantness in an interview which can no longer  be avoided or delayed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us sit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was his only answer.</p>
  <p>When  they had all complied, the District Attorney took the lead by saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am disposed to omit all preliminaries, Mr. Roberts. We have but one object in  this visit and that is to clear up to your satisfaction, as well as to our own,  certain difficulties of an unexpected nature which have met us in our  investigation into the crime in which you, as a director of the museum in which  it occurred, and ourselves as protectors of the public peace, are all vitally  concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo;  came in the most courteous manner from their involuntary host. &ldquo;Yet I fail to  understand why so many are needed for a purpose so laudable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  this will no longer surprise you, if you will allow me to draw your attention  to this chart,&rdquo; was the answer made to this by the District Attorney.</p>
  <p>Here  he took from a portfolio which he carried a square of paper which he proceeded  to lay out on a table standing conveniently near.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Roberts threw a glance at it and straightened again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain  yourself,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am quite at your service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  District Attorney made, perhaps, one of the greatest efforts of his life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that you recognize this chart, Mr. Roberts. You know when it was made and  why. But what you may not know is this: that in serving its original purpose,  it has proved to be our guide in another of equal, if not greater, importance.  For instance, it shows us quite plainly who of all the persons present at the  time of first alarm were near enough to the Curator&rsquo;s office to be in the line  of escape from the particularly secluded spot from which the arrow was  delivered. Of these persons, only one fulfills all other necessary conditions  with an exactness which excuses any special interest we may feel in him. It is  he who is tabulated here as number 3.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was said. Mr. Roberts was well acquainted with his own number. He did not have  to follow with his eye the point of the District Attorney&rsquo;s finger to know upon  whose name it had settled; and for a moment, surprise, shock,&mdash;the greatest  which can befall a man,&mdash;struggled with countless other emotions in his usually  impassive countenance. Then he regained his poise, and with a curiously  sarcastic smile such as his lips had seldom shown, he coldly asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  by what stretch of probability do you pick me out for this attack? There were  other men and women in this court, some very near me if I remember rightly. In  what are their characters superior, or their claims to respect greater, that  you should thus single me out as the fool or knave who could not only commit so  wild and despicable an act, but go so far in folly&mdash;let alone knavery&mdash;as to  conceal it afterward?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  evidence has been found against the others you have named which could in any  way connect them with this folly&mdash;or shall we say knavery, since you yourself  have made use of the word. But hard as it is for me to say this, in a presence  so highly esteemed, this is not true of you, Mr. Roberts, however high are our  hopes that you will have such explanations ready as will relieve our minds from  further doubts, and send us home rejoicing. Shall I be frank in stating the  precise reasons which seem to justify our present presumption?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  director bowed, the same curious smile giving an unnatural expression to his  mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me begin then,&rdquo; the other continued, &ldquo;by reading to you a list of questions  made out at Headquarters, as a test by which suspicion might be conscientiously  held or summarily dismissed. They are few in number,&rdquo; he added, as he unfolded  a slip of paper taken from his vest pocket. &ldquo;But they are very vital, Mr.  Roberts. Here is the first:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whose  hand carried the bow from cellar to gallery?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>The  director remained silent; but the oppression of that silence was difficult for  them all to endure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  the second:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Was  it the same that carried the arrow from one gallery to another?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>Still  no word; but Mr. Gryce, who was watching Mr. Roberts&rsquo; every move without  apparently looking up from the knob of his own cane, turned resolutely aside;  the strain was too great. How long could such superhuman composure endure? And  which word of all that were to come would break it?</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  the District Attorney was reading the third question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is  it possible for an arrow, shot through the loophole made by the curving in of  the vase, to reach the mark set for it by Mr. Travis&rsquo; testimony?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  question was answered when Mr. La Fl&egrave;che made his experiments from behind the  two pedestals. It could not have been done from the one behind which Mr. Travis  crouched, but was entirely possible from the rear of the other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a wave of his hand, Mr. Roberts dismissed this, and the District Attorney  proceeded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which  of the men and women known to be in the museum when this arrow was delivered has  enough knowledge of archery to string a bow? A mark can be reached by chance,  but only an accustomed hand can string a bow as unyielding as this one.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will pause there, Mr. Roberts. You may judge by our presence here to whose hand  and to whose skill we have felt forced to ascribe this wanton shooting of a  young and lovely girl. We wish to be undeceived, and stand ready to listen to  anything you may have to say in contradiction of these conclusions. That is, if  you wish to speak. You know that you will be well within your rights to remain  silent. Likewise that if you decide to speak, it will be our painful duty to  make record of your words for any use our duty may hereafter suggest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will speak.&rdquo; The words came with difficulty,&mdash;but they came. &ldquo;Ask what you will.  Satisfy my curiosity, as well as your own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  then, the bow. It was brought up from the cellar a fortnight or more before it  was used, and placed on end in the Curator&rsquo;s office, where it was seen more  than once by the woman who wipes up the floors. The person who did this cast a  shadow on the cellar wall,&mdash;that shadow was seen. Need I say more? A man&rsquo;s  shadow is himself&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  brought up the bow; but I do not see how that implicates me in the use which  was afterward made of it. My reasons for bringing it up were innocent enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stopped&mdash;not even knowing that he stopped. His eyes had been drawn to a small  article which the District Attorney had dropped from his hand onto the table.  It looked like an end of black tape; but whether it was this or something quite  different, it held the gaze of the man who was speaking, so completely that he  forgot to go on.</p>
  <p>The  hush which followed paled the cheeks of more than one man there. To release the  tension, the District Attorney resumed his argument, observing quietly, and as  if no interruption had occurred:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to the arrow and its means of secret transfer from one side of the building to  the other in the face of a large crowd, let me direct your attention to this  little strip of folded silk. You have seen it before. Surely, I am quite  justified in asking whether indeed you have not handled it both before and  after the lamentable occurrence we are discussing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see it for the first time,&rdquo; came from lips so stiff that the words were with  difficulty articulated. &ldquo;What is its purpose?&rdquo; he asked after a short pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hardly think it necessary to tell you,&rdquo; came in chilling response from the now  thoroughly disenchanted official. &ldquo;It looks like a loop, and notwithstanding  your assertion that you see it now for the first time, we have ample evidence  that it was once attached to the coat you wore on that fatal day and later  carefully severed from it and dropped on the museum floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  District Attorney waited, they all waited with eyes on the subject of this  attack, for some token of shame or indignation at this scarcely veiled  insinuation. But beyond a certain stillness of expression, still further  masking a countenance naturally cold and irresponsive, no hint was given that  any effect had been produced upon him by these words. The coal before it falls  apart into ash holds itself intact though its heart of flame has departed; so  he&mdash;or such was Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s thought as he waited for the District Attorney&rsquo;s  next move.</p>
  <p>It  was of a sort which recalls that soul-harrowing legend of the man hung up in an  iron cage above a yawning precipice, from under whose madly shifting feet one  plank after another is withdrawn from the cage&rsquo;s bottom, till no spot is left  for him to stand on; and he falls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hear that you are an expert with the bow and arrow, Mr. Roberts, or rather were  at an earlier stage of your career. You have even taken a prize for the same  from an Alpine Club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ah!  that told. It was such an unexpected blow; and it showed so much knowledge. But  the man who thus beheld his own youth brought up in accusation against him  quickly recovered; and with an entire change of demeanor, faced them all and  spoke up at last quickly and defiantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,  I have shown patience up till now, because I saw that you had something on your  minds which it might be better for you and possibly for me to be rid of. This  affair of Miss Willett&rsquo;s death is, as all must acknowledge, baffling enough to  strain even to the point of folly any effort made to explain it. I had sympathy  with your difficulties, and have still enough of that sympathy left, not to  express too much indignation at what you are pleased to call your suspicions. I  will merely halt for the moment your attempts in my direction, by asking, what  have you or anybody else ever seen in me to think I would practise my old-time  skill on a young and beautiful stranger enjoying herself in a place so dear to  my heart as the museum of which I have been a director now these many years? Am  I a madman, or a destroyer of youth? I love the young. This inhuman death of  one so fair and innocent has whitened my locks and seared my very  heart-strings. I shall never get over it; and whatever evidence you may have or  think you have, of my having handled bow and arrow in that museum gallery, it  must fall before the fact of my natural incapability to do the thing with which  you have charged me. No act possible to man is more in contradiction to my  instincts, than the wanton or even casual killing of a young girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the Inspector who spoke, and the emphasis which he gave to his words lifted  the director&rsquo;s head again into its old self-reliant poise. But the silence  which followed was so weighted with possibilities of something yet to be said  by this portentous holder of secrets, that it caused the nobly lifted head  slowly to droop again and the lips which had opened impulsively to close.</p>
  <p>Were  the words coming&mdash;the words which might at a stroke pull down the whole fabric  of his life, past, present and to come?</p>
  <p>In  his excited state of mind he seemed already to hear them. Doom was in their  sound, and the world, once so bright, was growing dark about him&mdash;dark!</p>
  <p>Yet  how could these men know? And if they did why did they not speak? And they did  not; they did not. There was silence in the air, not words; and life for him  was taking on once more its ancient colors, when sharp and merry through the  heavy quiet there rang out the five clear calls of a cuckoo clock from some  near-by room. One, two, three, four, five! Jolly reminder of old days! But to  the men who listened, the voice of doom spoke in its gladsome peal, whether the  ears which caught it were those of accuser or accused. Old days were not the  days to be rejoiced in at a moment so perilous to the one and so painful to the  others.</p>
  <p>With  the cessation of the last shrill cry, the Inspector repeated the phrase:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you, Mr. Roberts. But how about the woman who was troubling you with  demands you had no wish to grant? Miss Willetts, as you choose to call her,  though you must know that her name is Duclos, was not the only person in the  line of the arrow shot on that day from one gallery to the other. Perhaps this  weapon of destruction was meant for one it failed to reach. Perhaps&mdash;but I have  gone far enough. I should not have gone so far if it had not been my wish to  avoid any misunderstanding with one of such undoubted claims to consideration  as yourself. If you have explanations to offer&mdash;if you can in any way relieve  our minds from the responsibilities which are weighing upon us, pray believe in  our honest desire to have you do so. There may be something back of appearances  which has escaped our penetration; but it will have to be something startlingly  clear, for we know facts in your life which are not open to the world at large,  I may even say to your most intimate friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As,  for instance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Mrs. Taylor is no stranger to you, even if Mademoiselle Duclos was. We have  evidence you will find it hard to dispute that you knew and&mdash;liked each other,  fifteen years or so ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evidence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Incontrovertible,  Mr. Roberts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Attested  to by her? I do not believe it. I never shall believe it, and I deny the  charge. The ravings of a sick woman,&mdash;if it is such you have listened to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  advise you to stop there, Mr. Roberts,&rdquo; interjected the District Attorney. &ldquo;Mrs.  Taylor has said nothing. Neither has Madame Duclos. What the former may say  under oath I do not know. We shall both have an opportunity to hear to-morrow,  when Coroner Price opens his inquest. She is in sufficiently good health now, I  believe, to give her testimony. Pray, say nothing.&rdquo; Mr. Roberts had started to  his feet. &ldquo;Do nothing. You will be one of the witnesses called&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  he stopped, meeting with steady gaze the wild eyes of the man who was staring  at him, staring at them all in an effort to hold them back, while his finger  crept stealthily and ever more stealthily toward his right-hand vest-pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would dare,&rdquo; he shouted, then suddenly dropped his hand and broke into a low,  inarticulate murmur, harrowing and dreadful to hear. To some it sounded like a  presage to absolute confession, but presently this murmur took on a  distinctness, and they heard him say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should be glad to have five minutes&rsquo; talk with Mrs. Taylor before that time. In  your presence, gentlemen, or in anybody&rsquo;s presence, I do not care whose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did  he know&mdash;had he felt whose step was in the hall, whose form was at the door? If  he did, then the agitation which in another moment shook his self-possession  into ashes was that of hope realized, not of fear surprised. Ermentrude Taylor  entered the room and at the sight of her he rose and his arms went out; then he  sank back weak and stricken into his chair, gazing as if he could never have  his fill at her noble countenance luminous with a boundless pity if not with  the tenderness of an unforgotten love.</p>
  <p>When  she was near enough to speak without effort and had thanked the gentlemen who  had made way for her with every evidence of respect, she addressed him in quite  a natural tone but with strange depths of feeling in her voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it you want to say to me? As I stood at the door, I heard you tell these  gentlemen that you would like to have a few minutes&rsquo; talk with me. I was glad  to hear that; and I am ready to listen to&mdash;<i>anything</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pause she made before uttering the last word caused it to ring with double  force when it fell. All heads drooped at the sound and the lines came out on  Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s face till he looked his eighty-five years and more. But what  Carleton Roberts had to say at this critical moment of his double life was not  at all what they expected to hear.</p>
  <p>Rising,  for her eyes seemed to draw him to his feet, he cried in the indescribable tone  of suppressed feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shadows  are falling upon me. My interview with these gentlemen may end in a way I  cannot now foresee. In my uncertainty as to how and when we may meet again, I  should like to make you such amends as opportunity allows me. Ermentrude, will  you marry me&mdash;now&mdash;to-night, before leaving this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  low cry escaped her. She was no more prepared for this astounding offer than  were these others. &ldquo;Carleton!&rdquo; came in a groan from her lips. &ldquo;Carleton!  Carleton!&rdquo; the word rising in intensity as thought followed thought and her  spirits ran the full gamut of what this proposal on his part meant in past,  present and future. Then she fell silent and they saw the great soul of the  woman illumine a countenance always noble, with the light of a purpose  altogether lofty. When she spoke it was to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  recognize your kindness and the impulse which led to this offer. But I do not  wish to add so much as a feather&rsquo;s weight to your difficulties. Let matters  remain as they are till after&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took a quick step toward her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if my heart is full of regret?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Not if I recognize in you now the  one influence left in this world which can help me bear the burden of my own  past and the threatening collapse of my whole future?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she replied, with an access of emotion of so elevated a type it added to rather  than detracted from her dignity. &ldquo;It is too much or it is not enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  head drooped and he fell back, throwing a glance to right and left at the two  officials who had drawn up on either side of him. It was an expressive glance;  it was as if he said, &ldquo;You see! she knows as well as you for whom the arrow was  intended&mdash;yet she is kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  in an instant later he was before her again, with an aspect so changed that  they all marveled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had hoped,&rdquo; he began, then stopped. Passion had supplanted duty in his  disturbed mind; a passion so great it swept everything before it and he stood  bare to the soul before the woman he had wronged and under the eyes of these  men who knew it. &ldquo;Life is over for us two,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whether your presence  here is a trap in which I have been caught and from which it is hopeless for me  to extricate myself; or whether it is by chance or an act of Providence that we  should meet again with eager ears listening and eager eyes watching for such  tokens of guilt as will make their own course clear, true it is that they have  got what they sought; and whatever the result, nothing of real comfort or honor  is left for either you or me. Our lives have gone down in shipwreck; but before  we yield utterly to our fate, will you not grant me my prayer if I precede it  by an appeal for forgiveness not only for old wrongs but for my latest and  gravest one? Ermentrude, I entreat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ah,  then, they were witness to the fascination of the man, hidden heretofore, but  now visible even to the schooled spectators of this tragedy of human souls. The  tone permeated with pathos and charm, the look, the attitude from which all  formality had fled and only the natural grace remained, all were of the sort  which sways without virtue and rouses in both weak and strong an answering  chord of sympathy.</p>
  <p>The  woman in whom it probably awakened a thousand memories trembled under it. She  drew back, but her whole countenance had softened, revealing whatever of native  charm she also possessed. Would she heed his prayer? If she did not, they could  well be silent. If she did&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  the woman gave no sign of yielding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cease,  Carleton,&rdquo; came in stern reply&mdash;stern for all the approach to concession in her  manner. &ldquo;If your life and my life are both over, let us talk of other things  than marriage. When one faces death, whether of body or spirit, one clings to  higher hopes than those of earth or its remaining interests. If my forgiveness  will help you to this end, you have it. I have had but one aim in life since we  parted, and that was to see your higher self triumph over the material one. If  that hour has come or is coming, my life needs no other consolation. In having  that, I possess all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man who listened&mdash;the men who listened&mdash;stood for a moment in awe of the nobility  with which she thus expressed herself. Then the only person present whom she  seemed to see burst forth with a low cry, saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall not be disappointed. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  there she hushed him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. And he seemed to understand and was  silent.</p>
  <p>What  did this mean?</p>
  <p>The  District Attorney betrayed his doubt; the Chief his, each in a characteristic  way. The former frowned, the latter tapped his breast absently with his  forefinger while looking askance at Mr. Gryce, who in his turn took up some  little object from the desk beside which he was standing and to it confided  whatever surprise he felt at this proof of some uncommunicated secret shared by  these two, of which he had not yet become possessed. Then he again looked up  and the glances of the three men met. Should they attempt to sound this new  mystery of mutual understanding to which as yet they had received no clue? No,  the inquest would do that. Neither this man nor this woman could stand a close  examination. He would weaken from despair, she from the candor of her soul.  They would wait. But ah, the tragedy of it! Even these men hardened by years of  contact with every species of human suffering and crime were openly moved. If  they needed an excuse, surely they could find it in the superior abilities and  attainment of the man upon whom justice was about to wreak its vengeance. And  yet, what more despicable crime had they ever encountered in the long line of  their duty. The youth and innocence of the real victim and the worth of the  intended one only added to its wickedness and shame. It was this thought which  again steeled their hearts.</p>
  <p>Meantime  the two upon whom they now redirected their attention had attempted no further  speech and made no further move. She had said No to something he was willing to  concede, and he had accepted that no as final. Had this brought him any relief?  Possibly. And she? Had it had a like effect on her? Hardly. Though her aspect  was one of calm resignation, her physical powers were perceptibly failing. This  in itself was alarming, and determined them not to subject her any longer to an  interview which might rob her of all strength for the morrow. Accordingly, the  District Attorney, addressing Mr. Roberts, suggestively remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Taylor is showing fatigue. Would it not be better for you to say at once while  she is yet in a condition to remain with us, whether you prefer to make a  public statement of your case or leave it to unfold itself in the ordinary  manner through the two impending inquests and the busy pen of the reporter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,  am I under arrest? Am I to leave this house&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to-night. An officer will remain here with you. To-morrow&mdash;after the inquest,  perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will make a statement. I will make it now. I wish to be left in peace to-night,  to think and to regret.&rdquo; Then turning to her, &ldquo;Ermentrude, a woman who has  served me and my family for twenty-five years is at this very moment in the  rear of the house. Go to her and let her care for you. I have business  here,&mdash;business of which I am sure you approve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Carleton. And remember that I shall be put upon my oath to-morrow. The questions  I am asked I must answer&mdash;and truthfully,&rdquo; she added, with a look as full of  anguish as inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be truthful myself,&rdquo; he assured her, and again their eyes met.</p>
  <p>After  a while she gave a stumble backward, which Mr. Gryce perceiving, held out his  arm and assisted her from the room.</p>
  <p>But  once in the hall he felt the clinch of her fingers digging into his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there no hope?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Must I live&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he interrupted kindly, but with the authority given him by his relations to  this case. &ldquo;You have won his heart at last, and he speaks truly when he says  that to you and to you alone can he look for comfort, wherever the action of  the law may leave him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shivered; then glowed again with renewed fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; she said; and they passed on.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXXII"></a><b>XXXII<br>
  &ldquo;Why Is That Here?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>They  waited while he wrote. A sinister calm quite unlike that which the victim of  his ambition had shown under the stress of equal suffering if not equal guilt  had subdued his expression to one of unmoved gloom, never to be broken again.</p>
  <p>As  word after word flowed from the point of his pen upon the paper spread out  before him, the two officials sitting aside in the shadow watched for the  flicker of an eyelash, or a trembling of the fingers so busy over their task.  But no such sign of weakening did they see. Once only did he pause to look  away&mdash;was it into the past or into futurity?&mdash;with a steady, self-forgetful gaze  which seemed to make a man of him again. Then he went on with his task with the  grimness of one who takes his last step into ignominy.</p>
  <p>We  will follow his words as he writes, leaving them for the others to read on  their completion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  Carleton Roberts, in face of an inquiry which is about to be held on the death  of her who called herself Angeline Willetts, but whose real name is as I have  since been told Angeline Duclos, wish to make this statement in connection with  the same.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was at my hand she died. I strung the bow and let fly the arrow which killed  this unfortunate child. Not with the intention of finding my mark in her  innocent bosom. She simply got in the way of the woman for whom it was  intended&mdash;if I really was governed by intent, of which I here declare before God  I am by no means sure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child was a stranger to me, but the woman in whose stead she inadvertently  perished I had known long and well. My wrongs to her had been great, but she  had kept silence during my whole married life and in my blind confidence in the  exemption this seemed to afford me, I put no curb upon my ambition which had  already carried me far beyond my deserts. Those who read these lines may know  how majestic were my hopes, how imminent the honor, to attain which I have  employed my best energies for years. Life was bright, the future dazzling.  Though I had neither wife nor child, the promise of activity on the lines which  appeal to every man of political instinct gave me all I seemed to need in the  way of compensation. I was happy, arrogantly so, perhaps, when without warning  the woman I had not seen in years, who,&mdash;if I thought of her at all, I honestly  believed to be dead&mdash;wrote me a letter recalling her claims and proposing a  speedy interview, with a view to their immediate settlement. Though couched in  courteous terms, the whole letter was instinct with a confidence which  staggered me. She meant to re&euml;nter my life, and if I knew her, openly. Nothing  short of bearing my name and being introduced to the world as my wife would  satisfy her; and this not only threatened a scandal destructive of my hopes,  but involved the breaking of a fresh matrimonial engagement into which I had  lately entered with more ardor I fear than judgment. What was I to do? Let her  have her way&mdash;this woman I had not seen in fifteen years,&mdash;who if at the age of  twenty had seemed to my enthusiastic youth little short of a poet&rsquo;s dream, must  be far short of any such perfection now? I rebelled at the very thought. Yet to  deny her meant the possible facing of consequences such as the strongest may  well shrink from. And the time for choice was short. She had limited her patience  to a fortnight, and one day of that fortnight had already passed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have in my arrogant manhood sometimes credited myself with the possession of a  mind of more or less superiority; but I have never deceived myself as to the  meretricious quality of the goodness with which many have thoughtlessly endowed  me. I have always known it was not even up to that of men whose standards fall  far short of the highest integrity. But never, till that hour came, had I  realized to what depths of evil my nature could sink under a disappointment  threatening the fulfillment of my ambitious projects. Had there been any  prospect of escape from the impending scandal by means usually employed by men  in my position, I might have given my thoughts less rein and been saved at least  from crime. But these were not available in my case. She was not a woman who  could be bought. She was not even one I could cajole. Death only would rid me  of her; kindly death which does not come at call. This is as far as my thoughts  went at first. I was a gentleman and had some of a gentleman&rsquo;s feelings. But  when my sleep began to be disturbed by dreams, and this was very soon, I could  not hide from myself toward what fatal goal my thoughts were tending. To be  freed from her! To be freed from her! dinned itself in my ears, sleeping or  waking, at home or abroad. But I saw no plain road to this freedom, for our  paths never crossed and my honor as well as safety demanded that the coveted  result should be without any possible danger to myself. Cold, heartless  villain! you say. Well, so I was; no colder nor more heartless villain lives  to-day than I was between the inception of my purpose and its diabolical  fulfillment in the manner publicly known.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  true is this that, as time went on, my ideas cleared and the plan for which I  was seeking unfolded itself before me from the day I came upon a discarded bow  lying open to view in the museum cellar. The dreams of which I have spoken had  prepared me for this sudden knowledge. The woman who blocked my way and against  whom I meditated this crime was connected in my mind with Alpine scenery and  Alpine events. It was at Lucerne I had first met her, young and fresh, but  giving no promise of the woman she has since become; and in the visions which  came and went before my eyes, it was not herself I saw so much as the  surroundings of those days, and the feats of prowess by which I had hoped to  win her approbation. Among these was the shooting at a small target with a bow  and arrow. I became very proficient in this line. I shot as by instinct. I  could never tell whether I really took aim or not, but the arrow infallibly hit  the mark. In my dreams I always saw it flying, and when this bow came to hand a  thought of what the two might accomplish came with it. Yet even then I had no  real idea of putting into practice this fancy of a distempered brain. I brought  the bow up from the cellar and hid it unstrung in the Curator&rsquo;s closet, more  from idle impulse I fondly thought, than from any definite purpose. Another day  I saw the Curator&rsquo;s keys lying on his desk and took them to open a passage to  the upper floor. But for all that, I felt sure that I would never use the bow  even after I had thrust it near to hand behind the tapestry masking the secret  entrance to this passage. One dreams of such things but they do not perpetrate  them. I might approach the deed, I might even make every preparation for its  accomplishment, but that did not mean that the day would ever come when I  should actually loose an arrow from this bow against a human breast. More than  once I laughed at the mere idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the devil knew me better than I knew myself. Impelled by these same instincts,  I answered the letter sent me with the assurance that I would surely see her,  but I did not name any day, intuitively knowing that what I dreamed of doing  but certainly should not do required a certain set of circumstances not easily  to be met with. Instead, I bade her show herself in the second section of the  southern gallery, every Tuesday and Friday at the exact hour of noon. If at the  moment the two hands of the clock came together, she saw me on the lower step  of the main staircase, she was to know that I was free to talk and would soon  join her. If she did not see me there, she was to return home and come another  day. She answered that she would come but once, and set the day. This was  startling to my pride, but in a way it brought me a sense of relief. To wait  till all was propitious might mean continual delays. The very fact of my  uncertainty as to whether or not I should have the courage of my wishes at the  critical moment made an indefinite prolongation of my present condition  undesirable. Better one straight risk and be done with it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was to wait two weeks. Why she exacted so long and seemingly unnecessary a  delay, I do not know. Before I saw her, I thought it was from a sheer desire to  make me suffer; now I know it was not for that. However, it did make me suffer,  from the alternate weakening and strengthening of my resolve. When the day  came, the most trivial of circumstances would have deterred me from what still  had the nature of a dream to me. Unhappily, everything worked for its  fulfillment. There had never been fewer persons in the building at the noon  hour; nor had there been a time during the past two weeks when the Curator was  more completely occupied in a spot quite remote from his office. As I tried the  door leading up the little winding staircase to the one back of the tapestry  where the bow lay, and found it, just as I had left it, unlocked, I had a sense  for the first time that the courage concerning which I had had so many doubts  would hold. At that moment I was a murderer in heart and purpose, whatever I  was after or have been since. As I recognized this fact, I felt my face go pale  and my limbs shake from sheer horror of myself. But this weakness was  short-lived and I felt my blood flowing evenly again when having slipped into  my place behind the upper pedestal I peered through my peep-hole in a search  for her figure in the spot where I had bidden her await me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was not there, but then it was not quite twelve, though the noon hour was so  near she must be somewhere in the gallery and liable at any minute to cross my  line of vision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was fifteen years, as I have already said, since I had seen her; and I had no  other picture of her in my mind than the appearance she had made as a girl,  coarsened by time and disappointment. Why I should have looked for just this  sort of change in her, God knows, but I did expect it and probably would not  have recognized her if I had passed her in the court. But I was not worrying  about any mistake I might make of this kind. All I seemed to fear was that at  the critical moment some one would pass between us on my side of the gallery. I  never thought of anyone passing in front of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had picked out Section II as the place where she was to show herself, because  it was in a direct line with the course an arrow would take from a sight behind  the vase. I had bade her to look for me in the court, and that would bring her forward  to the balustrade in front. A knot of scarlet ribbon at her breast was to  distinguish her. But the spot I had thus chosen for her, and the spot I had  chosen for myself had this disadvantage; that while I could see straight to my  mark from the peep-hole I have mentioned, I could see nothing to right or left  of that one line of vision. Why I did not realize the hazard involved in this  fact I do not know. Enough that my whole thought was centered on the lookout I  was keeping and it was with a shock of surprise I suddenly saw the whole scene  blotted from my view by the passing by of some one on my own side of the  gallery. This must have been the Englishman who found his vantage-point from  behind the other pedestal. He went by quickly, and as the opening cleared once  more, I beheld the woman for whom I was waiting appear in the spot selected.  For an instant I was dazzled. I had not expected to see so noble a figure; and  in that instant a cloud came before my eyes, my resolution failed,&mdash;I was almost  saved&mdash;she was almost saved&mdash;when instinct got the better of my judgment, and the  arrow flew just as that young creature bounded forward in her delight at seeing  her steamer admirer watching her from my side of the court.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  shock of thus beholding a perfect stranger fall under my hand benumbed me, but  only for an instant. In the two weeks of intolerable waiting through which I  had just passed, I had so forcibly impressed upon my consciousness the exact  course I was to pursue from the instant the arrow left the bow that I went  about the same automatically. Pulling out the edge of the tapestry, I slipped  behind it, dropping my bow in the doorway left open for my passage. This caused  me no thought and awakened no fears. But what took all the nerve I possessed,  and gave me in one awful moment a foretaste of the terror and despair awaiting  me in days to come, was the opening of the second door&mdash;the one leading into the  Curator&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  might I not be forced to encounter when the knob to this was turned! Some strolling  guest&mdash;Correy the attendant&mdash;or even the guard who was never where he was needed  and always where he was not! For anyone to be there of sufficient intelligence  to note my face and the place from which I came meant the end of all things to  me. It was not necessary for this imaginary person to be in the room. To be  within sight of it was enough. But this fear&mdash;this horror of impending  retribution&mdash;did not make me hesitate or delay my advance a single instant.  Everything depended upon my being one of the crowd when the first alarm was  raised. So with the daring of one who in escaping a present danger hurls  himself knowingly into another equally perilous, I pushed open the door and  entered the office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was empty! Fortune had favored me thus far. Nor was there anyone in the court  beyond, near enough or interested enough to note my presence or observe any  effort I might make at immediate departure. With the hope riding high within my  breast that I should yet reach the street before my crime was discovered, I made  for the nearest exit. But I was not destined to reach it. When I was only some  half a dozen paces from the great door, Correy&rsquo;s cry rang loudly through the  building, with the result that all egress was shut off, and I was left, with no  other aid than my own assurance, to face my hideous deed with all its appalling  consequences.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  it served me, you have seen. Steeled by a sense of my own danger, I was able to  confront the woman whom I had so deeply wronged,&mdash;whom I had even endeavored to  kill,&mdash;and ply her with those questions upon whose answers depended not only my  honor, but my very life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  cold-blooded absorption in my own security, and her almost superhuman  devotedness, must have given the Powers cognizant of mortal lives a new lesson  in human nature. Never has a greater contrast been shown between self-seeking  man and self-forgetful woman. But deeply as I was impressed by the  steadfastness and magnanimity of her spirit, nay by the woman herself, I have  been less oppressed by the great debt I owed her than by the thought, growing  more intolerable every day, that in my frenzied struggle against fate I had cut  short the existence of a young and lovely girl whose right to live was beyond  all comparison superior to my own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  now, as the shadows fall thickly about me and the last page of my dishonorable  existence awaits to be turned, my mortal wound is this: that I must leave to  loneliness and unspeakable grief the great-souled woman who has seen into the  heart of my crime and yet has forgiven me. All else of anguish or dread is  swallowed up in this one over-mastering sorrow. To her my heart&rsquo;s thanks are  here given; to her my last word is due. May she find in it all that her soul  calls for in this hour of supreme disaster: repentance equal to my sin, and a  recognition of her worth, which, late as it is for her comfort, may lead to her  acceptance of the consolation yet to be meted out to her from eternal sources.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  was all. The pen dropped from his hand and he sat inert, almost pulseless, in  the desolation of a despair known only to those who, at a blow, have sunk from  the height of public applause into the depths of irretrievable ignominy.</p>
  <p>The  District Attorney, who was a man of more feeling than was usually supposed,  contemplated him in compassionate silence for a moment, then gently&mdash;very gently  for him&mdash;leaned forward and drew from under the unresisting hands the scattered  sheets which lay in disorder before him, and passed them on to his  stenographer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read,&rdquo;  said he; but immediately changed his mind and took them back. &ldquo;I will read them  myself. Mr. Roberts, I must ask you to listen. It is right for you to know  exactly what you have written before you affix your signature to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Roberts bowed mechanically, but he looked very weary.</p>
  <p>The  District Attorney began to read. It is a matter of doubt whether Mr. Roberts so  much as heard him. Yet the reading went on, and when the last word was reached,  the District Attorney, after a pause during which his eye had consulted that of  the Chief Inspector, remarked in a kindly tone and yet with an emphasis  impossible to disregard:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that you have made no mention of Madame Duclos in this relation of the  cause and manner of her young daughter&rsquo;s death. Is it possible that you are  ignorant of the part she played in your affairs or the reasons she had for the  suicide with which she terminated her life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing of the woman but that she was the mother of the girl who&mdash;&rdquo; he  hesitated, then added with a gesture of despair, &ldquo;fell under my hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  District Attorney said nothing in reply, he simply waited. But no denial or  further admission came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was a friend of Mrs. Taylor,&rdquo; suggested the Chief Inspector as the silence grew  somewhat oppressive. &ldquo;An old friend; a friend of her early days; do you not  remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  tormentors went no further. Why harass him for an item of knowledge which the  morrow would certainly bring to light. Instead, they hurried through the  remaining formalities, adding to the reading already made a capitulation of  such answers as he had given to their questions, and witnessing, while he  signed both papers.</p>
  <p>This  done, he was left for a moment in peace, while the two officials drew aside  into the embrasure of the window for a momentary conference.</p>
  <p>He  seemed to notice the hush, for he roused from the torpor into which he was  again about to sink, and glanced cautiously about him. The stenographer was  busy with his papers, and the other two stood with their backs to him. If help  was to come it must come now. This he realized, with a sudden graying of his  face which took from it the last vestige of that youthfulness which had been  its distinguishing feature; and the finger which had fumbled from time to time  in his vest-pocket stole thither once more, bringing forth a little vial which  in another moment he raised to his lips.</p>
  <p>Was  there no one to see? No one to stop him?</p>
  <p>No,  the stenographer was closing up his bag; and the two officials deep in  conversation. He could drain the last drop unseen.</p>
  <p>But  the sound of the little vial crashing upon the hearthstone whither he had flung  it broke the quiet and startled the District Attorney forward in a doubt  bordering upon terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the fragments that had just missed the ash  heap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  contained oblivion,&rdquo; was the answer given him in steady tones. &ldquo;Do you wonder  that I sought it? Nothing can save me. I have two minutes before me. I would  dedicate them to <i>her</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  head fell forward on his hands. The clock on the mantel struck. Could it be  that when the second hand had circled its small disc twice&mdash;</p>
  <p>This  was the thought of the District Attorney, but not of the Chief Inspector. He  had advanced to the desk where Mr. Roberts was still sitting, and remarked with  a gravity exceeding any he had hitherto shown:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Roberts, I have a great disappointment for you. This little vial of yours which  held poison yesterday contained nothing but a few drops of harmless liquid  to-day. The change was made in the night, by one suspicious of your intention.  You will have to face the full consequences of your crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carleton  Roberts&rsquo; arms collapsed and his face fell forward upon them, and they heard a  groan. Then in the short silence which followed, another and a very different  sound broke upon their ears. Seven clear calls from the cuckoo-clock rang out  from the room beyond, followed by a woman&rsquo;s smothered cry.</p>
  <p>It  was the one ironic touch the situation had lacked. It pierced the heart of  Carleton Roberts and started him in anguish to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that I should have let that thing of evil shriek out the  wicked hours from day to day, only to torment her now with old remembrances!  Why did I not crush it to atoms long ago? Why did I leave it hanging on my wall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a dash he was in the hall. In another instant he was at the door of his  bedroom, followed by the two officials crowding closely up behind him.</p>
  <p>Would  they find her there? Yes; where else should she be, she whom this call from the  past might almost draw from the grave! She was there, but not in the spot where  they had expected to see her, nor in that state of collapse of which her former  weakness had given promise. Apart from Mr. Gryce, with her form drawn up to its  full height she stood, with her finger pointing not at the cuckoo-clock as  would seem most natural, but at a small newspaper print of the dead girl&rsquo;s face  pinned up on another wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  is that here?&rdquo; she cried in a passionate inquiry which ignored every other  presence than that of him who must heed and answer her. &ldquo;Carleton, Carleton,  why have you pinned that young girl&rsquo;s face up opposite your bed where you can  see it on waking, where it can look at you and you at it&mdash;Or&mdash;&rdquo; here checked by a  sudden thought she broke off, and her tone changed to one of doubt, &ldquo;perhaps  you did not put it there yourself? Perhaps its presence on your wall is a trick  of the police to startle you into betrayal. Was it? Was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Ermentrude.&rdquo; The words came slowly but firmly. &ldquo;I put it there myself. I  thought it would haunt me less than if left to my imagination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  in a low tone which perhaps reached no other ears than hers:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know what it does to me; or what I see in it. Something besides youth  and beauty. Something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  She had him by the arm. &ldquo;Forget it; these men are listening&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  with a convulsive movement, he broke from her hold, and in so doing his eyes  fell on a mirror confronting him from the opposite side of the room. Two faces  were visible in it, his own and that of his young victim pictured in the print  hanging on the wall behind him. They seemed alive. Both of them seemed alive,  and as he saw them thus in conjunction, the sweet, pure countenance of the  child he had instinctively mourned, peering at him over his guilty shoulder&mdash;the  sweat started on his forehead and he uttered a great cry. Then he stood still,  swaying from side to side, the eyes starting from his head in a horror  transcending all that had gone before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  him away!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Out of the room! Let him remain anywhere but here. I  pray you; I entreat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he was not to be moved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ermentrude,&rdquo;  he whispered; &ldquo;they say her name was Duclos. She gave her name as Willetts.  What <i>was</i> her name? You know the truth and can tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="XXXIII"></a><b>XXXIII<br>
    Again The Cuckoo-Clock</b></h2>
  <p>Then  to the wonder and admiration of all, this extraordinary woman showed her full  strength and the inexhaustible power she possessed over her own emotions. With  a smile piteous in its triumph over a suffering the depths of which they were  just beginning to sound, she held his gaze in hers and quietly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have driven me to the wall, Carleton. If I answer, nothing remains to us of  hope or honor; nothing upon which to stay our souls but a consciousness of  truth. Shall we let all go and meet our fate as people should who stand on a  desolate shore and see the whole world roll away from before them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;What  was her name?&rdquo;</i> </p>
  <p>At  his look, at this repetition of his question, she straightened up, and  addressed herself to Mr. Gryce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were astonished and regarded me curiously when at the sound of that foolish  little clock I entered this room. That little clock means everything to me,  gentlemen.&rdquo; Here she surveyed them one after the other with her proud and  candid eye. &ldquo;It is the one witness I have&mdash;is it not, Carleton?&rdquo; she asked,  turning quickly upon him. &ldquo;You have not failed me in this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shook  his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  witness to what I am still ready to ignore, if such is your will, Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Terror!  terror far beyond anything they had seen in him yet, paled his cheek and made  his face almost unrecognizable; but he could still speak, and in the murmur he  let fall she heard no word of protest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I ask one of you to take down that clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a few minutes it lay on the table to which she had pointed. Mr. Gryce who had  at that moment in his pocket a copy of the inscription pasted on its back,  expected her to turn it over and show them the token of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; and her  united initials.</p>
  <p>But  it was not this she had in mind. Though she took up the clock, she did not turn  it round, only looked at it steadily, her trembling lips and a tear&mdash;the first  they had seen&mdash;testifying to the rush of old memories which this simple little  object brought back to her long suffering heart. Then she laid it down again  and seemed to hesitate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to get at the works inside,&rdquo; she appealed to them with a helpless accent. &ldquo;Can  you tear off the back? That would be the quickest way. But no, I know a  quicker,&rdquo; and lifting the clock again she turned it upside down and shook it.</p>
  <p>They  heard&mdash;what did they hear? No one could say, but when she again reversed it,  there fell out upon the table and rolled to the floor a small gold circlet.  Lifting it, Mr. Gryce held it out to her. Taking it, she carried it over to the  District Attorney and placed it in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  the inscription inside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did so, and looking quickly up, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is a wedding ring! Yours! You believe yourself to have been married to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>was</i> married to him in Switzerland. The marriage was legal; he knows it, he  acknowledges it, or why should he keep this ring. I have endured seeing him put  another woman in my place. I have kept silence for years; but when he asks the  right name of the child shot down in the museum, and asks it in a way which  compels answer, then I must make known my rightful claims. For that child was  not only mine, but <i>his</i>; born after he left me, and reared without his  knowledge, first in this country and then in France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  breaking down now utterly, she fell on her knees sobbing out her soul at the  feet of him from whose honor she had torn the last poor, pitiful shred.</p>
  <p>As  for him, he said nothing; even his lips refused the smallest cry. Only his hand  which had hung at his side went to his heart; and thus he stood  swaying&mdash;swaying, till he finally fell forward into the arms she suddenly threw  out to receive him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton!  Carleton!&rdquo; she wailed, searching for consciousness in his fast glazing eye. &ldquo;It  was to show you your child that I made the appointment at the museum. Not for  myself. Oh, not for myself, but for your sake, that you might have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Useless;  all useless.</p>
  <p>He  was dead.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>Would  she have had it otherwise? Would any of them? When they were quite sure of the  fact, she placed the ring in his still warm hand; then she solemnly put it on  her finger, and turning, faced them all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not blame me too much for this final blow I gave him. He had already seen the  truth in that mirror over there. His face&mdash;look at it and then at this picture  of her taken after death, and see the resemblance! It is showing plainer every  minute. It was the something which had worried and eluded him. Nothing could  have kept back the truth from him after that one glimpse he caught of himself  and her in the mirror. I loved him. Mine is the grief; you will let me stay  here with him to-night. To-morrow I will answer all questions.&rdquo;</p>

    The Bud&mdash;Then The Deadly Flower</b></h2>
  <p>You  who have read thus far will care little for the legalities which followed the  events just related, but you may wish to know to a fuller extent some of the  facts in Ermentrude Taylor&rsquo;s life which led to this tragic end of all her  hopes.</p>
  <p>Her  story is twofold, the portion connecting her with Carleton Roberts being  entirely dissociated from that which made her the debtor of Antoinette Duclos.  Let me tell the latter first, as it preceded the other, and tell it in  episodes.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>Two  girls stood at one end of a long walk of immemorial yews. At the other could be  seen the advancing figure of a man, young, alert, English-clad but unmistakably  foreign. They were school girls and bosom friends; he their instructor in  French; the walk one attached to a well-known seminary. When they had entered  this walk, it had been empty. Now it held for one of them&mdash;and possibly for the  other, too&mdash;a world of joy and promise;&mdash;the world of seventeen. Innocent and  unthinking, neither of them had known her own heart, much less that of her fellow.  But when in face of that approach, eye met eye with an askance look of eager  question, revelation came, crimsoning the cheeks of both, and marking an epoch  in either life.</p>
  <p>Noble  of heart and tender each toward the other, they were yet human. Arm fell from  arm, and with an equally spontaneous movement, they turned to search each the  other&rsquo;s countenance, not for betrayal,&mdash;for that had already been made&mdash;but for  those physical charms or marks of mental superiority which might attract the  eye or win the heart of a man of the ideality of this one.</p>
  <p>Alas!  these gifts, for gifts they are, were much too unequally distributed between  these two to render the balance at all even.</p>
  <p>Ermentrude  was handsome; Antoinette was not.</p>
  <p>Ermentrude  had besides, what even without beauty would have made her conspicuous to the  eye, the figure of a goddess and the air of a queen. But Antoinette was small  and had to feel secure and in a happy mood to show the excellence of her mind  and the airy quality of her wit.</p>
  <p>Then,  Ermentrude had money and could dress, while Antoinette, who was dependent upon  an English uncle for everything she possessed, wore clothes so plain that but  for their exquisite neatness, one would never dream that she came from French  ancestry, and that ancestry noble.</p>
  <p>Yes,  she had that advantage; rank was hers, but not the graces which should  accompany it. More than that, she had nothing with which to support it. Better  be of the yeoman class like Ermentrude, and smile like a duchess granting  favors. Or so she thought, poor girl, as her meek regard passed from the friend  whose attractions she had thus acknowledged to the man whose approbation would  make a goddess of her too.</p>
  <p>He  was coming&mdash;not with his usual indifferent swing, but eagerly, joyously, as  though this moment meant something to him too. She knew it did. Small memories  rushing upon her, made no doubt of that. But why? Because of Ermentrude or  because of herself? Alas! she could recall nothing which would answer that.  They were much together; he had scarcely ever seen them separate. It might be  either&mdash;Hardly alive from suspense, she watched him coming&mdash;coming. In a moment  he would be upon them. On which would his eyes linger?</p>
  <p>That  would tell the tale.</p>
  <p>In  an anguish of ungovernable shyness, she slipped behind the ample figure of her  friend till only her fluttering skirt betrayed her presence. Perhaps she was  saved something by this move; perhaps not. She did not see the beam of joy  sparkling in his eye as he greeted Ermentrude; but she could not but mark the  heaviness of his step as he passed them by and wandered away into the shadows.</p>
  <p>And  that she understood. Ermentrude had not smiled upon him. To him, the moment had  brought pain.</p>
  <p>It  was enough. Now she knew.</p>
  <p>But  why had not Ermentrude smiled?</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>A  dormitory lighted only by the moon! Two beds close together; in one a form of  noble proportions, and in the other the meagre figure of a girl almost buried  from sight among pillows and huddled-up blankets. Both are quiet save for an  occasional shudder which shakes the bed of the latter. Ermentrude lies like the  dead, though the moonlight falls full upon her face blanching it to the aspect  of marble. Even her lashes rest moveless on her cheek.</p>
  <p>But  she is not sleeping; she is listening&mdash;listening to the sobs, almost inaudible,  which now and then escape from the beloved one at her side. As they grow  fainter and fainter and gradually die away altogether till stillness reigns  through the whole dormitory, she rouses and bending forward on her elbow, looks  long and lovingly at the wet brow of her sleeping mate. She then sinks back  again into rigidity, with a low moan, ending in the whispered words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  does not love,&mdash;not yet. A slight thing will turn him. Did I not see him glance  back twice, and both times at her? The look with which she greeted him was so  wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>A  village street in Britanny; a parish church in the distance; two women bidding  each other farewell amid a group of wedding-guests, gay as the heavens are  blue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Au  revoir!</i>&rdquo; was the whisper breathed by the bride into the ear of the other. &ldquo;<i>Au  revoir</i>, my Ermentrude. May you have a happy year in Switzerland!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Au  revoir</i>! little Madame. <i>You</i> will be happy I know in those United  States to which you are going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  the tears stood in the eyes of both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will write?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will write.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the bride did not seem quite satisfied. Glancing about and finding her young  husband busy with his adieux, she drew her friend apart and softly murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is something I must say,&mdash;something I must know, before the sea divides us. You  remember the day we all left school and you went home and I came to Britanny?  Ermentrude, Achille tells me that on that day he sought the whole house over  for you till he came upon you in one of the classrooms; and that you whom I had  sometimes seen so sad were very gay and told him between laughing and crying  that you were bidding a solemn farewell to all the nooks and corners of the old  seminary, because your fianc&eacute; awaited you at home, and there would be no coming  back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  meant my music.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not know that, Ermentrude,&rdquo; and here she laid her hands upon the other&rsquo;s  shoulders, drawing back as she did so to look earnestly up into her face. &ldquo;Was  that done for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were too near for anything but the truth to pass from eye to eye. Ermentrude  tried to laugh and utter a quick <i>No, no!</i> but the little bride was not  deceived. Again upon her face there appeared that wonderful look of hers, which  made her face for the moment verily beautiful, and unclasping her hands, she  threw them about the other&rsquo;s neck, whispering in awed tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you loved him! loved him too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  after a moment of silence dear to both their hearts, she drew back to give her  friend one other look, and quietly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  heart is mine now, Ermentrude, wholly and truly mine. And so you would have it  be, I am sure. Life looks fair to me and very sweet; but however fair, however  sweet, that life is yours if ever you want it and when you want it. The time  may come&mdash;one never knows&mdash;when I can pay you back this debt. Till then, let  there be perfect trust and perfect love between us. Give me your hand upon  it&mdash;not just your lips&mdash;for I speak as men speak when they mean to keep their  word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Their  eyes met, their hands clasped; then the bridegroom drew away his bride, and  Ermentrude turned with bowed head and glistening eyes, to enter upon the new  life awaiting her in ways she had yet to tread.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>The  second series of episodes opens with the meeting of a man and woman on a rustic  bridge spanning a Swiss chasm. They are strangers to each other, yet both  instinctively pause and a flush of intuitive feeling dyes the cheek of each.</p>
  <p>The  eternal, ever-recurring miracle has happened. He sees Woman for the first time,  though he had thought himself in love before and had wandered thus far in an  effort to forget. So, likewise, with her. She had had her fancies, or rather  her one fancy; but when in strolling along this road ahead of her party she saw  rising between her and the glorious landscape which had hitherto filled her eye  the fine masculine head and perfect figure of Carleton Roberts, this fancy  floated from her mind like the veriest thistledown, leaving it free to expand  in fuller hopes and deeper joys than visit many women even when they think they  love.</p>
  <p>Alas!  why in that instant of mutual revelation had not the further grace been given  them of quick catastrophe shutting the door upon a future of which neither  could then dream or sense the coming doom.</p>
  <p>It  was not to be.</p>
  <p>He  passed, she passed, and for the time the look they gave each other was all; but  the world had been glorified for them both&mdash;and Destiny waited.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good  looks? Yes; but nothing else; very ordinary connections, very. A little money,  true. Her uncle, whom by the way I judge you have not seen, will leave her a  few thousands; but meanwhile he is a fixture&mdash;will not leave her or let her  leave him, which is a misfortune since in a social way he is simply impossible.  No sort of match for you, Roberts. Cut and run while there is time; that&rsquo;s my  advice to you, given in the most friendly spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you. As I have but just met Miss Taylor, don&rsquo;t you think such advice is a  little premature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t. She is a woman who must be loved or left; that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ve heard me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did  Carleton Roberts heed these words? No. What man in the thrall of his first  romance ever did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  love me, Ermentrude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love you, Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  a day, for a month or for a year?&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forever,&rdquo;  she answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a long time,&rdquo; he murmured, with his eyes on a little clock hanging in the shop  window before which they had stopped in one of their infrequent walks together.  &ldquo;A long time! That foolish little clock will beat out the hours of its short  life and go the way of all things, before we shall hardly have entered upon the  soul&rsquo;s &lsquo;forever.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  clock will last our lifetime, Carleton. Afterward, love will not be counted by  hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  she said this she turned her face his way and he saw it in its full flower with  the light of heaven upon it. In later years he may have forgotten the emotions  of that moment, but they were the purest, the freest from earthly stain that he  was ever destined to know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will love you <i>forever</i>,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;That little clock shall be my  witness.&rdquo; And he drew her into the shop.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cuckoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ermentrude  glanced up; the clock hung on her wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  she murmured, &ldquo;each hour it will speak to me of him and his words,&rdquo; then  softly, like one adream in Paradise:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love but thee, And thee will I love to eternity.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Such  was the event to her. What was it to him? Let us see:</p>
  <p>A  hotel room&mdash;a view of Pilatus, but with its top lost in enveloping clouds.</p>
  <p>Seated  before it with pen in hand above a sheet of paper, Carleton Roberts eyes these  clouds but does not see them; he is hunting in his brain for words and they do  not come. Why? His mother&rsquo;s name is on the page and he has only to write that  she has been quite correct in her judgment as to the unfitness of the marriage  he had had in mind:&mdash;that youth should mate with youth and that if she could see  the glorious young girl whose acquaintance he had made here, she would be  satisfied with his new choice which promised him the fullest happiness. Why  then a sheet yet blank and a hesitating hand, when all it had to do was to  write?</p>
  <p>Who  can tell? Man knows little of himself or of the conflicting passions which sway  him this way or that, even when to the outward eye, and possibly to the inner  one as well, action looks easy.</p>
  <p>Did  he feel, without its reaching the point of knowledge, that this mother of  keenest expectation and highest hope would not be satisfied with what this  charming but undeveloped girl of middle class parentage would bring him? Or was  there, deep down in his own undeveloped nature, a secret nerve alive to  ambitions yet unnamed, to hopes not yet formulated, which warned him to think  well before he spoke the irrevocable word linking a chain which, though twined  with roses, was nevertheless a chain which nothing on earth should have power  to break.</p>
  <p>He  never sounded his soul for an answer to this question; but when he rose, the  paper was still blank. The letter had not been written.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I  do not like secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  for a little while, Ermentrude. My mother is difficult. I would prepare her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Uncle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  of Uncle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  made me take an oath to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  oath?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I would not leave him while he lived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you could do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could do nothing else. He&rsquo;s a sick man, Carleton. The doctors shake their heads  when they leave him. He will not live a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  year? But that&rsquo;s an eternity! Can you wait, can I wait a year?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  loves me and I owe everything to him. Next week we go to Nice. These are days  of parting for you and me, Carleton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Parting!  What word more cruel. She saw that it shook him, and held her breath for his  promise that she should not be long alone. But it did not come. He was taking  time to think. She hardly understood his doing this. Surely, his mother must be  very difficult and he a most considerate son. She knew he loved her; perhaps  never with a more controlling passion than at this moment of palpitating  silence.</p>
  <p>As  she smiled, he caught her to his breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have yet a week,&rdquo; he cried, and left her hurriedly, precipitately.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>It  was their last ride and they had gone far&mdash;too far, Ermentrude thought, for a  day so chilly and a sky so threatening. They had entered gorges; they had  skirted mountain streams, had passed a village, left a ruined tower behind, and  were still facing eastward, as if Lucerne had no further claims upon them and  the world was all their own.</p>
  <p>As  the snows of the higher peaks burst upon their view, she made an attempt to  stop this seeming flight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  uncle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He will be counting the hours. Let us go back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  Carleton Roberts spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  mile,&rdquo; he whispered, not because he feared being overheard by their driver, but  because Love&rsquo;s note is instinctively low. &ldquo;You are cold; we shall find there a  fire, and dinner&mdash;and&mdash;Listen, Ermentrude,&mdash;a minister ready to unite us. We are  going back, man and wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear, it is quite understood. Letters are urging my return to New York. Your  uncle is holding you here. I cannot face an uncertain separation. I must feel  that you are mine beyond all peradventure&mdash;must be able to think of you as my  wife, and that will hold us both and make it proper for you to come to me if I  cannot come to you, the moment you are free to go where you will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why this long ride, this far-away spot? Why couldn&rsquo;t a minister be found in  Lucerne? Is our marriage to be as secret as our engagement? Is that what you  wish, Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear; for a little while, just for a little while, till I have seen my mother,  and rid our way of every obstacle to complete happiness. It will be better.  When one has promised to love <i>forever</i>, what are a few weeks or months.  Make me happy, dear. You have it in your power to do so. Happy! When once I can  whisper &lsquo;wife,&rsquo; the world will not hold a happier man than I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did  she yield because of her own great longing? No, it was by that phrase he caught  her: <i>The world will not hold a happier man than I</i>.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>Mountains!  Icy peaks, with sides heavy with snow! And so near! Almost they seemed to meet  across the narrow valley. She gave them one quick glance, then her eyes and her  heart became absorbed in what she could see of this Alpine village, holding up  its head in the eternal snows like an edelweiss on the edge of a glacier.</p>
  <p>It  was to be the scene of her one great act in life; the spot she was entering as  a maiden and would leave as a wife. What other spot would ever be so  interesting! To note its every detail of house and church would not take  long&mdash;it was such a little village, and the streets were so few; and the  people&mdash;why she could count them.</p>
  <p>Afterward,  she found that the exact number and the difference in color of the short line  of timbered houses stretching between them and the church were imprinted on her  brain; but she did not know it at the time for her attention was mainly fixed  upon the people when once she had seen them, for there was a strangeness in  their looks and actions she did not understand, all the more that it seemed to  have nothing to do either with Carleton or herself.</p>
  <p>It  was not fear they showed, not exactly, though consternation was not lacking in  their aspect, so strangely similar in all, whether they were men or women, or  whether they stood in groups in the street or came out singly on the doorstep  to glance about and listen, though there seemed to be nothing to listen to, for  the air was preternaturally still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton,  Carleton,&rdquo; she asked as he came to lift her to the ground, &ldquo;see those people  how oddly they act. The whole town is in the street. What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  except that if we do not hasten we shall have to return unmarried. The minister  is waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  in the church?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear. We are a little late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  took his arm, and though they were a fine couple and the event was almost an  unprecedented one in that remote village, only a few followed them; the rest  hung round their homes or gazed with indecision at the mountains or up and down  along the empty roads.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wilt  thou have this woman....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  ceremony had proceeded thus far and all seemed well, when with a rush and a cry  a dozen people burst into the building.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  snows are moving!&rdquo; rang up the aisles in accents of mad terror. &ldquo;Save  yourselves!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  came the silence of emptiness. Every soul had left the church save the three  before the pulpit.</p>
  <p>An  avalanche! and the ceremony was as yet incomplete! Ermentrude never forgot  Carleton Roberts&rsquo; look. Doubtless he never forgot hers. Meanwhile the minister  spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a chance for escape. Take it; the good God will pardon you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the bridegroom stood firm and the bride shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  till the words are said which make us man and wife,&rdquo; declared Carleton Roberts.  &ldquo;Unless&rdquo;&mdash;and here his perfect courtesy manifested itself even in this crisis of  life and death&mdash;&ldquo;you feel it your duty to carry what assistance you can to the  saving of your frightened flock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  must save my flock,&rdquo; said the minister with a solemn glance upward. &ldquo;I am where  my duty places me.&rdquo; And calmly as though the pews were filled with guests and  joy attended the ceremony instead of apprehended doom, he proceeded with the  rite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilt  thou have this man....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  glad &ldquo;I will&rdquo; leaped bravely from Ermentrude&rsquo;s lips; but it was lost in loud  calls and shrieks from without, mingled with that sound&mdash;terrible to all who  hear&mdash;impossible to describe&mdash;of the might of the hills made audible in this  down-rushing mass, now halting, now gathering fresh momentum, but coming&mdash;always  coming, till its voice, but now a threat, swells into thunder in which all human  cries are lost, and only from the movement of the minister&rsquo;s lips can this  couple see that the words which make them one are being spoken.</p>
  <p>Then  comes the benediction, and with the falling of those holy hands, a headlong  rush into the open air&mdash;a vision of flying forms here, there, and everywhere&mdash;men  staggering under foolish burdens&mdash;women on their knees with arms lifted to  heaven or flung around their babes&mdash;hope lost under the bowing mountain; and in  the midst of it all, plain to the view of all, the stranger&rsquo;s horse and  carriage which, standing there, stamped with undying honor these terrified  villagers, who had seen and not touched them though Death had them by the hair.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quick!  quick! You mother there with the child, get in, get in; there is room here for  one more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  another got the place. The driver, reeling as he ran, sprang for the empty seat  and hung there between the wheels as the horses plunged and tore away to safety  just as the great mass with its weight of gathered boulders and uprooted forests  crashed in final doom upon that devoted village, burying it from sight as  though it had never been.</p>
  <p>To  safety? Yes, for two of them; the other, struck by a flying stone, fell in the  road and was covered in a trice. So close were they to destruction&rsquo;s edge at  this moment of headlong flight.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>Not  till the painted towers encircling Lucerne had come again into sight did the  newly wedded pair find words or make the least attempt to speak. Then Carleton  kissed his bride and for a moment love was triumphant. Was it triumphant enough  to lead him to acknowledge their marriage? She looked anxiously in his face to  see and finally she asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  much of this are we to tell, Carleton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  about the catastrophe; but nothing more,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
  <p>And  while her heart retained its homage, the light in her eyes was veiled.</p>
  <p>Married  but not acknowledged! Would it not have been better if the avalanche had  overwhelmed them? She almost thought so, till bending, he murmured in her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall follow you soon. Did you think I could go on living without you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why  so thoughtful, Ermentrude? You are not quite yourself to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle  is very ill. The doctors say that he may not live a month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  does that grieve you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  yes was on her lips, but she did not utter it. Instead, she drew a little  ribbon from her breast, on which hung a plain gold ring, and gazing earnestly  at this token she remarked very quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton,  have you ever thought that but for this ring no proof remains in all this world  of our ever having been married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  our hearts know it. Is that not enough?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  to-day, yes. But when uncle goes....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  kisses finished the sentence for her, and love resumed its sway; but when alone  and wakeful on her pillow, she recalled his look, the sting of her first doubt  darted through her uneasy heart, and feeling eagerly after the ring she tore it  from its ribbon and put it on her finger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is my right,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Henceforth I shall wear it. He loves me too well  to quarrel with my decision. Now am I really his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>Did  she see a change in him? Did he come less frequently? Did he stay less long?  Was there uneasiness in his eye&mdash;coolness&mdash;languor? No, no. It was her exacting  heart which thus interpreted his look&mdash;which counted the days&mdash;forgot his many engagements&mdash;saw  impatience in the quickness with which he corrected her faults in manner or  language instead of the old indulgence which met each error with a smile. Love  cannot always keep at fever-heat. He, the cynosure of the whole foreign  element, had the world at his feet here as in Lucerne. It needed no jealous eye  to see this; while she&mdash;well, she had her attractions too, as had been often  proved, and with God&rsquo;s help she would yet be a fit mate for him. What she now  lacked, she would acquire. She would watch these fine ladies who blushed with  pleasure at his approach, and when her time of mourning was over she would  astonish him with her graces and her appearance. For she knew how to dress,  yes, with the best of them, and hold her head and walk like the queen she would  feel herself to be when once she bore his name. Patience then, till she had  stored her mind and learned the ways he was accustomed to in others. She had  money enough now that her uncle was dead, and she could do things....</p>
  <p>Yes,  but something had gone out of her face, and the ring hung loose on her finger.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>And  he? Had her fears read him aright? Had he grown indifferent or was he simply  perplexed? Let us watch him as he paces his hotel room one glorious afternoon,  now stopping to re-read a letter he held in his hand, and now to gaze out with  unseeing eyes to where the blue of the sea melts into the blue of the sky on  the far horizon.</p>
  <p>Love  had been sweet; but man has other passions, and he is in the grip of the one  mightiest in men of his stamp&mdash;the all-engrossing, all-demanding one of personal  ambition.</p>
  <p>Without  solicitation, without expectation even, a hand had been held out to him whose  least grasp meant success in the one field most to his mind,&mdash;a political career  under auspices which had never been known to fail. But there were conditions  attached&mdash;conditions which a year before would have filled him with joy, but  which now stood like a barrier between him and his goal, unless.... But he was  not yet ready to disavow his wife, trample upon her heart, nay on his own as  well;&mdash;that is, without a struggle.</p>
  <p>For  the third time he read the letter which you will see was from his mother.</p>
  <p>My  Son:&mdash;I have an apology to make and a bit of news to give you. When I urged you  to give up Lucie and to seek distraction abroad, I felt that I was doing  justice to your immaturity and saving you from ties which might very easily  jeopardize your future happiness.</p>
  <p>But  I have lately changed my mind. In seeing more of her I have not only learned  her worth but the advantage such a woman would be to one of your tastes and  promise. And she loves you more devotedly, perhaps, than you have loved her.  How do I know this? Let me tell you of an interview I had with a certain  relative of hers last night. I allude to her brother, and for a recognized boss  buried out of sight in politics, he has more heart in his breast than I have  ever given him credit for. Not having children of his own, he has centered his  affections on this choice little sister of his, and finding her far from happy,  came to see me yesterday evening with this proposition: If I would consent to  your union with Lucie, and withdraw my opposition to your immediate marriage,  he would take your future in charge and put you in the way of political  advancement only to be limited, as he says, by your talents, which he is good  enough to rate very high.</p>
  <p>After  this, how can I do otherwise than bid you follow your impulses and marry Lucie  in spite of the disparity of years to which I have hitherto taken exception.  Were she as poor as she is accounted rich, I should say the same, now that I  have sounded the depths of her lovely disposition and the rare culture of a  mind which those seven years have enriched beyond what is usual even in women  of intellect. Her money does not influence me in her favor, nor does it weigh  with me in my present opinion of her complete fitness for the position you are  so eager to give her. That this will make you happy I know. Let it hasten your  return which cannot be too speedy.</p>
  <p>This  was the bombshell which had disturbed Carleton Roberts&rsquo; complacency, bared his  own soul to his horrified view, and revealed to him the weakness of his moral  nature which he had hitherto considered strong. For his first impulse was one  of recoil, not only from the secret marriage which shut him off from these new  hopes, but from his youthful bride as well. He found himself weary of his  flowery bonds and eager for a man&rsquo;s life in his native city. Oh, why had he  urged this immature girl to take the ride which had led him into slavery to one  who could not advance him in life, however queen-like she moved and talked and  smiled upon the world from the heights of her physical perfections. It was  brain that was needed&mdash;an understanding like Lucie&rsquo;s, tempered, like hers, by  years, not months, of culture and refined association.</p>
  <p>It  was at this point he paused in his restless walk and looked for inspiration to  the far-off waters of the bluest of all seas.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he resumed his walk; then quickly stopping again sat down at his desk and with  an air of desperate haste began a letter to his mother with the announcement:</p>
  <p>It  is too late. Unfortunately for your scheme, I am already....</p>
  <p>He  never got any further. A fresh impulse drove him into the street. He could not  thus summarily settle his future fate. It meant too much to him. He must take  time to think. His heart clamors loudly for its rights; he is only  twenty-six&mdash;and in a rush of feeling which should have been his salvation, he  turned toward that nest among the flowers where help was to be had if help was  to come at all in this crisis of conflicting passions.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>The  hour was noon, one which he had never chosen before for a visit to Ermentrude.  Would he find her in? Would she be in spirits to meet him? Would she look  beautiful&mdash;worthy of his name, worthy of the greatest sacrifice a man can make  for a woman? He half hoped that she would; that he would find his chains  riveted and secure beyond the power of any force to break.</p>
  <p>As  his musings faltered, he turned the knob of the little side door and went in.  As he did so a shower of rose-leaves fell upon him from the vines enveloping  the balcony.</p>
  <p>He  shuddered slightly and passed down the hall. Everything was very still.</p>
  <p>She  was asleep. Lying on a couch in utter weariness or pain, she had drifted off  into the land of dreams, and he felt that he had a moment of respite. He could  look and weigh the question: Love or a quick success? A weakling&rsquo;s paradise or  the goal of the strong man?</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  she was not as beautiful as he thought. But she was more touching&mdash;less robust,  less bounteous of aspect, more child-like, more appealing,&mdash;a woman who, if he  were no more of a man than he appeared to be in this hurly-burly of pleasure  and fashion, might in time do him credit and hold him back from follies.</p>
  <p>But  he was not just the man these casual friends and admirers considered him. There  was much more to him than that. He knew this better than Lucie did or her  powerful brother, or even his adoring mother. Great opportunities awaited him  and a large space in the affairs of men if not of nations. Such confidence did  he feel in himself at this fevered moment that he never doubted that eventually  he would gain all this, even with the handicap of a good-looking but  unsophisticated wife.</p>
  <p>But  not quickly;... step by step perhaps ... and he was longing to take it all at a  bound.</p>
  <p>Poor  girl! and she lay there under his eyes all unmindful of his conflict or of the  fact that her fate as well as his was trembling in the balance; unmindful,  though her dreams were far from joyous&mdash;or why the tear welling from between her  lashes as he gazed.</p>
  <p>She  was alone in the house; he knew it by the complete silence. He could look and  look and study her every feature, without fear of interruption; wait for her  waking and be ready to meet her first glance of tender astonishment which might  restore him to his better self.</p>
  <p>Drawing  up a chair, he sat down; then started upright again with dilating eyes and a  strange shadow on his brow. One of her arms lay uppermost and on the  hand&mdash;almost as fine as Lucie&rsquo;s, but not quite,&mdash;he saw the ring&mdash;his ring, and it  hung loosely. The poor child was growing thin, very thin. &ldquo;If she were to hold  her hand downward,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, &ldquo;I believe that ring would fall  off.&rdquo; Did some stray glimpse of his own features, wearing a look never seen on  them before, confront him from some near-by mirror that he started so guiltily  as this heart murmur rose to his lips? Or was it at a thought, hideous but  tempting, which held him, gained upon him and soon absolutely possessed him,  till his own hand went out stealthily and with hesitations toward those  helpless fingers of hers, now approaching, now withdrawing, and now approaching  them again but not touching them, great as his impulse was to do so, for fear  she should wake, while yet the devil gripped his arm and lit up baleful fires  in his eyes.</p>
  <p>He  had remembered those words of hers: &ldquo;Have you ever thought that with the  exception of this ring no proof exists in all the world of our ever having been  married?&rdquo; Remember them? He had not remembered them; he had heard them,  sounding and resounding in his ears till the whole room seemed to palpitate  with them. Then the devil made his final move. Ermentrude shuddered, and her  position changing, the hand which had been uppermost fell down at her side and  the ring slipped&mdash;left her finger&mdash;paused on the edge of the couch&mdash;then came to  rest in his palm held out to receive it.</p>
  <p>He  had not drawn it from her hand. Fate had restored it. As he forced himself to  look at it lying in his grasp, a faintness as of death seized and held him for  a moment; then this passed and he slowly rose and step by step with sidelong  looks and hair starting upright on his forehead, like one who has walked in  blood and sees the trail of guilt following him along the floor, he left her  side&mdash;he left the room&mdash;he left the house&mdash;and the rose-leaves fell about him once  more, maddening him with their color, maddening him with the memories  inseparable from their sweetness&mdash;a sweetness which spoke of her, of love, and  the attachment of a true heart destined to grieve for a little while at least,  for he was never going back, never, never.</p>
  <p>There  was no eye to see, and no tongue to tell him that the seed, destined to flower  into awful crime some dozen or more years later, put forth its first bud at  this fatal hour.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>He  wrote her a letter. He had the grace to do that. Addressing her simply as  Ermentrude, he told her that he had been called home to enter upon the serious  business of life. That he was not likely to come back, and as she was not  really his wife, however pleasing the fiction had been in which they had both  indulged, it seemed to him wiser to end their happy romance thus suddenly and  while much of its glamour remained, than to linger on and see it decay day by  day before their eyes till nothing but bitterness remained. He loved her and  felt the wrench more than she did, but duty and his obligations as a man, etc.,  etc., till it ended in his signature limited to initials like his love.</p>
  <p>Despicable!  the work of a man without conscience or heart! Yes, and he knew it, and for  weeks his sleep was broken by visions and his waking hours rendered dreadful by  fears. How had she taken this cool assumption that the ceremony performed in  the path of the snow was voided by lack of proof? To whom had she ascribed the  loss of her ring, and what must she think of him? He had left Nice almost  immediately, but wherever he went, in whatever hotel he stayed, or through  whatever street he passed, he was always expecting to see her figure rise up  before him in the majesty of innocence and outraged love.</p>
  <p>Thus  several weeks passed, and seeing nothing of her, hearing nothing from her, a  different apprehension darkened his days and despoiled him of rest at night.  Grief if not shame had killed her; and the weight of her fancied doom lay heavy  on his heart. At last he could bear it no longer, and stealing back to Nice he  entered it one dark night and prepared to learn for himself what he feared to  trust to the discretion of another. Alone, with hidden face and heavily  throbbing heart, he trod the familiar ways and encircled the familiar walls.  Had she been there&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  the windows were blank and the place desolate, and he fled the spot and the  town, with his questions unasked and his fears unallayed. In two days he had  sailed for home. With the ocean between them he might forget; and in time he  did. As week followed week, and the silence he had half trusted, half feared,  remained unbroken, his equanimity gradually returned, and he prepared to face  the prospect of his new marriage much as a man who watches for a dreaded door  to open moves with restored confidence about his affairs, when at last  convinced that the door is padlocked and the key lost.</p>
  <p>One  precaution and one only he was wise enough to take. He told his story to Lucie&rsquo;s  brother, and left it to him to say whether or not he should marry his sister.  And the answer was yes; that if trouble came he would see him through it. A  marriage which could not be proved was no marriage, and as for anything else,  Lucie&rsquo;s happiness must not be sacrificed to a boy&rsquo;s peccadillos. What were a  few wild oats sown by a man of his promise?</p>
  <p>And  was this the end? Did Ermentrude accept her doom without a struggle?</p>
  <p>Let  us see.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>One  afternoon in June, there entered the parlor of the old-fashioned mansion of the  Roberts family a lady who had asked to see Mrs. Roberts on business of an  important nature. Though plainly clad, her appearance possessed an elegance  which insured respect; but when alone and seated in the darkest corner of the great  drawing room she put up a trembling hand to thrust back her veil, the  countenance thus revealed betrayed an emotion hardly in keeping with the quiet  bearing with which she had advanced under the servant&rsquo;s eye.</p>
  <p>His  home! and these the surroundings amid which he had grown to manhood! Why should  the sight of all this rouse emotions she believed eliminated by a treachery  most cruel in face of promises most sacred? Why, as she looked about, and noted  object after object which must have been there previous to his birth, did she  see him as a child and boy and not as the man who had first won and then  deserted her? She would not have had it so at this hour when strength was  needed rather than tenderness. But she could not help her nature, or still the  wild surging of her rebellious heart, as his portrait seen upon the wall  challenged her constancy and whispered of the hour when his &ldquo;forever&rdquo; echoed  her &ldquo;forever&rdquo; and the compact for eternity was sealed.</p>
  <p>He  had broken this compact&mdash;broken it soon&mdash;broken it before the honeymoon had  passed. But she! Was she to show no firmer spirit whose love was of the soul  and took no note of time? She was his wife, and acknowledged or unacknowledged,  must yet prove to be his blessing though he&mdash;he&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  this would not do. The interview before her called for calmness. She would not  add to the turbulence of her spirits by another glance at what brought back too  much of the past to fortify her for the impending struggle. She had to do  credit to his choice, to impress a difficult woman with her dignity as a wife.  She must not shake nor weep.</p>
  <p>Yet  when she heard a step at the door, instinct told her to pull down her veil till  the first greetings were over&mdash;a precaution for which she was deeply grateful  when in another moment a young woman entered instead of her husband&rsquo;s mother  for whom she had asked and whom she naturally expected to see.</p>
  <p>In  the humiliation of the moment, her disappointment took words and she muttered  within herself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  companion or possibly a relative. I am to be put off with kindly excuses;  begged to state my errand&mdash;rehearse my claims and my hopes to some gentle  go-between! I have not strength for that. I must see the mother&mdash;the mother. God  give me wisdom and keep me calm&mdash;calm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the young woman she had instinctively called gentle advanced into the center of  the room. Mechanically, Ermentrude rose to meet her, and thus stepped into a  better light. Tragedy came with her. This it was impossible not to see&mdash;not to  feel. But the warning which her aspect gave passed as she spoke and said in  tones a little tremulous, perhaps, but with an air of perfect courtesy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had hoped to see Mrs. Roberts herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  smile with which this was greeted, the flush of pride and the joy of possession  which lit the other&rsquo;s pleasing features as she replied, &ldquo;I am Mrs. Roberts,&rdquo;  should have carried the truth to Ermentrude.</p>
  <p>But  they did not. She looked surprised&mdash;baffled, and after the briefest hesitation,  observed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a stranger in this city and have doubtless made some mistake. The Mrs. Roberts  I have called to see&mdash;and I was told she lived here&mdash;is the mother of a gentleman  of the name of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  could not speak it.</p>
  <p>But  the other could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carleton?&rdquo;  she asked; and at Ermentrude&rsquo;s agitated nod, added with friendly interest: &ldquo;This  is her home; but she has left it for a while to us. I am Mr. Carleton Roberts&rsquo;  wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>There  are blows which prostrate; there are others which sear but leave the body  intact&mdash;feet still supporting it&mdash;eyes still gazing ahead unmoved&mdash;lips moving  with mechanical exactness and sometimes still retaining their smile. Only the  soul which gave life to all of this is dead. The image is there but the spirit  is gone; and if sufficiently preoccupied, the one who struck the blow sees no  change. So was it with Ermentrude and Lucie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are looking for mother to return next week,&rdquo; added the latter as Ermentrude  stood stark and silent before her. &ldquo;Would you like to leave a message for her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  these words uttered with the sweetness of a rich and sympathetic nature, the  soul returned to Ermentrude&rsquo;s body. With a long and earnest look which took in  the full measure of the other&rsquo;s personality, radiant with happiness and the  consciousness of an assured wifedom, she answered softly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I will leave no message,&rdquo; and turned as if to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  any name?&rdquo; queried Lucie, eying with admiration the noble lines of a figure  with whose perfect proportions her own could never hope to compete.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  any name,&rdquo; came back in indescribable accents from the doorway.</p>
  <p>Lucie  paused, and gazing in vague trouble after her rapidly disappearing visitor,  murmured to herself, &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the one who could have answered her was gone.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Carleton,  you seldom see such a woman. Younger than I, she had the poise of a woman of  thirty. Who could she have been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Describe  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could; I hardly saw her face; it was her figure, her voice, her way of  moving and holding herself. I felt as small and quiet as a little mouse beside  her. Only I was happy and she was not. That much I feel now that I recall her  look in leaving.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  she American or&mdash;or foreign?&rdquo; he asked, hiding his trouble, for a great fear had  seized him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  had an English accent which added very much to her charm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forget  her.&rdquo; For a moment his accent was almost fierce, then he laughed the matter  off, assuring this bride of a month that she made him cross with her  self-depreciation, that there was no one of finer mien and manner than herself,  the chosen of his heart upon whom he always looked with pride. Which subtle  tribute to what was her greatest charm accomplished its end; she did forget the  stranger.</p>
  <p>But  he did not; he knew what was before him and prepared himself for the inevitable  meeting which would be followed by&mdash;what?</p>
  <p>Not  by what he had every right to expect and evidently did. Ermentrude had learned  all she would both of this marriage and of the woman who had supplanted her,  and had made her resolve. This he saw as they came together in the isolation of  a quiet corner of the Park, and so was not greatly surprised, though a little  moved, as after the first few words, and with an earnest look, she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am your wife, I, Ermentrude Roberts, married to you in the sight of God and  man. I cannot prove it, but as you once said, our hearts know it and will  continue to know it as long as either of us lives. But I am not going to  obtrude my claims upon you, Carleton, or stand like a specter in your path. Had  this woman you have deceived been weak or foolish or unloving, or indeed  anything but what she is, I might have held to my rights and insisted upon a  recognition which would have profited you in the end. But I cannot shame that  woman&mdash;I can neither shame her nor bring her to grief. You have broken one  heart, but you shall be saved the remorse of breaking two. I had rather suffer  myself. I am alone in the world. I have means. I can ultimately be useful and  face good men and women without fear. Why then should I drag down to the dust  one as innocent as myself, or take from you what may make you the man I once  thought you and hope to see you again. But that I may have strength for this  and for all the sacrifices it involves, you must declare here, now, in this  open park where we stand, with no one within sight much less within hearing,  that I am your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is enough. Now I can say what otherwise could never have left my lips. I love  you, Carleton, love you to eternity as I promised; but I shall never seek you  again, and you can go on your way unperturbed. I have consolations here,&rdquo;  laying her hand on her breast. &ldquo;It will no longer be my portion to watch your  face for signs of a failing regard. What I have is mine, and that is the  undying memory of two months of perfect happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  would have said more, but she saw that he had been greatly shaken. She feared  the renewal of a flame not yet altogether extinct in a heart which once beat  for her alone, and so contenting herself with a low farewell, she was turning  swiftly away, when one last thought made her pause and say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot return you your ring. It is lost. I was careless with it and it fell  unnoticed from my hand. But to-night I will send you back the little clock  which unites our initials. Destroy it if you will, but if some sentiment bids  you keep it, let it be this one and no other: &lsquo;I recall Ermentrude only that I  may be faithful to Lucie.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>With  a low cry his head fell upon his breast in extreme self-abasement, then he  slowly lifted his eyes and seeing in her face a full knowledge of his sin,  murmured in overwhelming shame and contrition:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know me for the wretch I am. I have the ring; it fell from your hand into mine  one day while you lay asleep. I do not ask for forgiveness, but this I promise  you, Ermentrude:&mdash;if the little clock comes back, I will make a place in it for  this ring, and neither clock nor ring shall leave me again while I live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively  her hands went out to him, then they fell back on her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  will hold you to that promise,&rdquo; she said; and melted away from his sight in the  mist which had been gradually enveloping them without being seen by either.</p>
  <p>Thus  the struggle ended for him, which for her had simply begun.</p>
  <p>Not  till she found herself in the South with her girl friend, Antoinette Duclos,  did she discover that the closest bond which can unite man and woman held her  in spite of her late compact with Carleton Roberts. Should she reassert her  rights and demand that the father should recognize his child? Her generous  heart said No. The old arguments held good. She appealed to Antoinette for  advice.</p>
  <p>The  result we know. When Antoinette&rsquo;s own child died at birth, she took Ermentrude&rsquo;s  to her heart and brought it up as her own. There was little difficulty in this,  as the Professor had already yielded to a Southern fever and lay at rest in a  New Orleans cemetery.</p>
  <p>And  this brings us to another episode.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>The  widow in fact and the widow in heart stood face to face above a sleeping  infant. They were both dressed for traveling and so was the babe. The  dismantled rooms showed why. Young still, for the years of either&rsquo;s romance had  been few, each face, as the other contemplated it, told the story of sorrow  which Time, for all its kindliness, would never efface. But the charm of either  remained&mdash;perceptible at this hour as perhaps it would never be again to the  same extent. Antoinette basked in the light of Ermentrude&rsquo;s beauty ennobled by  renunciation, and Ermentrude in that wonderful look in her friend&rsquo;s plain face  which came at great crises and made her for the moment the equal of the best.</p>
  <p>They  had said little; and they said little now, as is the way of the strong amongst  us when an act is to be performed which wrings the heart but satisfies the  conscience.</p>
  <p>The  child was legitimate. It must not grow up under a shadow. To insure its welfare  and raise no doubt in its own mind as it grew in knowledge and feeling, the two  women must separate. No paltering with this duty, and no delay. A month of baby  cries and baby touches might weaken the real mother. It should be now. It  should be to-day.</p>
  <p>But  first, a final word&mdash;a parting question. It was uttered by Ermentrude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will go back to France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I can easily live there. And you, Ermentrude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  New York. I shall never go far from him. But he and I will never meet. My world  will not be his world. I shall make my own place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  Ermentrude Taylor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  Mrs. Ermentrude Taylor. I am a wife. I shall never forget that fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the child? Will you never come to see it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ermentrude&rsquo;s  head fell and she stood a long time without answering. Then with a steady look  she calmly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can think of but one contingency which might shake my resolution to leave her  yours without the least interruption from me. If <i>he</i>&mdash;Antoinette, if he  were left alone and childless, I might see my duty differently from now. You  must be prepared for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ermentrude,  when you send me this little shoe&mdash;See, I will leave one on and give you the  other, I shall know that you are coming, or that you want the child. My life is  yours as I once promised, and do you think I would hold back the child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  again their hands met as once before, in that strong clasp, which means:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trust  me to the death and beyond it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>With  Antoinette it was to the death, as we have seen. Warned by Ermentrude of the  appalling results of their plan to bring father and child together, and  entreated to fly lest her story should imperil the secret upon the preservation  of which his very life now hung, she answered to the call as she had promised,  and thus acquitted her debt though she failed to save him.</p>
  <p>Of  her previous act in disfiguring his photograph in her temporary lodging-place,  we shall never know the full story. The picture had been hers for years, given  her by Ermentrude on their parting, so that the child should not be without  some semblance of her father even if she should not know him as such, and it  was to secure this clue to their now doubly dangerous secret that Madame Duclos  ransacked her baggage previous to her flight from the New York hotel. But  whether its destruction in the peculiar manner we know was the result of simple  precaution, or of a feeling of antagonism so strong against this destroyer of  her beloved&rsquo;s peace, that it had to be expended in some way before she felt  strong enough for that supreme sacrifice in his favor toward which events  seemed hurrying her, may be known in <i>Eternity</i> but will never be told in <i>Time</i>.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>And  Ermentrude? What of her? Alone, robbed of husband and child and friend&mdash;where  shall we look for her in this world of extreme tribulation? Search the  hospitals of France where they press closest to the trenches. There will you  find the woman who losing all has found much. Blessing and blest! the angel of  the battlefield whom the bullets spare since her work on earth is not yet  accomplished!</p>

  <h2>THE END</h2>
