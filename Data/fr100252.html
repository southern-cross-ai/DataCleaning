    The &ldquo;Starlight&rdquo;</b></h3>
  <p>As the rising sun had just begun to pierce the misty tropic haze of early
    dawn, a small, white-painted schooner of ninety or a hundred tons burden
    was bearing down upon the low, densely-wooded island of Mayou, which lies
    between the coast of south-east New Guinea and the murderous Solomon Group&mdash;the
    grave of the white man in Melanesia.</p>
  <p>The white population of Mayou was not large, for it consisted only of an
    English missionary and his wife&mdash;who was, of course, a white woman&mdash;a
    German trader named Peter Schwartzkoff and his native wife; an English trader
    named Charlie Blount, with his two half-caste sons and daughters; and an
    American trader and ex-whaler, named Nathaniel Burrowes, with his wives.</p>
  <p>Although the island is of large extent, and of amazing fertility, the native
    population was at this time comparatively small, numbering only some three
    thousand souls. They nearly all lived at the south-west end of the island,
    the rendezvous of the few trading ships that visited the place. Occasionally
    a surveying vessel, and, at longer intervals still, a labour-recruiting ship
    from Hawaii or Fiji, would call. At such times the monotony of the lives
    of the white residents of Mayou was pleasantly broken. Once a year, too,
    a missionary vessel would drop anchor in the little reef-bound port, but
    her visit was of moment only to the Rev. Mr. Deighton, his wife, and their
    native converts, and the mission ship&rsquo;s presence in the harbour was
    taken no notice of by the three white traders; for a missionary ship is not
    always regarded by the average trader in the South Seas as a welcome visitor.</p>
  <p>Almost with the rising of the sun the vessel had been sighted from the shore
    by a party of natives, who were fishing off the south end of the island,
    and in a few minutes their loud cries reached other natives on shore, and
    by them was passed on from house to house along the beach till it reached
    the town itself. From there, presently, came a deep sonorous shout, &ldquo;<i>Evaka!
    Evaka!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;A ship! A ship!&rdquo;), and then they swarmed
    out of their thatched dwellings like bees from a hive and ran, laughing and
    shouting together, down to the beach in front of the village.</p>
  <p>As the clamour increased, the Rev. Wilfrid Deighton opened the door of his
    study and stepped out upon the shady verandah of the mission house, which
    stood upon a gentle, palm-covered rise about five hundred yards from the
    thickly clustering houses of the native village. He was a tall, thin man
    with a scanty brown beard, and his face wore a wearied, anxious expression.
    His long, lean body, coarse, toil-worn hands, and shabby clothing indicated,
    too, that the lines of the Rev. Wilfrid had not been cast in a pleasant place
    when he chose the wild, unhealthy island of Mayou as the field of his labours.
    But if he showed bodily traces of the hard, continuous toil he had undergone
    during the seven years&rsquo; residence among the people of Mayou, his eye
    was still full of the fire of that noble missionary spirit which animated
    the souls of such earnest men as Moffat and Livingstone, and Williams of
    Erromanga, and Gordon of Khartoum. For he was an enthusiast, who believed
    in his work; and so did his wife, a pretty, faded little woman of thirty,
    with a great yearning to save souls, though at times she longed to return
    to the comforts and good dinners of semi-civilisation in other island groups
    nearer the outside world she had been away from so long.</p>
  <p>The missionary stepped out on the verandah, and shaded his eyes from the
    glare with his rough, sun-tanned hands, as he looked seaward at the advancing
    vessel. Soon his wife followed him and placed her hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Wilfrid? Surely not the <i>John Hunt</i>. She is not
    due for months yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not her, certainly, Alice,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and not a trading
    vessel either, I should think. She looks more like a yacht Perhaps she may
    be a new man-of-war schooner. However, we will soon see. Put on your hat,
    my dear, and let us go down to the beach. Already Blount, Schwartzkoff, and
    Burrowes have gone; and it certainly would not do for me to remain in the
    background when the newcomers land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Deighton, her pale face flushing with gentle excitement at the prospect
    of meeting Europeans, quickly retired to her room, and making a rapid toilette,
    rejoined her husband, who, white umbrella in hand, awaited her at the gate.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the reverend gentleman, a few
    minutes later, as, accompanied by Mrs. Deighton, he joined the three white
    traders, &ldquo;what vessel is it? Have you any idea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; answered Blount, with a short nod to Mr. Deighton,
    but lifting his leaf hat to his wife, &ldquo;we were just wondering ourselves.
    Doesn&rsquo;t look like a trader&mdash;more like a gunboat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime the schooner had worked her way in through the passage, and, surrounded
    by a fleet of canoes, soon brought up and anchored. Her sails were very quickly
    handled, then almost as soon as she swung to her anchor a smart, white-painted
    boat was lowered, and the people on shore saw the crew haul her up to the
    gangway ladder.</p>
  <p>Presently a white man, who, by his dress, was an officer of the ship, followed
    by another person in a light tweed suit and straw hat, entered the boat,
    which then pushed off and was headed for the shore. As she approached nearer,
    the traders and the missionary could see that the crew were light-skinned
    Polynesians, dressed in blue cotton jumpers, white duck pants, and straw
    hats. The officer&mdash;who steered with a steer-oar&mdash;wore a brass-bound
    cap and brass-buttoned jacket, and every now and then turned to speak to
    the man in the tweed suit, who sat smoking a cigar beside him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By jingo! she&rsquo;s a yacht, I believe,&rdquo; said Charlie Blount,
    who had been keenly watching the approaching boat; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off.
    I don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with people of that sort&mdash;glorified
    London drapers, who ask &lsquo;Have you&mdash;ah&mdash;got good shooting
    heah?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then turning on his heel, he raised his hat to Mrs. Deighton, nodded to
    the other white men, and sauntered along the beach to his house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess Blount&rsquo;s kinder set again meetin&rsquo; people like
    these,&rdquo; said Burrowes, nodding in the direction of the boat and addressing
    himself to Mr. and Mrs. Deighton. &ldquo;Reckon they might be some all-powerful
    British swells he knew when he was one himself. Guess they won&rsquo;t scare <i>me</i> a
    cent&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Id was brober dadt he should veel so,&rdquo; remarked the German; &ldquo;if
    some Yerman shentle-mans vas to come here und zee me dresd like vom dirty
    sailor mans, den I too vould get me home to mein house und say nodings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said Mr. Deighton, speaking reproachfully, yet
    secretly pleased at Blount&rsquo;s departure, &ldquo;no man need feel ashamed
    at meeting his countrymen on account of the poverty of his attire; I am sure
    that the sight of an English gentleman is a very welcome one to me and Mrs.
    Deighton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Burrowes with easy but not offensive familiarity, &ldquo;I
    guess, parson, thet you and Mrs. Deighton hed better form yourselves inter
    a committee of welcome, and tell them so; I ain&rsquo;t much in the polite
    speechifying line myself, neither is &lsquo;Schneider&rsquo; here,&rdquo; nodding
    at the German, &ldquo;and you can sling in somethin&rsquo; ornymental &rsquo;bout
    me bein&rsquo; the representative of the United States&mdash;a gentleman
    a-recrootin&rsquo; of his health in the South Sea Islands doorin&rsquo; a
    perlitercal crisis in Washington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By this time the boat had run her bows up on to the white, sandy beach,
    and the straw-hatted, tweed-suited gentleman jumped lightly out. Taking off
    his hat with a graceful, circular sweep, which included every one on the
    beach, white and native, he said with languid politeness&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day, gentlemen; I scarcely hoped to have the pleasure of meeting
    Europeans at this place&mdash;and certainly never imagined that pleasure
    would be enhanced by the presence of a lady,&rdquo; he added as he caught
    sight of Mrs. Deighton standing apart some little distance from the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am pleased to meet you, sir,&rdquo; said the missionary, constituting
    himself spokesman for the others; &ldquo;you are welcome, sir, very welcome
    to Mayou, and to anything that it lies in our power to furnish you with for
    your&mdash;schooner, or should I say yacht, for such, by her handsome appearance,
    I presume she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The visitor, who was a handsome, fair-haired man, with a blonde moustache
    and blue eyes, bowed his thanks, and then said,  &ldquo;May I have the honour
    to introduce myself. My name is De Vere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I am the Rev. Wilfrid Deighton, missionary in charge of this
    island. My two&mdash;&rdquo; (here he hesitated a moment before the next
    word) &ldquo;friends are Mr. Peter Schwartzkoff and Mr. Nathaniel Burrowes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delighted to meet you,&rdquo; said Mr. de Vere, bowing politely to
    the lady, but extending a white, shapely hand to the men;  &ldquo;and now
    I must tell you that I shall be very glad to avail myself, Mr. Deighton,
    of your kind offer. We are in want of water, and anything in the way of vegetables,
    etcetera, that we can get. We intend, however, to stay here a few days and
    refit. Having been in very bad weather coming through the southern part of
    the Solomon Group we must effect repairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might I inquire, mister,&rdquo; asked Burrowes, &ldquo;ef your vessel
    is a trader, or jest a pleasure schooner, as the parson here says?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Deighton is quite correct,&rdquo; said Mr. de Vere, with another
    graceful bow; &ldquo;the <i>Starlight</i> is a yacht. I can quite understand
    your not being able to make her out. She was originally built for the navy
    as a gunboat, but was sold in Sydney, after some years&rsquo; service. I
    bought her and had her altered into a yacht to cruise about these delightful
    and beautiful South Sea Islands. My friend, the Honourable John Morcombe-Lycett,
    accompanies me. Our English yachting experience had much to do with our determination
    to make a cruise down here. In fact,&rdquo; and here Mr. de Vere showed his
    white, even teeth in a smile, and stroked his drooping blonde moustache,  &ldquo;we
    left London with the intention of chartering a vessel in Sydney for a cruise
    among the islands. Mr. Morcombe-Lycett is, however, very unwell to-day, and
    so has not landed, but here am I; and I am very happy indeed to make your
    acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, turning towards the boat, he called out to the officer who had brought
    him, &ldquo;Come ashore for me at dinner-time, Captain Sykes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2<br>
    A Difference Of Opinion</b></h3>
  <p>A few hours later Mr. de Vere was on very friendly terms with Mr. and Mrs.
    Deighton, who had carried him off to the mission house, after the boat returned
    to the schooner. Before he accompanied them, however, he told Messrs. Burrowes
    and Schwartzkoff, as he shook hands, that he would not fail to visit them
    later on in the day at their respective houses. And both Peter, and the American,
    who on any other occasion would have been justly indignant at any white visitor
    not a missionary himself foregoing, even for a short time, the pleasure of
    their society for that of a &ldquo;blarsted missionary,&rdquo; shook hands
    with him most vigorously, and said they would be proud to see him. Then they
    hurried off homewards.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s house and trading station lay midway between that of Charlie
    Blount and the American&rsquo;s, but instead of making for his own place,
    Peter, to the surprise of Blount, who was now standing at his door watching
    them, went inside Burrowes&rsquo; house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s d&mdash;d curious, now,&rdquo; said Blount, in English,
    to one of his half-caste daughters, a girl of eighteen; &ldquo;those two
    fellows hate each other like poison. I&rsquo;ve never known the Dutchman
    go into the Yankee&rsquo;s house, or the Yankee go into his, for the past
    two years, and here they are now as thick as thieves! I wonder what infernal
    roguery they are up to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Charlie Blount&rsquo;s amazement was perfectly natural, The German and American
    did dislike each other most intensely. Neither of them had lived so long
    on Mayou as Blount, but each was trying hard to work the other man off the
    island by accusing him to the natives of cheating them. As a matter of fact
    they were both scoundrels, but Banderah, the chief of Mayou, who was fond
    of white men, managed to keep a hollow peace between them. <i>He</i> was
    perfectly well aware that both of them cheated himself and his people, but
    as long as their cheating was practised moderately he did not mind. In Blount,
    however, he had the fullest confidence, and this good feeling was shared
    with him by every native on the island.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>Perhaps, had Blount been a witness of what occurred when the boat landed,
    his suspicion of his fellow-traders&rsquo; honesty would have been considerably
    augmented. For while the missionary and Mr. de Vere were bandying compliments,
    the German and American were exchanging signs with the officer who was in
    charge of the boat, and whom De Vere addressed as  &ldquo;Captain Sykes.&rdquo; The
    American, indeed, had started down the beach to speak to him, when Mr. de
    Vere called out to him to return to the ship, and Captain Sykes, with a gesture
    signifying that he would see Burrowes later on, swung round the boat&rsquo;s
    head and gave the word to his Kanaka crew to give way. As if quite satisfied
    with this dumb promise, the American returned to the group he had just left,
    and then the moment the missionary, Mrs. Deighton, and De Vere had gone,
    he and the German started off together.</p>
  <p>The moment they entered the American&rsquo;s house, Burrowes sat down on
    the table and the German on a gin case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Dutchy,&rdquo; said Burrowes, looking keenly at his companion, &ldquo;I
    reckon you know who the almighty swell in the brass-bound suit is, hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yaw,&rdquo; replied Schwartzkoff, &ldquo;it is Bilker, und I thought
    he was in brison for ten years mit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wal, that&rsquo;s true enough that he did get ten years. But that&rsquo;s
    six years ago, an&rsquo; I reckon they&rsquo;ve let him out. Public feelin&rsquo; in
    Australia agin nigger catchin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t very strong; an&rsquo; I
    reckon he&rsquo;s got out after doin&rsquo; five or six years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dot is so,&rdquo; asserted the German; and then he leaned forward, &ldquo;but
    vat vas he doing here in dis fine, swell schooner mit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest what you and me is goin&rsquo; to find out, Dutchy.
    An&rsquo; I guess that you an&rsquo; me <i>can</i> find out darned easy.
    Bilker ain&rsquo;t going to fool <i>me</i>; if he&rsquo;s on to anything
    good, I guess I&rsquo;m going to have a cut in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil, ve see by und by, ven he comes ashore. Von ding, I dells you,
    mine friend. Dot fine shentleman don&rsquo;t know vat you und me knows about
    Captain Bilker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The American gave an affirmative wink, and then going to a rude cupboard
    he took out a bottle of gin and a couple of tin mugs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look hyar, Peter, I guess you and me&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to do some
    business together over this schooner, so let&rsquo;s make friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vas agreeable,&rdquo; said the German with alacrity, rising from
    his seat and accepting the peace-offering. He nodded to Burrowes and tossed
    it off.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>By lunch-time Mr. Morcombe-Lycett had been brought ashore and had accepted
    Mr. Deighton&rsquo;s invitation to remain for the night He was a well-dressed,
    good-looking man of about thirty-five, and was, so Mr. Deighton sympathisingly
    announced to his wife, suffering from a touch of malarial fever, which a
    little quinine and nursing would soon put right Mr. Deighton himself, by
    the way, was suffering from the same complaint.</p>
  <p>At noon, as Charlie Blount was walking past Burrowes&rsquo; house, he was
    surprised to see that the German was still there. He was about to pass on&mdash;for
    although on fairly friendly terms with the two men, he did not care for either
    of them sufficiently well to enter their houses often, although they did
    his&mdash;when the American came to the door and asked him to come in and
    take a nip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to board the schooner?&rdquo; asked Burrowes, as Blount
    came in and sat down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going down to Lak-a-lak. I&rsquo;ve got some natives
    cutting timber for me there, and thought I would just walk along the beach
    and see how they are getting on. Besides that, my little girl Nellie is there
    with her uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Burrowes, with genuine surprise,  &ldquo;won&rsquo;t
    you go aboard and see if they have any provisions to sell? I heard you say
    the other day that you had quite run out of tinned meats and nearly out of
    coffee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I have; but I don&rsquo;t care about going on board for all that&rdquo; Then
    looking the two men straight in the face, he drank off the gin, set the mug
    down on the table, and resumed, &ldquo;I saw by my glass that that damned,
    cut-throat blackbirder, Bilker, is her skipper. That&rsquo;s enough for me.
    I heard that the infernal scoundrel got ten years in gaol. Sorry he wasn&rsquo;t
    hanged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vy,&rdquo; said the German, whose face was considerably flushed by
    the liquor he had been drinking, &ldquo;you vas in der plackpird drade yourselves
    von dime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I was, Peter,&rdquo; said Blount quietly, &ldquo;but <i>we</i> did
    the thing honestly, fairly and squarely. I, and those with me, when I was
    in the labour trade, never stole a nigger, nor killed one. This fellow Bilker
    was a disgrace to every white man in the trade. He is a notorious, cold-blooded
    murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The conversation fell a bit flat after this, for Mr. Burrowes and Mr. Schwartzkoff
    began to feel uncomfortable. Six or seven years before, although then unknown
    to each other and living on different islands, they each had had business
    relations with Captain Bilker in the matter of supplying him with &ldquo;cargo&rdquo; during
    his cruises for &ldquo;blackbirds,&rdquo; and each of them had so carried
    on the trade that both were ultimately compelled to leave the scene of their
    operations with great haste, and take up their residence elsewhere, particularly
    as the commander of the cruiser which arrested Captain Bilker expressed a
    strong desire to make their acquaintance and let them keep him company to
    the gallows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; resumed the American, &ldquo;I guess every man hez got
    his own opinions on such things. I hev mine&mdash; Why, here&rsquo;s Mr.
    de Vere. Walk right in, sir, an&rsquo; set down; and Mister Deighton, too.
    Howdy do, parson? I&rsquo;m real glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The moment the visitors entered Blount rose to go, but the missionary, with
    good-natured, blundering persistency, pressed him back, holding his hand
    the while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. de Vere, this is Mr. Blount, a most excellent man, I do assure
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said Blount, taking the smiling Englishman&rsquo;s
    hand in his, but quickly dropping it. There was something in De Vere&rsquo;s
    set smile and cold, watery-blue eyes that he positively resented, although
    he knew not why.</p>
  <p>However, as the somewhat dull-minded Deighton seemed very anxious for him
    to stay and engage in &ldquo;doing the polite&rdquo; to his guest, Blount
    resumed his seat, but did so with restraint and impatience showing strongly
    in his sun-burnt, resolute face. For some ten minutes or so he remained,
    speaking only when he was spoken to; and then he rose, and nodding a cool &ldquo;good-day&rdquo; to
    the handsome Mr. de Vere and the two traders, he strode to the door and walked
    out.</p>
  <p>Before he was half-way from Burrowes&rsquo; house to the mission station,
    he was overtaken by the Rev. Mr. Deighton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. de Vere has gone on board again,&rdquo; he said in his slow,
    solemn way, &ldquo;gone on board to get me some English papers. A most estimable
    and kind gentleman, Mr. Blount, an aristocrat to the backbone, but a gentleman,
    Mr. Blount, a gentleman above all. His visit has given me the most unalloyed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He may be very kind,&rdquo; said Blount, &ldquo;but my judgment has
    gone very much astray if he is what he represents himself to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blount!&rdquo; and the missionary looked genuinely shocked. &ldquo;You
    are very unjust, as well as very much in error. Mr. de Vere is a scion of
    one of the noblest of our many noble English families. He told me so himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, did he! That just confirms me in my opinion of him. Now, look
    here, Mr. Deighton,&rdquo; and his tone became slightly irritated,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    not surprised that this Mr. de Vere&mdash;who, whatever he is, is <i>not</i> a
    scion of any noble English family&mdash;should impose upon men like Burrowes
    and the German, but that he should impose on you does rather surprise me.
    And yet I don&rsquo;t know. It is always the way, or nearly always the way,
    that those whose education and intelligence should be a safeguard to them
    against imposture, are as often imposed upon as the ignorant and uncultured.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Imposture, Mr. Blount! Do you mean to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean to say that this man De Vere with his flashy get-up and imposing
    name is <i>not</i> an English gentleman. He may deceive you and the men we
    have just left, but he doesn&rsquo;t deceive me. I once lived in England
    a long time ago, Mr. Deighton,&rdquo; here Blount turned his face away, and
    then added dreamily, &ldquo;a long time, a very long time ago, and met some
    fairly decent people. And I no more believe that Mr. de Vere comes from a
    good family than I do that Nathaniel Burrowes, a low, broken-down New Orleans
    wharf-loafer, comes from one of the &lsquo;first families in Virginia&rsquo; that
    American newspapers are always blathering about&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is wrong
    with him, Mr. Blount?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing from your point of view&mdash;everything
    from mine. And, so far as I am concerned, I don&rsquo;t mean to have anything
    to do with these two English gentlemen and the yacht <i>Starlight</i>. Well,
    here we are at the mission. Good-day, Mr. Deighton; I&rsquo;m going to Lak-a-lak
    to see how my timber-getters are doing.&rdquo; And with a kindly nod at the
    troubled missionary, the big, dark-faced trader strode along the beach alone.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3<br>
    Banderah</b></h3>
  <p>Banderah, the supreme chief of Mayou, was, <i>vide</i> Mr. Deighton&rsquo;s
    report to his clerical superiors, &ldquo;a man of much intelligence, favourably
    disposed to the spread of the Gospel, but, alas! of a worldly nature, and
    clinging for worldly reasons to the darkness.&rdquo; In other words, Banderah,
    although by no means averse to the poorer natives of the island adopting
    Christianity in a very free and modified form, and contributing a certain
    amount of their possessions to the missionary cause, was yet a heathen, and
    intended to remain one. For Mr. Deighton he had conceived a personal liking,
    mingled with a wondering and contemptuous pity. During an intertribal war
    he had received a bullet in his thigh, which the missionary had succeeded,
    after much difficulty, in extracting. Consequently, his gratitude was unlimited,
    and he evinced it in a very practical manner, by commanding some hundreds
    of his subjects to become Christians under pain of death. And, being aware
    that polygamy would not be tolerated by Mr. Deighton, he went a step further,
    and ordered all those of these forced converts who had more than one wife
    to send them to his own harem. This addition to his family duties, was, however,
    amply compensated for by the labour of the surplus wives proving useful to
    him on his yam and taro plantations.</p>
  <p>In his younger days Banderah had once made a voyage to Sydney, in the service
    of a trading captain, one Lannigan, whose name, in those days, was a name
    to conjure with from one end of Melanesia to the other, and for whose valour
    as a fighter and killer of men Banderah had acquired a respect he could never
    entertain for a missionary. This captain, however, died in Sydney, full of
    years and strong drink, and left the chief almost broken-hearted, to return
    a year later to Mayou.</p>
  <p>In his curious, semi-savage character there were some good points, and one
    was that in compliance with the oft-expressed wishes and earnest entreaties
    of Blount and Mr. Deighton, he had agreed to put down the last remnants of
    cannibalism which had lingered among the coast tribes on the island down
    to the time of this story. And although the older men, and some of the priests
    of the heathen faith, had struggled against his drastic legislation, they
    finally gave in when Mr. Deighton, weeping tears of honest joy at such a
    marvellous and wholesale conversion, presented each convert with a new print
    shirt and a highly coloured picture of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea.</p>
  <p>An hour after Blount had walked along the beach to Lak-a-lak, Banderah saw
    the captain of the schooner come ashore and walk up the path to Nathaniel
    Burrowes&rsquo; house, where he was warmly greeted by Burrowes and the German.
    He remained there for nearly an hour, and then came out again, and looking
    about him for a few moments, made direct for Banderah&rsquo;s house, which
    stood about three hundred yards back from that of the American trader.</p>
  <p>When close to the chiefs house the captain of the <i>Starlight</i> raised
    his head, and Banderah caught sight of his features and recognised him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How are you, Bandy?&rdquo; said the seaman, walking smartly up to
    the chief, who was sitting on a mat inside his doorway, surrounded by a part
    of his harem and family, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t forgotten me, have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir. I no forget you,&rdquo; said the native, civilly enough,
    but without warmth. &ldquo;How are you, Cap&rsquo;en Bilker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sh&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t call me that, Bandy. I&rsquo;m Captain Sykes
    now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; and Banderah&rsquo;s face at once assumed an expression
    of the most hopeless stupidity. &ldquo;All right, Cap&rsquo;en Sike. Come
    inside an&rsquo; sit down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, my boy,&rdquo; said Bilker genially, fumbling in his coat
    pocket, and producing a large flask of rum, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you
    a drink, Bandy; and I want to have a yarn with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and taking the flask from the captain&rsquo;s hand
    without deigning to look at it, he passed it on to one of his wives. &ldquo;What
    you want talk me about, Cap&rsquo;en? You want me to get you some native
    for work on plantation?&rdquo; and he smiled slily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Bandy. Nothing like that I don&rsquo;t run a labour ship
    now. I&rsquo;m a big fellow gentleman now. I&rsquo;m captain of that yacht.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chief nodded, but said nothing. He knew Captain &ldquo;Sykes&rdquo; of
    old, and knew him to be an undoubted rascal. Indeed, about ten years before
    the cunning blackbirder captain had managed to take thirty of Banderah&rsquo;s
    people away in his ship without paying for them; and the moment the chief
    recognised the sailor he set his keen native brain to work to devise a plan
    for getting square with him. And he meant to take deadly vengeance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Banderah, old man,&rdquo; and the captain laid one hand on the chiefs
    naked knee, &ldquo;I meant to pay you for those men when I came back next
    trip. But I was taken by a man-of-war,&rdquo; here Bilker crossed his wrists
    to signify that he had been handcuffed; &ldquo;taken to Sydney, put me in
    calaboose&mdash;ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; said Banderah quietly, but with a danger spark in
    his eye, &ldquo;man-o&rsquo;-war no make you fas&rsquo; for a long time after
    you steal my men. Plenty people tell me you make two more voyage; then man-o&rsquo;-war
    catch you an&rsquo; make you fas&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe &rsquo;em, Banderah,&rdquo; began the ex-blackbirder,
    when the chief interrupted him&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What you do with my brother?&rdquo; he said suddenly;  &ldquo;he
    die too, in Fiji?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The white man&rsquo;s face paled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Banderah. I
    didn&rsquo;t know your brother was aboard when my mate put the hatches on.
    I thought he had gone ashore. I never meant to take him away to Fiji anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right; never mind that. But what you want talk to me about?&rdquo; And
    then, as if to put his visitor at his ease, he added,  &ldquo;You dam rogue,
    me dam rogue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; assented Captain Bilker cheerfully;  &ldquo;but
    look here now, Bandy, I&rsquo;m not only going to pay you for those men I
    took, but give you a lot of money as well&mdash;any amount of money; make
    you a big, rich chief; big as Maafu Tonga.{*} But I want you to help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">* Maafu of Tonga, the once dreaded rival of King Cacobau of Fiji. He died
    in 1877.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You speak me true?&rdquo; inquired the chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; answered the captain promptly, extending his hand,
    which, however, Banderah did not appear to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said presently, after a silence of a few moments;
    then making a sign for his women and slaves to withdraw to the further end
    of the room, so that their muttered talk might not disturb the white man
    and himself, he lit his pipe and said, &ldquo;Go on, tell me what you want
    me to do, Cap&rsquo;en.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the ex-blackbirder, laying a finger on the chiefs
    arm and speaking in a low voice, &ldquo;these two white men on board the
    yacht have got any amount of money, gold, sovereigns&mdash;boxes and boxes
    of it They stole it; I know they stole it, although I didn&rsquo;t see them
    do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Banderah nodded his huge, frizzy head. &ldquo;I savee. These two fellow
    rogue, all same you an&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, now, look here, Banderah. I mean to have that gold, and I want
    you to help me to get it. As soon as these men on board are dead I will give
    you a thousand golden sovereigns&mdash;five thousand dollar. Then I&rsquo;ll
    go away in the schooner. Now, listen, and I&rsquo;ll tell you how to do it.
    The Yankee and Peter are going to help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Captain Bilker, <i>alias</i> Sykes, unfolded his plan as follows: Banderah
    was to entice De Vere and his friend some miles into the interior, where
    there was a large swamp covered with wild-fowl. Here they were to be clubbed
    by Banderah and his people, and the bodies thrown into the swamp. Then Bilker,
    accompanied by Schwartzkoff and Burrowes, were to go on board the schooner
    and settle the mate and the white steward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much sovereign you goin&rsquo; to give Peter and Missa Burrowes?&rdquo; asked
    Banderah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five hundred,&rdquo; answered Bilker; &ldquo;five hundred between
    them. But I will give you a thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You no &rsquo;fraid man-o&rsquo;-war catch you by and by?&rdquo;  inquired
    Banderah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Who&rsquo;s going to tell about it? You and your people won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What &rsquo;bout Missa Blount? What &rsquo;bout mission&rsquo;ry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bilker grinned savagely. &ldquo;Peter and Burrowes say they will kill Blount
    if I give them another five hundred sovereigns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What &rsquo;bout mission&rsquo;ry and mission&rsquo;ry woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two Bilker, crime-hardened villain as he was, hesitated.
    Then he raised his head and looked into the dark face of the native chief.
    Its set, savage expression gave him confidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plenty missionaries get killed. And, all the man-o&rsquo;-war captains
    know that the Mayou bush-men{*} are very savage. Some day&mdash;in about
    a week after I have gone away in the schooner, you will take the missionary
    and his wife to the little bush town, that Peter and Burrowes tell me he
    goes to sometimes. They will sleep there that night. You and some of your
    people will go with them and sleep in the same house with them. You do that
    sometimes, Banderah, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">* &ldquo;Bushmen,&rdquo; a term applied to natives living in the interior
    of the Melanesian Islands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was perfectly true. The bush tribes on Mayou, although at war with
    Banderah and his coast tribes, yet occasionally met their foes in an amicable
    manner at a bush village called Rogga, which had been for many decades a
    neutral ground. Here Banderah and his people, carrying fish, tobacco, and
    bamboos filled with salt water,{*} would meet small parties of bush people,
    who, in exchange for the commodities brought by Banderah, would give him
    yams, hogs, and wild pigeons. At several of these meetings Mr. Deighton had
    been present, in the vain hope that he might establish friendly relations
    with the savage and cannibal people of the interior.</p>
  <p class="note">* Having no salt, the bush tribes of Melanesia, who dare not visit the coast,
    buy salt water from the coast tribes. They meet at a spot which is always
    sacredly kept as a neutral ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed the ruffian, &ldquo;you will sleep at Rogga
    with the missionary and his wife. In the morning, when you and your people
    awake, the missionary and his wife will be dead. Then you will hurry to this
    place; you will go on board the man-of-war and tell the captain that the
    bad bushmen killed them when they were asleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I savee. Everybody savee Mayou man-a-bush like kill white men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Bandy. No one will say you did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What &rsquo;bout Peter an&rsquo; Burrowes? Perhaps by and by those
    two fellow get mad with me some day, and tell man-o&rsquo;-war I bin kill
    three white man and one white woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Banderah,&rdquo; and Bilker slapped him on the shoulder, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
    a damned smart fellow! There&rsquo;s no mistake about that. Now look here,
    I want you to get another thousand sovereigns&mdash;the thousand I am going
    to give to Burrowes and Peter. And after the man-a-bush have killed the missionary
    and his wife, they are coming down to the beach one night soon after, and
    will kill the two white men. Then there will be no more white men left, and
    you&rsquo;ll be the biggest chief in the world&mdash;as big as Maafu Tonga.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A curious smile stole over the grim features of the chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God! Cap&rsquo;en, you savee too much; you dam fine man altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look here now, Banderah. Are you going to do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do it right enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-mollow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow will do. And, look here, Bandy, I&rsquo;m going to give
    you ten sovereigns each for the men I took away from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered the chief, &ldquo;now you go away. I want
    go and look out for some good men come along me to-mollow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right you are, Banderah. Take plenty good men. You know what to do&mdash;white
    men walk along swamp to shoot duck, then <i>one, two,</i>&rdquo;  and Captain
    Bilker made a motion with his right hand that was perfectly comprehensible
    to the chief.</p>
  <p>Banderah sat perfectly quiet on his mat and watched the captain return to
    Burrowes&rsquo; house, from where a short time after he emerged, accompanied
    by his two fellow-conspirators. Then the three of them hailed the schooner.
    A boat put off and took them on board.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>An hour or two later Blount returned along the beach from Lak-a-lak, and
    walked slowly up the path to his house. Just as he entered the door the sounds
    of revelry came over to him from the schooner, whose lights were beginning
    to glimmer through the quick-falling darkness of the tropic night. Some one
    on board was playing an accordion, and presently he caught the words of a
    song&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember, too, the patriots&rsquo; gore<br>
    That flecked the streets of Baltimore;<br>
    Maryland, my Maryland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Burrowes only sings that when he&rsquo;s very drunk,&rdquo;  he said
    to himself, as he sat down to drink a cup of coffee brought to him by his
    eldest daughter Taya. &ldquo;No doubt he and that anointed sweep Bilker are
    having a very happy time together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the girl in the native tongue, as he put down
    his cup, &ldquo;Banderah is here. He came but now, and will not come inside,
    but waits for thee in the copra-house, lest he be seen talking to thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil is wrong?&rdquo; muttered Blount, as without waiting
    to touch the coffee prepared for him he went outside to the copra-house.</p>
  <p>In half an hour he and the native chief came out together, and as they stood
    for a minute in the broad streak of light that streamed out from the lamp
    on the table in the big room, Taya, who sat in the doorway, saw her father&rsquo;s
    face was set and stern-looking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shed thou no blood, Banderah,&rdquo; he said in the native tongue, &ldquo;not
    even that of these two dogs who have eaten and drunk in my house for four
    years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Challi,{*} that is hard. Already are my people thirsty for the blood
    of this dog of a captain&mdash;he who stole thirty and one of my people.
    And because of my brother, who was stolen with them, have I promised them
    vengeance. But the other two who are with him on the ship I will spare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">* Charlie</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you will. And as for these two dogs who have planned to kill me,
    with them I shall deal myself. If, when the schooner saileth away from here,
    these men go not with her, then shall I shoot them dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; and then grasping the white man&rsquo;s hand, the chief
    pressed his nose to his, and vanished in the darkness.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4<br>
  &ldquo;Death To Them Both!&rdquo;</b></h3>
  <p>Early on the following morning Messrs. de Vere and Morcombe-Lycett&mdash;the
    latter being now quite recovered&mdash;informed Mr. and Mrs. Deighton that,
    having heard from the two traders there was good shooting at the big swamp,
    they were going there under the guidance of Banderah and a party of natives;
    and shortly after breakfast the chief, accompanied by a number of his people,
    appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will send with you two of my best men,&rdquo; said Mr. Deighton,
    indicating a couple of his pet converts, who stood by dressed for the occasion
    in white starched shirts and black coats, but minus trousers, of which garments
    the pet converts had divested themselves, knowing that they should have to
    wade through the swamp.</p>
  <p>But suddenly, to the missionary&rsquo;s astonishment, Banderah, with a savage
    look, bade them stay where they were. He had, he said, plenty of men, and
    did not need Mr. Deighton&rsquo;s servants.</p>
  <p>Presently the two yachting gentlemen, arrayed in a very stylish sporting
    get-up, appeared with their breach-loaders and cartridge-belts, and waving
    their hands gracefully to the missionary and his wife, disappeared with Banderah
    and his dark-skinned companions into the dense tropical jungle, the edge
    of which was within a very short distance of the mission station.</p>
  <p>For about an hour the Honourable Morcombe-Lycett and Mr. de Vere, with Banderah
    leading the way, walked steadily onward through the jungle. Not a word was
    spoken among the natives who followed close at their heels, and Banderah
    himself, in answer to their frequent questions, replied only by monosyllables.</p>
  <p>At last they came out of the stifling heat of the thick jungle, and saw
    before them a great reedy swamp, the margin fringed by a scanty growth of
    cocoanut and pandanus palms. Out upon the open patches of water, here and
    there showing upon the broad expanse of the swamp, they saw large flocks
    of wild duck feeding and swimming about, betraying not the slightest fear
    at their approach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Jove, Baxter,&rdquo; said Mr. de Vere to his friend, &ldquo;looks
    good enough, doesn&rsquo;t it? I wonder if these blasted niggers will go
    in for us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course they will. But let us have a drink first. Here, you, bring
    us that basket. I wonder what sort of tucker old Godliness has given us.
    He&rsquo;s not a bad sort of an ass. His wife, too, isn&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; and Mr. de Vere twirled his long, yellow moustache, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
    always finding out something nice in the face of every woman you come across.
    Wait until we get up to Japan; then you can amuse yourself with a new type
    of woman. Be a bit of a change for you after the Melbourne and Sydney peroxided-hair
    beauties. Here, nigger, give me that corkscrew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Dalton,&rdquo; suddenly remarked his friend, &ldquo;&rsquo;pon
    my soul I believe we are making a mistake in going to Japan. You may be sure
    that we&rsquo;ll have a lot of trouble awaiting us there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it Before we get there every one will have read the
    cable news that we have been seen in Callao, and no one in Yokohama will
    ever think of associating Mr. Herbert de Vere and the Honourable Morcombe-Lycett&mdash;just
    arrived from Manila <i>via</i> Singapore in the Spanish mail-steamer&mdash;with&mdash;er&mdash;hum&mdash;the
    two gentlemen who arrived at Callao from Tahiti, after successfully diddling
    the Australian financial public of thirty thousand quid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what are we going to do with the schooner at Manila?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sell her, my innocent! Sell her to our esteemed friend, Mr. Moses
    Steinberg, who has assisted me in previous financial transactions&mdash;before
    I had the pleasure of meeting my present valued colleague, the Honourable
    Mr. Morcombe-Lycett&mdash;and who is now taking care to inform the world
    that we are living in South America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how are we going to account for our boxes of sovereigns? Two
    mining speculators don&rsquo;t usually carry about heavy sums in gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All managed, my boy. My friend, Mr. Moses Steinberg, will see to
    that. The ten thousand sovereigns will be valuable gold specimens from Queensland,
    and will be placed on board the North German Lloyd&rsquo;s steamer at Singapore
    for safe conveyance to London, where you and I, my dear boy, will follow
    it. And there also we shall find, I trust, an additional sum of fifteen thousand
    lying to our credit&mdash;the proceeds of our honest toil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with Sykes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give him &pound;500 and tell him to hold his tongue. He&rsquo;s a
    thundering rascal, and we must pay to shut his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the two proceeded to discuss their lunch, and as they ate and drank
    and talked and laughed, Banderah and three or four of his men whispered together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seize them from behind and bind them tightly,&rdquo;  said the chief, &ldquo;but
    kill them not, for that I have promised to Challi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Honourable Morcombe-Lycett had just finished his last glass of bottled
    beer and wanted to smoke. He had taken out his cigar-case, and, wondering
    at the sudden silence which had fallen upon their native guides, turned round
    to see where they were, and saw swiftly advancing upon himself and his companion
    some half a dozen stalwart natives. In that momentary glance he read danger,
    and quick as lightning&mdash;for he was no coward&mdash;he seized his loaded
    gun, which lay beside him, and fired both barrels one after another, at not
    ten yards&rsquo; range.</p>
  <p>A chorus of savage yells answered the shots, as two of the natives fell,
    but ere he could reload or Dalton could fire there came a fierce rush of
    all the dark-skinned men upon them, and, struggling madly for their lives,
    they were borne down.</p>
  <p>And then the lust of slaughter overcame their fierce assailants, and despite
    Banderah and two or three of his most trusted men, a club was raised and
    fell swiftly upon the white, fair forehead of &ldquo;Mr. de Vere&rdquo; as
    he sought to tear away his hands from the vice-like grasp of two huge natives
    who held them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to them both!&rdquo; cried a thin-faced, wrinkled old man named
    Toka; &ldquo;<i>hutu</i>:{*} for the lives of the thirty and one.&rdquo; Then
    springing out from the rest, he swung a short-handled, keen-bladed hatchet
    over his head, and sank it into the brain of the wretched Baxter.</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Synonymous with Maori <i>utu</i>&mdash;revenge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand thou aside, Banderah, son of Paylap,&rdquo;  screamed the old
    man, waving the bloody hatchet fiercely at him. &ldquo;I, old Toka, the priest,
    will to-day again show the men of Mayou how to drink the blood and eat the
    flesh of the long pigs the gods have given into our hands,&rdquo; and again
    he buried the weapon in Baxter&rsquo;s breathless body. And as Banderah looked
    at the old man&rsquo;s working face, and saw the savage mouth, flecked with
    foam, writhing and twisting in horrible contortions, and then saw the almost
    equally dreadful visages of the rest of his men, he knew that the old, old
    lust for human flesh had come upon them.</p>
  <p>So, with the one idea of saving Blount and the missionary and his wife,
    he turned and fled through the forest towards the beach.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5<br>
    The Tapu Of Banderah</b></h3>
  <p>The Rev. Wilfrid and Mrs. Deighton were at lunch, talking about the genial
    manners and other qualifications of their guests, when suddenly they heard
    a rapid step on the verandah, and Blount dashed into the room.</p>
  <p>His face was white with excitement, and they saw that he carried his revolver
    in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What in heaven&rsquo;s name is wrong, Mr. Blount? Why are you armed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t ask me now! Our lives are in danger&mdash;deadly,
    imminent danger. Follow me to my house!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; began Mr. Deighton, &ldquo;I do not see&mdash;I
    fail&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Man, don&rsquo;t talk! Do you think I do not know what I am saying?
    Your two friends are both murdered. Banderah is now at my house, too exhausted
    to tell me more than to come and save you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear, dear me! Oh, this is dreadful! Let us, Alice, my dear, seek
    Divine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; and the trader seized the missionary by the arm
    as he was about to sink upon his knees. &ldquo;Stay here and pray if you
    like&mdash;and get your throat cut. In ten&mdash;in five minutes more, every
    native except Banderah will be here ready to burn and murder. I tell you,
    man, that our only chance of safety is to reach my house first, and then
    the schooner. Come, Mrs. Deighton. For God&rsquo;s sake, come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pushing past the missionary, he seized Mrs. Deighton by the hand and descended
    the steps. They had scarcely gone two hundred yards when they heard a strange,
    awful cry peal through the woods; and Mr. Deighton shuddered. Only once before
    had he heard such a cry, and that was when, during the early days of the
    mission, he had seen a native priest tear out the heart of a victim destined
    for a cannibal feast, and hold it up to the people.</p>
  <p>Suddenly little Mrs. Deighton gasped and tottered as they hurried her along;
    she was already exhausted. Then Deighton stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blount... go on by yourself. We have not your strength to run
    at this speed. I will help my wife along in a minute or two. Some of the
    mission people will surely come to our aid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will they?&rdquo; said Blount grimly. &ldquo;Look for yourself and
    see; there&rsquo;s not a soul in the whole village. They have gone to see&mdash;&rdquo; and
    he made an expressive gesture.</p>
  <p>Mr. Deighton groaned. &ldquo;My God, it is terrible!&mdash;&rdquo;  then
    suddenly, as he saw his wife&rsquo;s deathly features, his real nature came
    out  &ldquo;Mr. Blount, you are a brave man. For God&rsquo;s sake save my
    dear wife! I am too exhausted to run any further. I am too weak from my last
    attack of the fever. But we are only a quarter of a mile away from your house
    now. Take her on with you, but give me your revolver. I can at least cover
    your retreat for a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blount hesitated, then giving the weapon to the missionary, he lifted the
    fainting woman in his arms, and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try and come on a little; as soon as I am in sight of the house your
    wife will be safe; you must at least keep me in sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the trader strode along, carrying the unconscious woman in his strong
    arms, the missionary looked at the weapon in his hand, and shuddered again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May God forgive me if I have done wrong,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;But
    take the life of one of His creatures to save my own I never will. Yet to
    save hers I must do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then with trembling feet but brave heart he walked unsteadily along after
    the trader and his burden. So far, no sound had reached him since that one
    dreadful cry smote upon his ear, and a hope began to rise in his breast that
    no immediate danger threatened. A short distance away, embowered among the
    trees, was the house of Burrowes. The door was closed, and not a sign of
    life was discernible about the place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens, were they asleep?&rdquo; He had heard that Burrowes and
    the German had been carousing all the morning with the captain of the <i>Starlight</i>.
    Likely enough they were all lying in a drunken slumber.  &ldquo;God, give
    me strength to warn them,&rdquo; he said to himself; and then with a last
    glance at Blount and his wife, he resolutely turned aside and began to ascend
    the hill.</p>
  <p>But before he gained the summit, Blount had reached the fence surrounding
    his house, and Banderah and Taya and her two young brothers, rifles in hand,
    met the trader.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, take her!&rdquo; and he pushed Mrs. Deighton into Taya&rsquo;s
    arms and looked back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God! he&rsquo;s going up to Burrowes&rsquo; house! Come, Banderah,&rdquo; and
    he started back again, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be speared or shot before he gets
    there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just as the missionary reached the door and began in feeble, exhausted tones
    to call out, Blount and the chief caught up to him, and seizing his hands
    dragged him away again down the hill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about them, they are all on board,&rdquo; was
    all Blount said. And there was no time to talk, for now fierce cries were
    heard in the direction of the mission house, and Blount and Banderah, looking
    back, saw black, naked figures leap over the low stone wall enclosing the
    missionary&rsquo;s dwelling and disappear inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; muttered the trader, as dragging Mr. Deighton
    between them they gained the house, and sat the missionary down beside his
    wife, who with a cry of thankfulness threw her arms about his neck and then
    quietly fainted.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>For nearly half an hour Blount, with Banderah and the missionary by his
    side, looked out through the windows and saw the natives plundering and wrecking
    the mission house and the dwellings of Schwartzkoff and Burrowes. A mile
    away, motionless upon the glassy waters of the harbour, lay the schooner,
    with her boat astern, and every now and then Blount would take a look at
    her through his glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a soul on deck,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Deighton. &ldquo;I
    heard that Peter and Burrowes went off this morning with the captain, all
    pretty well drunk. Would to God I knew what is best to do! To go on board
    would perhaps mean that those ruffians would shoot us down before we were
    alongside. No, we&rsquo;ll stay here and take our chance. Banderah says he
    feels pretty sure that he can protect us from his own people. They&rsquo;d
    never dare to hurt him; and I think <i>that</i> will steady them a bit,&rdquo; and
    he pointed to the fence, upon which, at intervals, were tied green cocoanut
    boughs. These had just been placed there by Banderah himself, and meant that
    the house was <i>tapu</i>&mdash;it and all in it were sacred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God grant it may!&rdquo; said Mr. Deighton, and looking at the mystic
    sign, the use of which he had so often tried to put down as a silly, heathenish
    practice, he felt a twinge of conscience.</p>
  <p>At last the work of plunder was over, and then Blount saw a swarm of black,
    excited savages, led by two or three  &ldquo;devil-doctors&rdquo; or priests,
    advance towards the house. At the same moment Banderah, looking seaward,
    saw that the boat had left the schooner and was pulling ashore. He was just
    about to point her out to the trader when, for some reason, he changed his
    mind, turned away, and joined his white friends at the other end of the room.</p>
  <p>Following the lead of the &ldquo;devil-doctors,&rdquo; who, stripped to
    the waist, and with their heads covered with the hideous masks used in their
    incantations, looked like demons newly arisen from the pit, the yelling swarm
    of natives at last reached the fence outside Blount&rsquo;s house; and Mr.
    Deighton, with an inward groan, saw among them some of his pet converts,
    stark naked and armed with spears and clubs.</p>
  <p>Leaping and dancing with mad gyrations, and uttering curious grunting sounds
    as their feet struck the ground, the devil-doctors at last came within a
    few feet of the gate in the trader&rsquo;s fence. Then, suddenly, as they
    caught sight of a branch of cocoanut leaf twisted in and around the woodwork
    of the gate, they stopped their maddened whirl as if by magic; and upon those
    behind them fell the silence of fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; muttered Blount, &ldquo;we are safe. They will
    not break Banderah&rsquo;s <i>tapu</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, rifle in hand, and with quiet, unmoved face, Banderah opened the trader&rsquo;s
    door and came out before them all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who among ye desires the life of Banderah and those to whom he has
    given his <i>tapu?</i>&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>The smaller of the two priests dashed aside his mask, and revealed the face
    of the old man Toka, who had struck Baxter his death-blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who indeed, O chief? If it be to thy mind to make <i>tapu</i> this
    house and all in it, who is there dare break it? To the white man Challi
    and his sons and daughters we meant no harm, though sweet to our bellies
    will be the flesh of those whom we have slain and who now roast for the feast.
    But more are yet to come; for I, Toka, lost my son, when thou, Banderah,
    lost thy brother; and the gods have told me that I shall eat my fill of those
    who stole him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The savage, bitter hatred that rang through the old man&rsquo;s voice, and
    the deep, approving murmur of those who stood about him, warned both Banderah
    and Blount that the lust for slaughter was not yet appeased; so it was with
    a feeling of intense surprise and relief that he and the missionary saw them
    suddenly withdraw, and move rapidly away to the rear of the house among the
    thick jungle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s d&mdash;d curious!&rdquo; said Blount, turning to Banderah
    and speaking in English; and then the chief took him by the arm and pointed
    towards the shore&mdash;the boat, pulled by Schwartzkoff and Burrowes, with
    Captain Bilker sitting in the stern, had just touched the beach. Then it
    flashed across his mind in an instant why the natives had left so suddenly&mdash;they
    were lying in ambush for the three men!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God! bad as they are, I can&rsquo;t let them walk to their deaths,&rdquo; said
    Blount, jumping outside, so as to hail and warn them. But before he could
    utter a sound, Banderah sprang upon him and clapped his hand to his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Challi,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they must die. Try to save them, and
    we all perish. For the sake of thy daughters and of thy sons, raise not thy
    voice nor thy hand. Must all our blood run because of these three dogs&rsquo;  lives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as he spoke the end came. Staggering up the beach in drunken hilarity,
    the three whites did not notice, as they headed for the path, a file of natives,
    armed with spears and clubs, walk quietly along between them and the water&rsquo;s
    edge. There they sat down and waited. But not for long, for presently from
    out the thick, tangled jungle in front came a humming whirr of deadly arrows
    and in a few seconds the three white men were wallowing in their blood. Then
    came that bloodcurdling shout of savage triumph, telling those who heard
    it that all was over. Before its echoes died away the bleeding bodies were
    carried to where a thick, heavy smoke rising from the jungle told the shuddering
    missionary that the awful feast was preparing. When he looked again not a
    native was in sight.</p>
  <p>Standing apart in the room from the others, Blount and Banderah spoke hurriedly
    together, and then the trader came to the missionary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Deighton, if you wish to save your wife&rsquo;s and your own
    life, and escape from this slaughterhouse, now is your time. As God is my
    judge I believe we shall never be safe again, and I would gladly go with
    you if I could. But my daughter Nelly is at Lak-a-lak, and&mdash;well, that
    settles it. Banderah here will tell you that he dreads your staying, as the
    priests may plot your death at any moment. I implore you, sir, to think of
    your wife. See, there is the boat, drifting along the beach with the tide.
    For God&rsquo;s sake be advised and get on board the schooner, and whatever
    port you do reach, send a vessel to take me away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, before the missionary and his wife could realise what was happening,
    Banderah had run to the beach, swam to the boat, seized the painter, gained
    the shore again, and pulled her along till opposite the trader&rsquo;s house,
    just as Blount and Taya, supporting Mrs. Deighton between them, were leaving
    the house to meet him.</p>
  <p>In twenty minutes more they were close to the <i>Starlight</i>, and saw
    that her crew were weighing the anchor. On the after deck stood the mate
    and steward with rifles in their hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What in the name of God is wrong?&rdquo; said the mate, as the boat
    ranged up alongside, and the missionary and his wife were assisted on deck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask now, man. Get your anchor up as quick as you can
    and put to sea. Your captain and the two passengers are all dead. Clear out
    at once if you don&rsquo;t want the ship to be taken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought something was wrong when I saw the native dragging the
    boat along. Lend us a hand to get under weigh, will you?&rdquo;  and the
    mate sprang forward.</p>
  <p>In another five minutes the <i>Starlight&rsquo;s</i> anchor was up, and
    then Blount and Banderah, with a hurried farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Deighton,
    sprang into the boat and pushed off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May God bless and keep you,&rdquo; called out the missionary to Blount, &ldquo;and
    may we meet again soon;&rdquo; then sinking on his knees beside his wife,
    he raised his face to heaven, and the trader saw that tears were streaming
    down his worn and rugged cheeks.</p>
  <p>Blount never heard of the missionary and his wife again. Long, long afterwards
    he did hear that some wreckage of a vessel like the <i>Starlight</i> had
    been found on Rennel Island, and that sovereigns were discovered among the
    pools and crevices of the reef for many years after. Whether she ran ashore
    or drifted there dismasted&mdash;for a heavy gale set in a week after she
    left Mayou&mdash;is one of those mysteries of the sea that will never be
    solved.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBeginningOfTheSeaStoryOfAustralia"></a>The Beginning Of The Sea Story Of Australia</b></h2>
  <p>To many people in England the mention of Australia conjures pictures of
    tented gold-fields and tall, black-bearded, red-shirted bushrangers; of mounted
    police recruited from &ldquo;flaxen-haired younger sons of good old English
    families, well-groomed and typically Anglo-Saxon&rdquo;; of squatters and
    sheep runs; of buckjumpers ridden by the most daring riders in the world;
    and of much more to the same purpose; but never is presented a picture of
    the sea or sailor folk.</p>
  <p>Yet the first half-century of Australian history is all to do with the ocean.
    The British sailor laid the foundation of the Australian nation, and, in
    the beginning, more than any other class, the sailorman did the colonising&mdash;and
    did it well. This, however, is the story of most British possessions, and
    generally it is gratefully remembered and the sailor duly credited and kindly
    thought of for his work. But in these days the dry west wind from the back
    blocks seems to have blown the taste of brine and the sound of the seethe
    of the curling &ldquo;white horse&rdquo; out of the mind of the native-born
    Australian; and the sailing day of a mail boat is the only thing that the
    average colonial knows or cares to know about salt water.</p>
  <p>To write on such a subject as this, one has to leave out so much, that it
    is necessary to begin almost in the middle in order to reach an ending. Sea
    exploration and coast surveying opened the ways; whaling&mdash;it may surprise
    the reader, but it is nevertheless true&mdash;was once the main support of
    Australia and New Zealand; and runaway sailors formed a very considerable
    part of the back country population, such men making handier and better farm
    labourers, stockmen, and, later on, miners, by reason of their adaptability
    to strange surroundings, than ticket-of-leave men or the average free emigrant.</p>
  <p>The first four successive Governors of Australia&mdash;in the beginning,
    be it remembered, the continent was one colony&mdash;were captains in the
    Navy. Governing in those rough days was not a mere master-of-the-ceremonies
    appointment, and Phillip, Hunter, King, and Bligh, if they made mistakes,
    considering their previous training, the populations they governed and the
    times in which they lived, amply justify Palmerston&rsquo;s words that if
    he wanted a thing done well in a distant part of the world; when he wanted
    a man with a good head, a good heart, lots of pluck, and plenty of common
    sense&mdash;he would always send for a captain of the Navy.</p>
  <p>Phillip, the first of these Governors, was sent out to found &ldquo;a penal
    settlement at Botany Bay, on the coast of New Holland,&rdquo; and did the
    work in such fashion, in spite of every discouragement from the forces of
    nature, the Home Government, and his own officers, as to well entitle him
    to a place among the builders of Greater Britain. What was known of Australia,
    or rather New Holland&mdash;the name of Australia was still in futurity&mdash;in
    1788, when Phillip first landed on its shores?</p>
  <p>Let us say nothing of Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch voyages; of wrecks
    and piracies; of maroonings, and massacres by blacks; of the discoveries
    of Dampier and of Cook, but sum the whole up thus: the east coast of Australia,
    from its northernmost extremity to its southernmost, was practically unknown
    to the world, and was absolutely unknown to Englishmen until Cook&rsquo;s
    first voyage. Cook, in the <i>Endeavour</i>, ran along the whole east coast,
    entering a few bays, naming many points, and particularly describing Botany
    Bay where he stayed some little time; then he sailed through Torres Straits,
    and thence, <i>via</i> Batavia, home to England, where he arrived in June,
    1771. The English Government took no advantage of his discoveries until 1786,
    when Botany Bay was fixed upon as the site of a new penal settlement; and
    this choice was determined, more than anything else, by the advice of Sir
    Joseph Banks, who, from the time of his voyage with Cook in the <i>Endeavour</i> till
    his death, took the keenest interest in the continent; and colonists are
    more indebted to the famous naturalist for his friendly services than to
    any other civilian Englishman of the time.</p>
  <p>Phillip&rsquo;s commission ordered him to proceed to Botany Bay, but authorised
    him to choose another site for the settlement if he considered a better could
    be found. He arrived with his fleet of transports in 1788, after a voyage
    of many months&rsquo; duration, so managed that, though the fleet was the
    first to make the passage and was made up of more ships and more prisoners
    than any succeeding fleet, there was less sickness and fewer deaths than
    on any of the convoys which followed it. Phillip made a careful examination
    of Botany Bay, and finding it unsuitable for planting, the settlement was
    removed to Port Jackson. After landing the exiles, the transports returned
    to Europe <i>via</i> China and the East Indies, and their route was along
    the north-east coast of Australia. The voyages of these returning transports,
    under the navy agent, Lieutenant Shortland, were fruitful in discoveries
    and adventures.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Phillip and his officers were working hard, building their homes
    and taking their recreation in exploring the country and the coast for many
    miles around them. And with such poor means as an indifferent Home Government
    provided, this work of exploration went on continually under each naval governor,
    the pressing want of food spurring the pioneers ever on in the search for
    good land; but that very need, with the lack of vessels, of men who could
    be trusted, of all that was necessary for exploration, kept them chained
    in a measure to their base at Sydney Cove.</p>
  <p>Phillip, white-faced, cold and reserved, but with a heart full of pity,
    was responsible for the lives of a thousand people in a desolate country
    twelve thousand miles from England&mdash;so desolate that his discontented
    officers without exception agreed that the new colony was &ldquo;the most
    God-forsaken land in the world.&rdquo; The convict settlers were so ill-chosen,
    and the Government so neglected to supply them with even the barest necessities
    from Home, that for several years after their landing they were in constant
    distress from famine; and disease and death from this cause alone was an
    evil regularly to be encountered by the silent, hard-working Phillip. The
    only means of relief open to the starving settlement was by importing food
    from Batavia and the Cape of Good Hope, and to procure such supplies Phillip
    had but two ships at his disposal&mdash;the worn-out old frigate <i>Sirius</i> (which
    was lost at Norfolk Island soon after the founding of the settlement) and
    a small brig of war, the <i>Supply</i>&mdash;which for many weary months
    were the only means of communication with civilisation.</p>
  <p>The Home Government, when they did despatch a second fleet, instead of sending
    supplies for the starving people under Phillip&rsquo;s care, sent more prisoners,
    and very little to eat was sent with them. The authorities seem to have had
    an idea that a few hundred shovels, some decayed garden seeds, and a thousand
    or two of Old Bailey men and women criminals, were all the means needed to
    found a prosperous and self-supporting colony. How Phillip and his successors
    surmounted these difficulties is another story; but in the sea history of
    Australia the work of the naval governors occupies no small space in it.
    Remember, too, that the Torres Straits route and the Great Barrier Reef,
    now as well charted as the Solent, were only then being slowly discovered
    by clumsy old sailing craft, whose masters learnt to dread and avoid the
    dangers of the unknown coast as children grow cautious of fire, by actually
    touching it.</p>
  <p>Hunter, the second Governor of New South Wales, and King, the third Governor,
    both did remarkable surveying work on the coast while serving under Phillip,
    and both made still more remarkable voyages to England. Hunter was the senior
    naval officer under Phillip, and was in command of the <i>Sirius</i> when
    she was lost on Norfolk Island.</p>
  <p>This is how the dauntless Hunter got home with the crew of the <i>Sirius</i>,
    after waiting six months on Norfolk Island for the chance of a passage. The <i>Waaksamheyd</i>,
    a Dutch snow{*} of 300-tons burden, which had brought supplies to Sydney
    from Batavia, was engaged to take Hunter and his shipwrecked crew to England.
    She was <i>thirteen months</i> on the voyage, and here are some extracts
    from Hunter&rsquo;s letter to the Admiralty, written from Portsmouth on the
    23rd of April, 1792:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">* A snow differed somewhat slightly from a brig. It had two
    masts similar to the fore and mainmasts of a brig or ship, and, close abaft
    the mainmast, a topsail mast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sailed from Port Jackson on the 27th of March, 1791, victualled
    for six months and with sixty tons of water. We were one hundred and twenty-three
    people on board all told&rdquo; (remember this vessel was of three hundred
    tons burden). &ldquo;The master was directed to call at Norfolk Island to
    receive despatches, but contrary winds prevented us carrying out these orders.
    We steered to the northward and made New Caledonia, passing to the westward
    of it, as the master (a Dutchman) did not feel himself qualified to navigate
    a vessel in these unknown seas. He had, upon leaving Port Jackson, requested
    my assistance, which I gave him. In sailing to the northward we fell in with
    several islands and shoals, the situations of which we determined, and it
    is my intention, if the Navy Board will permit me, to lay a short account
    of this northern passage before the Board, when the discoveries will be particularly
    mentioned. No ship that I have heard of having sailed between New Britain
    and New Ireland since that passage was discovered by Captain Carteret in
    Her Majesty&rsquo;s sloop <i>Swallow</i>, I was the more desirous to take
    that route.... We passed through the Straits of Macassar and arrived at Batavia
    after a tedious and distressing passage of twenty-six weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After burying an officer and two seamen at Batavia, Hunter left that place
    on October 20th, reached the Cape on the 17th of December, and was driven
    to sea again after the loss of two anchors, till the 30th. So weak and ill
    were his men from the effects of their stay in the unhealthy climate of Batavia,
    that he had to remain at the Cape till the 18th of January, when he again
    put to sea and sailed for England.</p>
  <p>Hunter&rsquo;s brief and precise official account of his voyage discloses
    little of the great distress of that thirteen months&rsquo; passage; but
    it shows how the spirit of discovery was in the man; how, in spite of the
    care of one hundred and twenty-three people in a 300-ton vessel, and half
    rations, he had time and energy enough to think of surveying. One result
    of his voyage was his strongly expressed opinion that the proper route home
    from Australia was <i>via</i> Cape Horn&mdash;now the recognised homeward
    route for sailing vessels.</p>
  <p>The name of King ought never to be forgotten, for the services of father
    and son in Australian waters were very great. King, the elder, came out with
    Phillip as second lieutenant of the crazy old <i>Sirius</i>. He had previously
    served under Phillip in the East Indies, and soon after the arrival of the
    first fleet in &ldquo;Botany Bay,&rdquo; as New South Wales was then called,
    he was sent with a detachment of Marines and a number of convicts to colonise
    Norfolk Island. His task was a hard one, but he accomplished it in the face
    of almost heartbreaking difficulties.</p>
  <p>Phillip, finding that his despatches failed to awaken the Home Government
    to a sense of the deplorable situation of the colony he had founded at Port
    Jackson, determined to send home a man who would represent the true state
    of affairs. He chose King for the service. Every other officer&mdash;both
    naval and military&mdash;was ready to go, and would have eloquently described
    the miseries of the colonists, and harped on the necessity for an instant
    abandonment of the settlement&mdash;they were writing letters to this effect
    by every chance they could get to forward them&mdash;but this was not what
    Phillip wanted. He, and he alone, recognised the future possibilities of
    New South Wales, writing even at the time of his deepest distress: &ldquo;This
    will be the greatest acquisition Great Britain has ever made.&rdquo; All
    he asked was for reasonable help in the way of food and decent settlers who
    could work. All he got in answer to his requests was the further shipment
    of the scum of the gaols and the hulks&mdash;and some more spades and seeds.
    King believed in his chief and cordially worked with him&mdash;and King was
    the silent Phillip&rsquo;s one friend.</p>
  <p>So King went home, his voyage thither being one of the most singular ever
    made by naval officer. He left Sydney Cove in April, 1790, and after a tedious
    passage reached Batavia. Here he engaged a small Dutch vessel to take him
    to the Cape of Good Hope, sailing for that port in August. Before the ship
    had been a week at sea, save four men, the whole crew, including the master,
    were stricken with the hideous &ldquo;putrid fever&rdquo;&mdash;a common
    disease in &ldquo;country&rdquo;  ships at that time. King, a quick and masterful
    man, took command, and with his four well men lived on deck in a tent to
    escape contagion. The rest of the ship&rsquo;s company, which included a
    surgeon, lay below delirious, and one after another of them dying&mdash;seventeen
    of them died in a fortnight.</p>
  <p>King tells how, when handling the bodies to throw them overboard, he and
    his men covered their mouths with sponges soaked in vinegar to prevent contagion.
    In this short-handed condition he navigated the vessel to the Mauritius,
    where, &ldquo;having heard of the misunderstanding with the French&rdquo; the
    gallant officer refused to take passage in a French frigate; but procuring
    a new crew worked his way to the Cape, where he arrived in September, reaching
    England in December, after a passage which altogether occupied eight months&mdash;a
    letter from England to Australia and a reply to it now occupies about ten
    weeks.</p>
  <p>In England King was well received, being confirmed in his appointment as
    Commandant of Norfolk Island, and he succeeded in getting some help for his
    fellow-colonists. Upon his return to his island command the little colony
    proved a great worry. The military guard mutinied, and King armed the convict
    settlers to suppress the mutiny! This act of his gave great offence in some
    quarters. Phillip had resigned the command at Sydney, and the Lieutenant-Governor
    of the colony, who was in charge, was the commanding officer of the New South
    Wales Regiment&mdash;more celebrated in the records for its mutinies than
    its services&mdash;and the degradation of the Norfolk Island detachment by
    King was never forgiven by the soldiers, but the Home Government quite approved
    his conduct.</p>
  <p>But King made one very serious mistake. He had sent a vessel to New Zealand,
    and from thence had imported certain Maori chiefs to instruct the settlers
    on Norfolk Island in flax cultivation.</p>
  <p>King had pledged his word to these noble savages to return them to their
    native country, and in order to do so, and make sure of their getting there,
    he himself embarked in a vessel, leaving his command for a few days to the
    charge of his subordinate, while he sailed the thirteen hundred miles to
    New Zealand and back. For this he was censured, but was notwithstanding afterwards
    appointed the third Governor of New South Wales, succeeding Hunter.</p>
  <p>King&rsquo;s son, who was born at Norfolk Island in 1791, entered the Navy
    in 1807, and saw any amount of fighting in the French war; then went to Australia
    in 1817, and surveyed its eastern coast in such a manner that, when he returned
    to England in 1823 there was little but detail work left for those who followed
    him. Then he was appointed to the <i>Adventure</i>, which, in conjunction
    with the <i>Beagle</i>, surveyed the South American coast. In 1830 he retired
    and settled in Australia, dying there in 1856. His son in turn entered the
    service, but early followed his father&rsquo;s example, and turned farmer
    in Australia. He still lives, and is a member of the Legislative Council
    or Upper House of the New South Wales Parliament.</p>
  <p>Here is a family record! Three generations, all naval officers, and all
    men who have taken an active share in the founding and growth of Greater
    Britain; and yet not one man in a thousand in Australia, much less in England,
    has probably the remotest idea of the services rendered to the Empire by
    this family.</p>
  <p>The fourth and last naval Governor, Bligh, is more often remembered in connection
    with the <i>Bounty</i> mutiny than for his governorship of New South Wales.
    He was deposed by the military in 1808, for his action in endeavouring to
    suppress the improper traffic in rum which was being carried on by the officers
    of the New South Wales Regiment. This second mutiny, of which he was the
    victim, certainly cannot be blamed against the honesty of his administration;
    and the assertion, so often repeated, that he hid himself under his bed when
    the mutinous soldiers&mdash;who had been well primed with rum by their officers&mdash;marched
    to Government House, can best be answered by the statement that Nelson publicly
    thanked him for his skill and gallantry at Copenhagen, and by the heroism
    which he showed in the most remarkable boat voyage in history. He may have
    been the most tyrannical and overbearing naval officer that ever entered
    the service, but he was not the man to hide himself under a bed.</p>
  <p>There were other naval officers of the early Australian days whose services
    were no less valuable to the infant colony. Think of the men associated with
    this time, and of the names famous in history, which are in some way linked
    with Australia. Dampier, Cook, La P&eacute;rouse, Bligh, Edwards and the <i>Pandora</i>,
    Vancouver, Flinders, Bass&mdash;all these are familiar to the world, and
    there are others in plenty; for example, Grant, who in his vessel, the brig <i>Lady
    Nelson</i>, did such work in Australian waters as, if performed nowadays
    say in Africa, would have been recorded in hundreds of newspaper interviews,
    many process-work pictures and a 21s. book with cheap editions!</p>
  <p>What a story is that of Bass and Flinders! Such noble, disinterested courage!
    Such splendid service to English colonisation, and such a sad ending to it
    all.</p>
  <p>Bass and Flinders, in their tiny open boat, the <i>Tom Thumb</i>, and in
    the sloop <i>Norfolk</i>, dotting the blank map of Australia with the names
    of their discoveries&mdash;it is not necessary surely to remind the reader
    that Bass began, and together the two men completed, the discovery and passage
    of the straits between Van Dieman&rsquo;s Land and the main continent. Bass
    surveyed something like six hundred miles of the Australian coast in a whaleboat
    with a crew of six men! And one <i>cannot</i> summarise Flinders&rsquo; work
    in the <i>Norfolk</i> and in the <i>Investigator</i> before the old ship
    was condemned and converted into a hulk to rot in Sydney Harbour.</p>
  <p>How were these men rewarded for their services, and what has posterity done
    to keep their names in remembrance? In 1803 Flinders started for England,
    was wrecked, and making his way to the Mauritius was there, to the everlasting
    disgrace of Napoleon&rsquo;s Island governor, detained a prisoner for more
    than six years. Of course the English Government ultimately procured his
    release, but it took them all that time to do it; and when he did get back
    they promoted his juniors over his head. When he died in 1814, a broken heart
    was as much as anything else the cause of his death.</p>
  <p>Bass, after leaving Australia, went to England and sailed in an armed merchantman
    bound to South America. At Valparaiso the Governor of the town refused to
    allow the vessel to trade. Bass, who was then in command of the ship, threatened
    to bombard the town, and the refusal was withdrawn; but, watching their opportunity
    the authorities seized him when he was off his guard, and it was supposed
    he was sent to the interior. As the years passed by there were one or two
    reports that he was seen working in the mines, but it seems to have been
    no one&rsquo;s business to inquire into his fate. It is more than probable
    that the brave Bass died a slave.</p>
  <p>But the whalers, &ldquo;South Seamen&rdquo; and East Indiamen, did no less
    good service than the King&rsquo;s ships in the early days, and yet even
    the old books do them but scant justice. For the first fifty years of Australian
    colonisation the merchantmen charted reefs, discovered harbours, and did
    just those things for the desert waters of the Australasian Pacific as were
    afterwards done by land explorers, in their camel and pack-horse journeyings
    into the waterless interior of the continent And the stories that could be
    told! The whalers and sealers who were cast away on desert islands, and lived
    Robinson Crusoe lives for years! The open boat voyages. The massacres by
    blacks. The cuttings-off by the savage islanders of the South Pacific. The
    mutinies and sea fights!</p>
  <p>Hobart in Tasmania, Twofold Bay in New South Wales, and many New Zealand
    ports were the great whaling stations, and Sydney the commercial headquarters.
    Fifty years ago there were something like twenty whalers in the Hobart Fleet
    alone; now, one or two hulks lying in Whaler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rotten Row&rdquo; is
    practically all that survives of the trade.</p>
  <p>The Americans took a leading part in the industry, and ships with <i>New
      Bedford</i> or <i>Nantucket</i> under their sterns traversed the Pacific
      from one end to the other. Australian whaling was begun (Dampier reported
      whales as early as 1699) in Governor Phillip&rsquo;s time, by some of the
      convict transports coming out with whaling equipment in their holds, and
      after disembarking their human freight, departing for the &ldquo;Fisheries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some of these ships often remained in the Pacific for years, making cruises
    of twelve or eighteen months&rsquo; duration, returning to Sydney when full
    ships to discharge and refresh, their cargoes being sent to England in some
    returning &ldquo;favourite fast clipper,&rdquo; while the whalers went back
    to their greasy and dangerous vocation, until they were lost, or cut off
    by the savages, or worn out and converted into hulks.</p>
  <p>What numbers of them <i>were</i> lost! and what wonderful and blood-curdling
    experiences their crews underwent when they were castaways, or deserted,
    or were marooned on &ldquo;the islands&rdquo;! Here is a story of a vessel
    lost in Torres Straits in 1836&mdash;not a whaler, but an East Indiaman.
    Some of her crew and passengers managed to land on the mainland of North
    Australia and were there captured by blacks. Six months later a few survivors
    were rescued and landed in Sydney; and this is what had happened to the only
    woman of the party, Mrs. Fraser, wife of the captain: She had seen her child
    die, her husband speared to death before her face, the chief mate roasted
    alive, the second mate burned over a slow fire until he was too crippled
    to walk, and otherwise horribly and indescribably tortured, and she herself
    was made to climb trees for honey for her captors by having lighted gum branches
    applied to her body.</p>
  <p>In another instance a vessel was wrecked on the North Australian coast in
    1846, and nearly twenty years later the sole survivor turned up at a cattle
    station near Port Denison, in North Queensland. He had been all this time
    living among the blacks, unable to escape, and civilisation had found its
    way, in the years that had elapsed, far enough into the back country to reach
    him. The stockman who first saw the man took him for a black and levelled
    his rifle at him, when he was stopped from shooting the poor fellow by the
    words, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire, I am an Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here, told in a few words, is the story of the first landing in Victoria,
    and the first discovery of coal in New South Wales: On the map of Tasmania,
    in the north-east corner, is marked the Furneaux Group of islands in Bass&rsquo;s
    Straits. Dotted about the cluster are such names as Preservation Island,
    Clarke Island, and Armstrong Channel. These names all commemorate the wreck
    of the <i>Sydney Cove</i>, Captain Hamilton, bound from Calcutta to Sydney,
    and lost in February, 1797. She sprang a leak on the 13th of December, 1796,
    and her crew, chiefly Lascars, managed to keep her afloat till the 9th of
    the following February, when the skipper made Preservation Island, and there
    beached her. All the people landed safely, and got what stores they could
    ashore. Then it was decided to despatch the long boat to Port Jackson for
    help.</p>
  <p>Thompson the mate, Clarke the supercargo, three European seamen, and a dozen
    Lascars manned the boat and left the island on the 29th of February. On the
    1st of March the boat was driven ashore and battered to pieces close to Cape
    Howe (near the present boundary line of Victoria and New South Wales) three
    hundred miles from Sydney, in a country never before trodden by the feet
    of white men. All hands were saved, and after a fortnight&rsquo;s rest, feeding
    on such shellfish as they could obtain, the party set out to walk to Sydney.</p>
  <p>Clarke kept a rough diary of this journey, telling of encounters with blacks,
    of death and madness by starvation and other privations; of how they crossed
    wide and shark-infested rivers by building rafts of tree branches cut down
    and fashioned with jack knives; of how the lives of men were purchased from
    the blacks by strips of clothing; and of how they counted the buttons on
    their ragged garments, and thus reckoned how many lives could be bought from
    the savages with what remained.</p>
  <p>The terrible march lasted until the 15th of May; then three exhausted men,
    horrible to look upon, and the only survivors of seventeen who had, sixty
    days before, begun the journey, were picked up a few miles to the south of
    Sydney by a fishing boat.</p>
  <p>The spot where they were seen walking along the beach was close to Port
    Hacking, and Clarke, three days before his rescue, had lit a fire and cooked
    some fish with coal he picked up. This was the first discovery of the great
    southern coal-fields of New South Wales.</p>
  <p>There are other less gruesome stories than these; for example that of the
    Sydney whaler <i>Policy</i>, which, sailing under a Letter of Marque for
    the Moluccas, was set upon by a Dutch private ship of war&mdash;the <i>Swift</i>&mdash;at
    one time a formidable and successful French privateer. Captain Foster of
    the <i>Policy</i>, though his armament was very inferior and many of his
    crew were prostrated with fever, engaged the Dutchman, fought him for some
    hours, and brought his ship a prize into Sydney Harbour. Two Spanish vessels
    were captured in the same way by armed Sydney whalers; so that Australian
    waters have seen a little fighting.</p>
  <p>On board the convict ships of those early days there were often mutinies,
    desperate and sometimes bloody, and some of these led to remarkable results.
    In one instance the soldiers&mdash;not the prisoners&mdash;rose upon the
    crew and the ship&rsquo;s officers, turned them adrift in an open boat, and
    carried off the ship. They were recaptured afterwards by a man-of-war in
    the Indian Ocean and brought to justice. Convict mutinies often were only
    suppressed after desperate hand-to-hand fighting; then a day or two later
    the ringleaders would be hanged from the yardarm, and a dozen or more convicts
    flogged at the gratings. And these things, be it remembered, were going on
    only an old man&rsquo;s lifetime ago.</p>
  <p>New Zealand is fertile in adventure stories, and the well-known <i>Boyd</i> massacre
    is paralleled by two or three other tragedies equally as dreadful, if less
    often told. The whaling history of that colony would make a book&mdash;not
    of the kind suitable for young ladies seminaries, &rsquo;tis true, but mighty
    strong in human interest, and presenting the race as well as the sex problem
    for the study of the reader.</p>
  <p>Statistics are terribly dry reading, but by way of contrasting the condition
    of Australian shipping then and now, it is worth while quoting a few figures.</p>
  <p>In 1835, the heyday of the colonial whaling trade, when the smoky glare
    of the whaleships&rsquo; try-works lit up the darkness of the Pacific ocean
    night, there were forty-one vessels, of a total tonnage of 9,257 tons, registered
    in New South Wales, employed in the fishery. In the same year twenty-two
    vessels arrived in Sydney from the various grounds, their cargoes of whalebone,
    sealskins, and sperm and black oil valuing altogether about  &pound;150,000.
    Now the whaling trade in Southern Seas is represented by two or three small
    and poorly equipped ships from Hobart, though the whales&mdash;sperm, right,
    and humpback&mdash;are again as plentiful as they were in the first years
    of the fishery. One of the present writers, less than four years ago, counted
    over three hundred humpbacks passing to the northward in two days on the
    coast of New South Wales, while there were ten times that number of the swift
    and dangerous &ldquo;fin-back&rdquo; whales travelling with them.</p>
  <p>But, though the whale fishery is extinct, there is something to be shown
    instead.</p>
  <p>It has been said that twenty-two whalers entered Sydney in 1835, which means
    that during that year not twice that number of vessels of all descriptions
    entered the port&mdash;for the whaling was then <i>the</i> trade. But the
    steamer was beginning to count, and the beginning of the Sydney steam trade
    is not without a peculiar interest&mdash;for Londoners at any rate.</p>
  <p>The <i>Sophia Jane</i> was the first steamer in Australasian waters. She
    arrived in Sydney from London, <i>via</i> the Cape of Good Hope, with cargo
    and passengers, on the 14th of May. This vessel was built on the Thames by
    a well-known shipbuilder of the time, William Evans, who was the builder
    of many other notable early steamers. She was running for a summer or two
    as a passenger steamer between Gravesend and London; then between different
    ports in the south of England; and then, under a Lieutenant Biddulph, of
    the Royal Navy, she was sent to Sydney. The little vessel was 126 feet long
    by 20 feet beam, drew 6 feet of water, was of 256 tons burden, and had accommodation
    for fifty-four passengers; her engines were of 50 horse-power, and her speed
    eight knots an hour. This was the first steamer in the Southern Seas&mdash;the
    forerunner of a fleet of mighty leviathans.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out on the wastes of the Never Never&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s where the dead men lie!<br>
There where the heat-waves dance for ever&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s where the dead men lie!&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Barcroft Boake,<i> </i>in
  the <i>Sydney Bulletin.)</i></p>
  <p align="center"><b>I</b></p>
  <p>Jack Barrington, nominal owner of Tinandra Downs cattle station on the Gilbert
    River in the far north of North Queensland, was riding slowly over his run,
    when, as the fierce rays of a blazing sun, set in a sky of brass, smote upon
    his head and shoulders and his labouring stock-horse plodded wearily homewards
    over the spongy, sandy soil, the lines of Barcroft Boake came to his mind,
    and, after he had repeated them mentally, he cursed aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;<i>That&rsquo;s where the dead men lie!</i>&rdquo; Poor Boake
    must have thought of this God-forsaken part of an utterly God-forsaken country,
    I think, when he wrote &lsquo;Out where the Dead Men Lie.&rsquo; For I believe
    that God Almighty has forgotten it! Oh for rain, rain, rain! Rain to send
    the Gilbert down in a howling yellow flood, and turn this blarsted spinifex
    waste of scorching sand and desolation into green grass&mdash;and save me
    and the youngsters from giving it best, and going under altogether.... Boake
    knew this cursed country well.... I wonder if he ever &lsquo;owned&rsquo; a
    station&mdash;one with a raging drought, a thundering mortgage, and a worrying
    and greedy bank sooling him on to commit suicide, or else provide rain as
    side issues.... I don&rsquo;t suppose he had a wife and children to leave
    to the mercy of the Australian Pastoralists&rsquo; Bank. D&mdash;n
    and curse the Australian Pastoralists&rsquo;  Bank, and the drought, and
    this scorching sand and hateful spinifex&mdash;and God help the poor cattle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew rein almost under the shade of a clump of stunted sandalwood, which
    had, in good seasons, been a favourite mustering camp, and looked about him,
    and then he passed his hand over his eyes to shut out for a few moments the
    melancholy spectacle before him.</p>
  <p>I have said that he pulled up &ldquo;almost&rdquo; under shelter; further
    he could not advance, for the hard, parched ground immediately under the
    shade of the sandalwoods was thickly covered by the stiffened sun-dried carcasses
    of some hundreds of dead cattle, which, having become too weak to leave the
    sheltering trees in search of food and water had lain down and died. Beyond,
    scattered singly and about in twos and threes, were the remains of scores
    of other wretched beasts, which, unable to drag themselves either to the
    sandy river-bed or to the scanty shade of the stunted timber, had perished
    where they fell.</p>
  <p>With a heavy sigh Harrington dismounted, took off his water-bag from the
    saddle, and pouring a little water into his hat, gave his horse a drink.
    Then he drank a few mouthfuls himself, filled and lit his pipe, and sat down,
    to rest awhile until the sun had lost its fierce intensity&mdash;and think.</p>
  <p>And he thought despairingly of the black prospect which for the past six
    or seven months had tormented him by day, and haunted him at night, broken
    now and then with a gleam of hope when the pitiless blue of the sky changed
    to grey, and rain seemed near, only to be followed by renewed and bitter
    disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It cannot last much longer,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;even if rain
    came within a week the rest of the poor brutes left alive will be too weak
    to recover&mdash;and there&rsquo;s not hands enough on the station to cut
    leaves for them. Even the blacks have cleared out lower down the river...
    found a good water-hole I daresay, and, like wise niggers, are camping there.
    Why doesn&rsquo;t Providence give a poor honest bullock as much show for
    his life in a drought as a damned, filthy blackfellow! Instead of hoofs&mdash;in
    this part of the country at any rate&mdash;cattle ought to have feet like
    a bandicoot, then the poor beasts could worry along by digging waterholes
    in the river bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, sick at heart as he was, a faint smile flitted over his sun-bronzed
    face at the fancy.</p>
  <p>An hour passed, and Harrington, with another weary sigh, rose and saddled
    his horse&mdash;one of the few now remaining to him and able to carry a rider.
    Five miles away from the sandalwood camp was another and larger patch of
    timber&mdash;tall, slender brigalows, which grew on the edge of a dried-up
    swamp, once the haunt and breeding place of countless thousands of wild duck,
    teal, and geese. This was another of the mustering camps on Tinandra, and
    as it lay on his way home, he decided to go there and see if any of the &ldquo;Big
    Swamp&rdquo;  cattle were still alive. As he rode slowly over towards the
    fringe of timber, the westering sun turned from a dazzling, blinding gold
    to a gradually deepening red; and his sweating horse gave a snort of satisfaction
    as the soft, spongy, and sandy spinifex country was left behind, and the
    creature&rsquo;s hoofs struck upon the hard sun-baked plain of yellow earth
    which lay between the two camps. Looking down at the great, widely spreading
    cracks in the hungry soil, the result of a seven-months&rsquo; continuous
    drought, Harrington almost unconsciously bent his head and thought that surely
    God would send rain. He was not a religious man in the conventional sense&mdash;he
    had never been inside a church in his life&mdash;but the memory of his dead
    mother&rsquo;s belief in God&rsquo;s mercy and goodness was still strong
    within him.</p>
  <p>The brigalow scrub was about half a mile in length, and stood between the
    swamp and the high river bank. At the dried-up bed of the swamp itself he
    did not care to look a second time; its once reedy margin was now a sight
    of horror, for many hundreds of cattle had been bogged there long months
    before, as they had striven to get further out to the centre where there
    was yet left a little water, saved from evaporation by the broad leaves of
    the blue water-lilies.</p>
  <p>Skirting the inner edge of the scrub till he reached its centre, he looked
    carefully among the timber, but not a beast was to be seen; then dismounting
    he led his horse through, came out upon the river bank, and looked across
    the wide expanse of almost burning sand which stretched from bank to bank,
    unbroken in its desolation except by a few ti-trees whose roots, deep down,
    kept them alive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob, old fellow,&rdquo; he said to his horse, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    another ten miles to go, and there&rsquo;s no use in killing ourselves. I
    think that we can put in half an hour digging sand, and manage to raise a
    drink down there in the river bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still leading the animal, which seemed to know his master&rsquo;s intention,
    Harrington walked down the sloping bank, his long riding-boots sinking deeply
    into the fine, sandy soil, and Bob pricked up his ears and gave a true stock-horse
    sigh of weariness and anticipation combined.</p>
  <p>On the opposite side of the river bed and close under the bank were growing
    two or three heavy ti-trees, and here, just as the sun had set, he halted,
    again unsaddled, and after lighting a fire, began to scoop out a hole with
    his quart pot in between the roots of the trees. For some minutes he worked
    on with energy, then he stopped and listened, and Bob, too, turned his head
    inquiringly, for he also had heard the sound&mdash;it was only the cry of
    a beast, but it seemed so near that Harrington ceased his digging and stood
    up to look.</p>
  <p>Not a hundred yards distant he saw, by the light of the now brightly blazing
    fire, four gaunt steers and a skeleton heifer, staggering and swaying over
    the river sand towards him in their weakness and agony of hunger and thirst
    The poor creatures had seen the man and the horse! As they toiled towards
    the light of the fire, a dreadful, wheezing moan came from the parched throat
    of the leading steer as it laboured pantingly over to something human&mdash;something
    it associated with water, and grass, and life, and presently the wretched
    animal, with one last effort, fell in its tracks almost at Harrington&rsquo;s
    feet. It lay there quiet enough for a minute or two, with lean, outstretched
    neck and one horn buried in the sand, its fast glazing eye turned to the
    man, and seeming to say, &ldquo;Give me water or death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington, wrought up and excited to the last pitch, flung himself upon
    his knees, and placed his cheek against that of the dying steer, and a sob
    burst from his bosom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O God, if there is a God! have mercy upon these Thy dumb creatures
    who suffer such agony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stepped up to his horse, took his revolver out of the pouch, and then
    a merciful bullet ended the sufferings of the thirst-stricken animal at his
    feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steady, Bob, old man! Steady there!&rdquo; he said brokenly, &ldquo;I
    may have to do the same to you before long.&rdquo; And then, tearing off
    a long piece of dried ti-tree bark from one of the trees, he thrust it into
    the fire. Then, with the blazing torch in his left hand, and his pistol in
    his right, he tramped over the sand to the remaining cattle, and shot them
    dead one by one.</p>
  <p>Then back to his digging again. A drink of thick, muddy water for his horse,
    and then with a dull sense of misery in his heart he led Bob up the bank
    and began the last stage of his ride home&mdash;home to his anaemic, complaining,
    shallow-brained wife and the weakly children who, instead of being the consolation
    of his life in his misfortunes, were an added and ever-present source of
    misery and despair.</p>

<p align="center"><b>II</b></p>
  <p>A few years before, Harrington had bought Tinandra Downs, and had stocked
    the run with three thousand head of store cattle; for half of which number
    he had paid, the remainder he had bought on long terms from a neighbouring
    squatter&mdash;a man who knew his sterling merits, and was confident that
    he (Harrington) would make Tinandra one of the best cattle stations in the
    far north. Fortune had smiled upon him from the first; for within two years
    came the discovery of the famous Palmer River goldfields, only a few hundred
    miles distant, and cattle and station properties doubled in value, for in
    less than half a year there were six thousand diggers on the field, and more
    came pouring in from the southern colonies by every steamer to Cooktown.
    New townships sprang suddenly into existence, provisions of all kinds brought
    an enormous price, and Harrington cleared off his debt to his squatter friend
    almost ere he could realise having done so, and that he had several thousands
    of pounds to the good as well. And his good luck stuck to him, for it was
    attended by careful management, and every mob of fat cattle he despatched
    to the goldfield instead of sending them on a three-hundred league journey
    to Brisbane, meant another couple of thousand sovereigns.</p>
  <p>Then he began to improve the head station&mdash;and to think of Myra, a
    girl whom he had once met in Sydney, and who sent him newspapers, and, once
    or twice, at long intervals, had written him letters. He had answered these
    letters with a secret hope that, if all went well with him, he would take
    another trip to Sydney, and then&mdash;well, he could at least ask her. If
    she said no, why, who was there to chaff him? He was not a communicative
    man, had very few intimate men friends, and the few women whom he knew were
    not the sort he could possibly talk to about a lady. Both his parents had
    died before he was ten years of age, leaving him utterly alone in the world.
    Born in a bush town, in the interior of New South Wales, he had turned to
    the bush and to the wide, open, grassy plains, as an infant would have turned
    to its mother in its distress; and the bush and the plains and the grey mountain
    ranges had taken him to their bosoms; and the silent, reserved boy became
    the resolute, hardy bushman, stock-rider, and then miner&mdash;a man fit
    and ready to meet the emergencies of his rough life. Of the outside world
    he was as ignorant as a child, as indeed were most of the men with whom for
    many years he had associated. But there was nothing despicable in his ignorance;
    and when as time went on, and his improved circumstances threw him in contact
    with men and women of refinement and culture, he was quick to take advantage
    of such opportunities; but the honest, simple nature of the man always remained
    the same.</p>
  <p>Before he was thirty, Harrington was known as one of the most experienced
    and fortunate over-lander drovers in Australia, and he became as familiar
    with the long and lonely stock-route from the stations on the Gulf of Carpentaria
    to Sydney and Melbourne, in his many journeys, as if it were a main road
    in an English county.</p>
  <p>At the conclusion of one of these tedious drives of seven months&rsquo;  duration,
    the brown-faced, quiet drover was asked by an acquaintance with whom he had
    business transactions, to spend the evening with him at his house. He went,
    and there met Myra Lyndon. He was attracted by her bright manner and smiling
    face, and when she questioned him about his life in the Far North, his adventures
    among the blacks, and the many perils of a drover&rsquo;s existence, he thought
    her the fairest and sweetest woman in the world. And Miss Myra Lyndon encouraged
    him in his admiration. Not that she cared for him in the least She had not
    reached eight-and-twenty years of age to throw herself away on a man who
    had no other ambition than to become a squatter and live amongst a lot of  &ldquo;horrid
    bellowing cattle.&rdquo; But he was nice to talk to, though terribly stupid
    about some things, and so she did not mind writing to him once or twice&mdash;it
    would reward him for the horse he had one day sent to her father with a lamely
    worded note, saying that it was one of a mob he had just bought at the saleyards,
    and as he had no use for a lady&rsquo;s hack, he thought that perhaps Miss
    Lyndon would be so kind as to accept it Mr. Lyndon smiled as he read the
    note, he knew that drovers did not usually buy ladies&rsquo; hacks; but being
    a man harassed to death with an expensive family, he was not disposed to
    discourage Harrington&rsquo;s attentions to Myra; though, having a conscience,
    he felt that Jack Harrington was too good a man for such a useless, empty-brained,
    and selfish creature as his eldest daughter.</p>
  <p>So Harrington went back to his &ldquo;bellowing bullocks,&rdquo; and then,
    having saved enough money, bought the very run he had so often wished he
    could buy; and &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Harrington, the overlander, became &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; John
    Harrington, the pastoralist and owner of Tinandra Downs, and then the vision
    of Myra Lyndon&rsquo;s face came to him very often&mdash;now that he was
    so prosperous.</p>
  <p>One day he told his overseer that he was going to Sydney for a trip, and
    being a man of action, packed his valise, mounted his horse, and rode off
    on his journey of five hundred miles to the nearest seaport where he could
    take passage for Sydney.</p>
  <p>For the first week or so after his arrival in the city, he  &ldquo;mooned&rdquo; about
    doing nothing, and trying to pluck up courage enough to go to Myra Lyndon
    to ask her to be his wife. He had called several times upon her father and
    discussed business matters with him; but beyond inquiring after  &ldquo;Mrs.
    Lyndon and the Misses Lyndon,&rdquo; had said nothing further, and in a nervous,
    shamefaced manner had each time accepted Mr. Lyndon&rsquo;s invitation to  &ldquo;come
    and see the girls before he went back to the North,&rdquo; but had not had
    the courage to go. Next week, or the week after that, would do, he thought.
    If she said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he wouldn&rsquo;t feel it so much&mdash;once
    he was on his way North again in the old <i>Florence Irving</i>; he would
    put it off till just as he was ready to start. Then if she said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
    would stay in Sydney as long as his love wished&mdash;a month&mdash;aye,
    six months, so long as she came back with him to Tinandra Downs. And Myra
    Lyndon, who knew from her father that her &ldquo;bullock-driver admirer,&rdquo; as
    she had mockingly called him to her friends, was in Sydney, waited for him
    impatiently. A systematic course of jilting and being jilted had made her
    feel anxious as to her future, and gall and wormwood had come to her now
    that her two younger sisters had married before her, and left her, as her
    somewhat acidulous-tongued mother said, &ldquo;the Lyndon family wallflower.&rdquo; She
    meant to marry him, spend a year or so among the &ldquo;beastly bellowing
    cattle,&rdquo;  and then return to Sydney, where as Mrs. Harrington, the
    wealthy squatter&rsquo;s wife, she could enjoy herself thoroughly, snub some
    of the women she hated, and flirt with some of the men she liked.</p>
  <p>Late one night, Harrington, sauntering from the theatre to his hotel, met,
    to his intense astonishment, a man he knew&mdash;had known years before when
    he (Harrington) was a drover and the other man&mdash;Walters&mdash;was a
    mounted trooper in the Queensland police.</p>
  <p>They shook hands warmly, and then Walters said, &ldquo;Come along with me,
    Jack, to the Water Police Station; we can have a yarn there.... Oh, yes,
    I&rsquo;m a Sydney man now&mdash;a full-fledged inspector of police... tell
    you all about it by and by. But, push along, old man. One of my men has just
    told me that a woman who jumped off the Circular Quay and tried to drown
    herself, is lying at the station, and is not expected to pull through. Hallo!
    here&rsquo;s a cab! Jump in, Jack; there&rsquo;s some whisky in the sergeant&rsquo;s
    room, and after I&rsquo;ve seen the cadaver&mdash;if she has cadavered&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
    have a right down good yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cab rattled through the now almost deserted street, and in a few minutes
    Harrington and his friend alighted at a small stone building overlooking
    the waters of Sydney Harbour. A water-policeman, who stood at the door under
    the big gas-lamp, saluted the inspector and then showed Harrington into the
    sergeant&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes passed, and then Walters, accompanied by a big, stout, red-faced
    man, came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, here you are, old man. Jack, Dr. Parsons&mdash;the man who does
    the resuscitating and such silly business of this institution; Parsons, my
    old friend, Jack Harrington. Sergeant, where is that whisky?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is the woman dead, doctor?&rdquo; asked Harrington presently, as
    the sergeant&rsquo;s wife brought in a bottle of whisky and some glasses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the police doctor slowly, as he poured some whisky
    into his glass, &ldquo;she is not dead; but she may not live much longer&mdash;a
    day or so perhaps. It all depends. Shock to the system.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the usual sort, Parsons, I suppose?&rdquo; inquired Walters&mdash;&ldquo;left
    the baby on the wharf, with a written request for some &lsquo;kind Christian
    to love it,&rsquo; eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The fat doctor grunted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a beast, Walters. There&rsquo;s
    no baby in the case. Here, give me ten shillings&mdash;you&rsquo;ll spend
    more than that in drinks before you go to bed to-night This girl <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> one
    of the usual sort. She&rsquo;s a lady&mdash;and she&rsquo;s been starving.
    So ante-up, you ex-nigger-shooting Queensland policeman; and I&rsquo;ll add
    another half-sov. Then perhaps your friend will give me something for her.
    And I&rsquo;m not going to send her off to the hospital. I&rsquo;m going
    to take her to some people I know, and ask them to keep her for a few days
    until she gets round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington put his hand in his pocket, and then in a nervous, diffident
    way, looking first at Walters and then at the doctor, put five sovereigns
    on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty flush now, you know.... I&rsquo;m not a plunger,
    but I shall be glad, doctor, if you will take that and give it to her....
    I was almost starving myself once&mdash;-<i>you</i> know, Walters, when I
    got the sack from the &lsquo;Morning Star&rsquo; Mine for plugging the English
    manager when he called me a &lsquo;damned colonial lout.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The fat-faced doctor looked steadily at him for a moment or two. Then he
    reached out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good fellow, Mr. Harrington. I&rsquo;ll take a sovereign
    or two. Come in here with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>III</b></p>
  <p>Harrington followed him into an adjoining room, where, upon a wicker-work
    couch was reclining the figure of a young girl. Standing beside her was the
    police-sergeant&rsquo;s wife, who, as soon as the two men came in, quietly
    drew aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, here I am back again, my dear child,&rdquo; said the doctor
    good-humouredly, &ldquo;and here is a very old friend of mine, Mr. Jack Harrington;
    and we have come to cheer you up and tell you that you have two or three
    good friends. And we won&rsquo;t let any women or parsons come to you and
    worry you, and tell you that you have been a wicked girl, and ought to have
    thrown yourself upon God&rsquo;s mercy and all that sort of thing. So just
    drink that coffee, and then by and by we will take you to some people I know
    well, and you shall come and tell us in a day or two how sorry you are for
    being so foolish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s dark hazel eyes looked steadily at them both; then she
    put out a thin white hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind to me. I know it was very wicked to try and kill
    myself, but I was so lonely, and... and I had not eaten anything since Wednesday...
    and I wanted to die.&rdquo; Then she covered her face and sobbed softly,
    whilst the doctor patted her on the shoulder and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, little girl; you are in good hands now. Never
    mind Mrs. Thornton and her un-kindness. You are better away from her&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
    she, Mr. Harrington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Harrington, knowing nothing about Mrs. Thornton, promptly said  &ldquo;Oh,
    most certainly,&rdquo; and the girl&rsquo;s eyes met his for a second, and
    a faint smile flushed upon her pale lips. The tall, bearded, and brown-faced
    man&rsquo;s face seemed so full of pity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now you must go to sleep for an hour or two,&rdquo; said the doctor
    imperatively; &ldquo;so now then, little girl, &lsquo;seepy-by, beddy-bo.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
    what <i>my</i> mother used to say to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington followed the doctor out into the sergeant&rsquo;s room, where
    Inspector Walters, with his heels upon the table, was falling asleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down a moment, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; said Dr. Parsons, taking
    up a book which the sergeant had left upon the table; &ldquo;this is a sad
    case. Here is a girl, Nellie Alleyne, age 19, nursery governess to Mrs. Lavery-Thornton,
    of Waverly, jumped into the water off the Quay; rescued by Water-police Constables
    Casey and Boyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This girl has told me her story. She is alone and friendless in Sydney.
    She came out to Australia when she was seventeen, got a billet with this
    Mrs. Lavery-Thornton&mdash;who seems to be a perfect brute of a woman&mdash;suffered
    a two years&rsquo; martyrdom, and then was dismissed from her situation with
    the large sum of twenty-two shillings in her pocket Tried to get another
    such position, but people wouldn&rsquo;t take her without a recommendation
    from her last place. The Thornton woman wouldn&rsquo;t give her one; said
    she was too independent. High-spirited girl with twenty-two shillings between
    her and starvation, wanders about from one registry office to another for
    a couple of weeks, living in a room in a Miller&rsquo;s Point slum; money
    all gone; pestered by brutes in the usual way, jumps into the water to end
    her miseries. Rough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington nodded. &ldquo;Poor thing! I should like you, Dr. Parsons, to&mdash;to
    let her know that she <i>has</i> friends. Will you let me help. Fifty pounds
    or a hundred pounds won&rsquo;t hurt me... and I&rsquo;ve been stone-broke
    myself. But a man can always peg along in the bush; and it&rsquo;s an awful
    thing for a child like that to be adrift in a big city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The kind-hearted police doctor looked steadily into Harrington&rsquo;s face
    for a moment, then he said quietly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An awful thing indeed. But there are some good men in the world,
    Mr. Harrington, who are able and willing to save pure souls from destruction.
    You are one of them. Tom Walters and myself are both hard-up devils&mdash;we
    see a lot of misery, but can do nothing to alleviate it; a few shillings
    is all we can give.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington rose, and his sun-tanned face flushed as he drew out his cheque-book. &ldquo;I
    never try to shove myself in, in such matters as these, doctor, but I should
    feel pleased if you will let me help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he wrote out a cheque for fifty pounds, pushed it over to the doctor,
    said he thought it was getting late, and that he had better get back to his
    hotel.</p>
  <p>Dr. Parsons gave the sleeping inspector a shake, and in a few words told
    him what Harrington had done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dashed fool, old man,&rdquo; said Walters sleepily
    to Harrington; &ldquo;most likely she&rsquo;ll blue your fifty quid, and
    then blackmail&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor&rsquo;s hand descended upon the inspector&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Shut
    up, you beastly old wretch&mdash;do you think <i>all</i> women are alike.
    Come, now, let us have another nip and get away. Mr. Harrington is tired.
    Sergeant!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sergeant came to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thompson, take good care of that young <i>lady</i>. We happen to
    know her. If she awakes before eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, tell her
    that she is to stay with your wife till I come to see her at nine o&rsquo;clock.
    Any effects, sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and the sergeant took out his note-book, &ldquo;seven
    pawn tickets, five pennies, and a New Testament with &lsquo;Nellie Alleyne&rsquo; written
    inside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, give me those tickets, I&rsquo;ll take care of them; and Thompson,
    if the newspaper fellows come here to-night, say that the young lady fell
    over the wharf accidentally, and has gone home to her friends. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see, sir,&rdquo; said Thompson, as the good-hearted doctor slipped
    half a sovereign into his hand.</p>
  <p>Then the three men stepped out into the street and strolled up to the Royal
    Hotel, and sat down in the smoking-room, which was filled with a noisy crowd,
    some of whom soon saw Walters and called him away, leaving the doctor and
    Harrington by themselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better take this back, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; and Dr. Parsons handed
    him his cheque. &ldquo;Two or three pounds will be quite enough for the poor
    girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Harrington with a smile, &ldquo;fifty pounds won&rsquo;t
    ruin me, as I said&mdash;and it may mean a lot to her, poor child. And I
    feel glad that I can help some one... some one who is all right, you know.
    Now I must be off. Good night, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Parsons looked at the tall manly figure as he pushed his way through the
    noisy crowd in the smoking-room, and then at the cheque in his hand. &ldquo;Well,
    there&rsquo;s a good fellow. Single man, I&rsquo;ll bet; else he wouldn&rsquo;t
    be so good to a poor little devil of a stranded girl. Didn&rsquo;t even ask
    her name. May the Lord send him a good wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Lord did not send Harrington a good wife; for the very next day he called
    upon Mrs. Lyndon, and Mrs. Lyndon took good care that he should be left alone
    with Myra; and Myra smiled so sweetly at him, when with outstretched hands
    she came into the drawing-room, that he fatuously believed she loved him.
    And she of course, when he asked her to be his wife, hid her face on his
    shoulder, and said she could not understand why he could love <i>her</i>.
    Why, she was quite an old maid! Amy and Gwen were ever so much prettier than
    she, and she was sure that both Gwen and Amy, even though they were now both
    married, would feel jealous when they knew that big, handsome Jack Harrington
    had asked her to be his wife; and so on and so forth, as only the skilled
    woman of thirty, whose hopes of marriage are slipping by, knows how to talk
    and lie to an &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; man unused to women&rsquo;s ways. And
    Harrington kissed Myra&rsquo;s somewhat thin lips, and said&mdash;and believed&mdash;that
    he was the happiest man in Australia. Then Mrs. Lyndon came in, and, in the
    manner of mothers who are bursting with joy at getting rid of a daughter
    whose matrimonial prospects are looking gloomy, metaphorically fell upon
    Harrington&rsquo;s neck and wept down his back, and said he was robbing her
    of her dearest treasure, &amp;c., &amp;c. Harrington, knowing nothing of
    conventional women&rsquo;s ways, believed her, and married, for him, the
    most unsuitable woman in the world.</p>
  <p>A week or so after his marriage he received a letter from Dr. Parsons enclosing
    the cheque he had given him for Nellie Alleyne:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Harrington,&mdash;Girl won&rsquo;t take the cheque. Has a billet&mdash;cashier
    in a restaurant. Says she is writing to you. She&rsquo;s true gold. You ought
    to marry her and take her away with you to your outlandish parts. Would ask
    her to marry me&mdash;if I could keep her; but she wouldn&rsquo;t have me
    whilst you are about. Always glad to see you at my diggings; whisky and soda
    and such, and a hearty welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And by the same post came a letter from the girl herself&mdash;a letter
    that, simply worded as it was, sent an honest glow through his heart:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Mr. Harrington,&mdash;I shall never, never forget your kindness
    to me; as long as I live I shall never forget Dr. Parsons tells me that you
    live in Queensland&mdash;more than a thousand miles from Sydney, and that
    you are going away soon. Please will you let me call on you before you go
    away? I shall be so unhappy if I do not see you again, because in a letter
    I cannot tell you how I thank you, how deeply grateful I am to you for your
    goodness and generosity to me.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yours very sincerely,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Helen
Alleyne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington showed the letter to Myra, who bubbled over with pretty expressions
    of sympathy and wrote and asked her to call. Nellie did call, and the result
    of her visit was that when Harrington took his newly married wife to Tinandra
    Downs, she went with her as companion. And from the day that she entered
    the door of his house, Helen Alleyne had proved herself to be, as Dr. Parsons
    had said, &ldquo;true gold.&rdquo; As the first bright years of prosperity
    vanished, and the drought and financial worries all but crushed Harrington
    under the weight of his misfortunes, and his complaining, irritable wife
    rendered his existence at home almost unbearable, her brave spirit kept his
    from sinking under the incessant strain of his anxieties. Mrs. Harrington,
    after her third child was born, had given up even the semblance of attending
    to the children, and left them to Nellie and the servants. She was doing
    quite enough, she once told her husband bitterly, in staying with him at
    such a horrible place in such a horrible country. But she nevertheless always
    went away to the sea-coast during the hottest months, and succeeded in having
    a considerable amount of enjoyment, leaving the children and Jack and Miss
    Alleyne to swelter through the summer at Tinandra Downs as best they could.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>IV</b></p>
  <p>It was nearly midnight as Harrington took down the slip-rails and led his
    horse through the paddock up to the house, which, except for a dimly burning
    lamp in the dining-room, was in darkness. The atmosphere was close and sultry,
    and the perspiration ran down his skin in streams as he gave his horse to
    the head-stockman, who was sitting on the verandah awaiting him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terrible night, sir, but I&rsquo;m thinking if it keeps on like this
    for another hour or two we&rsquo;ll get a big thunderstorm. &lsquo;Sugar-bag&rsquo;&rdquo; (one
    of the black boys) &ldquo;was here just now and says that the ant-heaps about
    are covered with ants&mdash;that&rsquo;s a sure sign, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God send it so, Banks! If no rain comes within two days, you&rsquo;ll
    have to start away for Cleveland Bay with Mrs. Harrington and Miss Alleyne
    and the children. We must find horses somehow to take them there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before Banks led the horse away for a drink, he stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Alleyne went to Canton Reef, sir, this morning with little Sandy.
    She ought to have been here before dark, but I expect the horses knocked
    up. There&rsquo;s a couple of cows with young calves there, so Sandy says,
    and Miss Alleyne said she would try and bring them in if I would let her
    take Sandy. We&rsquo;ve had no milk, sir, for the children since Tuesday,
    and Miss Alleyne said that you would be vexed. I would have gone myself,
    sir, but I couldn&rsquo;t well leave, and I know Miss Alleyne will manage&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    only fifteen miles, and Sandy says that the two cows and calves are pretty
    fat and can travel; there&rsquo;s a bit of feed at those waterholes about
    the Canton. Most likely she and the little black boy have yarded the cows
    at the Seven-mile Hut and are camping there for the night But I&rsquo;ll
    start off now, sir. I&rsquo;ve got Peter the Pig already saddled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Banks, certainly. Why didn&rsquo;t you start long ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Harrington said I must wait for you, sir,&rdquo; the man answered
    somewhat sullenly.</p>
  <p>Harrington nodded. &ldquo;Hurry up, Banks; but here, take a glass of grog
    first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He watched the stockman disappear down the dusty track to the slip-rails,
    then he went inside, and sitting down at the table buried his face in his
    hands. Then, booted and dusty, and tired in mind and body, he slept.</p>
  <p>An hour had passed, and no sound disturbed the hot oppressive silence of
    the night but the heavy breathing of the wearied man. Then through his dreamless
    slumber came the murmur of voices, and presently three figures walked quickly
    up from the milking-yard towards the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep, miss,&rdquo; whispered Banks, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
    dog tired But the news you have got for him will put fresh life into him.
    Now just you go to him, miss, and tell him, and then as soon as I have given
    them cows a drink, I&rsquo;ll bring you in some tea. Sandy, you little black
    devil, light a fire in the kitchen and don&rsquo;t make a noise, or I&rsquo;ll
    tan your hide, honest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a minute or so the girl stood in the doorway of the dining-room, holding
    a heavy saddle-pouch, in her hand, her frame trembling with emotion and physical
    exhaustion; and trying to speak. As soon as she could speak, she walked over
    to the sleeping man and touched him on the shoulder He awoke with a start
    just as she sank on her knees, and leaning her elbows on a chair beside him,
    burst into a fit of hysterical weeping. He waited for her to recover herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad, so glad, Mr. Harrington! Now you need not give
    up Tinandra... and the drought doesn&rsquo;t matter... and oh, I thank God
    for His goodness that He has let me help you at last!&rdquo; She broke off
    with a choking sob, and then, with streaming eyes, placed her hand in his.</p>
  <p>Harrington lifted her up and placed her on a couch. &ldquo;Lie there, Miss
    Alleyne. I will call Mrs. Harrington&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She put out her hand beseechingly. &ldquo;Please <i>don&rsquo;t</i>, Mr.
    Harrington. She is not at all strong, and I think I made her very angry this
    morning by going away to look for the milkers.... But look, Mr. Harrington,
    look inside the saddle pouch.&rdquo; Then she sat up, and her eyes burnt
    with feverish expectation, &ldquo;Quick, quick, please,&rdquo; and then she
    began to laugh wildly, but clenching her hands tightly together she overcame
    her hysteria, and attempted to speak calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall be better in a minute... empty it out on the table, please...
    Banks says it is another outcrop of the old Canton Reef.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington picked up the saddle-pouch, and putting it on the table, turned
    up the lamp, and unfastened the straps; it was filled with pieces of rough
    weather-worn quartz thickly impregnated with gold. The largest piece contained
    more gold than quartz, and an involuntary cry of astonishment and admiration
    burst from his lips as he held it to the light.</p>
  <p>Nellie&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with joy. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lovely! I can&rsquo;t
    talk, my lips are so dry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington dashed outside to the verandah filled a glass from the canvas
    water-bag hanging from a beam overhead, and gave it to the exhausted girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you attempt to speak for five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, with a faint smile, as she drank
    off the cold water&mdash;and then at once began to tell him of her discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sandy and I found the two cows and calves a mile this side of the
    Canton Reef in a gully, but before we could head them off they had got away
    into the ironbark ridges. Sandy told me to wait, and galloped after them.
    I followed him to the top of the first ridge, and then pulled up, and there,
    right under my horse&rsquo;s feet I saw a small &lsquo;blow&rsquo; of quartz
    sticking up out of the baked ground, and I saw the gold in it quite plainly.
    Of course I was wildly excited, and jumped off. The stone was quite loose
    and crumbly, and I actually pulled some pieces away with my hands, and when
    I saw the thick yellow gold running all through it I sat down and cried.
    Then I became so frightened that Sandy might not find me again, for it would
    be dark in another hour, and so I ran up and down along the ridge, listening
    for the sound of his stockwhip. And then I went back towards the outcrop
    of the reef again, and half-way down I picked up that big lump&mdash;it was
    half buried in the ground.... And oh, Mr. Harrington, all that ridge is covered
    with it... I could have brought away as much again, but Sandy had no saddle-pouch...
    and I was dying to come home and tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She breathed pantingly for a few minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was nearly dark when Sandy came back. He had run the cattle on
    to a camp about three miles away.... I don&rsquo;t know which pleased me
    most, to get the cows so that poor Mable and Harry can have some milk in
    the morning, or the gold.... Banks met us half-way from the Seven-mile Hut,
    and took me off my horse and put me in front of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Banks came to the door, carrying a tray with a cup of tea and some food. &ldquo;Here
    ye are, Miss Alleyne; ye&rsquo;re a born stockman, an&rsquo; a prospector,
    an&rsquo;&mdash;God bless you, miss, <i>you&rsquo;ve brought the rain as
    well</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For as the rough, hairy-faced stockman began to speak, a low rumbling sound
    of thunder smote the silence of the night, followed by a loud appalling clap,
    and then another, and another, and presently a cooling blast of wind came
    through the open door, and stirred and shook the Venetian blinds hanging
    outside. Banks almost dropped the tea-tray, and then darting outside, dashed
    his cabbage-tree hat on the ground, and began to dance as the first heavy
    drops of the coming deluge fell upon his head.</p>
  <p>In less than ten minutes, Harrington, with silent joy in his heart, was
    standing at the doorway, watching the descending torrents of rain&mdash;that
    rain which to his bushman&rsquo;s heart meant more than all the gold which
    lay beneath the earth. He had, as it first began to fall, rushed into his
    wife&rsquo;s bedroom, and kissed her and the terrified children.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The rain has come, Myra, thank God,&rdquo; he said, and then he added
    quietly, &ldquo;I have more good news for you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Harrington said she was quite aware of the rain having come&mdash;the
    disgusting noise of the thunder had made the children scream. Had Miss Alleyne
    come back? And brought the cows? His other good news could keep till the
    morning.</p>
  <p>Harrington turned away from her with a feeling of dulled resentment. <i>He</i> knew
    what the girl had suffered, and his wife&rsquo;s heartlessness cut him to
    the quick.</p>
  <p>As he stood watching Banks and the black boys filling every available tank
    and cask on the station from the downpour off the roof, Nellie rose from
    the couch on which she had been lying, and touched his arm timidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe in God&rsquo;s goodness <i>now</i>, Mr. Harrington?
    See, He has sent the rain, and He has granted my daily prayer to Him that
    I, too, might help you. And Banks says that this is not a passing thunderstorm,
    but that the drought has broken up altogether&mdash;for see, the wind is
    from the south.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington raised her hand to his lips. &ldquo;I have always tried to believe
    in God and in His mercy, Miss Alleyne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not always, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    you remember when all the Big Swamp! mob were bogged and dying, that you
    said that if He would not hear the moans and see the agonies of the beasts
    He had created, that He would not listen to the prayers of human beings who
    were not suffering as they suffered? And to-day, as Sandy and I rode along
    to the Canton Reef, I prayed again and again, and always when I passed a
    dying beast I said, &lsquo;<i>O God! have mercy upon these Thy dumb creatures
    who suffer much agony!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington&rsquo;s chest heaved. &ldquo;And I prayed as you prayed, Miss
    Alleyne; but I said, &lsquo;<i>O God! if there is a God</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She put out her hand to him and her dark eyes filled with tears.  &ldquo;He
    has answered our prayers.... And now, good night... I wish I could go out
    into the rain; I feel I could dance for joy.... Mr. Harrington, <i>do</i> let
    me go to the Canton Reef with you to-morrow. Everything will be all right
    to-morrow, won&rsquo;t it? But there, how thoughtless I am.... I am going
    to milk those two cunning cows till they are dry; poor little Harry does
    so want some fresh milk. Good night, Mr. Harrington; I shall sleep happily
    to-night&mdash;everything will be all right to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At breakfast-time next morning the rain was still falling steadily, and
    Mrs. Harrington decided to join her husband at the morning meal.</p>
  <p>Harrington rode up to the door and smiled brightly at his wife.  &ldquo;Waiting
    for me, dear? I won&rsquo;t be long. The river is running now, Myra&mdash;running
    after two years! I&rsquo;m off to Miss Alleyne&rsquo;s reef as soon as I&rsquo;ve
    had a bit of tucker. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In bed, I presume,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harrington acidulously. &ldquo;She
    might have remembered that I was very much upset last night by that horrible
    thunder, and have risen earlier and attended to the children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A look of intense disgust came over her husband&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Myra, the girl was done-up, dead beat! Won&rsquo;t you go and see
    if she is able to get up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Harrington rose stiffly. &ldquo;Oh, certainly, if you wish it. But
    I think it is a great mistake. She really ought to have considered the children,
    and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The head stockman&rsquo;s wife met her at the door, and looking past her
    mistress, spoke to Harrington in terrified tones&mdash;-</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Alleyne is dead, sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harrington sprang from his chair. &ldquo;Dead, Mrs. Banks!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I was only just in time. She on&rsquo;y sez, &lsquo;Tell
    Mr. Harrington that I am so glad that everythink will be all right now.&rsquo; An&rsquo; then
    she smiled, sir, and sez as I was to kiss Master Harry and Miss Mabel for
    her, as she was agoin&rsquo;. And then she sez, &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t God good
    to send the rain, Mrs. Banks? Everything will be all right now for poor Mr.
    Harrington&mdash;rain and gold.&rsquo; Then she just laid quiet for a minute,
    an&rsquo; when I looked at her face again, I saw she was dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A year later, Jack Harrington, again one of the wealthiest cattle men in
    North Queensland, and the owner of one of the richest gold mines in the colony,
    was riding home to his station. Behind him he heard the clatter and clash
    of the twenty-stamper battery that on the &ldquo;Canton Ridge&rdquo; was
    pounding him in so many thousands of pounds a month; before him lay the sweeping
    grassy downs and thickly timbered creeks of a now smiling country. His wife
    and children had long before returned to the cooler South, and in his heart
    was a great loneliness. Not, perhaps, for them, but because of the memory
    of the girl whose prayer to the Almighty had been answered, and who was resting
    on the bank of the Gilbert under the shade of a big Leichhardt tree.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="JackRenton"></a>Jack Renton</h2>
  <p>Some yarns of an exceedingly tough and Munchausen-like character have been
    spun and printed by men of their adventures in Australian waters or the South
    Seas, but an examination of such stories by any one with personal knowledge
    of the Pacific and Australasia has soon, and very deservedly so, knocked
    the bottom out of a considerable number of them. Yet there are stories of
    South Sea adventure well authenticated, which  are not a whit less wonderful
    than the most marvellous falsehoods that any man has yet told, and the story
    of what befell John Renton is one of these. A file of the <i>Queenslander</i> (the
    leading Queensland weekly newspaper) for 1875 will corroborate his story;
    for that paper gave the best account of his adventures in one of their November
    (1875) numbers, and the story was copied into nearly every paper in Australasia.</p>
  <p>Like Harry Bluff, John Renton &ldquo;when a boy left his friends and his
    home, o&rsquo;er the wild ocean waves all his life for to roam.&rdquo; Renton&rsquo;s
    home was in Stromness, in the Orkneys, and he shipped on board a vessel bound
    to Sydney, in 1867, as an ordinary seaman, he then being a lad of eighteen.
    When in Sydney he got about among the boarding-houses, in sailor-town, and
    one morning woke up on the forecastle of the <i>Reynard</i> of Boston, bound
    on a cruise for guano among the South Pacific Islands.</p>
  <p>Renton had been crimped, and finding himself where he was, bothered no more
    about it, but went cheerfully to work, not altogether displeased at the prospect
    of new adventures, which would enable him to by and by go back to the old
    folks with plenty of dollars, and a stock of startling yarns to reel off.
    He was a steady, straightforward lad, though somewhat thoughtless at times,
    and resolved to be a steady, straightforward man. The vessel first called
    into the Sandwich Islands, and there shipped a gang of Hawaiian natives to
    help load the guano, then she sailed away to the southward for McKean&rsquo;s
    Island, one of the Phoenix Group, situated about lat. 3&deg; 35&rsquo; S.
    and long. 174&deg; 20&rsquo; W.</p>
  <p>On board the <i>Reynard</i> was an old salt known to all hands as &ldquo;Boston
    Ned.&rdquo; He had been a whaler in his time, had deserted, and spent some
    years beachcombing among the islands of the South Seas, and very soon, through
    his specious tongue, he had all hands wishing themselves clear of the &ldquo;old
    hooker&rdquo; and enjoying life in the islands instead of cruising about,
    hazed here and there and everywhere by the mates of the <i>Reynard</i>, whose
    main purpose in life was to knock a man down in order to make him &ldquo;sit
    up.&rdquo;  Presently three or four of the hands became infatuated with the
    idea of settling on an island, and old Ned, nothing loth, undertook to take
    charge of the party if they would make an attempt to clear from the ship.
    The old man had taken a fancy to young Renton, and the youngster, when the
    idea was imparted to him, fell in with it enthusiastically; for he was exasperated
    with the treatment he had received on board the guanoman&mdash;the afterguard
    of an American guano ship are usually a rough lot. The ship was lying on
    and off the land, there being no anchorage, and before the plan had been
    discussed more than a few hours, the men, five in all, determined to put
    it into execution.</p>
  <p>A small whaleboat was towing astern of the vessel in case the wind should
    fall light and the ship drift in too close to the shore. It was a fine night,
    with a light breeze, and there was, they thought, a good chance of getting
    to the southward, to one of the Samoan group, where they could settle, or
    by shipping on board a trading schooner they might later on strike some other
    island to their fancy.</p>
  <p>By stealth they managed to stow in the boat a couple of small breakers of
    water, holding together sixteen gallons, and the forecastle bread barge with
    biscuits enough for three meals a day per man for ten days. They managed
    also to steal four hams, and each man brought pipes, tobacco, and matches.
    A harpoon with some line, an old galley frying-pan, mast, sail and oars,
    and some blankets completed the equipment For they took no compass, though
    they made several attempts to get at one slung in the cabin, and tried at
    first to take one out of the poop binnacle; but the officer of the watch
    on deck was too wide awake for them to risk that, and the cabin compass was
    screwed to the roof close to the skipper&rsquo;s berth; and so the old man
    who was their leader, old sailor and whaler as he was, actually gave up the
    idea of taking a compass, and these people without more ado, one night slipped
    over the side into the whaleboat, cut the painter, and by daylight the boat
    was out of sight of land and of the ship. They were afloat upon the Pacific,
    running six or seven miles before a north-east breeze and expecting to sight
    land in less than a week, and were already anticipating the freedom and luxury
    of island life in store for them.</p>
  <p>Three days later it fell calm, and they had to take to the oars. The sun
    was intensely hot, the water a sheet of glass reflecting back upon them the
    ball of fire overhead. Now and again a cats-paw would ripple across the plain
    of water, but there were no clouds, there was no sight of land. They kept
    on pulling. For three, for four days&mdash;a week&mdash;for ten days&mdash;they
    tugged at the oars, except when a favouring breeze came. The water was reduced
    to a few pints, the food to a few days&rsquo; half-rations. Their limbs were
    cramped so that they could not move from their places in the boat, their
    bodies were becoming covered with sores; and the wind had now died away entirely,
    the sea was without a ripple, and for ever shone above them the fierce, relentless
    sun.</p>
  <p>Gradually it had dawned upon them that they were lost&mdash;that perhaps
    they had run past Samoa. The first eagerness of their adventure gave place
    to despair, and by degrees their despair grew to madness of a more awful
    kind.</p>
  <p>On the fifteenth day there appeared to the south and east a low, dark-grey
    cloud. &ldquo;Land at last!&rdquo;  was the unspoken thought in each man&rsquo;s
    heart as he looked at his comrade, but feared to voice his hope. And presently
    the cloud grew darker and more clearly defined, and one of the men&mdash;the
    next oldest to the author of all their miseries&mdash;fell upon his weak
    and trembling knees, and raised his hands in thankfulness and prayer to the
    Almighty. Alas! it was not land, but the ominous forerunner of the fierce
    and sweeping mid-equatorial gale which lay veiled behind. In less than half
    an hour it came upon and smote them with savage fury, and the little boat
    was running before a howling gale and a maddened, foam-whipped sea.</p>
  <p>And then it happened that, ill and suffering as he was from the agonies
    of hunger and thirst, the heroic nature of old &ldquo;Boston Ned&rdquo; came
    out, and his bold sailor&rsquo;s heart cheered and encouraged his wretched,
    despairing companions. All that night, and for the greater part of the following
    day, he stood in the stern-sheets, grasping the bending steer-oar as the
    boat swayed and surged along before the gale, and constantly watching lest
    she should broach to and smother in the roaring seas; the others lay in the
    bottom, feebly baling out the water, encouraged, urged, and driven to that
    exertion by the gallant old American seaman.</p>
  <p>Towards noon the wind moderated, in the afternoon it died away altogether,
    and again the boat lay rising and falling to the long Pacific swell, and &ldquo;Boston
    Ned&rdquo; flung his exhausted frame down in the stern-sheets and slept.</p>
  <p>Again the blood-red sun leapt from a sea of glassy smoothness&mdash;for
    the swell had subsided during the night&mdash;and again the wretched men
    looked into each other&rsquo;s dreadful faces and mutely asked what was to
    be done. How should they head the boat? Without a compass they might as well
    steer one way as another, for none of them knew even approximately the course
    for the nearest land; search the cloudless vault of blue above, or scan the
    shimmering sea-rim till their aching eyes dropped from out their hollowing
    sockets, there was no clue.</p>
  <p>Twenty days out the last particle of food and water had been consumed, and
    though the boat was now steering as near westward as old Ned could judge,
    before a gentle south-east trade, madness and despair were coming quickly
    upon them, and on the twenty-third day two of the five miserable creatures
    began to drink copiously of salt water&mdash;the drink of Death.</p>
  <p>Renton, though he had suffered to the bitter full from the agonies of body
    and mind endured by his shipmates, did not yield to this temptation; and
    by a merciful providence remained sane enough to turn his face away from
    the water. But as he lay crouched in a heap in the bottom of the boat, with
    a silent prayer in his heart to his Creator to quickly end his sufferings,
    he heard &ldquo;Boston Ned&rdquo; and the only remaining sane man except
    himself muttering hoarsely together and looking sometimes at him and sometimes
    at the two almost dying men who lay moaning beside him. Presently the man
    who was talking to Ned pulled out of his blanket&mdash;which lay in the stern-sheets&mdash;a
    razor, and turning his back to Renton began stropping it upon the sole of
    his boot, and even &ldquo;Boston Ned&rdquo; himself looked with awful eyes
    and blood-baked twitching lips upon the youngster.</p>
  <p>The lad saw what was coming, and as quickly as possible made his way forward
    and sat there, with his eyes fixed upon the two men aft, waiting for the
    struggle which he thought must soon begin. All that day and the night he
    sat and watched, determined to make a fight for the little life which remained
    in him, and Ned and the other man at times still muttered and eyed him wolfishly.</p>
  <p>And so, on and on, these seeming outcasts of God&rsquo;s mercy sailed before
    the warm breath of the south-east trade wind, above them the blazing tropic
    sun, around them the wide, sailless expanse of the blue Pacific unbroken
    in its dreadful loneliness except for a wandering grey-winged booby or flocks
    of whale-birds floating upon its gentle swell, and within their all but deadened
    hearts naught but grim despair and a dulled sense of coming dissolution.</p>
  <p>As he sat thus, supporting his swollen head upon his skeleton hands, Renton
    saw something astern, moving slowly after the boat&mdash;something that he
    knew was waiting and following for the awful deed to be done, so that <i>it</i> too
    might share in the dreadful feast.</p>
  <p>Raising his bony arm, he pointed towards the moving fin. To him a shark
    meant no added horror or danger to their position, but possibly deliverance. &ldquo;Boston
    Ned&rdquo; and the other man first looked at the coming shark, and then with
    sunken eyes again turned to Renton. Voices none of them had, and the lad&rsquo;s
    parched tongue could not articulate, but with signs and lip movements he
    tried to make the other two men understand.</p>
  <p>No shark hook had they; nor, if they had had one, had they anything with
    which to bait it. But Renton, crawling aft, picked up the harpoon, placed
    it in &ldquo;Boston Ned&rsquo;s&rdquo; hands, and motioned to him to stand
    by. Then with eager, trembling hands he stripped from his legs the shreds
    of trousers which remained on them, and, sitting upon the gunwale of the
    boat, hung one limb over and let it trail in the water.</p>
  <p>Three times the shark came up, and thrice Ned prepared to strike, but each
    time the grim ranger of the seas turned aside as it caught sight of the waiting
    figure with weapon poised above. But at last hunger prevailed, and, swimming
    slowly up till within a few yards of the boat, it made a sudden rush for
    the human bait, missed it, and the harpoon, deftly darted by the old ex-whaler,
    clove through its tough skin and buried itself deep into its body between
    the shoulders.</p>
  <p>It took the worn-out, exhausted men a long time to haul alongside and despatch
    the struggling monster, which, says Renton, was ten feet in length.</p>
  <p>Then followed shark&rsquo;s flesh and shark&rsquo;s blood, some of the former,
    after the first raw meal, being cooked on a fire made of the biscuit barge
    upon a wet blanket spread in the bottom of the boat. The hot weather, however,
    soon turned the remaining portion putrid, but two or three days later came
    God&rsquo;s blessed rain, and gave them hope and life again. They managed
    to save a considerable quantity of water, and, though the shark&rsquo;s flesh
    was in a horrible condition, they continued to feed upon it <i>until the
    thirty-fifth</i> day.</p>
  <p>On this day they saw land, high and well wooded; but now the trade-wind
    failed them, and for the following two days the unfortunate men contended
    with baffling light airs, calms, and strong currents. At last they got within
    a short distance of the shore, and sought for a landing-place through the
    surrounding surf.</p>
  <p>Suddenly four or five canoes darted out from the shore. They were filled
    with armed savages, whose aspect and demeanour warned old Ned that he and
    his comrades were among cannibals. Sweeping alongside the boat, the savages
    seized the white men, who were all too feeble to resist, or even move, put
    them into their canoes, and conveyed them on shore, fed them, and treated
    them with much apparent kindness. Crowds of natives from that part of the
    island&mdash;which was Malayta, one of the Solomon Group&mdash;came to look
    at them, and one man, a chief, took a fancy to Renton, and claimed him as
    his own especial property.</p>
  <p>Renton never saw the rest of his companions again, for they were removed
    to the interior of the Island&mdash;probably sold to some of the bush tribes,
    the &ldquo;man-a-bush,&rdquo; as the coastal natives called them. Their fate
    is not difficult to guess, for the people of Malayta were then, as they are
    now, cannibals.</p>
  <p>On August 7, 1875, the Queensland labour recruiting schooner <i>Bobtail
      Nag</i> was cruising off the island, trading for yams, and her captain
      heard from some natives who came alongside that there was a white man living
      ashore in a village about ten miles distant. The skipper of the <i>Bobtail
      Nag</i> at once offered to pay a handsome price if the man was brought
      on board, and at the cost of several dozen Birmingham steel axes and some
      tobacco poor Renton&rsquo;s release was effected. He told his rescuers
      that the people among whom he had lived had taken a great fancy to him,
      and had treated him with great kindness.</p>
  <p>If the reader will look at a chart of the South Pacific, he will see, among
    the Phoenix Group, the position of McKean&rsquo;s Island; two thousand miles
    distant, westward and southward, is the island of Malayta, upon which Renton
    and his companions in misery drifted.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sarréo"></a>Sarr&eacute;o</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s niggers an&rsquo; niggers, some just as good
    as any white man,&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Potter as he, the second mate of
    the island-trading barque <i>Reconnaisance</i>, and Denison the supercargo,
    walked her short, stumpy poop one night, &ldquo;though when I was before
    the mast I couldn&rsquo;t stand one of &rsquo;em bunking too close to me&mdash;not
    for a long time. But after awhile I found out that a Kanaka or a Maori is
    better than the usual run of the paint-scrubbing Jack Dog who calls himself
    a sailorman nowadays. Why, I&rsquo;ve never seen a native sailor yet as was
    dirty in his habits&mdash;they&rsquo;re too fond o&rsquo;  the water. Look
    at these Rotumah chaps aboard here&mdash;if there&rsquo;s a calm they&rsquo;ll
    jump overboard and take a swim instead of turning in when it&rsquo;s their
    watch below. Bah, white sailors ain&rsquo;t worth feeding in this Island
    trade&mdash;lazy, dirty, useless brutes; a Kanaka is worth three of any one
    of &rsquo;em. Did you notice that photograph in my cabin&mdash;that one showing
    a ship&rsquo;s company standing on deck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; replied Denison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the crew of the <i>Fanny Long</i>, and amongst &rsquo;em
    is a fellow I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell you about&mdash;a chap named Sarr&eacute;o.
    We had that picture taken in Hobart after we had come back from a sperm whaling
    cruise. We had been very lucky, and the skipper and owners had all our photographs
    taken in a group. I was second mate, and this Sarr&eacute;o was one of the
    boatsteerers. Him and me had been shipmates before, once in the old <i>Meteor</i> barque,
    nigger-catching for the Fiji planters, and once in a New Bedford sperm whaler,
    and he had taken a bit of a liking to me, so whenever I got a new ship he
    generally shipped too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I was tired of whaling; I had two ribs broke on that cruise
    in the <i>Fanny Lang</i>, by a boat being stove in by a whale. So after I
    had got my money I walked out of the office, thinking of going to Sydney
    by the steamboat, when up comes Sarr&eacute;o.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Got your dollars, Sarr&eacute;o?&rsquo; I says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answers. &lsquo;What you goin&rsquo; to do
    now, Mr. Potter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Going to Sydney to look for another ship.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; he says quietly. &lsquo;I come too. I don&rsquo; want
    to go whalin&rsquo; no more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure enough, when I went on board the steamer there he was for&rsquo;ard
    sitting on his chest, smoking his pipe, an&rsquo; waiting for me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Sydney there was a fine big lump of a schooner just fitting out
    for a trading cruise to the Solomon Islands, and I happened to know the skipper,
    who worked it for me with the owners and I got the berth of chief mate; and
    Sarr&eacute;o (who used to come every day to the place I was staying at to
    ask me not to forget him) was shipped as an A.B.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What sort of a looking man? Well, he was a short, square-built chap,
    with a chest like a working bullock. He was rather darker than a Samoan or
    a Tahiti man, owing to a seafaring life, and had straight, black hair. He
    only spoke as a rule when he was spoken to, and kept himself pretty much
    aloof from the rest of the hands, though he wasn&rsquo;t by any means sulky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did he hail from?&rdquo; Denison inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, now you&rsquo;re asking, sir. There was a beast of a supercargo&mdash;I
    beg pardon, sir, for forgetting myself&mdash;a reg&rsquo;lar flash, bullying
    pig of a fellow, with us that trip. He put on as many airs as if he owned
    the whole blooming Pacific. Well, one day he was straightening up his trade-room,
    and calls for a couple of hands to help, and the skipper sent Sarr&eacute;o
    and another native sailor to him. We were then lying at anchor in Marau Sound,
    in the Solomons, and the sun was hot enough to blister the gates o&rsquo; hell,
    and presently the supercargo comes on deck and slings his fat, ugly carcase
    into a deck chair under the awning and says&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a smart fellow, that Sarr&eacute;o, Potter. Where
    does he come from?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I didn&rsquo;t know, and said so; so Mr. Supercargo grunts and
    says that he&rsquo;d ask him himself. Presently up comes Sarr&eacute;o and
    the other native&mdash;they were going for&rsquo;ard for their dinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here, I say you,&rsquo; said the supercargo to Sarr&eacute;o,
    touching him on the calf of the leg with his foot as he was passing, &lsquo;what
    island you belong to, eh?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarr&eacute;o turned like lightning, and I caught a sight of his
    face. He had dark, deep-set eyes and they seemed to spit fire at the
    fat brute in the chair, and his two brown hands shut tight; but he said nothing,
    not a blessed word, only looked as if all the rest of his body was turned
    to stone. He stood like that for about ten seconds or so, then he bent his
    head close to the other man&rsquo;s face and put his two clenched fists out
    behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here, Sarr&eacute;o,&rsquo; I says, collaring him by one arm, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s
    all these gymnastics? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He pushed me aside as if I was a feather, then he straightens himself
    up sudden, and, lookin&rsquo; at the supercargo, spits on the deck at his
    feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You dog,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;when we get ashore I will
    fight you!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Warby,&rsquo; that was the supercargo&rsquo;s name, was no
    cur, whatever else he was, but though he seemed mighty sick when he heard
    Sarr&eacute;o call him a dog, he jumped up at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You damned Kanaka swine! You&rsquo;re drunk! You&rsquo;ve
    been sneaking a bottle of gin in the trade-room, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll give
    you a pounding,&rsquo; he says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then before any one could interfere they were at it, and in less
    than a couple of minutes Sarr&eacute;o had the supercargo by the throat,
    lifted him off his feet, and dashes him down on the poop. He lay there stunned,
    an&rsquo; I tell you, mister, I was mighty pleased, for we all hated him
    for his beastly bullyin&rsquo;  ways, and his foul talk. So none of us rushed
    at him too violently to pick him up. Presently up comes the skipper and orders
    me to put Sarr&eacute;o in irons, though I could see he didn&rsquo;t half
    like doing it. But it had to be done, and I had to do it. However, Sarr&eacute;o
    held out his hands to me as quiet as a lamb, and I led him for&rsquo;ard
    and told him to keep a stiff upper lip; the captain, I knew, would let him
    loose again the next morning. He nodded his head quietly and said, &lsquo;All
    right, Mr Potter. But when we get ashore <i>I mus&rsquo; kill that man</i>.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Sarr&eacute;o,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
    talk like that, you&rsquo;ve nearly cracked his skull as it is. Don&rsquo;t
    you go on that tack, or it&rsquo;ll be worse for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He nods again. &lsquo;I know. But I have been look for that man for
    more&rsquo;n five year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, do you know him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I know him <i>now</i>. When I see him roll up his shirt-sleeve
    in the trade-room, an&rsquo; I see some tattoo mark on his arm, I know him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I asked him what the supercargo had done to him, but he
    wouldn&rsquo;t tell me any more. So, telling one of the hands to give him
    his pipe and tobacco, I went aft again and told the skipper that there seemed
    to be an old grudge between the two men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Like enough,&rsquo; says the skipper. &lsquo;That fellow Warby is
    the two ends and bight of a howling blackguard. He was only appointed to
    this ship at the last moment, or else I would have bucked against his coming
    aboard. He&rsquo;s got a bad name.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warby lay in his bunk for the rest of the day, but in the evening
    he came on deck and said to the skipper roughly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you going to do with that damned nigger?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep him in irons for a day or two, I suppose. What more
    can I do?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warby looked at him for a moment, then he says, with a sneer, that
    in some ships the captain would have tied such a fellow up and given him
    six dozen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; says the skipper, looking him full in his
    ugly face, &lsquo;no doubt, especially in the sort of ships you&rsquo;ve
    sailed in. But nothing like that is going to happen aboard this hooker.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The supercargo muttered something under his breath and turned away.
    Next morning, however, when we were at breakfast, he asked the captain how
    long he meant to keep Sarr&eacute;o in irons.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Till after breakfast&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warby jumped up in a rage and said that he protested against such
    a man being given his liberty. &lsquo;Why, he&rsquo;ll murder me,&rsquo; he
    says at last with a white look in his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The skipper laughed. &lsquo;You make too much of the business, Mr.
    Warby. Why, he is one of the best and quietest men aboard. If you hadn&rsquo;t
    kicked him and then swore at him, he wouldn&rsquo;t have tackled you. And
    I&rsquo;m not going to keep him in irons&mdash;that&rsquo;s flat.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After breakfast I went up for&rsquo;ard to take the irons off Sarr&eacute;o.
    He was sitting against the windlass and smoking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here, Sarr&eacute;o,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come
    to take off your bracelets; but you must promise not to have any more rows
    with the supercargo; if you won&rsquo;t promise, then the captain says he&rsquo;ll
    have to keep you in irons until we get to Fiji, and then send you to jail.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He promised, and from the quiet, soft manner in which he spoke, I
    felt sure he was over his burst of passion, and was feeling a bit funky over
    it. However, he turned-to very quietly, and was soon sent ashore with a watering
    party, he being in charge of the boat which was manned by native sailors.
    When he came back with the first lot of casks he told me that the bush around
    the watering-place was full of pigeons. As soon as the captain heard this
    he said he would go ashore and shoot some, and Mr. Warby said he would like
    to join him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So off they went&mdash;skipper, supercargo, and Sarr&eacute;o and
    his boat&rsquo;s crew. We on board soon heard the two guns firing, and were
    smacking our chops at the thought of pigeon stew for supper. I did not expect
    to see them back until about supper-time, knowing that the boat had to tow
    the casks off to the ship, which lay about half a mile from the beach. But
    about four o&rsquo;clock I saw the boat pushing off in a deuce of a hurry,
    and then pull like mad for the ship. Knowing that there was no danger from
    natives at that part of the island, I couldn&rsquo;t make it out, but in
    a few minutes the boat dashes up alongside, and looking over the side I saw
    that Sarr&eacute;o was sitting beside the captain, in between him and Mr.
    Warby; his eyes were closed, and I thought he was dead at first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had him lifted up on deck and then carried into the cabin in a
    brace of shakes, and I saw that he had a bullet wound in his shoulder; the
    ball had gone clean through. Then the skipper, who was never much of a talker,
    told me that Mr. Warby had shot the man accidentally. Of course I looked
    at Warby. His face was very pale, but his eyes met mine without flinching.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take the captain long to dress the wound, and half
    an hour later, when I came below again, Sarr&eacute;o was sitting up on some
    cushions in the transoms smoking one of the captain&rsquo;s Manilas, and
    looking as if nothing had happened. He smiled when he saw me and put out
    his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m all right, Mr. Potter,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;not
    going to die this time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was just about to ask him how the thing happened, when Robertson&mdash;that
    was our skipper&rsquo;s name&mdash;called me into his room. He was as solemn
    as a judge. Closing his cabin door, he said, &lsquo;Sarr&eacute;o will get
    over it all right, but the business is an ugly one; to cut it short, I believe
    that it was no accident, but that Warby tried to murder the poor fellow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he told me what had occurred. Leaving the rest of the boat&rsquo;s
    crew to fill the water casks, they set out to shoot pigeons; Sarr&eacute;o
    went with them to pick up and carry the birds. About an hour later they saw
    a wild boar rush by them. Robertson fired both barrels at it and wounded
    it, but it didn&rsquo;t stop. Warby had one barrel empty. He at once loaded
    with ball, and the three men gave chase, Sarr&eacute;o leading, Warby following
    him close. On reaching some high grass at the river bank Sarr&eacute;o plunged
    into it; then, a few seconds later, Robertson heard Warby call out that he
    saw the animal lying down, and fired. The captain was a short distance behind,
    but he and Warby reached the spot together, and there, sure enough, lying
    in the long grass, was the wounded boar, and Sarr&eacute;o beside it, with
    the blood pouring from his shoulder. He was sitting up, supporting himself
    on his left hand. The skipper assisted him to his feet, and Warby tried to
    help, but Sarr&eacute;o turned on him and cursed him, and said that he (Warby)
    had tried to murder him. The supercargo swore that he had not seen him when
    he fired, but further talk was cut short by Sarr&eacute;o going faint through
    loss of blood, so they carried him to the boat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was the story so far, and Robertson asked me what I thought
    of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I had been shipmates with Sarr&eacute;o off and on for a matter
    of five or six years, and I never knew him to tell a lie; but at the same
    time I couldn&rsquo;t think Warby would be such a brute as to try and murder
    the man in cold blood. The skipper, however, took a very black view of the
    matter, and told me that if we met a man-of-war he would put Warby in irons,
    signal for a boat, and hand him over on a charge of attempted murder. Then
    we went out into the main cabin and sat down, and Robertson told the steward
    to call the supercargo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warby came below at once. He gave a quick glance at Sarr&eacute;o,
    then at the skipper and myself, and sat down quietly. In less than a minute
    the captain told him of his suspicions and what he intended doing if we met
    a man-of-war.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought Warby would bluster and blaspheme in his usual way; but
    he didn&rsquo;t. He listened in silence. Then he rose and put his hands on
    the cabin table, and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Before God, I swear to you both that I am innocent I did not
    fire at that man; I did not even see him again after he disappeared into
    the grass&mdash;as the Almighty is my judge, I did not... I did mean to take
    it out of Sarr&eacute;o for nearly breaking my skull the other day; but then
    I remembered afterwards that he had cause to hate me, and I was only waiting
    for a chance to ask him to make it up. And I say again that I am no cowardly
    murderer; when I fired, I fired at the boar or what I honestly thought was
    the boar, struggling in the grass. You can put me in irons now if you like;
    or shut me up in my cabin. I&rsquo;m not going to sit down at the same table
    with men who suspect me of attempted murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was something in his voice which made us believe him, and then
    he took a couple of turns up and down the cabin deck, and stepped up to the
    wounded man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sarr&eacute;o, I did you a bad turn a long time ago; but I&rsquo;m
    sorry for it now&mdash;I have been sorry for it ever since. But I did not
    know where to find you, and I would not have known you yesterday if you hadn&rsquo;t
    looked into my face and spoken. It&rsquo;s ten years since that day, Sarr&eacute;o.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wounded man looked up, searching-like, into Warby&rsquo;s face
    all the time he was speaking; then his big black eyes drooped again, but
    he made no answer. So then Warby went on again, talking to the lot of us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was supercargo on the <i>Manola</i> brig, and Sarr&eacute;o
    here was one of the hands. One day, in Apia harbour, a bag of dollars was
    stolen out of my cabin. The steward next morning said he had seen Sarr&eacute;o
    ashore at one of the dance houses spending money very freely. The captain
    and I burst open his chest, and we found about twenty Mexican dollars among
    his clothes. Now, in the bag which had been stolen there were nearly five
    hundred Mexican dollars. Sarr&eacute;o swore he had not stolen the money
    and that all the money he had spent on shore was five dollars, which he had
    brought with him from San Francisco. But the skipper and I believed he was
    the thief, and to make him own up and tell us where the rest of the dollars
    were, we flogged him. Then we put him in irons and kept him in irons for
    a week. He still swore he had not taken the money, and I, believing he was
    lying, gave him another thrashing on my own account. That night he got overboard
    and swam ashore, and we gave the money up for lost Well, about a week after
    this, when the steward was ashore, the mate and I decided to make a thorough
    search of <i>his</i> cabin. We found nothing there, but we did in the pantry&mdash;we
    found the missing bag of dollars, all but the twenty which he had put into
    Sarr&eacute;o&rsquo;s chest&mdash;stowed away in the bottom of half a barrel
    of flour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As soon as Sarr&eacute;o heard this, the poor fellow almost began
    to cry, and said, &lsquo;I told you, Mr. Warby, I no steal that money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Sarr&eacute;o, I know you didn&rsquo;t&mdash;that is,
    I knew it when the steward owned up to stealing it; and told us afterward
    that he took twenty dollars out of the bag, and, seeing your chest lying
    open in the deck-house, he slipped in when no one was about and put the money
    among the clothes at the bottom.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarr&eacute;o sighed, pleased-like, and then his brown face lit up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The big supercargo came a bit nearer to him, and then held out his
    hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Sarr&eacute;o! The day before yesterday I was wrong,
    but you got my blood up; and I am sorry, very sorry, for the wrong I did
    you on board the <i>Manola</i>; but so help me God, Sarr&eacute;o, I <i>did
    not</i> fire at you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarr&eacute;o&rsquo;s eyes seemed to look right through the white
    man; then they turned towards the skipper and me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe you, Mr. Warby,&rsquo; said the skipper, coming
    up and shaking hands with the supercargo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I believed him too, for he looked terribly distressed and cut
    up, so I shook hands with him too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Sarr&eacute;o put out his big brown tattooed hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And me too, Mr. Warby.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The supercargo pressed it gently, so as not to hurt Sarr&eacute;o&rsquo;s
    shoulder, then he almost ran past us on deck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, from that time out, that man Warby changed, and he looked after
    Sarr&eacute;o all the time he was laid up, as if he had been his own brother
    instead of a Kanaka chap before the mast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After leaving Marau Sound we stood to the northward, being bound
    to Bougainville Island. It took us more than a month to get there, and by
    that time Sarr&eacute;o was as well and strong as ever he was, and me and
    the skipper had got quite chummy with the supercargo, for we found out that
    he had a lot of good points about him. You see, mister, ten or twelve years
    ago the Solomon Group was the place to show what a man was made of&mdash;as
    far as that goes it&rsquo;s not much altered since. If you don&rsquo;t die
    of fever you&rsquo;re pretty sure to get knocked on the head and go down
    the nigger&rsquo;s gullets&mdash;and this chap Warby had rare pluck. He never
    ran a boat&rsquo;s crew into danger, but would take any risks himself, and
    somehow we had cruised right up from Marau Sound to the north end of Bougainville
    without losing a man, or having more than a few arrows or shots fired at
    the boats.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just when we were about to brace up to round Bouka Island, and being
    about three miles off the land, we sighted the hull of a vessel ashore on
    the beach of a small bay. We stood in for a mile or so and saw that there
    was a native village at the head of the bay, and that the vessel was a schooner
    of about a hundred tons. There were no signs of any boats and she seemed
    to be stripped of both running and standing gear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We manned and armed two boats&mdash;one, with Mr. Warby in charge,
    being the landing-party; and the other as a covering boat in case the natives
    attacked. I had charge of the second boat and had four white sailors; Warby
    had Sarr&eacute;o and four other natives. The skipper told us to have a good
    look at the vessel, then try and learn what the natives on shore had to say
    about her, and then come off and report.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We pulled right in to the wreck as close as we could get, for it
    was low tide. Then Warby and I got out and walked over to it. We found that
    she was stripped of everything of value, even the chain-plates having been
    cut out, the decks were torn up and partly burnt, and the anchors and cables
    were gone; in fact, she was nothing but a shell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Been looted by the niggers,&rsquo; I said to Warby. &lsquo;Hope
    the poor chaps that manned her got away in the boat; better for &rsquo;em
    to have been drowned than be eaten by these beggars about here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my
    opinion they did get away safely. Look over there, Potter, at those niggers
    waiting for us on the beach; now if they had cut off this vessel they would
    have bolted into the bush, or begun firing at us. Come on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We walked back to the boats and then pulled over to the village,
    which was about eight hundred yards away, Warby&rsquo;s boat, of course,
    going first. About thirty or forty natives came down to the water&rsquo;s
    edge and waited. They were all armed with bows, spears, and clubs, but seemed
    friendly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However, Warby jumped boldly out on to the beach, and telling his
    crew to keep her afloat in case he had to run for it, he went up to the crowd
    of niggers and shook hands with some of them; I and my chaps in the covering
    boat keeping our rifles out of view, but quite ready.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In about five minutes Warby sang out to me that it was all right.
    The vessel, the natives told him, had parted her cables, gone ashore and
    bilged on the reef in the night; and the hands being too frightened to come
    ashore, had gone away next morning in two boats. Then he told me to wait
    a few minutes, as he was going to the chief&rsquo;s house to look at the
    copper and other gear that the natives had taken from the schooner, and very
    likely he would buy it. First of all, though, he told Sarr&eacute;o to pass
    him out a 12 lb. case of tobacco as a present for the chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He took the case from Sarr&eacute;o and handed it to the chief, and
    then off they went&mdash;he in the middle of thirty or forty murderous-looking
    savages; but he had done the same thing so often before that we did not feel
    any particular alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We lay there, backed stern on to the beach, for about five minutes,
    looking at the house into which he had gone with the natives. Suddenly we
    saw him burst out of the house and fall on his knees, trying to draw his
    revolver; but in another moment he was being tomahawked and clubbed by a
    mob of yelling devils! Poor chap, he must have died very quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We opened fire at once and they disappeared like magic, and then
    from every bush, tree, and rock they began firing at us in the boats with
    both muskets and arrows. One of my men was hit, and then, before I could
    stop him, Sarr&eacute;o had jumped out of his boat and was running up the
    beach, rifle in hand, to where Mr. Warby&rsquo;s body was lying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He got there, I think, without being hit, just as a big native ran
    at him with a tomahawk. He hadn&rsquo;t time to put his Snider to his shoulder;
    but that nigger gave his last jump anyway, for I saw the rifle go off and
    the nigger topple over. In another five seconds he had lifted the supercargo
    up, thrown him over his left shoulder, and was running down to the boats.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By this time, me and two of my crew had jumped out of the boat and
    ran to meet him, firing as we went. We had just reached him when down he
    went on to his face in the sand&mdash;a bullet had smashed his hip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dropping our rifles, we picked him and Mr. Warby&rsquo;s body up,
    and by God&rsquo;s mercy managed to tumble into the boat together and push
    off, covered by the fire from the ship, which carried two six-pounders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarr&eacute;o lived two days&mdash;he died the same morning that
    we were getting ready to take Warby&rsquo;s body ashore to bury on a little
    island between Bouka and Bougainville. So we made only one trip ashore. Poor
    chap! He had a good, simple heart, and almost his last words were that he &lsquo;was
    glad Mr. Warby wasn&rsquo;t eaten.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, as you say, Mr. Denison, the rotten South Seas ain&rsquo;t no
    place for a white man. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OfficerAndMan"></a>Officer And Man</b></h2>
  <p>The anchor of her Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Hannibal</i> was underfoot and
    the captain on the bridge, and Rear-Admiral Garnet had shaken hands with
    the last of the &ldquo;leading&rdquo; Fijian white residents, who always
    did the welcoming and farewelling when distinguished persons visited Levuka,
    when Lieutenant Bollard approached him and intimated that &ldquo;a person&rdquo; from
    the shore had just come alongside in a boat and desired to see &ldquo;his
    Excellency on private and important business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil does the fellow want?&rdquo; said the Admiral irascibly,
    not a whit softened by the &ldquo;his Excellency&rdquo; style of address; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    going on the bridge, and can&rsquo;t see any one now; we can&rsquo;t delay
    the ship and get into a mess going through the passage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Told him so, sir; but he says he wants to see you upon an important&mdash;a
    most pressing matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well! Confound him! Let the sentry show him to my cabin, and
    tell Captain Bracely I shall be up in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;person,&rdquo; conducted by the sentry, was shown into the cabin,
    where the Admiral, without taking a seat or offering one to his visitor,
    inquired with a cold, cautious politeness born of much experience of island
    visitors with &ldquo;important and private Service matters of great urgency,&rdquo; what
    he might be pleased to want?</p>
  <p>The stranger was a short, fat, coarse-looking man with little pig-like eyes
    and scanty tufts of black beard and whiskers growing in irregular patches
    on his cheeks and chin, like clumps of gorse on clayey banks. He was dressed&mdash;in
    a manner&mdash;in an ill-fitting black cloth suit imported from Sydney. His
    hair was very black and shiny, plastered down over his temples and beautifully
    parted at the back of his bullet head. Altogether he was an unpleasantly
    sleek, oleaginous creature, and as he stood bowing and smirking with a catlike
    grin, the Admiral felt an almost irresistible impulse to kick him out of
    the cabin. Notwithstanding his haste, however, he began to recollect the
    man as an individual who had been introduced to him a few days previously
    at some municipal function.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t recollect the fellow&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; he muttered
    to himself. &ldquo;I wonder what the devil the creature wants! Got a complaint
    against the Consul very likely&mdash;every one has a complaint against a
    Consul&mdash;it&rsquo;s a disease in the South Seas. Confound their twopenny-halfpenny
    squabbles!&rdquo; Then the little fat man, with another servile grin, spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish, your Excellency, to see you upon a matter which I think,
    as a loyal subject, it is my duty&mdash;my painful duty&mdash;to bring under
    your notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thought as much,&rdquo; said the Admiral to himself. &ldquo;Some
    row about a trader insulting a native teacher, or <i>vice-versa</i>.&rdquo; Then
    smothering an exclamation of impatience, he said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, sir? I have no time to lose. By the way, who are you,
    sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My name, your Excellency, is Obadiah Howlman. I had the distinguished
    honour, your Excellency, of showing your Excellency over the grounds of the
    new Mission College. I was the contractor for the erection of that ornament
    to our little town.&rdquo; And again the oily creature smirked and bowed
    and did the invisible soap business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely <i>you</i> are not a missionary, sir?&rdquo; asked the Admiral,
    with undisguised contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not, your Excellency. That is, I am not yet an ordained labourer
    in the Vineyard, your Excellency; but I hope soon to be one. Meanwhile, all
    the time that is left to me from my business (I am a storekeeper and contractor)
    is given to the cause of spreading the Light I was once a lost soul, your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; interrupted the Admiral, with ill-disguised
    disgust and open impatience, &ldquo;but do, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, tell
    me what is your complaint. I am due in Sydney on the tenth of this month,
    and the ship is already under way. As it is, we shall have to stop outside
    the reef to let you get into your boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am aware of it, your Excellency, and I should not have ventured
    to detain you, but this is a very serious matter&mdash;I may say, a criminal
    matter. When I had the honour of meeting your Excellency, on the occasion
    of your Excellency&rsquo;s visit to the College, I would have spoken of this
    matter then; but my poor, weak nature was so torn by conflicting emotions
    that I <i>could</i> not And for the past two nights have I struggled and
    wrestled in spirit, and sought Divine guidance. &rsquo;Tis indeed hard for
    one man to reveal the sins and wickedness of a fellow-sinner&mdash;knowing
    that we are all but weak vessels. But yet in this case it is my bounden duty
    as a loyal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on&mdash;go on, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! What on earth is the
    matter? And what the deuce do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Excellency, I wish, in all sorrow and tribulation of spirit,
    to give you information as to the whereabouts of a deserter from her Majesty&rsquo;s
    Navy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir? None of my men are missing, and if any were,
    I&rsquo;d tell the Fijian police about it, and not delay the <i>Hannibal</i>,&rdquo; and
    with a curt nod the Admiral turned on his heel and was about to leave the
    cabin, when the man stepped forward and interrupted him, saying&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One word more, your Excellency. There is in connection with this
    case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The reward. Yes, of course. I forgot all about that. If there is
    a deserter from any of her Majesty&rsquo;s ships living ashore here, you
    will get the usual reward, I have no doubt. But really, sir, this is a matter
    that you must arrange with the police when the next man-of-war comes here,
    or go to the Consul&rdquo;&mdash;and then, <i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;&ldquo;or
    the devil, confound you!&rdquo; and the Admiral more than ever felt inclined
    to kick his visitor out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You quite mistake me, Admiral Garnet I have no wish to claim an earthly
    reward for doing my duty to my Queen and country. Since I have lived in these
    islands the Lord has prospered me in my worldly affairs, and I am in a position
    far above taking payment in money for doing my duty. I am, I trust, walking
    in the Light, and do not want to obtain wealth&mdash;which is but of this
    world&mdash;for performing such duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, well, I am sure I beg your pardon, Mr. Howlman. But now I really
    cannot talk any longer here, so please do not keep me. At the same time if
    there is a deserter here I don&rsquo;t see what business it is of yours to
    interest yourself in his capture. Don&rsquo;t you think you have enough to
    do to look after your store, and contracting, and your <i>alleged</i> missionary
    business, without running after deserters?&rdquo; And inwardly the Admiral
    cursed his visitor for a meddlesome ass. He was in a hurry to get to sea,
    and yet this fellow might make it necessary for the ship to be delayed till
    the deserter was apprehended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My humble connection with missionaries, Admiral, has taught me that,
    at whatever cost to my own feelings, my duty as a loyal subject must, next
    to my duty as a Christian, be performed honestly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes. That&rsquo;s all right, I meant no disrespect to the
    missionaries. Many of the <i>gentlemen</i> engaged in missionary work in
    these islands have rendered very valuable services to her Majesty&rsquo;s
    ships on many occasions,&rdquo; and then to himself,  &ldquo;and given us
    a devil of a lot of trouble as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; the Admiral resumed, &ldquo;having explained that
    the Consul or police will attend to this deserter, you will allow me to say &lsquo;Good-day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One moment more, sir,&rdquo; and a spiteful green lit up the little
    piggish eyes. &ldquo;I desire, as a British subject, to speak to you privately
    on this matter, and to you alone. There are reasons&mdash;very particular
    reasons&mdash;why her Majesty&rsquo;s Consul or the Fiji police here cannot
    deal with this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; sighed the Admiral resignedly; &ldquo;sit down,
    Mr. Howlman. I see I am in for it, and so I&rsquo;ll send for my secretary
    and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot this matter be arranged without a third party?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir; it CANNOT!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Admiral said this with so much emphasis, and rang the bell with so much
    force at the same moment, that the sentry almost jumped into the cabin to
    see what was the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pass the word for Mr. Hayling to come to my cabin, and to the captain
    that I shall not be with him for ten minutes yet. Ten minutes will do your
    business, Mr. Howlman, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Excellency,&rdquo; and an evil smile crossed the
    man&rsquo;s repulsive features.</p>
  <p>The marine saluted, the secretary appeared, and the Admiral, nodding towards
    Mr. Howlman in anything but a friendly manner, growled: &ldquo;My secretary,
    Mr. Hayling. This is Mr. Howlman, Mr. Hayling; he has a communication to
    make about a deserter. Now, sir, proceed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the man, producing a photograph and laying it on
    the table,  &ldquo;is a portrait of a person named George Barcom, who, I
    have every reason to believe, was a sergeant of marines on the <i>Flycatcher</i> when
    she was on this station five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take charge of that photograph, Mr. Hayling. Go ahead, Mr. Howlman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This man, after deserting from the <i>Flycatcher</i> at a place in
    this group called Yasawa, managed to make his way to the island of Niuafou,
    where at that time I was in temporary charge of the Christian Cultivation
    Association&rsquo;s trading station. He came to the island in an open boat
    from the Yasawa Group, and was not suspected until quite recently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deuced long time finding him out. But proceed, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guilty as the man was of the crime of desertion, I must yet, perforce,
    say that he behaved himself very well. He was kindly received by the King
    Tepuaka (a very earnest seeker after the Light), and all went well for the
    space of four years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what happened then? Five minutes left,&rdquo; and the Admiral
    looked at his watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My story will soon be told, your Excellency. The man, who calls himself
    George Barcom, gained the affections of Tuilagi,(&ldquo;Queen of the Sky&rdquo;;
    a name common in Polynesia) the youngest daughter of the King. She, although
    not a seeker after the truth, was yet beginning to display some interest
    in the teachings of Christianity, and was an exceedingly comely young woman.&rdquo; Here
    Mr. Howlman clasped his fat hands together and cast up his eyes. &ldquo;But
    her father, at my suggestion, objected to their union. One night Barcom and
    the poor, misguided girl were missing. They had fled in an open boat to another
    island called Anuda&mdash;one of those dark places of the earth where the
    good seed has not yet been sown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what was the nature and reason of your objection to their marriage?&rdquo;  said
    the Admiral quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had every reason by this time to believe that the man was a deserter,
    and in my capacity as a preacher of the Gospel&mdash;though not ordained
    as such&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confine yourself to the subject, if you please,&rdquo; interrupted
    the Admiral, with a mingled look of impatience and disgust. &ldquo;You are
    not a missionary, you tell me, and I&rsquo;m hanged if I&rsquo;m going to
    listen to a sermon in my own cabin just now. Yet I have already given you
    as much of my time as if you were one. But don&rsquo;t trespass on my good
    nature too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought it my duty to interfere and prevent such a wicked and improper
    marriage. And, your Excellency, this carrying away the young woman against
    her father&rsquo;s wishes was very detrimental to the progress of the Mission
    work. As I have said, she was beginning to evince a certain concern for her
    soul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound it, man! why will you so persistently harp upon irrevelant
    matters that do not, as far as I can see, possibly concern what you really
    want to tell me? Have you a brief to speak for the missionaries? I am acquainted
    with the principal <i>gentlemen</i> (again he emphasised the word) who conduct
    mission work in the South Seas, but I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I ever heard
    your name before&mdash;not even as a house-builder, or whatever your vocation
    is.&rdquo; And then, with a quick glance at the cunning visage of Howlman,
    he added, &ldquo;I suppose you knew this young woman very well&mdash;perhaps
    were a particular friend of hers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Obadiah Howlman coughed. &ldquo;Hm&mdash;er. Well, your Excellency,
    my dear wife, who has now departed to her rest&mdash;an indeed well-earned
    rest&mdash;when alive, took much interest in this young girl, and, before
    she was called away, besought me to cherish and protect her. And, as time
    went on, there <i>was</i> formed, I may say, an attachment between this young
    creature and myself&mdash;that is, of course, such an attachment as could
    exist between a young woman of this kind, yearning for instruction, and her
    spiritual adviser and guide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I quite understand, Mr. Howlman. Mr. Hayling has notes
    of your statement, and the photograph. Now, if you will kindly keep your
    own counsel on the matter, you will hear in due course that we have arrested
    this man, and then, I think, you will be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then turning to his secretary, the Admiral said, &ldquo;The <i>Spitfire</i> is
    due at Levuka about the 8th. Write a letter to Commander Arness, and tell
    him to call at Anuda and arrest a deserter from the marines, calling himself
    George Barcom, and who can be identified by this photograph. He is the only
    white man on the island, so this Mr. Howlman says, and there should be no
    difficulty in finding him. That will satisfy you, I presume, Mr. Howlman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite, sir, I assure you. I have done my duty and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day, sir. You will just have time to get into your boat and
    get ashore while we are in smooth water, and before we start the engines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Admiral did not seem to notice the little fat man&rsquo;s outstretched
    hand. The secretary bowed him out of the cabin, holding the photograph in
    one hand and his notebook in the other. Neither of them liked his look well
    enough to shake hands with him.</p>
  <p>The Admiral, however, did not give the order to start the engines immediately,
    for the sentry, in accordance with orders received from the secretary, waited
    till Mr. Obadiah Howlman was at the foot of the accommodation-ladder, and
    then called out, &ldquo;Hold on that boat a minute or two; the Admiral wants
    to send a letter ashore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For twenty minutes Mr. Howlman waited impatiently in the boat, and then
    a big, official-looking letter was handed down the ladder to the boatman,
    addressed:  &ldquo;O.H.M.S.&mdash;Commander Arness, H.M.S. <i>Spitfire</i> care
    of H.B.M. Consul, Levuka, Fiji.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Howlman smiled to himself with the satisfied air of a man who has done
    his duty. He knew the contents of the letter, and recognised through its
    envelope the hard cardboard of the photograph of George Barcom enclosed therein.
    There was also a smaller note, addressed to Commander Arness by name, and
    marked, &ldquo;Private letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Five minutes later the <i>Hannibal</i> steamed through the passage, and
    shaped a course for Sydney.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The <i>Spitfire</i> was steaming full speed E.S.E. from Levuka. On the bridge
    was Commander Arness talking to the navigating lieutenant, a young and almost
    effeminate-looking officer.</p>
  <p>The land had just been sighted, and lay right ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will there be daylight enough left for us to get there and have this
    wretched thing over, Carteret?&rdquo; asked Commander Arness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plenty, sir, if this weather keeps up and you don&rsquo;t want to
    stay there more than a couple of hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Two hours should be ample time. This letter from Hayling explains
    the whole business,&rdquo; and he handed, the lieutenant the despatch from
    the Admiral&rsquo;s secretary, which duly set forth that the <i>Spitfire</i> was
    to take on board a certain white trader living on Anuda&mdash;otherwise,
    Cherry Island&mdash;and bring him prisoner to Sydney. His wife was to be
    returned to her father at Niuafou. The last paragraph in the letter was to
    this effect&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Be careful to identify beyond doubt this alleged deserter. The Rear-Admiral
    has received this information at the instant of sailing, and he is by no
    means certain that the statements of his informant can be depended upon.
    A photograph of the reputed deserter is enclosed herewith. The Admiral thinks
    that Mr. Carteret may know the man, as he was serving in the <i>Flycatcher</i> five
    years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This rascal Howlman has informed upon the poor devil for spite,&rdquo; said
    the Commander; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a private note from Hayling to myself
    about the fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lieutenant took the note and read&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;My dear Arness,&mdash;Just a line on my own account. Be careful what
    you are doing in this business. The fellow who informed is a sort of hanger-on
    to the missionaries here. They don&rsquo;t think much of him, but seem to
    put up with the swab as a necessary evil. He confessed that jealousy had
    something to do with the matter, and I could see the Admiral wanted to kick
    him out of the cabin. Make sure that this man Barcom is a deserter, or there
    will be the devil to pay if he should prove to be an American citizen, or
    anything of that kind.&mdash;Yours, Charles Hayling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see why they have left the matter to us, Carteret. You were on
    the <i>Flycatcher</i> five years ago, and the Admiral thinks you may be able
    to identify this fellow. Of course Barcom is not his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Carteret at this moment was very busy with the chart, over which he
    bent his head a moment, and then turned sharply to the man at the wheel,
    who was not out of earshot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep your course,&rdquo; he said sharply; &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t
    you attend to your steering!&rdquo; Then he turned to the commander: &ldquo;I
    beg your pardon, sir; you were saying?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was saying that you ought to remember such an incident as a sergeant
    of marines deserting from the <i>Flycatcher</i> when she was down here five
    years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do remember it. The man&rsquo;s name was Charles Parker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that the man?&rdquo; And Arness handed him a photograph of a man
    dressed in white ducks and a straw hat, evidently taken by an amateur.</p>
  <p>Carteret looked at the photograph for fully a couple of minutes before he
    answered slowly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think that this is the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few hours later the <i>Spitfire</i> had steamed in close to the land,
    and a boat was lowered. In this boat were Lieutenant Carteret, a sergeant
    of marines, with three privates and half a dozen bluejackets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have force enough to take a boat-load of deserters,&rdquo; remarked
    the lieutenant to his commander, as he descended the poop ladder on his way
    to the boat.</p>
  <p>Commander Arness laughed. &ldquo;Oh, well, you know the natives might take
    it into their heads to resist his arrest. But be careful what you are doing:
    make perfectly sure that he <i>is</i> the man. You don&rsquo;t know what
    complications might arise if we carried off the wrong person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The moment the boat touched the shore, she was surrounded by a crowd of
    friendly, brown-skinned islanders, who seemed delighted to see the strangers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any one of you fellows speak English?&rdquo; asked Mr. Carteret</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and a big, burly fellow with a fine open countenance
    advanced to the officer. &ldquo;Me speak English, and plenty more men here
    speak it, too. What you want, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any white men living here?&rdquo; asked Carteret quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;one, a very good man; his name is Joajai&rdquo; (George).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take me to his house,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;I want to see
    him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a few minutes Mr. Carteret and his marines were being conducted up a
    steep and rugged path towards the white trader&rsquo;s house, which was situated
    quite apart from the native village, while the bluejackets were left in the
    boat, remarking to each other that this white man was a most cursed unfriendly
    sort of a chap not to come down to the beach when he saw a man-of-war&rsquo;s
    boat ashore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be such a fool, Tom,&rdquo; said the coxswain to
    one of the men.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always a-jumpin&rsquo; at conclusions
    too rapid. Just you wait a bit and see. It&rsquo;s my belief that this chap
    has been up to something, and the marines have gone with Carteret to scruff
    him and bring him aboard. I saw the sergeant had a pair of darbies, and what
    do you suppose that Carteret&rsquo;s come ashore with a regular escort for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A ten minutes&rsquo; walk and Lieutenant Carteret and his men, guided by
    a number of natives, reached the white man&rsquo;s thatched dwelling, which
    stood amid a grove of banana and bread-fruit trees. When within a few yards,
    the lieutenant saw a tall, graceful young native girl, clad in semi-European
    style, advance to the open door, and then with a terrified exclamation withdraw
    again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is Tui,(The diminutive of Tuilagi<i>)</i> Joajai&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said
    one of the natives, pointing to the girl, who now again appeared, and, with
    her full dark eyes dilated with alarm, timidly held out her hand to the officer
    and murmured something in the native tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She speaks English, but she is afraid of the men with the guns,&rdquo; explained
    the native guide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is your husband?&rdquo; said Lieutenant Carteret, motioning
    to the girl to seat herself, and the marines to stand back.</p>
  <p>She only shook her head, and turned inquiringly to the natives who accompanied
    the officer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The white man is away on the other side of the island, sir. He be
    here in &rsquo;bout one half-hour,&rdquo; said the English-speaking native. &ldquo;Suppose
    you like, sir, I send some one go tell him come quick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carteret hesitated a moment, then answered &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then turning
    to the sergeant of marines, he said, &ldquo;Let your men fall still further
    back, sergeant This is a delicate matter, and I don&rsquo;t want this confounded
    crowd of natives, many of whom understand English, to hear what I have to
    say to this woman. Send a man down to the boat, and tell the coxswain that
    I shall have to wait for some time. If the ship makes a signal, the boat
    can go off and tell the captain that I shall have to wait; then she can come
    back for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All this time the trader&rsquo;s young wife sat trembling upon a rude couch
    that stretched across one side of the room; and her eyes never left the officer&rsquo;s
    face for an instant, save when for a moment she gave a terrified glance at
    the rifles and bayonets of the marine escort.</p>
  <p>The moment that the marines had fallen back the lieutenant stepped forward
    and took the young woman by the hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tui,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, drawing her to the further end of
    the room with firm but gentle hand, and speaking so low and without motion
    of his lips that none but she knew that he spoke at all, &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s
    sake and for mine and your husband&rsquo;s, do not be frightened, but listen
    to me and do exactly as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still trembling like a startled fawn, the girl raised her lustrous eyes
    to the young officer&rsquo;s face. His earnest, sincere manner and expression
    of deep concern seemed to reassure her, and though her bosom heaved and her
    breath came in quick, short gasps, she turned her face to him in the confidence
    of dawning hope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you, sir, and what do you wan&rsquo; my husban&rsquo; for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell these natives to go,&rdquo; said the lieutenant &ldquo;Have
    no fear. I am your husband&rsquo;s friend; but, <i>be quick</i><i>!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still, with a wondering look upon her beautiful face, the girl advanced
    to the door, said something in the island tongue to the crowd of curious
    natives, and then gently closed the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a rum go!&rdquo; said the sergeant of marines to himself,
    as he saw the door shut to. &ldquo;What the devil has the girl been doing?
    Are the bracelets for her, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tui,&rdquo; said Lieutenant Carteret, the moment they were alone, &ldquo;time
    presses. You speak English so well as to thoroughly understand that which
    I am now about to tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she answered, standing before him with clasped hands, &ldquo;I
    think so. A white woman who is dead now taught me to read and write English,
    and my husban&rsquo; always talk English to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good. Then listen to me, my girl. I am Lieutenant Carteret, of H.M.S. <i>Spitfire</i>&mdash;that
    ship out there&mdash;sent here with the ship&rsquo;s police to arrest a deserter
    from the <i>Flycatcher</i> on this station five years ago. This is the man&rsquo;s
    photograph. He is said to be your husband, and calls himself George Barcom.
    Now, when I was an officer of the <i>Flycatcher</i>, I knew a man named Charles
    Parker&rdquo;&mdash;her face went a deadly pallor&mdash;&ldquo;who deserted
    the ship at the Yasawa Group in Fiji. I can, without doubt, identify this
    man. But, Tui, I have looked at this photograph when it was held in the hand
    of my captain, and said that this is <i>not</i> the man whom I knew as Charles
    Parker. But look at it yourself and tell me&mdash;is this the photograph
    of your husband, and is this man on this island?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With shaking fingers she took it from him, looked at it, and then raised
    her face to the officer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this the doin&rsquo; of a man called Obadiah Howlman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the lieutenant, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> the work
    of Obadiah Howlman. He brought this photograph to the Admiral only a few
    days ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A savage gleam came into her eyes. &ldquo;The brute! I kill him for <i>this</i> some
    day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will not save your husband, my girl,&rdquo; said Carteret; then
    he waited a moment and added, &ldquo;whatever it might do later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly the girl&rsquo;s dark eyes filled with tears, and she laid her
    hand on the officer&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is to be done, sir? For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo; you take
    my husband from me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>This</i> can be done. You have seen this photograph. You say that
    it is not that of your husband, don&rsquo;t you? But, Tui, I must do my duty,
    do you understand? I must see your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you are the man whose life he saved&mdash;for now I &lsquo;member
    your name and the story he told me long ago&mdash;you who say you are his
    friend, you would do this thing, you who in the ship gave him money so that
    he might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, my girl, till I have finished; then you will understand. Listen
    now. I will remain here, and you will yourself find your husband and bring
    him here to this house so that I may see him. Bring him here quickly, and
    by some way that my men cannot see his face. And then, Tui, when I have spoken
    to him, then for your sake and for his sake I will lie, and swear he is not
    the man I have been sent to take. Then, when my ship has gone, you&mdash;you
    and he&mdash;you must promise me this, Tui&mdash;must leave this island as
    quickly as possible; so that when Obadiah Howlman sends another warship here&mdash;as
    he will do&mdash;they may not discover that I am a liar and have been false
    to my duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, is this true? Surely you would not tell a lie to a poor
    native girl like me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go, my girl&rdquo;&mdash;and Carteret placed a kindly hand on her
    shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;go quickly to Parker&mdash;I know very well that he
    is not far off. <i>He</i> will believe what I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment she gazed intently into his face, as if she would read his
    soul; and then seizing his hand pressed it to her lips, and went out by the
    door that opened at the rear of the house.</p>
  <p>Then the lieutenant opened the front door and walked slowly across to where
    the marines were standing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take your men out of sight, sergeant. I don&rsquo;t want this fellow
    frightened until I know who he is. If he&rsquo;s the man we want, we&rsquo;ll
    have no trouble in getting him. I&rsquo;ve induced his wife to go and bring
    him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whistling softly in an unconcerned manner, he turned back and stood at the
    door of the house and waited there for perhaps ten minutes, until he saw
    the girl returning with a white man, who appeared to be ill and weak, for
    he had on a heavy top-coat, and a shawl wrapped round his neck in such a
    way that his features were almost entirely hidden.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Lieutenant Carteret allowed the man and woman to enter, and then followed,
    closing the door after him.</p>
  <p>As soon as he was inside, the white man threw off his muffler and turned
    towards the officer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must take me, sir,&rdquo; he said, speaking calmly. &ldquo;I
    cannot let you do this for me. I know, sir, that you cannot help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, by Heavens! Parker, I cannot take you. You jumped overboard and
    saved my life. I tell you, man, that I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do it. Do you think
    I can ever forget that awful thirty minutes, nearly six years ago, when you
    kept me afloat off the Bampton Shoal? Now, Parker, just listen. I have a
    plan; the whole thing is arranged as soon as we leave here. But you and your
    wife <i>must</i> get away from this island soon after the <i>Spitfire</i> leaves.
    That infernal sweep, Howlman, will be sure to send another man-of-war after
    you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen to me, sir. I, too, have a plan. You shall not ruin yourself
    for me. You are only a very young man, sir, and have the world before you.
    I dread nothing but the temporary separation from Tui here. To me my arrest
    means only dismissal from the service and a couple of years in gaol; and
    likely enough, I shall get back here again without much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste time, sir. Call the escort, but for God&rsquo;s
    sake, sir, do the thing quickly; look at my girl, sir, and let me get away
    before I break down too, and act the coward. If you don&rsquo;t call the
    escort at once, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You madman, Parker,&rdquo; began Carteret, and then Tui threw her
    arms round her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you tired of me?&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Is this how you would
    leave the woman who loves you, and who will be the mother of your child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The deserter caught her in his arms, and looking over his shoulder at the
    lieutenant, said, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, sir, don&rsquo;t wait. Call
    in your men and get it over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Parker, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake take this chance. I tell you, man,
    that I have no fear for myself. I don&rsquo;t care a straw about the Service
    if this is discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand aside, sir. I&rsquo;m not the man to let you sacrifice yourself
    for me&mdash;&rdquo; And unloosing his wife&rsquo;s arms from his
    neck, he advanced to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well; it is your own fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next instant the lieutenant threw open the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sergeant, bring your men here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Half an hour later Lieutenant Carteret reported to Commander Arness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have brought the prisoner on board, sir. He is a man named Charles
    Parker, and was sergeant of marines on the <i>Flycatcher?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, Mr. Carteret What have you done with his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She refused to leave, sir, and when we brought the man away, went
    off to the other side of the island.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>When the <i>Spitfire</i> reached Sydney, Charles Parker was duly tried by
    court-martial, and in consequence of the friendly exertions of the principal
    witness against him, Lieutenant Neil Carteret, was let off lightly. He was
    dismissed from the service, and sentenced to imprisonment in a Sydney jail
    for eighteen months.</p>
  <p>When his time had expired, he managed, after a few months of waiting about
    in Sydney, to work his way back to Anuda Island. And scarce had the boat
    touched the beach when he was seized by the welcoming arms of his native
    friends and carried ashore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it well with my wife, O friends?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is well with her,&rdquo; they answered; &ldquo;in a little while
    we will take you to her, but first let us tell thee of that which has befallen
    her on this island.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then they told him.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One day after the warship had gone,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;there
    came here a trading schooner from Niuafou. On the ship were Tepuaka, the
    King of Niuafou&mdash;the father of thy wife&mdash;and many of his men. And
    with him there came also the little fat white man named Opataia (Obadiah).
    All those men that came with Tepuaka, the King, were <i>lotu</i> (Christians).
    No sooner did they land, than Tepuaka and his friend, the fat little white
    man, Opataia, walked to the house of his daughter, thy wife, Tui, but all
    of his men he bade remain here in the village.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See,&rsquo; said one of these men of Niuafou to us vauntingly, &lsquo;see
    what has come to pass! Tuilagi refused to take for her husband the good and
    pious man Opataia, but fled with this common white man, who is no better
    than a heathen. And then what comes? This bad white man is caught by his
    countrymen and put in a prison with chains upon his body. So now the King
    comes for his daughter, for even now is Opataia willing to take her, though
    she is but of little worth, to my mind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While they spoke thus to us, Tepuaka and his white friend had gone
    to thy house, and there did Tui, thy wife, meet them with smiles to hide
    what lay in her heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get thee ready, thou wicked woman,&rsquo; said her father
    roughly to her;  &lsquo;get thee ready quickly to leave this heathen land
    and return to thy own country, where thou shalt be wife to this good man,
    Opataia, who desires thee still.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is well, my father,&rsquo; said Tui; &lsquo;but yet leave
    us now for a little. Surely if this man desires me for his house he can speak
    to me with his own mouth, and not through thine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So her father went without the house, and Opataia, the white man,
    remained with Tui.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then said the evil-faced white man to Tui: &lsquo;For the wrong that
    thou did&rsquo;st me by running away with that evil white man do I forgive
    thee, for I love thee well.&rsquo; And then he put his arms about her, and
    sought to embrace her after the manner of a lover.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then from beneath her gown did Tui take out a little gun that
    fires six bullets; and as the fat man, Opataia, pressed her to his bosom
    and heeded not what she did, she placed the mouth of the little gun to the
    side of his fat head. Then she said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This do I, dog, for the husband of whom thou hast robbed me,&rsquo; and
    then there came a flash and a cry, and the white man sprang to his feet and
    fell forward on his face&mdash;dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Tui ran from the house. She fled from her father and came towards
    the village, and Tepuaka the King followed her with death in his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kill her!&rsquo; he called to the men of Niuafou.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then we men of Anuda sprang to her aid with our clubs in our
    hands, and she ran into our midst and called to us to save her from her father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So there was much talk, and then her father&rsquo;s wrath began to
    subside, for we made him many presents of food for his journey back, and
    he went away in peace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is all. And see, Jaojai, hither comes thy wife with her son
    in her arms to welcome thee home.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGallantGoodRiou"></a>&ldquo;The Gallant, Good Riou&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>This is a true story of one of Nelson&rsquo;s captains, he of whom Nelson
    wrote as &ldquo;the gallant and good Riou&rdquo;&mdash;high meed of praise
    gloriously won at Copenhagen&mdash;but Riou, eleven years before that day,
    performed a deed, now almost forgotten, which, for unselfish heroism, ranks
    among the brightest in our brilliant naval annals, and in the sea story of
    Australia in particular.</p>
  <p>In September, 1789, the <i>Guardian</i>, a forty-gun ship, under the command
    of Riou, then a lieutenant, left England for the one-year-old penal settlement
    in New South Wales. The little colony was in sore need of food&mdash;almost
    starving, in fact&mdash;and Riou&rsquo;s orders were to make all haste to
    his destination, calling at the Cape on the way to embark live stock and
    other supplies. All the ship&rsquo;s guns had been removed to make room for
    the stores, which included a &ldquo;plant cabin&rdquo;&mdash;a temporary
    compartment built on deck for the purpose of conveying to Sydney, in pots
    of earth, trees and plants selected by Sir Joseph Banks as likely to be useful
    to the young colony&mdash;making her deck &ldquo;a complete garden,&rdquo; says
    a newspaper of the time. Friends of the officers stationed in New South Wales
    sent on board the Guardian great quantities of private goods, and these were
    stored in the gun-room, which it was thought would be a safer place than
    the hold, but, as the event proved, it was the most insecure.</p>
  <p>The ship arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in November, and there filled
    her decks with cattle and provisions, then sailed again, her cargo being
    equal in value to about &pound;70,000. On December 23rd&mdash;twelve days
    after leaving the Cape&mdash;what is described as &ldquo;an island of ice&rdquo; was
    seen. Riou gave orders to stand towards it in order to renew, by collecting
    lumps of ice, the supply of water, the stock of fresh water having run very
    low in consequence of the quantity consumed by the cattle.</p>
  <p>The <i>Public Advertiser</i> of April 30, 1790, describes what now happened.
    As the ship approached the island, the boats were hoisted out and manned,
    and several lumps collected. During this time the ship lay to, and on the
    ice being brought on board she attempted to stand away. Very little apprehension
    was at this time entertained of her safety, although the enormous bulk of
    the island occasioned an unfavourable current, and in some measure gave a
    partial direction to the wind. On a sudden, the base of the island, which
    projected under water considerably beyond the limits of the visible parts,
    struck the bow of the ship; she instantly swung round, and her head cleared,
    but her stern, coming on the shoal, struck repeatedly, and the sea being
    very heavy, her rudder broke away, and all her works abaft were shivered.
    The ship in this situation became, in a degree, embayed under the terrific
    bulk of ice, for its height was twice that of the mainmast of a ship of the
    line, and the prominent head of the berg was every moment expected to break
    away and overwhelm the ship. At length, after every practicable exertion,
    she was got off the shoal, and the ice floated past her. It was soon perceived
    that the <i>Guardian</i> had six feet of water in her hold, and it was increasing
    very fast The hands were set to the pumps, others to find out the leaks,
    and they occasionally relieved each other. Thus they continued labouring
    unceasingly on the 24th, although on the 23rd not one of them had had the
    least rest The ship was at one period so much relieved that she had only
    two feet of water in the hold; but at this time, when their distress wore
    the best aspect, the water &ldquo;increased in a moment to ten feet.&rdquo; Then
    the ship was discovered to be strained in all her works, and the sea running
    high, every endeavour to check the progress of a particular leak proved ineffectual.
    To lighten the ship, the cows, horses, sheep, and all the other live stock
    for the colony were, with their fodder, committed to the deep to perish.</p>
  <p>John Williams, boatswain of the <i>Guardian</i>, wrote to his parents in
    London, and told them about the disaster, and although we have no doubt he
    was handier with the marline-spike than with his pen, some of his badly spelled
    letter reads well:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;This axident happened on the 23rd of December, and on the 25th the
    boats left us with moast of the officers and a great part of the seamen.
    The master-gunner, purser, one master&rsquo;s mate, one midshipman, and a
    parson, with nine seamen, was got into the longboat and cleared the ship.
    The doctor and four or five men got into a cutter and was upset close to
    the ship, and all of them was drowned. As for the rest of the boats, I believe
    they must be lost and all in them perished, for wee was about six hundred
    leagues from any land. There was about fifty-six men missing; a number drowned
    jumping into the boats; the sea ran so high that the boats could scarce live.
    The commander had a strong resulution, for he said he would sooner go down
    in the ship than he wold quid her. All the officers left in the ship was
    the commander, the carpenter, one midshipman, and myself. After the boats
    left us we had two chances&mdash;either to jump or sink. We cold just get
    into the sailroom and got up a new forecourse and stuck it full of oakum
    and rags, and put itt under the ship&rsquo;s bottom; this is called fothering
    the ship. We found some benefit by itt for pumping and bailing we gained
    on hur; that gave us a little hope of saving our lives. We was in this terable
    situation for nine weeks before we got to the Cape of Good Hope. Sometimes
    our upper-deck scuppers was under water outside, and the ship leying like
    a log on the water, and the sea breaking over her as if she was a rock. Sixteen
    foot of water was the common run for the nine weeks in the hold. I am not
    certain what we are to doo with the ship as yet. We have got moast of our
    cargo out; it is all dammaged but the beef and pork, which is in good order.
    I have lost a great dele of my cloaths, and I am thinking of drawing of about
    six pound, wich I think I can make shift with. If this axident had not hapned
    I shold not have had aney call for aney. As for my stores, there is a great
    part of them thrown overboard; likewise all the officers stores in the ship
    is gone the same way, for evry thing that came to hand was thrown ovarboard
    to lighten the ship. I think that we must wait till ordars comes from England
    to know what we are to do with the ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chronicles of the time also relate how at daylight on Christmas morning,
    when the water was reported as being up to the orlop deck and gaining two
    feet an hour, many of the people desponded and gave themselves up for lost.
    A part of those who had any strength left, seeing that their utmost efforts
    to save the ship were likely to be in vain, applied to the officers for the
    boats, which were promised to be in readiness for them, and the boatswain
    was directly ordered to put the masts, sails, and compasses in each. The
    cooper was also set to work to fill a few quarter-casks of water out of some
    of the butts on deck, and provisions and other necessaries were got up from
    the hold.</p>
  <p>Many hours previous to this, Lieutenant Riou had privately declared to his
    officers that he saw the final loss of the ship was inevitable, and he could
    not help regretting the loss of so many brave fellows. &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; said
    he, &ldquo;I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to
    make my presence useful as long as there is any occasion for it.&rdquo; He
    was entreated, and even supplicated, to give up this fatal resolution, and
    try for safety in the boats. It was even hinted to him how highly criminal
    it was to persevere in such a determination; but he was not to be moved by
    any entreaties. He was, notwithstanding, as active in providing for the safety
    of the boats as if he intended to take the opportunity of securing his own
    escape. He was throughout as calm and collected as in the happier moments
    of his life.</p>
  <p>At seven o&rsquo;clock the <i>Guardian</i> had settled considerably abaft,
    and the water was coming in at the rudder-case in great quantities. At half-past
    seven the water in the hold obliged the people below to come upon deck; the
    ship appeared to be in a sinking state, and settling bodily down; it was,
    therefore, almost immediately agreed to have recourse to the boats. While
    engaged in consultation on this melancholy business, Riou wrote a letter
    to the Admiralty, which he delivered to Mr. Clements, the master. It was
    as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;H.M.S<i>. Guardian, </i>Dec.
    25, 1789.<br>
  &ldquo;If any part of the officers or crew of the<i> Guardian </i>should ever
  survive to get home, I have only to say their conduct, after the fatal stroke
  against an island of ice, was admirable and wonderful in everything that relates
  to their duty, considered either as private men, or in His Majesty&rsquo;s
  service. As there seems to be no possibility of my remaining many hours in
  this world, I beg leave to recommend to the consid&eacute;ration of the Admiralty
  a sister, who, if my conduct or service should be found deserving any memory,
  their favour might be shown to, together with a widowed mother.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am, &amp;c,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Phil. Stephens, Esq.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;E.
Riou.</p>
  <p>With the utmost difficulty the boats were launched. After they were got
    afloat and had cleared the ship, with the exception of the launch they were
    never afterwards heard of; the launch with nine survivors was picked up by
    a passing vessel ten days after she left the wreck, her people reduced to
    the last extremity for want of food and water.</p>
  <p>Among the survivors was the parson mentioned by the boatswain. This was
    the Rev. Mr. Crowther, who was on his way as a missionary to the penal settlement.
    The Rev. John Newton, of Olney (poet Cowper&rsquo;s Newton), had got Crowther
    the appointment, at &ldquo;eight shillings per diem, of assistant chaplain
    of the settlement,&rdquo; and Newton, writing to the Rev. R. Johnson, chaplain
    of Sydney, tells how he heard of the loss of the <i>Guardian</i>, &ldquo;and
    the very next morning Mr. Crowther knocked at my door himself.&rdquo; Then
    Mr. Newton writes a letter which shows that Mr. Crowther had had enough of
    the sea. &ldquo;It is not a service for mere flesh and blood to undertake.
    A man without that apostolic spirit and peculiar call which the Lord alone
    can give would hardly be able to maintain his ground. Mr. Crowther, though
    a sincere, humble, good man, seems not to have had those qualifications,
    and therefore he has been partly intimidated by what he met with abroad,
    and partly influenced by nearer personal considerations at home, to stay
    with us and sleep in a whole skin.&rdquo; But after his experience it was
    not to be wondered at that he preferred to stay at home and sleep in a whole
    skin.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Riou, in spite of a ship without a rudder, and with the water
    in her up to the orlop deck, succeeded, as the boatswain&rsquo;s letter shows,
    after a voyage of nine weeks, in bringing his command to the Cape. A letter
    from Capetown, written on March 1, 1790, tells us she arrived there &ldquo;eight
    days ago in a situation not to be credited without ocular proofs. She had,
    I think, nine feet of water in her when she anchored. The lower gun-deck
    served as a second bottom; it was stowed with a very great weight equally
    fore and aft. To this, and to the uncommon strength of it, Captain Riou ascribes
    his safety. Seeing an English ship with a signal of distress, four of us
    went on board, scarcely hoping but with busy fancy still pointing her out
    to be the <i>Guardian</i>, and, to our inexpressible joy, we found it was
    her. We stood in silent admiration of her heroic commander (whose supposed
    fate had drawn tears from us before), shining through the rags of the meanest
    sailor. The fortitude of this man is a glorious example for British officers
    to emulate. Since that time we have gone on board again to see him. He is
    affable in his manners, and of most commanding presence.... Perhaps we, under
    the influence of that attraction which great sufferings always produce, may,
    in the enthusiasm of our commendation, be too lavish in his praise; were
    it not for this fear I would at once pronounce him the most God-like mortal
    I ever viewed. They were two months from the time the accident happened until
    they reached this place. Every man shared alike in the labour; and not having
    at all attended to their persons during the whole of that dismal period they
    looked like men of another world&mdash;long beards, dirt, and rags covered
    them. Mr. Riou got one of his hands crushed and one of his legs hurt, but
    all are getting well. None of his people died during their fatigues. He says
    his principal attention was to keep up their spirits and to watch over their
    health. He never allowed himself to hope until the day before he got in here,
    when he made the land. Destitute of that support, how superior must his fortitude
    be! He has this morning, for the first time, come on shore, having been employed
    getting stores, &amp;c., out to lighten the ship. He wavers what to do with
    her&mdash;whether to put Government to the expense of repairing her here
    (which would almost equal her first cost, perhaps exceed it) or burn her.
    Most likely the last will be resolved on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ship was in such a state that she was condemned by the experts at the
    Cape, but Riou, bearing in mind the distressed state of the colony of New
    South Wales, did not rest until he had sent on in other vessels all the stores
    he could collect.</p>
  <p>Neither did he forget the behaviour of certain convicts. In a letter to
    the Admiralty he wrote: &ldquo;Permit me, sir, to address you on a subject
    which I hope their Lordships will not consider to be unworthy their notice.
    It is to recommend as much as is in my power to their Lordships&rsquo; favour
    and interest the case of the twenty convicts which my duty compelled me to
    send to Port Jackson. But the recollection of past sufferings reminds me
    of that time when I found it necessary to make use of every possible method
    to encourage the minds of the people under my command, and at such time,
    considering how great the difference might be between a free man struggling
    for life and him who perhaps might consider death as not much superior to
    a life of ignominy and disgrace I publicly declared that not one of them,
    so far as depended on myself, should ever be convicts. And I may with undeniable
    truth say that, had it not been for their assistance and support, the <i>Guardian</i> would
    never have arrived to where she is. Their conduct prior to the melancholy
    accident that happened on December 23rd last was always such as may be commended,
    and from their first entrance into the ship at Spithead they ever assisted
    and did their duty in like manner as the crew. I have taken the liberty to
    recommend them to the notice of Governor Phillip; but I humbly hope, sir,
    their Lordships will consider the service done by these men as meriting their
    Lordships&rsquo; favour and protection, and I make no doubt that should I
    have been so fortunate as to represent this in proper colours, that they
    will experience the benefit of their Lordships&rsquo; interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The prisoners were pardoned, and the Secretary of the Admiralty wrote to
    Riou&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have their Lordships&rsquo; commands to acquaint you that their
    concern on the receipt of the melancholy contents of the first-mentioned
    letter could only be exceeded by the satisfaction they received from the
    account of your miraculous escape, which they attribute to your skilful and
    judicious exertions under the favour of Divine Providence.... Their Lordships
    have communicated to Mr. Secretary Grenville, for his Majesty&rsquo;s information,
    your recommendation of the surviving convicts whose conduct, as it has so
    deservedly met with your approbation, will, there is every reason to hope,
    entitle them to his Majesty&rsquo;s clemency.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>[This story of the gallant behaviour of these twenty prisoners does not
    stand alone in the convict annals of Australia. There were many other instances
    in which convicts behaved with the greatest heroism. Many of the earlier
    explorers, such as Sturt, received most valuable aid from prisoners who were
    members of their expeditions; and in the first days of the colony both Phillip
    and Hunter were quick to recognise and personally reward or recommend for
    pardon to the Home Government convicts who had distinguished themselves by
    acts of bravery.]</p>
  <p>When Riou returned to England he was promoted to post-captain&rsquo;s rank,
    and at Copenhagen, in 1801, he commanded the <i>Amazon</i>. Perhaps we may
    be forgiven for reprinting from Southey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nelson&rdquo; an account
    of what he did there. &ldquo;The signal&rdquo;  (that famous one which Nelson
    looked at with his blind eye), &ldquo;the signal, however, saved Riou&rsquo;s
    little squadron, but did not save its heroic leader. The squadron, which
    was nearest the commander-in-chief, obeyed and hauled off. It had suffered
    severely in its most unequal contest. For a long time the <i>Amazon</i> had
    been firing enveloped in smoke, when Riou desired his men to stand fast,
    and let the smoke clear off, that they might see what they were about. A
    fatal order, for the Danes then got clear sight of her from the batteries,
    and pointed their guns with such tremendous effect that nothing but the signal
    for retreat saved this frigate from destruction. &lsquo;What will Nelson
    think of us!&rsquo; was Riou&rsquo;s mournful exclamation when he unwillingly
    drew off. He had been wounded in the head by a splinter, and was sitting
    on a gun, encouraging his men, when, just as the <i>Amazon</i> showed her
    stern to the Trekroner Battery, his clerk was killed by his side, and another
    shot swept away several marines who were hauling in the main-brace. &lsquo;Come,
    then, my boys!&rsquo; cried Riou, &lsquo;let us die all together!&rsquo; The
    words had scarcely been uttered before a raking shot cut him in two. Except
    it had been Nelson himself, the British Navy could not have suffered a severer
    loss.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSouthSeaman"></a>The South Seaman</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">An Incident In The Sea Story Of Australia</p>
  <p>On the 22nd of July, 1828, the Sydney South Seaman, <i>Indefatigable</i>,
    eleven days out from the Port of Conception in Chili, was in lat 17&deg; S. and
    about 127&deg; E. long., six hundred miles distant from the nearest land&mdash;the
    then almost unknown Paumotu Group, which Cook had well named the Dangerous
    Archipelago.</p>
  <p>Five years before, the brig was named the <i>Calder</i>, and was then commanded
    by Captain Peter Dillon, a famous officer in the East India Company&rsquo;s service;
    his name is interwoven with the sea story of Australia as the commander of
    the Company&rsquo;s ship <i>Research</i>, and the discoverer of the relics of the
    gallant and ill-fated La Perouse, whose ships were wrecked on Vanikoro Island,
    in the New Hebrides group, in 1788.</p>
  <p>When the <i>Calder</i> was under the command of Captain Dillon she was a
    crack Indian trader to Port Jackson, but newer and smarter vessels drove
    her out of the trade; and in 1828 she was owned by Mr. John Duncan, an English
    merchant of Valparaiso, who for this present voyage had loaded her with wheat
    for Sydney, and sent her to sea under the command of Mr. Joseph Hunter, after
    changing her name to <i>Indefatigable</i>.</p>
  <p>The first and second mates of the brig were Europeans, as also were two
    or three of the crew&mdash;the rest were Chilenos, picked up at the last
    moment of sailing. The steward was a Bengali, a man devoted to his captain,
    with whom he had long sailed in other seas. The Chilenos were not alone lazy
    and incompetent seamen, not fit to keep a look-out, nor take the wheel in
    rough weather, but what was worse, they were treacherous scoundrels, as ready
    for murder with their long, ugly sheath-knives, as British merchant sailors
    are with their fists for honest fighting.</p>
  <p>Naturally enough, with such men as these the mates frequently quarrelled,
    and on one or two occasions the officers were driven to resort to blows to
    maintain proper discipline. And a Chileno, or any other Spanish South American,
    never forgives a blow, though a knife-thrust or a pistol-shot in the dark
    would not be considered anything else than proper to vindicate wounded honour.
    But the mates of the <i>Indefatigable</i> were simple-minded, rough British
    seamen. They wanted the Chilenos to work the ship like sailormen should work
    a ship&mdash;the Chilenos hated work of any kind, and especially hated the
    steady discipline of this English merchant ship&mdash;the officers of which,
    when necessity demanded it, would rout out the watch below and send them
    aloft to shorten sail. And so, in less than a week from the day the brig
    sailed from Conception, mutiny and murder was plotted in the foc&rsquo;s&rsquo;cle by
    the Chilenos, But none of the Englishmen on board had any thought of danger.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Mr. Loftgreen, the chief mate, had the middle watch. It was a marvellously
    clear and starlight night, with just enough wind astern to keep the brig&rsquo;s
    light canvas full and give her steerage way. As the officer slowly paced
    the short poop, he with difficulty resisted the soothing lullaby of the murmur
    of the water as it rippled past the ship&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>On the foc&rsquo;s&rsquo;cle, one of the Chileno sailors, named Antonio Mancillo, kept
    the watch, and just as Loftgreen, overcome by the stillness of his surroundings,
    had stopped his walk and was leaning on the rail at the break of the poop,
    almost dozing&mdash;good seaman as he was&mdash;he heard the Chileno cry
    out sharply&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is an island close ahead!&mdash;Come for&rsquo;ard, Senor Loftgreen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mate ran hastily forward, but as he reached the short ladder which led
    to the topgallant foc&rsquo;s&rsquo;cle, two Chilenos, each carrying a cutlass, sprang
    upon and seized him by the arms, while Mancillo held the point of a knife
    to his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, you Ingleese dog! If you speak, you die now; we shall kill you,&rdquo; said
    one of the mutineers in a fierce whisper.</p>
  <p>Loftgreen, a tough, wiry young fellow, struggled desperately, and freeing
    his right arm struck one of the Chilenos a blow that sent him down as if
    he had been shot, and cried out loudly, &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mutiny!&rdquo;,
    Mancillo meanwhile making savage thrusts at him with his knife, and the other
    man trying to run him through with his cutlass; but the mate, unarmed as
    he was, was able to cope with them both, for tripping up Mancillo he struck
    him on the chest so violently that he fell against the man with the cutlass.</p>
  <p>Then the mate took to his heels and ran aft, calling loudly for assistance.
    The disturbance, so far, had scarcely lasted two minutes, and those of the
    ship&rsquo;s company who were not on deck knew nothing of what had happened.</p>
  <p>Loftgreen, notwithstanding that he was wounded and bleeding in the right
    arm, and half-dazed from a somewhat severe cut on the head, succeeded in
    reaching his cabin, where he seized a pair of pistols, and still crying loudly
    to his sleeping fellow-officers, prepared to defend himself to the last.
    Unfortunately his pistols were not loaded, and in his hurry and confusion
    he could not find his bullet bag.</p>
  <p>Just then the Bengali steward, awakened by the noise, came running up the
    companion way, and was met by one of the mutineers&mdash;the helmsman&mdash;who
    struck him to the deck by a blow on the shoulder from a cutlass.</p>
  <p>Captain Hunter, awakened from his slumber by the stamping of feet and the
    outcry, guessed what had happened. Quickly seizing his pistols, and buckling
    on his sword (in those days merchant captains always possessed swords, for
    they had use for them sometimes) he ran out of his cabin, just as the mutineers
    reached the door. He discharged both pistols together, but unfortunately
    was too excited to take aim, and neither shot had any effect, but for a little
    while he kept the Chilians at bay with his sword, until covered with wounds
    he staggered; in an instant one of them darted in upon him, and a cutlass
    was thrust through his heart.</p>
  <p>Then the mutineers again turned their attention to the gallant mate, who
    was unable to get out of his cabin, one of the attacking party having turned
    the key from the outside. The cabin lamp had been knocked over in the struggle,
    and the darkness made the murderers careful of their movements, for they
    were afraid that Loftgreen might force his door and burst out upon them,
    and after a hurried discussion they ran on deck.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Mr. Todd, the second mate, aroused by the cries and shots in the
    main cabin, jumped out of his bunk, and trying to open his cabin door, found
    it was fastened from the outside. Throwing himself against it, he burst it
    open at the same moment as the wounded steward crawled past upon his hands
    and knees. Unable to speak, the Bengali placed a cutlass in the officer&rsquo;s
    hands, and pointed to the hacked and bleeding body of the dead captain, just
    discernible in the darkness. Todd at once secured Hunter&rsquo;s pistols, and Loft-green
    at the same moment burst the door of his cabin and came out, and the two
    men, who had no time for words, prepared to sell their lives dearly, believing
    that those of the crew who might have been loyal had been slaughtered. For
    some minutes they stood waiting in the darkness, and heard no sound but the
    moans of the steward, who was fast weakening from loss of blood.</p>
  <p>Then came a sudden rush down the companion-way, and the Chilenos, with savage
    cries, were upon them! Poor Loftgreen&rsquo;s pistols were in bad order, and missed
    fire, and although the two men fought desperately with their empty weapons
    they were soon overpowered, and with the steward were taken on deck and lashed
    to the poop stanchions. Exhausted and bleeding profusely, they presently
    saw some of the mutineers emerge from the cabin, dragging with them Captain
    Hunter&rsquo;s body, which they at once threw overboard.</p>
  <p>Before these events had taken place the Chilians had quietly secured the
    fore-scuttle, battening down the carpenter, cook, and three other European
    seamen, so that even before Loftgreen was attacked the ship was practically
    in the hands of the six mutineers, for the man at the wheel was one of their
    number.</p>
  <p>Leaving the two officers and the steward guarded by two men, the remaining
    four mutineers, after heaving-to the brig, went below to the bloodstained
    cabin, and breaking open the spirit-locker began a carousal which lasted
    some hours, to the accompaniment of music on Mancillo&rsquo;s guitar. They took
    care, however, to relieve the two sentinels, and kept themselves sober enough
    to shorten sail if it became necessary.</p>
  <p>At daylight, after giving all their prisoners food, the mutineers held a
    consultation as to their future proceedings, and at noon, in pursuance of
    their design, they hoisted out the longboat, and placed in her a couple of
    breakers of water, a bag of biscuit, and a few pieces of salt meat.</p>
  <p>Then Loftgreen and the second mate were liberated, and the former taken
    below. Seated at the cabin table were Mancillo and three of his fellow-ruffians.</p>
  <p>As soon as the chief officer entered Mancillo rose, and drawing a loaded
    pistol from his belt he pointed to a large sheet of paper lying on the table,
    and ordered Loftgreen to make a rough chart showing the course and distance
    to the nearest land, adding, &ldquo;You see that we have now got this brig.
    You are the only man on board who can navigate her. You must stay with us,
    for we want you to sail the ship to Manila. The other men we shall put in
    the longboat, and this chart you will draw will be good enough for them to
    reach the nearest land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The nearest land! Good God! it is inhabited by ferocious cannibals
    who will eat them! You cannot be so inhuman!&rdquo; said the mate.</p>
  <p>Mancillo laughed cruelly&mdash;&ldquo;Let them be eaten! so much the better
    for us. When they are dead they cannot talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then let me share their fate, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The leader of the mutineers placed the muzzle of his pistol against Loftgreen&rsquo;s
    chest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be silent, you damned Ingleese dog! Be silent, and do what I tell
    you, or by the Holy Virgin, I kill you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thereupon the mate, notwithstanding his wounded arm, and with his thoughts
    distracted by the fate before him, not only made a good chart, but he did
    more; for it suddenly flashed upon him that in all probability neither Mancillo
    nor any of his fellow-ruffians could read English, so after finishing the
    drawing he turned to Mancillo and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Todd is an ignorant man, and this chart will be of no use to him
    unless I can give him directions how to steer. Will you let me do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered the mutineer, quickly, &ldquo;you must not speak
    to him again, nor to any of the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you will. Poor fellows; I can do no more, but at least I can write
    on the back of the chart and tell Mr. Todd the prevailing directions of the
    winds, the courses to be steered, and the name of the least savage of the
    islands he can make for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then coolly turning the chart over, he scribbled a few lines upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;read that; you will see that that can
    do no harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mancillo looked critically at the writing for a few minutes, and Loftgreen&rsquo;s
    heart thumped against his ribs as he watched. Then a sigh of relief burst
    from him as the mutineer spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are not murderers, and do not mind for you to give the second mate
    the good directions. But if you are lying to us we shall have your life for
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These were the words he had written: &ldquo;Not allowed to speak or write.
    Coast the islands, all are dangerous till you reach Otaheite. Am forced to
    navigate the mutineers to Manila, I will try to retake the ship, as I think
    I can gain over Jose and the cook, and then make for Otaheite. Have patience,
    and trust in God always.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Loftgreen was then again placed in irons, and one of the mutineers stood
    sentry in the cabin over him, while Mancillo and the rest went on deck and
    set about disposing of the remaining prisoners, Mr. Todd was the first man
    ordered into the boat, which had now been lowered and brought alongside.
    Then Mancillo handed him the chart and a compass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the mutineer, &ldquo;we give you fine chart, just
    made for you by the mate. You see he has write out for you your course, so
    you will soon make the land.&rdquo; Then he added with a grin&mdash;&ldquo;Is
    not Antonio Mancillo damn good fellow, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Poor Todd looked at the chart, and then at the writing at the back of it,
    and miserably anxious and dejected as he was, he found it hard to resist
    smiling at the clever way in which his fellow-officer had got to windward
    of the Chileno. However, he pulled a long face, and said there was mighty
    little chance of reaching anywhere but a savage island, with such a poor
    chart as that. &ldquo;What,&rdquo;  he added angrily, &ldquo;is the good of
    this writing? We could find a cannibal island without this,&rdquo; and he
    contemptuously flung the chart into the stern sheets of the boat.</p>
  <p>Then, one by one, the wounded steward, the carpenter, and a Swedish seaman
    whose name is not recorded, were brought on deck and forced, at the point
    of cutlasses, to enter the boat, which was then cast adrift.</p>
  <p>As the boat dropped astern, Mancillo ran up a flag of some description,
    and the remaining mutineers gathered on the poop and jeered at Todd and his
    companions; their insulting cries and mocking words reaching the ears of
    the half-maddened Loftgreen in the cabin, and reminding him that he was alone
    and at the mercy of utter scoundrels, with any one of whom his life was not
    worth a moment&rsquo;s purchase.</p>
  <p>But although they were not manacled, the second mate and his companions
    in the boat were in little better plight, for their distance from the nearest
    land they could hope to make was nearly six hundred miles. But Todd was no
    faint-heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better the open sea, my lads,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than the brig and
    those damned Spanish cut-throats. We are at least free men. Poor Mr. Loftgreen,
    I fear, will be murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then after dressing the steward&rsquo;s wound&mdash;a cutlass slash which
    had severed the collar-bone&mdash;he ordered the sail to be hoisted and took the
    tiller. This done he steered a due west course, which according to the mate&rsquo;s
    chart would bring them to the easternmost of the Faumotus&mdash;a group of
    low-lying islands almost unknown in those days except to American whale-ships.</p>
  <p>In the boat were sufficient biscuits, salt beef, and water to last them,
    with great economy, for a fortnight The boat itself was a good one, and they
    were provided with a compass and a course to be steered. The men were on
    good terms with each other and loyal and submissive to their officer; so
    they had much to be thankful for, and their chief sorrow in leaving the brig
    was their fears for the safety of Loftgreen, who had always been a kind
    and considerate officer.</p>
  <p>For fifteen days the boat sailed before light breezes, till on August 7th
    they made Tawere Island in the Paumotus Archipelago (named by Cook &ldquo;Resolution
    Island&rdquo; after his ship) almost in the centre of the vast group, having
    passed without sighting them many other low-lying atolls which lay in their
    course on the starboard hand. To their joy the brown-skinned natives of Tawere
    behaved very kindly to them, for several whale-ships, and, later on, the
    missionaries of the London Missionary Society&rsquo;s ship, had visited their island,
    and the people were well-disposed to white men. The island afforded but little
    in the way of food&mdash;only fish, pigs, cocoanuts, and a coarse species
    of taro, but of these the people were profuse in their presents to the white
    men.</p>
  <p>Only remaining a day and a night at Tawere, Todd bade farewell to the amiable
    natives, and continued on his course, sighting many other islands of the
    group, but calling at none. Then came a heavy gale from the south, and he
    had to let the boat run right before it to the north. The sea was short and
    lumpy, and only continuous bailing kept her from filling.</p>
  <p>Early on the morning of the 15th further misfortunes overtook them; a sudden
    squall sprung the mast, although the sail was close reefed. Then the rudder
    gudgeons carried away, and the boat broached to and shipped a heavy sea,
    which with other damage tore the compass from the after-thwart, where it
    had been placed, and completely smashed and rendered it useless. A few hours
    later, however, the weather cleared, the gale died away, and the gentle south-east
    trade again breathed upon them. That evening they made Anaa (Chain Island),
    the natives of which, owing to previous association with South Seamen&mdash;as
    whaling and trading ships were then called&mdash;were very good to them.
    At Anaa, Todd and his comrades remained for two days, and on the morning
    of the 20th day they sighted the noble outlines of Tahiti, the Garden of
    the South Pacific.</p>
  <p>Here they thought their troubles were ended, for the natives of Tahiti were
    known to not only be friendly to white men, but Christianised as well.</p>
  <p>But as soon as the sea-worn men approached the beach, numbers of canoes,
    filled with natives armed with muskets, put off, and surrounding the boat,
    made the white men prisoners.</p>
  <p>Greatly alarmed at this proceeding&mdash;which was such a contrary reception
    to what they had expected from the Tahitians&mdash;Todd at first imagined
    he had lost his reckoning and arrived at some strange island But some of
    the natives spoke a little English, and very soon their conduct was explained
    to the white men.</p>
  <p>Some months previously a party of escaped convicts had arrived at the island
    in a small schooner, which they had seized at Van Dieman&rsquo;s Land (Tasmania).
    In bringing the vessel to an anchor the convicts lost her on the reef, and
    their lives had been saved by the Tahitians. The strangers were hospitably
    received, but their degraded natures were soon made evident They broke into
    a chief&rsquo;s house, stole food, arms, and ammunition, placed them in a boat
    belonging to the local white missionaries, and ran away with her. A party
    of Tahitians gave chase, and were fired upon by the convicts, who killed
    four of their number and badly injured their canoe, so that the remainder
    had the greatest difficulty in reaching the land again.</p>
  <p>Todd and his companions were thought to be another party of convicts, and
    the queen and chiefs of the island gave orders that they should be kept close
    prisoners.</p>
  <p>But this additional misfortune was soon over, for as the boat, escorted
    by the canoes, entered Papeite Harbour Mr. Todd saw lying at anchor the London
    South Seaman <i>Tiger</i>, Captain Richards. This vessel had been at Conception
    at the same time as the <i>Indefatigable</i>, and the officers of each ship
    had met. In the course of an hour or so Todd saw Captain Richards and told
    his story, and then the misunderstanding with the Tahitians was cleared up
    and the second mate and his companions supplied with every comfort A week
    later the <i>Tiger</i> sailed for Sydney, taking the four men with her.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile what had become of the <i>Indefatigable</i>, and how fared poor
    Loftgreen with the mutineers?</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>As soon as the longboat was clear of the brig the mutineers released the
    mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We now want the brig navigated to Guam&rdquo; (one of the Ladrone Islands),
    said Mancillo to Loftgreen; &ldquo;I am captain now, and you must do as I
    bid you. Beware of a mistake. If you take the ship out of her course we will
    serve you as we served Captain Hunter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So the voyage, which lasted until the 12th of December, began. The life
    led by the men in the longboat was easy enough compared with the terrible
    months of mental torture endured by the unfortunate mate. Only that fine
    weather prevailed the whole time, the brig would most assuredly have been
    lost, for the mutineers were utterly without discipline, and would only furl,
    or set, or trim the sails just as the humour took them. Every night Loftgreen
    was put in irons and left to himself till daylight.</p>
  <p>There was a considerable supply of wine and spirits on board, and four out
    of the six Chilians were continuously drunk. Then these four vowed that it
    was essential to the success of their enterprise that Loftgreen should be
    murdered. The two men who did not drink were more prudent ruffians, and knew
    that without their navigator they were helpless, and so they protected him.</p>
  <p>Very often Loftgreen, who had a fair knowledge of Spanish, had to stand
    in the midst of the Chilenos whilst he was taking observations, and listen
    to them debating as to whether they should take his life at once or spare
    him until they reached Guam. And it was only the heroic resolve to save the
    ship for his owners that prevented him from trying to escape in a small quarter-boat,
    or attempting to kill the mutineers in their sleep, and let the brig drift
    about the Pacific till he was sighted by another ship.</p>
  <p>He soon found out that the mutineers had no idea that Guam was actually
    settled by the Spaniards. It is probable that they knew that Guam was owned
    by Spain, but no doubt thought that the island was inhabited only by natives,
    like Saipan and Rota in the same group. One of the two mutineers, who entertained
    friendly feelings towards him, told him that Mancillo&rsquo;s idea was to sell
    the brig to the islanders in return for liberty to lead his ideal of life&mdash;eating,
    drinking, sleeping, and keeping an extensive harem on one of the many islands
    in the North Pacific.</p>
  <p>At last the brig arrived at Port San Luis d&rsquo;Apra, in Guam, and a native
    pilot brought her to an anchor. One of the mutineers remarked to Mancillo
    that he supposed they were safe, &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, pointing to some
    houses ashore,  &ldquo;those are not native houses; there are Europeans living
    here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A boat was lowered, and Mancillo, after dressing himself in Captain Hunter&rsquo;s
    best clothes, was rowed ashore by two of his fellow-mutineers to see what
    the place was like. To their intense surprise they found awaiting them the
    Alcalde of San Luis, and a lieutenant and guard of Spanish soldiers.</p>
  <p>The Alcalde questioned them closely as to who they were, and what had brought
    them to Guam. Their replies did not satisfy the official, who, placing Mancillo
    in custody and taking half a dozen soldiers with him, made the two Chilenos
    row him off to the ship.</p>
  <p>On seeing the soldiers approach, the remaining mutineers, cowards as they
    were, concluded that their shipmates had betrayed them, and ran below to
    hide themselves, leaving Mr. Loftgreen on deck to receive the Alcalde, who
    was soon in possession of the whole story. Unlike most Spanish officials,
    he did not want a bribe to ensure his performance of his duty. He promptly
    seized the <i>Indefatigable</i>, and the Chilenos were taken ashore and marched
    to the fort under guard. Then the Alcalde and Governor, with much formality,
    held a court, and took the mate&rsquo;s evidence; the result of which was the mutineers
    were placed in heavy irons, and the almost heart-broken Loftgreen was received
    in the Governor&rsquo;s house as an honoured guest and supplied with every comfort.</p>
  <p>Soon afterwards the <i>Rainbow</i>, a British frigate commanded by Captain
    Rous, put into San Luis d&rsquo;Apra. The <i>Rainbow</i> had made many important
    discoveries in Australian waters, more particularly on the northern coast,
    but the name of her gallant commander will probably be longer remembered
    as Admiral Rous, the famous turf patron, than as Captain Rous the explorer
    and navigator.</p>
  <p>Mr. Loftgreen was received on board the <i>Rainbow</i> as English naval
    officers always receive a brave and distressed merchant seaman. The mutineers
    were handed over to the British captain for conveyance to Manila for trial.
    The frigate arrived at Manila on January 19th, and there the Chilenos had
    short shrift, for within three days they were brought to trial and duly garrotted.</p>
  <p>Mr. Loftgreen, who made many friends in Manila, was afforded a passage to
    Sydney, and the <i>Indefatigable</i> was condemned as a prize to the Spanish
    Government She was afterwards lost in a typhoon in the China Sea.</p>
  <p>Such is one of the many incidents of the sea story of Australia.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="FostersLetterOfMarque"></a>Foster&rsquo;s Letter Of Marque</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>I</b></h3>
  <p>One by one the riding-lights of the few store-ships and whalers lying in
    Sydney Harbour on an evening in January, 1802, were lit, and as the clear
    notes of a bugle from the barracks pealed over the bay, followed by the hoarse
    calls and shrill whistles of the boatswains&rsquo; mates on a frigate that
    lay in Sydney Cove, the mate of the <i>Policy</i> whaler jumped up from the
    skylight where he had been lying smoking, and began to pace the deck.</p>
  <p>The <i>Policy</i> was anchored between the Cove and Pinchgut, ready for
    sea. The north-easter, which for three days had blown strongly, had now died
    away, and the placid waters of the harbour shimmered under the starlight
    of an almost cloudless sky. As the old mate tramped to and fro on the deserted
    poop, his keen seaman&rsquo;s eye caught sight of some faint grey clouds
    rising low down in the westward&mdash;signs of a south-easterly coming before
    the morning.</p>
  <p>Stepping to the break of the poop, the officer hailed the look-out forward,
    and asked if he could see the captain&rsquo;s boat coming.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;I did see a boat a while
    ago, and thought it was ours, but it turned out to be one from that Batavian
    Dutchman anchored below Pinchgut. Her captain always goes ashore about this
    time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swinging round on his heel with an angry exclamation, the mate resumed his
    walk, muttering and growling to himself as elderly mates do mutter and growl
    when a captain promises to be on board at five in the afternoon and is not
    in evidence at half-past seven. Perhaps, too, the knowledge of the particular
    cause of the captain&rsquo;s delay somewhat added to his chief officer&rsquo;s
    ill-temper&mdash;that cause being a pretty girl; for the mate was a crusty
    old bachelor, and had but little sympathy with such  &ldquo;tomfoolery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why the devil couldn&rsquo;t he say goodbye to her and be done with
    it and come aboard,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;instead of wasting half a
    day over it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Mr. Stevenson did not consider that in those days pretty women were
    not plentiful in Sydney, and virtue was even scarcer than good looks, and
    Dorothy Gilbert, only daughter of the Deputy Acting Assistant Commissary-General
    of the penal settlement, possessed all the qualifications of a lovable woman,
    and therefore it was not wonderful that Captain Charles Foster had fallen
    very much in love with her.</p>
  <p>Dorothy, of course, had her faults, and her chief one was the rather too
    great store she set upon being the daughter of an official. Pretty nearly
    every one in those days of the settlement was either an official or a prisoner
    or an ex-convict, and the D.A.A.C.G. was of no small importance among the
    other officials in Sydney. The girl&rsquo;s acquaintance with the young master
    of the <i>Policy</i> began in a very ordinary manner. His ship had been chartered
    by the Government to take out a cargo of stores to the settlement, and the
    owners, who were personally acquainted with her father, had given Foster
    a letter of introduction. This he had used somewhat sooner than he had at
    first intended, for on presenting himself at the Commissary&rsquo;s office
    he had caught sight of Dolly&rsquo;s charming face as she stood talking to
    a young man in the uniform of a sergeant of the New South Wales Regiment
    who had brought a letter to her father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sergeant,&rdquo; the young lady said with a gracious smile. &ldquo;Will
    you present my father&rsquo;s compliments to the Major and say we shall be
    sure to come. He is not here at present, but cannot delay long, as he will
    have much business to transact with the master of the ship just come in,
    and who will doubtless be here very soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just at that moment Foster appeared at the open door, and the young lady,
    divining at once that he was the person of whom she had just spoken, bowed
    very prettily, and begging him to be seated whilst she had search made for
    her father, left the office and disappeared in the living portion of the
    house, followed by a look of very great interest from Captain Foster. A minute
    later the Commissary entered the room, and Foster was soon deep in business
    with Dolly&rsquo;s father, to whom he made himself very agreeable&mdash;having
    a certain object in view.</p>
  <p>Their business concluded, the young man rose to go, and not till then&mdash;being
    wise in his generation&mdash;did he allude to the fact of his having a private
    letter of introduction from his owners&mdash;Messrs. Hurry Brothers, of London&mdash;to
    Mr. Scarsbrook. The stiff, official manner of the D.A.A.C.G. at once thawed,
    and being at heart a genial old fellow, he expressed his pleasure, shook
    hands again with the young man, and inquired why he had not presented the
    letter or made allusion to it before.</p>
  <p>Foster, who had pretty well gauged Mr. Scarsbrook mentally, modestly replied
    that he did not care to obtrude private affairs at an inopportune time. He
    knew that weighty affairs doubtless occupied Mr. Scarsbrook&rsquo;s mind
    during his business hours, but had intended to do himself the honour of presenting
    his letter later on, &amp;c.</p>
  <p>This at once impressed the D.A.A.C.G., who asked him to dinner that evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A most intelligent young man, my dear,&rdquo; he told Dolly shortly
    after.  &ldquo;His attention to business before all else has given me a very
    favourable impression of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dolly tossed her head. &ldquo;I hope I shall not be disappointed in him.
    Is he young?&rdquo; she asked indifferently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite; and in manners and appearance much above his position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dolly did like him very much&mdash;much more than she cared to confess
    to herself&mdash;and their first meeting at dinner led to many of a less
    formal character, and ere a week had passed Captain Charles Foster was very
    much in love with his host&rsquo;s daughter, and not being a man who wasted
    time, was only awaiting an opportunity to tell her so.</p>
  <p>Now Dolly, who had first flirted with and then flouted every one of the
    bachelor officials in Sydney, military or civilian, who visited the Commissary&rsquo;s
    abode, was, to do her justice, a girl of sense at heart, and she felt that
    Captain Foster meant to ask her an all-important question&mdash;to every
    woman&mdash;and that her answer would be &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; For not only
    was he young, handsome, and highly thought of by his owners, but he came
    of a good family, and had such prospects for his future as seldom came in
    the way of men in the merchant service even in those days of lucky South-Seamen
    and East India traders, who made fortunes rapidly. And then &rsquo;twas evident
    he was very much in love with her, and this latter fact considerably and
    naturally influenced her.</p>
  <p>The first week passed pleasantly enough, then, to his anger and disgust,
    Foster found he had a rival; and before the end of the second week he realised,
    or imagined so, that he was beaten in the field of love&mdash;by a Dutchman!</p>
  <p>Sergeant Harry Burt was the first to give him warning, for he was often
    on duty at or near the Commissary&rsquo;s quarters, and, indeed, had often
    taken notes from Foster to the fair Dolly. He showed a warm interest in the
    matter, for Foster was always polite to the sergeant, and did not turn up
    his nose at &ldquo;soldier men,&rdquo;  as other masters of ships were but
    too ready to do.</p>
  <p>It had so happened that the work of discharging his ship had kept Foster
    very busy during the second week of his stay, and he had paid but one evening
    visit to Dolly and her father, and was hurrying the cargo ashore with feverish
    eagerness. Once that was accomplished, he meant to devote himself (1) to
    proposing to the young lady, (2) gaining her father&rsquo;s consent, and
    (3) getting to sea again as soon as possible, making a good cruise at the
    whale fishery, and returning to Sydney within two years as master and owner
    of a ship of his own. Consequently, Burt&rsquo;s news gave him considerable
    disquietude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who did you say he was, Sergeant?&rdquo; he asked gloomily; &ldquo;a
    Dutchman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; he&rsquo;s the master of that Dutch Batavian ship that
    has brought stores from Batavia. Mr. Scarsbrook seems to make a lot of him
    of late, and he&rsquo;s always coming up to the Commissary&rsquo;s place.
    And if he sees Miss Scarsbrook out in the garden he swaggers in after her
    as if he were an admiral of the fleet Portveldt&rsquo;s his name, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what, Sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I think Miss Scarsbrook rather likes him, that&rsquo;s all.
    You see, sir, you haven&rsquo;t been there for a week, and this young Dutchman
    is by no means bad-looking, and even our Major says he&rsquo;s a jolly fine
    fellow&mdash;and all that goes a long way with women, you know. Then you
    only visit the house once in a week; the Dutchman goes there every day, and
    every time he comes he brings his boatswain with him&mdash;a big, greasy-faced
    chap. Last night he followed his master, carrying a cheese&mdash;a present
    for the Commissary, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I shall soon see how the land lies, Sergeant I&rsquo;m going
    ashore presently, and I can promise you it won&rsquo;t be my fault if I let
    this fellow get to windward of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Miss Dolly was not to be seen that day, nor yet on the following one.
    She was vexed at Foster having thought of his work before herself, and she
    had determined to punish him by not meeting him for some little time, and
    amuse herself with the handsome young Dutch sailor meanwhile. So, in no very
    amiable mood, Foster went back to his ship, finished discharging, and delighted
    his old mate by telling him to get ready for sea as quickly as possible.
    And on this particular evening when our story opens the <i>Policy</i> only
    waited for her captain&mdash;who had gone ashore&mdash;so he told Stevenson&mdash;to
    say goodbye to the Commissary, with parting instructions to the mate to begin
    to heave up as soon as he saw his (Foster&rsquo;s) boat leave the Cove.</p>
  <p>After spending half an hour with the Commissary, Foster asked to see Miss
    Dorothy, and was soon ushered into the sitting-room, where the young lady
    welcomed him effusively, and her manner soon drove all suspicious thoughts
    of his rival out of his mind. Her mother, a placid lady, who was absolutely
    ruled by Dolly and her father, smiled approval when Foster asked her daughter
    to accompany him to the garden and take a look at the harbour. She liked
    him, and had previously given him much assistance by getting out of the way
    whenever she suspected he wanted to see Dolly alone.</p>
  <p>As soon as they had gained the screen of the shaded path leading to the
    water&rsquo;s edge, Foster came to the point at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know why I have asked you to come
    with me here. My ship is ready for sea, and it may be quite two years before
    I shall have the happiness of seeing you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very kind of you to pay me so pretty a compliment, Captain
    Foster&mdash;or I should say Mr. Foster,&rdquo; said Dolly, concealing a
    smile; &ldquo;but surely you need not have brought me out to the garden to
    tell me this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her pretended forgetfulness of some past passages in their brief acquaintance,
    as her speech implied, ruffled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very particular with your <i>Mr</i>. Foster, Miss Dolly;
    and why not &lsquo;Captain&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dolly raised her eyebrows in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captains hold the King&rsquo;s commission and fight for their country,&rdquo;  she
    said demurely. &ldquo;The master of a horrid ship that goes catching whales
    has no right to the title.&rdquo; Then she laughed and shook her long, fair
    curls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon my word, young lady, you are very complimentary; but, Dolly,
    no more of this banter. My boat is waiting, and I have but a few minutes
    to ask you to give me your answer. In all seriousness remember that my future
    depends upon it. Will you marry me? Will you try to love me? May I go away
    with the hope that you will look forward to my return, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In all seriousness, Mr. Foster, I will not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what have I done to offend you? I thought you&mdash;I thought
    that I&mdash;&rdquo; and then, getting somewhat confused and angry
    at the same time at Dolly&rsquo;s nonchalant manner, he wound up with, &ldquo;I
    believe that damned Dutchman has come between us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How dare you swear at me, sir? I suppose, though, it is the custom
    for captains in the merchant service to swear at ladies. And what right have
    you to assume that I should marry you? Because I rather liked to talk to
    you when I felt dull, is that any reason why you should be so very rude to
    me? And once for all, sir, I shall never marry a mere merchant sailor&mdash;a
    common whaling master. I shall marry, when I do marry, an officer and a gentleman
    in the King&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Foster snapped, &ldquo;and what about the Dutchman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now up to this point Dolly had been making mere pretence. She honestly loved
    the young seaman, and meant to tell him so plainly before he left the garden,
    but at this last question the merriment he had failed to see in her eyes
    gave place to an angry sparkle, and she quickly retorted&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Portveldt, sir, is a Dutch gentleman, and he would never talk
    to me in such a way as you have done. How dare you, sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Foster was really angry now, and smiled sarcastically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    but the master of a merchantman, and an infernal Dutchman at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is a gentleman, which you are not!&rdquo; snapped Dolly fiercely; &ldquo;and
    if he is but a merchant skipper, he commands his own ship. He is a shipowner,
    and a well-known Batavian merchant as well, sir; so there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I believe,&rdquo; said Foster wrathfully; &ldquo;sells Dutch cheeses
    and brings them ashore with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a spy,&rdquo; said Dolly contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Scarsbrook, call me what you please. I can see your
    cheese merchant waddling this way now, attended by his ugly pirate of a boatswain.
    Doubtless he has some stock-fish on this occasion, and as stock-fish are
    very much like Dutchmen in one respect and I like neither, I wish you joy
    of him. Goodbye!&rdquo;  And Captain Foster swung on his heel and walked
    quickly out of the garden gate. As he strode down the narrow path he brushed
    past the Batavian merchant, who was on his way to the Commissary&rsquo;s
    office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goot tay to you, Captain Foster,&rdquo; said Port-veldt, grinning
    amiably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; replied the Englishman promptly, turning
    round and facing the Dutchman to give due emphasis to his remark.</p>
  <p>Portveldt, a tall, well-made fellow, and handsomely dressed, stared at Foster&rsquo;s
    retreating figure in angry astonishment, then changing his mind about first
    visiting the Commissary, he opened the garden gate, and came suddenly upon
    Dorothy Scarsbrook seated upon a rustic bench, weeping bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My tear yong lady, vat is de matter? I beg you to led me gomfort
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing the matter, Mr. Portveldt I thank you, but you cannot
    be of any service to me,&rdquo; and Dolly buried her face in her handkerchief
    again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry ferry mooch to hear you say dat, Mees Dorotee, vor it
    vas mein hop dot you would dake kindtly to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dolly made no answer, and then Captain Portveldt sat down beside her, his
    huge figure quite filling up all the remaining space.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mees Dorotee,&rdquo; he began ponderously, &ldquo;de trood is dot
    I vas goming to see you to dell you I vas ferry mooch in loaf mid you, und
    to ask you to be mein vifes; but now dot you do veep so mooch, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say no more if you please, Mr. Portveldt,&rdquo; said Dolly, hastily
    drying her eyes. Then, rising with great dignity, she bowed and went on: &ldquo;Of
    course I am deeply sensible of the great honour that you do me, but I can
    never be your wife.&rdquo;  And then to herself: &ldquo;I fancy that I have
    replied in a very proper manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vy, vat vas der wrong aboud me, Mees Dorotee?&rdquo; pleaded Portveldt &ldquo;I
    vas feery yoyful in mein mind tinking dot you did loaf me some liddle bid.
    I have mooch money; mein haus in Batavia is mosd peautiful, und you shall
    have plendy servands to do all dot you vish. Oh, Mees Dorotee! vat can be
    wrong mid me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing that I object to in you, sir, except that I do not
    love you. Really you cannot expect me to marry you because I have seen you
    half a dozen times and have treated you with politeness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do hobe, Mees Dorotee, dot id is not because of dot yong mans who
    vas so oncivil to me yoost now dot you vill not haf me. He vas dell me to
    go to der tuyvel ven I did say &lsquo;goot morning&rsquo; yoost now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is no young man, sir. Mr. Foster is a person for whom I have a
    great regard, but I do not intend to marry him. I will only marry a gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, bud, Mees Dorotee, am I not a yentle-mans?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not consider masters of merchantmen gentlemen,&rdquo; replied
    Dolly with a slight sniff. &ldquo;My father is an officer in the King&rsquo;s
    service, and I have been taught to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! Mees Dorotee,&rdquo; laughed Portveldt good-humouredly, &ldquo;dot
    is nod so. Your baba is but a gommissary who puys de goots vich I bring me
    from Batavia to sell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How dare you talk like that, sir? My father <i>is</i> a King&rsquo;s
    officer, and before he came here he fought for his country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil, Mees Dorotee, I do beg your pardon mooch, and I vill vight
    vor mein country if you vil learn to loaf me on dot account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Miss Dolly would listen no more, and, with a ceremonious bow, walked
    away. Then the Dutch merchant went to the Commissary&rsquo;s office to talk
    the matter over with her father, who told him that he would not interfere
    in his daughter&rsquo;s choice; if he could not make himself agreeable to
    her, neither her father nor mother could help him.</p>
  <p>Just after sunrise next morning, Dolly, who had spent the night in tears
    and repentance, woke, feeling very miserable. From her opened window she
    could see the morning mists hanging over the placid waters of the harbour
    disappearing before the first breaths of the coming south-easter. The <i>Policy</i>,
    she thought, could not have sailed yet, and she meant to send her lover a
    note, asking him to come and see her again before he left. Then she gave
    a little cry and sob, and her eyes filled with tears. Far down the harbour
    she could see the sails of the <i>Policy</i> just disappearing round a wooded
    headland.</p>
  <p>An hour or so after breakfast, as Dolly was at work among her flowers, the
    tall figure of Sergeant Burt stood before her, and saluted&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The <i>Policy</i> has sailed, Miss Scarsbrook,&rdquo; said the Sergeant,  &ldquo;and
    I have brought you a letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Dolly, with an air of icy indifference, turning
    her back upon the soldier, and digging her trowel into a little heap of soil. &ldquo;I
    do not take any interest in merchant ships, and do not want the letter.&rdquo; When
    she glanced round again she was just in time to see Sergeant Burt standing
    in the roadway with a lot of tiny pieces of paper fluttering about his feet.</p>
  <p>Something impelled her to ask: &ldquo;What are you doing, Burt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Foster&rsquo;s orders, Miss. Told me if you would not take the
    letter I was to destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dolly laid her trowel down and slowly went to her room &ldquo;with a bad
    headache,&rdquo; as she told her mother.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>II</b></h3>
  <p>Nearly two years went by, and then one morning the look-out at the South
    Head of Sydney Harbour signalled a vessel to the north-east, and a few hours
    later the <i>Policy</i> was again at anchor in Sydney Cove, and Captain Foster
    was being warmly welcomed by the residents generally and Dolly&rsquo;s father
    in particular, who pressed him to come ashore that evening to dinner.</p>
  <p>Among the first to board the <i>Policy</i> was Sergeant Burt, who, as soon
    as the others had left, was in deep converse with Captain Foster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    sure she meant to take your letter, Mr. Foster,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;and
    that I was too quick in tearing it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon know, Burt; I&rsquo;ll try again this evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the Commissary&rsquo;s dinner that evening Dolly met him with a charming
    smile and cheeks suffused; and then, after Captain Foster had narrated the
    incidents of his successful whaling voyage, her parents discreetly left them
    to themselves in the garden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolly! I am a rough, uncultured sailor. Will you therefore forgive
    me my rudeness when we last parted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course. I have forgotten it long ago, and I am very sorry we parted
    bad friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You make me very happy, Dolly. I have been speaking to your mother,
    and she has told me that she thinks you do care for me, Is it so? May I again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Captain Foster, why cannot we be friends without&mdash;without
    anything else. I will not pretend that I do not understand your meaning,
    but I tell you, once and for all, I don&rsquo;t want to be married. Really,&rdquo; and
    she smiled brightly,  &ldquo;you are as bad as Mr. Portveldt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Dorothy,&rdquo; said Foster with annoying equanimity, &ldquo;I
    won&rsquo;t allude to the subject again. But what has the Dutchman been doing?
    Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dolly laughed merrily. &ldquo;Oh, Captain Foster, I really have no right
    to show you this letter, but it is so very amusing that I cannot help doing
    so,&rdquo;  and she took a letter from her pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he has been writing to you, has he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t speak in that bullying manner, sir, or I shall not
    let you hear its contents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Dolly; but how came you to get the letter? We are at war
    with the Dutch Settlements now, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is the amusing part of it. Now listen, and I will read it to
    you;&rdquo; and Dolly spread out a large sheet of paper, and read aloud in
    mimicking tones&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Mein dear Mees Dolly,&mdash;You did vant ein loafer who could vight
    vor his coundry, and vould haf no man who vas yoost ein merchant. Very goot.
    I mineself now command the privateer <i>Swift</i>, vich vas used to be sailing

    your loafing Richard Portveldt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Foster jumped to his feet &ldquo;The rascally Dutch swab, to dare to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To dare to write to me,&rdquo; said Dolly laughingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To dare to write to you! To suppose for one moment that you&mdash;oh,
    d&mdash;  the fellow! If I come across him, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But all the same, he&rsquo;s very brave,&rdquo; said Dolly demurely; &ldquo;he
    is fighting for his country, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boasting fool!&rdquo; ejaculated Foster contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he <i>is</i> captain of the <i>Swift</i>, and the <i>Swift</i> <i>did</i> beat
    some of the English ships. I have heard my father say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Three privateers did manage to cut off some of our little
    despatch vessels in the Channel; but this fat Dutchman, Portveldt, had no
    hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this &lsquo;fat Duchman, Portveldt,&rsquo; <i>did</i> capture the <i>Mary
      Ann</i>, and her master <i>did</i> give me this letter, and&mdash;and I
      was <i>so</i> angry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The master of the <i>Mary Ann</i> must have been a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why so&mdash;for merely executing a commission? But wait, there is
    a postscript that will interest you particularly. Now listen while I read
    it,&rdquo; and Dolly, again mimicking Portveldt&rsquo;s English, read&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Dell dot oncivil yong mans Voster who vas dell me to go to ter tuyvel,
    dot I vill sendt der <i>Bolicy</i> und her master mit der grew to der tuyvel
    if he gomes mein vay mit his zeep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Captain Foster, what do you think of that, pray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very pretty talk; what do <i>you</i> think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m only a poor little woman; but if I were a man I would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly so, Dolly. Well, I am a man, and the <i>Policy</i> has brought
    a letter of marque with her from England this time, and so I may meet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Foster!&rdquo; and Dolly&rsquo;s eyes brightened, &ldquo;I <i>am</i> glad;
    but&mdash;but&mdash;<i>please</i>, for my sake, don&rsquo;t get killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A fortnight later, when Foster bade Dolly goodbye for another six months,
    she told him softly that she would be glad&mdash;oh, so very glad!&mdash;to
    hear news of him. A whaling voyage was so very dangerous, and he might get
    hurt or killed.</p>
  <p>And this time, as the <i>Policy</i> sailed and Foster saw Dolly waving to
    him from the steps of the Commissary&rsquo;s office, he felt pretty sure
    that the letter of marque had advanced his suit considerably.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Fourteen days out from Sydney the <i>Policy</i> took her first whale, greatly
    to the delight of old Stevenson and the crew, who looked upon such early
    luck as a certain indication of a good cruise. After &ldquo;trying-out&rdquo; Foster
    kept on to the northward to the sperm-whaling grounds in the Moluccas. Three
    days later they spoke the <i>Endicott</i>, of Nantucket, whose captain gave
    Foster a kindly warning not to go cruising further north, for there were
    several Batavian privateers looking out for the English whalers that were
    then due on the cruising ground. Then the American wished him luck and goodbye.</p>
  <p>Old Stevenson&rsquo;s face fell; then he swore. &ldquo;I suppose we have
    to turn tail, sir, and try what we can do to the southward and I believe
    we&rsquo;d be a full ship in three months or less up in the Moluccas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do I, and I&rsquo;m going there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s dangerous waters, sir; we don&rsquo;t want to lose
    the ship and rot in prison in Batavia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Stevenson, I am an Englishman, and Hurry Brothers did not get
    a letter of marque for this ship for nothing. You ought to know that to turn
    back means an empty ship. It is our duty to go to our proper cruising ground
    and cruise till we are a full ship; and all the infernal Dutchmen in the
    world mustn&rsquo;t frighten us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said the old mate cheerfully, &ldquo;but,
    all the same, I don&rsquo;t want us to get served like that fellow Portveldt
    served the old <i>Mary Ann</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another five weeks passed. So far, &ldquo;greasy&rdquo; luck had attended
    the <i>Policy</i> for she had taken sixteen more sperm whales, the last of
    which was killed in about 8&deg; S. and 120&deg; E., in the Flores Sea. But
    misfortune had come upon the ship in other respects, and Foster was in no
    small anxiety about his crew, nearly all of whom were ill from lead-poisoning.
    This had been brought about by drinking water from leaden tanks in which
    oil had once been stored.</p>
  <p>A bright look-out was kept, for the ship was now right in the spot where
    it was likely she might meet with the Dutch privateers.</p>
  <p>It was Stevenson&rsquo;s watch, and as he walked the poop he stopped suddenly,
    for the look-out reported a sail to the W.S.W. Foster came on deck at once
    and went aloft In a quarter of an hour it was evident that the stranger bore
    towards them. The wind was south-east, and very little of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked the mate. &ldquo;I fancy this
    is one of the Dutchmen who are on the look-out for us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; answered Foster, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what
    I am going to do: brace sharp up on the larboard tack and run down to her.
    I am not going to run away from <i>one</i> infernal Dutchman, and I can only
    see one of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re captain of the ship, and you can do as you please; but
    I am hanged if I think you&rsquo;ll pull it off this time. Half the crew
    are sick, and this fellow looks as if he meant fighting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All hands on deck; starboard forebrace!&rdquo; was all the answer
    Foster made. Then he went to the signal locker, and getting out the American
    ensign, with his own hands ran it up to the peak, hoping by this means to
    get close enough to the other ship to prevent <i>her</i> from running away
    from a fight, if the captain should turn out not one of the fighting sort.</p>
  <p>As soon as the sails were trimmed the skipper walked to the break of the
    poop, and, with the air of a captain of a seventy-four, gave the order, &ldquo;Clear
    ship for action!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the mate ventured to remark that half of the guns were down below on
    the &lsquo;tween decks, where they had been put out of the way for the generally
    peaceful occupation of whaling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, get &rsquo;m up. What the devil do you think I mean by clearing
    for action?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Accordingly, the six-pounders were hoisted upon deck and quickly mounted,
    what little powder and shot the <i>Policy</i> carried was brought into a
    handy place, and the mate, with something of a smile, reported, &ldquo;Ship
    cleared for action, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, Mr. Stevenson. Now, my lads, I reckon this ship is one
    of the Dutch fleet sent to clear us whalers out of these seas. Well, as he
    seems to be alone, I think we have a fair chance of turning the tables upon
    him. Anyhow, I am going to try. I know some of you are pretty sick, but I
    am sure that a crew of English sailors, even when they are sick, can lick
    twice their number of muddle-headed Dutchmen any day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In those days, British ships were manned by British seaman, and Captain
    Foster could talk like this without saying anything offensive to the British
    merchant service. Nowadays such an observation about &ldquo;Dutchmen&rdquo; would
    be a personal insult to four-fifths of the crew of a British merchant ship.</p>
  <p>The men, including the mate, received the speech with a cheer, and one of
    them sang out &ldquo;Haul down the Stars and Stripes. We don&rsquo;t want
    to fight under that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To which Captain Foster, who knew what he was about, merely replied,  &ldquo;I
    am not a fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Towards the close of the afternoon the ships were within gunshot of each
    other, and the Dutchman ran up his colours. As they drew closer, the foreign
    skipper&rsquo;s glass showed him the nationality of the <i>Policy</i> and
    he at once opened fire upon her with one of his six eighteen-pounders.</p>
  <p>As the shot hummed overhead between the <i>Policy&rsquo;s</i> fore and main
    masts, down came the American colours and up went the British ensign, and
    at the same moment Foster fired such of his guns as bore upon the enemy.</p>
  <p>As soon as the report of the guns had died away, Foster sprang into one
    of his quarter-boats and hailed the other ship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ship ahoy!&rdquo; he roared &ldquo;why do you fire at me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! I know you,&rdquo; came back in mocking tones. &ldquo;Now
    vill I sendt you to der tuyvel, you greasy valer mans. I am Captain Portveldt,
    und dis is der <i>Swift</i>. Vill you surrunder, or vill I smash you to beices?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For answer, Foster, who had now come very close to his enemy, fired his
    tiny broadside, his men, sick as they were running cheerfully from the guns
    to the braces to manoeuvre the <i>Policy</i> clear of the privateer&rsquo;s fire,
    and then back again to the guns.</p>
  <p>The sun had now set, but far into the darkness of the tropical night the
    running fight continued, Foster always out-manouvring the Dutchman, and the
    crews of both vessels, when they closed near enough to be heard, cursing
    and mocking at each other. Owing to the darkness and the extremely bad gunnery
    on both sides, little blood was spilt, and the damage done was mostly confined
    to the sails and rigging. Now and then a eighteen-pound shot hulled the <i>Policy</i>,
    and one went clean through her amidships. Suddenly, for some cause or other,
    about midnight, a light was shown in the privateer&rsquo;s stern, and Foster&rsquo;s
    second mate at once sent a lucky shot at it, with the result that the six-pound
    ball so damaged the <i>Swift&rsquo;s</i> rudder that she became unmanageable.
    And then, a few minutes later, another shot dismounted one of her guns by
    striking it on the muzzle, and ere the Dutchman&rsquo;s crew knew what was
    happening, a final broadside from the whaler brought down her two topsails
    and did other damage aloft. That practically ended the battle.</p>
  <p>So thought Captain Portveldt, who now hailed the <i>Policy</i> in not quite
    so boastful a voice as when the vessels met earlier in the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Voster, I haf hauled down mein flag. Mein grew will vight
    no more, and I must surrender.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A cheer broke from the whaler&rsquo;s crew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Captain Portveldt,&rdquo; called out Foster; &ldquo;lower
    a boat, and come on board with half your crew. But don&rsquo;t try on any
    boarding tricks, or you will be the worse for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The meeting between the two skippers, notwithstanding the cause, was good-humoured
    enough, for Portveldt, apart from his boastfulness, was not a bad fellow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil, Captain Voster,&rdquo; he said as he stepped on board the <i>Policy&rsquo;s</i> deck,
    followed by his big boatswain (who was wounded in the face by a splinter)
    and half his crew, &ldquo;you haf broved der besd mans; und now I suppose
    you vill lead me like a liddle dog mit a sdring, und dake me to Sydney und
    make vun mit der young lady about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered Foster, &ldquo;I am not so bad as all that
    Come below and have a glass of grog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>At daylight one morning some weeks later two ships appeared in sight off
    Sydney Heads. Those who were on the look-out were alarmed, for it was seen
    that both vessels were armed, and it was conjectured that the ships must
    be part of an enemy&rsquo;s squadron which had determined to make an attack
    upon the settlement of Port Jackson.</p>
  <p>In a very short time an excited crowd gathered together along the line of
    cliffs of the outer South Head, each one asking his fellow what was to be
    done. Horsemen carried the news into Sydney, and every moment fresh numbers
    arrived to swell the crowd of spectators on the cliffs. A strange sight they
    must have presented, comprising, as they did, all sorts and conditions of
    men&mdash;settlers, naval and military officers, soldiers of the New South
    Wales Regiment, and a number of the better class of convicts.</p>
  <p>Of course the Deputy Acting Assistant Commissary-General was among the officers
    anxiously watching the ships from the heights that overlooked the harbour,
    and with him were Dolly and her mother.</p>
  <p>Presently Dolly, catching sight of her father&rsquo;s anxious face, began
    to cry, and turned to her mother. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said &ldquo;it has
    all come true, and he has come to destroy the settlement!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has come true, and who is going to destroy the settlement?&rdquo; said
    her father sharply. And then Dolly, feeling very frightened and miserable,
    told him of Portveldt&rsquo;s letter, the receipt of which she had concealed
    from every one but Foster. The D.A.A.C.G. laughed at first, but then added, &ldquo;but
    all the same, though &rsquo;twas but empty bluster, I had better tell his
    Excellency about it; it is just possible that the Dutch have planned an expedition
    against us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At half-past ten, in response to a signal made from the look-out at South
    Head by the officer in charge there, his Excellency Governor King sent Lieutenant
    Houston, of his Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Investigator,</i> then anchored in
    Sydney Cove, to the naval officer in command at South Head.</p>
  <p>The <i>Investigator</i> was Flinders&rsquo; ship, the gallant old tub of
    334 tons which surveyed a great part of the northern coast, and was at the
    time of which we write lying rotting in Sydney, condemned after completing
    her second voyage of discovery in June, 1803.</p>
  <p>Then the Governor was told of Dolly&rsquo;s letter, but he was not the man
    to take fright at the approach of the enemy, although he had no defence force
    as it is now understood in New South Wales, nor had he a gold-laced staff
    of officers with elaborate &ldquo;defence schemes&rdquo; against possible
    raids of Japanese or Russians by way of Exmouth Gulf or Port Darwin.</p>
  <p>In that year Governer King&rsquo;s force did not take long to be marshalled.
    The drums beat to arms, and the New South Wales Corps and the Loyal Association
    immediately formed into line on the shores of the Cove.</p>
  <p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock a trooper arrived at Government House with intelligence
    that one of the vessels appeared under British colours, and the other was
    flying a Union Jack triumphant over a Dutch Jack. Following this message
    there soon came another, bringing the certain intelligence that one of the
    ships was an English whaler bringing into port her Batavian prize. So on
    receipt of this news, and just as the word to march was about to be given,
    the officer in command ordered his force to return to barracks.</p>
  <p>At two in the afternoon, with the whole of the settlement agog with excitement,
    the two vessels sailed slowly up the harbour before a light northeast breeze,
    and came to anchor in Sydney Cove, close to the <i>Investigator,</i> on board
    of which ship the Governor and a number of naval officers awaited their arrival.
    For once discipline was relaxed, and Captain King had good-naturedly permitted
    the townspeople to throng on board to learn all the news about the <i>Policy&rsquo;s</i> prize.
    As Captain Foster made his way to the quarter-deck, he saw that behind the
    Governor and his staff were Dolly and her parents and several ladies.</p>
  <p>In a very few minutes he made his report, and the Governor again shook his
    hand warmly; but the look in Dolly&rsquo;s eyes and the pressure of her hand
    were the young seaman&rsquo;s sweetest reward, for it told him that she had
    surrendered.</p>
  <p>Then, returning to his own ship, he was warmly greeted by Sergeant Burt,
    and for a few moments the two remained talking in the whaler&rsquo;s cabin.
    Then, just as Foster was ready to go ashore, Mr. Scarsbrook, who had been
    inspecting the captured privateer, came on board, bringing Dolly with him.</p>
  <p>Whilst they were all chatting merrily together Captain Portveldt made his
    appearance, and with the most perfect <i>sang-froid</i> saluted Dolly and
    her father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Veil, Mees Dorotee, you see I have gome back, at der bressing invidadion
    of mein goot friendt, Captain Voster here, und I do vish him mit you blendy
    of habbiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Dolly, who at first meant to meet him with a sarcastic little speech,
    felt her eyes fill with tears at the manly way in which he bore his misfortune,
    and could only falter out some few words of consolation. Then there was a
    Prize Court, and&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Mr. Charles Sparrow Foster, commander of the whaler and letter of
    marque called the <i>Policy</i>, presented to the Court a memorial stating
    his capture of the <i>Swift</i> on the 12th day of September, off the island
    of Flores, she being under Dutch colours... and the property of subjects
    of a Power at war with his Britannic Majesty, and praying also that the Court
    would be pleased to grant an award of condemnation in his favour in order
    that the said prize should be for the advantage of himself, his owners, and
    his ship&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>and the Court having heard confirmatory evidence from Richard Portveldt,
    a subject of the Batavian Republic, to the effect&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;That he commanded the <i>Swift</i>; that everything on board of her
    was Dutch property, and she belonged to Messrs. Winy and Talman, of Batavia,
    and himself, all of whom were residents of Batavia, who purchased her for
    the sum of 18,000 dols.: that she was taken up by the Dutch East India Company
    at Batavia; and was on her way thither when she was captured by the <i>Policy</i>, &amp;c.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
  <p>accordingly condemned the prize, which was advertised in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> for
    sale by auction, Mr. Lord, the auctioneer, setting forth that he would sell&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;At his warehouse, Sydney, at noon precisely, the 3rd of November,
    the good ship <i>Swift</i>, prize to <i>Policy</i>, Charles Foster, commander.
    French built in the year 1800. Was condemned a prize to his Majesty&rsquo;s
    ship <i>La Minerva</i>, and sold in 1801 to the Americans, as appears by
    the bill of sale, and by them sold to the Dutch at Batavia, where she was
    examined, copper-bolted, and new coppered in August, 1802. It is unnecessary
    to say anything respecting the properties of the <i>Swift</i> further than
    that she was the companion of <i>La Brave</i> and <i>La Mouche</i>, which
    so very much harassed the British in Europe, and set all our cruisers at
    defiance until her capture, prior to which she was justly celebrated as the
    fastest sailing-vessel the French Republic had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The prize was knocked down for &pound;3,000, and Captain Foster&rsquo;s
    share was spent in a handsome wedding present for Dolly, which, at her particular
    request, took the form of a passage to Batavia and a hundred guineas delivered
    to Captain Portveldt immediately after the marriage ceremony.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheAdventureOfElizabethMoreyOfNewYork"></a>The Adventure Of Elizabeth Morey, Of New York</b></h2>
  <p>In the sea story of Australia, from the days of Captain Phillip in 1788,
    to the end of the &ldquo;fifties&rdquo; in the present century, American
    ships and seamen have no little part. First they came into the harbour of
    Sydney Cove as traders carrying provisions for sale to the half-starved settlers,
    then as whalers, and before another thirty years had passed, the starry banner
    might be met with anywhere in the Pacific, from the sterile shores of the
    Aleutian Islands to the coasts of New Zealand and Tasmania.</p>
  <p>Early one morning in October, 1804, the American ship <i>Union</i> sailed
    in through Sydney Heads, and dropped anchor in the Cove. She was last from
    Tongatabu, the principal island of the Friendly Group. As soon as she had
    been boarded by the naval officer in charge of the port, and her papers examined,
    the master stated that he had had a very exciting adventure with the Tongatabu
    natives, who had attempted to cut off the ship, and that there was then on
    board a young woman named Elizabeth Morey, whom he had rescued from captivity
    among the savages.</p>
  <p>In a few minutes the young woman made her appearance in the main cabin,
    and was introduced to the officer. Her age was about six-and-twenty, and
    her manners &ldquo;extremely engaging;&rdquo; yet whilst she expressed her
    willingness to tell the story of her adventures among the islanders, she
    declined to say anything of her birth or parentage beyond the fact that she
    was a native of New York, and some years previously had made her way to the
    Cape of Good Hope.</p>
  <p>Her extraordinary narrative was borne out in all details as far as her rescue
    was concerned by the master of the <i>Union</i>, who, she said, had treated
    her with undeviating kindness and respect.</p>
  <p>This is her story:&mdash;</p>
  <p>In February of the year 1802, when she was living at the Cape of Good Hope,
    she made the acquaintance of a Captain Melton, the master of the American
    ship <i>Portland</i>. His dashing appearance, his command of apparently unlimited
    money, and his protestations of affection for the unfortunate girl soon led
    her to respond to his advances, and ultimately to consent to accompany him
    on a voyage to the islands of the South Pacific.</p>
  <p>After a prosperous voyage the <i>Portland</i> arrived at what is now known
    as Nukualofa Harbour, on the Island of Tongatabu. Within a few hours after
    anchoring, Captain Melton received a note from a white man named Doyle, who
    was the only European living on the island, asking him to come on shore and
    visit the chief, who particularly wished to see him and secure his aid in
    repelling an invasion from the neighbouring group of islands known as Haabai.
    Had Melton known that this man Doyle was an escaped convict from Van Dieman&rsquo;s
    Land, he would at least have been careful; had he known that the man was,
    in addition, a treacherous and bloodthirsty villain, he would have hove-up
    anchor, and, sailing away, escaped his fate. But Doyle, in his note, enumerated
    the advantages that would accrue to him (Melton) by assisting the chief,
    and the seaman fell into the trap. &ldquo;You must try,&rdquo; said the writer
    of the letter, &ldquo;to send at least one boat&rsquo;s crew well armed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Melton was a man with an elastic conscience. Without troubling his head
    as to the right or wrong side of this quarrel among savages, he promptly
    complied with the request of the beachcomber, and called for volunteers;
    the whole of the ship&rsquo;s company responded. The chief mate, Gibson,
    picked four men; Anderson, the second officer, eight men, and these were
    at once despatched on shore by the captain.</p>
  <p>The engagement came off on the following day, and the American allies of
    the chief (whom Miss Morey calls Ducara) inflicted fearful slaughter upon
    the enemy, and returned to the ship highly satisfied with themselves, and
    their native friends, who promised them every indulgence likely to gratify
    their tastes.</p>
  <p>In the evening Ducara himself came on board, and politely thanked the captain
    for his assistance. He slept all night in the cuddy, attended by Doyle, his
    minister of destruction, and took his leave early in the morning, promising
    to send ample refreshments on board in part return for favours received,
    and requesting that boats should be sent that evening to convey his gifts
    to the ship. Within a few hours after the chief had returned to the shore,
    many hundreds of stalwart natives were seen carrying baskets of provisions
    down to the beach, and piling them in heaps in readiness for the boats. Melton,
    at this stage, seemed to have some sort of suspicion in his mind about sending
    the boats ashore after dark, for he gave the mate instructions not to despatch
    them until he gave orders. The mate, however, who had been smitten by the
    beauty of a Tongan girl who had expressed her unqualified approval of his
    fighting capabilities in a very unconventional manner, had the utmost confidence
    in the good will of the natives, and took it upon himself to disobey his
    captain&rsquo;s commands; consequently two boats were sent off just as daylight
    was breaking, and whilst the skipper lay asleep in his cabin.</p>
  <p>Within a couple of hours the smaller of the two boats returned, loaded with
    yams, &ldquo;gnatu&rdquo; (tappa cloth), baked pigs, and fish. She was steered
    by the beachcomber, Doyle, and was rowed by two of the ship&rsquo;s boys,
    instead of the four men who had taken her ashore; these boys, it must be
    mentioned, had formed part of the crew of the larger boat, and had remained
    on the beach whilst the men had gone into the village at the invitation of
    Doyle and his fellow-conspirators. They, therefore, knew nothing of what
    had kept their shipmates from returning to the boats, when Doyle appeared
    and said he wished to go off to the ship, and that the others would follow
    later on.</p>
  <p>Accompanying the boat was a flotilla of canoes, filled with hundreds of
    savages, who were allowed to come alongside, though the girl Morey was so
    terrified by their savage aspect that she begged her lover to instantly recall
    the rest of his men and heave up anchor. Melton, however, although he was
    now in a state of suspense owing to the non-appearance of his boats&rsquo; crews,
    answered her calmly enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The two boys and Doyle say that the hands went up to the chiefs house
    to see a native dance,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll punish them for
    it when they return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the boat was unloaded, and again sent on shore with the two boys,
    and Doyle&rsquo;s native friends clambered up on board from any accessible
    part of the ship. The beachcomber himself, a wild-looking, dark-skinned ruffian,
    who had clothed himself in a shirt and trousers, now came aft and again assured
    the captain that he need feel no alarm at the great number of naked savages
    who now thronged the deck, from the windlass right aft to the wheel. Perhaps,
    however, the villain had some feeling of humanity in his vile heart, for
    seeing the terrified face of the girl Morey, he suggested that she should
    go below until the natives had returned to the shore.</p>
  <p>But so impressed was she with a sense of imminent peril that she refused
    to leave the poop, and begged Melton earnestly, &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake
    to take heed, and not thrust himself among the savages on the main deck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The beachcomber gave her a glance&mdash;half rage, half pity; then with
    his left hand he suddenly dashed her aside, and with a ferocious yell sprang
    at Melton and thrust a dagger into the throat of the unfortunate man. In
    an instant his savage followers began their work of slaughter, and Mr. Gibson,
    the chief mate, the boatswain, and four seamen were soon lying dead upon
    the bloodstained decks, their heads battered out of all human semblance by
    the clubs of the islanders.</p>
  <p>Two lads, Miss Morey, and her negro servant-woman, were spared, but hurried
    down below.</p>
  <p>The bodies of the murdered men were at once thrown overboard to the sharks
    by Doyle&rsquo;s orders, and he then directed the natives to clear the decks.</p>
  <p>Elizabeth Morey, terrified out of her senses at the dreadful scenes she
    had witnessed, attempted to spring overboard, but the beachcomber caught
    her as she came on deck, urged her not to be frightened, and promised her &ldquo;in
    the name of the Virgin&rdquo; that no harm should come to her. As soon as
    the decks had been ridden of all traces of the bloody work just completed,
    the half-unconscious girl was lifted over the side, placed in a canoe, taken
    on shore, and handed over to the care of a chiefs wife.</p>
  <p>When she came to her senses she learnt from Doyle that all who were left
    alive of the ship&rsquo;s company were herself and servant, a Malay seaman,
    five boys, and an old sailor, who was a dwarf; the latter had evidently been
    spared, either on account of the natives ranking him as a boy, or from their
    aversion to inflict injuries upon any one physically or mentally afflicted.</p>
  <p>The following three days were spent by the natives in unloading the ship,
    the work being carried on in the most systematic manner under the command
    of Doyle, the survivors of the crew being compelled to assist in the task.
    The cargo, which consisted mainly of bales of cotton, was got on shore in
    something less than a week; then the islanders began to dismantle the ill-fated
    ship. By the eighth day all the sails except the fore and main topsails were
    unbent and taken ashore.</p>
  <p>On the afternoon of this day but half a dozen natives were on board; they,
    with the five &ldquo;boys&rdquo; (probably lads under eighteen years of age),
    and the dwarf sailor before mentioned, were &ldquo;spelling&rdquo; for an
    hour or so before beginning to unbend the topsails, when, noticing that their
    captors were off their guard, the brave little man determined to retake the
    ship. In a few minutes he gained over his youthful shipmates to the attempt;
    they promised to stand by him to the last. Quietly arming themselves with
    axes, with iron belaying pins, with handspikes, with anything heavy and deadly
    they could lay their hands upon, they waited for the signal to begin the
    attack. Doyle, the bloodstained murderer, lay upon the skylight under the
    awning, half asleep and unsuspecting of danger; his native associates either
    slept or lounged about the main deck.</p>
  <p>A few hurried, whispered words passed between the six whites; then the dwarf,
    carrying an axe negligently in his hand, ascended to the poop and laid it
    down on the deck. Then he turned, and his quick seaman&rsquo;s eye took in
    the surroundings. The trade wind was blowing freshly, the ship (she was a
    full-rigged ship, though under five hundred tons), was straining at her hempen
    cable, and the low, palm-clad shore was nearly two miles away. He picked
    up the axe and running towards Doyle, buried the weapon to the head in his
    bosom!</p>
  <p>In less than five minutes the dreadful work was done, and Doyle and the
    six Tongans were weltering in their gore upon the very deck which was still
    stained by the traces of their own crimes. Before the natives on shore could
    realise what had happened, the cable was cut, the topsails loosed and sheeted
    home, and the <i>Portland</i> standing out to sea through the dangerous network
    of reefs which surrounded the harbour. Her recapture was a bloody deed, but
    the law of self-preservation is inexorable under such circumstances.</p>
  <p>Elizabeth Morey, aroused from a troubled slumber by the cries of her captors,
    came to the doorway of the chiefs house, and stood watching the ship, which,
    though only under her fore and main topsails, was fast slipping through the
    water. In two hours the <i>Portland</i> was safe, and the broken-hearted
    girl sank upon her knees and wept. She was now utterly alone, for her negro
    servant woman had gone on board the ship with Doyle to get some of her clothing,
    and had been carried off. The only remaining member of the <i>Portland&rsquo;s</i> crew
    was a Malay&mdash;a man of whom she had an instinctive dread; for, since
    the massacre of the ship&rsquo;s company he had one day asked her with a
    mocking grin if she could not &ldquo;clean his coat.&rdquo; His coat was
    Melton&rsquo;s white duck jacket, and the ensanguined garment brought all
    the horror of her lover&rsquo;s death before her again.</p>
  <p>Then followed fifteen long, long months of horror, misery, and agony. She
    was a woman, and her terrible fate evokes the warmest pity. Whatever may
    have been her past before she met Captain Melton and accompanied him on his
    fateful voyage, her sufferings during those fifteen dreadful months may be
    imagined but not written of nor suggested, except by the neurotic &ldquo;new
    woman&rdquo;  writer, who loves to dwell upon things vile, degrading, terrifying,
    and abhorrent to the clean and healthy mind.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>In August, 1804, the American whaler <i>Union</i>, of Nantucket, after having
    refreshed at Sydney Cove, as Port Jackson was then called, sailed on a sperm-whaling
    cruise among the South Sea Islands. She arrived at Tongatabu on the last
    day of September. As soon as the anchor was let go a fleet of canoes appeared,
    and the occupants made the most friendly demonstrations towards Captain Pendleton
    and his officers. In the leading canoe was a man whom the captain took to
    be a Malay, and upon being questioned this surmise proved to be correct.
    In broken English he informed Pendleton that the ship would be provided with
    plenty of fresh food, water, and wood, if the ship&rsquo;s boats were sent
    ashore. The captain&rsquo;s boat was thereupon swung out and lowered, and
    manned by six men, the captain and Mr. John Boston, the supercargo, going
    with them. These people were armed with six muskets and two cutlasses.</p>
  <p>As soon as the boat was well clear of the ship the natives became very troublesome,
    clambering up the chain plates, and forcing themselves on board in great
    numbers. The chief mate, Daniel Wright, seems to have shown more sense than
    most of the poor fools who, by their own negligence, brought about&mdash;and
    still bring about even to the present day&mdash;these South Sea tragedies.
    He got his men together and tried to drive off the intruders, but despite
    his endeavours thirty or forty of them kept to the deck, and their countrymen
    in the canoes alongside rapidly passed them up a number of war-clubs.</p>
  <p>Wright, with the greatest tact, and with apparently good-humoured force,
    at last succeeded in clearing the decks and bustling all the natives except
    the chief, over the side into their canoes. He (Wright) was a big, brawny,
    New Englander, had served in the American Navy before he had taken to whaling,
    and knew the value of coolness and discipline in an emergency, though he
    felt much inclined to pistol the chief, who all this time had been pretending
    to support his authority, though actually telling his people to be &ldquo;more
    patient, as the time had not yet come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This chief, whose name is not given in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of 1804,
    but who may have been the same &ldquo;Ducara&rdquo; of the <i>Portland</i> massacre,
    or one of Ducara&rsquo;s <i>matabulis</i>, at last took his leave with the
    usual protestations of regard so natural to even the present Christianised
    Tongan native of this year of grace 1900, when he means mischief, even in
    the minor matter of cheating or defrauding his white creditor. Descending
    into his canoe, he led the whole flotilla to the beach. Then the mate hoisted
    the ensign, and fired a gun as a warning to those of the ship&rsquo;s company
    on shore to return.</p>
  <p>No notice was taken of the signal, and presently through his glass Mr. Wright
    saw that the captain&rsquo;s boat was lying broadside on to the beach, surrounded
    by a crowd of islanders, and without a boat-keeper. This was sufficiently
    alarming. It was now late in the afternoon, and Captain Pendleton had been
    absent five hours. He at once came to the conclusion that the people who
    had gone ashore in the boat were either prisoners or had been murdered. To
    send another boat after them, he felt sure, would only lead to the destruction
    of the whole ship&rsquo;s company in detail, and the ultimate loss of the
    ship without there being the least chance of effecting any good. So he called
    the hands aft, explained the situation, and began to prepare to resist capture.
    All the available firearms were loaded, heavy stones which formed the ship&rsquo;s
    ballast, were placed along the waterways fore and aft in readiness to smash
    the canoes which he anticipated would come alongside, the trying-out works
    fires were lighted, and the huge try-pots filled with water, which when boiling
    would add to their means of defence, by pouring it down in bucketsful upon
    the savages; the cable was prepared for slipping, sails loosened, and every
    other precaution which suggested itself to him made.</p>
  <p>The sun dropped into the western sea-rim, and there was still no sign of
    the captain&rsquo;s boat. On the shore an ominous silence prevailed, though
    now and then it would be broken by the weird, resonant boom of a conch-shell.
    The night was passed in the greatest anxiety by all on board, every man,
    musket in hand, keeping a keen lookout.</p>
  <p>Almost as the dawn broke, two canoes were seen to put off from Nukualofa
    beach, and come towards the ship. They were manned by young Tongan &ldquo;bucks&rdquo;  who,
    in reply to the mate&rsquo;s questions as to the whereabouts of the captain
    and his crew, answered him with gestures which the ship&rsquo;s company rightly
    enough construed as meaning that their comrades had all been killed, and
    that <i>their</i> turn would come shortly. This so enraged the seamen that
    they tried to induce Mr. Wright to open fire on the canoes, destroy them,
    and get the ship away before worse happened. But the mate, hoping that his
    people on shore were still alive, and that he could yet rescue them, refused
    to comply, and the whole of that day and night passed without further happening.</p>
  <p>On the following morning several canoes came within hail and then lay-to.
    In one of them was the Malay, who asked the mate to come ashore, as the captain
    and the supercargo wished to see him. The mate temporised and requested the
    Malay to come on board and explain matters, but he refused and returned to
    the shore.</p>
  <p>In a few hours he reappeared at the head of a fleet of canoes, and then,
    to Mr. Wright&rsquo;s intense astonishment, he saw that the Malay was accompanied
    by a young white woman, who was sitting on the forward outrigger of the canoe
    of which the Malay was steersman. The flotilla brought to within pistol-shot
    of the ship, and the woman stood up and called to him in English&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on shore and see the captain. He wants to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mate made no answer, but beckoned to the fleet of canoes to come nearer.
    And then, mercifully, as he took another look at the white woman, he saw
    her, when the surrounding savages were not watching, shake her head vehemently
    to him not to comply with the request she had made.</p>
  <p>The flotilla came still nearer, and again Elizabeth Morey was made to repeat
    the request for him to &ldquo;come on shore and see the captain.&rdquo; Wright,
    surmising that she was acting under coercion, appeared to give little heed
    to her request, but told the Malay, who seemed to direct the natives, that
    he would wait for the captain. Then the fleet of canoes turned, and headed
    for the shore, and the captive white woman gave the mate a despairing, agonised
    look that not only filled him with the deepest commiseration for her, but
    almost convinced him that poor Pendleton and the others were dead.</p>
  <p>Another night of wearing anxiety passed, and again with the dawn a single
    canoe came off, manned by half a dozen armed natives steered by the Malay
    and carrying Miss Morey. This canoe was followed by many others, but the
    leading one alone came close enough to the whaleship to communicate. Little
    by little her savage crew drew nearer, watching every movement of those on
    board with the utmost suspicion; the mate, who was standing at the break
    of the poop on the starboard side, desired them to come closer, holding in
    his hand a loaf of bread, which he said he wanted to give to the white woman.
    The loaf was enclosed in a piece of white paper, on which he had written
    these words&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear that all on shore are murdered. I will wait here a few days
    in the hope that you may be able to escape to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For some minutes the savages watched the white man, who, apparently disgusted
    with his attempts to induce them to come closer and take the loaf of bread,
    placed it on the rail and lit his pipe. The Malay again urged him to come
    ashore and &ldquo;see the captain&rdquo; but Wright made an impatient gesture
    and told him he must come closer if he wanted to talk. The scoundrel did
    bring the canoe a few fathoms nearer, and then stopped her way.</p>
  <p>Then the girl, unable to restrain herself any longer, stood up and cried
    out&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All your friends on shore have been killed,&rdquo; then she leapt
    into the water and swam towards the ship.</p>
  <p>A yell of rage burst from the natives in the canoes, but it was answered
    by the fire of musketry from the ship and the thunder of two car-ronades,
    which, loaded with iron nuts and bolts, had been in readiness, one on the
    poop, the other on the topgallant forecastle&mdash;and the girl succeeded
    in reaching the ship&rsquo;s side in time to take hold of a life-buoy secured
    to a line which was thrown to her, and Wright, jumping overboard, helped
    the poor creature up over the side into safety.</p>
  <p>Then began a desperate and furious assault to capture the ship. The savages,
    led by the renegade Malay, made three successive attempts to board, but were
    each time beaten back by Wright and his gallant seamen, and the crystal water
    around the <i>Union</i> was soon reddened to a deep hue. Meanwhile the cable
    had been slipped, and, like the <i>Portland</i>, the <i>Union&rsquo;s</i> company
    were saved from death by the freshness of the trade-wind alone. In half an
    hour after the last attack had been repelled, the ship was out of danger
    from pursuit. As soon as the vessel had cleared the passage Wright hove her
    to, and went down below to Miss Morey, who, exhausted and almost hysterical
    as she was, yet answered his questions readily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must forgive me, madam, but it is my duty to at once ask you
    an important question. Are you <i>sure</i> that Captain Pendleton and the
    supercargo are dead? I cannot take the ship away if there is any uncertainty
    about their fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I beseech you, sir, to have no doubts. I saw the two gentlemen beaten
    to death by clubs before my eyes.... They were sitting down to eat when they
    were murdered. One was killed by the Malay man, the other by an old <i>matabuli</i>,
    (Counsellor)... Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, sir, do not delay! The natives
    have been planning to capture this ship and murder her people for the past
    three days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she became more collected she satisfied him that all of Captain
    Pendleton&rsquo;s party had been cruelly and treacherously murdered, and
    also told him her own terrible story previous to the arrival of the <i>Union</i>.</p>
  <p>The destruction of poor Pendleton and Mr. Boston had been planned, she said,
    by the Malay; and when he and his native friends found that they could not
    induce Mr. Wright to further weaken his ship&rsquo;s company by sending another
    boat&rsquo;s crew on shore, so that the <i>Union</i> might the more easily
    be captured, she was ordered under the most awful threats to act as decoy.
    Resolved to upset their diabolical plan, or die in the attempt, she gave
    an apparently cheerful assent to the meditated scheme of murder, and hence
    her appearance in the canoe with the treacherous Malay.</p>
  <p>Under the kindly care of Mr. (now Captain) Wright, the young woman soon
    regained her health and strength in a great measure and her delight knew
    no bounds when he announced to her his intention of returning to Sydney Cove
    to refit before proceeding home to America. The <i>Union</i>, as we have
    before stated, entered Sydney harbour in October, 1804, and before that time
    the simple gratitude of the rescued girl to her rescuer had changed into
    a deeper and tenderer feeling. But we must not anticipate.</p>
  <p>As soon as Captain Wright had made his report to the New South Wales authorities,
    Miss Morey went on shore, where she was treated most hospitably by the wives
    of some of the military officers, whilst Wright was refitting his ship.</p>
  <p>A few days afterwards there arrived in Sydney Harbour an East India ship,
    the captain of which gave Wright some interesting particulars concerning
    the <i>Portland</i> and Captain Melton. The latter had had a peculiar history.
    At the end of the year 1800 he appeared in Manila, where he was entrusted
    with the command of a brig belonging to a Mr. John Stewart Kerr, the American
    Consul of that city. His orders were to proceed to Batavia, and there dispose
    of his cargo, bringing in return saleable goods for the Manila market He
    was given also a letter of credit for $20,000 the better to load the vessel.
    On arrival at Batavia he sold the cargo and the brig into the bargain, and
    purchased in her place the <i>Portland</i>, a ship of about 400 tons. From
    Batavia he wrote to Kerr&mdash;he seemed to have been the Captain &ldquo;Bully&rdquo; Hayes
    of his time&mdash;informed him of what he had done and mentioned that as
    he intended to make &ldquo;a long pleasure cruise&rdquo; among the islands
    of the South Pacific, he did not expect to return to Manila for some considerable
    time!</p>
  <p>He also, it is needless to say, duly cashed his letter of credit for $20,000,
    which six months afterwards was duly presented and taken up by Mr. Kerr.</p>
  <p>The <i>Portland</i> was then chartered by a firm of Dutch merchants at Batavia
    to proceed to Serra Bay to load rice and return to Batavia. Melton sailed
    to Serra Bay, loaded his cargo of rice, and instead of returning to Batavia,
    went to the Isle of France and there cheerfully sold it. The next account
    of him received at Manila was that he was having a &ldquo;real good time&rdquo; at
    the Cape of Good Hope, where his fascinating manners and command of money
    (Kerr&rsquo;s money) made him many friends. Suddenly, however, he and the <i>Portland</i> disappeared,
    and Elizabeth Morey, as we have mentioned, accompanied him. He had given
    out that he was bound for the North-west coast of America, to enter into
    the fur trade, but, beyond that rumour, nothing more was heard of him until
    the <i>Union</i> arrived at Port Jackson, and Elizabeth Morey told the tale
    of his dreadful end.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>No further mention of the names of Captain Daniel Wright, Elizabeth Morey,
    or the good ship <i>Union</i> appear in the early Sydney records after 1806;
    but that the girl&rsquo;s rescue by the gallant mate of the whaleship led
    to her ultimate happiness we can safely assume, for in the year 1836 there
    were married in Honolulu, Sandwich Islands, one &ldquo;Marie Kaiulani Shepherd,
    daughter of John Shepherd, to Daniel Morey Wright, master of the ship <i>Patience</i>,
    of New Bedford, and son of Daniel and Elizabeth Wright, of Salem, U.S.A.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheAmericansInTheSouthSeas"></a>The Americans In The South Seas</b></h2>
  <p>Perhaps the proper title of this article should be &ldquo;The Influence
    of American Enterprise upon the Maritime Development of the first Colony
    in Australia,&rdquo; but as such a long-winded phrase would convey, at the
    outset, no clearer conception of the subject-matter than that of &ldquo;The
    Americans in the South Seas,&rdquo; we trust our readers will be satisfied
    with the simpler title.</p>
  <p>It is curious, when delving into some of the dry-as-dust early Australian
    and South Sea official records, or reading the more interesting old newspapers
    and books of &ldquo;Voyages,&rdquo; to note how soon the Americans &ldquo;took
    a hand&rdquo;  in the South Sea trade, and how quickly they practically monopolised
    the whaling industry in the Pacific, from the Antipodes to Behring Straits.</p>
  <p>The English Government which had despatched the famous &ldquo;First Fleet&rdquo; of
    convict transports to the then unknown shores of Botany Bay, had not counted
    upon an American intrusion into the Australian Seas, and when it came, Cousin
    Jonathan did not receive a warm welcome from the English officials stationed
    in the newly founded settlement on the shore of Sydney Cove, as the first
    settlement in Australia was then called. This was scarcely to be wondered
    at, for many of those officers who formed part of the &ldquo;First Fleet&rdquo; expedition
    had fought in the war of the rebellion, and most of them knew, what was a
    fact, that the English Government only a few years earlier had seriously
    considered proposals for colonising New South Wales with American loyalists,
    who would have, in their opinion, made better settlers than convicts. And
    it is probable that if the crowded state of the English gaols and prison
    hulks had not forced the Government into quickly finding penal settlements
    for their prisoners, the plan would have been carried out.</p>
  <p>When his Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Guardian</i> under the command of Nelson&rsquo;s &ldquo;brave
    captain, Riou,&rdquo; was wrecked off the Cape of Good Hope, and her cargo
    of stores, badly needed by the starving colonists of New South Wales, were
    lying at Cape Town without means of transport, an American merchant skipper
    saw his chance and offered to convey them to Sydney Cove. But the English
    officers, although they knew that the colony was starving, were afraid to
    take the responsibility of chartering a &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; ship. Lieutenant
    King&mdash;afterwards to become famous in Australian history&mdash;wrote
    to the almost heartbroken and expectant Governor Phillip from the Cape as
    follows: &ldquo;There is here a Whitehaven man who, on his own head, intends
    going immediately to America and carrying out two vessels, one of 100 or
    120 tons&mdash;a Marble Head schooner&mdash;and the other a brig of 150 tons,
    both of which he means to load with salt beef and pork which he can afford
    to sell in the colony at 7d. a pound. He wished encouragement from me, but
    anything of that kind being out of my power to give him, he has taken a decided
    part and means to run the risque. I mention this so that you may know what
    is meant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This &ldquo;risque,&rdquo; undertaken by the adventurous &ldquo;Whitehaven
    man&rdquo; was the genesis of the American trading and whaling industry in
    the Southern Seas, and American enterprise had much to do with the development
    of the infant colony of New South Wales, inasmuch as American ships not only
    brought cargoes of food to the starving colonists, but American whalemen
    showed the unskilled British seamen (in this respect) how to kill the sperm
    whale and make a profit of the pursuit of the leviathan of the Southern Seas.</p>
  <p>In 1791 some returning convict transports, whose captains had provided themselves
    with whaling gear, engaged in the whale fishing in the South Pacific on their
    way home to England. Whales in plenty were seen, but the men who manned the
    boats were not the right sort of men to kill them&mdash;they knew nothing
    of sperm-whaling, although some of them had had experience of right whaling
    in the Arctic Seas&mdash;a very different and tame business indeed to the
    capture of the mighty cachalot. Consequently, they were not very successful,
    but the Enderby Brothers, a firm of London shipowners, were not to be easily
    discouraged, and they sent out vessel after vessel, taking care to engage
    some skilled American whalemen for each ship. Sealing parties were formed
    and landed upon islands in Bass&rsquo;s Straits, and regular whaling and
    sealing stations were formed at several points on the Australian coast, and
    by 1797 the whale fishing had become of such importance that a minute was
    issued by the Board of Trade, dated December 26th, setting forth that the
    merchant adventurers of the southern whale fishery had memoralised the Board
    to the effect that the restrictions of the East India company and the war
    with Spain prevented the said whalers from successfully carrying on their
    business, and that the Board had requested the East India Company, while
    protecting its own trading rights, to do something towards admitting other
    people to trade. The effect of the Board&rsquo;s minute&mdash;worded of course
    in much more &ldquo;high falutin&rdquo; language as should be the case when
    a mere Board of Trade addressed such a high and mighty corporation as the
    Honourable East India Company&mdash;was that directors permitted whaling
    to be carried on at Kerguelen&rsquo;s Land (in the Indian Ocean), off the
    coasts of New Holland, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the
    Philippines and Formosa, but they restrained trading further north than the
    Equator and further east than 51&deg; of east longitude, and that restraint
    remained for a long time to come.</p>
  <p>For the Spanish war trouble the whalers took another remedy: they obtained
    letters of marque and pretty soon added successful privateering to their
    whaling ventures, and the Spaniards on the coast of Peru and on the Spanish
    Pacific Islands before a year had passed found that an English whaler was
    a vessel armed with other weapons besides harpoons and lances, and was a
    good ship to keep clear of.</p>
  <p>By this time the Americans were taking a share in the whaling and sealing
    industries&mdash;rather more than their share the Englishmen thought, for
    in 1804 Governor King issued a proclamation which sets forth that: &ldquo;Whereas
    it has been represented to me that the commanders of some American vessels
    have, without any permission or authority whatever, not only greatly incommoded
    his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects in resorting to and continuing among the different
    islands in Bass&rsquo;s Straits for skins and oil, but have also in violation
    of the law of nations and in contempt of the local regulations of this Territory
    and its dependencies, proceeded to build vessels on these islands and in
    other places... to the prejudice and infringements of his Majesty&rsquo;s
    rights and properties thereon,&rdquo; he (King) had, while waiting for instructions
    from England, decided to prevent any foreigner whatever from building vessels
    whose length of keel exceeded 14 feet, except, of course, such vessel was
    built in consequence of shipwreck by distressed seamen. There was nothing
    unreasonable in this prohibition, as the whole territory being a penal settlement,
    one of the Royal instructions for its government was that no person should
    be allowed to build vessels without the express permission of the Governor,
    so the Americans were only asked to obey the existing law. The proclamation
    ended with a clause ordering that all vessels coming from the State of New
    York should do fourteen days quarantine in consequence of the plague having
    broken out there. Just about this time news reached Sydney that the crew
    of an American sealer lying in Kent&rsquo;s Bay among Cape Barren Islands
    (Bass&rsquo;s Straits) were building a schooner from the wreck of an East
    Indiaman named the <i>Sydney Cove</i>&mdash;a ship famous in Australian sea
    story. King despatched an officer to the spot with orders to &ldquo;command
    the master to desist from building any vessel whatever, and should he refuse
    to comply, you will immediately cause the King&rsquo;s mark to be put on
    some of the timbers, and forbid him and his people from prosecuting the work,
    and also forbid the erection of any habitation on any part of the coast...
    taking care not to suffer any or the least act of hostility, or losing sight
    of the attention due to the subjects of the United States,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
  <p>Writing to England on this matter, King says: &ldquo;This is the third American
    vessel that has within the last twelve months been in the Straits and among
    the islands, procuring seal skins and oils for the China market.&rdquo; In
    the same letter he tells how the loss of the ships <i>Cato</i> and <i>Porpoise</i> on
    Wreck Reef had led to the discovery of <i>beche-de-mer</i> which could then
    be sold in Canton for &pound;50 a ton; this find was another reason for keeping
    foreigners out of Australian waters.</p>
  <p>As no more is heard of the schooner building in Bass&rsquo;s Straits, we
    may assume that the Americans quietly obeyed the laws and desisted; but there
    were soon more causes of trouble.</p>
  <p>In March, 1805, a general order set forth that American ships, after receiving
    assistance and relief at Sydney Cove, were continually returning this hospitality
    by secreting on board and carrying off runaway convicts, and so it was ordered
    that every English or foreign vessel entering the ports of the settlement
    should give security for themselves in &pound;500, and two freeholders in
    the sum of &pound;50 each, not to carry off any person without the Governor&rsquo;s
    certificate that such person was free to go. This order had some effect in
    putting a stop to the practice, but not a few persons managed to leave the
    colony and reach American shores without there being evidence enough to show
    how they got away. Muir, one of the &ldquo;Scotch Martyrs,&rdquo; escaped
    in the American Ship <i>Otter</i> as far back as 1795; and although his story
    has been told before in detail, we may here briefly mention that the <i>Otter</i> was
    hired expressly to affect his escape. Muir got on board safely enough, and
    the ship sailed, but was wrecked off the west coast of America. After sufferings
    and privations enough to satisfy even the sternest justice, Muir managed
    to reach Mexico, and embarked in a Spanish frigate for Europe. The vessel
    was taken by an English man-of-war after a sharp engagement, in which Muir
    was severely wounded. His identity was concealed from the English commander,
    and he managed to reach Paris, only to die of his wound.</p>
  <p>In October, 1804, there was serious trouble in Bass&rsquo;s Straits between
    English and American sealers. Messrs. Kable and Underwood, Sydney shipowners,
    had a sealing establishment in Kent&rsquo;s Bay, and among the men employed
    were some &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; convicts. One Joseph Murrell, master of
    the sealing schooner <i>Endeavour</i>, wrote to his owners a letter in which
    he stated he was too ill to write coherently, in consequence of the usage
    he had received from one Delano, master of the American schooner <i>Pilgrim</i>.
    Delano&rsquo;s name was familiar to Governor King, inasmuch as he had taken
    a part in the 1803 attempt to colonise Port Philip, as follows: One of the
    officers, Lieutenant Bowen, on his way across Bass&rsquo;s Straits in a small
    boat, had the misfortune to carry away his rudder, and when in danger was
    rescued by Delano. Bowen, anxious to deliver some despatches, hired the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s</i> tender
    from Delano to carry them, omitting to make a bargain beforehand; and for
    this paltry service the American charged &pound;400! The British Government
    growled, but paid.</p>
  <p>But let Captain Murrell tell his story: &ldquo;At four in the morning on
    the 17th I was suddenly seized by the chief mate of the <i>Pilgrim</i>, and
    three other American ruffians&rdquo; (they were really Chilenos), &ldquo;two
    of whom caught me by the hair, the other two by the arms. They dragged me
    out of bed and trailed me in this fashion along the ground till they came
    to the sea beach. Here they beat me with clubs, then kept me three-quarters
    of an hour naked whilst they were searching for the rest of my people.&rdquo; Murrell
    goes on to detail as to how he threatened them with the wrath of the Governor,
    to which they replied that the Governor was not there to protect him. He
    was then taken to a tree and lashed to it, stripped, and all the Americans
    took a hand in flogging him into insensibility. When he recovered, he says,
    he asked for death rather than torture, and was answered savagely that he
    and his men were the means of depriving the Americans of 3,000 dollars&rsquo; worth
    of skins by their operations, and that Englishmen had better keep away from
    Cape Barren and leave the field open to Americans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;they began to sport away with their
    bloody cruelties, until some few Englishmen belonging to other [sealing]
    gangs out of Port Jackson, stung to the quick to see the cruelties exercised
    upon me without humanity, law, or justice, determined not to suffer it, and
    began to assemble. This occasioned the Americans to face about, at which
    instant I got my hands loose and ran into the sea, determined to be drowned
    rather than be tortured to death. I was followed by a number of Americans
    to the seaside, who stoned me, and sent into the water after me a Sandwich
    Island savage, who gave me desperate blows with a club. I put up my arm to
    save my head and he broke my arm in three places. I was then dragged on shore
    and left lying on the beach, the men remarking that they supposed I had had
    enough, but that there were more of their country&rsquo;s ships expected,
    who would not let me off so lightly. Then they took away some of my people,
    rescuing from my custody a King&rsquo;s prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In all a dozen men&mdash;convicts and others&mdash;were taken away by Delano
    and his ruffianly crowd of Chilenos and Portuguese, and this particular sealing
    station was practically destroyed.</p>
  <p>Captain Moody, of the colonial schooner <i>Governor King</i> had recorded
    a similar instance a few months earlier, and there is no doubt that the colonials
    had just cause for complaint; as there is equally no doubt that they themselves
    were not altogether innocent of provocation. Nothing, however, came of these
    quarrels, for although the Governor wrote to England on the matter, the authorities &ldquo;remembered
    to forget&rdquo; to answer, and the rival sealing parties continued to fight
    without bringing about a serious battle, and the whaling and sealing industry
    continued to grow in such fashion as is here indicated. What it had become
    little more than a generation later is shown in the remainder of this article,
    mentioning incidentally that an American whaler, the <i>Topaz</i>, Captain
    Folger, was the first discoverer of the descendants of the <i>Bounty</i> mutineers
    on Pitcairn Island in 1808; and that Wilkes&rsquo;  United States Exploring
    Expedition of 1836-42 was in a large measure suggested to America by the
    great increase in that half of the century of American South Sea trade. What
    this increase was can best be told in the words of the man&mdash;Mr. Charles
    Enderby&mdash;who was unquestionably the highest authority and whose house
    founded this very industry in the Southern Ocean. In April, 1849, Charles
    Enderby received a charter of incorporation for a proposed southern whale
    fishery, together with a grant of the Auckland Islands (but that is another
    story), and to celebrate the occasion a banquet was held at the London Tavern,
    Bishops-gate Street, London, presided over by the senior naval Lord of the
    Admiralty, who proposed the health of the guest of the evening, Charles Enderby.
    In replying to that toast Mr. Enderby quoted the whalemen&rsquo;s shipping
    list, in which it was shown that in March, 1849, &ldquo;the United States,
    whose flag was to be found on every sea, had 596 whale-ships of 190,000 tons,
    and manned by 18,000 seamen, while the number of English ships engaged in
    the whale trade was only fourteen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>During the next decade the English did something to improve this state of
    affairs, but their endeavour was made too late, and by the time they woke
    up to the situation the heyday of South Sea whaling was gone.</p>
  <p>We are so accustomed to take it for granted that the English (the original
    brand thereof, not the American pattern) were fifty years ago in command
    of all sea commerce, that the old-fashioned English sailor was superior to
    all others, and that his ships beat every one else&rsquo;s in everything
    appertaining to the sea, that this fact of how thoroughly the Americans beat
    us in the great whaling industry is never remembered. And whaling was and
    is now a branch of sea service that needs <i>men</i> to successfully work
    in it, for it cannot be profitably pursued with the human paint-scrubbers
    who to-day make up such a large section of our mercantile marine; and the
    success of the American whaling seamen may supply a clue to the Nelson-like
    fashion in which American men-of-warsmen tackle the serious business of the
    American Navy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBrassGunOfTheBuccaneers"></a>The Brass Gun Of The Buccaneers</b></h2>
  <p>Challoner was a trader at Jakoits Harbour in Ponap&eacute;, one of the loveliest
    of the great Caroline Archipelago in the North Pacific. He was a quiet but
    determined-looking man of fifty, and at the time of this story had been living
    on Ponap&eacute; for over five years. Unlike the generality of the white
    men who were settled on the island, he never carried arms and never entered
    into any of the disputes that too often occurred among them and ended in
    bloodshed.</p>
  <p>Many of his neighbours were scoundrels and ruffians of the deepest dye&mdash;deserters
    from whale-ships and men-of-war, or escaped criminals from California and
    the Australian colonies. Some of these earned a living by trading with the
    natives for turtle-shell and cocoanut oil, others were simply beachcombers,
    who attached themselves to the leading chiefs and gave their services to
    them in war time, receiving in return houses and land, and spending their
    lives in time of peace in the wildest dissipation and excesses.</p>
  <p>In those days the American whaling fleet made Jakoits and the other three
    harbours on the beautiful island their rendezvous before sailing northward
    to the coasts of Japan and Siberia. Sometimes there would be as many as thirty
    ships arrive within a week of each other, carrying from thirty to forty hands
    each; and these, when given liberty by their captains, at once associated
    with the beachcombing element, and turned an island paradise into a hell
    during their stay on shore.</p>
  <p>There was among these beachcombers a man named Larmer. He was of Herculean
    stature and strength, and was, in a manner, their leader. It was his habit
    in his drunken moments to vaunt of the bloody deeds which he had perpetrated
    during his crime-stained career in the Pacific Islands. For the lives of
    natives he had absolutely no regard, and had committed so many murders in
    the Gilbert Islands that he had been forcibly taken on board a whaler by
    the few white men living there, and threatened with instant death if he returned.</p>
  <p>The whaleship landed him on Ponap&eacute;, and his presence soon became
    a curse. Being possessed of plenty of arms and ammunition, he soon gained
    the friendship of a native chief ruling over the western district of the
    island, and his savage nature at once showed itself by his offering to destroy
    the inhabitants of a little island named P&agrave;kin, who had in some way
    offended this chief. His offer was accepted, and, accompanied by five ruffianly
    whites and some hundreds of natives, the unfortunate people were surprised
    and butchered. Elated with this achievement, Larmer returned to Ponap&eacute;,
    and, during the orgy which took place to celebrate the massacre, he shot
    dead one of his white companions who had displeased him over some trifling
    matter.</p>
  <p>The news was brought by a native to Challoner, who with a fellow-trader
    and several local chiefs was sitting outside his house smoking and enjoying
    the cool of the evening, and watching the flashing torches of a number of
    canoes catching flying fish beyond the barrier reef. Neither of them felt
    surprised, and Challoner remarked to the native that it was good to know
    that one bad and useless man was dead, but that it would be better still
    to hear that the man who slaughtered a whole community in cold blood was
    dead also.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have said that if I were you,&rdquo; said Dawson, the
    other trader, nervously; &ldquo;that fellow Larmer is bound to hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am quite prepared,&rdquo; Challoner replied quietly, &ldquo;as
    you know, Dawson. Things cannot go on like this. I have never killed a man
    in my life, but to kill such a brute as Larmer would be a good action.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The distance between Challoner&rsquo;s place and Kiti, where Larmer dwelt with
    his villainous associates, was but ten miles. Yet, although Larmer had now
    been living on the island for a year, Challoner had only once met and spoken
    to him.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>During a visit which he (Challoner) had made to a little harbour called
    Metalanim, he had explored some very ancient ruins there, which were generally
    believed by the white uneducated traders to have been constructed by the
    old buccaneers, though the most learned antiquarians confess themselves puzzled
    to solve the mystery of their existence. But that these ruins had been used
    as a <i>depot</i> or refuge of some sort by those who sailed the North Pacific
    more than two hundred years ago was evident, for many traces of their occupancy
    by Europeans had been found by the few white men who had visited them.</p>
  <p>It was Challoner&rsquo;s fortune to discover amid the mass of tangled vines and
    creepers that grew all over the walls, and even down in the curious chambers,
    an old brass cannon. With the aid of some of his native friends he succeeded
    in dragging it forth and conveying it in his boat to his house, where, upon
    cleaning it, he found it bore the Spanish arms over the date of its casting
    in Manila, in the year 1716. Much interested in this, he refused to sell
    the gun to several whaleship captains, who each wanted to buy it. He would
    sell it, he thought, to better advantage by sending it to Australia or Europe.</p>
  <p>Soon after its discovery he had set his people to work to clean and polish
    it. One day he saw coming towards him a man, who from his huge figure he
    knew must be Larmer, the beachcomber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, boss,&rdquo; said the man roughly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a look
    at that cannon you&rsquo;ve found, will yar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Challoner quietly, pointing to his boat-house,
    but not deigning to accompany the beachcomber and show him the weapon.</p>
  <p>Larmer made a brief but keen inspection, and then walked into the trader&rsquo;s
    room and, unasked, sat down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as new,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What do you want for
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will not sell it,&rdquo; replied the trader coldly, eyeing the
    beachcomber steadily, &ldquo;at least to no one in Ponap&eacute;. There is
    too free a display of and use of arms here as it is,&rdquo; and he looked
    pointedly at the brace of heavy Colt&rsquo;s revolvers in his visitor&rsquo;s belt.</p>
  <p>A scowl darkened Larmer&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred dollars for
    the thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want it, and I mean to have it&rdquo; And
    he rose and dashed his huge hand down upon the table.</p>
  <p>Challoner was unarmed, but his face betrayed neither fear nor any other
    emotion. He was standing with his back to the doorway of his bedroom. A thick
    curtain of navy blue calico concealed the interior of this room from the
    view of any one in the living room, and Larmer had seen no one but the trader
    about.</p>
  <p>For some few seconds there was silence; the beachcomber, with his clenched
    fist still on the table, was trying to discover whether the man before him
    was intimidated. Challoner stood unmoved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; began Larmer again, &ldquo;I want that cannon. Sru, the
    chief of Kiti, an&rsquo; me is going on a little war-party again. But I&rsquo;ll pay
    you for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I tell you that I won&rsquo;t sell it. Least of all to a man like you,
    who would use it for murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The beachcomber&rsquo;s hand went to his belt&mdash;and stayed there, as the trader
    stepped aside from the doorway and he saw a rifle pointed at his heart. It
    was held by the trader&rsquo;s wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put up your hands,&rdquo; said Challoner, with a contemptuous laugh. &ldquo;And
    now listen to me. I want no quarrel with you&mdash;don&rsquo;t force one on me.
    Now clear out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without a word the baffled man turned away. But the look of savage hatred
    that gleamed in his fierce eyes told Challoner that he had made a dangerous
    enemy. And only a few days passed before he heard from the natives that Larmer
    said he would have his revenge&mdash;and the brass gun as well&mdash;before
    many months were over.</p>
  <p>But the trader, though apparently taking no heed, was yet watchful. His
    influence with the natives of the Jakoits district was great, for they both
    liked and trusted him as a just and honourable man, and he knew that they
    would rally round him if Larmer attempted either to carry off the gun or
    do harm to him.</p>
  <p>For some months matters went on at Jakoits very quietly, and the last of
    the whaling fleet having sailed, Challoner and Dawson went about their usual
    work again, such as trading along the coast in their whaleboats and storing
    their cocoanut oil in readiness for the <i>Mocassin</i>, the trading ship
    which visited them once a year, and was now due.</p>
  <p>Although living only a few miles apart from each other, the two did not
    very often meet, but Challoner was one day surprised to see Dawson&rsquo;s boat
    pulling into the beach, for he had had a visit from his friend only the previous
    evening. The moment the boat touched the sand Dawson jumped out, and Challoner
    at once saw by the anxious expression on his face that something was wrong.</p>
  <p>He soon learnt Dawson&rsquo;s news, which was bad enough. The <i>Mocassin</i> had
    run ashore in the night at a place five miles away from Dawson&rsquo;s village,
    and it was feared she would become a total wreck unless she could be lightened
    and floated over the reef into smooth water. The captain had sent an urgent
    message for aid, and in less than half an hour the two men were on their
    way to the wreck, accompanied by nearly every male native in Challoner&rsquo;s
    village.</p>
  <p>Towards sunset on the following day, just as the boats were in sight, returning
    from the wreck, Tiaru, the trader&rsquo;s wife, with her one child and some of
    her female relatives, were coming from their bathe in the sea, when they
    heard screams from the village, and presently some terrified women fled past
    them, calling out that Larmer and another white man and a number of their
    native allies were carrying away the brass gun. In an instant the young wife
    gave the babe to a woman near her, and darted towards her husband&rsquo;s house.
    A number of women and children, encouraged by her presence, ran to alarm
    the approaching boats.</p>
  <p>In front of the trader&rsquo;s house Larmer and another beachcomber were directing
    a score of Kiti natives how to sling the heavy gun between two stout poles.
    A sentry stood on guard at the gate of Challoner&rsquo;s fence, but Tiaru dashed
    his crossed musket aside, and then sprang into the midst of her husband&rsquo;s
    enemies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Set down the gun,&rdquo; she panted indignantly, &ldquo;ye coward
    men of R&ocirc;an Kiti, and ye white men thieves, who only dare to come and
    steal when there are but women to meet and fight with thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Larmer laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get out o&rsquo; this, you meddling fool,&rdquo; he said in English, and
    then, calling to the natives to hasten ere it grew dark, he took no further
    notice of the woman before him. Then, as they prepared to raise their burden
    by a united effort upon their naked shoulders, Tiaru sprang into the house
    and quickly reappeared with a heavy knife in her hand. Twisting her lithe
    body from the grasp of one of the beachcombers, with flaming eyes she burst
    in amongst the gun carriers and began slashing at the strips of green bark
    with which the cannon was lashed to the poles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; said Larmer fiercely, striding forward and seizing
    her by her long hair. &ldquo;Take away her knife, Watty, quick!&rdquo; And
    he dragged her head back with brutal strength&mdash;to release his hold with
    a cry of savage fury as the woman turned upon him and with a swift stroke
    severed the fingers of his left hand. Again she raised her hand as Larmer
    drew a pistol and shot her through the body. She fell without a cry upon
    the gun beneath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By &mdash;, you&rsquo;ve done it now!&rdquo; said the man</p>
  <p>Watty. &ldquo;Look there! There&rsquo;s all our natives running away. We&rsquo;re as
    good as dead men if we stay here five minutes longer. I&rsquo;m off anyway&rdquo;;
    and then, hurriedly binding up his companion&rsquo;s bleeding hand, he disappeared
    into the surrounding forest after his native allies.</p>
  <p>For a few moments Larmer stood irresolute, looking first at the body of
    the woman lying across the gun, then at his wounded hand. Already the shouts
    of Challoner&rsquo;s natives sounded near, and he knew that the boats had reached
    the beach. The gun, which had cost him so dear, must be abandoned, but he
    would take a further revenge upon its owner. He ran quickly to a fire which
    burned dimly in Challoner&rsquo;s cooking-house, lit a bunch of dried palm leaves,
    and thrust it into the thatch of the dwelling-house. Then he struck into
    the jungle.</p>
  <p>As Challoner, followed by Dawson and the men of Jakoits village, rushed
    along the narrow path that led to his house, they heard the roar and crackle
    of the flames; when they gained the open they saw the bright light shining
    on the old cannon, whose polished brass was stained and streaked with red.
    Tiaru lay across the breech, dead.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>For nearly two days Challoner and his natives followed the tracks of the
    murderer into the heart of the mountain forest of Ponap&eacute;. Dawson and
    another party had left early the same night for the R&ocirc;an Kiti coast,
    where they landed and formed a cordon, which it would be impossible for Larmer
    to pass.</p>
  <p>Watty, his fellow-scoundrel, was captured early next morning. He had lost
    his way and was lying asleep beside a fire on the banks of a small stream.</p>
  <p>He was promptly shot by Dawson. Larmer was to be taken alive.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Challoner and his men pressed steadily on, driving their prey
    before them. At noon on the second day they caught sight of his huge figure
    ascending a rocky spur, and a party of natives ran swiftly to its base and
    hid at the margin of a small, deep pool. Challoner knew that his man wanted
    a drink, and would soon descend the spur to get it.</p>
  <p>For some hours not a sound broke the silence, then a stone rolled down,
    and presently Larmer&rsquo;s head appeared above a boulder. He looked carefully
    round, and then, finding all quiet, began the descent. On the very edge of
    the pool he again stopped and listened, holding his pistol at full cock.
    His left hand was slung to his chest by a piece of green hibiscus bark, which
    was passed round his neck and roughly tied.</p>
  <p>The silence all around him was reassuring, but he still held out the pistol
    as he bent his knees to drink. Ere his lips could touch the water two half-naked
    figures sprang upon him and bore him down. He was too weak to resist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not bind him,&rdquo; said Challoner, &ldquo;but tie his right
    hand behind his back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Larmer turned his bloodshot eyes upon the trader, but said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give him a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A native placed a gourd of water to his lips. He drank greedily. Then, in
    silence, Challoner and his men began their march back.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>At sunset the people of Jakoits gathered together in front of the blackened
    space whereon the trader&rsquo;s house had stood. Raised on four heavy blocks of
    stone was the still blood-stained cannon, and bound with his back to its
    muzzle was Larmer.</p>
  <p>Challoner made a sign, the brown-skinned men and women moved quickly apart
    in two parties, one on each side of the gun. Then Rul, the chief of the Jakoits&rsquo;    village, advanced with a lighted stick, touched the priming, and sprang aside.
    A sheet of flame leaped out, a bursting roar pealed through the leafy forest
    aisles, and Challoner had avenged his murdered wife.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Susani"></a>Sus&#257;ni</b></h2>
  <p>A few weeks ago I was reading a charmingly written book by a lady (the wife
    of a distinguished savant) who had spent three months on Fun&#257;futi, one
    of the lagoon islands of the Ellice Group. Now the place and the brown people
    of whom she wrote were once very familiar to me, and her warm and generous
    sympathy for a dying race stirred me greatly, and when I came across the
    name &ldquo;Fun&#257;f&#257;la,&rdquo; old, forgotten memories awoke once
    more, and I heard the sough of the trade wind through the palms and the lapping
    of the lagoon waters upon the lonely beaches of Fun&#257;f&#257;la, as Senior,
    the mate of the <i>Venus</i>, and myself watched the last sleep of Sus&#257;ni.</p>
  <p>Fun&#257;f&#257;la is one of the many islands which encircle Fun&#257;futi
    lagoon with a belt of living green, and to Fun&#257;f&#257;la&mdash;&ldquo;the
    island of the pandanus palm&rdquo;&mdash;Senior and I had come with a party
    of natives from the village on the main island to spend a week&rsquo;s idleness.
    Fifty years ago, long before the first missionary ship sailed into the lagoon,
    five or six hundred people dwelt on Fun&#257;f&#257;la in peace and plenty&mdash;now
    it holds but their bones, for they were doomed to fade and vanish before
    the breath of the white man and his civilisation and &ldquo;benefits,&rdquo; which
    to the brown people mean death, and as the years went by, the remnant of
    the people on Fun&#257;f&#257;la and the other islets betook themselves to
    the main island&mdash;after which the lagoon is named&mdash;for there the
    whale-ships and trading schooners came to anchor, and there they live to
    this day, smitten with disease and fated to disappear altogether within another
    thirty years, and be no more known to man except in the dry pages of a book
    written by some learned ethnologist.</p>
  <p>But twice every year the people of Fun&#257;futi betake themselves to Fun&#257;f&#257;la
    to gather the cocoa-nuts, which in the silent groves ripen and fall and lie
    undisturbed from month to month; then for a week or ten days, as the men
    husk the nuts, the women and children fish in the daytime among the pools
    and runnels of the inner reef, and at night with flaring torches of palm-leaf
    they stand amid the sweeping surf on the outer side of the narrow islet,
    and with net and spear fill their baskets with blue and yellow crayfish.
    Then when all the work is done, the canoes are filled with the husked cocoanuts,
    and with laughter and song&mdash;for they are yet a merry-hearted though
    vanishing people&mdash;they return to the village, and for another six months
    Fun&#257;f&#257;la is left to the ceaseless call of the restless sea upon
    the outer reef, and the hoarse cry of the soaring frigate birds.</p>
  <p>One afternoon Senior and myself, accompanied by a young, powerfully-built
    native named Suka, were returning to the temporary village on Fun&#257;f&#257;la&mdash;a
    collection of rude huts thatched with palm leaves&mdash;from a fishing excursion
    on the outer reef, when we were overtaken by a series of sudden squalls and
    downpours of rain. We were then walking along the weather shore of the island,
    which was strewn with loose slabs of coral stone, pure white in colour and
    giving forth a clear, resonant sound to the slightest disturbing movement
    On our right hand was a scrub of <i>puka</i> trees, which afforded no shelter
    from the torrential rain; on our left the ocean, whose huge, leaping billows
    crashed and thundered upon the black, shelving reef, and sent swirling waves
    of whitened foam up to our feet.</p>
  <p>For some minutes we continued to force our way against the storm, when Suka,
    who was leading, called out to us that a little distance on along the beach
    there was a cluster of <i>p&#257;p&#257;</i> (coral rocks), in the recesses
    of which we could obtain shelter. Even as he spoke the rain ceased for a
    space, and we saw, some hundreds of yards before us, the spot of which he
    had spoken&mdash;a number of jagged, tumbled-together coral boulders which
    some violent convulsion of the sea had torn away from the barrier reef and
    hurled upon the shore, where, in the course of years, kindly Nature had sent
    out a tender hand and covered them with a thick growth of a creeper peculiar
    to the low-lying atolls of the mid-Pacific, and hidden their rugged outlines
    under a mantle of vivid green.</p>
  <p>As we drew near, the bright, tropic sun shone out for a while, and the furious
    wind died away, seeming to gather fresh strength for another sweeping onslaught
    from the darkened weather horizon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; said Suka, pointing to the rocks, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    bad to be smitten with such rain as this. Let us rest in the <i>p&#257;p&#257;</i> till
    the storm be over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Following our all but naked guide, who sprang from stone to stone with the
    surefootedness of a mountain goat, we soon reached the cluster of rocks,
    the bases of which were embedded in the now hard and stiffened sand, and
    almost at the same moment another heavy rain squall swept down and blurred
    sea and sky and land alike.</p>
  <p>Bidding us to follow, Suka began to clamber up the side of the highest of
    the boulders, on the seaward face of which, he said, was a small cave, used
    in the olden days as a sleeping place by fishermen and sea-bird catchers.
    Suddenly, when half-way up, he stopped and turned to us, and with a smile
    on his face, held up his hand and bade us listen. Some one was singing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is Susani,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;she did not sleep in the
    village last night. She comes to this place sometimes to sing to the sea.
    Come, she is not afraid of white men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grasping the thick masses of green vine called <i>At At</i> which hung from
    the summit of the rock, we at last reached the foot of the cave, and looking
    up we saw seated at the entrance a young native girl of about twelve years
    of age. Even though we were so near to her she seemed utterly unconscious
    of our presence, and still sang in a low, soft voice some island chant, the
    words of which were strange to both my companion and myself although we were
    well acquainted with nearly all the <i>Tokelauan</i> dialects.</p>
  <p>Very quietly we stood awaiting till she turned her face towards us, but
    her eyes were bent seaward upon the driving sheets of rain, and the tumbling
    surf which thrashed upon the shore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Suka in a low voice; &ldquo;she will see us soon. &rsquo;Tis
    best not to disturb her. She is afflicted of God and seeth many things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her song ceased, and then Suka, stepping forward, touched her gently upon
    the arm. She looked up and smiled into his face, and then she let her full,
    dark eyes rest upon the strangers who stood behind, then again she turned
    to Suka in mute, inquiring wonder.</p>
  <p>He bent down and placed his cheek against hers, &ldquo;Be not afraid, Sus&#257;ni;
    they be good friends. And see, little one, sit thee further back within the
    cave, for the driving rain beats in here at the mouth and thy feet are wet
    and cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose without a word and stood whilst the kindly-hearted native unrolled
    an old mat which lay at the end of the cave and spread it out in the centre.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, Sus&#257;ni, dear one,&rdquo; he said gravely, and his usually
    harsh and guttural voice sounded soft and tender. &ldquo;Come, sit thee here,
    and then in a little while shall I get wood and make a fire so that we may
    eat. Hast eaten to-day, little one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head; a faint smile parted her lips, and then her strange,
    mournful eyes for a moment again sought ours as she seated herself on the
    mat Suka beckoned us to approach and sit near her, himself sitting a little
    apart and to one side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sus&#257;ni,&rdquo; he said, bending forward and speaking slowly
    and carefully,  &ldquo;<i>fealofani tau lima i taka soa</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;give
    your hand to my friends&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>The girl held out her left hand, and Senior and I each took it in turn gently
    within our own, and uttered the native greeting of &ldquo;<i>Fakaalofa</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She can talk,&rdquo; said Suka, &ldquo;but not much. Sometimes for
    many days no word will come from her lips. It is then she leaveth the village
    and walks about in the forest or along the beaches when others sleep. But
    no harm can come to her, for she is <i>tausi mau te Atua</i>.(<i>In God&rsquo;s
    special keeping)</i> And be not vexed in that she gave thee her left hand,
    for, see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He touched the girl&rsquo;s right arm, and we now saw that it hung limp
    and helpless upon her smooth, bared thigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was she born thus?&rdquo; asked Senior, as he placed his strong,
    rough hand upon her head and stroked her thick, wavy hair, which fell like
    a mantle over her shoulders and back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, she was born a strong child, and her mother and father were
    without blemish, and good to look upon&mdash;the man was as thick as me&rdquo; (he
    touched his own brawny chest), &ldquo;but as she grew and began to talk,
    the bone in her right arm began to perish. And then the hand of God fell
    upon her mother and father, and they died. But let me go get wood and broil
    some fish, for she hath not eaten.&rdquo; Then he bent forward and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost fear to stay here, Sus&#257;ni, with the white men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at us in turn, and then said slowly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I have no fear, Suka.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor little beggar!&rdquo; said Senior pityingly.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes later Suka had returned with an armful of dry wood and some
    young drinking cocoanuts. Fish we had in plenty, and in our bags were some
    biscuits, brought from the schooner. As Senior and I tended the fire, Suka
    wrapped four silvery sea mullet in leaves, and then when it had burnt down
    to a heap of glowing coals he laid them in the centre and watched them carefully,
    speaking every now and then to the child, who seemed scarcely to heed, as
    she gazed at Senior&rsquo;s long, yellow beard, and his bright, blue eyes
    set in his honest, sun-tanned face. Then, when the fish were cooked, Suka
    turned them out of their coverings and placed them on broad, freshly plucked <i>puka</i> leaves,
    and Senior brought the hard ship biscuits, and, putting one beside a fish,
    brought it to the child and bade her eat.</p>
  <p>She put out her left hand timidly, and took it from him, her strange eyes
    still fixed wonderingly upon his face. Then she looked at Suka, and Suka,
    with an apologetic cough, placed one hand over his eyes and bent his head&mdash;for
    he was a deacon, and to eat food without giving thanks would be a terrible
    thing to do, at least in the presence of white men, who, of course, never
    neglected to do so.</p>
  <p>The child, hungry as she must have been, ate her food with a dainty grace,
    though she had but one hand to use, and our little attentions to her every
    now and then seemed at first to increase her natural shyness and timidity.
    But when the rude meal was finished, and my companion and myself filled our
    pipes and sat in the front of the cave, she came with Suka and nestled up
    against his burly figure as he rolled a cigarette of strong, black tobacco
    in dried banana leaf. The rain had ceased, but the fronds of the coco-palms
    along the lonely shore swayed and beat together with the wind, which still
    blew strongly, though the sun was now shining brightly upon the white horses
    of the heaving sea.</p>
  <p>For nearly half an hour we sat thus, watching the roll and curl of the tumbling
    seas upon the reef and the swift flight of a flock of savage-eyed frigate
    birds which swept to and fro, now high in air, now low down, with wing touching
    wave, in search of their prey, and listening to the song of the wind among
    the trees. Then Suka, without speaking, smiled, and pointed to the girl.
    She had pillowed her head upon his naked bosom and closed her long-lashed
    eyes in slumber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will sleep long,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will it vex thee if I
    stay here with her till she awakens? See, the sky is clear and the rain hath
    ceased, and ye need but walk along the beach till&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will wait, Suka,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;we will wait till she
    awakens, and then return to the village together. How comes it that one so
    young and tender is left to wander about alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suka pressed his lips to the forehead of the sleeping girl. &ldquo;No harm
    can come to her. God hath afflicted, but yet doth He protect her. And she
    walketh with Him and His Son Christ, else had she perished long ago, for
    sometimes she will leave us and wander for many days in the forest or along
    the shore, eating but little and drinking nothing, for she cannot open a
    cocoanut with her one hand, and there are no streams of fresh, sweet water
    here as there be in the fair land of Samoa. And yet God is with her always,
    always, and she feeleth hunger and thirst but little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Senior placed his hand on mine and gripped it so firmly that I looked at
    him with astonishment He was a cold, self-contained man, making no friends,
    never talking about himself, doing his duty as mate of the <i>Venus</i> as
    a seaman should do it, and never giving any one&mdash;even myself, with whom
    he was more open than any other man&mdash;any encouragement to ask him why
    he, a highly educated and intelligent man, had left civilisation to waste
    his years as a wanderer in the South Seas. Still grasping my hand, he turned
    to me and spoke with quivering lips&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She walketh with God!&rsquo; Did you hear that? Did
    you look into her eyes and not see in them what fools would call insanity,
    and what I <i>know</i> is a knowledge of God above and Christ and the world
    beyond. &lsquo;God
    has afflicted her,&rsquo; so this simple-minded native, whom many men in
    their unthinking moments would call a canting, naked kanaka, says; but God
    has <i>not</i> afflicted her. He has blessed her, for in her eyes there is
    that which tells me better than all the deadly-dull sermons of the highly
    cultured and fashionable cleric, who patters about the Higher Life, or the
    ranting Salvationist who bawls in the streets of Melbourne or Sydney about
    the Blood of the Lamb, that there <i>is</i> peace beyond for all.... &lsquo;God
    has afflicted this poor child!&rsquo; Would that He might so afflict me physically
    as He has afflicted her&mdash;if He but gave me that inner knowledge of Himself
    which so shines out and is glorified in her face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice, rising in his excitement, nearly awakened her; so Suka, with
    outstretched hand, enjoined silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She sleeps, dear friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A year had come and gone, and the <i>Venus</i> again lay at anchor in the
    broad lagoon of Fun&#257;futi. Suka had come aboard whilst the schooner was
    beating up to the anchorage, and said that there had been much sickness on
    the island, that many people had died, and that Sus&#257;ni with other children
    was <i>tali mate</i> (nearly dead). Could we give them some medicine? for
    it was a strong sickness this, and even the &ldquo;thick&rdquo;(<i>strong,
    stout)</i> man or woman withered and died from it. Soon they would all be
    dead.</p>
  <p>Alas! we could not help them much, for our medicine chest was long since
    depleted of the only drug that would have been of service. At every island
    in the group from Nanomea southwards we had found many of the people suffering
    and dying from a malignant type of fever introduced by an Hawaiian labour
    vessel. Then an additional misfortune followed&mdash;a heavy gale, almost
    of hurricane force, had set in from the westward and destroyed countless
    thousands of cocoanut trees, so that with the exception of fish, food was
    very scarce.</p>
  <p>We sent Suka on shore in the boat at once with a few mats of rice and bags
    of biscuit&mdash;all the provisions we could spare. Then as soon as the vessel
    was anchored the captain, Senior, and myself followed. The resident native
    teacher met us on the beach, his yellow face and gaunt frame showing that
    he, too, had been attacked. Many of the people, he told us, had gone to the
    temporary village on Fun&#257;f&#257;la, where a little more food could be
    obtained than on the main island, the groves of palms there not having suffered
    so severely from the gale. Among those who had gone were Sus&#257;ni and
    the family who had adopted her, and we heard with sorrow that there was no
    hope of the child living, for that morning some natives had arrived from
    Fun&#257;f&#257;la with the news that nearly all the young children were
    dead, and those remaining were not expected to live beyond another day or
    two.</p>
  <p>After spending an hour with the teacher, and watching him distribute the
    rice and biscuit among his sick and starving people, we returned to the ship
    with the intention of sailing down to Fun&#257;f&#257;la in the boat and
    taking the natives there some provisions. The teacher thanked us warmly,
    but declined to come with us, saying that he could not leave the many for
    the few, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; he added sadly,  &ldquo;who will read the service
    over those who die? As you sail down the lagoon you will meet canoes coming
    up from Fun&#257;f&#257;la bringing the dead. I cannot go there to bury them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was nearly midnight when we put off from the schooner&rsquo;s side, but
    with Suka as pilot we ran quickly down to the island. A few natives met us
    as we stepped on shore, and to these we gave the provisions we had brought,
    telling them to divide them equally. Then with Suka leading, and carrying
    a lighted torch made from the spathe of the cocoanut tree, we made our way
    through the darkened forest to the house in which Sus&#257;ni and her people
    were living. It was situated on the verge of the shore, on the weather side
    of the narrow island, so as to be exposed to the cooling breath of the trade
    wind, and consisted merely of a roof of thatch with open sides, and the ground
    within covered with coarse mats, upon which we saw were lying three figures.</p>
  <p>Making as little noise as possible Suka called out a name, and a man threw
    off his sleeping mat and came out; it was Sus&#257;ni&rsquo;s adopted father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said in his simple manner, in answer to our inquiries, &ldquo;Sus&#257;ni
    is not yet dead, but she will die at dawn when the tide is low. &rsquo;Tis
    now her last sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stepping very softly inside the house so as not to disturb her, we sat down
    to wait her awakening. Suka crouched near us, smoking his pipe in silence,
    and watching the sleeping girl to see if she moved.</p>
  <p>Just as the weird cries of the tropic birds heralded the approach of dawn,
    the woman who lay beside Sus&#257;ni rose and looked into her face. Then
    she bade us come nearer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is awake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The child knew us at once, even in that imperfect light, for the moment
    Senior and myself stood up she tried to raise herself into a sitting posture;
    in an instant Suka sprang to her aid and pillowed her head upon his knees;
    weak as she was, she put out her hand to us, and then let it lie in the mate&rsquo;s
    broad palm, her deep, mysterious eyes resting upon his face with a strange
    look of happiness shining in them. Presently her lips moved, and we all bent
    over her to listen; it was but one word&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Fakaalofa!</i>&rdquo;(My love to you)</p>
  <p>She never spoke again, but lay breathing softly, and as the sun shot blood
    red from the sea and showed the deathly pallor of her face, poor Suka gave
    way, and his stalwart bosom was shaken with the grief he tried in vain to
    suppress. Once more she raised her thin, weak hand as if she sought to touch
    his face; he took it tremblingly and placed it against his cheek; in another
    moment she had ceased to breathe.</p>
  <p>As I walked slowly along the beach to the boat I looked back; the White
    Man and the Brown were kneeling together over the little mat-shrouded figure.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBrothersInLaw"></a>The Brothers-In-Law</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">A Tale Of The Equatorial Islands</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said T&#257;vita the teacher, pointing with his paddle
    to a long, narrow peninsula which stretched out into the shallow waters of
    the lagoon, &ldquo;there, that is the place where the battle was fought.
    In those days a village of thirty houses or more stood there; now no one
    liveth there, and only sometimes do the people come here to gather cocoanuts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The White Man nodded. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a fair place to look upon. Let
    us land and rest awhile, for the sun is hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The native pastor swung the bow of the canoe round towards the shore, and
    presently the little craft glided gently upon the hard, white sand, and the
    two men got out, walked up to the grove of cocoa-palms, and sat down under
    their shade to rest and smoke until the sun lost some of its fierce intensity
    and they could proceed on their journey homeward to the principal village.</p>
  <p>The White Man was the one trader living in Peru,{*} the native was a Samoan,
    and one of the oldest and bravest missionaries in the Pacific. For twenty
    years he had dwelt among the wild, intractable, and savage people of Peru&mdash;twenty
    years of almost daily peril, for in those days the warlike people of the
    Gilbert Group resented the coming of the few native teachers scattered throughout
    the archipelago, and only T&#257;vita&rsquo;s undaunted courage and genial disposition
    had preserved the lives of himself and his family. Such influence as he now
    possessed was due, not to his persistent attempts to preach Christianity,
    but to his reputation for integrity of conduct and his skill as a fisherman
    and carpenter.</p>
  <p>* Francis Island, or Peru, is one of the largest atolls of the Gilbert Group
    in the South Pacific, about one hundred and twenty miles south of the Equator</p>
  <p>The White Man and he were firm friends, and that day they had been down
    to the north end of the lagoon to collect a canoe load of the eggs of a small
    species of tern which frequented the uninhabited portion of the island in
    myriad swarms.</p>
  <p>Presently, as they sat and smoked, and lazily watched a swarm of the silvery
    mullet called <i>kanae</i> disporting themselves on the glassy surface of
    the lagoon, the White Man said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who were these white men, T&#257;vita, who fought in the battle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hast never heard the story?&rdquo; inquired the teacher in Samoan.</p>
  <p>The trader shook his head. &ldquo;Only some of it&mdash;a little from one,
    a little from another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then listen,&rdquo; said T&#257;vita, re-filling his pipe and leaning
    his broad back against the bole of a cocoa-palm.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was nineteen years ago, and I had been living on the island but
    a year. In those days there were many white men in these islands. Some were
    traders, some were but <i>papalagi tafea </i>(Beachcombers) who spent their
    days in idleness, drunkenness, and debauchery, casting aside all pride and
    living like these savage people, with but a girdle of grass around their
    naked waists, their hands ever imbued in the blood of their fellow white
    men or that of the men of the land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, on this island, were two traders and many beachcombers. One
    of the traders was a man named Carter, the other was named West. Carter the
    people called &lsquo;Karta,&rsquo; the other by his fore name, which was &lsquo;Simi&rsquo; (Jim).
    They came here together in a whaleship from the Bonin Islands with their
    wives&mdash;two sisters, who were Portuguese half-castes, and both very beautiful
    women. Carter&rsquo;s wife had no children; West, who was the younger man,
    and who had married the younger sister, had two. Both brought many thousands
    of dollars worth of trade with them to buy cocoanut oil, for in those days
    these natives here did not make copra as they do now&mdash;they made oil
    from the nuts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Karta built a house on the north end of the island, where there is
    the best anchorage for ships, West chose to remain on the lee side where
    he had landed, and bought a house near to mine. In quite a few days we became
    friends, and almost every night we would meet and talk, and his children
    and mine played together. He was quite a young man, and had been, he told
    me, the third mate of an English ship which was cast away on the Bonin Islands
    four years before, where he had met Karta, who was a trader there, and whose
    wife&rsquo;s sister he married.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One day they heard from the captain of a whaleship that there was
    much money to be made on this island of Peru, for although there were many
    beachcombers living here there was no trader to whom the people could sell
    their oil. So that was why they came here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, although these two men were married to two sisters, there was
    but little love between them, and then as time went on came distrust, and
    then hatred, born out of Karta&rsquo;s jealousy and wicked heart; but until
    they came to live here on Peru there had been no bad blood&mdash;not even
    enough to cause a bitter word, though even then the younger man did not like
    Karta, who was a man of violent temper, unfaithful to his wife, and rude
    and insulting in his manner to most men, white or brown. And Serena, his
    wife, hated him, but made no sign.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As time went on, both men prospered, for there was much oil to be
    had, and at the end of the first year a schooner came from Sydney and bought
    it. I went on board with Simi, after the oil had been rafted off to the ship&rsquo;s
    side. Karta, too, came on board to be paid for his oil. He had been drinking
    much grog and his face was flushed and angry. With him were three beachcombers
    whose foul language and insolent demeanour angered both the captain and Simi,
    who were quiet men. There were six or seven of these beachcombers living
    on the island, and they all disliked Simi, who would have none of their company;
    but in Karta&rsquo;s house they were made welcome. Night after night they
    would gather there and drink and gamble, for some of them had bags of dollars,
    for dissolute and idle as they were for the most of their time they could
    make money easily by acting as interpreters for the natives, to the captains
    of the whaleships, or as pilots to the trading vessels sailing northward
    to the Marshall Islands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The captain paid Simi partly in money and partly in trade goods,
    for the two hundred casks of oil he bought, and then Simi and I turned to
    go on shore. Karta had scarce spoken ten words to Simi, who yet bore him
    no ill-will, although for many months tales had come to us of the evil life
    he led and the insults he put upon his wife Serena.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But after he had bidden farewell to the captain, Simi held out his
    hand to his brother-in-law and said&mdash;&rsquo;My wife Luisa sendeth love
    and greetings to Serena. Is she in good health?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Karta would not take the hand held out to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is that to thee or thy wife either?&rsquo; he answered
    rudely. &lsquo;Look to thy own business and meddle not with mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simi&rsquo;s face grew red with anger, but he spoke quietly and reproved
    his brother-in-law for his rude speech. &lsquo;Why insult me needlessly before
    so many strangers?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;What harm have I or my wife Luisa
    ever done to thee?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Curse thee and Luisa, thy wife,&rsquo; said Karta again; &lsquo;she
    and thee, aye, and Serena too, are well matched, for ye be all cunning sneaks
    and fit company for that fat-faced Samoan psalm-singer who stands beside
    thee.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At these words the three beachcombers laughed, and when they saw
    that Simi made no answer, but turned aside from Karta in contempt, one of
    them called him a coward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He turned upon him quickly. &lsquo;Thou liest, thou drunken, useless
    cumberer of the earth,&rsquo; he said, looking at him scornfully; &lsquo;no
    coward am I, nor a noisy boaster like thee. This is no place for us to quarrel.
    But say such a thing to me on the beach if ye dare.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is my friend,&rsquo; said Karta, speaking with drunken rage, and
    thrusting his face into Simi&rsquo;s, &lsquo;he is as good a man as thee
    any day. To strike him or any one of us thou art afraid, thou cat-hearted
    coward and miser.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simi clenched his hands, but suddenly thrust them into his pockets
    and looked at the captain and the officers of the ship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is no place for me,&rsquo; he again said in a low voice; &lsquo;come,
    T&#257;vita, let us go,&rsquo; and without even raising his eyes to Karta and
    the three other men he went out of the cabin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That night he, Luisa, and I and my wife sat talking; and in the fulness
    of her anger at the insults heaped upon her husband, Luisa told us of some
    things.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This man Karta hateth both my sister and myself, as well as
    my husband. He hateth me because that it was I whom he desired to marry,
    four years ago; but I feared him too much to become his wife, for even in
    those days I knew him to be a drunkard and a gambler, and a licentious man.
    Then although she loved him not my sister Serena became his wife, for he
    was a man of good property, and promised to give over his evil ways and be
    a good husband to her. And he hateth her and would gladly see her dead, for
    she hath borne him no children. He is for ever flinging cruel words at her,
    and hath said to her before me that a childless man is a thing of scorn and
    disgrace even to the savage people of this island. And he makes no secret
    of his wickedness with other women. That is why my sister Serena is dull
    and heavy-minded; for she is eaten up with grief and shame.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; said Simi, &lsquo;I have known this for
    a year past, for when he is drunk he cannot conceal his thoughts. And he
    is full of anger against me because I have nought in common with him. I am
    neither a drinker of grog nor a gambler, and have suffered from him what
    I would suffer from no other man. I am no brawler, but yet &rsquo;tis hard
    to bear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as dawn came, and I was sunk in slumber, I heard a footstep
    outside my door, and then Simi called to me. &lsquo;Bring thy wife to my
    house quickly,&rsquo; he said,  &lsquo;evil work hath been done in the night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My wife and I followed him, and when we entered we saw Luisa his
    wife kneeling beside a couch and weeping over Serena, who lay still and quiet
    as if dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look,&rsquo; he said sternly, &lsquo;look what that devil
    hath done!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He lifted Serena&rsquo;s left arm&mdash;the bone was broken in two
    places, above and below the elbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We set to work quickly, and fitting the broken bones in place we
    bound her arm up in stiff, smooth strips of the spathe of the cocoanut tree,
    and then washed and dressed her feet, which were cut and bleeding, for she
    had walked barefooted, and clothed only in her night-dress, all the way from
    the north end of the island, which is nearly two leagues from my house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After she had drunk some coffee and eaten a little food she became
    stronger, and told us all that had befallen her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Karta and the three other white men came back from the ship
    when it was long past midnight, and I knew by the noise they made that they
    had all been drinking grog. I heard them talking and laughing and saying
    that thou, Simi, were a paltry coward; and then one of them&mdash;he who
    is called Joe&mdash;said that he would one day end thee with a bullet and
    take Luisa to wife, as so fine a woman deserved a better man than a cur for
    a husband. And Karta&mdash;Karta my husband&mdash;laughed and said that that
    could not be, for he meant to take thee, Luisa, for himself when he had ridden
    himself of me. His shameless words stung me, and I wept silently as I lay
    there, and pressed my hands to my ears to shut out their foul talk and blasphemies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Suddenly I heard my husband&rsquo;s voice as he rose from
    the table and came towards the sleeping room. He threw open the door and
    bade me come out and put food before him and his friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I rose at his bidding, for his face terrified me&mdash;it
    was the face of a devil&mdash;and began to clothe myself. He tore the dress
    from my hands and cursed me, and bade me go as I stood. In my fear I sprang
    to the window and tried to tear down the cane lattice-work so as to escape
    from the house and the shame he sought to put upon me. He seized me by the
    waist and tried to tear me away, but I was strong&mdash;strong with the strength
    of a man. Then it was that he went mad, for he took up a heavy <i>paua</i> stick
    and struck me twice on the arm. And had it not been that the other white
    men came in and dragged him away from me, crying shame on him, and throwing
    him down upon the floor, I would now be dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I lay quiet for a little time and then rising to my feet looked
    out into the big room, where the three men were still holding my husband
    down. One of them bade me run for my life, for Karta, he said, had gone mad
    with grog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I feared to seek aid from any of the natives, for they, too,
    dread Karta at such times; so I walked and ran, sometimes along the beach,
    sometimes through the bush till I came here. That is all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That morning the head man in our village caused the shell to sound,
    (A conch-shell) to call the people together so that they might hear from
    Simi the story of the shame put upon his wife&rsquo;s sister and upon himself
    and his house. As the people gathered around the <i>moniep</i> (The council
    house) and the head men sat down inside, the captain of the ship came on
    shore, and great was his anger when he heard the tale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let this poor woman come to my ship,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;her
    life here is not safe with such a man as that. For I know his utter vileness
    and cruelty to her. With me she shall be safe and well cared for, and if
    she so wishes she shall come with me to Fiji where my wife liveth, and her
    life will be a life of peace.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So Serena was put in the ship&rsquo;s boat, and Luisa went with her
    to remain on board till the ship sailed, which would be in three days. Then
    Simi and the head men talked together in the council house, and they made
    a law and sent a message to Karta. This was the message they sent to him: &lsquo;Because
    of the evil thou hast done and of the shame thou hast put upon the sister
    of the wife of our white man, come no more to this town. If thou comest then
    will there be war between thy town and ours, and we will burn the houses
    and harry and slay thee and the seven other white men, and all men of thy
    town who side with thee, and make slaves of the women and children. This
    is our last word.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A swift messenger was sent. Before the sun was in mid-heaven he returned,
    crying out as he ran, &lsquo;War is the answer of Karta and his village.
    War and death to Simi and to us all are his words; and to Luisa, the wife
    of the white man, he sendeth this message: &ldquo;Prepare a feast for thy
    new husband, for he cometh to take thee away from one who cannot stand against
    him.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In those days there were seven hundred fighting men in our town,
    and a great clamour arose. Spears and clubs and muskets and hatchets were
    seized, the armour of stout cinnet which covered a man from head to foot
    was put on, women filled baskets with smooth stones for the slings; and long
    before sundown the warriors set out, with Simi and the head men leading them,
    to meet their enemies mid-way&mdash;at this very place where we now sit.
    For this narrow strip of land hath been the fighting-ground of Peru from
    the old, old times long before I was born, and my years are three score and
    seven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The night was dark, but Simi and his people, when they reached this
    place, some by land and some in canoes, lit great fires on the beach and
    dug trenches in the sand very quickly, behind which all those who carried
    muskets were placed, to fire into the enemy&rsquo;s canoes as they paddled
    along the narrow passage to the landing place. Karta and his white friends
    and the people of their town had more than two hundred muskets, whilst our
    village had less than fifty. But they were strong of heart and waited eagerly
    for the fight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just before sunrise we saw them coming. There were over one hundred
    canoes, each carrying five or six men. Karta and the beachcombers were leading
    in a whaleboat, which was being rowed very swiftly. When within rifle-shot
    she grounded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As they leapt out of the boat, rifles in hand, they were followed
    by their natives, but our people fired a volley together, and two of the
    white men and many of their people fell dead in the shallow water. Then Simi
    and twenty of our best men leapt out of their trenches and dashed into the
    water to meet them. Karta was in advance of them all, and when he saw Simi
    he raised his rifle and fired. The bullet missed the white man but killed
    a native behind him. Then Karta, throwing away his rifle, took two pistols
    from his belt and shot twice at Simi who was now quite close to him. These
    bullets, too, did Simi no harm, for taking a steady aim at his foe he shot
    him through the body, and as Karta fell upon his side one of our people leapt
    on him and held his head under the water till there was no more life in his
    wicked heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fight was soon ended, for seeing three of their number killed
    so quickly, the rest of the white men ran back to their boat and tried to
    float her again; and then Simi, taking a shot-gun loaded with slugs from
    one of his men, ran up to them and shot dead the one named Joe. The other
    white men he let escape, for all their followers were now paddling off or
    swimming to the other side of the lagoon, and Simi was no lover of bloodshed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That day the people at the north end sent a message for peace, and
    peace was made, for our people had lost but one man killed, so the thing
    was ended well for us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Serena came back from the ship, for now that Karta was dead she had
    no fear. The three white men who were spared soon left Peru in a whale-ship,
    for they feared to remain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simi and his wife and children and Serena did not long stay with
    us, for he sold his house and boats to a new trader who came to the island
    about a month after the fight, and they went away to live at a place in Fiji
    called Yasawa. They were very good to me and mine, and I was sore in my heart
    to see the ship sail away with them, and at night I felt very lonely for
    a long time, knowing that I should see them no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Pâkía"></a>P&acirc;k&iacute;a</b></h2>
  <p>Late one evening, when the native village was wrapped in slumber, Temana
    and I brought our sleeping-mats down to the boat-shed, and spread them upon
    the white, clinking sand. For here, out upon the open beach, we could feel
    a breath of the cooling sea-breeze, denied to the village houses by reason
    of the thick belt of palms which encompassed them on three sides. And then
    we were away from Malepa&rsquo;s baby, which was a good thing in itself.</p>
  <p>Temana, tall, smooth-limbed, and brown-skinned, was an excellent savage,
    and mine own good friend. He and his wife Malepa lived with me as a sort
    of foster-father and mother, though their united ages did not reach mine
    by a year or two.</p>
  <p>When Malepa&rsquo;s first baby was born, she and her youthful husband apologised
    sincerely for the offence against my comfort, and with many tears prepared
    to leave my service. But although I was agreeable to let Malepa and her little
    bundle of red-skinned wrinkles go, I could not part with Temana, so I bade
    her stay. She promised not to let the baby cry o&rsquo; nights. Poor soul.
    She tried her best; but every night&mdash;or rather towards daylight&mdash;that
    terrible infant would raise its fearsome voice, and wail like a foghorn in
    mortal agony.</p>
  <p>We lit our pipes and lay back watching a moon of silvered steel poised  &lsquo;midships
    in a cloudless sky. Before us, unbroken in its wide expanse, save for two
    miniature islets near the eastern horn of the encircling reef, the glassy
    surface of the sleeping lagoon was beginning to quiver and throb to the muffled
    call of the outer ocean; for the tide was about to turn, and soon the brimming
    waters would sink inch by inch, and foot by foot from the hard, white sand,
    and with strange swirlings and bubblings and mighty eddyings go tearing through
    the narrow passage at eight knots an hour.</p>
  <p>Presently we heard a footfall upon the path which led to the boat-shed,
    and then an old man, naked but for his <i>titi</i>, or waist-girdle of grass,
    came out into the moonlight, and greeted us in a quavering, cracked voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Aue!</i> white man, my dear friend. So thou and Temana sit here
    in the moonlight!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even so, P&acirc;k&iacute;a, most excellent and good old man. Sit
    ye here beside us. Nay, not there, but here on mine own mat. So. Hast thy
    pipe with thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ancient chuckled, and his wrinkled old face beamed as he untwisted a
    black and stumpy clay from his perforated and pendulous ear-lobe, which hung
    full down upon his shoulder, and, turning it upside down, tapped the palm
    of his left hand with it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he said, with another wheezing, half-whispered, half-strangled
    laugh, &ldquo;see and hear the emptiness thereof! Nothing has been in its
    belly since cockcrow. And until now have I hungered for a smoke. Twice did
    I think to come to thee to-day and ask thee for <i>kaitalafu</i> (credit)
    for five sticks of tobacco, but I said to my pipe, &lsquo;Nay, let us wait
    till night time.&rsquo; For see, friend of my heart, there are ever greedy
    eyes which watch the coming and going of a poor old man; and had I gotten
    the good God-given tobacco from thee by daylight, friends would arise all
    around me as I passed through the village to my house. And then, lo, the
    five sticks would become but one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;P&acirc;k&iacute;a,&rdquo; I said in English, as I gave him a piece
    of tobacco and my knife, &ldquo;you are a philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stopped suddenly, and placing one hand on my knee, looked wistfully into
    my face, as an inquiring child looks into the eyes of its mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, what is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I tried to find a synonym. &ldquo;It means that you are a <i>tagata poto</i>&mdash;a
    wise man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old, brown, bald head nodded, and the dark, merry eyes danced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye. Old I may be, and useless, but I have lived&mdash;I have
    lived. And though when I am dead my children and grandchildren will make
    a <i>tagi</i> over me, I shall laugh, for I know that of one hundred tears,
    ninety and nine will be for the tobacco and the biscuit and the rice that
    with me will vanish!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He filled and lit his pipe, and then, raising one skinny, tattooed arm,
    pointed to the moon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hast such a moon as that in <i>papalagi</i> land?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, sometimes. But not always. No, not always. I know, I know. See,
    my friend; let us talk. I am full of talk to-night. You are a good man, and
    I, old P&acirc;k&iacute;a, have seen many things. Aye, many things and many
    lands. Aye, I, who am now old and toothless, and without oil in my knees
    and my elbows, can talk to you in two tongues besides my own.... Temana!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Oi</i>, good father P&acirc;k&iacute;a.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go away. The white man and I would talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I placed my hand on the bald head of the ancient &ldquo;Temana shall go
    to the house and bring us a bottle of grog. We will drink, and then you shall
    talk. I am one who would learn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man took my hand and patted it &ldquo;Yes, let us talk to-night
    And let us drink grog. Grog is good to drink, sometimes. Sometimes it is
    bad to drink. It is bad to drink when the swift blood of youth is in our
    veins and a hot word calls to a sharp knife. Ah! I have seen it! Listen!
    Dost hear the rush of the lagoon waters through the passage? That is the
    quick, hot blood of youth, when it is stirred by grog and passion, and the
    soft touch of a woman&rsquo;s bosom. I know it. I know it. But let Temana
    bring the bottle. I am not afraid to drink grog with <i>thee</i>, Ah, thou
    art not like some white men. Thou can&rsquo;st drink, and give some to a
    poor old man, and if prying eyes and babbling tongues make mischief, and
    the missionary sends thee a <i>tusi</i> (letter), and says &lsquo;This drinking
    of grog by P&acirc;k&iacute;a is wrong,&rsquo; thou sendest him a letter,
    saying, &lsquo;True, O teacher of the Gospel. This drinking of grog is very
    wrong. Wherefore do I send thee three dollars for the school, and ask thy
    mercy for old P&acirc;k&iacute;a, who was my guest.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>I slapped the ancient on his withered old back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night ye shall drink as much grog as ye like, P&acirc;k&iacute;a.
    The missionary is a good man, and will not heed foolish talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>P&acirc;k&iacute;a shook his head. &ldquo;Mareko is a Samoan. He thinketh
    much of himself because he hath been to Sini (Sydney) and stood before many
    white gentlemen and ladies, and told them about these islands. He is a vain
    fool, though a great man here in Nukufetau, but in Livapoola (Liverpool)
    he would be but as a pig. Livapoola is a very beautiful place, full of beautiful
    women. Ah! you laugh.... I am bent and old now, and my bones rattle under
    my skin like pebbles in a gourd. Then I was young and strong. Listen! I was
    a boat-steerer for three years on a London whaleship. I have fought in the
    wars of Chile and Peru. I can tell you many things, and you will understand....
    I have seen many lands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Temana returned with a bottle of brandy, a gourd of water, and three cups.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drink this, P&acirc;k&iacute;a, <i>taka ta-ina </i>(dear crony) And
    talk. Your talk is good to hear. And I can understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drank the liquor neat, and then washed it down with a cupful of water.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tapa!</i> Ah, the good, sweet grog! And see, above us is the round
    moon, and here be we three. We three&mdash;two young and strong, one whose
    blood is getting cold. Ah, I will talk, and this boy, Temana, will learn
    that P&acirc;k&iacute;a is no boasting old liar, but a true man.&rdquo; Then,
    suddenly dropping the Nukufetau dialect in which he had hitherto spoken,
    he said quietly in English&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you I could speak other languages beside my own. It is true,
    for I can talk English and Spanish.&rdquo; Then he went back into native: &ldquo;But
    I am not a vain old man. These people here are fools. They think that because
    on Sundays they dress like white men and go to church five times in one day,
    and can read and write in Samoan, that they are as clever as white men. Bah!
    they are fools, fools! Where are the strong men of my youth? Where are the
    thousand and two hundred people who, when my father was a boy, lived upon
    the shores of this lagoon? They are gone, gone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True, P&acirc;k&iacute;a. They are gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, they are perished like the dead leaves. And once when I said
    in the hearing of the <i>kaupule</i> (head men) that in the days of the <i>po-uri</i> (heathen
    times) we were a great people and better off than we are now, I was beaten
    by my own grand-daughter, and fined ten dollars for speaking of such things,
    and made to work on the road for two months. But it is true&mdash;it is true.
    Where are the people now? They are dead, perished; there are now but three
    hundred left of the thousand and two hundred who lived in my father&rsquo;s
    time. And of those that are left, what are they? They are weak and eaten
    up with strange diseases. The men cannot hunt and fish as men hunted and
    fished in my father&rsquo;s time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tah!</i> they are women, and the women are men, for now the man
    must work for the woman, so that she can buy hats and boots and calicoes,
    and dress like a white woman. Give me more grog, for these things fill my
    belly with bitterness, and the grog is sweet. Ah! I shall tell you many things
    to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me of them, old man. See, the moon is warm to our skins. And
    as we drink, we shall eat. Temana here shall bring us food. And we shall
    talk till the sun shines over the tops of the trees on Motu Luga. I would
    learn of the old times before this island became <i>lotu</i> (Christianised).&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Oi.</i> I will tell you. I am now but as an old, upturned canoe
    that is used for a sitting-place for children who play on the beach at night.
    And I am called a fool and a bad man, because I sometimes speak of the days
    that are dead. Temana, is Malepa thy wife virtuous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Se kau ilo&agrave;</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;), replied
    Temana, with a solemn face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, you cannot tell! Who can tell nowadays? But you will know when
    some day she is fined five dollars. In my time if a man doubted his wife,
    the club fell swiftly, or the spear was sped, and she was dead. And, because
    of this custom, wives in those days were careful. Now, they care not, and
    are fined five dollars many times. And the husband hath to pay the fine!&rdquo; He
    laughed in his noiseless way, and then puffed at his pipe. &ldquo;And if
    he cannot pay, then he and his wife, and the man who hath wronged him, work
    together on the roads, and eat and drink together as friends, and are not
    ashamed. And at night-time they sing hymns together!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;People must be punished when wrong is done, P&acirc;k&iacute;a,&rdquo; I
    said lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! what is five dollars to a woman? Is it a high fence set with
    spears over which she cannot climb? If a man hath fifty dollars, does not
    his wife know it, and tell her lover (if she hath one) that he may meet her
    ten times! Give me more water in this grog, good white man with the brown
    skin like mine own!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old fellow smoked his pipe in silence for a few minutes; then again
    he pointed to the moon, nodded and smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tah!</i> What a moon! Would that I were young again! See, in the
    days of my youth, on such a night as this, all the young men and women would
    be standing on the outer reef fishing for <i>malau</i>, which do but take
    a bait in the moonlight. <i>Now</i>, because to-morrow is the Sabbath day,
    no man must launch a canoe nor take a rod in his hand, lest he stay out beyond
    the hour of midnight, and his soul go to hell to burn in red fire for ever
    and ever. Bah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind these things, P&acirc;k&iacute;a. Tell me instead how
    came ye to serve in the wars of Chile and Peru, or of thy voyages in the <i>folau
    manu</i> (whaleship).&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Ah, those were the days! Twice in one whaleship
    did I sail among the ice mountains of the far south, where the wind cuts
    like a knife and the sea is black to look at <i>T&#257;pa!</i> the cold,
    the cold, the cold which burneth the skin like iron at white heat! But I
    was strong; and we killed many whales. I, P&acirc;k&iacute;a, in one voyage
    struck thirteen! I was in the mate&rsquo;s boat.... Look at this now!&rdquo; He
    held up his withered arm and peered at me. &ldquo;It was a strong arm then;
    now it is but good to carry food to my mouth, or to hold a stick when I walk.&rdquo; The
    last words he uttered wistfully, and then sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The mate of that ship was a good man. He taught me many things. Once,
    when we had left the cold seas and were among the islands of Tonga, he struck
    me in his rage because I threw the harpoon at a great sperm whale, and missed.
    That night I slipped over the side, and swam five miles to the land. Dost
    know the place called Lifuka? &rsquo;Twas there I landed. I lay in a thicket
    till daylight, then I arose and went into a house and asked for food. They
    gave me a yam and a piece of bonito, and as I ate men sprang on me from behind
    and tied me up hand and foot. Then I was carried back to the ship, and the
    captain gave those pigs of Tongans fifty dollars&rsquo; worth of presents
    for bringing me back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He thought well of thee, P&acirc;k&iacute;a, to pay so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, for I was a good man, and worth much to him. And I was not flogged,
    for the mate was my friend always. All the voyage I was a lucky man, till
    we came to a place called Amboyna. Here the mate became sick and died, so
    I ran away. This time I was not caught, and when the ship was gone, I was
    given work by an Englishman. He was a rich merchant&mdash;not a poor trader
    like thee. He had a great house, many servants, and many native wives. Thou
    hast but two servants, and no wife. Why have ye no wife? It is not proper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I expressed my deep sense of the insignificance of my domestic arrangements,
    and gave him another nip of brandy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, like him, thou hast a big heart. May you live long and become
    a <i>mau koloa</i> (rich man). Ah! the grog, the good grog. I am young again
    to-night... And so for two years I lived at Amboyna. Then my master went
    to Peretania&mdash;to Livapoola&mdash;and took me with him. I was his servant,
    and he trusted me and made much of me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Livapoola is a fine place. I was six months there, and wherever
    my master went I went with him. By and by he married, and we went to live
    at a place by the sea, in a fair white house of stone, with rich lands encompassing
    it. It was a foreign place, and we crossed the sea to go there. There were
    many women servants there, and one of them, named Lissi, began to smile at,
    and then to talk to me. I gave her many presents, for every week my master
    put a gold piece in my hand. One day I asked him to give me this girl for
    my wife. He laughed, and said I was foolish; that she was playing with me.
    I told her this. She swore to me that when I had fifty gold pieces she would
    be my wife, but that I must tell no one.... Ah! how a woman can fool a man!
    I was fooled. And every gold piece I got I gave to her to keep for me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have said that there were many servants. There was one young man,
    named Harry, whose work it was to take my master about in his <i>puha tia
    tia</i> (carriage). Sometimes I would see him talking to the girl, and then
    looking at me. Then I began to watch; but she was too cunning. Always had
    she one word for me. Be patient; when we have the fifty gold pieces all shall
    be well. We shall go away from here, and get married.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One night, as I lay upon the grass, smoking my pipe, I heard voices,
    the voices of the man Harry and Lissi. They were speaking of me. They spoke
    loudly, and I heard all that was said. &lsquo;He is but a simple fool,&rsquo; she
    said, with a laugh; &lsquo;but in another month I shall have the last of
    his money, and then thou and I shall go away quietly. Faugh! the tattooed
    beast!&rsquo; and I heard her laugh again, and the man laughed with her,
    but bade her be careful lest I should suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was a bad woman, P&acirc;k&iacute;a,&rdquo; I began, when he
    interrupted me with a quick gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I crept back into the house and got a knife, and waited. The night
    was dark, but I could see. Presently they came along a narrow path which
    led to the house. Then I sprang out, and drove my knife twice into the man&rsquo;s
    chest. I had not time to kill the woman, for at the third blow the knife
    broke off at the hilt, and she fled in the darkness. I wanted to kill her
    because she had fooled me and taken my money&mdash;forty-six gold pieces.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a great wood which ran from my master&rsquo;s house down
    to the sea. I ran hard, very hard, till I came to the water. I could see
    ships in the harbour, quite near. I swam to one, and tried to creep on deck
    and hide, but heard the sailors talking. Presently I saw a vessel&mdash;a
    schooner&mdash;come sailing slowly past. There was a boat towing astern.
    I swam softly over, and got into the boat, and laid down till it was near
    the dawn. There was but little wind then, and the ship was not moving fast,
    so I got into the water again, and held on to the side of the boat, and began
    to cry out in a loud voice for help. As soon as they heard me the ship was
    brought to the wind, and I got back into the boat. I was taken on board and
    given food and coffee, and told the captain that I had fallen overboard from
    another ship, and had been swimming for many hours. Only the captain could
    speak a little English&mdash;all the others were Italians. It was an Italian
    ship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was a long time on that ship. We went first to Rio, then down to
    the cold seas of the south, and then to Callao. But the captain never gave
    me any money, so I ran away. Why should a man work for naught? By and by
    an American whaleship came to Callao, and I went on board. I was put in the
    captain&rsquo;s boat. We sailed about a long time, but saw no whales, so
    when the ship came to Juan Fernandez I and a white sailor named Bob ran away,
    and hid in the woods till the ship was gone. Then we came out and went to
    the Governor, who set us to work to cut timber for the whaleships. Hast been
    to this island?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo; &rsquo;tis a fair land, I have heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, a fair, fair land, with green woods and sweet waters; and the
    note of the blue pigeon soundeth from dawn till dark, and the wild goats
    leap from crag to crag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst stay there long, P&acirc;k&iacute;a?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rubbed his scanty white beard meditatively. &ldquo;A year&mdash;two years&mdash;I
    cannot tell. Time goes on and on, and the young do not count the days. But
    there came a ship which wanted men, and I sailed away to Niu Silani. (New
    Zealand) That, too, is a fair land, and the men of the country have brown
    skins like us, and I soon learnt their tongue, which is akin to ours. I was
    a long time in that ship, for we kept about the coast, and the Maoris filled
    her with logs of <i>kauri</i> wood, to take to Sydney. It was a good ship,
    for although we were paid no money every man had as much rum as he could
    drink and as much tobacco as he could smoke, and a young Maori girl for wife,
    who lived on board. Once the Maoris tried to take the ship as she lay at
    anchor, but we shot ten or more. Then we went to Sydney, where I was put
    in prison for many weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know. It was, I think, because of something the captain
    had done when he was in Sydney before; he had taken away two men and a woman
    who were prisoners of the Governor had seen them on board at Juan Fernandez;
    they went ashore there to live. But the Governor of Sydney was good to me.
    I was brought before him; he asked me many questions about these islands,
    and gave me some silver money. Then the next day I was put on board a ship,
    which took me to Tahiti. But see, dear friend, I cannot talk more to-night,
    though my tongue is loose and my belly warm with the good grog. But it is
    strong, very strong, and I fear to drink more, lest I disgust thee and lose
    thy friendship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, old man. Have no fear of that. And see, sleep here with us till
    the dawn. Temana shall bring thee a covering-mat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h! Thou art good to old P&acirc;k&iacute;a. I shall stay till
    the dawn. It is good to have such a friend. To-morrow, if I weary thee not,
    I shall tell thee of how I returned to Chile and fought with the English
    ship-captain in the war, and of the woman he loved, and of the great fire
    which burnt two thousand women in a church.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tah!</i>&rdquo; said Temana incredulously; &ldquo;two thousand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; he snapped angrily, &ldquo;dost think I be drunk, boy?
    Go and watch thy wife. How should an ignorant hog like thee know of such
    things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sh, &rsquo;sh, old man. Be not so quick to anger. Temana meant
    no harm. Here is thy covering-mat. Lie down and sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He smiled good-naturedly at us, and then, pulling the mat over him to shield
    his aged frame from the heavy morning dew, was soon asleep.</p>
