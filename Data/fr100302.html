  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER 1.</a><br>
  In The Reign Of The Emperor Commodus*</h2>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Commodus</i>&mdash;Lucius Aelius Aurelius
  Commodus (161-192). Roman emperor (180-192), son and successor of Marcus
  Aurelius. In 180, reversing his father's foreign policy, he concluded peace
  with the German and the Sarmatian tribes and returned to his licentious
  pleasures in Rome. There he vaunted his strength in gladiatorial combats and
  decreed that he should be worshiped as Hercules Romanus. He changed his own
  name to Marcus Commodus Antoninus and wanted to rename the city of Rome after
  himself. Many plots to assassinate him failed, but eventually, on the order
  of his advisers, he was strangled by a wrestler. Pertinax succeed him.
  <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/Commodus.html">The Columbia
  Encyclopedia</a></i>, 3rd edition. ]</p>

  <p class="first">Golden Antioch* lay like a jewel at a mountain's throat.
  Wide, intersecting streets, each nearly four miles long, granite-paved, and
  marble-colonnaded, swarmed with fashionable loiterers. The gay Antiochians,
  whom nothing except frequent earthquakes interrupted from pursuit of
  pleasure, were taking the air in chariots, in litters, and on foot; their
  linen clothes were as riotously picturesque as was the fruit displayed in
  open shop-fronts under the colonnades, or as the blossom on the trees in
  public gardens, which made of the city, as seen from the height of the
  citadel, a mosaic of green and white.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Antioch</i>&mdash;a city of southern Turkey on
  the Orontes River near the Mediterranean Sea. Founded c. 300 BCE by Seleucus
  I, it was an important military and commercial center in the Roman era and an
  early center of Christianity. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/56/A0325600.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. Now called Antakya.]</p>

  <p>The crowd on the main thoroughfares was aristocratic; opulence was
  accented by groups of slaves in close attendance on their owners; but the
  aristocracy was sharply differentiated. The Romans, frequently less wealthy
  (because those who had made money went to Rome to spend it)&mdash;
  frequently less educated and, in general, not less dissolute&mdash;despised
  the Antiochians, although the Romans loved Antioch. The cosmopolitan
  Antiochians returned the compliment, regarding Romans as mere duffers in
  depravity, Philistines in art, but capable in war and government, and
  consequently to be feared, if not respected. So there was not much mingling
  of the groups, whose slaves took example from their masters, affecting in
  public a scorn that they did not feel but were careful to assert. The Romans
  were intensely dignified and wore the toga, pallium* and tunic; the
  Antiochians affected to think dignity was stupid and its trappings (forbidden
  to them) hideous; so they carried the contrary pose to extremes.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>pallium</i> (Latin)&mdash;a cloak or mantle worn
  by the ancient Greeks and Romans ... <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/74/P0027400.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. Usually made of wool.]</p>

  <p>Patterning herself on Alexandria, the city had become to all intents and
  purposes the eastern capital of Roman empire. North, south, east and west,
  the trade routes intersected, entering the city through the ornate gates in
  crenelated limestone walls. From miles away the approaching caravans were
  overlooked by legionaries brought from Gaul and Britain, quartered in the
  capitol on Mount Silpius at the city's southern limit. The riches of the
  East, and of Egypt, flowed through, leaving their deposit as a river drops
  its silt; were ever-increasing. One quarter, walled off, hummed with foreign
  traders from as far away as India, who lodged at the travelers' inns or
  haunted the temples, the wineshops and the lupanars.* In that quarter, too,
  there were barracks, with compounds and open-fronted booths, where slaves
  were exposed for sale; and there, also, were the caravanserais within whose
  walls the kneeling camels grumbled and the blossomy spring air grew fetid
  with the reek of dung. There was a marketplace for elephants and other
  oriental beasts.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* from <i>lupanar</i> (Latin: literally, "a wolf's den")
&mdash;a brothel. ]</p>

  <p>Each of Antioch's four divisions had its own wall, pierced by arched
  gates. Those were necessary. No more turbulent and fickle population lived in
  the known world&mdash;not even in Alexandria. Whenever an earthquake shook
  down blocks of buildings&mdash;and that happened nearly as frequently as
  the hysterical racial riots&mdash;the Romans rebuilt with a view to making
  communications easier from the citadel, where the great temple of Jupiter
  Capitolinus* frowned over the gridironed streets.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus</i>&mdash;In Roman
  mythology, Jupiter (sometimes shortened to Jove) held the same role as Zeus
  in the Greek pantheon. He was called Jupiter Optimus Maximus (Jupiter Best
  and Greatest) as the patron deity of the Roman state, in charge of laws and
  social order ... The largest temple in Rome was that of Jupiter Optimus
  Maximus on the Capitoline Hill. Here he was worshipped alongside Juno and
  Minerva, forming the Capitoline Triad. Temples to Jupiter Optimus Maximus or
  the Capitoline Triad as a whole were commonly built by the Romans at the
  center of new cities in their colonies. <i><a href=
  "http://pedia.nodeworks.com/J/JU/JUP/Jupiter_(god)/">Nodeworks
  Encyclopedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>Roman officials and the wealthier Macedonian Antiochians lived on an
  island, formed by a curve of the River Orontes at the northern end within the
  city wall. The never-neglected problem of administration was to keep a clear
  route along which troops could move from citadel to island when the rioting
  began.</p>

  <p>On the island was the palace, glittering with gilt and marble, gay with
  colored awnings, where kings had lived magnificently until Romans saved the
  city from them, substituting a proconsular* paternal kind of tyranny
  originating in the Roman patria potestas.&dagger; There was not much
  sentiment about it. Rome became the foster-parent, the possessor of
  authority. There was duty, principally exacted from the governed in the form
  of taxes and obedience; and there were privileges, mostly reserved for the
  rulers and their parasites, who were much more numerous than anybody liked.
  Competition made the parasites as discontented as their prey.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>proconsul</i> (Latin)&mdash;In the Roman
  Republic, a proconsul was a promagistrate (like a propraetor) who, after
  serving as consul, spent a year as a governor of a province. Certain
  provinces were reserved for proconsuls; who received which one by senatorial
  appointment was determined by random choosing or negotiation between the two
  proconsuls. Under the Empire, the Emperor derived a good part of his powers
  (alongside the military imperium and the tribunician power and presidency of
  the Senate in Rome) from a constitutionally "exceptional" (but permanent)
  mandate as the holder of proconsular authority over all hence so-called
  Imperial provinces, generally with one or more legions garrisoned (often each
  under a specific legate); however, he would appoint legates and other
  promagistrates to govern each such province in his name. The former Consuls
  (constitutionally still eponymic chief magistrates of the res publica, but
  politically powerless) would still receive a term as proconsul of one of the
  other, so-called Senatorial provinces. <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proconsul">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>patria potestas</i> (Latin)&mdash;the
  power held by the pater familias (the eldest or ranking male in a Roman
  household) ... Under the laws of the Twelve Tables, the pater familias had
  <i>vitae necisque potestas</i> - the "power of life and death" - over his
  children, his wife, and his slaves, all of whom were said to be <i>sub
  manu</i>, "under his hand." <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater_familias">Wikipedia</a></i>. Paraphrased.
  ]</p>

  <p>But there were definite advantages of Roman rule, which no Antiochian
  denied, although their comic actors and the slaves who sang at private
  entertainments mocked the Romans and invented accusations of injustice and
  extortion that were even more outrageous than the truth. Not since the days
  when Antioch inherited the luxury and vices of the Greeks and Syrians, had
  pleasure been so organized or its commercial pursuit so profitable. Taxes
  were collected rigorously. The demands of Rome, increased by the extravagance
  of Commodus, were merciless. But trade was good. Obedience and flattery were
  well rewarded. Citizens who yielded to extortion and refrained from criticism
  within hearing of informers lived in reasonable expectation of surviving the
  coming night.</p>

  <p>But the informers were ubiquitous and unknown, which was another reason
  why the Romans and Antiochians refrained from mixing socially more than could
  be helped. A secret charge of treason, based on nothing more than an
  informer's malice, might set even a Roman citizen outside the pale of
  ordinary law and make him liable to torture. If convicted, death and
  confiscation followed. Since the deification of the emperors it had become
  treason even to use a coarse expression near their images or statues; images
  were on the coins; statues were in the streets. Commodus, to whom all
  confiscated property accrued, was in ever-increasing need of funds to defray
  the titanic expense of the games that he lavished on Rome and the "presents"
  with which he studiously nursed the army's loyalty. So it was wise to be
  taciturn; expedient to choose one's friends deliberately; not far removed
  from madness to be seen in company with those whose antecedents might suggest
  the possibility of a political intrigue. But it was also unwise to woo
  solitude; a solitary man might perish by the rack and sword for lack of
  witnesses, if charged with some serious offense.</p>

  <p>So there were comradeships more loyal the more that treachery stalked
  abroad. Because seriousness drew attention from the spies, the deepest
  thoughts were masked beneath an air of levity, and merrymaking hid such
  counsels as might come within the vaguely defined boundaries of treason.</p>

  <p>Sextus, son of Maximus, rode not alone. Norbanus rode beside him, and
  behind them Scylax on the famous Arab mare that Sextus had won from Artaxes
  the Persian in a wager on the recent chariot races. Scylax was a slave but no
  less, for that reason, Sextus' friend.</p>

  <p>Norbanus rode a skewbald Cappadocian* that kicked out sidewise at
  pedestrians; so there was opportunity for private conversation, even on the
  road to Daphne of an afternoon in spring, when nearly all of fashionable
  Antioch was beginning to flow in that direction. Horses, litters and
  chariots, followed by crowds of slaves on foot with the provisions for
  moonlight banquets, poured toward the northern gate, some overtaking and
  passing the three but riding wide of the skewbald Cappadocian stallion's
  heels.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Cappadocia</i> (Latin)&mdash;an ancient region of
  Asia Minor in present-day east-central Turkey. Heart of a Hittite state and
  later a Persian satrapy, it was annexed by the Romans in C.E. 17. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/95/C0089500.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"If Pertinax* should really come," said Sextus.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Pertinax</i>&mdash;Publius Helvius Pertinax (126-
  193 CE) Roman general who succeeded Commodus as emperor. The son of a
  charcoal-burner, Pertinax was born at Alba Pompeia in Liguria. From being a
  teacher of grammar he rose through many important offices, both civil and
  military, to the consulate, which he held twice. Chosen, at an advanced age
  and against his will, on the 1st of January 193 CE, to succeed Commodus, he
  was himself assassinated in a soldiers' mutiny on the 28th of March 193.

  Pertinax follow this link to <a href=
  "http://www.roman-emperors.org/pertinax.htm">"De Imperatoribus Romanis"</a>,
  an online encyclopedia of Roman emperors.]</p>

  <p>"He will have a girl with him," Norbanus interrupted. He had an annoying
  way of finishing the sentences that other folk began.</p>

  <p>"True. When he is not campaigning Pertinax finds a woman
  irresistible."</p>

  <p>"And naturally, also, none resists a general in the field!" Norbanus
  added. "So our handsome Pertinax performs his vows to Aphrodite with a
  constancy that the goddess rewards by forever putting lovely women in his
  way! Whereas Stoics like you, Sextus, and unfortunates like me, who don't
  know how to amuse a woman, are made notorious by one least lapse from our
  austerity. The handsome, dissolute ones have all the luck. The roisterers at
  Daphne will invent such scandalous tales of us tonight as will pursue us for
  a lustrum, and yet there isn't a chance in a thousand that we shall even
  enjoy ourselves!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I wish now we had chosen any other meeting place than Daphne,"
  Sextus answered gloomily. "What odds? Had we gone into the desert Pertinax
  would have brought his own last desperate adorer, and a couple more to bore
  us while he makes himself ridiculous. Strange&mdash;that a man so firm in
  war and wise in government should lose his head the moment a woman smiles at
  him."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't lose his head&mdash;much," Sextus answered. "But his father
  was a firewood seller in a village in Liguria. That is why he so loves money
  and the latest fashions. Poverty and rags&mdash;austerity inflicted on him
  in his youth&mdash;great Jupiter! If you and I had risen from the charcoal-
  burning to be consul* twice and a grammarian and the friend of Marcus
  Aurelius; if you and I were as handsome as he is, and had experienced a
  triumph after restoring discipline in Britain and conducting two or three
  successful wars; and if either of us had such a wife as Flavia Titiana, I
  believe we could besmirch ourselves more constantly than Pertinax does! It is
  not that he delights in women so much as that he thinks debauch is
  aristocratic. Flavia Titiana is unfaithful to him. She is also a patrician
  and unusually clever. He has never understood her, but she is witty, so he
  thinks her wonderful and tries to imitate her immorality. But the only woman
  who really sways him is the proudish Cornificia,&dagger; who is almost as
  incapable of treachery as Pertinax himself. He is the best governor the City
  of Rome has had in our generation. Can you imagine what Rome would be like
  without him? Call to mind what it was like when Fuscianus&Dagger; was the
  governor!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>consul</i> (Latin) title of the two chief
  magistrates of ancient Rome. The institution is supposed to have arisen with
  the expulsion of the kings, traditionally in 510 B.C., and it was well
  established by the early 4th cent. B.C. The consuls led the troops,
  controlled the treasury, and were supreme in the government. At first only
  patricians were eligible, but in 367 B.C. the Licinian law opened the office
  to plebeians. Before becoming consul a man generally had to have experience
  as quaestor, aedile, and praetor, and the minimum age for a consul was
  normally set at 40 or 45. Ex-consuls became provincial governors as
  proconsuls. The year was identified by the names of the two consuls in office
  during that time. Under the empire the title of consul was continued, but
  only as a title of honor, sometimes conferred on infants or small boys.

  <p>"These are strange times, Sextus!"</p>

  <p>"Aye! And it is a strange beast we have for emperor!"</p>

  <p>"Be careful!"</p>

  <p>Sextus glanced over his shoulder to make sure that Scylax followed closely
  and prevented anyone from overhearing. There was an endless procession now,
  before and behind, all bound for Daphne. As the riders passed under the city
  gate, where the golden cherubim that Titus took from the Jews' temple in
  Jerusalem gleamed in the westering sun, Sextus noticed a slave of the
  municipium* who wrote down the names of individuals who came and went.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>municipium</i> (Latin)&mdash;a community
  incorporated into the Roman state after the dissolution of the Latin League.
  Initially, inhabitants of such municipalities were considered Roman citizens
  without voting rights. As the Italian provinces were incorporated into the
  Roman state, residents of the municipia were registered in the tribes and
  accorded full political rights. <i><a href=
  "http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-
9054286?query=municipium&amp;ct=">Encyclopedia
  Britannica</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"There are new proscriptions* brewing," he remarked. "Some friends of ours
  will not see sunrise. Well&mdash;I am in a mood to talk and I will not be
  silenced."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>proscription</i> (Latin: "proscriptio")&mdash;the
  public identification and official condemnation of enemies of the state. It
  is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as a "decree of condemnation to
  death or banishment" and is a heavily politically-charged word frequently
  used to refer to state-approved murder or persecution. Proscription implies
  the elimination en masse of political rivals or personal enemies...
  <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscription">Wikipedia</a></i>.
  ]</p>

  <p>"Better laugh then!" Norbanus advised. "The deadliest crime nowadays is to
  have the appearance of being serious. None suspects a drunken or a gay
  man."</p>

  <p>Sextus, however, was at no pains to appear gay. He inherited the moribund
  traditions that the older Cato* had typified some centuries ago. His young
  face had the sober, chiseled earnestness that had been typically Roman in the
  sterner days of the Republic. He had blue-gray eyes that challenged destiny,
  and curly brown hair, that suggested flames as the westering sun brought out
  its redness. Such mirth as haunted his rebellious lips was rather cynical
  than genial. There was no weakness visible. He had a pugnacious neck and
  shoulders.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Cato the Elder</i>&mdash;Marcus Porcius Cato
  (234-149 BCE), also known as Cato the Censor ... Roman statesman and orator,
  the first important Latin prose writer. Born of plebeian stock, he fought in
  the Second Punic War. His oratorical skills paved the way for his political
  career. He held conservative anti-Hellenic views and opposed the pro-Hellenic
  Scipio family, whose power he broke. Elected censor (magistrate in charge of
  censuses, taxes, and the public good) in 184 BCE, he tried to restore the mos
  majorum ("ancestral custom") and combat Greek influence, which he believed
  undermined Roman morality. He crafted laws against luxury and the financial
  freedom of women and never ceased to demand the destruction of Carthage. His

  <p>"I am the son of my father Maximus," he said, "and of my grandsire Sextus,
  and of his father Maximus, and of my great-great-grandsire Sextus. It offends
  my dignity that men should call a hog like Commodus a god. I will not. I
  despise Rome for submission to him."</p>

  <p>"Yet what else is there in the world except to be a Roman citizen?"
  Norbanus asked.</p>

  <p>"As for being, there is nothing else," said Sextus. "I would like to speak
  of doing. It is what I do that answers what I am."</p>

  <p>"Then let it answer now!" Norbanus laughed. He pointed to a little shrine
  beside the road, beneath a group of trees, where once the image of a local
  deity had smiled its blessing on the passerby. The bust of Commodus, as
  insolent as the brass of which the artist-slaves had cast it, had replaced
  the old benign divinity. There was an attendant near by, costumed as a
  priest, whose duty was to see that travelers by that road did their homage to
  the image of the human god who ruled the Roman world. He struck a gong. He
  gave fair warning of the deference required. There was a little guardhouse,
  fifty paces distant, just around the corner of the clump of trees, where the
  police were ready to execute summary justice, and floggings were inflicted on
  offenders who could not claim citizenship or who had no coin with which to
  buy the alternative reprimand. Roman citizens were placed under arrest, to be
  submitted to all manner of indignities and to think themselves fortunate if
  they should escape with a heavy fine from a judge who had bought his office
  from an emperor's favorite.</p>

  <p>Most of the riders ahead dismounted and walked past the image, saluting it
  with right hands raised. Many of them tossed coins to the priest's attendant
  slave. Sextus remained in the saddle, his brow clouded with an angry scowl.
  He drew rein, making no obeisance, but sent Scylax to present an offering of
  money to the priest, then rode on.</p>

  <p>"Your dignity appears to me expensive!" Norbanus remarked, grinning.
  "Gold?"</p>

  <p>"He may have my gold, if I may keep my self-respect!"</p>

  <p>"Incorrigible stoic! He will take that also before long!"</p>

  <p>"I think not. Commodus has lost his own and destroyed Rome's, but mine not
  yet. I wish, though, that my father were in Antioch. He, too, is no cringer
  to images of beasts in purple. I wrote to my father recently and warned him
  to leave Rome before Commodus's spies could invent an excuse for confiscating
  our estates. I said, an absent man attracts less notice, and our estates are
  well worth plundering. I also hinted that Commodus can hardly live forever,
  and reminded him that tides flow in and out&mdash;by which I meant him to
  understand that the next emperor may be another such as Aurelius, who will
  persecute the Christians but let honest men live in peace, instead of
  favoring the Christians and ridding Rome of honest men."</p>

  <p>Norbanus made a gesture with his right hand that sent the Cappadocian
  cavorting to the road's edge, scattering a little crowd that was trying to
  pass.</p>

  <p>"Why be jealous of the Christians?" he laughed. "Isn't it their turn for a
  respite? Think of what Nero did to them; and Marcus Aurelius did little less.
  They will catch it again when Commodus turns on his mistress Marcia; he will
  harry them all the more when that day comes&mdash;as it is sure to. Marcia
  is a Christian; when he tires of her he will use her Christianity for the
  excuse and throw the Christians to the lions by the thousand in order to
  justify himself for murdering the only decent woman of his acquaintance. Sic
  semper tyrannus.* Say what you will about Marcia, she has done her best to
  keep Commodus from making a public exhibition of himself."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sic semper tyrannus</i> (Latin)&mdash;literally,
  "thus always to tyrants," i.e., "this will always happen to tyrants." ]</p>

  <p>"With what result? He boasts he has killed no less than twelve hundred
  poor devils with his own hand in the arena. True, he takes the pseudonym of
  Paulus when he kills lions with his javelin and drives a chariot in the races
  like a vulgar slave. But everybody knows, and he picks slaves for his
  ministers&mdash;consider that vile beast Cleander,* whom even the rabble
  refused to endure another day. I don't see that Marcia's influence amounts to
  much."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Cleander</i> (d. CE 190)&mdash;a Phrygian freedman
  who was named Praetorian Prefect (commander of the Praetorian Guard) in 185
  CE. He used his office and influence to amass a huge fortune, among other
  things by selling high public and military appointments. Commodus ordered his
  execution in 190 CE to placate rioting mobs who believed that Cleander was
  responsible for a major grain shortage. Various sources, including <a href=
  "http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume1/chap4.htm">Gibbon</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"But Cleander was executed finally. You are in a glum mood, Sextus. What
  has happened to upset you?"</p>

  <p>"It is the nothing that has happened. There has come no answer to that
  letter I wrote to my father in Rome. Commodus's informers may have
  intercepted it."</p>

  <p>Norbanus whistled softly. The skewbald Cappadocian mistook that for a
  signal to exert himself and for a minute there were ructions while his master
  reined him in.</p>

  <p>"When did you write?" he demanded, when he had the horse under control
  again.</p>

  <p>"A month ago."</p>

  <p>Norbanus lapsed into a moody silence, critically staring at his friend
  when he was sure the other was not looking. Sextus had always puzzled him by
  running risks that other men (himself, for instance) steadfastly avoided, and
  avoiding risks that other men thought insignificant. To write a letter
  critical of Commodus was almost tantamount to suicide, since every Roman port
  and every resthouse on the roads that led to Rome had become infested with
  informers who were paid on a percentage basis.</p>

  <p>"Are you weary of life?" he asked after a while.</p>

  <p>"I am weary of Commodus&mdash;weary of tyranny&mdash;weary of lies and
  hypocrisy&mdash;weary of wondering what is to happen to Rome that submits
  to such bestial government&mdash;weary of shame and of the insolence of
  bribe-fat magistrates&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Weary of your friends?" Norbanus asked. "Don't you realize that if your
  letter fell into the hands of spies, not only will you be proscribed and your
  father executed, but whoever is known to have been intimate with you or with
  your father will be in almost equal danger? You should have gone to Rome in
  person to consult your father."</p>

  <p>"He ordered me to stay here to protect his interests. We are rich,
  Norbanus. We have much property in Antioch and many tenants to oversee. I am
  not one of these modern irreligious wastrels; I obey my father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And betray him in an idiotic letter!"</p>

  <p>"Very well! Desert me while there is time!" said Sextus angrily.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool! You are not the only proud man in the empire, Sextus. I
  don't desert my friend for such a coward's reason as that he acted
  thoughtlessly. But I will tell you what I think, whether or not that pleases
  you, if only because I am your true friend. You are a rash, impatient lover
  of the days gone by, possessed of genius that you betray by your arrogant
  hastiness. So now you know what I think, and what all your other friends
  think. We admire&mdash;we love our Sextus, son of Maximus. And we confess
  to ourselves that our lives are in danger because of that same Sextus, son of
  Maximus, whom we prefer above our safety. After this, if you continue to
  deceive yourself, none can blame me for it!"</p>

  <p>Sextus smiled and waved a hand to him. It was no new revelation. He
  understood the attitude of all his friends far better than he did his own
  strange impulses that took possession of him as a rule when circumstances
  least provided an excuse.</p>

  <p>"My theory of loyalty to friendship," he remarked, "is that a man should
  dare to do what he perceives is right, and thus should prove himself entitled
  to respect."</p>

  <p>"And your friends are, in consequence, to enjoy the privilege of attending
  your crucifixion one of these days!" said Norbanus.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. Only slaves and highwaymen are crucified."</p>

  <p>"They call anyone a highwayman who is a fugitive from what our 'Roman
  Hercules' calls justice," Norbanus answered with a gesture of irritation. His
  own trick of finishing people's sentences did not annoy Sextus nearly as much
  as Sextus's trick of pounding on inaccuracies irritated him. He pressed his
  horse into a canter and for a while they rode beside the stream called the
  "Donkey-drowner" without further conversation, each man striving to subdue
  the ill-temper that was on the verge of outbreak.</p>

  <p>Romans of the old school valued inner calm as highly as they did the outer
  semblances of dignity; even the more modern Romans imitated that distinctive
  attitude, pretending to Augustan* calmness that had actually ceased to be a
  part of public life. But with Sextus and Norbanus the inner struggle to be
  self-controlled was genuine; they bridled irritation in the same way that
  they forced their horses to obey them&mdash;captains of their own souls, as
  it were, and scornful of changefulness.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Augustan</i> (63 BCE-14 CE)&mdash;an allusion to
  the first Roman emperor, Augustus, a grandson of the sister of Julius Caesar.
  Named at first Caius Octavius, he became on adoption by the Julian gens (44
  BCE) Caius Julius Caesar Octavianus (Octavian); Augustus was a title of honor
  granted (27 B.C.) by the Senate... <i><a href=

  <p>Sextus, being the only son of a great landowner, and raised in the
  traditions of a secluded valley fifty leagues away from Rome, was almost half
  a priest by privilege of ancestry. He had been educated in the local priestly
  college, had himself performed the daily sacrifices that tradition imposed on
  the heads of families and, in his father's frequent absence, had attended to
  all the details and responsibilities of managing a large estate. The gods of
  wood and stream and dale were very real to him. The daily offering, from each
  meal, to the <i>manes</i> of his ancestors, whose images in wax and wood and
  marble were preserved in the little chapel attached to the old brick
  homestead, had inspired in him a feeling that the past was forever present
  and a man's thoughts were as important as his deeds.</p>

  <p>Norbanus, on the other hand, a younger son of a man less amply dowered
  with wealth and traditional authority, had other reasons for adopting, rather
  than inheriting, an attitude toward life not dissimilar from that of Sextus.
  Gods of wood and stream to him meant very little, and he had not family
  estates to hold him to the ancient views. To him the future was more real
  than the past, which he regarded as a state of ignorance from which the world
  was tediously struggling. But inherently he loved life's decencies, although
  he mocked their sentimental imitations; and he followed Sextus&mdash;
  squandered hours with him, neglecting his own interests (which after all were
  nothing too important and were well enough looked after by a Syracusan
  slave), simply because Sextus was a manly sort of fellow whose friendship
  stirred in him emotions that he felt were satisfying. He was a born follower.
  His ugly face and rather mirth-provoking blue eyes, the loose, beautifully
  balanced seat on horseback and the cavalry-like carriage of his shoulders,
  served their notice to the world at large that he would stick to friends of
  his own choosing and for purely personal reasons, in spite of, and in the
  teeth of anything.</p>

  <p>"As I said," remarked Sextus, "if Pertinax comes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He will show us how foolish a soldier can be in the arms of a woman,"
  Norbanus remarked, laughing again, glad the long silence was broken.</p>

  <p>"Orcus* take his women! What I was going to say was, we shall learn from
  him the real news from Rome."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Orcus</i>&mdash;the messenger of Dis, who carried
  dead souls to the underworld. The masked slaves who dragged dead gladiators
  out of the arena were disguised to represent Orcus. Mundy's own
  footnote.]</p>

  <p>"All the names of the popular dancers!"</p>

  <p>"And if Galen* is there we shall learn&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Galen</i> (c.130-c.200 CE)&mdash;physician and
  writer, b. Pergamum, of Greek parents. After study in Greece and Asia Minor
  and at Alexandria, he returned to Pergamum, where he served as physician to
  the gladiatorial school. He resided chiefly in Rome from c.162 CE. Noted for
  his lectures and writings, he established a large practice and became court
  physician to Marcus Aurelius. He is credited with some 500 treatises, most of
  them on medicine and philosophy; at least 83 of his medical works are extant.
  He correlated earlier medical knowledge in all fields with his own
  discoveries (based in part on experimentation and on dissection of animals)
  and systematized medicine in accordance with his theories, which emphasized
  purposive creation. His work in anatomy and physiology is especially notable.
  He demonstrated that arteries carry blood instead of air and added greatly to
  knowledge of the brain, nerves, spinal cord, and pulse. Until the 16th
  century his authority was virtually undisputed, thus discouraging original
  investigation and hampering medical progress. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/65/ga/Galen.html">Columbia University
  Encyclopedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"About Commodus' health. That is more to the point. Now if we could get
  into Galen's chest of medicines and substitute&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Galen is an honest doctor," Sextus interrupted. "If Galen is there we
  will find out what the philosophers are discussing in Rome when spies aren't
  listening. Pertinax dresses himself like a strutting peacock and pretends
  that women and money are his only interests, but what the wise ones said
  yesterday, Pertinax does today; and what they say today, he will do tomorrow.
  He can look more like a popinjay and act more like a man than anyone in
  Rome."</p>

  <p>"Who cares how they behave in Rome? The city has gone mad," Norbanus
  answered. "Nowadays the best a man can do is to preserve his own goods and
  his own health. Ride to a conference do we? Well, nothing but words will come
  of it, and words are dangerous. I like my danger tangible and in the open
  where it can be faced. Three times last week I was approached by Glyco
&mdash;you remember him?&mdash;that son of Cocles and the Jewess&mdash;
  asking me to join a secret mystery of which he claims to be the
  inextinguishable lamp. But there are too many mysteries and not enough plain
  dealing. The only mystery about Glyco is how he avoids indictment for
  conspiracy&mdash;what with his long nose and sly eyes, and his way of
  hinting that he knows enough to turn the world upside down. If Pertinax talks
  mystery I will class him with the other foxes who slink into holes when the
  agenda look like becoming acta. Show me only a raised standard in an open
  field and I will take my chance beside it. But I sicken of all this talk of
  what we might do if only somebody had the courage to stick a dagger into
  Commodus."</p>

  <p>"The men who could persuade themselves to do that, are persuaded that a
  worse brute might succeed him," Sextus answered. "It is no use killing a
  Commodus to find a Nero in his shoes. If the successor were in sight&mdash;
  and visibly a man not a monster&mdash;there are plenty of men brave enough
  to give the dagger-thrust. But the Praetorian Guard,* that makes and unmakes
  emperors, has been tasting the sweets of tyranny ever since Marcus Aurelius
  died. They despise their 'Roman Hercules' (Commodus' favorite name for
  himself)&mdash;who doesn't? But they grow fat and enjoy themselves under
  his tyranny, so they would never consent to leaving him unguarded, as
  happened to Nero, for instance, or to replacing him with anyone of the
  caliber of Aurelius, if such a man could be found."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Praetorian Guard</i> (Latin: "praetoriani")&mdash;
  a special force of bodyguards used by Roman Emperors. Before the Emperors,
  the guard was employed under warlords, dating at least to the Scipio family

  most skilled and celebrated warriors in ancient history ... <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"Well, then, what do we go to talk about?" Norbanus asked.</p>

  <p>"We go for information."</p>

  <p>"Dea Dia!* We inform ourselves that Rome has been renamed 'The City of
  Commodus'&mdash;that offices are bought and sold&mdash;that there were
  forty consuls in a year, each of whom paid for the office in turn&mdash;
  that no man's life is safe&mdash;that it is wiser to take a cold in the
  head to Galen than to kiss a mule's nose (it was a common superstition that a
  cold in the head could be cured by kissing a mule's nose)&mdash;and then
  what? I begin to think that Pertinax is wiser to amuse himself with women
  after all!"</p>

  corn and agriculture, identified with Ceres (various sources). In his own
  comment Mundy calls Dea Dia "the most mysterious of all the Roman deities."

  <p>Sextus edged his horse a little closer to the skewbald and for more than a
  minute appeared to be studying Norbanus' face, the other grinning at him and
  making the stallion prance.</p>

  <p>"Are you never serious?" asked Sextus.</p>

  <p>"Always and forever, melancholy friend of mine! I seriously dread the
  consequences of that letter that you wrote to Rome! Unlike you, I have not
  much more than life to lose, but I value it all the more for being less
  encumbered. Like Apollonius,* I pray for few possessions and no needs! But
  what I have, I treasure; I propose to live long and make use of life!"</p>

  <p>"And I!" retorted Sextus.</p>

  <p>With a gesture of disgust, he turned to stare behind him at the crowd on
  its way to Daphne, making such a business of pleasure as reduced the pleasure
  to a toil of Sisyphus (who had to roll a heavy stone perpetually up a steep
  hill in the underworld. Before he reached the top the stone always rolled
  down again).</p>

  <p>"I have more than gold," said Sextus, "which it seems to me that any
  crooked-minded fool may have. I have a spirit in me and a taste for
  philosophies; I have a feeling that a man's life is a gift entrusted to him
  by the gods&mdash;for use&mdash;to be preserved&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By writing foolish letters, doubtless!" said Norbanus. "Come along, let
  us gallop. I am weary of the backs of all these roisterers."</p>

  <p>And so they rode to Daphne full pelt, greatly to the anger of the too well
  dressed Antiochians, who cursed them for the mud they splashed from wayside
  pools and for the dung and dust they kicked up into plucked and penciled
  faces.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">CHAPTER 2.</a><br>
  A Conference At Daphne</h2>

  <p class="first">It was not yet dusk. The sun shone on the bronze roof of the
  temple of Apollo, making such a contrast to, and harmony with, marble and the
  green of giant cypresses as only music can suggest. The dying breeze stirred
  hardly a ripple on the winding ponds, so marble columns, trees and statuary
  were reflected amid shadows of the swans in water tinted by the colors of the
  sinking sun. There was a murmur of wind in the tops of the trees and a
  stirring of linen-clad girls near the temple entrance&mdash;voices droning
  from the nearby booths behind the shrubbery&mdash;one flute, like the
  plaint of Orpheus summoning Eurydice&mdash;a blossom-scented air and an
  enfolding mystery of silence.</p>

  <p>Pertinax, the governor of Rome, had merely hinted at Olympian desire,
  whereat some rich Antiochians, long privileged, had been ejected with scant
  ceremony from a small marble pavilion on an islet, formed by a branch of the
  River Ladon that had been guided twenty years ago by Hadrian's engineers in
  curves of exquisitely studied beauty. From between Corinthian columns was a
  view of nearly all the temple precincts and of the lawns where revelers would
  presently forget restraint. The first night of the Daphne season usually was
  the wildest night of all the year, but they began demurely, and for the
  present there was the restraint of expectation.</p>

  <p>Because there was yet snow on mountaintops and the balmy air would carry a
  suggestion of a chill at sunset, there were cunningly wrought charcoal
  braziers set near the gilded couches, grouped around a semicircular low table
  so as to give each guest an unobstructed view from the pavilion. Pertinax
&mdash;neither guest nor host, but a god, as it were, who had arrived and
  permitted the city of Antioch to ennoble itself by paying his expenses
&mdash;stretched his long length on the middle couch, with Galen the
  physician on his right hand, Sextus on his left. Beyond Galen lay Tarquinius
  Divius and Sulpicius Glabrio, friends of Pertinax; and on Sextus' left was
  Norbanus, and beyond him Marcus Fabius a young tribune* on Pertinax' staff.
  There was only one couch unoccupied.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>tribune</i> (Latin: "tribunus")&mdash;a title
  shared by several elected magistracies and other governmental and/or
  (para)military offices of the Roman Republic and Empire... The "tribunes of
  the plebs" were elected by the plebeians to protect their rights from
  arbitrary acts of the patrician magistrates ... Each Roman legion had six
  "military tribunes", who were senior officers ranking after the legate
  (commander); one tribune, the second in command, was entitled the "tribunus
  laticlavius" and was drawn from the senatorial class and beginning his
  career, the other five were from the equestrian class and were in the midst
  of their career progression. Various sources. For more detail, see <a href=

  Ancient History</a>. ]</p>

  <p>Galen was an older man than Pertinax, who was already graying at the
  temples. Galen had the wrinkled, smiling, shrewd face of an old philosopher
  who understood the trick of making himself socially prominent in order to
  pursue his calling unimpeded by the bitter jealousies of rivals. He
  understood all about charlatanry, mocked it in all its disguises and knew how
  to defeat it with sarcastic wit. He wore none of the distinguishing insignia
  that practicing physicians usually favored; the studied plainness of his
  attire was a notable contrast to the costly magnificence of Pertinax, whose
  double-purple-bordered and fringed toga, beautifully woven linen and jeweled
  ornaments seemed chosen to combine suggestions of the many public offices he
  had succeeded to.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, lean, handsome veteran with naturally curly fair hair and a
  beard that, had it been dark, would have made him look like an Assyrian.
  There was a world of humor in his eyes, and an expression on his weathered
  face of wonder at the ways of men&mdash;an almost comical confession of his
  own inferiority of birth, combined with matter-of-fact ability to do whatever
  called for strength, endurance and mere ordinary common sense.</p>

  <p>"You are almost ashamed of your own good fortune," Galen told him. "You
  wear all that jewelry, and swagger like the youngest tribune, to conceal your
  diffidence. Being honest, you are naturally frugal; but you are ashamed of
  your own honesty, so you imitate the court's extravagance and make up for it
  with little meannesses that comfort your sense of extremes. The truth is,
  Pertinax, you are a man with a boy's enthusiasms, a boy with a man's
  experience."</p>

  <p>"You ought to know," said Pertinax. "You tutored Commodus. Whoever could
  take a murderer at the age of twelve and keep him from breaking the heart of
  a Marcus Aurelius knows more about men and boys than I do."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but I failed," said Galen. "The young Commodus was like a nibbling
  fish; you thought you had him, but he always took the bait and left the hook.
  The wisdom I fed to him fattened his wickedness. If I had known then what I
  have learned from teaching Commodus and others, not even Marcus Aurelius
  could have persuaded me to undertake the task&mdash;medical problem though
  it was, and promotion though it was, and answer though it was to all the
  doctors who denounced me as a charlatan. I bought my fashionable practise at
  the cost of knowing it was I who taught young Commodus the technique of
  wickedness by revealing to him all its sinuosities and how, and why, it
  floods a man's mind."</p>

  <p>"He was a beast in any case," said Pertinax.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but a baffled, blind beast. I removed the bandage from his
  eyes."</p>

  <p>"He would have pulled it off himself."</p>

  <p>"I did it. I turned a mere golden-haired savage into a criminal who knows
  what he is doing."</p>

  <p>"Well, drink and forget it!" said Pertinax. "I, too, have done things that
  are best forgotten. We attain success by learning from defeat, and we forget
  defeat in triumph. I know of no triumph that did not blot out scores of worse
  things than defeat. When I was in Britain I subdued rebellion and restored
  the discipline of mutinying legions. How? I am not such a fool as to tell you
  all that happened! When I was in Africa men called me a great proconsul. So I
  was. They would welcome me back there, if all I hear about the present man is
  true. But do you suppose I did not fail in certain instances? They praise me
  for the aqueducts I built, and for the peace I left along the border. But I
  also left dry bones, and sons of dead men who will teach their grandsons how
  to hate the name of Rome! I sent a hundred thousand slaves from Africa.
  Sometimes, when I have dined unwisely and there is no Galen near to freshen
  up my belly juices, I have nightmares, in which men and women cry to me for
  water that I took from them to pour into the cities. I have learned this,
  Galen: Do one thing wisely and you will commit ten follies. You are lucky if
  you have but ten failures to detract from one success&mdash;as lucky as a
  man who has but ten mistresses to interfere with his enjoyment of his
  wife!"</p>

  <p>He spoke of mistresses because the girls were coming down the temple steps
  to take part in the sunset ceremony. The torches they carried were unlighted
  yet; their figures, draped in linen, looked almost superhumanly lovely in the
  deepening twilight, and as they laid their garlands on the marble altar near
  the temple steps and grouped themselves again on either side of it their
  movements suggested a phantasmagoria fading away into infinite distance, as
  if all the universe were filled with women without age or blemish. There
  began to be a scent of incense in the air.</p>

  <p>"We only imitate this kind of thing in Rome," said Pertinax. "A larger
  scale, a coarser effect. What I find thrilling is the sensation they contrive
  here of unseen mysteries. Whereas&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There won't be any mystery left presently! They'll strip your last veil
  from imagination!" Sextus interrupted, laughing. "Men say Hadrian tried to
  chasten this place, but he only made them realize the artistic value of an
  appearance of chastity, that can be thrown off. Hark! The evening hymn."</p>

  <p>The torches suddenly were lighted by attendant slaves. The stirring,
  shaken sistra* wrought a miracle of sound that set the nerves all tingling as
  the high priest, followed by his boys with swinging censers and the members
  of the priestly college, four by four, came chanting down the temple steps.
  To an accompanying pleading, sobbing note of flutes the high priest laid an
  offering of fruit, milk, wine and honey in the midst of the heaped-up
  garlands (for Apollo was the god of all fertility as well as of healing and
  war and flocks and oracles). Then came the grand Homeric hymn to Glorious
  Apollo, men's and boys' and women's voices blending in a surging paean like
  an ocean's music.</p>

  rings or loops of thin metal on its moveable crossbars produce a sound that
  can range from a soft tinkling to a loud jangling. <i><a href=

  <p>The last notes died away in distant echoes. There was silence for a
  hundred breaths; then music of flute and lyre and sistra as the priests
  retreated up the temple steps followed by fanfare on a dozen trumpets as the
  door swung to behind the priests. Instantly, then, shouts of laughter&mdash;
  torchlight scattering the shadows amid gloom&mdash;green cypresses&mdash;
  fire&mdash;color splurging on the bosom of the water&mdash;babel of
  hundreds of voices as the gay Antiochians swarmed out from behind the trees
&mdash;and a cheer, as the girls by the altar threw their garments off and
  scampered naked along the riverbank toward a bridge that joined the temple
  island to the sloping lawns, where the crowd ran to await them.</p>

  <p>"Apollo having healed the world of sin, we now do what we like!" said
  Sextus. "Pertinax, I pledge you continence for this one night! Good Galen,
  may Apollo's wisdom ooze from you like sweat; for all our sakes, be you the
  arbiter of what we drink, lest drunkenness deprive us of our reason!
  Comites,* let us eat like warriors&mdash;one course, and then discussion of
  tomorrow's plan."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>comes</i> (Latin; plural: <i>comites</i> )&mdash;
  comrade, companion, associate, fellow-soldier. For more information on this
  term and its use, see the article in <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comes"><i>Wikipedia</i></a>. ]</p>

  <p>"Your military service should have taught you more respect for your
  seniors, as well as how to eat and drink temperately," said Pertinax. "Will
  you teach your grandmother to suck eggs? I was the first grammarian in Rome
  before you were born and a tribune before you felt down on your cheek. I am
  the governor of Rome, my boy. Who are you, that you should lecture me?"</p>

  <p>"If you call that a lecture, concede that I dared," Sextus answered. "I
  did not flatter you by coming here, or come to flatter you. I came because my
  father tells me you are a Roman beyond praise. I am a Roman. I believe praise
  is worthless unless proven to the hilt&mdash;as for instance: I have come
  to bare my thoughts to you, which is a bold compliment in these days of
  treachery."</p>

  <p>"Keep your thoughts under cover," said Pertinax, glancing at the steward
  and the slaves who were beginning to carry in the meal. But he was evidently
  pleased, and Sextus's next words pleased him more:</p>

  <p>"I am ready to do more than think about you, I will follow where you lead
&mdash;except into licentiousness!"</p>

  <p>He lay on both elbows and stared at the scene with disgust. Naked girls,
  against a background of the torchlit water and the green and purple gloom of
  cypresses, was nothing to complain of; statuary, since it could not move, was
  not as pleasing to the eye; but shrieks of idiotic laughter and debauchery of
  beauty sickened him.</p>

  <p>There came a series of sounds at the pavilion entrance, where a litter was
  set down on marble pavement and a eunuch's shrill voice criticized the slow
  unrolling of a carpet.</p>

  <p>"What did I warn you?" Norbanus whispered, laughing in Sextus's ear.</p>

  <p>Pertinax got to his feet, long-leggedly statuesque, and strode toward the
  antechamber on his right, whence presently he returned with a woman on his
  arm, he stroking her hand as it rested on his. He introduced Sextus and
  Norbanus; the others knew her; Galen greeted her with a wrinkled grin that
  seemed to imply confidence.</p>

  <p>"Now that Cornificia has come, not even Sextus need worry about our
  behavior!" said Galen, and everybody except Sextus grinned. It was notorious
  that Cornificia refined and restrained Pertinax, whereas his lawful wife
  Flavia Titiana merely drove him to extremes.</p>

  <p>This Roman Aspasia had an almost Grecian face, beneath a coiled
  extravagance of dark brown hair. Her violet eyes were quietly intelligent;
  her dress plain white and not elaborately fringed, with hardly any jewelry.
  She cultivated modesty and all the older graces that had grown unfashionable
  since the Emperor Marcus Aurelius died. In all ways, in fact, she was the
  opposite of Flavia Titiana&mdash;it was hard to tell whether from natural
  preference or because the contrast to his wife's extremes of noisy gaiety and
  shameless license gave her a stronger hold on Pertinax. Rome's readiest
  slanderers had nothing scandalous to tell of Cornificia, whereas Flavia
  Titiana's inconstancies were a by-word.</p>

  <p>She refused to let Galen yield the couch on Pertinax's right hand but took
  the vacant one at the end of the half-moon table, saying she preferred it
&mdash;which was likely true enough; it gave her a view of all the faces
  without turning her head or appearing to stare.</p>

  <p>For a long time there was merely desultory conversation while the feast,
  restricted within moderate proportions by request of Pertinax, was brought
  on.</p>

  <p>There were eels, for which Daphne was famous; alphestes and callichthys;
  pompilos, a purple fish, said to have been born from sea-foam at the birth of
  Aphrodite; boops and bedradones; gray mullet; cuttle-fish; tunny-fish and
  mussels. Followed in their order pheasants, grouse, swan, peacock and a large
  pig stuffed with larks and mincemeat. Then there were sweetmeats of various
  kinds, and a pudding invented in Persia, made with honey and dates, with a
  sauce of frozen cream and strawberries. By Galen's order only seven sorts of
  wine were served, so when the meal was done the guests were neither drunk nor
  too well fed to carry on a conference.</p>

  <p>No entertainers were provided. Normally the space between the table and
  the front of the pavilion would have been occupied by acrobats, dancers and
  jugglers; but Pertinax dismissed even the impudent women who came to lean
  elbows on the marble railing and sing snatches of suggestive song. He sent
  slaves to stand outside and keep the crowd away, his lictor* and his personal
  official bodyguard being kept out of sight in a small stone house near the
  pavilion kitchen at the rear among the trees, in order not to arouse
  unwelcome comment. It was known he was in Daphne; there was even a subdued
  expectation in Antioch that his unannounced visit portended the extortion of
  extra tribute. The Emperor Commodus was known to be in his usual straits for
  money. Given a sufficient flow of wine, the sight of bodyguard and lictor
  might have been enough to start a riot, the Antiochians being prone to
  outbreak when their passions were aroused by drink and women.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>lictor</i> (Latin)&mdash;a member of a special
  class of Roman civil servant, with special tasks of attending magistrates of
  the Roman Republic and Empire who held imperium. The origin of the tradition
  of lictors goes back to the time when Rome was a kingdom, perhaps acquired by
  their Etruscan neighbors ... The lictor's main task was to attend as
  bodyguards to magistrates ... <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lictor">Wikipedia</a></i>.]</p>

  <p>There was a long silence after Pertinax had dismissed the steward. Galen's
  old personal attendant took charge of the amphora of snow-cooled Falernian;*
  he poured for each in turn and then retired into a corner to be out of
  earshot, or at any rate to emphasize that what he might hear would not
  concern him.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Falernian</i> (Latin: "vinum Falernum")&mdash;In
  ancient Rome, the preferred wines came from Campania, from the plain area
  between sea and mountain, crossed by the Volturno River. Because of its
  unique climate this region was called Campania Felix. The most famous wine
  was the Falernum (today known as Falerno), produced at the slopes of the
  Mount Massico in the province of Caserta. It was made with Aglianico and
  Falanghina grapes grown on ancient vines brought there by the Greeks 3,000
  years ago. Red Falernum was made with from Aglianico grapes, white Falernum
  from Falanghina grapes. Falernum is the "emperors' wine" described by the
  Latin poets. It was so famous that Roman ships delivered it everywhere in the
  known world. <i><a href=

  <p>Pertinax strolled to the front of the pavilion and looked out to make sure
  there were no eavesdroppers, staring for a long time at the revelry that was
  warming up into an orgy. They were dancing in rings under the moon, their
  shadowy figures rendered weird by smoky torchlight. Cornificia at last broke
  on his reverie:</p>

  <p>"You wish to join them, Pertinax? That would dignify even our Roman
  Hercules&mdash;to say nothing of you!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, but his eyes were glittering.</p>

  <p>"If Marcia could govern Commodus as you rule me, he would be safer on the
  throne!" he answered, coming to sit upright on the couch beside her. It was
  evident that he intended that speech to release all tongues; he looked from
  face to face expectantly, but no one spoke until Cornificia urged him to
  protect himself against the night breeze. He threw a purple-bordered cloak
  over his shoulders. It became him; he looked so official in it, and majestic,
  that even Sextus&mdash;rebel that he was against all modern trumpery
&mdash;forbore to break the silence. It was Galen who spoke next:</p>

  <p>"Pertinax, if you might choose an emperor, whom would you nominate?
  Remember: He must be a soldier, used to the stench of marching legions. None
  could govern Rome whose nose goes up in the air at the smell of sweat and
  garlic."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of approval. Cornificia stroked the long, strong
  fingers of the man she idolized. Sextus gave rein to his impulse then,
  brushing aside Norbanus' hand that warned him to bide his time:</p>

  <p>"Many more than I," he said, "are ready to throw in our lot with you,
  Pertinax&mdash;aye, unto death! You would restore Rome's honor. I believe
  my father could persuade a hundred noblemen to take your part, if you would
  lead. I can answer for five or six men of wealth and influence, not reckoning
  a friend or two who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why talk foolishness!" said Pertinax. "The legions will elect Commodus'
  successor. They will sell Rome to the highest bidder, probably; and though
  they like me as a soldier they dislike my discipline. I am the governor of
  Rome and still alive in spite of it because even Commodus' informers know it
  would be silly to accuse me of intrigue. Not even Commodus would listen to
  such talk. I lead the gay life, for my own life's sake. All know me as a
  roisterer. I am said to have no ambition other than to live life
  sensuously."</p>

  <p>Galen laughed.</p>

  <p>"That may deceive Commodus," he said. "The thoughtful Romans know you as a
  frugal governor, who stamped out plague and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You did that," said Pertinax.</p>

  <p>"Who enabled me?"</p>

  <p>"It was a simple thing to have the tenements burned. Besides, it profited
  the city&mdash;new streets; and there was twice the amount of tax on the
  new tenements they raised. I, personally, made a handsome profit on the
  purchase of a few burned houses."</p>

  <p>"And as the governor who broke the famine," Galen continued.</p>

  <p>"That was simple enough, but you may as well thank Cornificia. She found
  out through the women who the men were who were holding corn for speculation.
  All I did was to hand their names to Commodus; he confiscated all the corn
  and sold it&mdash;at a handsome profit to himself, since it had cost him
  nothing!"</p>

  <p>"While we sit here and cackle like Asian birds, Commodus renames Rome the
  City of Commodus and still lives!" Sextus grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Nor can he be easily got rid of," remarked Daedalus the tribune. "He goes
  to and fro from the palace through underground tunnels. Men sleep in his room
  who are all involved with him in cruelties and infamy, so they guard him
  carefully. Besides, whoever tried to murder him would probably kill Paulus by
  mistake! The Praetorian Guard is contented, being well paid and permitted all
  sorts of privileges. Who can get past the Praetorian Guard?"</p>

  <p>"anyone!" said Pertinax. "The point is not, who shall kill Commodus? But
  who shall be raised in his place? There are thirty thousand ways to kill a
  man. Ask Galen!"</p>

  <p>Old Galen laughed at that.</p>

  <p>"As many ways as there are stars in heaven; but the stars have their say
  in the matter! None can kill a man until his destiny says yes to it. Not even
  a doctor," he added, chuckling. "Otherwise the doctors would have killed me
  long ago with jealousy! A man dies when his inner man grows sick and weary of
  him. Then a pin-prick does it, or a sudden terror. Until that time comes you
  may break his skull, and do not more than spoil his temper! As a philosopher
  I have learned two things: respect many, but trust few. But as a doctor I
  have learned only one thing for certain: that no man actually dies until his
  soul is tired of him."</p>

  <p>"Whose soul should grow sick sooner than that of Commodus?" asked
  Sextus.</p>

  <p>"Not if his soul is evil and delights in evil&mdash;as his does!" Galen
  retorted. "If he should turn virtuous, then perhaps, yes. But in that case we
  should wish him to live, although his soul would prefer the contrary and
  leave him to die by the first form of death that should appear&mdash;in
  spite of all the doctors and the guards and tasters of the royal food."</p>

  <p>"Some one should convert him then!" said Sextus. "Cornificia, can't Marcia
  make a Christian of him; Christians pretend to oppose all the infamies he
  practices. It would be a merry joke to have a Christian emperor, who died
  because his soul was sick of him! It would be a choice jest&mdash;he being
  the one who has encouraged Christianity by reversing all Marcus Aurelius'
  wise precautions against their seditious blasphemy!"</p>

  <p>"You speak fanatically, but you have touched the heart of the problem,"
  said Cornificia. "It is Marcia who makes life possible for Commodus&mdash;
  Marcia and her Christians. They help Marcia protect him because he is the
  only emperor who never persecuted them, and because Marcia sees to it that
  they are free to meet together without having even to bribe the police. There
  is only one way to get rid of Commodus: Persuade Marcia that her own life is
  in danger from him, and that she will have a full voice in nominating his
  successor."</p>

  <p>"Probably true," remarked Pertinax. "Whom would she nominate? That is the
  point."</p>

  <p>"It would be simpler to kill Marcia," said Daedalus. "Thereafter let
  things take their course. Without Marcia to protect him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No man knows much," Galen interrupted. "Marcia's soul may be all the soul
  Commodus has! If she should grow sick of him&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"She grew sick long ago," said Cornificia. "But she is forever thinking of
  her Christians and knows no other way to protect them than to make Commodus
  love her. Ugh! It is like the story of Andromeda.* Who is to act
  Perseus?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Andromeda</i>&mdash;in Greek mythology, princess
  of Ethiopia, daughter of King Cepheus, king of Ethiopia, and Cassiopeia.
  According to most legends Cassiopeia angered Poseidon by saying that
  Andromeda (or possibly Cassiopeia herself) was more beautiful than the
  nereids. Poseidon sent a sea monster to prey upon the country; he could be
  appeased only by the sacrifice of the king's daughter. Andromeda, in
  sacrifice, was chained to a rock by the sea; but she was rescued by Perseus,
  who killed the monster and later married her. Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and
  Andromeda were all set among the stars as constellations. <i><a href=

  <p>"There are thirty thousand ways of killing," Pertinax repeated, "but if we
  kill one monster, four or five others will fight for his place, unless, like
  Perseus, we have the head of a Medusa with which to freeze them into stone!
  There is no substitute for Commodus in sight. The only man whose face would
  freeze all rivals is Severus the Carthaginian!"*</p>

  <p>"We are none of us blind," said Cornificia.</p>

  <p>"You mean me? I am too old," answered Pertinax. "I don't like tyranny, and
  people know it. It is something they should not know. An old man may be all
  very well when he has reigned for twenty years and men are used to him, and
  he used to the task, as was Augustus; but an old man new to the throne lacks
  energy. And besides, they would never endure a man whose father was a
  charcoal-seller, as mine was. I have made my way in life by looking at facts
  and refusing to deceive myself; with the exception of that, I have no
  especial wisdom, nor any unusual ability."</p>

  <p>"If wisdom were all that is needed," said Sextus, "we should put good
  Galen on the throne!"</p>

  <p>"He is too old and wise to let you try to do it!" Galen answered. "But you
  spoke about the head of a Medusa, Pertinax, and mentioned Lucius Septimius
  Severus. He commands three legions at Carnuntum* in Pannonia.&dagger; If
  there is one man living who can freeze men's blood by scowling at them, it is

  <p>"I have thought of him only to hate him," said Pertinax. "He would not
  follow me, nor I him. He is one of three men who would fight for the throne
  if somebody slew Commodus, although he would not run the risk of slaying him
  himself, and he would betray us if we should take him into confidence. I know
  him well. He is a lawyer and a Carthaginian. He would never ask for the
  nomination; he is too crafty. He would say his legions nominated him against
  his will and that to have disobeyed them would have laid him open to the
  punishment for treason.* The other two are Pescennius Niger,&dagger; who
  commands the legions in Syria, and Clodius Albinus&Dagger; who commands in

  <p>"You are he! Rome trusts you. So does the Senate," said Cornificia.
  "Marcia trusts me. The Praetorian Guard trusts her. If I can persuade Marcia
  that her life is in danger from Commodus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But how?" Daedalus interrupted.</p>

  <p>"We can take the Praetorian Guard by surprise," Cornificia went on,
  ignoring him. "They can be tricked into declaring for the man whom Marcia's
  friends nominate. Having once declared for him they will be too proud of
  having made an emperor, and too unwilling to seem vacillating, to reverse
  themselves in any man's favor, even though he should command six legions. The
  Senate will gladly accept one who has governed Rome as frugally as Pertinax
  has done. If the Senate confirms the nominee of the Praetorian Guard, the
  Roman populace will do the rest by acclamation. Then, three months of upright
  government&mdash;deification by the Senate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Pertinax laughed explosively&mdash;an honest, chesty laugh, unqualified
  by any subtleties, suggesting a trace of the peasantry from which he sprang.
  It made Cornificia wince.</p>

  <p>"Can you imagine me a god?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I can imagine you an emperor," said Sextus. "It is true; you have no
  following among the legions just at present. But I make one, and there are
  plenty of energetic men who think as I do. My friend Norbanus here will
  follow me. My father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Noises near the open window interrupted him. An argument seemed to be
  going on between the slaves whom Pertinax had set to keep the roisterers away
  and some one who demanded admission. Near at hand was a woman's voice,
  shrilling and scolding. Then another voice&mdash;Scylax, the slave who had
  ridden the red mare. Pertinax strode to the window again and leaned out.
  Cornificia whispered to Galen:</p>

  <p>"If the truth were known, he is afraid of Flavia Titiana. As a wife she is
  bad enough, but as an empress&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Galen nodded.</p>

  <p>"If you love your Pertinax," he answered, "keep him off the throne! He has
  too many scruples."</p>

  <p>She frowned, having few, which were firm and entirely devoted to Pertinax'
  fortune.</p>

  <p>"Love him? I would give him up to see him deified!" she whispered; and
  again Galen nodded, deeply understanding.</p>

  <p>"That is because you have never had children," he assured her, smiling.
  "You mother Pertinax, who is more than twice your age&mdash;just as Marcia
  has mothered that monster Commodus until her heart is breaking."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you were Pertinax' friend?"</p>

  <p>"So I am."</p>

  <p>"And his urgent adviser to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, so I was. I have changed my opinion; only the maniacs never do that.
  Pertinax would make a splendid minister for Lucius Severus; and the two of
  them could bring back the Augustan days. Persuade him to it. He must forget
  he hates him."</p>

  <p>"Let him come!" said the voice of Pertinax. He was still leaning out, with
  one hand on a marble pillar, much more interested in the moonlit view of
  revelry than in the altercation between slaves. He strolled back and stood
  smiling at Cornificia, his handsome face expressing satisfaction but a rather
  humorous amusement at his inability to understand her altogether.</p>

  <p>"Are you like all other women?" he asked. "I just saw a naked woman stab a
  man with her hairpin and kick his corpse into the shrubbery before the breath
  was out of it!"</p>

  <p>"Galen has deserted you," said Cornificia. The murder was uninteresting;
  nobody made any comment.</p>

  <p>"Not he!" Pertinax answered, and went and sat on Galen's couch. "You find
  me not man enough for the Senate to make a god of me&mdash;is that it,
  Galen?"</p>

  <p>"Too much of a man to be an emperor," said Galen, smiling amid wrinkles.
  "By observing a man's virtues one may infer what his faults are. You would
  try to rule the empire honestly, which is impossible. A more dishonest man
  would let it rule itself and claim the credit, whereas you would give the
  praise to others, who would shoulder off the work and all the blame on to
  you. An empire is like a human body, which heals itself if the head will let
  it. Too many heads&mdash;a conference of doctors&mdash;and the patient
  dies! One doctor, doing nothing with an air of confidence, and the patient
  gets well! There, I have told you more than all the Senate knows!"</p>

  <p>Came Scylax, out of breath, less menial than most men's slaves, his head
  and shoulders upright and the hand that held a letter thrust well forward as
  if what he had to do were more important than the way he did it.</p>

  <p>"This came," he said, standing beside Sextus' couch. "Cadmus brought it,
  running all the way from Antioch."</p>

  <p>His hand was trembling; evidently Cadmus had by some means learned the
  contents of the letter and had told.</p>

  <p>"I and Cadmus&mdash;" he said, and then hesitated.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;are faithful, no matter what happens."</p>

  <p>Scylax stood erect with closed lips. Sextus broke the seal, merely
  glancing at Pertinax, taking permission for granted. He frowned as he read,
  bit his lip, his face growing crimson and white alternately. When he had
  mastered himself he handed the letter to Pertinax.</p>

  <p>"I always supposed you protected my father," he said, struggling to appear
  calm. But his eyes gave the story away&mdash;grieved, mortified, indignant.
  Scylax offered him his arm to lean on. Norbanus, setting both hands on his
  shoulders from behind, obliged him to sit down.</p>

  <p>"Calm!" Norbanus whispered, "Calm! Your friends are your friends. What has
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Pertinax read the letter and passed it to Cornificia, then paced the floor
  with hands behind him.</p>

  <p>"Is that fellow to be trusted?" he asked with a jerk of his head toward
  Scylax. He seemed nearly as upset as Sextus was.</p>

  <p>Sextus nodded, not trusting himself to speak, knowing that if he did he
  would insult a man who might be guiltless in spite of appearances.</p>

  <p>"Commodus commanded me to visit Antioch, as he said, for a rest," said
  Pertinax. "The public excuse was, that I should look into the possibility of
  holding the Olympic games here. Strangely enough, I suspected nothing. He has
  been flatteringly friendly of late. Those whom I requested him to spare, he
  spared, even though their names were on his proscription list and I had no
  better excuse than that they had done no wrong! The day before I left I
  brought a list to him of names that I commended to his favor&mdash;your
  father's name among them, Sextus."</p>

  <p>Pertinax turned his back again and strode toward the window, where he
  stood like a statue framed in the luminous gloom. The only part of him that
  moved was his long fingers, weaving together behind him until the knuckles
  cracked.</p>

  <p>Cornificia, subduing her contralto voice, read the letter aloud:</p>

  <p class="letter">"To Nimius Secundus Sextus, son of Galienus Maximus, the
  freedman Rufus Glabrio sends humble greeting.<br>
  <br>
  "May the gods give solace and preserve you. Notwithstanding all your noble
  father's piety&mdash;his respect for elders and superiors&mdash;he was
  accused of treason and of blasphemy toward the emperor, by whose orders he
  was seized yesterday and beheaded the same day. The estates have already been
  seized. It is said they will be sold to Asinus Sejanus, who is probably the
  source of the accusation against your father.<br>
  <br>
  "I and three other freedmen made our escape and will attempt to reach
  Tarentum, where we will await instructions from you. Titus, the son of the
  freedman Paulinus, will convey this letter to Brundisium and thence by boat
  to Dyrrachium, whence he will send it by post in the charge of a Jew whom he
  says he can trust.<br>
  <br>
  "It is a certainty that orders will go forth to seize yourself, since the
  estates in Antioch are known to be of great value. Therefore, we your true
  friends and devoted servants, urge you to make all speed in escaping. Stay
  not to make provision for yourself, but travel without encumbrances. Hide!
  Hasten!<br>
  <br>
  "We commend this letter to you as a sure proof that we ourselves are to be
  trusted, since, if it should fall into the hands of an informer by the way,
  our lives undoubtedly would pay the forfeit. We have not much money, but
  enough for the expenses of a journey to a foreign land. The place where we
  will hide near Tarentum is known to you. In deep anxiety, and not without
  such sacrifices to the gods and to the <i>manes</i> of your noble ancestors
  as means permit, we will await your coming.<br>
  <br>
  RUFUS GLABRIO, Freedman of the illustrious Galienus Maximus."</p>

  <p>Pertinax turned from the window. "The Jews have a saying," he said, "that
  who keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from trouble. Often I
  warned Maximus that he was too free with his speech. He counted too much on
  my protection. Now it remains to be seen whether Commodus has not proscribed
  me!"</p>

  <p>Sextus and Norbanus stood together, Scylax behind them, Norbanus
  whispering; plainly enough Norbanus was urging patience&mdash;discretion
&mdash;deliberate thought, whereas Sextus could hardly think at all for
  anger that reddened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you? What can I do?" wondered Pertinax.</p>

  <p>Then Cornificia was on her feet.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing&mdash;nothing you can do!" she insisted. She avoided
  Galen's eyes; the old philosopher was watching her as if she were the subject
  of some new experiment. "Let Commodus learn as much as that Sextus was here
  in this pavilion and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sextus interrupted, very proudly:</p>

  <p>"I will not endanger my friends. Who will lend me a dagger? This toy that
  I wear is too short and not sharp. You may forget me, Pertinax. My slaves
  will bury me. But play you the man and save Rome!"</p>

  <p>Then the tribune spoke up. He was younger than all of them.</p>

  <p>"Sextus is right. They will know he was here. They will probably torture
  his slaves and learn about that letter that has reached him. If he runs and
  hides, we shall all be accused of having helped him to escape; whereas
&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?" Galen asked him as he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"If he dies by his own hand, he will not only save all his slaves from the
  torture but remove the suspicion from us and we will still be free to mature
  our&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cowardice!" Norbanus finished the sentence for him.</p>

  <p>"Aye, some of us would hardly feel like noble Romans!" Pertinax said
  grimly. "Possibly I can protect you, Sextus. Let us think of some great favor
  you can do the emperor, providing an excuse for me to interfere. I might even
  take you to Rome with me and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Galen laughed, and Cornificia drew in her breath, bit her lip.</p>

  <p>"Why do you laugh, Galen?" Pertinax strode over to him and stood
  staring.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Galen, "I know so little after all. I cannot tell a
  beast's blood from a man's. Our Commodus would kill you with all the more
  peculiar enjoyment because he has flattered you so often publicly and called
  you 'father Pertinax.' He poisoned his own father; why not you? They will
  tell him you have frequently befriended Sextus. They will show him Sextus'
  father's name on that list of names that you commended to his favor. Do you
  follow me?"</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter, not I!" said Pertinax.</p>

  <p>"He is sure to learn about this letter that has come." said Galen. "If
  you, in fearful loyalty to Commodus, should instantly attempt to make a
  prisoner of Sextus; if, escaping, he is killed, and you bear witness&mdash;
  that would please Commodus almost as much as to see gladiators killed in the
  arena. If you wept over the death of Sextus, that would please him even more.
  He would enjoy your feelings. Do you remember how he picked two gladiators
  who were brothers&mdash;twins they were&mdash;and when the slayer of his
  twin-brother saluted, Commodus got down into the arena and kissed him? You
  yourself must announce to him the news of Sextus' death, and he will kiss you
  also!"</p>

  <p>"Vale!" remarked Sextus. "I die willingly enough."</p>

  <p>"You are dead already," Galen answered. "Didn't Pertinax see some one's
  body kicked into the bushes?"</p>

  <p>There was silence. They all glanced at one another. Only Galen, sipping at
  his wine, seemed philosophically calm.</p>

  <p>"I personally should not be an eye-witness," Galen remarked. "I am a
  doctor, whose certificate of death not even Commodus would doubt. In the dark
  I might recognize Sextus' garments, even though I could not see his features.
  And&mdash;" he added pointedly&mdash;"neither I nor anyone can tell a
  beast's blood from a man's."</p>

  <p>"Daedalus!" said Pertinax with sudden resolution. "Get my purse. My slave
  has it. Sextus shall not go empty-handed."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">CHAPTER 3.</a><br>
  Maternus-Latro</h2>

  <p class="first">Norbanus brought the skewbald stallion. Not far away a group
  of women danced around a dozen drunken men, who sang uproariously. Seen
  against the background of purple and dark-green gloom, with crimson
  torchlight flaring on the quiet water and the moon descending behind trees
  beyond them, they were mystically beautiful&mdash;seemed not to belong to
  earth, any more than the pan-pipe music did.</p>

  <p>"Ride into their midst!" Norbanus urged, pointing. "Tickle the stallion
  thus."</p>

  <p>The Cappadocian lashed out savagely.</p>

  <p>"Here is a bottle of goat's blood. I will bring weapons, and I will join
  you as soon as possible after I have made sure that the temple priests, and
  all Daphne, are positive about your death. Now mount and ride!"</p>

  <p>Sextus swung on to the stallion's back as if a catapult had thrown him.
  Until then he had let others do the ordering; he had preferred to let them
  take their own precautions, form their own plans and subject himself to any
  course they wished, after which he should be free to face his destiny and
  fight it without feeling he had handicapped his friends by wilfulness. He had
  not even issued a direct command to Scylax, his own slave. That was
  characteristic of him. Nor was it at his suggestion that Norbanus volunteered
  to share his outlawry. But it was also characteristic that he made no gesture
  of dissent; he accepted Norbanus' loyalty with a quiet smile that rather
  scorned words as unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Now he drove his heels into the Cappadocian with vigor, for the die was
  cast. The stallion, impatient of new mastery, reared and plunged, snorted,
  came back on the bit in an attempt to get it in his teeth, and bolted
  straight for the group of roisterers, who scattered away, men swearing, women
  screaming. Throwing back his weight against the reins, he brought the
  stallion to a plunging, snorting, wheeling halt in the midst of men and women
&mdash;a terrifying monster blowing clouds of mist out of his nostrils! As
  they ran he let the brute rear&mdash;pulled him over&mdash;rolled from
  under him, and lay still, with goat's blood from the broken bottle splashed
  around his face and seeming to flow from his mouth. One woman stooped to
  look, groped for a purse or anything of value, screamed and ran.</p>

  <p>"Sextus!" she yelled. "Sextus who was dining in the white pavilion!"</p>

  <p>Sextus crawled among the oleanders. Presently Norbanus came, hurrying out
  of gloom, accompanied by Cadmus, the slave who had brought from Antioch the
  letter that came from Rome. They were dragging a body between them. They laid
  it down exactly where Sextus had fallen from the horse. There was a sickening
  thwack as Cadmus made the face unrecognizable. Then came the lanky, hurrying
  figure of Pertinax leading a group of people, Cornificia among them&mdash;
  Galen last.</p>

  <p>Sextus lay still until all their backs were toward him. Then he crept out
  of the oleanders and walked along the river-bank in no haste, masking his
  face with a fold of his toga. He chose a path that wound amid the shrubbery,
  where marble satyrs grinned in colored lantern light. He had to avoid couples
  here and there. A woman followed him, laying a hand on his arm; he struck
  her, and she ran off, screaming for her bully.</p>

  <p>Presently he reached the winding track that led toward the high-road, with
  the gloom of cypresses on either hand and, beyond that, the glow of the
  lights in the caterers' booths. He was as safe now as if he were fifty miles
  away; none noticed him except the beggars at the bridges, who exposed maimed
  limbs and whined for charity. A leper, banking on his only stock in trade
&mdash;the dread men had of his affliction&mdash;cursed him.</p>

  <p>"You waste breath," said Sextus and passed on. He was smiling to himself
&mdash;sardonically. "Lepers live by threats&mdash;" he thought.</p>

  <p>No more than any leper now could he expect protection from society beyond
  what he could force society to yield. He had no name, for he was dead; that
  thought amused him. Suddenly it dawned on him how safe he was, since none in
  Antioch would dare to question the word of Pertinax, backed by Galen and all
  the witnesses whom Pertinax would be sure to summon. He remembered then to
  protect the honest freedmen who had sent him warning&mdash;strode to a fire
  near a caterer's booth and burned the letter, stared at by the slaves who
  warmed their shins around the embers.</p>

  <p>One of those might have recognized him, in spite of the toga drawn over
  his face.</p>

  <p>"If anyone should ask which way Maternus went, say I have gone home," he
  commanded, and strode away into the gloom.</p>

  <p>He wondered why he had chosen the name Maternus.* Not even his remotest
  ancestor had borne it, yet it came to his lips as naturally, instantly, as if
  it were his own by right. But as he walked away it came to mind that ten, or
  possibly twelve, nights ago he and his friends had all been talking of a
  highwayman Maternus, who had robbed the caravans on the mountain road from
  Tarsus. For the moment that thought scared him. Should he change the name?
  The slaves by the embers had stared; they showed him respect, but there was a
  distinct sensation mingled with it&mdash;hardly to be wondered at! Where
  was it he heard&mdash;who told him&mdash;that Maternus had been caught?
  He could not remember.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Maternus</i> (Latin)&mdash;the name is derived
  from the Latin adjective <i>maternus</i>, meaning "motherly" or
  "maternal."]</p>

  <p>It dawned on him how difficult it is to decide what to do when the old
  familiar conditions and the expectations on which we habitually base
  decisions are all suddenly stripped away. He understood now how a general in
  the field can fail when suddenly confronted with the unknown. Shall he do
  this, or do that? There was not a habit or a circumstance to guide him. He
  must choose, the while the gods looked on and laughed!</p>

  <p>Maternus. It was a strange name to adopt, and yet he liked the sound of
  it, nor would it pass out of his mind. He tried to think of other names, but
  either they had all been borne by slaves, and were distasteful, or else by
  famous men or by his friends, whom he did not propose to wrong; he only had
  to imagine his case reversed to realize how bitterly he would resent it if an
  outlawed man should take his own name and make it notorious.</p>

  <p>Yet he perceived that notoriety would be his only refuge, paradox though
  that might be. As a mere fugitive, anonymous and having no more object than
  to live and avoid recognition, he would soon reach the end of his tether;
  there was little mercy in the world for men without a home or means. Whether
  recognized or not, he would become like a hunted animal&mdash;might, in
  fact, end as a slave unless he should prefer to prove his identity and submit
  to Commodus's executioners. Suicide would be preferable to that; but it
  seemed almost as if the gods themselves had vetoed self-destruction by
  providing that roisterer's corpse at the critical moment and putting the plan
  for its use into Galen's wise old head.</p>

  <p>He must take the field like Spartacus* of old; but he must have a goal
  more definite and more attainable than Spartacus had had. He must avoid the
  mistake that weakened Spartacus, of accepting for the sake of numbers any
  ally who might offer himself. He would have nothing whatever to do with the
  rabble of runaway slaves, whose only guiding impulse would be loot and
  license, although he knew how easy it would be to raise such an army if he
  should choose to do it. Out of any hundred outlaws in the records of a
  hundred years, some ninety-nine had come to grief through the increasing
  numbers of their following and lack of discipline; he could think of a dozen
  who had been betrayed by paid informers of the government, posing as friendly
  brigands.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Spartacus</i> (d. 71 BCE)&mdash;a Thracian
  gladiator who led a slave revolt in Italy (73-71 BCE). He defeated Roman
  armies in southern Italy, but his forces were crushed at Lucania (71), where
  Spartacus was killed and many of his troops were crucified. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/82/S0608200.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>And besides, he had no intention of adopting brigandry as a profession,
  though he realized that he must make a reputation as a brigand if he hoped to
  be anything else than a helpless fugitive. As a rebel against Commodus it
  might be possible to raise a good-sized army in a month or two, but that
  would only serve to bring the Roman armies out of camp, led by generals eager
  for cheap victories. He must be too resourceful to be taken by police&mdash;
  too insignificant to tempt the legions out of camp. Brigandry was as
  distasteful to him and as far beneath his dignity as the pursuit of brigands
  was beneath the dignity of any of those Roman generals who owed their rank to
  Commodus. For them, as for himself, the pettiness of brigandry led nowhither.
  Only one object appealed to them&mdash;fame and its perquisites. Only one
  object appealed to himself: to redeem his estates and to avenge his father.
  That could be accomplished only by the death of Commodus: He laughed, as he
  thought of himself pitted alone against Commodus, the deified, mad monster
  who could marshal the resources of the Roman empire!</p>

  <p>Such thoughts filled his mind until he reached the lonely cross-road,
  where the narrower, tree-lined road to Daphne met the great main highway
  leading northward over the mountains. There was the usual row of gibbets
  reared on rising ground against the sky by way of grim reminder to slaves and
  other would-be outlaws that the arm of Rome was long, not merciful. Five of
  the gibbets were vacant, except for an arm on one of them, that swayed in the
  wind as it hung by a cord from the wrist. The sixth had a man on it&mdash;
  dead.</p>

  <p>Scylax, who was waiting for him, rode out of the gloom on the mare,
  leading the Cappadocian, and reined in near the gibbet, not quite sure yet
  who it was who strode toward him. Scared by the stench, the horses became
  difficult to manage. The leading-rein passed around one of the gibbets.
  Sextus ran forward to help. The Cappadocian broke the rein and Scylax
  galloped after him.</p>

  <p>So Sextus stood alone beside the rough-hewn tree-trunk, to which was tied
  the body of a man who had been dead, perhaps, since sunset. He had not been
  torn yet by the vultures. Morbid curiosity&mdash;a fellow feeling for a
  victim, as the man might well be, of the same injustice that had made an
  outlaw of himself&mdash;impelled Sextus to step closer. He could not see
  the face, which was drooped forward; but there was a parchment, held spread
  on a stick, like a sail on a spar, suspended from the man's neck by a string.
  He snatched it off and held it toward the moon, now low on the horizon. There
  were only two words, smeared with red paint by a forefinger, underneath the
  official letters S.P.Q.R.:*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>S.P.Q.R.</i> (Latin)&mdash;Senatus Populusque
  Romanus, "The Senate and the People of Rome."]</p>

  <p>"Maternus-Latro."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>latro</i> (Latin)&mdash;a robber, a brigand.]</p>

  <p>He began to wonder who Maternus might have been, and how he took the first
  step that had led to crucifixion. It was hard to believe that any man would
  run that risk unless impelled to it by some injustice that had changed pride
  into savagery or else shot off all opportunity for decent living. The cruelty
  of the form of execution hardly troubled him; the possible injustice of it
  stirred him to his depths. He felt a sort of superstitious reverence for the
  victim, increased by the strange coincidence that he had made use, without
  previous reflection, of Maternus' name.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw Norbanus riding the horse that he himself had ridden that
  afternoon from Antioch to Daphne, followed on a mule by Cadmus, the slave who
  had brought the letter which had pulled the trigger that set the catapults of
  destiny in motion. Making a wide circuit, they helped Scylax catch the
  Cappadocian.</p>

  <p>Norbanus came cantering back. He was dressed for the road in a brown
  woolen tunic contributed by some one in Pertinax' suite. He shook a bag of
  money.</p>

  <p>"Cornificia was generous," he said. "Old Pertinax thought he had done well
  enough by you. She cried shame on him and threatened to send for her jewelry.
  So he borrowed money from the priests. You are as dead as that." He looked up
  at the tortured body of the robber. "What name will you take? We had better
  begin to get used to it."</p>

  <p>"It is written here," said Sextus, showing him the parchment. But the moon
  had gone down in a smother of silvery cloud; Norbanus could not see to read.
  "I am Maternus-Latro."</p>

  <p>"I was told they had crucified that fellow."</p>

  <p>"This is Maternus. Being dead, he will hardly grudge me the use of his
  name! However, I will pay him for it. He shall have fair burial. Help me down
  with him."</p>

  <p>Norbanus beckoned to the slaves, who tied the horses to a near-by tree.
  They sought in the dark for a hole that would do for a grave, since they had
  no burying tools, stumbling on a limestone slab at last, that lay amid rank
  weeds near a tomb hollowed out of the rock that had been rifled, very likely,
  centuries ago. They lowered the already stiffened body into it, with a coin
  in its fingers for Charon's ferry-fare across the Styx, then set the heavy
  slab in place, all four of them using their utmost strength.</p>

  <p>Then Sextus, having poured a little water from his hollowed hands on to
  the slab, because he had no oil, and having murmured fragments of a ritual as
  old as Rome, bidding the gods of earth and air and the unseen re-absorb into
  themselves what man no longer could perceive or cherish or destroy, turned to
  the two slaves.</p>

  <p>"Scylax," he said, "Cadmus&mdash;he who was your master is as dead as
  that man we have buried. I am not Sextus, son of Maximus. I fare forth like a
  dead man on an unknown road, now being without honor on the lips of men. Nor
  have I any claim on you, being now an outlaw, whom the law would crucify if
  ill-luck should betray my fate. Nor can I set you free, since all my
  household doubtless is already confiscated; ye belong by law to whomsoever
  Commodus may have appointed to receive my goods. Do then at your own risk, of
  your own will, what seems good to you."</p>

  <p>Being slaves, they knelt. He bade them rise.</p>

  <p>"We follow you," said Scylax, Cadmus murmuring assent.</p>

  <p>"Then the night bear witness!" Sextus turned toward the row of gibbets,
  pointing at them. "That is the risk we take together. If we escape that, you
  shall not go unrewarded from the fortune I redeem. Norbanus, you accept my
  leadership?"</p>

  <p>Norbanus chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I insist on it!" he answered. He, too, pointed at the row of gibbets. "To
  be frightened will provide us with no armor against destiny! There was little
  I had to lose; lo, I have left that for the mice to nibble! Let us see what
  destiny can do to bold men! Lead on, Sextus!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">CHAPTER 4.</a><br>
  The Governors Of Rome And Antioch</h2>

  <p class="first">Dawn was sparkling on the mountain peaks; the misty violet
  of half-light crept into the passes and the sun already bathed the copper
  roofs of Antioch in gleaming gold above a miracle of greenery and marble.
  Like a sluggish, muddy stream with camel's heads afloat in it, the
  south-bound caravan poured up against the city gate and spread itself to
  await inspection by the tax-gatherers, the governor's representatives and
  the police. There was a tedious procedure of examination, hindered by the
  swarms of gossipers, the merchants' agents, smugglers, and the men to whom
  the latest news meant livelihood, who streamed out of the city gate and
  mingled with the new-comers from Asia, Bythinia, Pontus, Pisidia, Galatia and
  Cappadocia.</p>

  <p>The caravan guards piled their spears and breakfasted apart, their duty
  done. They had the air of men to whom the constantly repeated marches to and
  fro on the selfsame stage of a mountainous road had grown displeasing and
  devoid of all romance. Two were wounded. One, with a dent in the helmet that
  hung from his arm by the chin-strap, lay leaning against a rock; refused
  food, and slowly bled to death, his white face almost comically
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>A military tribune, followed by a slave with tablets, and by a mounted
  trooper for the sake of his official dignity, rode out from the city and took
  the report from the guards' decurion,* a half-breed Dacian-Italian, black-
  bearded and taciturn, who dictated it to the slave in curt, staccato
  sentences, grudging the very gesture that he made toward the wounded men. The
  tribune glanced at the report, signed it, turned his horse and rode into the
  city, disregarding the decurion's salute, his military cloak a splash of very
  bright red, seen against the limestone and above the predominant brown of the
  camels and coats of their owners. He cantered his horse when he passed
  through the gate, and there went up a clamor of newsy excitement behind him
  as group after group loosed tongues in competition of exaggeration.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>decurion</i> (Latin: "decurio")&mdash;a cavalry
  officer in command of a troop or <i>turma</i> of thirty soldiers in the army
  of the Roman Empire. In the infantry, the rank carried less prestige - a
  decurion only led a squad called a <i>contubernium</i> or "tent group" of 8
  men... <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decurions">Wikipedia</a></i>.
  ]</p>

  <p>Being bad, the news spread swiftly. The quadruple lines of columns all
  along the Corso, as the four-mile-long main thoroughfare was called, began to
  look like pier-piles in a flowing tide of men. Yellow, blue, red, striped and
  parti-colored costumes, restless as the flotsam on a mill-race, swirled into
  patterns, and broke, and re-blended. The long portico of Caesar's baths
  resounded to the hollow hum of voices. Streaming lines of slaves in the midst
  of the street were delayed by the crowd, and abused for obstructing it.
  Gossip went up like the voice of the sea to the cliffs and startled clouds of
  spray-white pigeons, faintly edged with pink against an azure sky; then
  ceased as suddenly. The news was known. Whatever Antioch knew, bored it. Nine
  days' wonders were departed long ago into the limbo of the days of Xerxes.*
  Nine hours had come to be the limit of men's interest&mdash;nine minutes
  the crucial phase of excitement, during which the balance of emotion hovered
  between rioting or laughter.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Xerxes</i> (519?-465 BCE)&mdash;King of Persia
  (486-465 BCE) who organized a vast army that defeated the Greeks at
  Thermopylae and destroyed Athens (480). After the defeat of his navy at
  Salamis (480) and of his army at Plataea (479), he retreated to Persia, where
  he was later assassinated. <i><a href=

  <p>Antioch grew quiet, conscious of the sunny weather and the springtime
  lassitude that is a luxury to masters but that slaves must overcome. The
  gangs went forth to clear the watercourses in advance of floods, whips
  cracking to inspire zeal. Wagon-loads of flowers, lowing milk-white oxen,
  white goats&mdash;even a white horse, a white ass&mdash;oil and wine in
  painted carts, whose solid wooden wheels screamed on their axles like demons
  in agony&mdash;threaded the streets to the temples, lest the gods forget
  convenience and send the floods too soon.</p>

  <p>The Forum&mdash;gilt-edged marble, tinted statuary, a mosaic pavement
  like a rich-hued carpet from the looms of Babylon&mdash;began to overflow
  with leisured men of business. Their slaves did all the worrying. The money-
  changers' clerks sat by the bags of coin, with scales and shovel and the
  tables of exchange. The chaffering began in corn-shops, where the lawless
  agreements for delivery of unsown harvests changed hands ten times in the
  hour, and bills on Rome, scrawled over with endorsements, outsped currency as
  well as outwitted the revenue men. No tax-farmer's slave could keep track of
  the flow of intangible wealth when the bills for a million sesterces* passed
  to and fro like cards in an Egyptian game. Men richer than the fabled Croesus
  carried all their wealth in leather wallets in the form of mortgages on gangs
  of slaves, certificates of ownership of cargoes, promises to pay and
  contracts for delivery of merchandise.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>sestertius</i> (Latin)&mdash;an ancient Roman
  coin. During the Roman Republic it was a small silver coin and during the
  Roman Empire it was a large bronze coin ... In older English texts the French
  form sesterce is sometimes used. The sestertius was introduced c. 211 BCE as
  a small silver coin that was one quarter of a denarius (and thus one
  hundredth of an aureus), and itself valued at ten asses... <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sestertius">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>Nine-tenths of all the clamor was the voice of slaves, each one of them an
  expert in his master's business and often richer than the owners of the men
  he dealt with, saving his peculium&mdash;the personal savings which slaves
  were sometimes encouraged to accumulate&mdash;to buy his freedom when a
  more than usually profitable deal should put his master in a good mood.</p>

  <p>The hall of the basilica was almost as much a place of fashion as the
  baths of Julius Caesar, except that there were some admitted into the
  basilica whose presence, later in the day, within the precincts of the baths
  would have led to a riot. Whoever had wealth and could afford to match wits
  with the sharpest traders in the world might enter the basilica and lounge
  amid the statuary. Thither well dressed slaves came hurrying with contracts
  and the news of changing prices. There, on marble benches, spread with
  colored cushions, at the rear under the balcony, the richer men of business
  sat chattering to mask their real thoughts&mdash;Jews, Alexandrians,
  Athenians&mdash;a Roman here and there, cupidity more frankly written on
  his face, his eyes a little harder and less subtle, more abrupt in gesture
  and less patient with delays.</p>

  <p>"That is a tale which is all very well for the slaves to believe, and for
  the priests, if they wish, to repeat. As for me, I was born in Tarsus, where
  no man in his senses believes anything except a bill of sale."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you, Maternus was scourged, and then crucified at the place of
  execution nearest to where he committed his last crime. That is, where the
  crossroad leads to Daphne. There is no doubt about that whatever. He was
  nearly four days dying, and the sentries stood guard over him until he ceased
  to breathe, a little after sunset yesterday evening. So they say, at all
  events. A little before midnight, in Daphne, near one of those booths where
  the caterers prepare hot meals, a man strode up to where some slaves were
  seated around a fire. He burned a piece of parchment. All nine slaves agree
  that he was about Maternus' height and build; that he strode like a man who
  had been hurt; that he had mud and grass stains on his knees, and covered his
  face with a toga. They also swear he said he was Maternus, and that he was
  gone before they could recover their wits. They say his voice was sepulchral.
  One of the slaves, who can read, declares that the words on the parchment he
  burned were "Maternus Latro," and that it was the identical parchment he had
  seen hanging from Maternus' neck on the cross. They tortured that slave at
  once, of course, to get the truth out of him, and on the rack he contradicted
  himself at least a dozen times, so they whipped him and let him go, because
  his owner said he was a valuable cook; but the fact remains that the story
  hasn't been disproved.</p>

  <p>"And there is absolutely no doubt whatever about this: The caravan from
  Asia came in just a little after dawn, having traveled the last stage by
  night, as usual, in order to arrive early and get the formalities over with.
  They came past the place of execution before sunrise. They had heard the news
  of the execution from the north-bound caravan that passed them in the
  mountains. They had all been afraid of Maternus because he had robbed so many
  wayfarers, so naturally they were interested to see his dead body. It was
  gone!"</p>

  <p>"What of it? Probably the women took it down for burial. Robbers always
  have a troupe of women. Maternus never had to steal one, so they say. They
  flocked to him like Bacchanalians."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Bacchanalian</i>&mdash;a drunken reveler; an
  adherent of the cult of the wine-god Bacchus, the Roman equivalent of the
  ancient Greek god Dionysos For information on the this god's cult, see the
  <i>Wikipedia</i> entry <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"No matter. Now listen to this: between the time when they learned of
  Maternus' execution and their passing the place of execution that is to say
  at the narrowest part of the pass, where it curves and begins to descend on
  this side of the mountain&mdash;they were attacked by robbers who made use
  of Maternus' war-cry. The robbers were beaten off, although they wounded two
  men of the guard and got away with half-a-dozen horses and a slave-girl."</p>

  <p>"That means nothing&mdash;Pardon me a moment while I see what my man has
  been doing. What is it, Stilchio? Are you mad? You have contracted to deliver
  fifty bales at yesterday's price? You want to ruin me? Oh. You are quite
  sure? Very well: A good man, that&mdash;went out and met the caravan
&mdash;bought low&mdash;sold high, and the price is falling. But as I was
  saying, your story is simply a string of coincidences. All the robbers use
  Maternus' war-cry, because of the terror his name inspires; they probably had
  not heard he had been crucified."</p>

  <p>"Well, that was what the caravan folk thought, until they passed the place
  of execution and saw no body there."</p>

  <p>"The robbers possibly themselves removed it and were seeking to avenge
  Maternus."</p>

  <p>"Much more likely somebody was bribed to let him escape! We all know
  Maternus was scourged, for that was done in Antioch; but they did not scourge
  him very badly, for fear he might die on the way to the place of execution.
  There is no doubt he was crucified, but he was only tied, not nailed. It
  would have been perfectly simple to substitute some other criminal that first
  night&mdash;somebody who looked a little like him; they would give the
  substitute poppy juice to keep him from crying out to passers-by."</p>

  <p>"Substitution has often been done, of course. But it takes a lot of money
  and considerable influence to bribe the guard. They are under the authority
  of a centurion,* who would have to look out for informers. And besides, you
  can't persuade me that a man who had been scourged, and crucified, if only
  for one day, could walk into Daphne two or three nights afterward and carry
  on a conversation. Why should he visit Daphne? Why should he choose that
  place, of all places in the world, and midnight, to destroy the
  identification parchment? Having destroyed it, why did he then tell the
  slaves who he was? It sounds like a tale out of Egypt to me."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>centurion</i> (Latin: "centurio")&mdash;a

  commanded a centuria (century) of between 60 and 160 men, depending on force

  ]</p>

  <p>"Well, the priests are saying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tchutt-tchutt! Priests say anything."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, the priests are saying that Maternus, after he was
  captured, managed to convey a message to his followers commanding them to
  offer sacrifices to Apollo, who accordingly intervened in his behalf. And
  they say he undoubtedly went to Daphne to return thanks at the temple
  threshold."</p>

  <p>"Hah-Hah! Excellent! Let us go to the baths. You need to sweat the
  superstition out of you! Better leave word where we are going, so that our
  factors will know where to find us in case any important business turns
  up."</p>

  <p>In the palace, in the office of the governor, where the lapping of water
  and irises could be heard through the opened windows, Pertinax sat facing the
  governor of Antioch across a table heaped with parchment rolls. A dozen
  secretaries labored in the next room, but the door between was closed; the
  only witnesses were leisurely, majestic swans, seen down a vista of well
  pruned shrubbery that flanked the narrow lawn. An awning crimsoned and
  subdued the sunlight, concealing the lines on the governor's face and
  suggesting color on his pale cheeks.</p>

  <p>He was a fat man, pouched under the eyes and growing bald&mdash;an
  almost total contrast to the lean and active, although older Pertinax. His
  smile was cynical. His mouth curved downward. He had large, fat hands and
  cold, dark calculating eyes.</p>

  <p>"I would feel more satisfied," he said, "if I could have Norbanus'
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"Find him then!" Pertinax answered irritably. "What is the matter with
  your police? In Rome, if I propose to find a man he is brought before me
  instantly."</p>

  <p>"This is not Rome," said the governor, "as you would very soon discover if
  you occupied my office. I sent a lictor and a dozen men to Norbanus' house,
  but he is missing and has not been seen, although it is known, and you admit,
  that he dined with you last night at Daphne. He has no property worth
  mentioning. His house is under lien to money-lenders. He is well known to
  have been Sextus' friend, and the moment this order arrived proscribing
  Sextus I added to it the name of Norbanus in my own handwriting, on the
  principle that treason keeps bad company.</p>

  <p>"My own well known allegiance to the emperor obliges me to tear out the
  very roots of treason at the first suggestion of its presence in our midst. I
  have long suspected Sextus, who was a cross-grained, obstinate, quick-witted,
  proud young man&mdash;a lot too critical. I am convinced now that he and
  Norbanus were hatching some kind of plot between them&mdash;possibly
  against the sacred person of our emperor&mdash;a frightful sacrilege!
&mdash;the suggestion of it makes me shudder! There is, of course, no doubt
  about Sextus; the emperor's own proscription brands him as a miscreant unfit
  to live, and he was lucky to have died by accident instead of being torn
  apart by tongs. It seems to me unquestionable that Norbanus shared his guilt
  and took care to escape before he could be seized and brought to justice.
  What is in doubt, most noble Pertinax, is how you can excuse yourself to our
  sacred emperor for having let Sextus escape from your clutches, after you had
  seen that letter! How can you excuse yourself for not pouncing the letter, to
  be used as evidence against rascally freedmen who forewarned the miscreant
  Sextus about the emperor's intentions?&mdash;and for not realizing that
  Norbanus was undoubtedly in league with him? How can you explain your having
  let Norbanus get away is something I confess I am unable to imagine."</p>

  <p>"Conjure your imagination!" Pertinax retorted. "I am to inquire into the
  suitability of Antioch or Daphne as the site of the Olympic games that the
  emperor proposed to preside over in person. You can imagine, I suppose, how
  profitable that would be for Antioch&mdash;and you. Am I to tell the
  emperor that robbers in the mountains and the laxity of local government make
  the selection of Antioch unwise?"</p>

  <p>They stared at each other silently across the table, Pertinax erect and
  definite, the governor of Antioch indefinite and stroking his chin with fat,
  white fingers.</p>

  <p>"It would be simplest," said the governor of Antioch at last, "to have
  Norbanus executed."</p>

  <p>"Some one should always be executed when the emperor signs proscription
  lists!" said Pertinax. "Has it ever occurred to you to wonder how many
  soldiers in the legions in the distant provinces were certified as dead
  before they left Rome?"</p>

  <p>The governor of Antioch smiled meanly. He resented the suggestions that
  there might be tricks he did not understand.</p>

  <p>"I have a prisoner," he said, "who might be Norbanus. He has been
  tortured. He refused to identify himself."</p>

  <p>"Does he look like him?"</p>

  <p>"That would be difficult to say. He broke into a jeweler's and was very
  badly beaten by the slaves, who slashed his face, which is heavily bandaged.
  He appears to be a Roman and is certainly a thief, but beyond that&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Much depends on who is interested in him," Pertinax suggested. "Usually a
  man's relatives&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the governor of Antioch's fat hand made a disparaging careless
  gesture. "He has no friends. He has been in the carceres* more than a month.
  I was reserving him for execution by the lions at the next public games.
  Truth to tell, I had almost forgotten him. I will write out a warrant for
  Norbanus' execution and it shall be attended to this morning. And by the way
&mdash;regarding the Olympic games&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>carceres</i> (Latin)&mdash;the cells in which
  prisoners were kept who had been sentenced to death. Under Roman law there
  was practically no imprisonment for crime. Fines, flogging, banishment were
  the substitutes for execution. Footnote by Mundy. For more information, see
  the article on <a href=

  website <i><a href="http://www.unrv.com/">UNVR History&mdash;Roman
  Empire</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"The emperor, I think, would like to see them held in Antioch," said
  Pertinax.</p>

  <p>The merchants strolling to the baths stood curiously for a while to watch
  one of the rapidly increasing sect of Christians, who leaned from a balcony
  over the street and exhorted a polyglot crowd of freedmen, slaves and idlers.
  He was bearded, brown-skinned from exposure, brown-robed, scrawny,
  vehement.</p>

  <p>"Peculiar times!" one merchant said. "If you and I should cause a crowd to
  gather while we prated about refusal to do homage to the gods&mdash;of whom
  mind you, the emperor is one, and not the least&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But let us listen," said the other.</p>

  <p>The man's voice was resonant. He used no tricks of oratory such as Romans
  over-valued, and was not too careful in the choice of phrases. The Greek
  idiom he used was unadorned&mdash;the language of the market-place and
  harbor-front. He made his points directly, earnestly, not arguing but like a
  guide to far-off countries giving information:</p>

  <p>"Slaves&mdash;freedmen&mdash;masters&mdash;all are equal before God,
  and on the last day all shall rise up from the dead&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A loiterer heckled him:</p>

  <p>"Hah! The crucified too?&mdash;what about Maternus?"</p>

  <p>The preacher, throwing up his right hand, snatched at opportunity:</p>

  <p>"There were two thieves crucified, one on either hand, as I have told you.
  To the one was said: 'This day shalt thou be with me in paradise'; but to the
  other nothing. Nevertheless, all shall rise up from the dead on the last day
&mdash;you, and your friends, and the wise and the fools, and the slave and
  the free&mdash;aye, and Maternus also&mdash;"</p>

  <p>One merchant grinned to the other:</p>

  <p>"Yet I think it was on the first night that Maternus rose up! They stiffen
  if they stay a whole night on the cross. If he could walk to Daphne three
  nights later, he had not been crucified many hours. Come, let us go to the
  baths before the crowd gets there. If one is late those insolent attendants
  lose one's clothing, and there is no chance whatever of getting a good soft-
  handed slave to rub one down. Don't you hate to be currycombed by a rascal
  with corns on his fingers?"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">CHAPTER 5.</a><br>
  Rome&mdash;The Thermae Of Titus</h2>

  <p class="first">There were even birds, to fill the air with music. All the
  known world, and the far-away mysterious lands of which Alexander's followers
  had started legends multiplying centuries ago, had contributed to Rome's
  adornment; plunder and trade goods drifted through in spite of distances. The
  city had become the vortex of the energy, virility and vice of east and west
&mdash;a glory of marble and gilded cornices, of domes and spires, of
  costumes, habits, faces, languages&mdash;of gorgeousness and squalor
&mdash;license, privilege and rigid formalism&mdash;extravagance&mdash;
  and of innumerable gods.</p>

  <p>There was nobility and love of virtue, cheek by jowl with beastliness, nor
  was it always easy to discover which was which; but the birds sang blithely
  in the cages in the portico, where the long seat was on which philosophers
  discoursed to anyone who cared to listen. The baths that the Emperor Titus
  built were the supreme, last touch of all. From furnaces below-ground, where
  the whipped slaves sweated in the dark, to domed roof where the doves changed
  hue amid the gleam of gold and colored glass, they typified Rome, as the city
  herself was of the essence of the world.</p>

  <p>The approach to the Thermae of Titus* was blocked by litters, some heavy
  enough to be borne by eight matched slaves and large enough for company.
  Women oftener than men shared litters with friends; then the troupe of
  attendants was doubled; slaves were in droves, flocks, hordes around the
  building, making a motley sight of it in their liveries, which were
  adaptations of the every-day costumes of almost all the countries of the
  known world.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Thermae of Titus</i>&mdash;a public bathhouse
  built near the Colosseum by Emperor Titus in 80 CE. For information on Roman
  baths, see the article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermae">"Thermae"</a> in <i>Wikipedia</i>.
  ]</p>

  <p>Under the entrance portico, between the double row of marble columns, sat
  a throng of fortune-tellers of both sexes, privileged because the aedile* of
  that year had superstitious leanings, but as likely as not to be driven away,
  and even whipped, when the next man should succeed to office. In and out
  among the crowd ran tipsters, touts for gambling dens and sellers of charms;
  most of them found ready customers among the slaves, who had nothing to do
  but wait, and stare, and yawn until their masters came out from the baths.
  They were raw, inexperienced slaves who had not a coin or two to spend.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>aedile</i> (Latin)&mdash;an elected official of
  ancient Rome who was responsible for public works and games and who
  supervised markets, the grain supply, and the water supply. <i><a href=

  Dictionary</a></i>. For more information, see the article <a href=

  ]</p>

  <p>Within the entrance of the Thermae was a marble court, where better known
  philosophers discoursed on topics of the day, each to his own group of
  admirers. A Christian, dressed like any other Roman, held one corner with a
  crowd around him. There was a tremendous undercurrent of reaction against the
  prevalent cynical materialism and the vortex of fashion was also the cauldron
  of new aspirations and the battle-ground of wits.</p>

  <p>Beyond the inner entrance were the two disrobing rooms&mdash;women to
  the left, men to the right where slaves, whose insolence had grown into a
  cultivated art, exchanged the folded garments for a bracelet with a number.
  Thence, stark-naked, through the bronze doors set in green-veined marble,
  bathers passed into the vast frigidarium,* whose marble plunge was surrounded
  by a mosaic promenade beneath a bronze and marble balcony.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>frigidarium</i> (Latin)&mdash;The cooling room of
  the Roman thermae, furnished with a cold bath. For more information see
  <a href="http://www.dl.ket.org/latin2/mores/baths/history/index.htm">The
  History of Ancient Roman Baths</a>. ]</p>

  <p>There men and women mingled indiscriminately, watching the divers,
  conversing, matching wits, exchanging gossip, some walking briskly around the
  promenade while others lounged on the marble seats that were interspaced
  against the wall between the statues.</p>

  <p>There was not one gesture of indecency. A man who had stared at a woman
  would have been thrown out, execrated and forever more refused admission. But
  out in the street, where the litter-bearers and attendants whiled away the
  time, there were tales told that spread to the ends of the earth.</p>

  <p>On a bench of black marble, between two statues of the Grecian Muses,
  Pertinax sat talking with Bultius Livius, subprefect* of the palace. They
  were both pink-skinned from plunging in the pool, and the white scars, won in
  frontier wars, showed all the more distinctly. Bultius Livius was a clean-
  shaven, sharp-looking man with a thin-lipped air of keenness.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>prefect</i> and <i>subprefect</i> (Latin:
  "praefectus" and "subpraefectus")&mdash;"praefectus" (from the verb
  "praeficere," to make in front, i.e. put in charge) was the formal title of
  many, fairly low to high-ranking, military and civil officials in the Roman
  Empire, whose powers were not embodied in their person (as it was with
  elected Magistrates) but conferred by delegation from a higher authority. The
  title often included a qualifier denoting the official's area of
  responsibility: e.g. "praefecti urbi" - city prefect in charge of the
  administration of Rome; "praefectus equitum" - a cavalry commander;
  "praefectus praetorio" - Praetorian Prefect, commander of the Praetorian
  Guard. <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praefectus">Wikipedia</a></i>
  (paraphrased). A "subpraefectus" was a junior or subordinate official or
  commmander.]</p>

  <p>"This dependence on Marcia can easily be overdone," he remarked. His eyes
  moved restlessly left and right. He lowered his voice. "Nobody knows how long
  her hold over Caesar will last. She owns him at present&mdash;owns him
  absolutely&mdash;owns Rome. He delights in letting her revoke his orders;
  it's a form of self-debauchery; he does things purposely to have her overrule
  him. But that has already lasted longer than I thought it would."</p>

  <p>"It will last as long as she and her Christians spy for him and make life
  pleasant," said Pertinax.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. But that is the difficulty," Livius answered, moving his eyes
  again restlessly. There was not much risk of informers in the Thermae, but a
  man never knew who his enemies were. "Marcia represents the Christians, and
  the idiots won't let well enough alone. By Hercules, they have it all their
  own way, thanks to Marcia. They are allowed to hold their meetings. All the
  statutes against them are ignored. They even go unpunished if they don't
  salute Caesar's image! They are allowed to preach against slavery. It has got
  so now that if a man condemned to death pretends he is a Christian they're
  even allowed to rescue him out of the carceres! That's Juno's truth: I know
  of a dozen instances. But it's the old story: Put a beggar on a horse and he
  will demand your house next. There's no satisfying them. I am told they
  propose to abolish the gladiatorial combats! Laugh if you like. I have it
  from unquestionable sources. They intend to begin by abolishing the execution
  of criminals in the arena. Shades of Nero! They keep after Marcia day and
  night to dissuade Caesar from taking part in the spectacles, on the theory
  that he helps to make them popular."</p>

  <p>"What do they propose to substitute in popular esteem?" asked
  Pertinax.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. They're mad enough for anything, and their hold over Marcia
  is beyond belief. The next thing you'll know, they'll persuade her it's
  against religion to be Caesar's mistress! They're quite capable of sawing off
  the branch they're sitting on. By Hercules, I hope they do it! Some of us
  might go down in the scramble, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does Marcia give Christian reasons to the emperor?" asked Pertinax, his
  forehead puzzled.</p>

  <p>"No, no. No, by Hercules. No, no. Marcia is as skillful at managing
  Commodus as he is at hurling a javelin or driving horses. She talks about the
  dignity of Caesar and the glory of Rome&mdash;uses truth adroitly for her
  own ends&mdash;argues that if he continues to keep company with gladiators
  and jockeys, and insists on taking part in the combats, Rome may begin to
  despise him."</p>

  <p>"Rome does!" murmured Pertinax, his eyes and lips suggesting a mere
  flicker of a smile. "But only let Commodus once wake up to the fact
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bultius Livius nodded.</p>

  <p>"He will return the compliment and show us how to despise at wholesale,
  eh? Marcia's life and yours and mine wouldn't be worth an hour's purchase.
  The problem is, who shall warn Marcia? She grows intolerant of friendly
  hints. I made her a present the other day of eight matched German
  litter-bearers&mdash;beauties&mdash;they cost a fortune&mdash;and I
  took the opportunity to have a chat with her. She told me to go home and try
  to manage my own wife! Friendly enough&mdash;she laughed&mdash;she meant
  no enmity; but shrewd though she is, and far-seeing though she is, the wine
  of influence is going to her head. You know what that portends. Few men, and
  fewer women, can drink deeply of that wine and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She comes," said Pertinax.</p>

  <p>There was a stir near the bronze door leading to the women's disrobing
  hall. Six women in a group were answering greetings, Marcia in their midst,
  but no man in the Thermae looked at them a moment longer than was necessary
  to return the wave of the hand with which Marcia greeted every one before
  walking down the steps into the plunge. She did not even wear the customary
  bracelet with its numbered metal disk; not even the attendants at the Thermae
  would presume to lose the clothing of the mistress of the emperor. Commodus,
  who at the age of twelve had flung a slave into the furnace because the water
  was too hot, would have made short work of anyone who mislaid Marcia's
  apparel.</p>

  <p>She did not belie her reputation. It was no wonder that the sculptors
  claimed that every new Venus they turned out was Marcia's portrait. Her
  beauty, as her toes touched water, was like that of Aphrodite rising from the
  wave. The light from the dome shone golden on her brown hair and her glossy
  skin. She was a thing of sensuous delight, incapable of coarseness, utterly
  untouched by the suggestion of vulgarity, and yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is strange she should take up with fancy religions," said Pertinax
  under his breath.</p>

  <p>She was pagan in every gesture, and not a patrician. That was indefinable
  but evident to trained eyes. Neither he, who knew her intimately, nor the
  newest, newly shaven son of a provincial for the first time exploring the
  wonders of Rome, could have imagined her as anything except a rich man's
  mistress.</p>

  <p>She plunged into the pool and swam like a mermaid, her companions
  following, climbed out at the farther end, where the diving-boards projected
  in tiers, one above the other, and passed through a bronze door into the
  first of the sweating-rooms, evidently conscious of the murmur of comment
  that followed her, but taking no overt notice of it.</p>

  <p>"Who is to be the next to try to reason with her&mdash;you?" asked
  Bultius Livius.</p>

  <p>"No, not I. I have shot my bolt," said Pertinax and closed his eyes, as if
  to shut out something from his memory&mdash;or possibly to banish thoughts
  he did not relish. There came a definite, hard glint into Livius's eyes; he
  had a name for being sharper to detect intrigue and its ramifications than
  even the sharp outline of his face would indicate.</p>

  <p>"You have heard of her latest indiscretion?" he asked, narrowly watching
  Pertinax. "There is a robber at large, named Maternus&mdash;you have heard
  of him? The man appears and disappears. Some say he is the same Maternus who
  was crucified near Antioch at about the time when you were there; some say he
  isn't. He is reported to visit Rome in various disguises, and to be able to
  conduct himself so well that he can pass for a patrician. Some say he has a
  large band; some say, hardly any followers. Some say it was he who robbed the
  emperor's own mail a month ago. He is reported to be here, there, everywhere;
  but there came at last reliable information that he lives in a cave in the
  woods on an estate that fell to the fiscus* at the time when Maximus and his
  son Sextus were proscribed."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>fiscus</i> (Latin)&mdash;the government
  department into which all payments were made, corresponding roughly to a
  modern treasury department. Footnote by Mundy. The following, more precise
  definition is given in <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscus">Wikipedia</a></i>: "The personal
  treasury of the emperors of Rome. The word is literally translated as
  'basket' or 'purse' and was used to describe those forms of revenue collected
  from the provinces (specifically the imperial provinces), which were then
  granted to the emperor. Its existence pointed to the division of power in the
  early era of the Empire between the imperial court and the Senate. In
  subsequent years, as the emperors assumed greater control over the finances
  of the Roman world, the size of the fiscus was increased." ]</p>

  <p>Pertinax looked bored. He yawned.</p>

  <p>"I think I will go in and sweat a while," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. Let me finish," said Livius. "It was reported to Caesar that the
  highwayman Maternus lives in a cave on this Aventine estate, and that the
  slaves and tenants on the place, who, of course, all passed to the new owner
  when the estate was sold, not only tolerate him but supply him with victuals
  and news. Caesar went into one of his usual frenzies, cursed half the
  senators by name, and ordered out a cohort* from a legion getting ready to
  embark at Ostia. He ordered them to lay waste the estate, burn all the woods
  and if necessary torture the slaves and tenants, until they had Maternus.
  Dead or alive, they were not to dare to come without him, and meanwhile the
  rest of the legion was kept waiting at Ostia, with all the usual nuisance of
  desertions and drunkenness and what not else."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>cohort</i> (Latin: "cohors)&mdash;a fairly large
  military unit, generally consisting of one type of soldier ... Originally,
  the cohort was a sub-unit of a Roman legion, consisting of 480 infantrymen.
  The cohort itself was divided into six centuries of 80 men commanded each by
  a centurion ... <i><a href=

  ]</p>

  <p>"Everybody knows about that," said Pertinax. "As governor of Rome it was
  my duty to point out to the emperor the inconvenience of keeping that legion
  waiting under arms so near the city. I was snubbed for my pains, but I did my
  duty."</p>

  <p>"Your duty? There were plenty of people more concerned than you," said
  Livius, looking again as if he thought he had detected an intrigue. "There
  were the Ostian authorities, for instance, but I did not hear of their
  complaining."</p>

  <p>"Naturally not," said Pertinax, suppressing irritation. "Every day the
  legion lingered there meant money for the enterprising city fathers. I am
  opposed to all the petty pouching of commissions that goes on."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless. Being governor of Rome, you naturally&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have heard of peculations at the palace," Pertinax interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Be that as it may, Commodus ordered out the cohort, sent it marching and
  amused himself inventing new ingenious torments for Maternus. Alternatively,
  he proposed to himself to have the cohort slaughtered in the arena, officers
  and all, if they should fail of their mission; so it was safe to wager they
  were going to bring back some one said to be Maternus, whether or not they
  caught the right man. Commodus was indulging in one of his storms of imperial
  righteousness. He was going to stamp out lawlessness. He was going to make it
  safe for anyone to come or go along the Roman roads. Oh, he was in a fine
  Augustan mood. It wasn't safe for anyone but Marcia to come within a mile of
  him. Scowl&mdash;you know that scowl of his&mdash;it freezes the very
  sentries on the wall if he looks at their backs through the window! I don't
  suppose there was a woman in Rome just then who would have cared to change
  places with Marcia! He sent for her, and half the palace betted she was ripe
  for banishment to one of those island retreats where Crispina* lived less
  than a week! But Marcia is fertile of surprises. She won't surprise me if she
  outlives Commodus&mdash;by Hercules, she won't surprise me if&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Crispina</i>&mdash;the wife of Commodus who was
  banished to the isle of Capreae (Capri) and there secretly put to death.

  <p>He stared at Pertinax with impudently keen eyes. Pertinax looked at the
  bronze door leading to the sweating-room, shrugging himself as if the
  frigidarium had grown too cool for comfort.</p>

  <p>"Marcia actually persuaded Commodus to countermand the order!" Livius
  said, emphasizing each word. "Almighty Jove can only guess what argument she
  used, but if Maternus had been one of her pet Christians she couldn't have
  saved him more successfully. Commodus sent a messenger post-haste that night
  to recall the cohort."</p>

  <p>"And a good thing too," Pertinax remarked. "It isn't a legion's business
  to supply cohorts to do the work of the district police. There were five
  thousand raw men on the verge of mutiny in Ostia&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;and," said Livius, "don't go yet
&mdash;this is interesting: Marcia, that same night, sent a messenger of her
  own to find Maternus and to warn him."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" Pertinax let a sign of nervousness escape him.</p>

  <p>"In the palace, those of us who value our lives and our fortunes make it a
  business to know what goes on," Livius answered with a dry laugh, "just as
  you take care to know what goes on in the city, Pertinax."</p>

  <p>The older man looked worried.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean it is common gossip in the palace?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"You are the first man I have spoken with. There are therefore only three
  who know, if you count the slave whom Marcia employed; four if you count
  Marcia. I had the great good luck not long ago to catch that slave in
  flagrante delicto*&mdash;never mind what he was doing; that is another
  story altogether&mdash;and he gave me an insight into a number of useful
  secrets. The point is, that particular slave takes care not to run errands
  nowadays without informing me. There is not much that Marcia does that I
  don't know about." Livius' eyes suggested gimlets boring holes into
  Pertinax's face. Not a change of the other's expression escaped him. Pertinax
  covered his mouth with his hand, pretending to yawn. He slapped his thighs to
  suggest that his involuntary shudder was due to having sat too long. But he
  did not deceive Livius. "It is known to me," said Livius, "that you and
  Marcia are in each other's confidence."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>in flagrante delicto</i> (Latin: "while the crime
  is blazing")&mdash;a legal term used to indicate that a criminal has been
  caught in the act of committing an offense ... The colloquial "caught red-
  handed" or "caught in the act" is an English equivalent... <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_flagrante_delicto">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"That makes me doubt your other information," Pertinax retorted. "No man
  can jump to such a ridiculous conclusion and call it knowledge without making
  me doubt him on all points. You bore me, Livius. I have important business
  waiting; I must make haste into the sweating-room and get that over
  with."</p>

  <p>But Livius' sharp, nervous laugh arrested him.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, friend Pertinax! Let Rome wait! Rome's affairs will outlive both
  of us. I suspect you intend to tell Marcia to have my name included in the
  next proscription list! But I am not quite such a simpleton as that. Sit down
  and listen. I have proof that you plotted with the governor of Antioch to
  have an unknown criminal executed in place of a certain Norbanus, who escaped
  with your connivance and has since become a follower of the highwayman
  Maternus. That involves you rather seriously, doesn't it! You see, I made
  sure of my facts before approaching you. And now&mdash;admit that I
  approached you tactfully! Come, Pertinax, I made no threats until you let me
  see I was in danger. I admire you. I regard you as a brave and an honorable
  Roman. I propose that you and I shall understand each other. You must take me
  into confidence, or I must take steps to protect myself."</p>

  <p>There was a long pause while a group of men and women came and chattered
  near by, laughing while one of the men tried to win a wager by climbing a
  marble pillar. Pertinax frowned. Livius did his best to look dependable and
  friendly, but his eyes were not those of a boon companion.</p>

  <p>"You are incapable of loyalty to anyone except yourself," said Pertinax at
  last. "What pledge do you propose to offer me?"</p>

  <p>"A white bull to Jupiter Capitolinus! I am willing to go with you to the
  temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and to swear on the altar whatever solemn oath
  you wish."</p>

  <p>Pertinax smiled cynically.</p>

  <p>"The men who slew Julius Caesar were under oath to him," he remarked.
  "Most solemn oaths they swore, then turned on one another like a pack of
  wolves! Octavian and Anthony were under oath; and how long did that last? My
  first claim to renown was based on having rewon the allegiance of our troops
  in Britain, who had broken the most solemn oath a man can take&mdash;of
  loyalty to Rome. An oath binds nobody. It simply is an emphasis of what a man
  intends that minute. It expresses an emotion. I believe the gods smile when
  they hear men pledge themselves. I personally, who am far less than a god and
  far less capable of reading men's minds, never trust a man unless I like him,
  or unless he gives me pledges that make doubt impossible."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't like me?" asked Livius.</p>

  <p>"I would like you better if I knew that I could trust you."</p>

  <p>"You shall, Pertinax! Bring witnesses! I will commit myself before your
  witnesses to do my part in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His restless eyes glanced right and left. Then he lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;in bringing about the political change you contemplate."</p>

  <p>"Let us go to the sweating-room," Pertinax answered. "Keep near me. I will
  think this matter over. If I see you holding speech not audible to me, with
  anyone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am already pledged. You may depend on me," said Livius. "I trust you
  more because you use caution. Come."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">CHAPTER 6.</a><br>
  The Emperor Commodus</h2>

  <p class="first">The imperial palace was a maze of splendor such as Babylon
  had never seen. It had its own great aqueducts to carry water for its
  fountains, for the gardens and for the imperial baths that were as
  magnificent, if not so large, as the Thermae of Titus. Palace after palace
  had been wrecked, remodeled and included in the whole, under the succeeding
  emperors, until the imperial quarters on the Palatine had grown into a city
  within a city.</p>

  <p>There were barracks for the Praetorian Guard that lacked not much of being
  a fortress. Rooms and stairways for the countless slaves were like honeycomb
  cells in the dark foundations. There were underground passages, some of them
  secret, some notorious, connecting wing with wing; and there was one, for the
  emperor's private use, that led to the great arena where the games were held,
  so that he might come and go with less risk of assassination.</p>

  <p>Even temples had been taken over and included within the surrounding wall
  to make room for the ever-multiplying suites of state apartments, as each
  Caesar strove to outdo the magnificence of his predecessor. Oriental marble,
  gold-leaf, exotic trees, silk awnings, fountains, the majestic figures of the
  guards, the bronze doors and the huge height of the buildings, awed even the
  Romans who were used to them.</p>

  <p>The throne-room was a place of such magnificence that it was said that
  even Caesar himself felt small in it. The foreign kings, ambassadors and
  Roman citizens admitted there to audience were disciplined without the
  slightest difficulty; there was no unseemliness, no haste, no crowding;
  horribly uncomfortable in the heavy togas that court etiquette prescribed,
  reminded of their dignity by colossal statues of the noblest Romans of
  antiquity, and ushered by magnificently uniformed past masters of the art of
  ceremony, all who entered felt that they were insignificant intruders into a
  golden mystery. The palace prefect in his cloak of cloth of gold, with his
  ivory wand of office, seemed a high priest of eternity; subprefects, standing
  in the marble antechamber to examine visitors' credentials and see that none
  passed in improperly attired, were keepers of Olympus.</p>

  <p>The gilded marble throne was on a dais approached by marble steps, beneath
  a balcony to which a stair ascended from behind a carved screen. Trumpets
  announced the approach of Caesar, who could enter unobserved through a door
  at the side of the dais. From the moment that the trumpet sounded, and the
  guards grew as rigid as the basalt statues in the niches of the columned
  walls, it was a punishable crime to speak or even to move until Caesar
  appeared and was seated.</p>

  <p>Nor was Caesar himself an anticlimax. Even Nero, nerveless in his latter
  days, when self-will and debauchery had pouched his eyes and stomach, had
  possessed the Roman gift of standing like a god. Vespasian and Titus, each in
  turn, was Mars personified. Aurelius had typified a gentler phase of Rome, a
  subtler dignity, but even he, whose worst severity was tempered by the
  philosophical regret that he could not kill crime with kindliness, had worn
  the imperial purple like Olympus' delegate.</p>

  <p>Commodus, in the minutes that he spared from his amusements to accept the
  glamour of the throne, was perfect. Handsomest of all the Caesars, he could
  act his part with such consummate majesty that men who knew him intimately
  half-believed he was a hero after all. Athletic, muscular and systematically
  trained, his vigor, that was purely physical, passed readily for spiritual
  quality within that golden hall, where the resources of the world were all
  put under tribute to provide a royal setting. He emerged. He smiled, as if
  the sun shone. He observed the rolled petitions, greetings, testimonials of
  flattery from private citizens and addresses of adulation from distant
  cities, being heaped into a gilded basket as the silent throng filed by
  beneath him. He nodded. Now and then he scowled, his irritation growing as
  the minutes passed. At each gesture of impatience the subprefects quietly
  impelled the crowd to quicker movement. But at the end of fifteen minutes
  Commodus grew tired of dignity and his ferocious scowl clouded his face like
  a thunderstorm.</p>

  <p>"Am I to sit here while the whole world makes itself ridiculous by staring
  at me?" he demanded, in a harsh voice. It was loud enough to fill the
  throne-room, but none knew whether it was meant for an aside or not and none
  dared answer him. The crowd continued flowing by, each raising his right hand
  and bowing as he reached the square of carpet that was placed exactly in
  front of Caesar's throne.</p>

  <p>Commodus rose to his feet. All movement ceased then and there was utter
  silence. For a moment he stood scowling at the crowd, one hand resting on the
  golden lion's head that flanked the throne. Then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Too many petitions!" he sneered, pointing at the overflowing basket; and
  in another moment he had vanished through the door behind the marble screen.
  Met and escorted up the stairs by groups of cringing slaves, he reached a
  columned corridor. Rich carpets lay on the mosaic floor; sunlight, from
  under; the awnings of a balcony glorious with potted flowers, shone on the
  colored statuary and the Grecian paintings.</p>

  <p>"What are all these women doing?" he demanded. There were girls, half-
  hidden behind the statues, each one trying, as he passed her, to divine his
  mood and to pose attractively.</p>

  <p>"Where is Marcia? What will she do to me next? Is this some new scheme of
  hers to keep me from enjoying my manhood? Send them away! The next girl I
  catch in the corridor shall be well whipped. Where is Marcia?"</p>

  <p>Throwing away his toga for a slave to catch and fold he turned between
  gilded columns, through a bronze door, into the antechamber of the royal
  suite. There a dozen gladiators greeted him as if he were the sun shining out
  of the clouds after a month of rainy weather.</p>

  <p>"This is better!" he exclaimed. "Ho, there, Narcissus! Ho, there,
  Horatius! Ha! So you recover, Albinus? What a skull the man has! Not many
  could take what I gave him and be on their feet again within the week! You
  may follow me, Narcissus. But where is Marcia?"</p>

  <p>Marcia called to him through the curtained door that led to the next room
 &mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am waiting, Commodus."</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter, when she calls me Commodus it means an argument! Are some
  more of her Christians in the carceres, I wonder? Or has some new
  highwayman&mdash;By Juno's breasts, I tremble when she calls me
  Commodus!"</p>

  <p>The gladiators laughed. He made a pass at one of them, tripped him,
  scuffled a moment and raised him struggling in the air, then flung him into
  the nearest group, who broke his fall and set him on his feet again.</p>

  <p>"Am I strong enough to face my Marcia?" he asked and, laughing, passed
  into the other room, where half a dozen women grouped themselves around the
  imperial mistress.</p>

  <p>"What now?" he demanded. "Why am I called Commodus?"</p>

  <p>He stood magnificent, with folded arms, confronting her, play-acting the
  part of a guiltless man arraigned before the magistrate.</p>

  <p>"O Roman Hercules," she said, "I spoke in haste, you came so much sooner
  than expected. What woman can remember you are anything but Caesar when you
  smile at her? I am in love, and being loved, I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Contriving some new net for me, I'll wager! Come and watch the new men
  training with the caestus;* I will listen to your plan for ruling me and Rome
  while the sight of a good set-to stirs my genius to resist your
  blandishments!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>caestus, cestus</i> (Latin, from "caedere" - to
  strike, to punch)&mdash;a covering for the hand made of leather straps
  weighted with iron or lead and worn by boxers in ancient Rome. <i><a href=

  <p>"Caesar," she said, "speak first with me alone." Instantly his manner
  changed. He made a gesture of impatience. His sudden scowl frightened the
  women standing behind Marcia, although she appeared not to notice it, with
  the same peculiar trick of seeming not to see what she did not wish to seem
  to see that she had used when she walked naked through the Thermae.</p>

  <p>"Send your scared women away then," he retorted. "I trust Narcissus. You
  may speak before him."</p>

  <p>Her women vanished, hurrying into another room, the last one drawing a
  cord that closed a jingling curtain.</p>

  <p>"Do you not trust me?" asked Marcia. "And is it seemly, Commodus, that I
  should speak to you before a gladiator?"</p>

  <p>"Speak or be silent!" he grumbled, giving her a black look, but she did
  not seem to notice it. Her genius&mdash;the secret of her power&mdash;was
  to seem forever imperturbable and loving.</p>

  <p>"Let Narcissus bear witness then; since Caesar bids me, I obey! Again and
  again I have warned you, Caesar. If I were less your slave and more your
  sycophant I would have tired of warning you. But none shall say of Marcia
  that her Caesar met Nero's fate, whose women ran away and left him. Not while
  Marcia lives shall Commodus declare he has no friends."</p>

  <p>"Who now?" he demanded angrily. "Get me my tablet! Come now, name me your
  conspirators and they shall die before the sun sets!"</p>

  <p>When he scowled his beauty vanished, his eyes seeming to grow closer like
  an ape's. The mania for murder that obsessed him tautened his sinews. Cheeks,
  neck, forearms swelled with knotted strength. Ungovernable passion shook
  him.</p>

  <p>"Name them!" he repeated, beckoning unconsciously for the tablet that none
  dared thrust into his hand.</p>

  <p>"Shall I name all Rome?" asked Marcia, stepping closer, pressing herself
  against him. "O Hercules, my Roman Hercules&mdash;does love, that makes us
  women see, put bandages on men's eyes? You have turned your back upon the
  better part of Rome to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Better part?" He shook her by the shoulders, snorting. "Liars, cowards,
  ingrates, strutting peacocks, bladders of wind boring me and one another with
  their empty phrases, cringing lickspittles&mdash;they make me sick to look
  at them! They fawn on me like hungry dogs. By Jupiter, I make myself
  ridiculous too often, pandering to a lot of courtiers! If they despise me
  then as I despise myself, I am in a bad way! I must make haste and live
  again! I will get the stench of them out of my nostrils and the sickening
  sight of them out of my eyes by watching true men fight! When I slay lions
  with a javelin, or gladiators&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You but pander to the rabble," Marcia interrupted. "So did Nero. Did they
  come to his aid when the Senate and his friends deserted him?"</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt me, woman! Senate! Court!" he snorted. "I can rout the
  Senate with a gesture! I will fill my court with gladiators! I can change my
  ministers as often as I please&mdash;aye, and my mistress too," he added,
  glaring at her. "Out with the names of these new conspirators who have set
  you trembling for my destiny!"</p>

  <p>"I know none&mdash;not yet," she said. "I can feel, though. I hear the
  whispers in the Thermae&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter, then I will close the Thermae."</p>

  <p>"When I pass through the streets I read men's faces&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Snarled, have they? My Praetorian Guard shall show them what it is to be
  bitten! Mobs are no new things in Rome. The old way is the proper way to deal
  with mobs! Blood, corn and circuses, but principally blood! By the Dioscuri,*
  I grow weary of your warnings, Marcia!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Dioscuri</i> (Latin from the Greek "dioskouroi",
  boys of Zeus)&mdash;Castor and Pollux, the twin sons of Leda and brothers
  of Helen and Clytemnestra, who were transformed by Zeus into the
  constellation Gemini. <i><a href=

  <p>He thrust her away from him and went growling like a bear into his own
  apartment, where his voice could be heard cursing the attendants whose
  dangerous duty it was to divine in an instant what clothes he would wear and
  to help him into them. He came out naked through the door, saw Marcia talking
  to Narcissus, laughed and disappeared again. Marcia raised her voice:</p>

  <p>"Telamonion! Oh, Telamonion!"</p>

  <p>A curly-headed Greek boy hardly eight years old came running from the
  outer corridor&mdash;all laughter&mdash;one of those spoiled favorites of
  fortune whom it was the fashion to keep as pets. Their usefulness consisted
  mainly in retention of their innocence.</p>

  <p>"Telamonion, go in and play with him. Go in and make him laugh. He is bad
  tempered."</p>

  <p>Confident of everybody's good-will, the child vanished through the
  curtains where Commodus roared him a greeting. Marcia continued talking to
  Narcissus in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"When did you see Sextus last?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"But yesterday."</p>

  <p>"And what has he done, do you say? Tell me that again."</p>

  <p>"He has found out the chiefs of the party of Lucius Septimius Severus. He
  has also discovered the leaders of Pescennius Niger's party. He says, too,
  there is a smaller group that looks toward Clodius Albinus, who commands the
  troops in Britain."</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you names?"</p>

  <p>"No. He said he knew I would tell you, and you might tell Commodus, who
  would write all the names on his proscription list. Sextus, I tell you,
  reckons his own life nothing, but he is extremely careful for his
  friends."</p>

  <p>"It would be easy to set a trap and catch him. He is insolent. He has had
  too much rein," said Marcia. "But what would be the use?" Narcissus answered.
  "There would be Norbanus, too, to reckon with. Each plays into the other's
  hands. Each knows the other's secrets. Kill one, and there remains the other
&mdash;doubly dangerous because alarmed. They take turns to visit Rome, the
  other remaining in hiding with their following of freedmen and educated
  slaves. They only commit just enough robbery to gain themselves an enviable
  reputation in the countryside. They visit their friends in Rome in various
  disguises, and they travel all over Italy to plot with the adherents of this
  faction or the other. Sextus favors Pertinax&mdash;says he would make a
  respectable emperor&mdash;another Marcus Aurelius. But Pertinax knows next
  to nothing of Sextus' doings, although he protects Sextus as far as he can
  and sees him now and then. Sextus' plan is to keep all three rival factions
  by the ears, so that if anything should happen&mdash;" he nodded toward the
  curtain, from behind which came the sounds of childish laughter and the
  crashing voice of Commodus encouraging in some piece of mischief&mdash;
  "they would be all at odds and Pertinax could seize the throne."</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether I was mad that I protected Sextus!" exclaimed Marcia.
  "He has served us well. If I had let them catch and crucify him as Maternus,
  we would have had no one to keep us informed of all these cross-conspiracies.
  But are you sure he favors Pertinax?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure. He even risked an interview with Flavia Titiana, to implore
  her influence with her husband. Sextus would be all for striking now, this
  instant; he has assured himself that the world is tired of Commodus, and that
  no faction is strong enough to stand in the way of Pertinax; but he knows how
  difficult it will be to persuade Pertinax to assert himself. Pertinax will
  not hear of murdering Caesar; he says: 'Let us see what happens&mdash;if
  the Fates intend me to be Caesar, let the Fates show how!'"</p>

  <p>"Aye, that is Pertinax!" said Marcia. "Why is it that the honest men are
  all such delayers! As for me, I will save my Commodus if he will let me. If
  not, the Praetorian Guard shall put Pertinax on the throne before any other
  faction has a chance to move. Otherwise we all die&mdash;all of us! Severus
&mdash;Pescennius Niger&mdash;Clodius Albinus&mdash;any of the others
  would include us in a general proscription. Pertinax is friendly. He protects
  his friends. He is the safest man in all ways. Let Pertinax be acclaimed by
  all the Praetorian Guard and the Senate would accept him eagerly enough. They
  would feel sure of his mildness. Pertinax would do no wholesale murdering to
  wipe out opposition; he would try to pacify opponents by the institution of
  reforms and decent government."</p>

  <p>"You must beware you are not forestalled," Narcissus warned her. "Sextus
  tells me there is more than one man ready to slay Commodus at the first
  chance. Severus, Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus keep themselves
  informed as to what is going on; their messengers are in constant movement.
  If Commodus should lift a hand against any of those three, that would be the
  signal for civil war. All three would march on Rome."</p>

  <p>"Caesar is much more likely to learn of the plotting through his own
  informers, and to try to terrify the generals by killing their supporters
  here in Rome," said Marcia. "What does Sextus intend? To kill Caesar
  himself?"</p>

  <p>Narcissus nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, when Sextus thinks that time has come, you kill him! Let that be
  your task. We must save the life of Commodus as long as possible. When
  nothing further can be done, we must involve Pertinax so that he won't dare
  to back out. It was he, you know, who persuaded me to save Maternus the
  highwayman's life; it was he who told me Maternus is really Sextus, son of
  Maximus. His knowledge of that secret gives me a certain hold on Pertinax!
  Caesar would have his head off at a word from me. But the best way with
  Pertinax is to stroke the honest side of him&mdash;the charcoal-burner side
  of him&mdash;the peasant side, if that can be done without making him too
  diffident. He is perfectly capable of offering the throne to some one else at
  the last minute!"</p>

  <p>A step sounded on the other side of the curtain. "Caesar!" Narcissus
  whispered. As excuse for being seen in conversation with her he began to show
  her a charm against all kinds of treachery that he had bought from an
  Egyptian. She snatched it from him.</p>

  <p>"Caesar!" she exclaimed, bounding toward Commodus and standing in his way.
  Not even she dared lay a hand on him when he was in that volcanic mood. "As
  you love me, will you wear this?"</p>

  <p>"For love of you, what have I not done?" he retorted, smiling at her.
  "What now?"</p>

  <p>She advanced another half-step, but no nearer. There was laughter on his
  lips, but in his eye cold cruelty.</p>

  <p>"My Caesar, wear it! It protects against conspiracy."</p>

  <p>He showed her a new sword that he had girded on along with the short tunic
  of a gladiator.</p>

  <p>"Against the bellyache, use Galen's pills; but this is the right medicine
  against conspiracy!" he answered. Then he took the little golden charm into
  his left hand, tossing it on his palm and looked at her, still smiling.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get this bauble?"</p>

  <p>"Not I. One of those magicians who frequent that Forum sold it to
  Narcissus."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" He flung it through the window. "Who is the magician? Name him! I
  will have him thrown into the carceres. We'll see whether the charms he sells
  so cheap are any good! Or is he a Christian?" he asked, sneering.</p>

  <p>"The Christians, you know, don't approve of charms," Marcia answered.</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter, there's not much that they do approve of!" he retorted. "I
  begin to weary of your Christians. I begin to think Nero was right, and my
  father, too! There was a wisdom in treating Christians as vermin! It might
  not be a bad thing, Marcia, to warn your Christians to procure themselves a
  charm or two against my weariness of their perpetual efforts to govern me!
  The Christians, I suppose, have been telling you to keep me out of the arena?
  Hence this living statuary in the corridor, and all this talk about the
  dignity of Rome! Tscharr-rrh! There's more dignity about one gladiator's
  death than in all Rome outside the arena! Woman, you forget you are only a
  woman. I remember that! I am a god! I have the blood of Caesar in my veins.
  And like the unseen gods, I take my pleasure watching men and women die! I
  loose my javelins like thunderbolts&mdash;like Jupiter himself! Like
  Hercules&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. He noticed Marcia was laughing. Only she, in all the Roman
  empire, dared to mock him when he boasted. Not even she knew why he let her
  do it. He began to smile again, the frightful frown that rode over his eyes
  dispersing, leaving his forehead as smooth as marble.</p>

  <p>"If I should marry you and make you empress," he said, "how long do you
  think I should last after that? You are clever enough to rule the fools who
  squawk and jabber in the Senate and the Forum. You are beautiful enough to
  start another siege of Troy! But remember: You are Caesar's concubine, not
  empress! Just remember that, will you! When I find a woman lovelier than you,
  and wiser, I will give you and your Christians a taste of Nero's policy. Now
&mdash;do you love me?"</p>

  <p>"If I did not, could I stand before you and receive these insults?" she
  retorted, trusting to the inspiration of the moment; for she had no method
  with him.</p>

  <p>"I would willingly die," she said, "if you would give the love you have
  bestowed on me to Rome instead, and use your godlike energy in ruling wisely,
  rather than in killing men and winning chariot races. One Marcia does not
  matter much. One Commodus can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Can love his Marcia!" he interrupted, with a high-pitched laugh. He
  seized her, nearly crushing out her breath. "A Caius and a Caia* we have
  been! By Jupiter, if not for you and Paulus I would have left Rome long ago
  to march in Alexander's wake! I would have carved me a new empire that did
  not stink so of politicians!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Caius and Caia</i> (Latin)&mdash;man and wife, an
  inseparable couple. An allusion to the phrase "Ubi tu Caius, ego Caia"
  (wherever thou art, Caius, there I, Caia, am also) spoken by the bride during
  the ancient Roman wedding ceremony. The phrase corresponds to the "I do" and
  "love, honor and obey" of our customary marriage formulas. As Caius and Caia
  were far and away the most frequent names among the Romans the phrase might
  be rendered: "Where you are Jack, I'm Jill." paraphrased from <i><a href=

  <p>He strode into the anteroom where all the gladiators waited and Narcissus
  had to follow him&mdash;well named enough, for he was lithe and muscular
  and beautiful, but, nonetheless, though taller, not to be compared with
  Commodus&mdash;even as the women, chosen for their good looks and
  intelligence, who hastened to reappear the moment the emperor's back was
  turned, were nothing like so beautiful as Marcia.</p>

  <p>In all the known world there were no two finer specimens of human
  shapeliness than the tyrant who ruled and the woman whose wits and daring had
  so long preserved him from his enemies.</p>

  <p>"Come to the arena," he called back to her. "Come and see how Hercules
  throws javelins from a chariot at full pelt!"</p>

  <p>But Marcia did not answer, and he forgot her almost before he reached the
  entrance of the private tunnel through which he passed to the arena. She had
  more accurately aimed and nicely balanced work to do than even Commodus could
  do with javelins against a living target.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">CHAPTER 7.</a><br>
  Marcia</h2>

  <p class="first">In everything but title and security of tenure Marcia was
  empress of the world, and she had what empresses most often lack&mdash;the
  common touch. She had been born in slavery. She had ascended step by step to
  fortune, by her own wits, learning by experience. Each layer of society was
  known to her&mdash;its virtues, prejudices, limitations and peculiar tricks
  of thought. Being almost incredibly beautiful, she had learned very early in
  life that the desired (not always the desirable) is powerful to sway men; the
  possessed begins to lose its sway; the habit of possession easily succumbs to
  boredom, and then power ceases. Even Commodus, accordingly, had never owned
  her in the sense that men own slaves; she had reserved to herself
  self-mastery, which called for cunning, courage and a certain ruthlessness,
  albeit tempered by a reckless generosity.</p>

  <p>She saw life skeptically, undeceived by the fawning flattery that Rome
  served up to her, enjoying it as a cat likes being stroked. They said of her
  that she slept with one eye open.</p>

  <p>Livius had complained in the Thermae to Pertinax that the wine of
  influence was going to Marcia's head, but he merely expressed the opinion of
  one man, who would have liked to feel himself superior to her and to use her
  for his own ends. She was not deceived by Livius, or by anybody else. She
  knew that Livius was keeping watch on her, and how he did it, having shrewdly
  guessed that a present of eight matched litter-bearers was too extravagant
  not to mask ulterior designs. She watched him much more artfully than he
  watched her. Her secret knowledge that he knew her secret was more dangerous
  to him than anything that he had found out could be dangerous to her.</p>

  <p>The eight matched litter-bearers waited with the gilded litter near a
  flight of marble steps that descended from the door of Marcia's apartments in
  the palace to a sunlit garden with a fountain in the midst. There was a crowd
  of servants and four Syrian eunuchs, sleek offensive menials in yellow robes;
  two lictors besides, with fasces* and the Roman civic uniform&mdash;a
  scandalous abuse of ancient ceremony&mdash;ready to conduct a progress
  through the city. But they all yawned. Marcia and her usual companion did not
  come; there was delay&mdash;and gossip, naturally.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>fasces</i> (Latin, plural of "fascis", bundle)
&mdash;a bundle of rods bound together around an ax with the blade
  projecting, carried before ancient Roman magistrates as an emblem of
  authority. <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/41/F0044100.html">The

  ]</p>

  <p>A yawning eunuch rearranged the bowknot of his girdle.</p>

  <p>"What does she want with Livius? He usually gets sent for when somebody
  needs punishing. Who do you suppose has fallen foul of her?"</p>

  <p>"Himself! He sent her messenger back with word he was engaged on palace
  business. I heard her tell the slave to go again and not return without him!
  Bacchus! But it wouldn't worry me if Livius should lose his head! For an
  aristocrat he has more than his share of undignified curiosity&mdash;
  forever poking his sharp nose into other people's business. Marcia may have
  found him out. Let's hope!"</p>

  <p>At the foot of the marble stairway, in the hall below Marcia's apartment,
  Livius stood remonstrating, growing nervous. Marcia, dressed in the dignified
  robes of a Roman matron, that concealed even her ankles and suggested the
  demure, self-conscious rectitude of olden times, kept touching his breast
  with her ivory fan, he flinching from the touch, subduing irritation.</p>

  <p>"If the question is, what I want with you, Livius, the answer is, that I
  invite you. Order your litter brought."</p>

  <p>"But Marcia, I am subprefect. I am responsible to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you hear?"</p>

  <p>"But if you will tell where we are going, I might feel justified in
  neglecting the palace business. I assure you I have important work to
  do."</p>

  <p>"There are plenty who can attend to it," said Marcia. "The most important
  thing in your life, Livius, is my good-will. You are delaying me."</p>

  <p>Livius glared at Caia Poppeia, the lady-in-waiting, who was smiling,
  standing a little behind Marcia. He hoped she would take the hint and
  withdraw out of earshot, but she had had instructions, and came half a step
  closer.</p>

  <p>"Will you let me go back to my office and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No!" answered Marcia.</p>

  <p>He yielded with a nervous gesture, that implored her not to make an
  indiscretion. A subprefect, in the nature of his calling, had too many
  enemies to relish repetition in the palace precincts of a threat from Marcia,
  however baseless it might be. And besides, it might be something serious that
  almost had escaped her lips. Untrue or true, it would be known all over the
  palace in an hour; within the day all Rome would know of it. There were two
  slaves by the front door, two more on the last step of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"I will come, of course," he said. "I am delighted. I am honored. I am
  fortunate!"</p>

  <p>She nodded. She sent one of her own slaves to order his private litter
  brought, while Livius attempted to look comfortable, cudgeling his brains to
  know what mischief she had found out. It was nothing unusual that his litter
  should follow hers through the streets of Rome; in fact, it was an honor
  coveted by all officials of the palace, that fell to his share rather
  frequently because of his distinguished air of a latter-day man of the world
  and his intimate knowledge of everybody's business and ancestry. He was often
  ordered to go with her at a moment's notice. But this was the first time she
  had refused to say where they were going, or why, and there was a hint of
  malice in her smile that made his blood run cold. He was a connoisseur of
  malice.</p>

  <p>Marcia leaned on his arm as she went down the steps to her litter. She
  permitted him to help her in. But then, while her companion was following
  through the silken curtains, she leaned out at the farther side and whispered
  to the nearest eunuch. Livius, climbing into his own gilt vehicle and lifted
  shoulder-high by eight Numidians, became aware that Marcia's eunuchs had been
  told to keep an eye on him; two yellow-robed, insufferably impudent
  inquisitors strode in among his own attendants.</p>

  <p>An escort of twenty Praetorian Guards and a decurion was waiting at the
  gate to take its place between the lictors and Marcia's litter, but that did
  not in any way increase Livius' sense of security. The Praetorian Guard
  regarded Marcia as the source of its illegal privileges. It looked to her far
  more than to the emperor for favors, buying them with lawless loyalty to her.
  She ruined discipline by her support of every plea for increased perquisites.
  No outraged citizen had any hope of redress so long as Marcia's ear could be
  reached (although Commodus got the blame for it). It was the key to Marcia's
  system of insurance against unforeseen contingencies. The only regularly
  drilled and armed troops in the city were as loyal to her, secretly and
  openly, as Livius himself was to the principle of cynical self-help.</p>

  <p>He began to feel thoroughly frightened, as he told himself that the escort
  and their decurion would swear to any statement Marcia might make. If she had
  learned that he was in the habit of receiving secret information from her
  slave, there were a thousand ways she might take to avenge herself; a very
  simple way would be to charge him with improper overtures and have him killed
  by the Praetorians&mdash;a way that might particularly interest her, since
  it would presumably increase her reputation for constancy to Commodus.</p>

  <p>The eunuchs watched him. The lictors and Praetorians cleared the way, so
  there were no convenient halts that could enable him to slip unnoticed
  through the crowd. His own attendants seemed to have divined that there was
  something ominous about the journey, and he was not the kind of man whose
  servants are devotedly attached to him. He knew it. He noticed sullenness
  already in the answers his servant gave him through the litter curtains, when
  he asked whether the man knew their destination.</p>

  <p>"None knows. All I know is, we must follow Marcia."</p>

  <p>The slave's voice was almost patronizing. Livius made up his mind, if he
  should live the day out, to sell the rascal to some farmer who would teach
  him with a whip what service meant. But he said nothing. He preferred to
  spring surprises, only hoping he himself might not be overwhelmed in one.</p>

  <p>By the time they reached Cornificia's house he was in such a state of
  nervousness, and so blanched, that he had to summon his servant into the
  litter to rub cosmetic on his cheeks. He took one of Galen's famous
  strychnine pills before he could prevent his limbs from trembling. Even so,
  when he rolled out of the litter and advanced with his courtliest bow to
  escort Marcia into the house, she recognized his fear and mocked him:</p>

  <p>"You are bilious? Or has some handsomer Adonis won your Venus from you? Is
  it jealousy?"</p>

  <p>He pretended that the litter-bearers needed whipping for having shaken
  him. It made him more than ever ill at ease that she should mock him before
  all the slaves who grouped themselves in Cornificia's forecourt. Hers was one
  of those houses set back from the street, combining an air of seclusion with
  such elegance as could not possibly escape the notice of the passer-by. The
  forecourt was adorned with statuary and the gate left wide, affording a
  glimpse of sunlit greenery and marble that entirely changed the aspect of the
  narrow street. There were never less than twenty tradesmen at the gate,
  imploring opportunity to show their wares, which were in baskets and boxes,
  with slaves squatting beside them. All Rome would know within the hour that
  Marcia had called on Cornificia, and that Livius, the subprefect, had been
  mocked by Marcia in public.</p>

  <p>A small crowd gathered to watch the picturesque ceremony of reception
&mdash;Cornificia's house steward marshaling his staff, the brightly colored
  costumes blending in the sunlight with the hues of flowers and the rich, soft
  sheen of marble in the shadow of tall cypresses. The Praetorians had to form
  a cordon in front of the gate, and the street became choked by the impeded
  traffic. Rome loved pageantry; it filled its eyes before its belly, which was
  nine-tenths of the secret of the Caesar's power.</p>

  <p>Within the house, however, there was almost a stoical calm&mdash;a
  sensation of cloistered chastity produced by the restraint of ornament and
  the subdued light on gloriously painted frescoes representing evening
  benediction at a temple altar, a gathering of the Muses, sacrifice before a
  shrine of Aesculapius* and Jason's voyage to Colchis for the Golden
  Fleece.&dagger; The inner court, where Cornificia received her guests, was
  like a sanctuary dedicated to the decencies, its one extravagance the almost
  ostentatious restfulness, accentuated by the cooing of white pigeons and the
  drip and splash of water in the fountain in the midst.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Aesculapius, Asclepius</i>&mdash;legendary Greek
  physician; son of Apollo and Coronis. His first teacher was the wise centaur
  Chiron. When he became so skillful in healing that he could revive the dead,
  Zeus killed him. Apollo persuaded Zeus to make Asclepius the god of medicine.
  The worship of Asclepius is believed to have originated in Thessaly. Temples
  were built to him at Epidaurus, Cos, Pergamum, and later Rome, where his
  worship spread after a plague in 293 BCE. Treatments, including massage and
  baths, were given to the sick. The serpent and the cock were sacred to
  Asclepius. People who claimed descent from him and those who followed his
  teachings were known as Asclepiads. <a href=

  country. After many harrowing adventures with his companions, the Argonauts,
  and with the help of the sorceress Medea, he brought back the fleece. Medea,
  through her craft, arranged for Jason's cousin to be killed. Jason and Medea
  then went into exile, raised a family, and lived happily, until Jason
  announced plans to divorce Medea and marry a princess. Medea, enraged, killed
  the children she had borne Jason and Jason's bride as well and used her magic

  <p>The dignity of drama was the essence of all Roman ceremony. The
  formalities of greeting were observed as elegantly, and with far more evident
  sincerity, in Cornificia's house than in Caesar's palace. Cornificia, dressed
  in white and wearing very little jewelry, received her guests more like an
  old-time patrician matron than a notorious modern concubine. Her notoriety,
  in fact, was due to Flavia Titiana, rather than to any indiscretions of her
  own. To justify her infidelities, which were a byword, Pertinax' lawful wife
  went to ingenious lengths to blacken Cornificia's reputation, regaling all
  society with her invented tales about the lewd attractions Cornificia staged
  to keep Pertinax held in her toils.</p>

  <p>That Cornificia did exercise a sway over the governor of Rome was
  undeniable. He worshiped her and made no secret of it. But she held him by a
  method diametrically contrary to that which rumor, stirred by Flavia Titiana,
  indicated; Cornificia's house was a place where he could lay aside the
  feverish activities of public life and revel in the intellectual and
  philosophical amusements that he genuinely loved.</p>

  <p>But Livius loathed her. Among other things, he suspected her of being in
  league with Marcia to protect the Christians. To him she represented the
  idealism that his cynicism bitterly rejected. The mere fact of her unshakable
  fidelity to Pertinax was an offense in his eyes; she presented what he
  considered an impudent pose of morality, more impudent because it was
  sustained. He might have liked her well enough if she had been a hypocrite,
  complaisant to himself.</p>

  <p>She understood him perfectly&mdash;better, in fact, than she understood
  Marcia, whose visits usually led to intricate entanglements for Pertinax.
  When she had sent the slaves away and the four lay at ease on couches in the
  shade of three exotic potted palms, she turned her back toward Livius,
  suspecting he would bring his motives to the surface if she gave him time;
  whereas Marcia would hide hers and employ a dozen artifices to make them
  undiscoverable.</p>

  <p>"You have not brought Livius because you think he loves me!" she said,
  laughing. "Nor have you come, my Marcia, for nothing, since you might have
  sent for me and saved yourself trouble. I anticipate intrigue! What plot have
  you discovered now? Is Pertinax its victim? You can always interest me if you
  talk of Pertinax."</p>

  <p>"We will talk of Livius," said Marcia.</p>

  <p>Leaning on his elbows, Livius glared at Caia Poppeia, Marcia's companion.
  He coughed, to draw attention to her, but Marcia refused to take the hint.
  "Livius has information for us," she remarked.</p>

  <p>Livius rose from the couch and came and stood before her, knitting his
  fingers together behind his back, compelling himself to smile. His pallor
  made the hastily applied cosmetics look ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"Marcia," he said, "you make it obvious that you suspect me of some
  indiscretion."</p>

  <p>"Never!" she retorted, mocking. "You indiscreet? Who would believe it?
  Give us an example of discretion; you are Paris in the presence of three
  goddesses. Select your destiny!"</p>

  <p>He smiled, attempted to regain his normal air of tolerant importance
&mdash;glanced about him&mdash;saw the sunlight making iridescent pools of
  fire within a crystal ball set on the fountain's edge&mdash;took up the
  ball and brought it to her, holding it in both hands.</p>

  <p>"What choice is there than that which Paris made?" he asked, kneeling on
  one knee, laughing. "Venus rules men's hearts. She must prevail. So into your
  most lovely hands I give my destiny."</p>

  <p>"You mean, you leave it there!" said Marcia. "Could you ever afford to
  ignore me and intrigue behind my back?"</p>

  <p>"I am the least intriguing person of your acquaintance, Marcia," he
  answered, rising because the hard mosaic pavement hurt his knee, and the
  position made him feel undignified. But more than dignity he loved
  discretion; he wished there were eyes in the back of his head, to see whether
  slaves were watching from the curtained windows opening on the inner court.
  "It is my policy," he went on, "to know much and say little; to observe much,
  and do nothing! I am much too lazy for intrigue, which is hard work, judging
  by what I have seen of those who indulge in it."</p>

  <p>"Is that why you sacrificed a white bull recently?" asked Marcia.</p>

  <p>Livius glanced at Cornificia, but her patrician face gave no hint. Caia
  Poppeia's was less under control, for she was younger and had nothing to
  conceal; she was inquisitively enjoying the entertainment and evidently did
  not know what was coming.</p>

  <p>"I sacrificed a white bull to Jupiter Capitolinus, as is customary, to
  confirm a sacred oath," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Very well, suppose you break the oath!" said Marcia.</p>

  <p>He managed to look scandalized&mdash;then chuckled foolishly,
  remembering what Pertinax had said about the value of an oath; but his own
  dignity obliged him to protest.</p>

  <p>"I am not one of your Christians," he answered, stiffening himself. "I am
  old-fashioned enough to hold that an oath made at the altar of our Roman
  Jupiter is sacred and inviolable."</p>

  <p>"When you took your oath of office you swore to be in all things true to
  Caesar," Marcia retorted. "Do you prefer to tell Caesar how true you have
  been to that oath? Which oath holds&mdash;the first one or the second?"</p>

  <p>"I could ask to be released from the second one," said Livius. "If you
  will give me time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Marcia's laugh interrupted him. It was soft, melodious, like wavelets on a
  calm sea, hinting unseen reefs.</p>

  <p>"Time," she said, "Is all that death needs! Death does not wait on oaths;
  it comes to us. I wish to know just how far I can trust you, Livius."</p>

  <p>Nine Roman nobles out of ten in Livius' position would have recognized at
  once the deadliness of the alternatives she offered and, preserving something
  of the shreds of pride, would have accepted suicide as preferable. Livius had
  no such stamina. He seized the other horn of the dilemma.</p>

  <p>"I perceive Pertinax has betrayed me," he sneered, looking sharply at
  Cornificia; but she was watching Marcia and did not seem conscious of his
  glance. "If Pertinax has broken his oath, mine no longer binds me. This is
  the fact then: I discovered how he helped Sextus, son of Maximus, to avoid
  execution by a ruse, making believe to be killed. Pertinax was also privy to
  the execution of an unknown thief in place of Norbanus, a friend of Sextus,
  also implicated in conspiracy. Pertinax has been secretly negotiating with
  Sextus ever since. Sextus now calls himself Maternus and is notorious as a
  highwayman."</p>

  <p>"What else do you know about Maternus?" Marcia inquired. There was a trace
  at last of sharpness in her voice. A hint conveyed itself that she could
  summon the Praetorians if he did not answer swiftly.</p>

  <p>"He plots against Caesar."</p>

  <p>"You know too little or too much!" said Marcia. "What else?"</p>

  <p>He closed his lips tight. "I know nothing else."</p>

  <p>"Have you had any dealings with Sextus?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>He was shifting now from one foot to the other, hardly noticeably, but
  enough to make Marcia smile. "Shall we hear what Sextus has to say to that?"
  asked Cornificia, so confidently that there was no doubt Marcia had given her
  the signal.</p>

  <p>Marcia moved her melting, lazy, laughing eyes and Cornificia clapped her
  hands. A slave came.</p>

  <p>"Bring the astrologer."</p>

  <p>Sextus must have been listening, he appeared so instantly. He stood with
  folded arms confronting them, his weathered face in sunlight. Pigment was not
  needed to produce the healthy bronze hue of his skin; his curly hair, bound
  by a fillet, was unruly from the outdoor life he had been leading; the strong
  sinews of his arms and legs belied the ease of his pretended calling and the
  starry cloak he wore was laughable in its failure to disguise the man of
  action. He saluted the three women with a gesture of the raised right hand
  that no man unaccustomed to the use of arms could imitate, then turning
  slightly toward Livius, acknowledged his nod with a humorous grin.</p>

  <p>"So we meet again, Bultius Livius."</p>

  <p>"Again?" asked Marcia.</p>

  <p>"Why yes, I met him in the house of Pertinax. It is three days since we
  spoke together. Three, or is it four, Livius? I have been busy. I
  forget."</p>

  <p>"Can Livius have lied?" asked Marcia. She seemed to be enjoying the
  entertainment.</p>

  <p>Livius threw caution to the winds.</p>

  <p>"Is this a tribunal?" he demanded. "If so, of what am I accused?" He tried
  to speak indignantly, but something caught in his throat. The cough became a
  sob and in a moment he was half-hysterical. "By Hercules, what judges! What a
  witness! Is he a two-headed* witness who shall swear my life away? I
  understand you, Marcia!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* At least two witnesses were necessary under Roman law.
  Author's note. ]</p>

  <p>"You?" she laughed. "You understand me?"</p>

  <p>He recovered something of his self-possession, a wave of virility
  returning. High living and the feverish excitement of the palace regime had
  ruined his nerves but there were traces still of his original astuteness. He
  resumed his air of dignity.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he said. "I have been overworked of late. I must see Galen
  about this jumpiness. When I said I understand you I meant, I realize that
  you are joking. Naturally you would not receive a highwayman in Cornificia's
  house, and at the same time accuse me of treason! Pray excuse my outburst
&mdash;set it to the score of ill-health. I will see Galen."</p>

  <p>"You shall see him now!" laughed Marcia, and Cornificia clapped her
  hands.</p>

  <p>Less suddenly than Sextus had appeared, because his age was beginning to
  tell on him, Galen entered the court through a door behind the palm-trees and
  stood smiling, making his old-world, slow salute to Marcia. His bright eyes
  moved alertly amid wrinkles. He looked something like the statues of the
  elder Cato, only with a kindlier humor and less obstinacy at the corners of
  the mouth. Two slaves brought out a couch for him and vanished when he had
  taken his ease on it after fussing a little because the sun was in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"My trade is to oppose death diplomatically," he remarked. "I am a poor
  diplomatist. I only gain a little here and there. Death wins inevitably.
  Nevertheless, they only summon me for consultation when they hope to gain a
  year or two for somebody. Marcia, unless you let Bultius Livius use that
  couch he will swoon. I warn you. The man's heart is weak. He has more brain
  than heart," he added. "How is our astrologer?"</p>

  <p>He greeted Sextus with a wrinkled grin and beckoned him to share his
  couch. Sextus sat down and began chafing the old doctor's legs. Marcia took
  her time about letting Livius be seated.</p>

  <p>"You heard Galen?" she asked. "We are here to cheat death
  diplomatically."</p>

  <p>"Whose death?" Livius demanded.</p>

  <p>"Rome's!" said Marcia, her eyes intently on his face. "If Rome should
  split in three parts it would fall asunder. None but Commodus can save us
  from a civil war. We are here to learn what Bultius Livius can do to preserve
  the life of Commodus."</p>

  <p>Livius' face, grotesque already with its hastily smeared carmine, assumed
  new bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"I have seen men tortured who were less ready to betray themselves," said
  Galen. "Give him wine&mdash;strong wine, that is my advice."</p>

  <p>But Marcia preferred her victim thoroughly subjected.</p>

  <p>"Fill your eyes with sunlight, Livius. Breathe deep! You look and breathe
  your last, unless you satisfy me! This astrologer, who is not Sextus&mdash;
  mark that! I have said he is not Sextus. Galen certified to Sextus' death and
  there were twenty other witnesses. Nor is he Maternus the highwayman.
  Maternus was crucified. That other Maternus, who is rumored to live in the
  Aventine Hills, is an imaginary person&mdash;a mere name used by runaways
  who take to robbery. This astrologer, I say, reports that you know all the
  secrets of the factions that are separately plotting to destroy our
  Commodus."</p>

  <p>Livius did not answer, although she paused to give him time.</p>

  <p>"You said you understood me, Livius. But it is I who understand you
&mdash;utterly! To you any price is satisfactory if your own skin and
  perquisites are safe. You are as crafty a spy as any rat in the palace
  cellars. You have kept yourself informed in order to get the pickings when
  you see at last which side to take. Careful, very clever of you, Livius! But
  have you ever seen an eagle rob a fish-hawk of its catch?"</p>

  <p>"Why waste time?" Cornificia asked impatiently. "He forced himself on
  Pertinax, who should have had him murdered, only Pertinax is too indifferent
  to his own&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Too philosophical!" corrected Galen.</p>

  <p>Then Caia Poppeia spoke up, in a young, hard voice that had none of
  Marcia's honeyed charm. No doubt of her was possible; she could be cruel for
  the sake of cruelty and loyal for the sake of pride. Her beauty was a mere
  means to an end&mdash;the end intrigue, for the impassionate excitement of
  it. She was straight-lipped, with a smile that flickered, and a hard light in
  her blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"It was I who learned you spy on Marcia. I know, too, that you keep a spy
  in Britain,&mdash;one in Gaul, another in Severus' camp. I read the last
  nine letters they sent you. I showed them to Marcia."</p>

  <p>"I kept one," Marcia added. "It came yesterday. It compromises you
  beyond&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I yield!" said Livius, his knees beginning to look weak.</p>

  <p>"To whom? To me?" asked Sextus, standing up abruptly and confronting him
  with folded arms. "Who stole the list I sent to Pertinax, of names of the
  important men who are intriguing for Severus, and for Pescennius Niger, and
  for Clodius Albinus?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" Livius shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"None knew of that list but you!" said Sextus. "You heard me speak of it
  to Pertinax. You heard me promise I would send it to him. None but you and he
  and I knew who the messenger would be. Where is the messenger?"</p>

  <p>"In the sewers probably!" said Marcia. "The list is more important."</p>

  <p>"If it isn't in the sewers, too," said Livius, snatching at a straw. "By
  Hercules, I know nothing of a list."</p>

  <p>"Then you shall drown with Sextus' slave in the Cloaca Maxima, the great
  sewer of Rome," said Marcia. "Not that I need the list. I know what names are
  written on it. But if it should have fallen into Caesar's hands&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shuddered, acting horror perfectly, and Livius, like a drowning man
  who thinks he sees the shore, struck out and sank!</p>

  <p>"You threaten me, but I am no such fool as you imagine! I know all about
  you! I perceive you have crossed your Rubicon. Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Summon the decurion and two men!" Marcia interrupted, glancing at
  Cornificia. But she made a gesture with her hand that Cornificia interpreted
  to mean "do nothing of the kind!"</p>

  <p>Livius did not see the gesture. Rage, shame, terror overwhelmed him and he
  blurted out the information Marcia was seeking&mdash;hurled it at her in
  the form of silly, useless threats:</p>

  <p>"You wanton! You can kill me but my journal is in safe hands! Harm me
&mdash;cause me to be missing from the palace for a few hours, and they may
  light your funeral fires! My journal, with the names of the conspirators, and
  all the details of your daily intriguing, goes straight into Caesar's
  hands!"</p>

  <p>The climax he expected failed. There was no excitement. Nobody seemed
  astonished. Marcia settled herself more comfortably on the couch and Galen
  began whispering to Sextus. The two other women looked amused. Reaction
  sweeping over him, his senses reeled and Livius stepped backward, staggering
  to the fountain, where he sat down.</p>

  <p>"Bona Dea!* But the man took time to tell his secret!" Marcia exclaimed.
  "Poppeia, you had better take my litter to the palace and bring that minx
  Cornelia. I suspected it was she but wasn't sure of it. Don't give her an
  inkling of what you know. Go with her to her apartment and watch her dress;
  then make an excuse to keep her waiting in your room while you go back and
  search hers. Have help if you need it; take two of my eunuchs, but watch that
  they don't read the journal. Look under her mattress. Look everywhere. If you
  can't find the journal, bring Cornelia without it. I will soon make her tell
  us where it is."</p>

  Narcissus</h2>

  <p class="first">"A gladiator's life is not so bad if he behaves himself, and
  while it lasts," Narcissus said.</p>

  <p>He was sitting beside Sextus, son of Maximus, in the ergastulum* beneath
  the training school of Bruttius Marius, which was well known to be the
  emperor's establishment, although maintained in the name of a citizen. There
  was a stone seat at the end where sunlight poured through a barred window
  high up in the wall. To right and left, facing a central corridor, were cells
  with doors of latticed iron. Each cell had its own barred window, hardly a
  foot square, set high out of reach and the light, piercing the latticed
  doors, made criss-cross patterns on the white wall of the corridor. Narcissus
  got up, glanced into each cell and sat down again beside Sextus.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ergastulum, ergastula</i> (Latin)&mdash;a Roman
  building used to hold in chains dangerous slaves, or to punish other slaves.
  The ergastula was usually subsurface, built as a deep, roofed pit&mdash;
  large enough to allow the slaves to work within it and containing narrow
  spaces in which they slept... The term is also used to describe any small
  Roman prison. <i><a href=

  <p>"The trouble is, they don't," he went on. "If you let them out, they drink
  and get into poor condition; and if you keep them in, they kill themselves
  unless they're watched. These men are reserved for Paulus, and they know they
  haven't a chance against him."</p>

  <p>"Paulus' luck won't last forever," Sextus remarked grimly.</p>

  <p>"No, nor his skill, I suppose. But he doesn't debauch himself, so he's
  always in perfect condition."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you a man in here who might be made nervy enough to kill him?"
  Sextus asked. "They would kill the man himself, of course, directly
  afterward, but we might undertake to enrich his relatives."</p>

  <p>Narcissus shook his head.</p>

  <p>"One might have a chance with the sword or with the net and trident,
  though I doubt it. But Paulus uses a javelin and his aim is like lightning.
  Only yesterday at practise they loosed eleven lions at him from eleven
  directions at the same moment. He slew them with eleven javelins, and each
  one stone dead. Some of these men saw him do it, which hasn't encouraged
  them, I can tell you. In the second place, they know Paulus is Commodus. He
  might just as well go into the arena frankly as the emperor, for all the
  secret it is. That substitute who occupies the royal pavilion when Commodus
  himself is in the arena no longer looks very much like him; he is getting too
  loose under the chin, although a year ago you could hardly tell the two
  apart. Even the mob knows Paulus is Commodus, although nobody dares to
  acclaim him openly. Send a gladiator in against another gladiator and even
  though he may know that the other man can split a stick at twenty yards, he
  will do his best. But let him know he goes against the emperor and he has no
  nerve to start with; he can't aim straight; he suspects his own three
  javelins and his shield and helmet have been tampered with. I myself would be
  afraid to face Paulus, being not much good with the javelin in any case,
  besides being superstitious about killing emperors, who are gods, not men, or
  the Senate and priests wouldn't say so. It is the same in the races: setting
  aside Caesar's skill, which is simply phenomenal, the other charioteers are
  all afraid of him."</p>

  <p>"If he isn't killed soon, Severus or one of the others will forestall us
  all," said Sextus. "Pertinax has only one chance: to be on the throne before
  the other candidates know what is happening."</p>

  <p>Narcissus' bronze face lighted with a sudden smile that rippled all around
  the corners of his mouth, so that he looked like a genial satyr.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of killing," he said, "Marcia has ordered me to kill you the
  moment you make up your mind the time has come to strike!"</p>

  <p>"You promised her, of course?"</p>

  <p>"No, as it happens we were interrupted. But she relies on me and if she
  ever begins to suspect me I would rather die in the arena than be racked and
  burned!"</p>

  <p>"Why not then? How is this for a proposal?" Sextus touched him on the
  shoulder. "Substitute yourself and me for two of these men! Send me in
  against him first. If he kills me, you next. One of us might get him. I am
  lucky. I believe the gods are interested in me, I have had so many escapes
  from death."</p>

  <p>"I haven't much faith in the gods," said Narcissus. "They may be all like
  Commodus. I heard Galen say that men created gods in their own image."</p>

  <p>Sextus smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"You have been listening, I suppose, to Marcia and her Christians."</p>

  <p>"Listening, yes, but I don't lean either way. It doesn't seem to me that
  Christianity can do much for a man when javelins are in the air. And besides,
  to be frank with you, Sextus, I rather hope to make a little something for
  myself. God though he is said to be, I would like to see Commodus killed for
  I loathe him. But I hope to survive him and obtain my freedom. Pertinax would
  manumit me. That is why I applied for the post of trainer in this beastly
  ergastulum. It is bad enough to have to endure the gloom of men virtually
  condemned to death and looking for a chance to kill themselves, but it is
  better than treading the sand to have one's liver split, one's throat cut,
  and be dragged out with the hooks. I have fought many a fight, but I liked
  each one less than the last."</p>

  <p>He got up and strode again along the corridor, glancing into the cells,
  where gladiators sat fettered to the wall.</p>

  <p>"This whole business is getting too confused for me," he grumbled, sitting
  down again. "You want to kill Commodus, as is reasonable. Marcia has ordered
  me to kill you, which is unreasonable! Yet for the present she protects you.
  Why? She knows you are Commodus' enemy. She seems anxious to save Commodus.
  Yet she encourages Pertinax, who doesn't want to be emperor; he only dallies
  with the thought because Marcia helps Cornificia to persuade him! Isn't that
  a confusion for you? And now there's Bultius Livius. As I understand it,
  Marcia caught him spying on her. No woman in her senses would trust Livius;
  the man has snowbroth in his veins and slow fire in his head. Yet Marcia now
  heaps favors on him!"</p>

  <p>"That is my doing," said Sextus.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad then, too?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe! I have persuaded Marcia that, now she has possession of the
  journal Livius was keeping, she can henceforth hold that over him and use him
  to advantage. She can win his gratitude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He has none!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and at the same time hold over him the threat of exposure for
  connection with the Severus faction, and the Pescennius faction, and the
  Clodius Albinus faction. He had it all down in his journal. He can easily be
  involved in those conspiracies if Marcia isn't satisfied with his spying in
  her behalf."</p>

  <p>"Gemini! The man will break down under the strain. He has no stamina. He
  will denounce us all."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope so," Sextus answered. "I am counting on it. Nothing but
  sudden danger will ever bring Pertinax up to the mark! I gave a bond to
  Marcia for Livius' life."</p>

  <p>"Jupiter! What kind of bond? And what has come over Marcia that she
  accepted it?"</p>

  <p>"I guaranteed to her that I will not denounce herself to Commodus! She saw
  the point. She could never clear herself."</p>

  <p>"But how could you denounce her? She can have you seized and silenced any
  time! Weren't you in Cornificia's house, with the guard at the gate? Why
  didn't she summon the Praetorians and hand you over to them?"</p>

  <p>"Because Galen was there, too. She loves him, trusts him, and Galen is my
  friend. Besides, Pertinax would turn on her if she should have me killed.
  Pertinax was my father's friend, and is mine. Marcia's only chance, if
  Commodus should lose his life, is for Pertinax to seize the throne and
  continue to be her friend and protect her. Any other possible successor to
  Commodus would have her head off in the same hour."</p>

  <p>"Well, Sextus, that argument won't keep her from having you murdered. I am
  only hoping she won't order me to do it, because the cat will be out of the
  bag then. I will not refuse, but I will certainly not kill you, and that will
  mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You forget Norbanus and my freedmen," Sextus interrupted. "She knows very
  well that they know all my secrets. They would avenge me instantly by sending
  Commodus full information of the plot, involving Marcia head over heels. She
  is ready to betray Commodus if that should seem the safest course. If she is
  capable of treachery to him, she is equally sure to betray all her friends if
  she thought her own life were in danger!"</p>

  <p>"Now listen, Sextus, and don't speak too loud or they'll hear you in the
  cells; any of these poor devils would jump at a chance to save his own skin
  by betraying you and me. Talk softly. I say, listen! There isn't any safety
  anywhere with all these factions plotting each against the other, none
  knowing which will strike first and Commodus likely to pounce on all of them
  at any minute. I don't know why he hasn't heard of it already."</p>

  <p>"He is too busy training his body to have time to use his brain," said
  Sextus. "However, go on."</p>

  <p>"I think Commodus is quite likely to have the best of it!" Narcissus said,
  screwing up his eyes as if he gazed at an antagonist across the dazzling sand
  of the arena. "Somebody&mdash;some spy&mdash;is sure to inform him. There
  will be wholesale proscriptions. Commodus will try to scare Severus, Niger
  and Albinus by slaughtering their supporters here in Rome. I can see what is
  coming."</p>

  <p>"Are you, too, a god&mdash;like Commodus&mdash;that you can see so
  shrewdly?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind. I can see. And I can see a better way for you, and for me
  also. You have made yourself a great name as Maternus, less, possibly, in
  Rome than on the countryside. You have more to begin with than ever Spartacus
  had&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aye, and less, too," Sextus interrupted. "For I lack his confidence that
  Rome can be brought to her knees by an army of slaves. I lack his willingness
  to try to do it. Rome must be saved by honorable Romans, who have Rome at
  heart and not their own personal ambition. No army of runaway slaves can ever
  do it. Nothing offends me more than that Commodus makes slaves his ministers,
  and I mean by that no offense to you, Narcissus, who are fit to rank with
  Spartacus himself. But I am a republican. It is not vengeance that I seek. I
  will reckon I have lived if I have ridded Rome of Commodus and helped to
  replace him with a man who will restore our ancient liberties."</p>

  <p>"Liberties?" Narcissus wore his satyr-smile again. "It makes small
  difference to slaves and gladiators how much liberty the free men have! The
  more for them, the less for us! Let us live while the living is good, Sextus!
  Let us take to the mountains and help ourselves to what we need while
  Pertinax and all these others fight for too much! Let them have their too
  much and grow sick of it! What do you and I need beyond clothing, a weapon,
  armor, a girl or two and a safe place for retreat? I have heard Sardinia is
  wonderful. But if you still think you would rather haunt your old estates,
  where you know the people and they know you, so that you will be warned of
  any attempt to catch you, that will be all right with me. We can swoop down
  on the inns along the main roads now and then, rob whom it is convenient to
  rob, and live like noblemen!"</p>

  <p>"Three years I have lived an outlaw's life," Sextus answered, "sneaking
  into Rome to borrow money from my father's friends to save me the necessity
  of stealing. It is one thing to pretend to be a robber, and another thing to
  rob. The robber's name makes nine men out of ten your secret well-wishers;
  the deed makes you all men's enemy. How do you suppose I have escaped
  capture? It was simple enough. Every robber in Italy has called himself
  Maternus, so that I have seemed to be here, there, everywhere, aye, and often
  in three or four places at once! I have been caught and killed at least a
  dozen times! But all the while my men and I were safe because we took care to
  harm nobody. We let others do the murdering and robbing. We have lived like
  hermits, showing ourselves only often enough to keep alive the Maternus
  legend."</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't that better than risking your neck trying to make and unmake
  emperors?" Narcissus asked.</p>

  <p>"I risk my neck each hour I linger in Rome!"</p>

  <p>"Well then, by Hercules, take payment for the risk, and cut the risk and
  vanish!" exclaimed Narcissus. "Help yourself once and for all to a bag full
  of gold in exchange for your father's estates that were confiscated when they
  cut his head off. Then leave Italy, and let us be outlaws in Sardinia."</p>

  <p>Sextus laughed.</p>

  <p>"That probably sounds glorious to one in your position. I, too, rather
  enjoyed the prospect when I first made my escape from Antioch and discovered
  how easy the life was. But though I owe it to my father's memory to win back
  his estates, even that, and present outlawry is small compared to the zeal I
  have for restoring Rome's ancient liberties. But I don't deceive myself; I am
  not the man who can accomplish that; I can only help the one who can, and
  will. That one is Pertinax. He will reverse the process that has been going
  on since Julius Caesar overthrew the old republic. He will use a Caesar's
  power to destroy the edifice of Caesar and rebuild what Caesar wrecked!"</p>

  <p>Narcissus pondered that, his head between his hands.</p>

  <p>"I haven't Rome at heart," he said at last. "Why should I have? There are
  girls, whom I have forgotten, whom I loved more than I love Rome. I am a
  slave gladiator. I have been applauded by the crowds, but know what that
  means, having seen other men go the same route. I am an emperor's favorite,
  and I know what that means too; I saw Cleander die; I have seen man after
  man, and woman after woman lose his favor suddenly. Banishment, death, the
  ergastulum, torture&mdash;and, what is much worse, the insults the brute
  heaps on anyone he turns against&mdash;I am too wise to give that&mdash;"
  he spat on the flag-stones&mdash;"for the friendship of Commodus. And
  Commodus is Rome; you can't persuade me he isn't. Rome turns on its favorites
  as he does&mdash;scorns them, insults them, throws them on dung-heaps. That
  for Rome!" He spat again. "They even break the noses off the statues of the
  men they used to idolize! They even throw the statues on a dung-heap to
  insult the dead! Why should I set Rome above my own convenience?"</p>

  <p>"Well, for instance, you could almost certainly buy your freedom by
  betraying me," said Sextus. "Why don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Jupiter! How shall a man answer that? I suppose I don't betray you
  because if I did I should loathe myself. And I prefer to like myself, which I
  contrive to do at intervals. Also, I enjoy the company of honest men, and I
  think you are honest, although I think you are also an idealist&mdash;
  which, I take it, is the same thing as a born fool, or so I have begun to
  think, since I attend on the emperor and have to hear so much talk of
  philosophy. Look you what philosophy has made of Commodus! Didn't Marcus
  Aurelius beget him from his own loins, and wasn't Marcus Aurelius the
  greatest of all philosophers? Didn't he surround young Commodus with all the
  learned idealists he could find? That is what I am told he did. And look at
  Commodus! Our Roman Commodus! God Commodus! I haven't murdered him because I
  am afraid, and because I don't see how I could gain by it. I don't betray you
  because I would despise myself if I did."</p>

  <p>"I would despise myself if I should be untrue to Rome," Sextus answered
  after a moment. "Commodus is not Rome. Neither is the mob Rome."</p>

  <p>"What is then?" Narcissus asked. "The bricks and mortar? The marble that
  the slaves must haul under the lash? The ponds where they feed their lampreys
  on dead gladiators? The arena where a man salutes a dummy emperor before a
  disguised one kills him? The Senate, where they buy and sell the consulates
  and praetorships* and quaestorships?&dagger; The tribunals where justice goes
  by privilege? The temples where as many gods as there are Romans yell for
  sacrifices to enrich the priests? The farms where the slave-gangs labor like
  poor old Sisyphus and are sold off in their old age to the contractors who
  clear the latrines, or to the galleys, or, if they're lucky, to the
  lime-kilns where they dry up like sticks and die soon? There is a woman in a
  side-street near the fish-market, who is very rich and looks like Rome to me.
  She has so many gold rings on her fingers that you can't see the dirt
  underneath; and she owns so many brothels and wine-shops that she can even
  buy off the tax-collectors. Do I love her? Do I love Rome? No! I love you,
  Sextus, son of Maximus, and I will go with you to the world's end if you will
  lead the way."</p>

  <p>"I love Rome," Sextus answered. "Possibly I want to see her liberties
  restored because I love my own liberty and can't imagine myself honorable
  unless Rome herself is honored first. When you and I are sick we need a
  Galen. Rome needs Pertinax. You ask me what is Rome? She is the cradle of my
  manhood."</p>

  <p>"A befouled nest!" said Narcissus.</p>

  <p>"An Augean stable with a Hercules who doesn't do his work, I grant you!
  But we can substitute another Hercules."</p>

  sulkily.</p>

  <p>"He is old enough to wish to die in honor rather than dishonor. You and I,
  Narcissus, have no honor&mdash;you a slave and I an outlaw. Let us win,
  then, honor for ourselves by helping to heal Rome of her dishonor!"</p>

  <p>"Oh well, have it your own way," said Narcissus, unconvinced. "A brass as
  for your honor! The alternative is death or liberty in either case, and as
  for me, I prefer friendship to religion, so I will follow you, whichever road
  you take. Now go. These fellows mustn't recognize you. It is time to take
  them one by one into the exercising yard. I daren't take more than one at a
  time or they'd kill me even with the blunted practise-weapons. I wish they
  might face Commodus as boldly as they tackle me! I am a weary man, and many
  times a bruised one, I can tell you, when the night comes, after putting

  Stewed Eels</h2>

  <p class="first">The training arena where Commodus worked off energy and kept
  his Herculean muscles in condition was within the palace grounds, but the
  tunnel by which he reached it continued on and downward to the Circus
  Maximus, so that he could attend the public spectacles without much danger of
  assassination.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, a certain danger still existed. One of his worst frenzies of
  proscription had been started by a man who waited for him in the tunnel, and
  lost his nerve and then, instead of killing him, pretended to deliver an
  insulting message from the Senate. Since that time the tunnel had been lined
  with guards at regular intervals, and when Commodus passed through his
  mysterious "double" was obliged to walk in front of him surrounded by enough
  attendants to make anyone not in the secret believe the double was the
  emperor himself.</p>

  <p>No man in the known world was less incapable than Commodus of self-
  defense against an armed man. There was no deception about his feats of
  strength and skill; he was undoubtedly the most terrific fighter and
  consummate athlete Rome had ever seen, and he was as proud of it as Nero once
  was of his "golden voice." But, as he explained to the fawning courtiers who
  shouldered one another for a place beside him as he hurried down the
  tunnel:</p>

  <p>"How could Rome replace me? Yesterday I had to order a slave beaten to
  death for breaking a vase of Greek glass. I can buy a hundred slaves for half
  what that glass cost Hadrian. And I could have a thousand better senators
  tomorrow than the fools who belch and stammer in the curia, the Senate house.
  But where would you find another Commodus if some lurking miscreant should
  stab me from behind? It was the geese that saved the capitol. You cacklers
  can preserve your Commodus."</p>

  <p>They agreed in chorus, it would be Rome's irreparable loss if he should
  die, and certain senators, more fertile than the others in expedients for
  drawing his attention to themselves, paused ostentatiously to hold a little
  conversation with the guards and promise them rewards if they should catch a
  miscreant lurking in wait to attack "our beloved, our glorious emperor."</p>

  <p>Commodus overheard them, as they meant he should.</p>

  <p>"And such fulsome idiots as those expect me to believe they can frame
  laws!" He scowled over-shoulder. "Write down their names for me, somebody.
  The Senate needs pruning! I will purge it the way Galen used to purge me when
  I had the colic! Dioscuri! But these leaky babblers suffocate me!"</p>

  <p>He was true to the Caesarian tradition. He believed himself a god. He more
  than half-persuaded other men. His almost superhuman energy and skill with
  weapons, his terrific storms of anger and his magnetism overawed courtiers
  and politicians as they did the gladiators whom he slew in the arena. The
  strain of madness in his blood provided cunning that could mask itself
  beneath a princely bluster of indifference to consequences. He could fear
  with an extravagance coequal to the fury of his love of danger, and his fear
  struck terror into men's hearts, as it stirred his mad brain into
  frenzies.</p>

  <p>He made no false claim when he called Rome the City of Commodus and
  himself the Roman Hercules. The vast majority of Romans were unfit to
  challenge his contempt of them, and his contempt was never under cover for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>Debauchery, of wine and women, entered not at all into his private life
  although, in public, he encouraged it in others for the simple reason that it
  weakened men who otherwise might turn on him. He was never guilty of excesses
  that might undermine his strength or shake his nerves; there was an almost
  superhuman purity about his worship of athletic powers. He outdid the Greeks
  in that respect. But he allowed the legend of his monstrous orgies in the
  palace to gain currency, partly because that encouraged the Romans to debauch
  themselves and render themselves incapable of overthrowing him, and partly
  because it helped to cover up his trick of employing a substitute to occupy
  the royal pavilion at the games when he himself drove chariots in the races
  or fought in the arena as the gladiator Paulus.</p>

  <p>Men who had let wine and women ruin their own nerves knew it was
  impossible that anyone who lived as Commodus was said to do, could drive a
  chariot and wield a javelin as Paulus did. Whoever faced a Roman gladiator
  under the critical gaze of a crowd that knew all the points of fighting and
  could instantly detect, and did instantly resent pretense, fraud, trickery,
  the poor condition of one combatant or the unwillingness of one man to have
  at another in deadly earnest, had to be not only in the pink of bodily
  condition but a fighter such as no drunken sensualist could ever hope to be.
  So it was easy to suppress the scandal that the gladiator Paulus was the
  emperor himself, although half Rome half-believed it; and the substitute who
  occupied the seat of honor at the games&mdash;aging a little, growing a
  little pouchy under eyes and chin&mdash;was pointed to as proof that
  Commodus was being ruined by the life he led.</p>

  <p>The trick of making use of the same substitute to save the emperor the
  boredom of official ceremony, whenever there was no risk of the public coming
  close enough to detect the fraud, materially helped to strengthen the
  officially fostered argument that Commodus could not be Paulus.</p>

  <p>So the mystery of the identity of Paulus was like all court secrets and
  most secrets of intriguing governments, no mystery at all to hundreds, but to
  thousands an insoluble conundrum. The official propagandists of the court
  news, absolutely in control of all the channels through which facts could
  reach the public, easily offset the constant leakage from the lips of slaves
  and gladiators by disseminating artfully concocted news. Those actually in
  the secret, flattered by the confidence and fearful for their own skins,
  steadfastly denied the story when it cropped up. Last, but not least, was the
  law, that made it sacrilege to speak in terms derogatory to the emperor. A
  gladiator, though the crowd might almost deify him, was a casteless
  individual, unprivileged before the law, whom any franchised citizen would
  rate as socially far beneath himself. To have identified the emperor with
  Paulus in a voice above a whisper would have made the culprit liable to death
  and confiscation of his goods.</p>

  <p>The substitute himself, a man of mystery, was kept in virtual
  imprisonment. He was known as "Pavonius Nasor," not because that was his real
  name, which was known to very few people, but because of an old legend that
  the ghost of a certain Pavonius Nasor, murdered centuries ago and never
  buried, still walked in the neighborhood of that part of the palace where the
  emperor's substitute now led his mysterious, secret existence.</p>

  <p>There were plenty of whispered stories current as to his true identity.
  Some said he was an impoverished landholder whom Commodus had met by accident
  when traveling in Northern Italy. But it was much more commonly believed he
  was the emperor's twin brother, spirited away at birth by midwives, and the
  stories told to account for that were as remarkably unlikely as the tale
  itself; as for instance, that a soothsayer had prophesied how Commodus should
  one day mount the throne and that he and his twin brother would wreck Rome in
  civil war&mdash;a warning hardly likely to have had much weight with the
  father, Marcus Aurelius, although the mother was more likely to have given
  credence to it.</p>

  <p>Whatever the truth of his origin, Pavonius Nasor never ran the risk of
  telling it. He kept his sinecure by mastering his tongue, preserving almost
  bovine speechlessness. When he and Commodus met face to face he never seemed
  to see the joke of the resemblance, never laughed at Commodus' obscenely
  vivid jibes at his expense, nor once complained of his anomalous position. He
  appeared to be a man of no ambition other than to get through life as easily
  as might be&mdash;of no personal dignity, no ruling habits, but possessed
  of imitative talent that enabled him, without the slightest trouble, to adopt
  the very gait and gesture of the emperor whom he impersonated.</p>

  <p>As he strode ahead along the tunnel he received the guards' salute with
  merely enough nod of recognition to deceive an onlooker not in the secret.
  (It was Pavonius Nasor's half-indulgent, rather lazy smile that had persuaded
  Rome and even the Praetorian Guards that Commodus was an easy-going, sensual,
  good humored man.)</p>

  <p>There was a box at one end of the private arena, over the gate where the
  horses entered, so placed as to avoid the sun's direct rays. It was reached
  by a short stairway from an anteroom that opened on the tunnel. There was no
  other means of access to the box. It's wooden sidewalls, finished to resemble
  gilded eagle's wings, projected over the arena so that it was well screened
  and in shadow. There was none, observing from below, who could have sworn it
  had not been the emperor himself who sat in the box and watched Paulus the
  gladiator showing off his skill.</p>

  <p>The assembled gladiators, perfectly aware of Paulus' true identity, went
  through the farce of solemnly saluting as the emperor the man who stared down
  at them from beneath an awning's shadow between golden eagle's wings, and who
  returned the salute with a wave of the arm that all Rome could have
  recognized.</p>

  <p>Commodus, nearly as naked as when he was born, came running from a
  dressing room and pranced and leaped over the sand to bring the sweat-beads
  to his skin; then, snatching at the nearest gladiator, wrestled with him
  until the breathless victim cried for mercy; dropped him then, as crushed as
  if a python had left a job half-finished, and shouted for the ashen
  sword-sticks. In a minute, with a leather buckler on his left arm, he was
  parrying the thrusts and blows of six men, driving and so crowding them on
  one another's toes that only two could seriously answer the terrific flailing
  of his own ash stick. He named them, named his blow, and laid them one by
  one, half-stunned and bleeding on the sand, until the last one by a quick
  feint landed on him, raising a great crimson welt across his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well done!" Commodus exclaimed and smote him on the skull so fiercely
  that he broke the sword-stick. "You have killed him," said a senator as two
  men promptly seized the victim's arms to drag him out.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," said Commodus. "That blow I landed on him would have killed a
  horse. But he is fortunate. He dies proud&mdash;prouder than you ever will,
  Varronius! He got past Paulus' guard! Would you like to attempt it? Woman!
  How I loathe you soft, effeminate, sleek senators! You fear death and you
  fear life equally! Where is Narcissus? Where are those men who are to try to
  kill me at my birthday games?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer from Narcissus. Commodus forgot him in a moment,
  called for javelins and hurled them at a target, then at half-a-dozen
  targets, hitting all six marks exactly in the middle as he spun himself on
  one heel.</p>

  <p>"I am in fettle!" he exclaimed, clapping the back of the senator whom he
  had scurrilously insulted a moment ago. If he was conscious of applause from
  the group of courtiers and gladiators he gave no sign of it. What pleased him
  was his own ability, not their praises.</p>

  <p>"Lions!" he said. "Loose that big one!"</p>

  <p>"Paulus," a scarred veteran answered (they were all forbidden to address
  him by any other name in that arena), "you have ordered us to keep that
  fellow for the birthday games. If you keep killing all the best ones off at
  practise, what shall we do when the day comes? The last ship-load has arrived
  from Africa and already you have used up nearly half of them. There is no
  chance of another cargo arriving in time for the games. And besides, we have
  lacked corpses recently; that big one hasn't tasted man's flesh. He is hungry
  now. He will eat whatever we throw in, so let him taste the right meat that
  will make him savage."</p>

  <p>"Loose a leopard then."</p>

  <p>The veteran went off without a word to give his orders to the men below
  ground, whose duty it was to drag the cages to the openings of tunnels in the
  masonry through which the animals emerged into the sunlight. There were ten
  such openings on either side of the arena, closed by trapdoors, set in
  grooves, that could be raised by ropes from overhead.</p>

  <p>Commodus picked up one javelin and poised it. Half-a-dozen gladiators
  watched him, paying no attention to the doors, through any one of which the
  animal might come. They knew their Paulus, and were trained, besides, to look
  at death or danger with a curious, contemptuous calm. But the courtiers were
  nervous, grouping themselves where the sunlight threw a V-shaped shadow on
  the sand, as if they thought that semi-twilight would protect them.</p>

  <p>A wooden door rose squeaking in its grooves but Commodus kept his back
  toward it.</p>

  <p>"Women!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>His sudden scowl transformed his handsome face into a thing of horror. He
  began to mutter savagely obscene abuse. A leopard crept into the sunlight,
  tried to turn again but was prevented by the closing trap, and crouched
  against the arena wall.</p>

  <p>"Beware! The beast comes!" said a gladiator.</p>

  <p>"Hold your presumptuous tongue, you slave-born rascal!" Commodus retorted.
  "Take that yapping dog away and have him whipped!"</p>

  <p>A man stepped from the entrance gate to beckon the offending gladiator,
  who walked out with a look of hatred on his face. He paused once, hesitating
  whether to ask mercy, and thought better of it, shrugging his fine bronzed
  shoulders. The leopard left the wall and crept toward the center of the sand,
  his black and yellow beauty rippling in the sunlight and his shadow looking
  like death's trailing cloak. The courtiers seemed doubtful which of the two
  beasts to watch, leopard or emperor.</p>

  <p>"A spear!" said Commodus. A gladiator put it in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Varronius! It irks me to have cowards in the Senate! Let me see you try
  to kill that leopard!"</p>

  <p>Decadent and grown effeminate though Rome was, there was no patrician who
  had not received some training in the use of arms. Varronius took the spear
  at once, his white hands closing on the shaft with military firmness. But his
  white face gave the lie to the alacrity with which he strode out of the
  shadow.</p>

  <p>"Kill him, and you shall have the consulate next year!" said Commodus. "Be
  killed, and there will be one useless bastard less to clutter up the
  curia!"</p>

  <p>A flush of anger swept over the senator's pale face. For a moment he
  looked almost capable of lunging with the spear at Commodus&mdash;but
  Commodus was toying with the javelin. Varronius strode out to face the
  leopard, and the lithe beast did not wait to feel the spear-point. It began
  to stalk its adversary in irregular swift curves. Its body almost pressed the
  sand. Its eyes were spots of sunlit topaz. Commodus' frown vanished. He began
  to gloat over the leopard's subtlety and strength.</p>

  <p>"He is a lovelier thing than you, Varronius! He is a better fighter! He is
  manlier! He is worth more! He has kept his body stronger and his wits more
  nimble! He will get you! By the Dioscuri, he will get you! I will bet a
  talent that he gets you&mdash;and I hope he does! You hold your spear the
  way a woman holds a distaff&mdash;but observe the way he gathers all his
  strength in readiness to leap instantly in any direction! Ah!"</p>

  <p>The leopard made a feint, perhaps to test the swiftness of the spear-
  point. Leaping like a flash of light, he seemed to change direction in
  mid-air, the point missing him by half a hand's breadth. One terrific claw,
  outreaching as he turned, ripped open Varronius' tunic and brought a little
  stream of crimson trickling down his left arm.</p>

  <p>"Good!" Commodus remarked. "First blood to the braver! Who would like to
  bet with me?"</p>

  <p>"I!" Varronius retorted from between set teeth, his eyes fixed on the
  leopard that had recommenced his swift strategic to-and-fro stalking
  movement.</p>

  <p>"I have betted you the consulship already. Who else wants to bet?" asked
  Commodus.</p>

  <p>Before anyone could answer the leopard sprang in again at Varronius, who
  stepped aside and drove his spear with very well timed accuracy. Only force
  enough was lacking. The point slit the leopard's skin and made a stinging
  wound along the beast's ribs, turning him the way a spur-prick turns a horse.
  His snarl made Varronius step back another pace or two, neglecting his chance
  to attack and drive the spear-point home. The infuriated leopard watched him
  for a moment, ears back, tail spasmodically twitching, then shot to one side
  and charged straight at the group of courtiers.</p>

  <p>They scattered. They were almost unarmed. There were three of them who
  stumbled, interfering with each other. The nearest to the leopard drew a
  dagger with a jeweled hilt, a mere toy with a light blade hardly longer than
  his hand. He threw his toga over his left forearm and stood firm to make a
  fight for it, his white face rigid and his eyes ablaze. The leopard leaped
&mdash;and fell dead, hardly writhing. Commodus' long javelin had caught him
  in the middle of his spring, exactly at the point behind the shoulder-bone
  that leaves a clear course to the heart.</p>

  <p>"I would not have done that for a coward, Tullius! If you had run I would
  have let him kill you!"</p>

  <p>Commodus strode up and pulled out the javelin, setting one foot on the
  leopard and exerting all his strength.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Varronius. Do you see how deep my blade went? Pin-pricks are
  no use against man or animal. Kill when you strike, like great Jove with his
  thunderbolts! Life isn't a game between Maltese kittens; it's a spectacle in
  which the strong devour the weak and all the gods look on! Loose another
  leopard there! I'll show you!"</p>

  <p>He took the spear from Varronius, balanced it a moment, discarded it and
  chose another, feeling its point with his thumb. There was a squeak of
  pulleys as they loosed a leopard near the end of the arena. He charged the
  animal, leaping from foot to foot. He made prodigious leaps; there was no
  guessing which way he would jump next. He was not like a human being. The
  leopard, snarling, slunk away, attempting to avoid him, but he crowded it
  against the wall. He forced it to turn at bay. No eye was quick enough to see
  exactly how he killed it, save that he struck when the leopard sprang. The
  next thing that anybody actually saw, he had the writhing creature on the
  spear, in air, like a legion's standard.</p>

  <p>Then the madness surged into his brain.</p>

  <p>"So I rule Rome!" he exclaimed, and threw the leopard at the gladiators'
  feet. "Because I pity Rome that could not find another Paulus! I strike
  first, before they strike me!"</p>

  <p>They flattered him&mdash;fawned on him, but he was much too genuinely
  mad for flattery to take effect. "If you were worth a barrelful of rats I'd
  have a Senate that might save me trouble! Then like Tiberius* I might remain
  away from Rome and live more like a god. I've more than half a mind to let my
  dummy stay here to amuse you wastrels!" He glanced up at the box, where his
  substitute lolled and yawned and smiled. "All you degenerates need is some
  one you can rub yourselves against like fat cats mewing for a bowl of milk!
  By Hercules, now I'll show you something that will make your blood leap.
  Bring out the new Spanish team."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Tiberius</i> (42 BCE-37 CE)&mdash;second Roman

  BCE) his brother Drusus on the Rhine and the Danube. Augustus, his
  stepfather, compelled him (12 BCE) to divorce his wife, Vipsania Agrippina,
  and to marry Julia, the widow of Agrippa and daughter of Augustus. After the
  death of Drusus (9 BCE) he campaigned in Germany, and following a second
  consulship (7 BCE) he retired to Rhodes for seven years. On his return he was

  <p>With an imperious gesture he sent senators and gladiators to scatter
  themselves all over the arena. Not yet satisfied, he ordered all the guards
  fetched from the tunnel and arranged them in a similar disorder, so that
  finally no stretch of fifty yards was left without a man obstructing it.
  There was no spina down the midst, nor anything except the surrounding wall
  to suggest to a team of horses which the course might be.</p>

  <p>"Let none move!" he commanded. "I will crush the foot of any man who
  stirs!"</p>

  <p>Attendants, clinging to the heads of four gray stallions that fought and
  kicked, brought out his chariot and others shut the gate behind it. Commodus
  admired the team a minute, then examined the new high wheels of the gilded
  chariot, that was hardly wider than a coffin&mdash;a thing that a man could
  upset with a shove and built to look as flimsy as an egg shell. Suddenly he
  seized the reins and leaped in, throwing up his right hand.</p>

  <p>If he could have ruled his empire as he drove that chariot he would have
  far outshone Augustus, for whose memory men sighed. He managed them with one
  hand. There was magnetism sent along the reins to play with the dynamic
  energy of four mad stallions as gods amuse themselves with men. If empire had
  amused him as athleticism did there would have been no equal in all history
  to Commodus.</p>

  <p>In a chariot no other athlete could have balanced, on a course providing
  not one unobstructed stretch of fifty yards, he drove like Phoebus* breaking
  in the horses of the Sun, careering this and that way, weaving patterns in
  among the frightened men who stood like posts for him to drive around. He
  missed them by a hand's breadth&mdash;less! He took delight in driving at
  them, turning in the last half-second, smiling at a blanched face as he
  wheeled and wove new figures down another zigzag avenue of men. The frenzy of
  the team inspired him; the rebellion of the stallions, made mad by the
  persistent, sudden turns, aroused his own astonishing enthusiasm. He
  accomplished the impossible! He made new laws of motion, breaking them,
  inventing others! He became a god in action, mastering the team until it had
  no consciousness of any self-will, or of any impulse but to loose its full
  strength under the directing will of genius.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Phoebus</i> (Latin from Greek "phoibos", shining)
&mdash;synonym for Apollo, the Greek god of light; god of prophesy and
  poetry and music and healing; son of Zeus and Leto; twin brother of Artemis.

  Encyclopedia</i>, 6th edition. ]</p>

  <p>The team tired first. It was its waning speed that wearied him at last.
  The mania that owned him could not tolerate the anticlimax of declining
  effort, so his mood changed. He became morose&mdash;indifferent. He reined
  in, tossed the reins to an attendant and began to walk toward the tunnel
  entrance, clothed as he was in nothing but the practise loin-cloth of a
  gladiator.</p>

  <p>A dozen senators implored him to wait and clothe himself. He would not
  wait. He ordered them to bring his cloak and overtake him. Then he observed
  Narcissus, standing near the horse-gate, waiting to summon his trained
  gladiators for an exhibition:</p>

  <p>"Not this time, Narcissus. Next time. Follow me." He waited for a moment
  for Narcissus. That gave the substitute time to come down from the box and go
  hurrying ahead into the tunnel-mouth; he went so fast (for he knew the
  emperor's moods) that the attendants found it hard to keep up; most of them
  were half a dozen paces in the rear. A senator gave Commodus his cloak. He
  took Narcissus by the arm and strode ahead into the tunnel, muttering,
  ignoring noisy protests from the senators, who warned him that the guards
  were not yet there.</p>

  <p>Then there was sudden silence; possibly a consequence of Caesar's mood, or
  the reaction caused by chill and tunnel-darkness after sunlit sand. Or it
  might have been the shadow of impending tragedy. A long scream broke the
  silence, thrice repeated, horrible, like something from an unseen world.
  Instantly Narcissus leaped ahead into the darkness, weaponless but armed by
  nature with the muscles of a panther. Commodus leaped after him; his mood
  reversed again. Now emulation had him; he would not be beaten to a scene of
  action by a gladiator. He let his cloak fall and a senator tripped over
  it.</p>

  <p>There were no lamps. Something less than twilight, deepened here and there
  by shadow, filled the tunnel. By a niche intended for a sentry the attendants
  were standing helplessly around the body of a man who lay with head and
  shoulders propped against the wall. Narcissus and another, like knotted
  snakes, were writhing near by. There was a sound of choking. Pavonius Nasor
  was silent. He appeared already dead.</p>

  <p>"Pluto! Is there no light?" Commodus demanded. "What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"They have killed your shadow, sire!"</p>

  <p>"Who killed him?"</p>

  <p>"Men who sprang out of the darkness suddenly."</p>

  <p>"One man. Only one. I have him here. He lives yet, but he dies!" Narcissus
  said.</p>

  <p>He dragged a writhing body on the flagstones, holding it by one wrist.</p>

  <p>"He was armed. I had to throttle him to save my liver from his knife. I
  think I broke his neck. He is certainly dying," said Narcissus.</p>

  <p>Some one had gone for a lamp and came along the tunnel with it.</p>

  <p>"Let me look," said Commodus. "Here, give me that lamp!"</p>

  <p>He looked first at Pavonius Nasor, who gazed back, at him with stupid,
  passionless, already dimming eyes. A stream of blood was gushing from below
  his left arm.</p>

  <p>"Now the gods of heaven and hell, and all the strange gods that have no
  resting place, and all the spirits of the air and earth and sea, defile your
  spirit!" Commodus exploded. "Careless, irresponsible, ungrateful fool! You
  have deprived me of my liberty! You let yourself be killed like any sow under
  the butcher's knife, and dare to leave me shadowless? Then die like carrion
  and rot unburied!"</p>

  <p>He began to kick him, but the stricken man's lips moved. Commodus bent
  down and tried to listen&mdash;tried again, mastered impatience and at last
  stood upright, shaking both fists at the tunnel roof.</p>

  <p>"Omnipotent Progenitor of Lightnings!" he exploded. "He says he should
  have had stewed eels tonight!"</p>

  <p>The watching senators mistook that for a cue to laugh. Their laughter
  touched off all the magazines of Caesar's rage. He turned into a mania. He
  tore at his own hair. He tore off his loin-cloth and stood naked. He tried to
  kill Narcissus, because Narcissus was the nearest to him. His crashing
  centurion's parade voice filled the tunnel.</p>

  <p>"Dogs! Dogs' ullage! Vipers!" he yelled. "Who slew my shadow? Who did it?
  This is a conspiracy! Who hatched it? Bring my tablets! Warn the
  executioners! What is Commodus without his dummy? Vultures! Better have
  killed me than that poor obliging fool! You cursed, stupid idiots! You have
  killed my dummy! I must sit as he did and look on. I must swallow stinking
  air of throne-rooms. I must watch sluggards fight&mdash;you miserable,
  wanton imbeciles! It is Paulus you have killed! Do you appreciate that?
  Jupiter, but I will make Rome pay for this! Who did it? Who did it, I
  say?"</p>

  <p>Rage blinded him. He did not see the choking wretch whose wrist Narcissus
  twisted, until he struck at Narcissus again and, trying to follow him,
  stumbled over the assassin.</p>

  <p>"Who is this? Give me a sword, somebody! Is this the murderer? Bring that
  lamp here!"</p>

  <p>Bolder than the others, having recently been praised, the senator Tullius
  brought the lamp and, kneeling, held it near the culprit's face. The murderer
  was beyond speech, hardly breathing, with his eyes half-bursting from the
  sockets and his tongue thrust forward through his teeth because Narcissus'
  thumbs had almost strangled him.</p>

  <p>"A Christian," said Tullius.</p>

  <p>There was a note of quiet exultation in his voice. The privileges of the
  Christians were a sore point with the majority of senators.</p>

  <p>"A what?" demanded Commodus.</p>

  <p>"A Christian. See&mdash;he has a cross and a fish engraved on bone and
  wears it hung from his neck beneath his tunic. Besides, I think I recognize
  the man. I think he is the one who waylaid Pertinax the other day and spoke
  strange stuff about a whore on seven hills whose days are numbered."</p>

  <p>He had raised up the man's head by the hair. Commodus stamped on the face
  with the flat of his sandal, crushing the head on the flagstones.</p>

  <p>"Christian!" he shouted. "Is this Marcia's doing? Is this Marcia's
  expedient to keep me out of the arena? Too long have I endured that rabble! I
  will rid Rome of the brood! They kill the shadow&mdash;they shall feel the
  substance!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he turned on his attendants&mdash;pointed at the murderer and
  his victim:</p>

  <p>"Throw those two into the sewer! Strip them&mdash;strip them now&mdash;
  let none identify them. Seize those spineless fools who let the murder
  happen. Tie them. You, Narcissus&mdash;march them back to the arena. Have
  them thrown into the lions' cages. Stay there and see it done, then come and
  tell me."</p>

  <p>The courtiers backed away from him as far out of the circle of the
  lamplight as the tunnel-wall would let them. He had snatched the lamp from
  Tullius. He held it high.</p>

  <p>"Two parts of me are dead; the shadow that was satisfied with eels for
  supper and the immortal Paulus whom an empire worshiped. Remains me&mdash;
  the third part&mdash;Commodus! You shall regret those two dead parts of
  me!"</p>

  <p>He hurled the lighted lamp into the midst of them and smashed it, then, in
  darkness, strode along the tunnel muttering and cursing as he went&mdash;
  stark naked.</p>

  <p class="first">"He is in the bath," said Marcia. She and Galen were alone
  with Pertinax, who looked splendid in his official toga. She was herself in
  disarray. Her woman had tried to dress her hair on the way in the litter; one
  long coil of it was tumbling on her shoulder. She looked almost drunken.</p>

  <p>"Where is Flavia Titiana?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Out," said Pertinax and shut his lips. He never let himself discuss his
  wife's activities. The peasant in him, and the orthodox grammarian, preferred
  less scandalous subjects.</p>

  <p>Marcia stared long at him, her liquid, lazy eyes, suggesting banked fires
  in their depths, looking for signs of spirit that should rise to the
  occasion. But Pertinax preferred to choose his own occasions.</p>

  <p>"Commodus is in the bath," Marcia repeated. "He will stay there until
  night comes. He is sulking. He has his tablets with him&mdash;writes and
  writes, then scratches out. He has shown what he writes to nobody, but he has
  sent for Livius."</p>

  <p>"We should have killed that dog," said Pertinax, which brought a sudden
  laugh from Galen.</p>

  <p>"A dog's death never saved an empire," Galen volunteered. "If you had
  murdered Livius the crisis would have come a few days sooner, that is
  all."</p>

  <p>"It is the crisis. It has come," said Marcia. "Commodus came storming into
  my apartment, and I thought he meant to kill me with his own hands. Usually I
  am not afraid of him. This time he turned my strength to water. He yelled
  'Christians!' at me, 'Christians! You and your Christians!' He was unbathed.
  He was half-naked. He was sweaty from his exercise. His hair was ruffled; he
  had torn out some of it. His scowl was frightful&mdash;it was
  freezing."</p>

  <p>"He is quite mad," Galen commented.</p>

  <p>"I tried to make him understand this could not be a plot or I would
  certainly have heard of it," Marcia went on with suppressed excitement. "I
  said it was the madness of one fanatic, that nobody could foresee. He
  wouldn't listen. He out-roared me. He even raised his fist to strike. He
  swore it was another of my plans to keep him out of the arena. I began to
  think it might be wiser to admit that. Even in his worst moods he is
  sometimes softened by the thought that I take care of him and love him enough
  to risk his anger. But not this time! He flew into the worst passion I have
  ever seen. He returned to his first obsession, that the Christians plotted it
  and that I knew all about it. He swore he will butcher the Christians. He
  will rid Rome of them. He says, since he can not play Paulus any longer he
  will out-play Nero."</p>

  <p>"Where is Sextus?" Pertinax asked.</p>

  <p>"Aye! Where is Sextus!"</p>

  <p>Marcia glared at Galen.</p>

  <p>"We have to thank you for Sextus! You persuaded Pertinax to shield Sextus.
  Pertinax persuaded me."</p>

  <p>"You did it!" Galen answered dryly. "It is what we do that matters.
  Squealing like a pig under a gate won't remedy the matter. You foresaw the
  crisis long ago. Sextus has been very useful to you. He has kept you
  informed, so don't lower yourself by turning on him now. What is the latest
  news about the other factions?"</p>

  <p>Marcia restrained herself, biting her lip. She loved old Galen, but she
  did not relish being told the whole responsibility was hers, although she
  knew it.</p>

  <p>"There is no news," she answered. "Nobody has heard a word about the
  murder yet. Commodus has had the bodies thrown into the sewer. But there are
  spies in the palace&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To say nothing of Bultius Livius," Pertinax added. He was clicking the
  rings on his fingers&mdash;symptom of irresolution that made Marcia grit
  her teeth.</p>

  <p>"The other factions are watching one another," Marcia went on. "They are
  irresolute because they have no leader near enough to Rome to strike without
  warning. Why are you irresolute?" She looked so hard at Pertinax that he got
  up and began to pace the floor. "Severus and his troops are in Pannonia.
  Pescennius Niger is in Syria. Clodius Albinus is in Britain. The senators are
  all so jealous and afraid for their own skins that they are as likely as not
  to betray one another to Commodus the minute they learn that a crisis exists.
  If they hear that Commodus is writing out proscription lists they will vie
  with one another to denounce their own pet enemies&mdash;including you
&mdash;and me!" she added.</p>

  <p>"There is one chance yet," said Pertinax. "Bultius Livius may have enough
  wisdom to denounce the leaders of the other factions and to clear us. None of
  the others would be grateful to him. That Carthaginian Severus, for instance,
  is invariably spiteful to the men who do him favors. Bultius Livius may see
  that to protect us is his safest course, as well as best for Rome."</p>

  <p>He had more to say, but Marcia's scorn interrupted him. Galen
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Rome! He cares only for Bultius Livius. It is now or never,
  Pertinax!"</p>

  <p>Marcia's intense emotion made her appear icily indifferent, but she did
  not deceive Galen, although Pertinax welcomed her calmness as excusing
  unenthusiasm in herself.</p>

  <p>"Marcia is right," said Galen. "It is now or never. Marcia ought to know
  Commodus!"</p>

  <p>"Know him?" she exploded. "I can tell you step by step what he will do! He
  will come out of the bath and eat a light meal, but he will drink nothing,
  for fear of poison. Presently he will be thirsty and lonely, and will send
  for me; and whatever he feels, he will pretend he loves me. When the raging
  fear is on him he will never drink from anyone but me. He will take a cup of
  wine from my hands, making me taste it first. Then he will go alone into his
  own room, where only that child Telamonion will dare to follow. Everything
  depends then on the child. If the child should happen to amuse him he will
  turn sentimental and I will dare to go in and talk to him. If not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Galen interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Madness," he said, "resembles many other maladies, there being symptoms
  frequently for many years before the slow fire bursts into a blaze. Some die
  before the outbreak, being burned up by the generating process, which is like
  a slow fire. But if they survive until the explosion, it is more violent the
  longer it has been delayed. And in the case of Commodus that means that other
  men will die. And women," he added, looking straight at Marcia.</p>

  <p>"If he even pretends he loves me&mdash;I am a woman," said Marcia. "I
  love him in spite of his frenzies. If I only had myself to think of&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Think then!" Galen interrupted. "If you can't think for yourself, do you
  expect to benefit the world by thinking?"</p>

  <p>Marcia buried her face in her hands and lay face downward on the couch.
  She was trembling in a struggle for self-mastery. Pertinax chewed at his
  finger-nails, which were the everlasting subject of his proud wife's
  indignation; he never kept his fine hands properly; the peasant in him
  thought such refinements effeminate, unsoldierly. Cornificia, who could have
  made him submit even to a manicure, understood him too well to insist.</p>

  <p>"Galen!" said Marcia, sitting up suddenly.</p>

  <p>The old man blinked. He recognized decision sudden and irrevocable. He
  clenched his fingers and his lower lip came forward by the fraction of an
  inch.</p>

  <p>"I must save my Christians. What do you know about poisons?" she
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Less than many people," Galen answered. "I have studied antidotes. I am a
  doctor. Those I poisoned thought as I did, that I gave them something for
  their health. My methods have changed with experience. Doctoring is like
  statesmanship&mdash;which is to say, groping in the dark through mazes of
  misinformation."</p>

  <p>"Know you a poison," asked Marcia, "that will not harm one who merely
  tastes it, but will kill whoever drinks a quantity? Something without flavor?
  Something colorless that can be mixed with wine? Know you a safe poison,
  Galen?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;irresolution!" Galen answered. "I will not be made a victim
  of it. Who shall aspire to the throne if Commodus dies?"</p>

  <p>"Pertinax!"</p>

  <p>Pertinax looked startled, stroking his beard, uncrossing his knees.</p>

  <p>"Then let Pertinax do his own work," said Galen. "Rome is full of
  poisoners, but hasn't Pertinax a sword?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. And it has been the emperor's until this minute," Pertinax said
  grimly. "Galen tells us Commodus is mad. And I agree that Rome deserves a
  better emperor. But whether I am fit to be that emperor is something not yet
  clear to me. I doubt it. Whom the Fates select for such a purpose, they
  compel, and he is unwise who resists them. I will not resist. But let there
  be no doubt on this point: I will not slay Commodus. I will not draw sword
  against the man to whom I owe my fortune. I am not an ingrate. Sextus lives
  for his revenge. If you should ask me I would answer, Sextus planned this
  murder in the tunnel and the blow was meant for Commodus himself. I am
  inclined to deal with Sextus firmly. It is not too late. There is a chance
  that Commodus, deprived now of his opportunities to make himself a spectacle,
  may bend his energies to government. Madman though he is, he is the emperor,
  and if he is disposed now to govern well, with capable advisers, I would be
  the last to turn on him."</p>

  <p>"If he will be advised by you?" suggested Marcia, her accent tart with
  sarcasm. "What will you advise him about Sextus?"</p>

  <p>"There are plenty of ways of getting rid of Sextus without killing him,"
  said Pertinax. "He is a young man needing outlets for his energy and fuel for
  his pride. If he were sent to Parthia, in secret, as an agent authorized to
  penetrate that country and report on military, geographical and economic
  facts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He would refuse to go!" said Galen. "And if made to go, he would return!
  O Pertinax&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"Be quiet!" Pertinax retorted irritably. "I will not submit to being
  lectured. I am Governor of Rome&mdash;though you are Galen the philosopher.
  And I remember many of your adages this minute, as for instance: 'It is he
  who acts who is responsible.' To kill an emperor is easy, Galen. To replace
  him is as difficult as to fit a new head to a body. We have talked a lot of
  treason, most of it nonsense. I have listened to too much of it. I am as
  guilty as the others. But when it comes to slaying Commodus and standing in
  his shoes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Marcia interrupted.</p>

  <p>"By the great Twin Brethren, Pertinax! Who can be surprised that Flavia
  Titiana seeks amusement in the arms of other men! Does Cornificia endure such
  peasant talk? Or do you keep it to impose on us as a relief from her more
  noble conversation? Dea Dia! Had I known how spineless you can be I would
  have set my cap at Lucius Severus long ago. It may be it is not too
  late."</p>

  <p>She had him! She had pricked him in the one place where he could be
  stirred to spitefulness. His whole face crimsoned suddenly.</p>

  <p>"That Carthaginian!" He came and stood in front of her. "If you had
  favored him you should have foregone my friendship, Marcia! Commodus is bad
  enough. Severus would be ten times worse! Where Commodus is merely crazy,
  Lucius Severus is a calculating, ice-cold monster of cruelty! He has no
  emotions except those aroused by venom! He would tear out your heart just as
  swiftly as mine! As for plotting with him, he would let you do it all and
  then denounce you to the Senate after he was on the throne!"</p>

  <p>"Either it must be Severus, or else you!" said Marcia. "Which is it to
  be?"</p>

  <p>Pertinax folded his arms.</p>

  <p>"I would feel it my duty to preserve Rome from Severus. But you go too
  fast. Our Commodus is on the throne&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And writes proscription lists!" said Marcia. "Who knows what names are on
  the lists already? Who knows what Bultius Livius may have told him? Who knows
  which of us will be alive tomorrow morning? Who knows what Sextus is doing?
  If Sextus has heard of this crisis he will seize the moment and either arouse
  the Praetorian Guard to mutiny or else reach Commodus himself and slay him
  with his own hand! Sextus is a man! Are you no more than Flavia Titiana's
  cuckold and Cornificia's plaything?"</p>

  <p>"I am a Roman," Pertinax retorted angrily. "I think of Rome before myself.
  You women only think of passion and ambition. Rome&mdash;city of a thousand
  triumphs!" He turned away, pacing the floor again, knitting his fingers
  behind him. "Pertinax would offer up himself if he might bring back the
  Augustan days&mdash;if he might win the warfare that Tiberius lost. One
  Pertinax is nothing in the life of Rome. One life, three-quarters spent, is
  but a poor pledge to the gods&mdash;yet too much to be thrown away in vain.
  The auguries are all mixed nowadays. I doubt them. I mistrust the shaven
  priests who dole out answers in return for minted money. I have knelt before
  the holy shrine of Vesta,* but the Virgins were as vague as the Egyptian who
  prophesied&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Vesta</i>&mdash;in Roman religion and mythology,
  hearth goddess. She was highly honored in every household from early times to
  the beginning of Christianity. Her public cult maintained a sacred building
  in which her priestesses, the Vestal Virgins, tended the communal hearth and
  fire, which was never allowed to die out. Vesta was identified with the Greek
  Hestia. <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/ve/Vesta2.html">The Columbia
  Encyclopedia</a></i>, 6th edition. ]</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"What?" demanded Marcia.</p>

  <p>"That I should serve Rome and receive ingratitude. What else does any man
  receive who serves Rome? They who cheat her are the ones who prosper!"</p>

  <p>"Send for Cornificia," said Marcia. "She keeps your resolution. Let her
  come and loose it!" Pertinax turned sharply on her.</p>

  <p>"Flavia Titiana shall not suffer that indignity. Cornificia can not enter
  this house."</p>

  <p>But the mention of Cornificia's name wrought just as swift a change in him
  as had the name of Lucius Severus. He began to bite his finger-nails, then
  clenched his hands again behind him, Galen and Marcia watching.</p>

  <p>"You are the only one who can replace Commodus without drenching Rome in
  blood," said Marcia, remembering a phrase of Cornificia's. And since the
  words were Cornificia's, and stirred the chords of many memories, they
  produced a sort of half-way resolution.</p>

  <p>"It is now or never," Marcia said, goading him. But Pertinax shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I am not convinced, though I would do my best to save Rome from Severus.
  Dioscuri!&mdash;do you realize, this plot to make me emperor is known to
  not more than a dozen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Therein safety lies," said Marcia. "Yourself included there can only be a
  dozen traitors!"</p>

  <p>"Rome is too much ruled by women! I will not kill Commodus, and I will
  give him this one chance," said Pertinax. "I will protect him, unless and
  until I shall discover proof that he intends to turn on you, or me, or any of
  my friends."</p>

  <p>"You may discover that too late!" said Marcia; but she seemed to
  understand him and looked satisfied. "Come tonight to the palace&mdash;
  Galen," she added, "come you also&mdash;and bring poison!"</p>

  <p>Galen met her gaze and shut his lips tight.</p>

  <p>"Galen," she said, "either you will do this or&mdash;I have been your
  friend. Now be you mine! It is too risky to send one of my slaves to fetch a
  poison. You are to come tonight and bring the poison with you. Otherwise
&mdash;you understand?"</p>

  <p>"You are extremely comprehensible!" said Galen, pursing up his lips.</p>

  <p>"You will obey?"</p>

  <p>"I must," said Galen. But he did not say whether he would obey her or his
  inclination. Pertinax, eyeing him doubtfully, seemed torn between suspicion
  of him and respect for long-tried friendship.</p>

  <p>"May we depend on you?" he asked. He laid a hand on Galen's shoulder,
  bending over him.</p>

  <p>"I am an old man," Galen answered. "In any event I have not long to live.
  I will do my best&mdash;for you."</p>

  <p>Pertinax nodded, but there was still a question in his mind. He bade
  farewell to Marcia, turning his back toward Galen. Marcia whispered:</p>

  <p>"Be a man now, Pertinax! If we should lose this gamble, we two can drink
  the stuff that Galen brings."</p>

  <p>"There was a falling star last night," said Pertinax. "Whose was it?"</p>

  <p>Marcia studied his face a moment. Then:</p>

  <p>"There will be a rising sun tomorrow!" she retorted. "Whose will it be?
  Yours! Play the man!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER 11.</a><br>
  Galen</h2>

  <p class="first">Galen's house was one he rented from a freedman of the
  emperor&mdash;a wise means of retaining favor at the palace. Landlords
  having influence were careful to protect good tenants. Furthermore, whoever
  rented, rather than possessed, escaped more easily from persecution. Galen,
  like Tyanan Apollonius, reduced his private needs, maintaining that
  philosophy went hand in hand with medicine, but wealth with neither.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant little house, not far away from Cornificia's, within a
  precinct that was rebuilt after all that part of Rome burned under Nero's
  fascinated gaze. The street was crescent-shaped, not often crowded, though a
  score of passages like wheel-spokes led to it; and to the rear of Galen's
  house was a veritable maze of alleys. There were two gates to the house: one
  wide, with decorated posts, that faced the crescent street, where Galen's
  oldest slave sat on a stool and blinked at passers-by; the other narrow,
  leading from a little high-walled courtyard at the rear into an alley between
  stables in which milch-asses were kept. That alley led into another where a
  dozen midwives had their names and claims to excellency painted on the doors
&mdash;an alley carefully to be avoided, because women of that trade, like
  barbers, vied for custom by disseminating gossip.</p>

  <p>So Sextus used a passage running parallel to that one, leading between
  workshops where the burial-urn makers' slaves engraved untruthful epitaphs in
  baked clay or inlaid them on the marble tomb-slabs&mdash;to be gilded
  presently with gold-leaf (since a gilded lie, though costlier, is no worse
  than the same lie unadorned.)</p>

  <p>He drummed a signal with his knuckles on the panel of a narrow door of
  olive-wood, set deep into the wall under a projecting arch. An overleaning
  tree increased the shadow, and a visitor could wait without attracting
  notice. A slave nearly as old as Galen presently admitted him into a paved
  yard in which a fish-pond had been built around an ancient well. A few old
  fruit-trees grew against the wall, and there were potted shrubs, but little
  evidence of gardening, most of Galen's slaves being too old for that kind of
  work. There were a dozen of them loafing in the yard; some were so fat that
  they wheezed, and some so thin with age that they resembled skeletons. There
  was a rumor that the fatness and the thinness were accounted for by Galen's
  fondness for experiments. Old Galen had a hundred jealous rivals and they
  even said he fed the dead slaves to the fish; but it was Roman custom to give
  no man credit for humaneness if an unclean accusation could be made to
  stick.</p>

  <p>Another fat old slave led Sextus to a porch behind the house and through
  that to a library extremely bare of furniture but lined with shelves on which
  rolled manuscripts were stacked in tagged and numbered order; they were
  dusty, as if Galen used them very little nowadays. There were two doors in
  addition to the one that opened on the porch; the old slave pointed to the
  smaller one and Sextus, stooping and turning sidewise because of the
  narrowness between the posts, went down a step and entered without
  knocking.</p>

  <p>For a moment he could not see Galen, there was such confusion of shadow
  and light. High shelves around the walls of a long, shed-like room were
  crowded with retorts and phials. An enormous, dusty human skeleton,
  articulated on concealed wire, moved as if annoyed by the intrusion. There
  were many kinds of skulls of animals and men on brackets fastened to the
  wall, and there were jars containing dead things soaked in spirit. Some of
  the jars were enormous, having once held olive oil. On a table down the midst
  were instruments, a scale for weighing chemicals, some measures and a
  charcoal furnace with a blow-pipe; and across the whole of one end of the
  room was a system of wooden pigeon-holes, stacked with chemicals and herbs,
  for the most part wrapped in parchment.</p>

  <p>Sunlight streaming through narrow windows amid dust of drugs and spices
  made a moving mystery; the room seemed under water. Galen, stooping over a
  crucible with an unrolled parchment on the table within reach, was not
  distinguishable until he moved; when he ceased moving he faded out again, and
  Sextus had to go and stand where he could touch him, to believe that he was
  really there.</p>

  <p>"You told me you had ceased experiments."</p>

  <p>"I lied. The universe is an experiment," said Galen. "Such gods as there
  are perhaps are looking to evolve a decent man, or possibly a woman, from the
  mess we see around us. Let us hope they fail."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"There appears to be hope in failure. Should the gods fail, they will
  still be gods and go on trying. If they ever made a decent man or woman all
  the rest of us would turn on their creation and destroy it. Then the gods
  would turn into devils and destroy us."</p>

  <p>"What has happened to you, Galen? Why the bitter mood?"</p>

  <p>"I discover I am like the rest of you&mdash;like all Rome. At my age
  such a discovery makes for bitterness." For a minute or two Galen went on
  scraping powder from the crucible, then suddenly he looked up at Sextus,
  stepping backward so as to see the young man's face more clearly in a shaft
  of sunlight.</p>

  <p>"Did you send that Christian into the tunnel to kill Commodus?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I? You know me better than that, Galen! When the time comes to slay
  Commodus&mdash;but is Commodus dead? Speak, don't stand there looking at
  me! Speak, man!"</p>

  <p>Galen appeared satisfied.</p>

  <p>"No, not Commodus. The blow miscarried. Somebody slew Nasor. A mistake. A
  coward's blow. If you had been responsible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When&mdash;if&mdash;I slay, it shall be openly with my own hand,"
  said Sextus. "Not I alone, but Rome herself must vomit out that monster. Why
  are you vexed?"</p>

  <p>"That wanton blow that missed its mark has stripped some friends of mine
  too naked. It has also stripped me and revealed me to myself. Last night I
  saw a falling star&mdash;a meteor that blazed out of the night and
  vanished."</p>

  <p>"I, too," said Sextus. "All Rome saw it. The cheap sorcerers are doing a
  fine trade. They declare it portends evil."</p>

  <p>"Evil&mdash;but for whom?" Old Galen poured the powder he had scraped
  into a dish and blinked at him. "Affiliations in the realm of substance are
  confined to like ingredients. That law is universal. Like seeks like,
  begetting its own like. As for instance, sickness flows in channels of
  unwholesomeness, like water seeping through a marsh. Evil? What is evil but
  the likeness of a deed&mdash;its echo&mdash;its result&mdash;its
  aftermath? You see this powder? Marcia has ordered me to poison Commodus!
  What kind of aftermath should that deed have?"</p>

  <p>Sextus stared at him astonished. Galen went on mixing.</p>

  <p>"Colorless it must be&mdash;flavorless&mdash;without smell&mdash;
  undetectable. These saviors of Rome prepare too much to save themselves! And
  I take trouble to save myself. Why?"</p>

  <p>He stopped and blinked again at Sextus, waiting for an answer.</p>

  <p>"You are worth preserving, Galen."</p>

  <p>"I dispute that. I am sentimental, which is idiocy in a man of my age. But
  I will not kill him who is superior to any man in Rome."</p>

  <p>"Idiocy? You? And you admire that monster?"</p>

  <p>"As a monster, yes. He is at least wholehearted. As a monster he lacks
  neither strength of will nor sinew nor good looks; he is magnificent; he has
  the fear, the frenzy and the resolution of a splendid animal. We have only
  cowardice, the unenthusiasm and the indecision of base men. If we had the
  virtue of Commodus, no Commodus could ever have ruled Rome for half a day.
  But I am senile. I am sentimental. Rather than betray Marcia&mdash;and
  Pertinax&mdash;who would betray me for their own sakes; rather than submit
  my own old carcass to the slave whom Marcia would send to kill me, I am doing
  what you see."</p>

  <p>"Poison for Commodus?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Not for yourself, Galen?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"For whom then?"</p>

  <p>"For Pertinax."</p>

  <p>Sextus seized the plate on which the several ingredients were being
  mixed.</p>

  <p>"Put that down," said Galen. "I will poison part of him&mdash;the mean
  part."</p>

  <p>"Speak in plain words, Galen!"</p>

  <p>"I will slay his indecision. He and Marcia propose; that I shall kill
  their monster. I shall mix a draught for Marcia to take to him&mdash;in
  case this, and in case that, and perhaps. In plain words, Commodus has sent
  for Livius and none knows how much Livius has told. Their monster writes and
  scratches out and rewrites long proscription lists, and Marcia trembles for
  her Christians. For herself she does not tremble. She has ten times Pertinax'
  ability to rule. If Marcia were a man she should be emperor! Our Pertinax is
  hesitating between inertia and doubt and dread of Cornificia's ambition for
  him; between admiration of his own wife and contempt for her; between the
  subtleties of auguries and common sense; between trust and mistrust of us
  all, including Marcia and you and me; between the easy dignity of being
  governor of Rome and the uneasy palace-slavery of being Caesar; between doubt
  of his own ability to rule and the will to restore the republic."</p>

  <p>"We all know Pertinax," said Sextus. "He is diffident, that is all. He is
  modest. Once he has made his decision&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Galen interrupted him</p>

  <p>"Then let us pray the gods to make the rest of us immodest! The decision
  that he makes is this: If Commodus has heard of the conspiracy; if Commodus
  intends to kill him, he will then allow somebody else to kill Commodus! He
  will permit me, who am a killer only by professional mistake and not by
  intention, to be made to kill my former pupil with a poisoned drink! You
  understand, not even then will Pertinax take resolution by the throat and do
  his own work."</p>

  <p>"So Pertinax shall drink this?"</p>

  <p>"It is meant that Commodus shall drink it. That is, unless Commodus
  emerges from his sulks too soon and butchers all of us&mdash;as we
  deserve!"</p>

  <p>"Have done with riddles, Galen! How will that affect Pertinax, except to
  make him emperor?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing will make him emperor unless he makes himself," said Galen. "You
  will know tonight. We lack a hero, Sextus. All conspirators resemble rats
  that gnaw and run, until one rat at last discovers himself Caesar of the herd
  by accident. Caius Julius Caesar was a hero. He was one mind bold and above
  and aloof. He saw. He considered. He took. His murderers were all
  conspirators, who ran like rats and turned on one another. So are we! Can you
  imagine Caius Julius Caesar threatening an old philosopher like me with death
  unless he mixed the poison for a woman to take to his enemy's bedside? Can
  you imagine the great Julius hesitating to destroy a friend or spare an
  enemy?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean, they strike tonight, and haven't warned me?"</p>

  <p>"I have warned you."</p>

  <p>"Marcia has been prepared these many days to kill me if I meant to
  strike," said Sextus. "I can understand that; it is no more than a woman's
  method to protect her bully. She accuses and defends him, fears and loves
  him, hates him and hates more the man who sets her free. But Pertinax&mdash;
  did he not bid you warn me?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Galen. "Are you looking for nobility? I tell you there is
  nothing noble in conspiracies. Pertinax and Marcia have used you. They will
  try to use me. They will blame me. They will certainly blame you. I advise
  you to run to your friends in the Aventine Hills. Thence hasten out of Italy.
  If Pertinax should fail and Commodus survives this night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, Galen. He must not fail! Rome needs Pertinax. That poison&mdash;
  phaugh! Is no sword left in Rome? Has Pertinax no iron in him? Better one of
  Marcia's long pins than that unmanly stuff. Where is Narcissus?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Galen. "Narcissus is another who will do well to
  protect himself. Commodus is well disposed toward him. Commodus might send
  for him&mdash;as he will surely send for me if belly-burning sets in. He
  and I would make a good pair to be blamed for murdering an emperor."</p>

  <p>"You run!" urged Sextus. "Go now! Go to my camp in the Aventines. You will
  find Norbanus and two freedmen waiting near the Porta Capena;* they are
  wearing farmers' clothes and look as if they came from Sicily. They know you.
  Say I bade them take you into hiding."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Porta Capena</i> (Latin)&mdash;a gate in the
  Servian Wall near Caelian Hill, in Rome ... It was one of the main entries to
  the city of Rome, since it opened on the Appian Way. The origin of the name
  is unknown, although it may refer to the fact that the road leads to Capua,
  an important city in Campania, south of Rome. <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porta_Capena">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>Galen smiled at him. "And you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Narcissus shall smuggle me into the palace. It is I who will slay
  Commodus, lest Pertinax should stain his hands. If they prefer to turn on me,
  what matter? Pertinax, if he is to be Caesar, will do better not to mount the
  throne all bloody. Let him blame me and then execute me. Rome will reap the
  benefit. Marcia has the Praetorian Guard well under control, what with her
  bribes and all the license she has begged for them. Let Marcia proclaim that
  Pertinax is Caesar, the Praetorian Guard will follow suit, and the Senate
  will confirm it so soon after daybreak that the citizens will find themselves
  obeying a new Caesar before they know the old one is dead! Then let Pertinax
  make new laws and restore the ancient liberties. I will die happy."</p>

  <p>"O youth&mdash;insolence of youth!" said Galen, smiling. He resumed his
  mixing of the powders, adding new ingredients. "I was young once&mdash;
  young and insolent. I dared to try to tutor Commodus! But never in my long
  life was I insolent enough to claim all virtue for myself and bid my elders
  go and hide! You think you will slay Commodus? I doubt it."</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>Sextus was annoyed. The youth in him resented that his altruism should be
  mocked.</p>

  <p>"Pertinax should do it," Galen answered. "If Rome needed no more than
  philosophy and grammar, better make me Caesar! I was mixing my philosophy
  with surgery and medicine while Pertinax was sucking at his mother's breast
  in a Ligurian hut. Rome, my son, is sick of too much mixed philosophy. She
  needs a man of iron&mdash;a riser to occasion&mdash;a cutter of Gordian
  knots, precisely as a sick man needs a surgeon. The Senate will vote, as you
  say, at the Praetorian Guard's dictation. You have been clever, my Sextus,
  with your stirring of faction against faction. They are mean men, all so full
  of mutual suspicion as to heave a huge sigh when they know that Pertinax is
  Caesar, knowing he will overlook their plotting and rule without bloodshed if
  that can be done. But it can't be! Unless Pertinax is man enough to strike
  the blow that shall restore the ancient liberties, then he is better dead
  before he tries to play the savior! We have a tyrant now. Shall we exchange
  him for a weak-kneed theorist?"</p>

  <p>"Are you ready to die, Galen?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Are you the only Roman? I am not so old I have no virtue left. A
  little wisdom comes with old age, Sextus. It is better to live for one's
  country than to die for it, but since no way has been invented of avoiding
  death, it is wiser to die usefully than like a sandal thrown on to the
  rubbish-heap because the fashion changes."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would speak plainly, Galen. I have told you all my secrets.
  You have seen me risk my life a thousand times in the midst of Commodus'
  informers, coming and going, interviewing this and that one, urging here,
  restraining there, denying myself even hope of personal reward. You know I
  have been whole-hearted in the cause of Pertinax. Is it right, in a crisis,
  to put me off with subtleties?"</p>

  <p>"Life is subtle. So is virtue. So is this stuff," Galen answered, poking
  at the mixture with a bronze spoon. "Every man must choose his own way in a
  crisis. Some one's star has fallen. Commodus'? I think not. That star blazed
  out of obscurity, and Commodus is not obscure. Mine? I am unimportant; I
  shall make no splendor in the heavens when my hour comes. Marcia's? Is she
  obscure? Yours? You are like me, not born to the purple; when a sparrow dies,
  however diligently he has labored in the dirt, no meteors announce his fall.
  No, not Maternus, the outlaw, to say nothing of Sextus, the legally dead man,
  can command such notice from the sky. That meteor was some one's who shall
  blaze into fame and then die."</p>

  <p>"Dark words, Galen!"</p>

  <p>"Dark deeds!" the old man answered. "And a path to be chosen in darkness!
  Shall I poison the man whom I taught as a boy? Shall I refuse, and be drowned
  in the sewer by Marcia's slaves? Shall I betray my friends to save my own old
  carcass? Shall I run away and hide, at my age, and live hounded by my own
  thoughts, fearful of my shadow, eating charity from peasants? I can easily
  say no to all those things. What then? It is not what a man does not, but
  what he does that makes him or unmakes him. There is nothing left but
  subtlety, my Sextus. What will you do? Go and do it now. Tomorrow may be too
  late."</p>

  <p>Sextus shrugged his shoulders, baffled and irritated. He had always looked
  to Galen for advice in a predicament. It was Galen, in fact, who had kept him
  from playing much more than the part of a spy&mdash;listening, talking,
  suggesting, but forever doing nothing violent.</p>

  <p>"You know as well as I do, there is nothing ready," he retorted. "Long ago
  I could have had a thousand armed men waiting for a moment such as this to
  rally behind Pertinax. But I listened to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And are accordingly alive, not crucified!" said Galen. "The Praetorian
  Guard is well able to slaughter any thousand men, to uphold Commodus or to
  put Pertinax in the place of Commodus. Your thousand men would only decorate
  a thousand gibbets, whether Pertinax should win or lose. If he should win,
  and become Caesar, he would have to make them an example of his love of law
  and order, proving his impartiality by blaming them for what he never invited
  them to do. For mark this: Pertinax has never named himself as Commodus'
  successor. I warn you: there is far less safety for his friends than for his
  enemies, unless he, with his own hand, strikes the blow that makes him
  emperor."</p>

  <p>"If Marcia should do it&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"That would be the end of Marcia."</p>

  <p>"If I should do it?"</p>

  <p>"That would be the end of you, my Sextus."</p>

  <p>"Let us say farewell, then, Galen! This right hand shall do it. It will
  save my friends. It will provide a culprit on whom Pertinax may lay the
  blame. He will ascend the throne unguilty of his predecessor's
  blood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you?" asked Galen.</p>

  <p>"I will take my own life. I will gladly die when I have ridded Rome of
  Commodus."</p>

  <p>He paused, awaiting a reply, but Galen appeared almost rudely
  unconcerned.</p>

  <p>"You will not say farewell?"</p>

  <p>"It is too soon," Galen answered, folding up his powder in a sheet of
  parchment, tying it, at great pains to arrange the package neatly.</p>

  <p>"Will you not wish me success?"</p>

  <p>"That is something, my Sextus, that I have no powders for. I have
  occasionally cured men. I can set most kinds of fractures with considerable
  skill, old though I am. And I can divert a man's attention sometimes, so that
  he lets nature heal him of mysterious diseases. But success is something you
  have already wished for and have already made or unmade. What you did, my
  Sextus, is the scaffolding of what you do now; this, in turn, of what you
  will do next. I gave you my advice. I bade you run away&mdash;in which case
  I would bid you farewell, but not otherwise."</p>

  <p>"I will not run."</p>

  <p>"I heard you."</p>

  <p>"And you said you are sentimental, Galen!"</p>

  <p>"I have proved it to you. If I were not, I myself would run!"</p>

  <p>Galen led the way out of the room into the hall where the mosaic floor and
  plastered walls presented colored temple scenes&mdash;priests burning
  incense at the shrine of Aesculapius, the sick and maimed arriving and the
  cured departing, giving praise.</p>

  <p>"There will be no hero left in Rome when they have slain our Roman
  Hercules," said Galen. "He has been a triton in a pond of minnows. You and I
  and all the other little men may not regret him afterward, since heroes, and
  particularly mad ones, are not madly loved. But we will not enjoy the rivalry
  of minnows."</p>

  <p>He led Sextus to the porch and stood there for a minute holding to his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"There will be no rivals who will dare to raise their heads," said Sextus,
  "once our Pertinax has made his bid for power."</p>

  <p>"But he will not," Galen answered. "He will hesitate and let others do the
  bidding. Too many scruples! He who would govern an empire might better have
  fetters on feet and hands! Now go. But go not to the palace if you hope to
  see a heroism&mdash;or tomorrow's dawn!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER 12.</a><br>
  Long Live Caesar!</h2>

  <p class="first">That night it rained. The wind blew yelling squalls along
  the streets. At intervals the din of hail on cobble-stones and roofs became a
  stinging sea of sound. The wavering oil lanterns died out one by one and left
  the streets in darkness in which now and then a slave-borne litter labored
  like a boat caught spreading too much sail. The overloaded sewers backed up
  and made pools of foulness, difficult to ford. Along the Tiber banks there
  was panic where the river-boats were plunging and breaking adrift on the
  rising flood and miserable, drenched slaves labored with the bales of
  merchandise, hauling the threatened stuff to higher ground.</p>

  <p>But the noisiest, dismalest place was the palace, the heart of all Rome,
  where the rain and hail dinned down on marble. There was havoc in the clumps
  of ornamental trees&mdash;crashing of pots blown down from balconies
&mdash;thunder of rent awnings and the splashing of countless cataracts
  where overloaded gutters spilled their surplus on mosaic pavement fifty or a
  hundred feet below. No light showed, saving at the guard-house by the main
  gate, where a group of sentries shrugged themselves against the wall&mdash;
  ill-tempered, shivering, alert. However mutinous a Roman army, or a legion,
  or a guard might be, its individuals were loyal to the routine work of
  military duty.</p>

  <p>A decurion stepped out beneath a splashing arch, the lamplight gleaming on
  his wetted bronze and crimson.</p>

  <p>"Narcissus? Yes, I recognize you. Who is this?" Narcissus and Sextus were
  shrouded in loose, hooded cloaks of raw wool, under which they hugged a
  change of footgear. Sextus had his face well covered. Narcissus pushed him
  forward under the guard-room arch, out of the rain.</p>

  <p>"This is a man from Antioch, whom Caesar told me to present to him," he
  said. "I know him well. His names is Marius."</p>

  <p>"I have no orders to admit a man of that name."</p>

  <p>Narcissus waxed confidential.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to get both of us into trouble?" he asked. "You know Caesar's
  way. He said bring him and forgot, I suppose, to tell his secretary to write
  the order for admission. Tonight he will remember my speaking to him about
  this expert with a javelin, and if I have to tell him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Speak with the centurion."</p>

  <p>The decurion beckoned them into the guard-house, where a fire burned in a
  bronze tripod, casting a warm glow on walls hung with shields and weapons. A
  centurion, munching oily seed and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand,
  came out of an inner office. He was not the type that had made Roman arms
  invincible. He lacked the self-reliant dignity of an old campaigner,
  substituting for it self-assertiveness and flashy manners. He was annoyed
  because he could not get the seed out of his mouth with his finger in time to
  look aristocratic.</p>

  <p>"What now, Narcissus? By Bacchus, no! No irregularities tonight! The very
  gods themselves are imitating Caesar's ill-humor! Who is it you have
  brought?"</p>

  <p>Narcissus beckoned the centurion toward the corner, between fire and wall,
  where he could whisper without risk of being overheard.</p>

  <p>"Marcia told me to bring this man tonight in hope of making Caesar change
  his mood. He is a javelin-thrower&mdash;an expert."</p>

  <p>"Has he a javelin under the cloak?" the centurion asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"He is unarmed, of course. Do you take us for madmen?"</p>

  <p>"All Rome is mad tonight," said the centurion, "or I wouldn't be arguing
  with a gladiator! Tell me what you know. A sentry said you saw the death of
  Pavonius Nasor. All the sentries who were in the tunnel at the time are under
  lock and key, and I expect to be ordered to have the poor devils killed to
  silence them. And now Bultius Livius&mdash;have you heard about it?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard Caesar sent for him."</p>

  <p>"Well, if Caesar has sent for this friend of yours, he had better first
  made sacrifices to his gods and pray for something better than befell poor
  Livius! Yourself too! They say Livius is being racked&mdash;doubtless to
  make him tell more than he knows. I smell panic in the air. With all these
  palace slaves coming and going you can't check rumor and I'll wager there is
  already an exodus from Rome. Gods! What a night for travel! Morning will see
  the country roads all choked with the conveyances of bogged up senators! Let
  us pray this friend of yours may soften Caesar's mood. Where is his admission
  paper?"</p>

  <p>"As I told the decurion, I have none."</p>

  <p>"That settles it then; he can't enter. No risks&mdash;not when I know
  the mood our Commodus is in! The commander might take the responsibility, but
  not I."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked Narcissus.</p>

  <p>"Where any lucky fellow is on such a night&mdash;in bed. I wouldn't dare
  to send for him for less than riots, mutiny and all Rome burning! Let your
  man wait here. Go you into the palace and get a written permit for him."</p>

  <p>But nothing was more probable than that such a permit would be
  unobtainable.</p>

  <p>Sextus stepped into the firelight, pulling back the hood to let the
  centurion see his face.</p>

  <p>"By Mars' red plume! Are you the man they call Maternus?"</p>

  <p>Sextus retorted with a challenge:</p>

  <p>"Now will you send for your commander? He knows me well."</p>

  <p>"Dioscuri! Doubtless! Probably you robbed him of his purse! By Romulus and
  Remus, what is happening to Rome? That falling star last night portended, did
  it, that a highwayman should dare to try to enter Caesar's palace! Ho there,
  decurion! Bring four men!"</p>

  <p>The decurion clanked in. His men surrounded Sextus at a gesture.</p>

  <p>"I ought to put you both in cells," said the centurion. "But you shall
  have a chance to justify yourself, Narcissus. Go on in. Bring Caesar's
  written order to release this man Maternus&mdash;if you can!"</p>

  <p>Narcissus, like all gladiators, had been trained in facial control lest an
  antagonist should be forewarned by his expression. Nevertheless, he was hard
  put to it to hide the fear that seized him. He supposed not even Marcia would
  dare openly to come to Sextus' rescue.</p>

  <p>"That man is my only friend," he said. "Let me have word with him
  first."</p>

  <p>"Not one word!"</p>

  <p>The centurion made a gesture with his head. The guards took Sextus by the
  arms and marched him out into the night, he knowing better than to waste
  energy or arouse anger by resisting.</p>

  <p>"Then I will go to the commander! I go straight to him," Narcissus
  stammered. "Idiot! Don't you know that Marcia protects Maternus? Otherwise,
  how should an outlaw whose face is so well known that you recognized him
  instantly&mdash;how should he dare to approach the palace?"</p>

  <p>The centurion touched his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Mad, I daresay! Go on in. Get Marcia's protection for him. Bring me her
  command in writing! Wait, though&mdash;let me look at you."</p>

  <p>He made Narcissus throw his heavy cloak off, clean his legs and change
  into his other foot-gear. Then he examined his costume.</p>

  <p>"Even on a night like this they'd punish me for letting a man pass who
  wasn't dressed right. Let me see, you're not free yet; you don't have to wear
  a toga. I spend half my days teaching clodhoppers how to fold hired togas
  properly behind the neck. It's the only way you can tell a slave from a
  citizen these days! The Praetorian Guard ought to be recruited from the
  tailors' shops! Lace up your sandal properly. Now&mdash;any weapons
  underneath that tunic?"</p>

  <p>Sullenly Narcissus held his arms up and submitted to be searched. He
  usually came and went unchallenged, being known as one of Caesar's favorites,
  but the centurion's suspicions were aroused. They were almost confirmed a
  moment later. The decurion returned and laid a long, lean dagger on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Taken from the prisoner," he reported. "It was hidden beneath his tunic.
  He looks desperate enough to kill himself, so I left two men to keep an eye
  on him."</p>

  <p>The centurion scratched his chin again, his mouth half-open.</p>

  <p>"Whom do you propose to visit in the palace?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Marcia," said Narcissus.</p>

  <p>The centurion turned to the decurion.</p>

  <p>"Go you with him. Hand him over to the hall-attendants. Bid them pass him
  from hand to hand into Marcia's presence. Don't return until you have word he
  has reached her."</p>

  <p>To all intents and purposes a prisoner, Narcissus was marched along the
  mosaic pavement of a bronze-roofed colonnade, whose marble columns flanked
  the approach to the palace steps. Drenched guards, posted near the eaves
  where water splashed on them clanged their shields in darkness as the
  decurion passed; there was not a square yard of the palace grounds
  unwatched.</p>

  <p>There was a halt beside the little marble pavilion near the palace steps,
  where the decurion turned Narcissus over to an attendant in palace uniform,
  but no comment; the palace was too used to seeing favorites of one day in
  disgrace the next.</p>

  <p>Within the palace there was draughtily lighted gloom, a sensation of dread
  and mysterious restlessness. The bronze doors leading to the emperor's
  apartments were shut and guards posted outside them who demanded extremely
  definite reasons for admitting anyone; even when the centurion's message was
  delivered some one had to be sent in first to find out whether Marcia was
  willing, and for nearly half an hour Narcissus waited, biting his lip with
  impatience.</p>

  <p>When he was sent for at last, and accompanied in, he found Marcia,
  Pertinax and Galen seated unattended in the gorgeous, quiet anteroom next to
  the emperor's bedchamber. The outer storm was hardly audible through the
  window-shutters, but there was an atmosphere of impending climax, like the
  hush and rumble that precedes eruptions.</p>

  <p>Marcia nodded and dismissed the attendant who had brought Narcissus. There
  was a strained look about her eyes, a tightening at the corners of the mouth.
  Her voice was almost hoarse:</p>

  <p>"What is it? You bring bad news, Narcissus! What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Sextus has been arrested by the main gate guard!"</p>

  <p>Galen came out of a reverie. Pertinax bit at his nails and looked
  startled; worry had made him look as old as Galen, but his shoulders were
  erect and he was very splendid in his jeweled full dress. None spoke; they
  waited on Marcia, who turned the news over in her mind a minute.</p>

  <p>"When? Why?" she asked at last.</p>

  <p>"He proposed I should smuggle him in, that he might be of service to you.
  He was stormy-minded. He said Rome may need a determined man tonight. But the
  centurion of the guard recognized him&mdash;knew he is Maternus. He refused
  to summon the commander. Sextus is locked in a cell, and there is no knowing
  what the guards may do to him. They may try to make him talk. Please write
  and order him released."</p>

  <p>"Yes, order him released," said Pertinax.</p>

  <p>But Marcia's strained lips flickered with the vestige of a smile.</p>

  <p>"A determined man!" she said, her eyes on Pertinax. "By morning a
  determined man might give his own commands. Sextus is safe where he is. Let
  him stay there until you have power to release him! Go and wait in the outer
  room, Narcissus!"</p>

  <p>Narcissus had no alternative. Though he could sense the climax with the
  marrow of his bones, he did not dare to disobey. He might have rushed into
  the emperor's bedroom to denounce the whole conspiracy and offer himself as
  bodyguard in the emergency. That might have won Commodus' gratitude; it might
  have opened up a way for liberating Sextus. But there was irresolution in the
  air. And besides, he knew that Sextus would reckon it a treason to himself to
  be made beholden for his life to Commodus, nor would he forgive betrayal of
  his friends, Pertinax, and Marcia and Galen.</p>

  <p>So Narcissus, who cared only for Sextus, reckoning no other man on earth
  his friend, went and sat beyond the curtains in the smaller, outer room,
  straining his ears to catch the conversation and wondering what tragedy the
  gods might have in store. As gladiator his philosophy was mixed of fatalism,
  cynical irreverence, a semi-military instinct of obedience, short-sightedness
  and self-will. He reckoned Marcia no better than himself because she, too,
  was born in slavery&mdash;and Pertinax not vastly better than himself
  because he was a charcoal-burner's son. But it did not enter his head just
  then that he might be capable of making history.</p>

  <p>Marcia well understood him. Knowing that he could not escape to confer
  with the slaves in the corridor, because the door leading to the corridor
  from the smaller anteroom was locked, she was at no pains to prevent his
  overhearing anything. He could be dealt with either way, at her convenience;
  a reward might seal his lips, or she could have him killed the instant that
  his usefulness was ended, which was possibly not yet.</p>

  <p>"Sextus," she said, "must be dealt with. Pertinax, you are the one who
  should attend to it. As governor of Rome you can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is thoroughly faithful," said Pertinax. "He has been very useful to
  us."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marcia, "but usefulness has limits. Time comes when wine jars
  need resealing, else the wine spills. Galen, go in and see the emperor."</p>

  <p>Galen shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He is a sick man," said Marcia. "I think he has a fever."</p>

  <p>Galen shook his head again.</p>

  <p>"I will not have it said I poisoned him."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Who knows that you mixed any poison?"</p>

  <p>"Sextus, for one," Galen answered.</p>

  <p>"Dea Dia! There you are!" said Marcia. "I tell you, Pertinax, your Sextus
  may prove to be another Livius! He has been as ubiquitous as the plague. He
  knows everything. What if he should turn around and secure himself and his
  estates by telling Commodus all he knows? It was you who trusted Livius. Do
  you never learn by your mistakes?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know yet what Livius has told," said Pertinax. "If he had been
  tortured&mdash;but he was not. Commodus slew him with his own hand. I know
  that is true; it was told me by the steward of the bedchamber, who saw it,
  and who helped to dispose of the body. Commodus swore that such a creeping
  spy as Livius, who could be true to nobody but scribbled, scribbled,
  scribbled in a journal all the scandal he could learn in order to betray
  anybody when it suited him, was unfit to live. I take that for a sign that
  Commodus has had a change of heart. It was a manly thing to slay that
  wretch."</p>

  <p>"He will have a change of governors of Rome before the day dawns!" Marcia
  retorted. "If it weren't that he might change his mistress at the same
  time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You would betray me&mdash;eh?" Pertinax smiled at her tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"No," said Marcia, "I would let you have your own way and be executed! You
  deserve it, Pertinax." Pertinax stood up and paced the floor with hands
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"I will have my own way. I will have it, Marcia!" he said, calmly, coming
  to a stand in front of her. "He who plots against his emperor may meet the
  like fate! If Commodus has no designs against me, then I harbor none against
  him. I am not sure I am fitted to be Caesar. I have none to rally to me, to
  rely on, except the Praetorian Guard, which is a two-horned weapon; they
  could turn on me as easily and put a man of their own choosing on the throne.
  And furthermore, I don't wish to be Caesar. Glabrio, for instance, is a
  better man than I am for the task. I will only consent to your desperate
  course, for the sake of Rome, if you can prove to me that Commodus designs a
  wholesale massacre. And even so, if your name and Galen's and mine are not on
  his proscription list&mdash;if he only intends, that is, to punish
  Christians and weaken the faction of that Carthaginian Severus, I will
  observe my oath of loyalty. I will counsel moderation but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are less than half a man without your mistress!" Marcia exploded.
  "Don't stand trying to impress me with your dignity. I don't believe in it! I
  will send for Cornificia."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Pertinax showed instant resolution. "Cornificia shall not be
  dragged in. The responsibility is yours and mine. Let us not lessen our
  dignity by involving an innocent woman."</p>

  <p>For a moment that made Marcia breathless. She was staggered by his
  innocence, not his assertion of Cornificia's&mdash;bemused by the man's
  ability to believe what he chose to believe, as if Cornificia had not been
  the very first who plotted to make him Caesar. Cornificia more than anyone
  had contrived to suggest to the Praetorian Guard that their interest might
  best be served some day by befriending Pertinax; she more than anyone had
  disarmed Commodus' suspicion by complaining to him about Pertinax' lack of
  self-assertiveness, which had become Commodus' chief reason for not
  mistrusting him. By pretending to report to Commodus the private doings of
  Pertinax and a number of other important people, Cornificia had undermined
  Commodus' faith in his secret informers who might else have been
  dangerous.</p>

  <p>"Your Cornificia," Marcia began then changed her mind. Disillusionment
  would do no good. She must play on the man's illusion that he was the master
  of his own will. "Very well," she went on, "Yours be the decision! No woman
  can decide such issues. We are all in your hands&mdash;Cornificia and Galen
&mdash;all of us&mdash;aye, and Rome, too&mdash;and even Sextus and his
  friends. But you will never have another such opportunity. It is tonight or
  never, Pertinax!"</p>

  <p>He winced. He was about to speak, but something interrupted him. The great
  door carved with cupids leading to the emperor's bedchamber opened inch by
  inch and Telamonion came out, closing it softly behind him.</p>

  <p>"Caesar sleeps," said the child, "and the wind blew out the lamp. He was
  very cross. It is dark. It is cold and lonely in there."</p>

  <p>In his hand he held a sheet of parchment, covered with writing and creased
  from his attempts to make a parchment helmet, "Show me," he said, holding out
  the sheet to Marcia.</p>

  <p>She took him on her knee and began reading what was written, putting him
  down when he tugged at the parchment to make her show him how to fold it. She
  found him another sheet to play with and told him to take it to Pertinax who
  was a soldier and knew more about helmets. Then she went on reading,
  clutching at the sheet so tightly that her nails blanched white under the
  dye.</p>

  <p>"Pertinax!" she said, shaking the parchment, speaking in a strained voice,
  "this is his final list! He has copied the names from his tablets. Whose name
  do you guess comes first?"</p>

  <p>Pertinax was playing with Telamonion and did not look at her.</p>

  <p>"Severus!" he answered, morbid jealousy, amounting to obsession, stirring
  that cynical hope in him.</p>

  <p>"Severus isn't mentioned. The first six names are in this order: Galen,
  Marcia, Cornificia, Pertinax, Narcissus, Sextus alias Maternus. Do you
  realize what that means? It is now or never! Why has he put Galen first, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>Galen did not appear startled. His interest was philosophical&mdash;
  impersonal.</p>

  <p>"I should be first. I am guiltiest. I taught him in his youth," he
  remarked, smiling thinly. "I taught him how to loose the beast that lives in
  him, not intending that, of course, but it is what we do that counts. I
  should come first! The state would have been better for the death of many a
  man whom I cured; but I did not cure Commodus, I revealed him to himself, and
  he fell in love with himself and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now will you poison him?" said Marcia.</p>

  <p>"No," said Galen. "Let him kill me. It is better."</p>

  <p>"Gods! Has Rome no iron left? You, Pertinax!" said Marcia, "Go in and kill
  him!"</p>

  <p>Pertinax stood up and stared at her. The child Telamonion pressed close to
  him holding his right hand, gazing at Marcia.</p>

  <p>"Telamonion, go in and play with Narcissus," said Marcia. She pointed at
  the curtains and the child obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Go in and kill him, Pertinax!" Marcia shook the list of names, then stood
  still suddenly, like a woman frozen, ash-white under the carmine on her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>There came a voice from the emperor's bedroom, more like the roar of an
  angry beast than human speech:</p>

  <p>"Marcia! Do you hear me, Marcia? By all Olympus&mdash;Marcia!"</p>

  <p>She opened the door. The inner room was in darkness. There came a gust of
  chill wet wind that made all the curtains flutter and there was a comfortless
  noise of cataracts of rain downpouring from the over-loaded gutters on to
  marble balconies. Then the emperor's voice again:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Marcia? You leave your Commodus to die of thirst! I parch
&mdash;I have a fever&mdash;bring my wine-cup!"</p>

  <p>"At once, Commodus."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the golden cup on an onyx table. On a stand beside it was
  an unpierced wine jar set in an enormous bowl of snow. She looked at Pertinax
&mdash;and shrugged her shoulders, possibly because the wind blew through
  the opened door. She glanced at Galen.</p>

  <p>"If you have a fever, shouldn't I bring Galen?"</p>

  <p>"No!" roared Commodus. "The man might poison me! Bring me the cup, and you
  fill it yourself! Make haste before I die of thirst! Then bring me another
  lamp and dose the shutters! No slaves&mdash;I can't bear the sight of
  them!"</p>

  <p>"Instantly, Commodus. I am coming with it now. Only wait while I pierce
  the amphora."</p>

  <p>She closed the door and looked swiftly once again at Pertinax. He frowned
  over the list of names and did not look at her. She walked straight up to
  Galen.</p>

  <p>"Give me!" she demanded, holding out her hand. He drew a little parchment
  package from his bosom and she clutched it, saying nothing. Galen was the one
  who spoke:</p>

  <p>"Responsibility is his who orders. May the gods see that it falls where it
  belongs."</p>

  <p>She took no notice of his speech but stood for a moment untying the
  strings of the package, frowning to herself, then bit the string through and,
  clutching the little package in her fist, took a gilded tool from beside the
  snow-bowl and pierced the seal of the amphora. Then she put the poison in the
  bottom of the golden cup and poured the wine&mdash;with difficulty, since
  the jar was heavy, but Pertinax, who watched intently, made no movement to
  assist. She stirred the wine with one of her long hair-pins.</p>

  <p>"Marcia!" roared Commodus.</p>

  <p>"I am coming now."</p>

  <p>She went into the bedroom, leaving the door not quite closed behind her.
  Pertinax began to stare at Galen critically. Galen blinked at him. Commodus'
  voice came very distinctly from the inner room:</p>

  <p>"Taste first, Marcia! Olympus! I can't see you in the dark. Come close.
  Are your lips wet? Let me feel them!"</p>

  <p>"I drank a whole mouthful, Commodus. How hot your hand is! Feel&mdash;
  feel the cup&mdash;you can feel with your finger how much I have tasted. I
  broke the seal of a fresh jar of Falernian."</p>

  <p>"Some of your Christians might have tampered with it!"</p>

  <p>"No, no, Commodus. That jar has been in the cellar since before you were
  born and the seal was intact. I washed the cup myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, taste again. Sit here on the bed where I can feel your
  heartbeats."</p>

  <p>Presently he gave a gasp and belched, as always after he had swallowed a
  whole cupful at one draught.</p>

  <p>"Now close the shutters and bolt them on the inside; there might be some
  of your Christians lurking on the balcony."</p>

  <p>"In this storm, Commodus? And there are guards on duty."</p>

  <p>"Close them, I say! Who trusts the guards! Did they guard the tunnel? I
  will rid Rome of all Christians tomorrow! Aye, and of many another reptile!
  They have robbed me of my fun in the arena&mdash;I will find another way to
  interest myself! Now bring me a fresh lamp in here, and set the tablets by
  the bed."</p>

  <p>She came out, shutting the door behind her, then stood listening. She did
  not tremble. Her wrist was red where Commodus had held it.</p>

  <p>"How long?" she whispered, looking at Galen.</p>

  <p>"Only a very little time," he answered. "How much did you drink?"</p>

  <p>She put her hand to her stomach, as if pain had stabbed her.</p>

  <p>"Drink pure wine," said Galen. "Swiftly. Drink a lot of it."</p>

  <p>She went to the amphora. Before she could reach it there came a roar like
  a furious beast's from the bedroom.</p>

  <p>"I am poisoned! Marcia! Marcia! My belly burns! I am on fire inside! I
  faint! Marcia!&mdash;Marcia!" Then groans and a great creaking of the
  bed.</p>

  <p>Marcia&mdash;she was trembling now&mdash;drank wine, and Pertinax
  began to pace the floor.</p>

  <p>"You, Galen, you had better go in to him," said Marcia.</p>

  <p>"If I do go, I must heal him," Galen answered.</p>

  <p>The groans in the bedroom ceased. The shouts began again&mdash;terrific
  imprecations&mdash;curses hurled at Marcia&mdash;the struggles of a
  strong man in the throes of cramp&mdash;and, at last, the sound of
  vomiting.</p>

  <p>"If he vomits he will not die!" Marcia exclaimed. Galen nodded. He
  appeared immensely satisfied&mdash;expectant.</p>

  <p>"Galen, have you&mdash;will that poison kill him?" Marcia demanded.</p>

  <p>"No," said Galen. "Pertinax must kill him. I promised I would do my best
  for Pertinax. Behold your opportunity!"</p>

  <p>Pertinax strode toward him, clutching at a dagger underneath his
  tunic.</p>

  <p>"Kill me if you wish," said Galen, "but if you have any resolution you had
  better do first what you wanted me to do. And you will need me
  afterward."</p>

  <p>Commodus was vomiting and in the pauses roaring like a mad beast. Marcia
  seized Pertinax by the arm. "I have done my part," she said. "Now nerve
  yourself! Go in now and finish it!"</p>

  <p>"He may die yet. Let us wait and see," said Pertinax.</p>

  <p>A howl rising to a scream&mdash;terror and anger mingled&mdash;came
  from the bedroom; then again the noise of vomiting and the creaking of the
  bed as Commodus writhed in the spasms of cramp.</p>

  <p>"He will feel better presently," said Galen.</p>

  <p>"If so, you die first! You have betrayed us all!" Pertinax shook off
  Marcia and scowled at Galen, raising his right arm as if about to strike the
  old man. "False to your emperor! False to us!"</p>

  <p>"And quite willing to die, if first I may see you play the man!" said
  Galen, blinking up at him.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" exclaimed Marcia. "Listen! Gods! He is up off the bed! He will be
  in here in a minute! Pertinax!"</p>

  <p>Alarm subsided. They could hear the thud and creak as Commodus threw
  himself back on the bed&mdash;then writhing again and groans of agony.
  Between the spasms Commodus began to frame connected sentences:</p>

  <p>"Guards! Your emperor is being murdered! Rescue your Commodus!"</p>

  <p>"He is recovering," said Galen.</p>

  <p>"Give me your dagger!" said Marcia and clutched at Pertinax' tunic,
  feeling for it.</p>

  <p>But she was not even strong enough to resist the half-contemptuous shrug
  with which Pertinax thrust her away.</p>

  <p>"You disgust me. There is neither dignity nor decency in this," he
  muttered. "Nothing but evil can come of it."</p>

  <p>"Whose was the star that fell?" asked Galen.</p>

  <p>There came more noise from the bedroom. Commodus seemed to be trying to
  get to his feet again. Marcia ran toward the smaller anteroom and dragged the
  curtains back.</p>

  <p>"Narcissus!"</p>

  <p>He came out, carrying Telamonion. The child lay asleep in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Go and put that child down. Now earn your freedom&mdash;go in and kill
  the emperor! He has poisoned himself, and he thinks we did it. Give him your
  dagger, Pertinax!"</p>

  <p>"I am only a slave," Narcissus answered. "It is not right that a slave
  should kill an emperor."</p>

  <p>Marcia seized the gladiator by the shoulders, scanned his face, saw what
  she looked for and bargained for it instantly.</p>

  <p>"Your freedom! Manumission* and a hundred thousand sesterces!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>manumission</i> (Latin)&mdash;the act of freeing
  a person from slavery. For historical background, see the article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manumission">Manumission</a> in
  <i>Wikipedia</i>. ]</p>

  <p>"In writing!" said Narcissus.</p>

  <p>"Dog!" growled Pertinax. "Go in and do as you are told!"</p>

  <p>But Narcissus only grinned at him and squared his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Death means little to a gladiator," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Leave him to me!" ordered Marcia.</p>

  <p>"Go and sit down at that table, Pertinax. Take pen and parchment. Now then
&mdash;what do you want in writing? Make haste!"</p>

  <p>"Freedom&mdash;you may keep your money&mdash;I shall not wait to
  receive it. Freedom for me and for Sextus and for all of Sextus' friends and
  freedmen. An order releasing Sextus from the guard-house instantly.
  Permission to leave Rome and Italy by any route we choose."</p>

  <p>"Write, Pertinax!" said Marcia. Narcissus glanced at Galen.</p>

  <p>"Galen," he said, "is one of Sextus' friends, so set his name down."</p>

  <p>"Never mind me," said Galen. "They will need me."</p>

  <p>Marcia stood over Pertinax, watching him write. She snatched the document
  and sanded it, then watched him write the order to the guard, releasing
  Sextus.</p>

  <p>"There!" she exclaimed. "You have your price. Go in and kill him! Give him
  your dagger, Pertinax."</p>

  <p>"I hoped for heroism, not expecting it," said Galen. "I expected cunning.
  Is it absent, too? If he should use a dagger&mdash;many men have heard me
  say that Caesar has a tendency to apoplexy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Strangle him!" commanded Marcia.</p>

  <p>She thrust the palms of her hands against Narcissus' back and pushed him
  toward the bedroom door, now almost at the end of her reserves of
  self-control. Her mouth trembled. She was fighting against hysteria.</p>

  <p>"Light! Lamp! Guards!" roared Commodus, and again the ebony-posted bed
  creaked under him. Narcissus stepped into the darkened room. He left the door
  open, to have light to do his work by, but Marcia closed it, clinging to the
  gilded satyr's head that served for knob with both hands, her lips drawn
  tight against her teeth, her whole face tortured with anticipation.</p>

  <p>"It is better that a gladiator did it," remarked Pertinax, attempting to
  look calm. "I never killed a man. As general, and as governor of Rome, as
  consul and proconsul, I have spared whom I might. Some had to die but&mdash;
  my own hands are clean."</p>

  <p>There came an awful sound of struggle from the inner room. A monstrous
  roar was shut off suddenly, half-finished, smothered under bedclothes. Then
  the bed-frame cracked under the strain of Titans fighting&mdash;cracked
&mdash;creaked&mdash;and utter silence fell. It lasted several minutes.
  Then the door opened and Narcissus came striding out.</p>

  <p>"He was strong," he remarked. "Look at this."</p>

  <p>He bared his arm and showed where Commodus had gripped him; the lithe
  muscle looked as if it had been gripped in an iron vise. He chafed it,
  wincing with pain.</p>

  <p>"Go in and observe that I have taken nothing. Don't be afraid," he added
  scornfully. "He fought like the god that he was, but he died&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of apoplexy," Galen interrupted. "That is to say, of a surging of blood
  to the brain and a cerebral rupture. It is fortunate you have a doctor on the
  scene who knew of his liability to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We must go and see," said Marcia. "Come with me, Pertinax. Then we must
  tidy the bed and make haste and summon the officers of the Praetorian Guard.
  Let them hear Galen say he died of apoplexy."</p>

  <p>She picked up a lamp from the table and Pertinax moved to follow her, but
  Narcissus stepped in his way.</p>

  <p>"Ave, Caesar!" he said, throwing up his right hand.</p>

  <p>"You may go," said Pertinax. "Go in silence. Not a word to a soul in the
  corridors. Leave Rome. Leave Italy. Take Sextus with you."</p>

  <p>"You will let him go?" asked Marcia. "Pertinax, what will become of you?
  Send to the guard at the gate and command them to seize him! Sextus and
  Narcissus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have my promise!" he retorted. "If the fates intend me to be Caesar, it
  shall not be said I slew the men who set me on the throne."</p>

  <p>"You are Caesar," she answered. "How long will you last? All omens favored
  you&mdash;the murder in the tunnel&mdash;now this storm, like a veil to
  act behind, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And last night a falling star!" said Galen. "Give me parchment. I will
  write the cause of death. Then let me go too, or else kill me. I am no more
  use. This is the second time that I have failed to serve the world by
  tutoring a Caesar. Commodus the hero, and now you the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" Marcia commanded. "Or even Pertinax may rise above his
  scruples! Write a death certificate at once, and go your way and follow
  Sextus!"</p>
