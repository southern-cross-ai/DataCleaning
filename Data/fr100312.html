  <h2><a name="chapA1"
     id="chapA1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A blood-red sun rested its huge disk upon a low mud wall
  that crested a rise to westward, and flattened at the bottom from its own
  weight apparently. A dozen dried-out false-acacia-trees shivered as the
  faintest puff in all the world of stifling wind moved through them; and a
  hundred thousand tiny squirrels kept up their aimless scampering in search of
  food that was not there.</p>

  <p>A coppersmith was about the only living thing that seemed to care whether
  the sun went down or not. He seemed in a hurry to get a job done, and his
  reiterated "Bong-bong-bong!"&mdash;that had never ceased since sunrise, and
  had driven nearly mad the few humans who were there to hear it&mdash;
  quickened and grew louder. At last Brown came out of a square mud house, to
  see about the sunset.</p>

  <p>He was nobody but plain Bill Brown&mdash;or Sergeant William Brown, to
  give him his full name and entitlements&mdash;and the price of him was two
  rupees per day.</p>

  <p>He stared straight at the dull red disk of the sun, and spat with
  eloquence. Then he wiped the sweat from his forehead, and scratched a place
  where the prickly heat was bothering him. Next, he buttoned up his tunic, and
  brushed it down neatly and precisely. There was official business to be done,
  and a man did that with due formality, heat or no heat.</p>

  <p>"Guard, turn out!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>Twelve men filed out, one behind the other, from the hut that he had left.
  They seemed to feel the heat more than Brown did, as they fell in line before
  Brown's sword. There was no flag, and no flag-pole in that nameless
  health-resort, so the sword, without its scabbard, was doing duty, point
  downward in the ground, as a totem-pole of Empire. Brown had stuck it there,
  like Boanerges' boots, and there it stayed from sunrise until sunset, to be
  displaced by whoever dared to do it, at his peril.</p>

  <p>They had no clock. They had nothing, except the uniforms and arms of the
  Honorable East India Company, as issued in this year of Our Lord, 1857
  &mdash;a cooking-pot or two, a kettle, a little money and a butcher-knife.
  Their supper bleated miserably some twenty yards away, tied to a tree, and a
  lean. Punjabi squatted near it in readiness to buy the skin. It was a big
  goat, but it was mangy, so he held only two annas in his hand. The other anna
  (in case that Brown should prove adamant) was twisted in the folds of his
  pugree, but he was prepared to perjure himself a dozen times, and take the
  names of all his female ancestors in vain, before he produced it.</p>

  <p>The sun flattened a little more at the bottom, and began to move quickly,
  as it does in India&mdash;anxious apparently to get away from the day's ill
  deeds.</p>

  <p>"Shoulder umms!" commanded Brown. "General salute! Present-umms!"</p>

  <p>The red sun slid below the sky-line, and the night was on them, as though
  somebody had shut the lid. Brown stepped to the sword, jerked it out of the
  ground and returned it to his scabbard in three motions.</p>

  <p>"Shoulder-umms! Order-umms! Dismiss!" The men filed back into the hut
  again, disconsolately, without swearing and without mirth. They had put the
  sun to bed with proper military decency. They would have seen humor&mdash;
  perhaps&mdash;or an excuse for blasphemy in the omission of such a detail,
  but it was much too hot to swear at the execution of it.</p>

  <p>Besides, Brown was a strange individual who detested swearing, and it was
  a very useful thing, and wise, to humor him. He had a way of his own, and
  usually got it.</p>

  <p>Brown posted a sentry at the hut-door, and another at the crossroads which
  he was to guard, then went round behind the but to bargain with the
  goatskin-merchant. But he stopped before he reached the tree.</p>

  <p>"Boy!" he called, and a low-caste native servant came toward him at a
  run.</p>

  <p>"Is that fakir there still?"</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Ha? Can't you learn to say 'yes,' like a human being?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"All right. I'm going to have a talk with him. Kill the goat, and tell the
  Punjabi to wait, if he wants to buy the skin."</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib!"</p>

  <p>Brown spun round on his heel, and the servant wilted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib!" he corrected.</p>

  <p>Brown left him then, with a nod that conveyed remission of cardinal sin,
  and a warning not to repeat the offence. As the native ran off to get the
  butcher-knife and sharpen it, it was noticeable that he wore a chastened
  look.</p>

  <p>"Send Sidiki after me!" Brown shouted after him, and a minute later a
  nearly naked Beluchi struck a match and emerged from the darkness, with the
  light of a lantern gleaming on his skin. He followed like a snake, and only
  Brown's sharp, authority-conveying footfalls could be heard as he trudged
  sturdily&mdash;straight-backed, eyes straight in front of him&mdash;to where
  an age-old baobab loomed like a phantom in the night. He marched like a man
  in armor. Not even the terrific heat of a Central-Indian night could take the
  stiffening out of him.</p>

  <p>The Beluchi ran ahead, just before they reached the tree. He stopped and
  held the lantern up to let its light fall on some object that was close
  against the tree-trunk. At a good ten-pace distance from the object Brown
  stopped and stared. The lamplight fell on two little dots that gleamed. Brown
  stepped two paces nearer. Two deadly, malicious human eyes blinked once, and
  then stared back at him.</p>

  <p>"Does he never sleep?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>The Beluchi said something or other in a language that was full of harsh
  hard gutturals, and the owner of the eyes chuckled. His voice seemed to be
  coming from the tree itself, and there was nothing of him visible except the
  cruel keen eyes that had not blinked once since Brown drew nearer.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he does not answer."</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'm tired of his not answering. Tell him that if he can't learn
  to give a civil answer to a civilly put question I'll exercise my authority
  on him!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated, or pretended to. Brown was not sure which, for he
  was rewarded with nothing but another chuckle, which sounded like water
  gurgling down a drain.</p>

  <p>"Does he still say nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely nothing, sahib."</p>

  <p>Brown stepped up closer yet, and peered into the blackness, looking
  straight into the eyes that glared at him, and from them down at the body of
  the owner of them. The Beluchi shrank away.</p>

  <p>"Have a care, sahib! It is dangerous! This very holy&mdash;most holy
  &mdash;most religious man!"</p>

  <p>"Bring that lantern back."</p>

  <p>"He will curse you, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Do you hear me?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi came nearer again, trembling with fright. Brown snatched the
  lamp away from him, and pushed it forward toward the fakir, moving it up and
  down to get a view of the whole of him. There was nothing that he saw that
  would reassure or comfort or please a devil even. It was ultradevilish; both
  by design and accident&mdash;conceived and calculated ghastliness, peculiar
  to India. Brown shuddered as he looked, and it took more than the merely
  horrible to make him betray emotion.</p>

  <p>"What god do you say he worships?"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I know not. I am a Mussulman. These Hindus worship many gods."</p>

  <p>The fakir chuckled again, and Brown held the lantern yet nearer to him to
  get a better view. The fakir's skin was not oily, and for all the
  blanket-heat it did not glisten, so his form was barely outlined against the
  blackness that was all but tangible behind him.</p>

  <p>Brown spat again, as he drew away a step. He could contrive to express
  more disgust and more grim determination in that one rudimentary act than
  even a Stamboul Softa can.</p>

  <p>"So he's holy, is he?"</p>

  <p>"Very, very holy, sahib!"</p>

  <p>Again the fakir chuckled, and again Brown held his breath and pushed the
  lantern closer to him.</p>

  <p>"I believe the brute understands the Queen's English!"</p>

  <p>"He understanding all things, sahib! He knowing all things what will
  happen! Mind, sahib! He may curse you!"</p>

  <p>But Brown appeared indifferent to the danger that he ran. To the fakir's
  unconcealed discomfort, he proceeded to examine him minutely, going over him
  with the aid of the lantern inch by inch, from the toe-nails upward.</p>

  <p>"Well," he commented aloud, "if the army's got an opposite, here's it! I'd
  give a month's pay for the privilege of washing this brute, just as a
  beginning!"</p>

  <p>The man's toe-nails&mdash;for he really was a man!&mdash;were at least two
  inches long. They were twisted spirally, and some of them were curled back on
  themselves into disgusting-looking knots. What walking he had ever done had
  been on his heels. His feet were bent upward, and fixed upward, by a
  deliberately cultivated cramp.</p>

  <p>His legs, twisted one above the other in a squatting attitude, were lean
  and hairy, and covered with open sores which were kept open by the swarm of
  insects that infested him. His loin-cloth was rotting from him. His emaciated
  body&mdash;powdered and smeared with ashes and dust and worse&mdash;was
  perched bolt-up-right on a flat earth dais that had once on a time been the
  throne of a crossroads idol. One arm, his right one, hung by his side in an
  almost normal attitude, and his right fingers moved incessantly like a man's
  who is kneading clay. But his other arm was rigid&mdash;straight up in the
  air above his head; set, fixed, cramped, paralyzed in that position, with the
  fist clenched. And through the back of the closed fist the fakir's nails were
  growing.</p>

  <p>But, worse than the horror of the arm was the creature's face, with the
  evidence of torture on it, and fiendish delight in torture for the torture's
  sake. His eyes were his only organs that really lived still, and they
  expressed the steely hate and cruelty, the mad fanaticism, the greedy
  self-love&mdash;self-immolating for the sake of self&mdash;that is the
  thoroughgoing fakir's stock in trade. And his lips were like the graven lips
  of a Hindu temple god, self-satisfied, self-worshiping, contemptuous and
  cruel. He chuckled again, as Brown finished his inspection.</p>

  <p>"So that crittur's holy, is he? Well, tell him that I'm set here to watch
  these crossroads. Tell him I'm supposed to question every one who comes, and
  find out what his business is, and arrest him if he can't give a proper
  account of himself. Say he's been here three days now, and that that's long
  enough for any one to find his tongue in. Tell him if I don't get an answer
  from him here and now I'll put him in the clink!"</p>

  <p>"But, sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You tell him what I say, d'you hear?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi made haste to translate, trembling as he spoke, and wilting
  visibly when the baleful eyes of the fakir rested on him for a second. The
  fakir answered something in a guttural undertone.</p>

  <p>"What does he say?"</p>

  <p>"That he will curse you, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Sentry!" shouted Brown.</p>

  <p>"Sir!" came the ready answer, and the sling-swivels of a rifle clicked as
  the man on guard at the crossroads shouldered it. There are some men who are
  called "sir" without any title to it, just as there are some sergeants who
  receive a colonel's share of deference when out on a non-commissioned
  officer's command. Bill Brown was one of them.</p>

  <p>"Come here, will you!"</p>

  <p>There came the sound of heavy footfalls, and a thud as a rifle-butt
  descended to the earth again. Brown moved the lamp, and its beams fell on a
  rifleman who stood close beside him at attention&mdash;like a jinnee formed
  suddenly from empty blackness.</p>

  <p>"Arrest this fakir. Cram him in the clink."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir!"</p>

  <p>The sentry took one step forward, with his fixed bayonet at the "charge,"
  and the fakir sat still and eyed him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, have a care, sahib!" wailed the Beluchi. "This is very holy man!"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" ordered Brown. "Here. Hold the lamp."</p>

  <p>The bayonet-point pressed against the fakir's ribs, and he drew back an
  inch or two to get away from it. He was evidently able to feel pain when it
  was inflicted by any other than himself.</p>

  <p>"Come on," growled the sentry. "Forward. Quick march. If you don't want
  two inches in you!"</p>

  <p>"Don't use the point!" commanded Brown. "You might do him an injury. Treat
  him to a sample of the butt!"</p>

  <p>The sentry swung his rifle round with an under-handed motion that all
  riflemen used to practise in the short-range-rifle days. The fakir winced,
  and gabbled something in a hurry to the man who held the lamp.</p>

  <p>"He says that he will speak, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Halt, then," commanded Brown. "Order arms. Tell him to hurry up!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated, and the fakir answered him, in a voice that
  sounded hard and distant and emotionless.</p>

  <p>"He says that he, too, is here to watch the crossroads, sahib! He says
  that he will curse you if you touch him!"</p>

  <p>"Tell him to curse away!"</p>

  <p>"He says not unless you touch him, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Prog him off his perch!" commanded Brown.</p>

  <p>The rifle leaped up at the word, and its butt landed neatly on the fakir's
  ribs, sending him reeling backward off his balance, but not upsetting him
  completely. He recovered his poise with quite astonishing activity, and
  shuffled himself back again to the center of the dais. His eyes blazed with
  hate and indignation, and his breath came now in sharp gasps that sounded
  like escaping steam. He needed no further invitation to commence his cursing.
  It burst out with a rush, and paused for better effect, and burst out again
  in a torrent. The Beluchi hid his face between his hands.</p>

  <p>"Now translate that!" commanded Brown, when the fakir stopped for lack of
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I dare not! Sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Brown took a threatening step toward him, and the Beluchi changed his
  mind. Brown's disciplining methods were a too recently encountered fact to be
  outdone by a fakir's promise of any kind of not-yet-met damnation.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he says that because your man has touched him, both you and your
  man shall lie within a week helpless upon an anthill, still living, while the
  ants run in and out among your wounds. He says that the ants shall eat your
  eyes, sahib, and that you shall cry for water, and there shall be no water
  within reach&mdash;only the sound of water just beyond you. He says that
  first you shall be beaten, both of you, until your backs and the soles of
  your feet run blood, in order that the ants may have an entrance!"</p>

  <p>"Is he going to do all this?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi passed the question on, and the fakir tossed him an answer to
  it.</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that the gods will see to it."</p>

  <p>"So the gods obey his orders, do they. Well, they've a queer sense of
  duty! What else does he prophesy?"</p>

  <p>"About your soul, sahib, and the sentry's soul."</p>

  <p>"That's interesting! Translate!"</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that for countless centuries you and your man shall
  inhabit the carcasses of snakes, to eat dirt and be trodden on and crushed,
  until you learn to have respect for very holy persons!"</p>

  <p>"Is he going to have the ordering of that?"</p>

  <p>"He says that the gods have already ordered it."</p>

  <p>"It won't make much difference, then, what I do now. If that's in store
  for me in any case, I may as well get my money's worth before the fun begins!
  Tell him that unless he can give me a satisfactory reason for being here I
  shall treat him to a little more rifle-butt, and something else afterward
  that he will like even less!"</p>

  <p>"He says," explained the Beluchi, after a moment's conversation with the
  fakir, "that he is here to see what the gods have prophesied. He says that
  India will presently be whelmed in blood!"</p>

  <p>"Whose blood?"</p>

  <p>"Yours and that of others. He says, did you not see the sunset?"</p>

  <p>"What of the sunset?"</p>

  <p>Brown looked about him and, save where the lantern cast a fitful light on
  the fakir and the sentry and the native servant, and threw into faint relief
  the shadowy, snake-like tendrils of the baobab, his eyes failed to pierce the
  gloom. The sunset was a memory. In that heavy, death-darkness silence it
  seemed almost as though there had never been a sun.</p>

  <p>"'A blot of blood,' he says. He says the order has been given. He says
  that half of India shall run blood within a day, and the whole of it within a
  week!"</p>

  <p>"Who gave the order?"</p>

  <p>"He answers 'Hookum hai!'&mdash;which means 'It is an order!' Nothing more
  does the holy fakir say."</p>

  <p>"To the clink with him!" commanded Brown. "I'm tired of these Old Mother
  Shipton babblings. That's the third useless Hindu fanatic within a week who
  has talked about India being drenched in blood. Let him go in to the depot
  under guard, and do his prophesying there! Bring him along."</p>

  <p>The sentry's rifle-butt rose again and threatened business. The Beluchi
  gave a warning cry, and the fakir tumbled off his dais. Then, with the
  trembling Beluchi walking on ahead with the lantern, and Brown and the sentry
  urging from behind, the fakir jumped and squirmed and wabbled on his all but
  useless feet toward the guardroom. When they reached the tree where the goat
  had bleated, the Punjabi skin-buyer rose up, took one long look at the fakir
  and ran.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be!" exclaimed the sentry.</p>

  <p>"You'll be worse than that," said Brown, "if you use that language
  anywhere where I'm about! I'll not have it, d'you hear? Get on ahead, and
  open the door of the clink!"</p>

  <p>The sentry obeyed him, and a moment later the fakir was thrust into a
  four-square mud-walled room, and the door was locked on him.</p>

  <p>"Back to your post," commanded Brown. "And next time I hear you swearing,
  I'll treat you to a double-trick, my man! About turn. Quick march."</p>

  <p>The sentry trudged off without daring to answer him, and Brown took a good
  look at the fakir through the iron bars that protected the top half of the
  door. Then he went off to see about his supper, of newly slaughtered
  goat-chops and chupatties baked in ghee. His soul revolted at the thought of
  it, but it was his duty to eat it and set an example to the men; and duty was
  the only thing that mattered in Bill Brown's scheme of things.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's true," he muttered, "and maybe it's all lies; there's no
  knowing. Maybe India's going to run blood, as these fakirs seem to think, and
  maybe it isn't. There'll be more blood shed than mine in that case! 'Hookum
  hai'&mdash;'It is orders,' heh ? Well&mdash;there's more than one sort of
  'Hookum hai!' I've got my orders too!"</p>

  <p>He doubled the guard, when supper bad been eaten and the guardroom had
  been swept and the pots and kettle had been burnished until they shone. Then
  he tossed a chupatty to the imprisoned fakir, spat again from sheer disgust,
  lit his pipe and went and sat where he could hear the footbeats of the
  sentries.</p>

  <p>"They can't help their religion," he muttered. "The poor infidels don't
  know no better. And they've got a right to think what they please 'about me
  or the Company. But I've no patience with uncleanliness! That's wrong any way
  you look at it. That critter can't see straight for the dirt on him, nor
  think straight for that matter. He's a disgrace to humanity. Priest or fakir
  or whatever he is, if I live to see tomorrow's sun I'll hand him over to the
  guard and have him washed!"</p>

  <p>Having formed that resolution, Brown dismissed all thoughts of the fakir.
  His memory went back to home&mdash;the clean white cottage on the Sussex
  Downs, and the clean white girl who once on a time had waited for him there.
  For the next few hours, until the guard was changed, the only signs or sounds
  of life were the glowing of Brown's pipe, the steady footfalls of the
  sentries and occasional creakings from the hell-hot guard-room, where
  sleepless soldiers tossed in prickly discomfort.</p>

  <h2><a name="chapA2"
     id="chapA2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bill Brown, with his twelve, had not been set to watch a
  lonely crossroad for the fun of it. One road was a well-made highway, and led
  from a walled city, where three thousand men sweated and thought of England,
  to another city, where five thousand armed natives drew England's pay, and
  wore English uniforms.</p>

  <p>The other road was a snake-like trail, nearly as wide but not nearly so
  well kept. It twisted here and there amid countless swarming native villages,
  and was used almost exclusively by natives, whose rightful business was
  neither war nor peace nor the contriving of either of them. It had been a
  trade-road when history was being born, and the laden ox-carts creaked along
  it still, as they had always done and always will do until India awakes.</p>

  <p>But there are few men in the world who attend to nothing but their
  rightful business, and there are even more in India than elsewhere who are
  prone to neglect their own affairs and stir up sedition among others. There
  are few fighting-men among that host. They are priests for the most part or
  fakirs or make-believe pedlers or confessed and shameless mendicants; and
  they have no liking for the trunk roads, where the tangible evidence of Might
  and Majesty may be seen marching in eight-hundred-man battalions. They prefer
  to dream along the byways, and set other people dreaming. They lead, when the
  crash comes, from behind.</p>

  <p>Though the men who made the policies of the Honorable East India Company
  were mostly blind to the moving finger on the wall, and chose to imagine
  themselves secure against a rising of the millions they controlled; and
  though most of their military officers were blinder yet, and failed to read
  the temper of the native troops in their immediate command, still, there were
  other men who found themselves groping, at least two years before the Mutiny
  of '57. They were groping for something intangible and noiseless and
  threatening which they felt was there in a darkness, but which one could not
  see.</p>

  <p>Baines was one of them&mdash;Lieutenant-General Baines, commanding at
  Bholat. His troops were in the center of a spider's web of roads that criss-
  crossed and drained a province. There were big trunk arteries, which took the
  flow of life from city to walled city, and a mass of winding veins in the
  shape of grass-grown country tracks. He could feel, if any man could, the
  first faint signs of fever rising, and he was placed where he could move
  swiftly, and cut deep in the right spot, should the knife be needed.</p>

  <p>He was like a surgeon, though, who holds a lancet and can use it, but who
  lacks permission. The poison in India's system lay deep, and the fever was
  slow in showing itself. And meanwhile the men who had the ordering of things
  could see neither necessity nor excuse for so much as a parade of strength.
  They refused, point-blank and absolutely, to admit that there was, or, could
  be, any symptom of unrest.</p>

  <p>He dared not make new posts for officers, for officers would grumble at
  enforced exile in the country districts, and the Government would get to hear
  of it, and countermand. But there were non-commissioned officers in plenty,
  and it was not difficult to choose the best of them&mdash;three men&mdash;
  and send them, with minute detachments, to three different points of vantage.
  Non-commissioned officers don't grumble, or if they do no one gets to hear of
  it, or minds. And they are just as good as officers at watching crossroads
  and reporting what they see and hear.</p>

  <p>So where a little cluster of mud huts ached in the heat of a right angle
  where the trunk road crossed a native road some seventy miles from Bholat,
  Bill Brown&mdash;swordsman and sergeant and strictest of martinets, as well
  as sentimentalist&mdash;had been set to watch and listen and report.</p>

  <p>There were many cleverer men in the non-commissioned ranks of Baine's
  command, many who knew more of the native languages, and who had more
  imagination. But there was none who knew better how to win the unqualified
  respect and the obedience of British and native alike, or who could be better
  counted on to obey an order, when it came, literally, promptly and in the
  teeth of anything.</p>

  <p>Brown's theories on religion were a thing to marvel at, and walk
  singularly wide of, for he was a preacher with a pair of fists when
  thoroughly aroused. And his devotion to a girl in England whom no one in his
  regiment had ever seen, and of whom he did not even possess a likeness, was
  next door to being pitiable. His voice was like a raven's, with something
  rather less than a raven's sense of melody; he was very prone to sing, and
  his songs were mournful ones. He was not a social acquisition in any
  generally accepted sense, although his language was completely free from
  blasphemy or coarseness. His ideas were too cut and dried to make
  conversation even interesting. But his loyalty and his sense of duty were as
  adamant.</p>

  <p>He had changed the double guard at the crossroads; and had posted two
  fresh men by the mud-walled guardroom door. He had lit his pipe for the
  dozenth time, and had let it go out again while he hummed a verse of a
  Covenanters' hymn. And he had just started up to wall over to the cell and
  make a cursory inspection of his prisoner, when his ears caught a distant
  sound that was different from any of the night sounds, though scarcely
  louder.</p>

  <p>Prompt as a rifle in answer to the trigger, he threw himself down on all
  fours, and laid his ear to the ground. A second later, he was on his feet
  again.</p>

  <p>"Guard!" he yelled. "Turn out!"</p>

  <p>Cots squeaked and jumped, and there came a rush of hurrying feet. The
  eight men not on watch ran out in single file, still buttoning their
  uniforms, and lined up beside the two who watched the guardroom door.</p>

  <p>"Stand easy!" commanded Brown. Then he marched off to the crossroads,
  finding his way in the blackness more by instinct and sense of direction than
  from any landmark, for even the road beneath his feet was barely visible.</p>

  <p>"D'you mean to tell me that neither of you men can hear that sound?" he
  asked the sentries.</p>

  <p>Both men listened intently, and presently one of them made out a very
  faint and distant noise, that did not seem to blend in with the other night-
  sounds.</p>

  <p>"Might be a native drum?" he hazarded.</p>

  <p>"No, 'tain't!" said the other. "I got it now. It's a horse galloping.
  Tired horse, by the sound of him, and coming this way. All right,
  Sergeant."</p>

  <p>"One of you go two hundred yards along the road, and form an advance-
  post, so to speak. Challenge him the minute he's within ear-shot, and shoot
  him if he won't halt. If he halts, pass him along to Number Two. Number Two,
  pass him along to the guardroom, where I'll deal with him! Which of you's
  Number One? Number One, then&mdash;forward&mdash;quick&mdash; march!"</p>

  <p>The sentry trudged off in one direction, and Bill Brown in another. The
  sentry concealed itself behind a rock that flanked the road, and Brown spent
  the next few minutes in making the guard "port arms," and carefully
  inspecting their weapons with the aid of a lantern. He had already inspected
  there once since supper, but he knew the effect that another inspection would
  be likely to produce. Nothing goes further toward making men careful and
  ready at the word than incessant and unexpected but quite quietly performed
  inspection of minutest details.</p>

  <p>He produced the effect of setting the men on the qui vive without alarming
  them.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the farthest advanced sentry's challenge rang out.</p>

  <p>"Frie-e-e-e-nd!" came the answer, in nasal, high-pitched wail, but the
  galloping continued.</p>

  <p>"Halt, I tell you!" A breech-bolt clicked, and then another one. They were
  little sounds, but they were different, and the guard could hear them
  plainly. The galloping horse came on.</p>

  <p>"Cra-a-a-a-ack!" went the sentry's rifle, and the flash of it spurted for
  an instant across the road, like a sheet of lightning. And, just as lightning
  might, it showed an instantaneous vision of a tired gray horse, foam-flecked
  and furiously ridden, pounding down the road head-on. The vision was blotted
  by the night again before any one could see who rode the horse, or what his
  weapons were&mdash;if any&mdash;or form a theory as to why he rode.</p>

  <p>But the winging bullet did what the sentry's voice had failed to do. There
  came a clatter of spasmodic hoof-beats, an erratic shower of sparks, a curse
  in clean-lipped decent Urdu; a grunt, a struggle, more sparks again, and then
  a thud, followed by a devoutly worded prayer that Allah, the all-wise
  provider of just penalties, might blast the universe.</p>

  <p>"Stop talkin'!" said the sentry, and a black-bearded Rajput rolled free,
  and looked up to find a bayonet-point within three inches of his eye.</p>

  <p>"Poggul!" snarled the Mohammedan.</p>

  <p>"Poggul's no password!" said the sentry. "Neither to my good-nature nor to
  nothing else. Put up your 'ands, and get on your feet, and march! Look alive,
  now! Call me a fool, would yer? Wait till the sergeant's through with yer,
  and see!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput chose to consider a retort beneath his dignity. He rose, and
  took one quick look at the horse, which was still breathing.</p>

  <p>"Your bayonet just there," he said, "and press. So he will die
  quickly."</p>

  <p>The sentry placed his bayonet-point exactly where directed, and leaned his
  weight above it. The horse gave a little shudder, and lay still.</p>

  <p>"Poggul!" said the Rajput once again. And this time the sentry looked and
  saw cold steel within three inches of his eye!</p>

  <p>"Your rifle!" said the Rajput. "Hand it here!"</p>

  <p>And, to save his eyesight, the sentry complied, while the Rajput's ivory-
  white teeth grinned at him pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Now, hands to your sides! Attention! March!" the Rajput ordered, and with
  his own bayonet at his back the sentry had to march, whether he wanted to or
  not, by the route that the other chose, toward the guardroom. The Rajput
  seemed to know by instinct where the second sentry stood although the man's
  shape was quite invisible against the night. He called out, "Friend!" again
  as he passed him, and the sentry hearing the first sentry's footsteps,
  imagined that the real situation was reversed.</p>

  <p>So, out of a pall of blackness, to the accompanying sound of rifles being
  brought up to the shoulder, a British sentry&mdash;feeling and looking
  precisely like a fool&mdash;marched up to his own guardroom, with a man who
  should have been his prisoner in charge of him.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" commanded Brown. "Who or what have you got there, Stanley?"</p>

  <p>"Stanley is my prisoner at present!" said a voice that Brown vaguely
  recognized.</p>

  <p>He stepped up closer, to make sure.</p>

  <p>"What, you? Juggut Khan!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Brown sahib! Juggut Khan&mdash;with tidings, and a dead gray horse
  on which to bear them! If this fool could only use his bayonet as he can
  shoot, I think I would be dead too. His brains, though, are all behind his
  right eye. Tie him up, where no little child can come and make him
  prisoner!"</p>

  <p>"Arrest that man!" commanded Brown, and two men detached themselves from
  the end of the guard, and stood him between them, behind the line.</p>

  <p>"Here's his rifle!" smiled Juggut Khan, and Brown received it with an ill
  grace.</p>

  <p>"How did you get past the other sentry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, easily! You English are only brave; you have no brains. Sometimes one
  part of the rule is broken, but the other never. You are not always
  brave!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're angry because he killed your horse?"</p>

  <p>"I am angry, Brown sahib, for greater happenings than that! The man
  conceivably was right, since I did not halt for him, and I suppose he had his
  orders. I am angry because the standard of rebellion is raised, and because
  of what it means to me!"</p>

  <p>"Are you drunk, Juggut Khan?"</p>

  <p>"Your honor is pleased to be humorous? No, I am not drunk. Nor have I
  eaten opium. I have eaten of the bread of bitterness this day, and drunk of
  the cup of gall. I have seen British officers&mdash;good, brave fools, some
  of whom I knew and loved&mdash;killed by the men they were supposed to lead.
  I have seen a barracks burning, and a city given over to be looted. I have
  seen white women&mdash;nay, sahib, steady!&mdash;I have seen them run before
  a howling mob, and I have seen certain of them shot by their own
  husbands!"</p>

  <p>"Quietly!" ordered Brown. "Don't let the men hear!"</p>

  <p>"One of them I slew myself, because her husband, who was wounded, sent me
  to her and bade me kill her. She died bravely. And certain others I have
  hidden where the mutineers are not likely to discover them at present. I ride
  now for succor&mdash;or, I rode, rather, until your expert marksman
  interfered with me! I now need another horse."</p>

  <p>"You mean that the native troops have mutinied?" "I mean rather more than
  that, sahib. Mohammedans and Hindus are as one, and the crowd is with them.
  This is probably the end of the powder-train, for, from what I heard shouted
  by the mutineers, almost the whole of India is in revolt already!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"God knows, sahib! The reason given is that the cartridges supplied are
  greased with the blended fat of pigs and cows, thus defiling both Hindu and
  Mohammedan alike. But, if you ask me, the cause lies deeper. In the meantime,
  the rebels have looted Jailpore and burned their barracks, and within an hour
  or two they will start along this road for Bholat, which they have a mind to
  loot likewise. My advice to you is retire at once. Get me another horse from
  somewhere, that I may carry warning. Then follow me as fast as you and your
  men can move."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said Brown. "They'll find General Baines to deal with them at
  Bholat."</p>

  <p>"Who knows yet how many in Bholat have not risen? Are you positive that
  the garrison there has not already been surrounded by rebels? I am not! I
  would not be at all surprised to learn that General Baines is so busy
  defending himself that he can not move in any direction. And&mdash;does your
  honor mean to hold this guardroom here against five thousand?"</p>

  <p>"I mean to obey my orders!" answered Brown.</p>

  <p>"And your orders are?"</p>

  <p>"My orders!"</p>

  <p>"Would they preclude the provision of another horse for me?"</p>

  <p>"There's a village about a mile away, down over yonder, where I think
  you'll find a decent horse&mdash;along that road there."</p>

  <p>"And your honor's orders would possibly permit a certain payment for the
  horse?"</p>

  <p>"Positively not!" said Brown.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"To seize a horse, for military use, under the spur of necessity, and
  after giving a receipt for it, would be in order."</p>

  <p>"So I am to spend the night wandering around the countryside, in a vain
  endeavor to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Brown was doing mathematics in his head. Two men to guard prisoners,
  two on guard at the crossroads, two at the guardroom door&mdash;six from
  twelve left six, and six were not enough to rape a countryside.</p>

  <p>"Guard!" he ordered. "Release that prisoner. Now, you Stanley, let this be
  a lesson to you, and remember that I only set you free because I'd have been
  short-handed otherwise. Number One! Stand guard between the clink and the
  guardroom door. Keep an eye on both. The remainder&mdash;form two-deep. Right
  turn! By the left, quick-march! Left wheel!..... Now," he said, turning to
  Juggut Khan, "if you'll come along I'll soon get a horse for you!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput strode along beside him, and gave him some additional
  information as they went, Brown taking very good care all the time to keep
  out of earshot of the men and to speak to Juggut Khan in low tones. He
  learned, among other things, that Juggut Khan had lost every anna that he
  owned, and had only escaped with his life by dint of luck and swordship and
  most terrific riding.</p>

  <p>"Are all of you Rajputs loyal?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>"I know not. I know that I myself shall stay loyal until the end!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the end is not in doubt. There can only be one end!" commented
  Brown.</p>

  <p>"Of a truth, sahib, I believe that you are right. There can only be one
  end. This night is not more black, this horizon is no shorter, than the
  outlook!"</p>

  <p>"Then, you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean, sahib, that this uprising is more serious than you&mdash;or any
  other Englishman&mdash;is likely to believe. I believe that the side I fight
  for will be the losing side."</p>

  <p>"And yet, you stay loyal?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"All the same, Juggut Khan&mdash;I'm not emotional, or a man of many
  words. I don't trust Indians as a rule! I&mdash;but&mdash;here&mdash; will
  you shake hands?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sahib!" said the Rajput. "We be two men, you and I! Why should
  the one be loyal and the other not?"</p>

  <p>"When this is over," said Brown, "if it ends the way we want, and we're
  both alive, I'd like to call myself your friend!"</p>

  <p>"I have always been your friend, sahib, and you mine, since the day when
  you bandaged up a boy and gave him your own drinking-water and carried him in
  to Bholat on your shoulder, twenty miles or more."</p>

  <p>"Oh, as for that&mdash;any other man would have done the same thing. That
  was nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Strange that when a white man does an honorable deed he lies about it!"
  said Juggut Khan. "That was not nothing, sahib, and you know it was not
  nothing! You know that from the heat and the exertion you were ill for more
  than a month afterward. And you know that there were others there, of my own
  people, who might have done what you did, and did not!"</p>

  <p>"But, hang it all! Why drag up a little thing like this?"</p>

  <p>"Because, sahib, I might have no other opportunity, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well? And what?"</p>

  <p>"And the Rajput boy whom you carried was my son!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapA3"
     id="chapA3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The finding of a remount for Juggut Khan was not so
  troublesome as might have been supposed. The rumors and plans and whispered
  orders for the coming struggle had been passed around the countryside for
  months past, and every man who owned a horse had it stalled safely near him,
  for use when the hour should come.</p>

  <p>There were country-ponies and Arabs and Kathiawaris and Khaubulis among
  which to pick, and though the average run of them was worse than merely bad,
  and though both best and worst were hidden away whenever possible, good
  horses were discoverable. Within an hour, Bill Brown; with the aid of his
  men, had routed out a Khaubuji stallion for Juggut Khan, one fit to carry him
  against time the whole of the way to Bholat.</p>

  <p>The Rajput mounted him where Brown unearthed him, and watched the signing
  of a scribbled-out receipt with a cynical smile.</p>

  <p>"If he comes to claim his money for the horse," said Juggut Khan, "I
  &mdash;even I, who am penniless&mdash;will pay him. Good-by, Brown sahib!" He
  leaned over and grasped the sergeant by the hand. "Take my advice, now. I
  know what is happening and what has happened. Fall back on Bholat at once.
  Hurry! Seize horses or even asses for your men, and ride in hotfoot.
  Salaam!"</p>

  <p>He drove his right spur in, wheeled the horse and started across country
  in the direction of Bholat at a hand-gallop, guiding himself solely by the
  soldier's sixth sense of direction, and leaving the problem of possible
  pitfalls to the horse.</p>

  <p>"If what he says is true," said Brown, as the clattering hoof-beats died
  away, "and I'm game to take my oath he wouldn't lie to me, I'd give more than
  a little to have him with me for the next few hours!"</p>

  <p>The men came clustering round him now, anxious for an explanation. They
  had held their tongues while Juggut Khan was there, because they happened to
  know Brown too well to do otherwise. He would have snubbed any man who dared
  to question him before the Indian. But, now that the Indian was gone,
  curiosity could stay no longer within bounds.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Sergeant? Anything been happening? What's the news? What's
  that I heard him say about rebellion? They're a rum lot, them Rajputs. D'you
  think he's square? Tell us, Sergeant!"</p>

  <p>"Listen, then. Rebellion has broken out. The native barracks at Jailpore
  have been burned, and all the English officers are killed&mdash;or so says
  Juggut Khan. He's riding on, to carry the news to General Baines. He says
  that the mutineers are planning to come along this way some time within the
  next few hours!"</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do, then?"</p>

  <p>"That's my business! I'm in command here!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but, Sergeant&mdash;aren't you going back to Bholat? Aren't you
  going to follow him? Are you going to stay here and get cut up? We'll get
  caught here like rats in a trap!"</p>

  <p>"Are you giving orders here?" asked Brown acidly. "Fall in! Come on, now!
  Hurry! 'Tshun&mdash;eyes right&mdash;ri'&mdash;dress. Eyes&mdash; front.
  Ri'&mdash;turn. By the left&mdash;quick&mdash;march! Silence, now! Left!
  Left! Left!"</p>

  <p>He marched them back toward the crossroads without giving them any further
  opportunity to remonstrate or ask for information.</p>

  <p>It was not until he reached the crossroads, without being challenged, that
  he showed any sign of being in any way disturbed.</p>

  <p>"Sentry!" he shouted. "Sentry!"</p>

  <p>But there was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" he ordered, and he himself went forward to investigate. The
  blackness swallowed him, but the men could hear him move, and they heard him
  fall. They heard him muttering, too, within ten paces of them. Then they
  heard his order.</p>

  <p>"Bring a light here, some one."</p>

  <p>One man produced a piece of candle, struck a match and lit it. A moment
  later they had all broken order, and were standing huddled up together like a
  frightened flock of sheep, peering through dancing, candle-lit shadows at
  something horrible that Brown was handling.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"What in hell's happened?"</p>

  <p>"Who was that swearing?" inquired Brown, with a sudden look up across his
  shoulder. "You, Taylor? You again? Swearing in the presence of death? Talking
  of hell, with your two comrades lying dead at the crossroads, and you like to
  follow both o' them at any minute?"</p>

  <p>Both of the guards lay dead. They lay quite neatly, side by side, without
  a sign about them to show that they had met with violence. Brown rolled one
  body over, though, and then the cause of death became more obvious. A stream
  of blood welled out of the man's back, from between the shoulder-blades
  &mdash;warm blood, that had not even started to coagulate.</p>

  <p>"They've been dead about three minutes!" commented Brown, rising, and
  wiping his hands in the road-dust to get the blood off them. "Pick 'em up.
  Carefully, now! Frog-march 'em, face-downwards. That's better! Now, forward.
  Quick, march!"</p>

  <p>The procession advanced toward the guardhouse in grim silence, and once
  again there was no challenge when there should have been. The lamp was still
  burning in the guardroom, for they could see it plainly as they drew nearer,
  but there was no noise of a sentry's footfalls, or hoarse "Halt!" and "Who
  comes there?"</p>

  <p>Nor was there any sign yet of the man whom Brown had left to guard both
  "clink" and guardroom. Brown let them take their dead comrades into the
  guardroom first, then set two fresh guards at the door, and covered up the
  bodies with a sheet before commencing to investigate.</p>

  <p>He started off toward the cell where he had imprisoned the fakir. He went
  by himself, and no one volunteered to go with him.</p>

  <p>He had gone five yards when the second explanation met his eyes. This time
  there was no need to stoop down, nor to turn any body over. The sentry whom
  he had left to guard both cell and guardroom stood bolt upright, with his
  mouth and his eyes wide open; skewered to the wall of the guardhouse by an
  iron spike, which pierced his chest.</p>

  <p>"A lamp and four men here!" ordered Brown, without waiting to let the
  horror of the sight sink in. "Take that poor chap down, and lay him in the
  guardroom beside the others. How? How should I know? Pull it out, or break it
  off&mdash;I don't care which; don't leave him there, that's all."</p>

  <p>He walked on toward the cell-door, while they labored, and fingered
  gingerly around the spike, which must have been driven through the sentry's
  chest with a hammer.</p>

  <p>"I thought as much!" he muttered. And, though be had not thought as much,
  he might have done so. "I knew that a man who could maim his own body in that
  way was capable of any crime in the calendar!"</p>

  <p>The door of the cell stood open, and there was no sign of any fakir, or of
  any one who might have helped him go&mdash;nothing but an empty cell, with
  the haunting smell of the fakir still abiding in it.</p>

  <p>Bill Brown spat, and closed the cell-door.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking that Juggut Khan told nothing but the truth," he muttered.
  "Things look right, don't they, if that's so! Obey, Obey! I'd have liked to
  see England just once again&mdash;I would indeed. If I could only see her
  just once. If I'd a letter from her, or her picture. This is a rotten,
  rat-in-a-hole, lonely, uncreditable way to die! I wish Juggut Khan were here.
  I'd have somebody to help me keep my good courage up in that case."</p>

  <p>The lock on the cell-door was broken, so he only closed it, then started
  back toward the guardroom.</p>

  <p>"Three rifles, and three ammunition pouches gone!" he muttered. "That's
  three weapons they've got, in any case. A hornet's nest'd be better stopping
  in than this place."</p>

  <p>He overtook the men who were carrying in the nail-killed sentry, and he
  saw that their faces were drawn and white. So were those of the other men,
  who were clustered in the guardroom door.</p>

  <p>"What next, Sergeant? Hadn't we better be quick? Why not burn the place?
  That'd do instead o' buryin' the dead ones, and it'd give us a light to get
  away by. Might serve as a beacon, too. Might fetch assistance!"</p>

  <p>It was evident that panic had set in.</p>

  <p>"Fall in!" commanded Brown, and his straight back took on a curve that
  meant straightness to the nth power.</p>

  <p>"'Tshun! Ri'&mdash;dress! Eyes&mdash;front!"</p>

  <p>He glared at them for just about one minute before he spoke, and during
  that minute each man there realized that what was coming would be quite
  irrevocable.</p>

  <p>"I'm sergeant here. My orders are to hold this post until relieved.
  Therefore&mdash;and I hope there's no man here holds any other notion; I hope
  it for his own sake!&mdash;until we are relieved, we're going to hold it!
  Moreover, this command is going to be a real command, from now on. It's going
  to buck up. I'm going to put some ginger in it. There are three dead men here
  to be avenged, and I'm going to avenge 'em, or make you do it! And if any man
  imagines he's going to help himself by feeling afraid, let me assure him that
  the only thing he needs to fear is me! I've a right to command men&mdash;I
  know how&mdash;I intend to do it. And if I've got to make men first out of
  whey-faced cowards, why, I'm game to do it, and this is just where I begin!
  Now! Anybody got a word to say?"</p>

  <p>There was grim silence.</p>

  <p>"Good! I'll assume, then, until I'm contradicted, that you're all brave
  men. Into the guardroom with you!"</p>

  <p>"Sahib! Sahib!" said a voice beside him.</p>

  <p>"Well? What?"</p>

  <p>It was the Beluchi interpreter who had carried the lamp for him that
  evening when he arrested the fakir.</p>

  <p>"Run, sahib! It is time to run away!"</p>

  <p>"Go on, then! Why don't you run?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of the men who slew the soldiers. Sahib! Remember what the fakir said.
  You will be pegged out on an anthill, sahib, when you have been beaten. Run,
  while there is yet time!"</p>

  <p>"Did you see them kill my men?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"How was that?"</p>

  <p>"I ran away and hid, sahib."</p>

  <p>"How many were there?"</p>

  <p>"Very many. The Punjabi skin-buyer brought them."</p>

  <p>"He did, did he? Very well! Did he go off with the fakir?"</p>

  <p>"I think he did. I did not see."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll suppose he did, then. And when the day breaks; we'll suppose
  that we can find him, and we'll go in search of him, and I wouldn't like to
  be that Punjabi when I do find him! Get into the guard-room, and wait in
  there until I give you leave to stir."</p>

  <h2><a name="chapA4"
     id="chapA4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

  <p class="first">An Indian city that has yet to have its mysterie's laid bare
  and banished by electric light is a stage deliberately set for massacre. The
  bazaars run criss-crosswise; any way at all save parallel, and anyhow but
  straight. Between them lies always a maze of passages, and alleys, deep
  sided, narrow, overhung by trellised windows and loopholed walls and guarded
  stairways.</p>

  <p>For every square inch where the sun can shine there are a hundred where a
  man could hide unseen. Through century piled on suspicious century, no
  designer, no architect, no builder has neglected to provide a means of secret
  ingress, and still more secret egress, to each new house. And the newest
  house is built on secret passages that hid conspirators against the kings of
  men who lived before the oldest house was thought of.</p>

  <p>After the Mutiny of '57 came broader roads&mdash;so that a cannon might be
  trained along them.</p>

  <p>But in '57, Jailpore was a nest of winding alley-ways and blind bat and
  rat holes, where weird smells and strange unlisted poisons and prophecies
  were born. In its midst, tight-packed in a roaring babel-din of many-colored
  markets, stood a stone-walled palace, built once by a Hindu king to
  commemorate a victory over Moslems, added to by a Moslem Nizam, to celebrate
  his conquest of the Hindus and added to once again by the Honorable East
  India Company, to make a suitable barracks for its native troops.</p>

  <p>From the rat-infested slums, from the hot shadows and the mazy back-
  bazaars, from temples, store-houses, shops, and from the sin-steeped
  underworld, there screamed and surged and swept the many-graded, many-minded
  polyglot rebellion-spume. A quarter of a million underdogs had turned against
  their masters. A hundred factions and as many more religions, all had one
  common end in view&mdash;to loot. All were agreed on one thing&mdash;that the
  first stage of the game must be to turn Jailpore and, after Jailpore, India,
  into a charnel-house.</p>

  <p>Around and around the burning palace the mob screamed and swept
  uncontrolled. Moslem looted Hindu, and Hindu Moslem. Armed sepoys, with the
  blood of their British officers fresh-soaked on their British uniforms, and
  the unspent pay of "John Company" still jingling in their pockets, danced
  weird, wild devil-dances through the streets, clearing their way, when they
  saw fit, with cold steel or wanton volleys. Women screamed. Caste looted
  caste. Loose horses galloped madly through the streets. Here and there a
  pitched battle raged, where a merchant who had wealth had also courage, and
  apprentices and friends to help him defend his store.</p>

  <p>And through all the din and clamor, under and above the howling and the
  volleys and the roar of flames, sounded the steady thumping of the sacred
  war-drums. The whole sky glowed red. The Indian night was scorched and smoked
  and lit by arson. Hell screamed with the cooking of red mutiny, and throbbed
  with the thunder of the sacred temple-drums. And that was only one of the
  hells, and a small one. India glowed red that night from end to end!</p>

  <p>Juggut Khan, free-lance Rajput and gentleman of fortune, had ridden out of
  that caldron of Jailpore. His house was a heap of glowing ashes, and his
  goods were tossed for and distributed among a company. But his mark lay
  indelibly impressed upon the town. There were three European women and a
  child who were nowhere to be found; and there was a trail that led from
  somewhere near the palace to the western gate. It was a red trail.</p>

  <p>In one spot lay a sepoy pierced through by a lance, and with half of the
  lance-shaft still standing upright in him. That had been bad art&mdash; sheer
  playing to the gallery! Juggut Khan had run him through and tried to lift him
  on the lance-end for a trophy. It was luck that saved the day for him that
  time, not swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>But a man who has done what he had done that day may be forgiven. There
  lay nine other men behind him where his lance was left, and each of them lay
  face upward with a round red hole in his anatomy where the lance had
  entered.</p>

  <p>And from the point where he had broken his lance and left it, up to where
  a self-appointed guard had refused at first to open the city gate for him,
  there was a trail that did honor to the man who taught him swordsmanship. One
  man lay headless, and another's head was only part of him, because the sword
  had split it down the middle and the two halves were still joined together at
  the neck.</p>

  <p>There were men who claimed afterward that of the twenty-three who lay
  between his lance-shaft and the city gate, some five or six had been slain in
  brawls and looting forays. And Juggut Khan was never known to discuss the
  matter. But the fact remains that every man of them was killed by the blade
  or point of a cavalry-saber, and that Juggut Khan broke out of the place
  untouched.</p>

  <p>And another fact worthy of record is, that underneath a stone floor, in a
  building that was partly powder-magazine-surrounded at every end and side by
  mutineers who searched for them, and very nearly stifled by the dust of
  decaying ages&mdash;there lay three women and a child, with a jar of water
  close beside them and a sack of hastily collected things to eat. They lay
  there in all but furnace-heat, close-huddled in the darkness, and they
  shuddered and sobbed and blessed Juggut Khan alternately. Below them the
  whispering echoes sighed mysteriously through a maze of tunnels. Around them,
  and around their sack of food, the rats scampered. Above them, where a
  ten-ton stone trapdoor lay closed over their heads, black powder stood in
  heaps and sacks and barrels. Closing the trapdoor had been easy. One pushed
  it and it fell. Not all the mutineers in Jailpore nor Juggut Khan nor any one
  could open it again without the secret. And no man living knew the secret.
  The three women and the child were safe from immediate intrusion!</p>

  <p>Those three women and that child were not so exceptionally placed for
  India, of that date. Two of the women had seen their husbands slain that
  afternoon, before their eyes. They were mother and daughter and grandson; and
  the fourth was an English nurse, red-cheeked still from the kiss of English
  Channel breezes.</p>

  <p>"If only Bill were here!" the nurse wailed. "I know he'd find a way out.
  There wasn't never nothing nowhere that beat Bill. Bill wouldn't ha' left us!
  Bill'd ha' took us out o' here, an' saved our lives. Bill&mdash;snnff,
  snnff&mdash;Bill wouldn't ha'&mdash;snnff, snnff&mdash;shoved us in a
  rat-hole and took hisself off!"</p>

  <p>She had not yet lost her English point of view. She still believed that
  the strong right arm of an English lover could play ducks and drakes with
  Destiny. One-half of the world, at least, still swears that she was wrong,
  and her mistress and the other woman thought her despicable, ridiculous,
  unenlightened. It was a hardship to them, to be endured with dignity and
  patience, but none the less a hardship, that they should be left and should
  have to die with this woman of the Ranks Below to keep them company. She was
  an honest woman, or they would never have engaged her and paid her passage
  all the way to India. But she was not of their jat, and she was a fool. It
  happens, however, that her point of view saved England for the English, and
  that the other point of view had brought England to the brink of utter
  ruin.</p>

  <p>"If you'd leave off talking about your truly tiresome lover, and would
  pray to God, Jane," said Mrs. Leslie, "the rest of us might have a chance to
  pray to God too! This isn't the time, let me tell you, to be thinking of
  carnal love-affairs. Recall your sins, one by one, and ask forgiveness for
  them."</p>

  <p>In the gloom of the vault, poor Jane was quite invisible. The sound of her
  snuffling and sobs was the only clue to her direction. But her bridling was a
  thing that could be felt through the stuffy blackness, and there was a ring
  in her retort that gave the lie to the tears that she was shedding.</p>

  <p>"The only sin I ask forgiveness for," she answered in a level voice, "is
  having let Bill come to India alone. Pray to God, is it? Go on! Pray! If Bill
  was here, he'd start on that stone door without no words nor argument, unless
  some one tried to stop him. Then there'd be an argument! And he'd get it open
  too. Bill's the kind that does his prayin' afterward, and God helps men like
  Bill!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm afraid that your Bill isn't here, and can't get here. So
  the best thing that you can do is to pray and let us pray."</p>

  <p>"I'll pray for Bill!" said Jane defiantly. "Bill don't know that I'm in
  India, and he surely doesn't know I'm here. But if he knew&mdash;Oh, God! Let
  him know! Tell him! He'd come so quick. He'd&mdash;snnff, snnff&mdash;
  he'd&mdash;why, he'd ha' been here long ago! Dear God, tell Bill I'm here,
  that's all!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chapA5"
     id="chapA5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p class="first">General Baines was in a position to be envied. No soldier
  worthy of his salt is other than elated at the thought of war. Now for the
  proving of his theories. Now for the fruit of all his tireless preaching and
  inspection and preparing&mdash;the planned, pegged-out swoop to victory!</p>

  <p>He knew&mdash;as few men in India knew&mdash;the length and the breadth of
  what was coming. And when two of his non-commissioned officers sent in word
  that the whole country was ablaze, he realized, as few other men did in that
  minute, that this was no local outbreak. The long-threatened holocaust had
  come, and he had to act, to smite, to strike sure and swift at the festering
  root of things, or Central India was lost.</p>

  <p>But his hands were tied still. He knew. He could see. He could feel. He
  could hear. But he had his orders. That very morning they had been repeated
  to him, and with emphasis. In a letter from the Council he had been told that
  "slight disturbances, of a purely local character, were not without the
  bounds of possibility, due partly to religious unrest and partly to local
  causes. Under no circumstances were any extended reprisals to be undertaken
  until further orders, and generals commanding districts were required to keep
  the bulk of their commands within cantonments."</p>

  <p>The countryside was up. All India probably was up. His own men, set by
  himself to watch with one definite idea, had confirmed his worst fears. And
  he was under orders to stay with the bulk of his command in Bholat! Corked up
  in cantonments, with three thousand first-class fighting-men squealing for
  trouble, and red rebellion running riot all around him though it might be
  quelled by instant action!</p>

  <p>And then worse happened. Juggut Khan clattered in to Bholat, spurring a
  horse that was so spent it could barely keep its feet. It fell in a woeful
  heap outside the general's quarters, and Juggut Khan&mdash;all but as weary
  as the horse&mdash;swung himself free, staggered past the sentry at the door
  and rapped with his hilt on the tough teak panel. They had to give him brandy
  and feed him before he could summon strength enough to tell what he had seen
  and heard and done.</p>

  <p>"And Brown stayed on at the crossroads?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, General sahib! He stayed!"</p>

  <p>The general sat back and drummed his heels together on the floor in a way
  that his aides had come to recognize as meaning trouble.</p>

  <p>"You say that all of the European officers in Jailpore have been
  killed?"</p>

  <p>"I did not count. I did not even know them all by mine or sight. I think,
  though, that all were killed. I heard men among the mutineers declare that
  all had been accounted for, save only three women and a child, and me. Those
  four I myself had hidden, and as for myself&mdash;I too was accounted for,
  and not without credit to the Raj for whom I fight!"</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Juggut Khan! Did you have to cut your way out?"</p>

  <p>The Rajput smiled.</p>

  <p>"There was a message to deliver, sahib! What would you? Should I have
  waited while they arrested me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! You managed to evade them, did you?"</p>

  <p>"At least I am here, sahib!"</p>

  <p>The general chewed at his mustache, leaned his chair back against the wall
  and tapped at his boot with a riding-cane.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Juggut Khan," he said after another minute's thought, "what is
  your idea? Is this sporadic? Is this a local outbreak? Will this die down, if
  left to burn itself out?"</p>

  <p>The Rajput laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"'Sporadic,"' he answered, "is a word of which I have yet to learn the
  meaning. If 'sporadic' means rebellion from Peshawur to Cape Cormorin&mdash;
  revolution, rape, massacre, arson, high treason, torture, death to every
  European and every half-breed and every loyal native north, south, east and
  west&mdash;then, yes, General sahib, 'sporadic' would be the proper word. If
  your Honor should mean less than that, then some other word is needed!"</p>

  <p>"Then you confirm my own opinion. You are inclined to think that this is
  an organized and country-wide rebellion?"</p>

  <p>"I know of what I speak, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"You don't think that you are being influenced in your opinion by the fact
  that you have seen a massacre, and have lost everything you had?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! This is no hour for joking, or for bearing of false tidings.
  I tell you, up, sahib! Boots and saddles! Strike!"</p>

  <p>The general chewed at his mustache another minute.</p>

  <p>"You know this province well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None better than I. I have traversed every yard of it, attending to my
  business."</p>

  <p>"And your business is?"</p>

  <p>"Each to his trade, sahib. My trade is honorable."</p>

  <p>"I have good reasons for asking, and no impertinence is meant. Be good
  enough to tell me. I wish to know what value I may place on your
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I am a full sergeant of the Rajput Horse retired. I bear one
  medal."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I sell charms, sahib."</p>

  <p>"What sort of charms?"</p>

  <p>"All sorts. But principally charms against the evil eye, and the red
  sickness, and death by violence. But, also love-charms now and then, and now
  and then a death-charm to a man who has an enemy and lacks swordsmanship or
  courage. I trade with each and every man, sahib, and listen to the talk of
  each, and hold my tongue!"</p>

  <p>"Strange trade for a soldier, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Would you have me a robber, sahib? Or shall I sweep the streets&mdash; I,
  who have led a troop before now? Nay, sahib! A soldier can fight, and can do
  little else. When the day comes that the Raj has no more need of him
  &mdash;or thinks that it has no more need of him&mdash;he must either starve
  or become a prophet. And his own home is no place for a prophet who would
  turn his prophesying into silver coin!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! Well-now, tell me! What is your opinion, without reference to what
  anybody else may think? You have just seen the massacre at Jailpore, and you
  know how many men I have here. And you know the condition of the road and the
  number of the mutineers. Would you, if you were in my place, strike at
  Jailpore immediately?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib. That I would not. I would strike north. And I would strike so
  swiftly that the mutineers would wonder whence I came. In Jailpore, all is
  over. They have done the harm, and they are in charge there. They have the
  powder-magazine in their possession, and the stands of arms, and the first
  advantage. Leave them there, then, sahib, and strike where you are not
  expected. In Jailpore you would be out of touch. You would have just that
  many more miles to march when the time comes&mdash;and it has come, sahib!
  &mdash;to join forces with the next command, and hit hard at the heart of
  things."</p>

  <p>"And the heart of things is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Delhi!"</p>

  <p>"You display a quite amazing knowledge of the game."</p>

  <p>"I am a soldier, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"You would leave Jailpore, then, to its fate?"</p>

  <p>"Jailpore has already met its fate, sahib. The barracks are afire, and the
  city has been given over to be looted. Reckon no more with Jailpore! Reckon
  only of the others. Listen, sahib! Has any message come from the next
  command? No? Then why? Think you that even a local outbreak could occur
  without some message being sent to you, and to the next division south of
  you? Why has no message come? Where is the next command? The next command
  north? Harumpore? Then why is there no news from Harumpore? I will tell you,
  sahib."</p>

  <p>"You mean, I suppose, that the country is up, in between?"</p>

  <p>"You know that it is up, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"You think that no message could get through to me?"</p>

  <p>"I know that it could not! Else had one already come. My advice to you,
  sahib, as one soldier to another and tendered with all respect, is to up and
  leave this Bholat. Here, of what use are you? Here you can hold a small city,
  until the countryside has time to rise and lay siege to you and hem you in!
  Outside of here, you can be a hornet-storm! They will burn Bholat behind you.
  Let them! Let them, too, pay the price. Swoop down on Harumpore, sahib
  &mdash;join there with Kendrick sahib's command. There make a fresh plan, and
  swoop down on some other place. But move, quickly, and keep on moving! And
  waste no time on places that are already lost."</p>

  <p>"Then you would have me leave those women and that child, that you tell me
  of to their fate?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! I am not of your command. I have done my duty to the Raj, and
  I now go about my own business."</p>

  <p>"And that is?"</p>

  <p>"To repay a debt that I owe the Raj, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Your answers are rather unnecessarily evasive, Juggut Khan. Be good
  enough to explain yourself!"</p>

  <p>"I ride back to Jailpore, sahib. I would have stayed there, but it seemed
  right and soldierly to bring through the news first. Now, I return to do what
  I may to rescue those whom I hid there. I owe that to the Raj!"</p>

  <p>"You mean that you will ride alone?"</p>

  <p>"At least half of the distance, sahib. I had a favor to ask."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Are you marching north, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I have not determined yet."</p>

  <p>"Determined, sahib! This is no hour for dallying! Give orders now! Up!
  Strike, sahib! Listen! Should you march on Jailpore, the mutineers, who far
  outnumber you, will learn beforehand of your coming, and will put the place
  in a state of defense. It may take you weeks to fight your way in! Leave
  Jailpore, and those who are left in it to me, and lend me that
  non-commissioned officer of yours who guards the crossroads, and his twelve
  men. With a few, we can manage what a whole division might fail to do. And
  you march north, sahib, and burn and harry and slay! Strike quickly, where
  the trouble is yet brewing, and not where the day is lost already!"</p>

  <p>It was case of the British power in India on one side of the scale,
  against three women and a child on the other; sentiment in the balance
  against strategy. And strategy must win, especially since this Rajput was
  offering his services.</p>

  <p>"What are their names, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Leslie, wife of Captain Leslie; Mrs. Standish, wife of Colonel
  Standish and mother of Mrs. Leslie; Mrs. Leslie's child&mdash;I know not his
  name, he is but a child in arms&mdash;and the child's nurse."</p>

  <p>The general still found it difficult to make up his mind.</p>

  <p>"What proof have I of you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, my honor is in question! I have a debt to pay!"</p>

  <p>"What debt?"</p>

  <p>"To the Raj."</p>

  <p>"To the Raj?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Sahib! I have but one son, and his life was saved for me by a
  British soldier. A life for a life. Four lives for a life. I ride! I need,
  though, a fresh horse. And I ask for the loan of that sergeant, and those
  twelve men."</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether a man such as you can realize exactly what it means to
  us to know that white women are in Jailpore, at the mercy of black mutineers?
  I mean, are you sufficiently aware of the extreme horror of the
  situation?"</p>

  <p>"Knew you Captain Collins Sahib, of the Jailpore command?"</p>

  <p>"Know him well."</p>

  <p>"Knew you his memsahib?"</p>

  <p>"She was a niece of mine."</p>

  <p>"I slew her myself, with this sword!"</p>

  <p>"When? Why?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday. Because her husband could not get to her himself, and since he
  and I knew each other, and he trusted me. I said to her, 'Memsahib! I have
  your husband's orders!' She asked me 'What orders, Juggut Khan?' I said, 'Why
  ask me, memsahib? Is my task easier, or yours?' She said 'Obey your orders,
  Juggut Khan, and accept my thanks now, since I shall be unable to thank you
  afterward!' And then she looked me bravely in the face, and met her death,
  sahib. Of a truth I know! I am to be trusted!"</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Juggut Khan. And, incidentally, I beg your pardon for
  having doubted you. Have you slept ?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, Sahib. And I sleep not on this side of the crossroads!"</p>

  <p>"I don't place Sergeant Brown under your command&mdash;you'll understand
  that's impossible&mdash;but, it's quite impossible for him to catch me up. He
  may as well cooperate with you. Wait." He paused, and wrote, then continued,
  "Here is a note to him, in which I order him to work with you, and to take
  your advice whenever possible. Go to the stables, and choose any horse you
  like except my first charger. Here&mdash;here is money; you may need some.
  Count that, will you. How much is it? Four hundred rupees? Write out a
  receipt for it. Now, good luck to you, Juggut Khan. And if you should get
  through alive&mdash;I'll pay you the compliment of admitting that you won't
  come through without the women, and I know that Brown won't&mdash;if you
  should have luck, and should happen to get through, why, look for me at
  Harumpore, or elsewhere to the northward of it. I start with my division in
  an hour."</p>

  <p>"Salaam, sahib!" said Rajput, rising and standing at the salute.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Juggut Khan! Take any food, or drink, or clothing that you want.
  Good-by, and your good luck ride with you. I feel like a murderer, but I know
  I've done the best that can be done!"</p>

  <p class="first">Now if Sergeant Brown possessed a sweetheart, and the
  sweetheart lived in England, and if Brown still loved her&mdash;as has
  already been more than hinted at&mdash;it is not at all unreasonable to
  wonder why he had no likeness of her, no news of her, nothing but her memory
  around which to weave the woof of sentiment&mdash;at least, it's not
  unreasonable so to wonder in this late year of grace.</p>

  <p>Then, though, in 1857, when a newspaper cost threepence or thereabouts,
  and schools were so far from being free that only the sons of gentlemen (and
  seldom the daughters of even gentlemen, remember) attended them, the art of
  reading was not so common as it now is. Writing was still more uncommon. And
  it has not been pretended that Brown was other than a commoner. He was a
  stiff-backed man, and honest. And the pride that had raised him to the rank
  of sergeant was even stiffer than his stock. But he came from the ranks that
  owned no vote, nor little else, in those days, and he owned a sweetheart of
  the same rank as himself, who could neither read nor write. And when people
  whose somewhat primitive ideas on right and wrong lead them to look on
  daguerreotypes as works of the devil happen too to be living more than five
  thousand miles apart, when one of the two can not write, nor readily afford
  the cost of postage, and when the other is nearly always on the move from
  post to post, it is not exactly to be wondered at that memory of each other
  was all they had to dwell upon.</p>

  <p>A journey to India in '57 meant, to the rank and file, oblivion and worse.
  There were men then, of course, just as there are now, who would leave a girl
  behind them tied fast by a promise of futile and endless devotion; men who
  knew what the girls did not know&mdash;that India was all but inaccessible to
  any one outside of government employ, and that a common soldier's chance of
  sending for his girl, or of coming home again to claim her, was something in
  the neighborhood of one in thirty thousand.</p>

  <p>But there were other men, like William Brown, who were a shade too honest
  and too stiff-chinned to buckle under to the social conditions of England in
  those days, and who were consequently not exactly pestered with offers of
  employment. And a man who could see the difference between doffing his ragged
  cap to a dissolute squire or parson, and saluting his better on parade, could
  also see the selfishness of leaving an honest girl to languish for him. Brown
  could not get a living in England. So he told his girl to get a better man,
  swung his canvas bag across his shoulder and marched away.</p>

  <p>"What kind of a man is a better man than Bill?" she had wondered. Men like
  Bill seem to have a knack of judging character, and of picking girls who are
  as steadfast as themselves. So it is not to be wondered at that almost before
  her tears were dry she had set about attempting what few women of her type
  and time would have dreamed of. If Bill had set her free, she reasoned, Bill
  had no more authority over her, and she might do exactly what she chose. Bill
  could release, but he could not make her take another man. So, for all that
  the local yeomen, and local tradesmen even, haunted the little cottage on the
  Downs, and pestered her with their attentions, no one supplanted Bill.</p>

  <p>Bill could tell her&mdash;and had told her&mdash;that India was no country
  for a white woman; that there were snakes there, and black men and tigers and
  even worse. But, since he had set her free, if she could manage it she was
  quite at liberty to brave the tigers and the snakes. And, once there, she
  would see whether she was free or not, and whether Bill was, either!</p>

  <p>It took Bill Brown six years of constant honest effort to become a
  sergeant. It took Jane Emmett six weeks of pride-consuming and vexatious
  vigilance to procure for herself a job as nurse in a soldier-family. And it
  took her six more years of unremitting diligence, sweetened by all the
  attributes that seem desirable when nursing other people's children and
  embittered by the shame of grudging patronage, before she was considered
  dependable enough to be recommended for the service of a family just leaving
  for Bengal. Then, however, her world was a real world again!</p>

  <p>Five months on a sailing-ship around the Cape&mdash;deep-laden, gunwales
  awash in a beam&mdash;on Bay-of-Biscay "snorer," hove-to for a week off Cape
  Agul&mdash;has, while the clumsy brigantine rolled the masts loose in her,
  all but dismasted in a typhoon come astray from the China Sea, fed on moldy
  bread, and even moldier pork, with a fretful child to nurse, and an exacting
  mother to be pleased! Jane Emmett laughed at it. Bill had been there before
  her, and had done more on his way, and worse Bengal did not frighten her. Nor
  did the knowledge, when she reached it, that Bill was very likely still some
  hundreds of miles away. She, who had come five thousand miles as the crows
  are said to fly and nine thousand by the map, could manage the odd hundreds.
  And she could wait. She had waited six long years. What was another month or
  two?</p>

  <p>She had not even a notion where Bill was, beyond a vague one that he
  belonged to another province. For when the Honorable East India Company was
  muddling the affairs of India, the honors and emoluments and privileges
  &mdash;such as they were!&mdash;were reserved for the benefit of the
  commissioned ranks.</p>

  <p>So a transfer to Jailpore did not mean to Jane Emmett ten extra degrees of
  heat, the neighborhood of jungle-fever and a brand-new breed of smells. Those
  disadvantages, which weighted down the souls of her employers, were
  completely overshadowed, so far as she was concerned, by the knowledge that
  she was traveling nearer by a hundred leagues or so to where her Bill was
  stationed. She was going west; and somewhere to the west was Bill. Anything
  was good&mdash;fever, and prickly heat, and smells included&mdash;that
  brought her any nearer him.</p>

  <p>There would be no sense in endeavoring to analyze her sensations when the
  sudden outburst overwhelmed the inner-guard at Jailpore. The sight of white
  women being butchered, and of white men with the blood of their own women on
  their hands, selling their lives as dearly as the God of War would let them
  in a holocaust of flames, blinded her. It was probably just a splurge of fire
  and noise and smoke and blood in her memory, with one or two details standing
  out. The only real sensation that she felt&mdash;even when a tall, lean
  Rajput flung her across his shoulder, ran with her and dropped her down
  through a square hole into stifling darkness&mdash;was a longing for Bill
  Brown, her Bill, the one man in the world who could surely stop the
  butchery.</p>

  <p>The others prayed. But she refused to pray. She felt angry&mdash;not
  prayerful! Had she come nine thousand miles, and sacrificed six good years of
  youth and youth's heritage, to be cast into a reeking dungeon and left to die
  there in the dark? Not if Bill should know of it! And so she changed her
  argument, and prayed for Bill. If only Bill knew&mdash;straight-backed,
  honest, stiff-chinned, uncompromising, plain Bill Brown. He would change
  things!</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill! Bill! Bill!" she sobbed. "Dear God, bring Bill to me!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chapA7"
     id="chapA7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When a man knows what is out against him, and from which
  direction he may look to meet death, he only needs to be a very ordinary man
  to make at least a gallant showing. Gallery or no gallery to watch, given
  responsibility and trained men under hire, not one man in a thousand will
  fail to face death with dignity.</p>

  <p>But Brown knew practically nothing, and understood still less, of what was
  happening. He had Juggut Khan's word for it that Jailpore was in flames, and
  that all save four of its European population had been killed. He believed
  that to be a probably exaggerated statement of affairs, but he did not blink
  the fact that he might expect to be overwhelmed almost without notice, and at
  any minute. That was a fact which he accepted, for the sake of argument and
  as a working-basis on which to build a plan of some kind&mdash;His orders
  were to hold that post, and he would hold it until relieved by General Baines
  or death. But there are several ways of holding a hot coal besides the rather
  obvious one of sitting on it.</p>

  <p>It would have been a fine chance to be theatrical, had play-acting been in
  his line. Many and many a full-blown general has risen to authority and fame
  by means of absolutely useless gallery-play. He believed that he would
  presently be relieved by General Baines, who he felt sure would march at once
  on Jailpore; and had he chosen to he could have addressed the men, have set
  them to throwing up defenses and have made a nice theatrical redoubt that he
  could have held quite easily with the help of nine men for a day or two. And
  since the really worthwhile things go often unrewarded, but the gallery-plays
  never, nobody would have blamed him had he chosen some such course as
  that.</p>

  <p>But Brown's idea of holding down a place was to make that place a thorn in
  the side of the enemy. And since he did not know who was the enemy, or where
  he was, nor why he was an enemy, nor when he would attack, he proposed to
  find out these things for himself preparatory to making the said enemy as
  uncomfortable as his meager resources would permit, when eked out by an
  honest "dogged-does-it" brain.</p>

  <p>He buried the three men whom Fate had seemed to value at the price of a
  fakir's freedom. And, being a religious man, to whom religion was a fact and
  the rest of the universe a theory, he was able to say a full funeral service
  over them from memory. He said it at the grave-end, with a lantern in his
  hand and one man facing him across the grave&mdash;as the English used to
  drink when the Danes had landed, each watching for the glint of steel beyond
  the other's shoulder.</p>

  <p>And, four on each side of the trench that they had dug, the remainder
  knelt and faced the night each way&mdash;partly from enforced piety, and
  partly because eight men back to back, with their bayonets outward and their
  butts against their knees, are an awkward proposition for an enemy. They
  mumbled the responses because Brown made them do it, and they kept their eyes
  skinned because the night seemed full of other eyes, and sounds.</p>

  <p>"And now, you men," said Brown, changing his voice to suit the nature of
  his task, "you can get your sleep by fours. I don't care which four of you
  goes to sleep first, but there are only two watches of us left, and there are
  about four hours left to sleep in, by my reckoning. That's two hours' sleep
  for each man. And we'll keep clear of the guardroom. As I understand my
  orders, the important point's the cross-roads. I'm supposed to halt every one
  who comes, and to ask him his business. And that'd be impossible to do from
  the guardroom here. Let this be a lesson to you men, now. In interpretin'
  orders, when a point's in doubt, always look for the meaning of the orders
  rather than the letter of them, obeying the letter only when the meaning and
  the letter are the same thing. The letter of our orders says the guardroom.
  The meaning's clear. We're here to guard the cross-roads. We take the
  meaning, and let the letter hang!</p>

  <p>"Besides! The way it seems to me, if there's any more trouble cooking in
  this neighborhood, it's going to cook pretty fast, and it's going to boil
  around that guardroom; and if we're not in the guardroom, why, that's point
  number one for us! Leave the guardroom lantern lighted, and bring out nothing
  but your cartridge-pouches and the box of ammunition. Leave everything else
  where it lies. Quick, now."</p>

  <p>They obeyed him on the run, afraid to be out of his sight for a moment
  even, trusting him as little children trust a nurse, and ready to do anything
  so long as he would only keep them up and doing, and not make them stay by
  the scene of the murders. Brown knew their state of mind as accurately as he
  knew the range of their service rifles, and he knew just how he could best
  keep panic from them. He knew too, if not what was best to do, at least what
  he intended doing, and he knew how he could best get them in a state to do
  it.</p>

  <p>Behind his own mind lay all the while a sense of loneliness and
  hopelessness. He did not entertain the thought of failure to hold the
  crossroads, and he was so certain that General Baines would come with his
  division that he could almost see the advance-guard trotting toward him down
  the trunk road. But there is no accounting for a soldier's moods, and
  something told him&mdash;something deep down inside him that he could neither
  name nor understand&mdash;that he was out now on the adventure of a lifetime,
  and that the heart-cord which had held him tight to England all these years
  had been cut. He felt gloomy and dispirited, but not a man of the nine who
  followed him had the slightest inkling of it.</p>

  <p>He halted them outside the guardroom, and bullydamned two of them because
  some unimportant part of their accouterments was missing; and he "'Tshuned"
  them, and stood them at ease, and "'Tshuned" them again, until he had them
  jumping at the word. Then he marched them two abreast in and out among the
  huts in search of any sign of native servants. They found no sign of any one
  at all. Though in that black darkness it would have been quite possible for
  half a hundred men to lie undetected. Brown decided that the camp was empty.
  He thought it probable that any one concealed there would have tried his luck
  on somebody at least, at close range as he passed.</p>

  <p>So he marched them back to the guard-room once again, and sent two of them
  in to drag out the shivering Beluchi, who had taken cover underneath a cot
  and refused to come out until he was dragged out by the leg. The native's
  terror served to pull the men together quite a little, for Tommy Atkins
  always does and always did behave himself with pride when what he is pleased
  to consider his inferiors are anywhere about. They showed that unfortunate
  Beluchi how white men marched into the darkness&mdash;best foot foremost;
  without halt or hesitation, when ghosts or murderers or unseen marksmen were
  close at hand.</p>

  <p>The Beluchi let himself be dragged, trembling, between two of them. It was
  he who first saw something move, or heard some one breathe. For he was
  absolutely on edge, and had nothing to attend to but his own fear. The others
  had to keep both eyes and ears lifting, to please Brown the exacting. The
  Beluchi struggled and held back, almost breaking loose, and actually tearing
  his loin-cloth.</p>

  <p>"Sahib!" he whispered hoarsely. "Sahib!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" demanded Brown, scarcely waiting for an answer, though.
  Something told him what it was that moved, and his own skin felt goose-fleshy
  from neck to heel.</p>

  <p>"The fakir, sahib!"</p>

  <p>There was a murmur through the ranks, a sibilant indrawing of the
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Did I hear anybody swear?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>Nobody answered him. All nine men stood stock-still, leaning on their
  rifles, their heads craned forward and their eyes strained in the direction
  of the gloomy baobab.</p>

  <p>"Form single rank!" commanded Brown.</p>

  <p>There was no response. They stood there fixed like a row of chickens
  staring at a snake!</p>

  <p>"Form single rank!"</p>

  <p>He leaped at them, and broke the first rule of the service&mdash;as a man
  may when he is man enough, and the alternative would be black shame.</p>

  <p>His fist was a hard one and heavy, and they felt the weight of it.</p>

  <p>"Form single rank! Take one pace open order! Extend! Now, forward&mdash;
  by the right! Right dress, there!"</p>

  <p>He marched in front of them, and they followed him for very shame, now
  that he had broken their paralysis.</p>

  <p>"Halt! Port-arms! Charge bayonets!"</p>

  <p>He was peering at something in the dark, something that chuckled and
  smelled horrible, and sat unusually still for anything that lived.</p>

  <p>"Numbers One, Two, Three&mdash;left wheel&mdash;forward! Halt! Numbers
  Seven, Eight, Nine&mdash;right wheel&mdash;forward! Halt!"</p>

  <p>They were standing now on three sides of a square. The fourth side was the
  trunk of the baobab. Between them and the trunk, the streaming tendrils
  swayed and swung, bats flitted and something still invisible sat still and
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"One pace forward&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>They could see now. The fakir sat and stared at them and grinned. Brown
  raised the lamp and let its rays fall on him. The light glinted off his eyes,
  and off the only other part of him that shone&mdash;the long, curved, ghastly
  fingernails that had grown through the palm of his upstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"How did you get here?" demanded Brown, not afraid to speak, for fear that
  fright would take possession of himself as well as of his men, but quite well
  aware that the fakir would not answer him. Then he remembered the
  Beluchi.</p>

  <p>"Ask him, you! Ask him how he came here."</p>

  <p>The Beluchi found his tongue, and stammered out a question. The fakir
  chuckled, and following his chuckle let a guttural remark escape him.</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that he flew!"</p>

  <p>"Ask him, could he fly with nine fixed bayonets in him!"</p>

  <p>There was a little laughter from the men at that sally. It takes very
  little in the way of humor to dispel a sense of the uncanny or
  mysterious.</p>

  <p>"He answers, sahib, that you have seen what comes of striking him. He asks
  how many dead there be."</p>

  <p>"Does he want me to hold him answerable for those men's lives?"</p>

  <p>"He says he cares not, sahib! He says that he has promised what shall
  befall you, sahib, before a day is past&mdash;you and one other!"</p>

  <p>"Ask him, where is the Punjabi skin-buyer?"</p>

  <p>The fakir chuckled at that question, and let out suddenly a long, low,
  hollow-sounding howl, like a she-wolf's just at sundown. He was answered by
  another howl from near the guardroom, and every soldier faced about as though
  a wasp had stung him.</p>

  <p>"Front!" commanded Brown. "Now, one of you, about turn! Keep watch that
  way! Is that the Punjabi?&mdash;ask him."</p>

  <p>"He says 'Yes!' sahib. He and others!"</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now tell him that unless he obeys my orders on the jump, word
  for word as I give them, I'll hang him as high as Haman by that withered arm
  of his, and have him beaten on the toenails with a cleaning-rod before I fill
  him so full of bayonet-holes that the vultures'll take him for a sponge! Say
  I'm a man of my word, and don't exaggerate."</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated.</p>

  <p>"He says you dare not, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Advise him to talk sense."</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, 'You have had one lesson!"'</p>

  <p>"Now it's my turn to give him one. Men! We'll have to give up that sleep I
  talked about. This limping dummy of a fakir thinks he's got us frightened,
  and we've got to teach him different. There's some reason why we're not being
  attacked as yet. There's something fishy going on, and this swab's at the
  bottom of it! We want him, too, on a charge of murder, or instigating murder,
  and the guardroom's the best place for him. To the guardroom with him. He'll
  do for a hostage anyhow. And where he is, I've a notion that the control of
  this treachery won't be far away! Grab him below the arms and by the legs.
  One of you hold a bayonet-point against his ribs. The rest, face each way on
  guard. Now&mdash;all together, forward to the guardroom&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>The fakir howled. Ululating howls replied from the surrounding night, and
  once a red light showed for a second and disappeared in front of them. Then
  the fakir howled again.</p>

  <p>"Look, sahib! See! The guardroom!"</p>

  <p>It was the Beluchi who saw it first&mdash;the one who was most afraid of
  things in general and the least afraid of Sergeant Brown. A little flame had
  started in the thatch.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" ordered Brown. "Two of you hold the fakir! The remainder&mdash;
  volley-firing&mdash;kneeling&mdash;point-blank range. Ready&mdash;as you
  were&mdash;independent firing&mdash;ready! Now, wait till you see 'em in the
  firelight, then blaze away all you like!"</p>

  <p>His last words were cut off short by the sound of rifle-fire. Each rifle
  in turn barked out, and three rifles answered from the night.</p>

  <p>"Let that fakir feel a bayonet-point, somebody!"</p>

  <p>The fakir cursed between his teeth, in proof of prompt obedience by one of
  the men who held him.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to order his crowd to cease fire!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated, and the fakir howled again. The flames leaped
  through the thatch, and in a minute more the countryside was lit for half a
  mile or more by the glare of the burning guardroom.</p>

  <p>The flames betrayed more than a hundred turbaned men, who hugged the
  shadows.</p>

  <p>"Keep that bayonet-point against his ribs. See? That comes o' moving
  instead o' sitting still! If we'd shut ourselves in the guardroom there, we'd
  have been merrily roasting in there now! We stole a march on them. Beauty
  here was sitting on his throne to see the fun. Didn't expect us. Thought we'd
  be all hiding under the beds, like Sidiki here! Goes to prove the worst thing
  that a soldier can do is to sit still when there's trouble. We're better off
  than ever. We're free and they won't dare do much to us as long as we've got
  Sacred-Smells-and-Stinks in charge. Form up round him, men, and keep your
  eyes skinned till morning!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chapA8"
     id="chapA8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Of course, discussing matters in the light of history, with
  full and intimate knowledge of everything that had a bearing on the Mutiny,
  there are plenty of club-armchair critics who maintain that England could not
  do otherwise than win in '57. They always do say that afterward of the side
  that won the day.</p>

  <p>But then, with history yet to make, things looked very different, and
  nobody pretended that there was any certainty of anything except a victory
  for the mutineers. All that either side recognized as likely to reverse
  conditions was the notorious ability that a beaten and cornered British army
  has for upsetting certainties. So the rebels had more than a little argument
  as to what steps should be taken next, once the initial butchery and loot had
  taken place.</p>

  <p>For instance, in Jailpore</p>

  <p>More than a hundred fakirs and wandering priests and mendicants had sent
  in word that the province from end to end was ready, and that the British
  slept. But there were those in Jailpore who distrusted fakirs and religious
  votaries of every kind. They believed them fully capable of rousing the
  countryside, of working on the religious feelings of the unsophisticated
  rustics and setting them to murdering and plundering right and left. But they
  doubted their ability to judge of the army's sleepiness. These doubters were
  the older men, who had had experience of England's craft in war. They knew of
  the ability of some at least of England's generals to match guile against
  guile, and back up guile with swift, unexpected hammer-strokes.</p>

  <p>There were men who claimed that what had happened in Jailpore would be
  repeated in Bholat and elsewhere. There was no need, these maintained, to
  march and join hands with other rebels. Each unit was sufficient to itself.
  Each city would be a British funeral pyre. Why march?</p>

  <p>Some said, "The general at Bholat will learn of the massacre, and will
  learn too, that not quite all were killed. He will come hotfoot to find the
  four we could not find. For these British are as cobras; slay the he cobra
  and the she one comes to seek revenge. Slay the she one and beware! Her
  husband will track thee down, and strike thee. They are not ordinary
  folk!"</p>

  <p>There were other factions that maintained that General Baines was strong
  enough, with his three thousand, to hold Bholat, unless the men of Jailpore
  marched, to join hands with the Bholatis&mdash;who were surely in revolt by
  this time. There were others who declared that he would leave Bholat and
  Jailpore to their fates without any doubt at all, and would march to join
  hands with the nearest contingent, at Harumpore.</p>

  <p>The bolder spirits of this latter faction were for setting off at once to
  prevent this combination. For a little while their arguments almost
  prevailed.</p>

  <p>But another faction yet, and an even more numerous one, insisted it were
  best to wait for news from other centers.</p>

  <p>Why march, they argued, why strike, why run unnecessary risks, before they
  knew what was happening elsewhere?</p>

  <p>"Surely," these argued, "the English will hear that four here are still
  unaccounted for. Some attempt will be made to find and rescue them. But if we
  find and slay them, and send their heads to Bholat, then will the English
  know that they are indeed dead. Then there will be no attempt at rescue, and
  we shall hold Jailpore unmolested as headquarters."</p>

  <p>That piece of logic won the day for a while, and parties were made up to
  explore the place, and search in every nook and cranny for the three women.
  and a child who surely had not passed out through any of the gates, and who
  were therefore just as surely in the city. A reward was offered by the
  committee of rebel-leaders and, although nobody believed that the reward
  would actually be paid, the opportunities for looting privately while
  searching were so great that the search was thorough.</p>

  <p>It failed, though, for the very simple reason that nobody suspected that
  the huge stone trap-door in the floor of the powder-magazine had ever been
  opened, or ever could be opened. The magazine had been a white man's watch.
  White men had kept guard over it for more than a hundred years, and the
  natives had forgotten that a maze of tunnels and caverns lay beneath it.</p>

  <p>So, while bayonet-points and swords were pushed into crevices, while smoke
  was sent down passages and tunnels and great, loose-limbed, slobbering hounds
  were led on the leash and cast to find a trail, the three women and the child
  lay still beneath the piled-up powder, and doled out water, and biscuit in
  siege-time measures. They lay in pitch-darkness, in a vault where not even a
  sound could reach them, except the whispered echo of their own voices and the
  scampering of the rats. They were growing nearly blind, and nearly crazed,
  with the darkness and the silence and the fear.</p>

  <p>Every second they expected to see daylight through the cracks above, as
  rebels levered up the door, or to hear feet and voices coming through the
  vaults below, for doubtless the vaults led somewhere. But for their fear of
  snakes and rats and unknown horrors, they would have tried to find a way
  through the vaults themselves. But as each movement that they made, and each
  word that they spoke, sent echoes reverberating through the gloom, they lay
  still and shuddered.</p>

  <p>Once they heard footsteps on the stone flags overhead. But the footsteps
  went away again, and then all was still. Soon they lost all count of time.
  They were only aware of heat and discomfort and fear and utter weariness.</p>

  <p>One woman and an infant wept. One woman prayed aloud incessantly. The
  third woman&mdash;the menial, the worst educated and least enlightened of the
  three, according to the others' notion of it&mdash;stubbornly refused to
  admit that there was not some human means of rescue.</p>

  <p>"If Bill were here," she kept on grumbling, "Bill'd find a way!"</p>

  <p>And in the darkness that surrounded her she felt that she could see Bill's
  face, as she remembered it&mdash;red-cheeked and clean-shaven&mdash;six years
  or more ago.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapA9"
     id="chapA9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The blazing roof of the guardroom lit up even the crossroads
  for a while, and Brown and his men could see that for the present there was a
  good wide open space between them and the enemy. The firelight showed a tree
  not far from the crossroads, and since anything is cover to men who are
  surrounded and outnumbered, they made for that tree with one accord, and
  without a word from Brown.</p>

  <p>"We've all the luck," said Brown. "There's not a detachment of any other
  army in the world would walk straight on to a find like this!"</p>

  <p>He held up one frayed end of a manila rope, that was wound around the
  tree-trunk. Some tethered ox had rendered them that service.</p>

  <p>"Fifty feet of good manila, and a fakir that needs hanging! Anybody see
  the connection?"</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of ready laughter, and the two men who had the
  unenviable task of carrying the fakir picked him up and tossed him to the
  tree-trunk. The roof of the guardhouse was blazing fiercely, and now they had
  fired the other roofs. The fakir, the tree and the little bunch of men who
  held him prisoner were as plainly visible as though it had been daytime. A
  bullet pinged past Brown's ear, and buried itself in the tree-trunk with a
  thud.</p>

  <p>"Let him feel that bayonet again!" said Brown.</p>

  <p>A rifleman obeyed, and the fakir howled aloud. An answering howl from
  somewhere beyond the dancing shadows told that the fakir had been
  understood.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Brown, paraphrasing the well-remembered wording of the
  drill-book, in another effort to get his men to laughing again, "when hanging
  a fakir by numbers&mdash;at the word one, place the noose smartly round the
  fakir's neck. At the word two, the right-hand man takes the bight of the rope
  in the hollow of his left hand, and climbs the tree, waiting on the first
  branch suitable for the last sound of the word three. At the last sound of
  the word three, he slips the rope smartly over the bough of the tree and
  descends smartly to the ground, landing on the balls of his feet and coming
  to attention. At the word four, the remainder seize the loose end of the
  rope, being careful to hold it in such a way that the fakir has a chance to
  breathe. And at the last sound of the word five, you haul all together,
  lifting the fakir off the ground, and keeping him so until ordered to
  release. Now&mdash;one!"</p>

  <p>He had tied a noose while he was speaking, and the fakir had watched him
  with eyes that blazed with hate. A soldier seized the noose, and slipped it
  over the fakir's head.</p>

  <p>"Two!"</p>

  <p>The tree was an easy one to climb. "Two" and "three" were the work of not
  more than a minute.</p>

  <p>"Four!" commanded Brown, and the rope drew tight across the bough. The
  fakir had to strain his chin upward in order to draw his breath.</p>

  <p>"Steady, now!"</p>

  <p>The men were lined out in single file, each with his two hands on the
  rope. Not half of them were really needed to lift such a wizened load as the
  fakir, but Brown was doing nothing without thought, and wasting not an
  effort. He wanted each man to be occupied, and even amused. He wanted the
  audience, whom he could not see, but who he knew were all around him in the
  shadows, to get a full view of what was happening. They might not have seen
  so clearly, had he allowed one-half of the men to be lookers-on.</p>

  <p>"Steady!" he repeated. "Be sure and let him breathe, until I give the
  word." Then he seized the cowering Beluchi by the neck, and dragged him up
  close beside the fakir. "Translate, you!" he ordered. "To the crowd out
  yonder first. Shout to 'em, and be careful to make no mistakes."</p>

  <p>"Speak, then, sahib! What shall I say?"</p>

  <p>"Say this. This most sacred person here is our prisoner. He will die the
  moment any one attempts to rescue him."</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated, and repeated word for word.</p>

  <p>"I will now talk with him, and he himself will talk with you, and thus we
  will come to an arrangement!"'</p>

  <p>There was a commotion in the shadows, and somewhere in the neighborhood of
  fifty men appeared, keeping at a safe distance still, but evidently anxious
  to get nearer.</p>

  <p>"Now talk to the fakir, and not so loudly! Ask him 'Are you a sacred
  person?' Ask him softly, now!"</p>

  <p>"He says 'Yes,' sahib, 'I am sacred!"'</p>

  <p>"Do you want to die?"</p>

  <p>"All men must die!"</p>

  <p>The answer made an opening for an interminable discussion, of the kind
  that fakirs and their kindred love. But Brown was not bent just then on
  dissertation. He changed his tactics.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to die, a little slowly, before all those obedient worshipers
  of yours, and in such a way that they will see and understand that you can
  not help yourself, and therefore are a fraud?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi repeated the question in the guttural tongue that apparently
  the fakir best understood. In the fitful light cast by the burning roofs, it
  was evident that the fakir had been touched in the one weak spot of his
  armor.</p>

  <p>There can scarcely be more than one reason why a man should torture
  himself and starve himself and maim and desecrate and horribly defile
  himself. At first sight, the reason sounds improbable, but consideration will
  confirm it. It is vanity, of an iron-bound kind, that makes the wandering
  fakir.</p>

  <p>"Ask him again!" said Brown.</p>

  <p>But again the fakir did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Tell him that I'm going to let him save his face, provided he saves mine.
  Explain that I, too, have men who think I am something more than human!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi interpreted, and Brown thought that the fakir's eyes gleamed
  with something rather more than their ordinary baleful light. It might have
  been the dancing flames that lit them, but Brown thought he saw the dawn of
  reason.</p>

  <p>"Say that if I let my men kill him, my men will believe me superhuman, and
  his men will know that he is only a man with a withered arm! But tell him
  this: He's got the best chance he ever had to perform a miracle, and have the
  whole of this province believe in him forevermore."</p>

  <p>Again the fakir's eyes took on a keener than usual glare, as he listened
  to the Beluchi. He did not nod, though, and he made no other sign, beyond the
  involuntary evidence of understanding that his eyes betrayed.</p>

  <p>"His men can see that noose round his neck, tell him. And his men know me,
  more or less, and British methods anyhow. They believe now, they're sure,
  they're positive that his neck's got about as much chance of escaping from
  that noose as a blind cow has of running from a tiger. Now then! Tell him
  this. Let him come the heavy fakir all he likes. Tell him to tell his gang
  that he's going to give an order. Let him tell them that when he says 'Hookum
  hai!' my men'll loose his neck straight away, and fall down flat. Only, first
  of all he's got to tell them that he needs us for the present. Let him say
  that he's got an extra-special awful death in store for us by and by, and
  that he's going to keep us by him until he's ready to work the miracle.
  Meantime, nobody's to touch us, or come near us, except to bring him and us
  food!"</p>

  <p>The fakir listened, and said nothing. At a sign from Brown the rope
  tightened just a little. The fakir raised his chin.</p>

  <p>"And tell him that, if he doesn't do what I say, and exactly what I say,
  and do it now, he's got just so long to live as it takes a man to choke his
  soul out!"</p>

  <p>The fakir answered nothing.</p>

  <p>"Just ever such a wee bit tighter, men!"</p>

  <p>The fakir lost his balance, and had to scramble to his feet and stand
  there swaying on his heels, clutching at the rope above him with his one
  uninjured hand, and sawing upward with his head for air. There came a murmur
  from the shadows, and a dozen breech-bolts clicked. There seemed no
  disposition to lie idle while the holiest thing in a temple-ridden province
  dangled in mid-air.</p>

  <p>"In case of a rush," said Brown quietly, "all but two of you let go! The
  remainder seize your rifles and fire independently. The two men on the rope,
  haul taut, and make fast to the tree-trunk. This tree's as good a place to
  die as anywhere, but he dies first! Understand?"</p>

  <p>The fakir rolled his eyes, and tried to make some sort of signal with his
  free arm.</p>

  <p>"Just a wee shade tighter!" ordered Brown. "I'm not sure, but I think he's
  seeing reason!"</p>

  <p>The fakir gurgled. No one but a native, and he a wise one, could have
  recognized a meaning in the guttural gasp that he let escape him.</p>

  <p>"He says 'All right! sahib!' " translated the Beluchi.</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Brown. "Ease away on the rope; men! And now! You all heard
  what I told him. If he says 'Hookum hai!' you all let go the rope, and fall
  flat. But keep hold of your rifles!"</p>

  <p>The fakir's voice, rose in a high-pitched, nasal wail, and from the
  darkness all around them there came an answering murmur that was like the
  whispering of wind through trees. By the sound, there must have been a crowd
  of more than a hundred there, and either the crowd was sneaking around them
  to surround them at close quarters, or else the crowd was growing.</p>

  <p>"Keep awake, men!" cautioned Brown.</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, sir! All awake, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Listen, now! And if he says one word except what I told him he might say,
  tip me the wink at once "</p>

  <p>Brown swung the Beluchi out in front of him where he could hear the fakir
  better.</p>

  <p>"I'll hang you, remember, after I've hanged him, if anything goes
  wrong!"</p>

  <p>"He is saying, sahib, exactly what you said."</p>

  <p>"He'd better! Listen now! Listen carefully! Look out for tricks!"</p>

  <p>The fakir paused a second from his high-pitched monologue, and a murmur
  from the darkness answered him.</p>

  <p>"Stand by to haul tight, you men!"</p>

  <p>"All ready, sir!"</p>

  <p>The rope tightened just a little&mdash;just sufficiently to keep the fakir
  cognizant of its position. The fakir howled out a sort of singsong dirge,
  which plainly had imperatives in every line of it. At each short pause for
  breath he added something in an undertone that made the Beluchi strain his
  ears.</p>

  <p>"He says, sahib, that they understand. He says, 'Now is the time!' He says
  now he will order 'Hookum hai!' He says, 'Are you ready?' He says, sahib,
  &mdash;he says it, sahib,&mdash;not I&mdash;he says, 'Thou art a fool to
  stare thus! Thou and thy men are fools! Stare, instead, as men who are
  bewitched!'"</p>

  <p>"Try to look like boiled owls, to oblige his Highness, men!" said Brown.
  "Now, that's better; watch for the word! Easy on the rope a little!"</p>

  <p>The men did their best to pose for the part of semimesmerized victims of a
  superhuman power. The flame from the burning roofs was dying down already,
  for the thatch burned fast, and the glowing gloom was deep enough to hide
  indifferent acting. With their lives at stake, though, men act better than
  they might at other times.</p>

  <p>The fakir spun round on his heels and, clutching with his whole hand at
  the rope, began to execute a sort of dance&mdash;a weird, fantastic, horrible
  affair of quivering limbs and rolling eyeballs, topped by a withered arm that
  pointed upward, and a tortured fingernail-pierced fist that nodded on a
  dried-out wrist-joint.</p>

  <p>"Hookum hai!" he screamed suddenly, waving his sound hand upward, and
  bringing it down suddenly with a jerk, as though by sheer force he was
  blasting them.</p>

  <p>"Down with you!" ordered Brown, and all except Brown and the Beluchi
  tumbled over backward.</p>

  <p>"Keep hold of your rifles!" ordered Brown.</p>

  <p>The fakir's wailing continued for a while. With his own hand he took the
  noose from his neck and, now that the flames had died away to nothing but
  spasmodic spurts above a dull red underglow, there was no one in the watching
  ring who could see Brown's sword-point. Only Brown and the fakir knew that it
  was scratching at the skin between the fakir's shoulder-blades.</p>

  <p>"It is done!" said the fakir presently. "Now take me back to my dais
  again!" And the Beluchi translated.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to hear their trigger-springs released," suggested Brown. "This
  has all been a shade too slick for me. I've got my doubts yet about it's
  being done. Tell him to order them to uncock their rifles, so that I can hear
  them do it."</p>

  <p>"He says that they are gone already!" translated the Beluchi.</p>

  <p>"Tell him I don't believe it!" answered Brown, whose eyes were straining
  to pierce the darkness, which was blacker than the pit again by now.</p>

  <p>The fakir raised his voice into a howl&mdash;a long, low, ululating howl
  like that he had uttered when they found him on his dais. From the distance,
  beyond the range of rifles, came a hundred answering howls. The fakir waited,
  and a minute later a hundred howls were raised again, this time from an even
  greater distance.</p>

  <p>Then he spoke.</p>

  <p>"He says that they are gone," translated the Beluchi. "He says he will go
  back to his dais again."</p>

  <p>"'Tshun!" ordered Brown. "Now, men, just because we've saved our skins so
  far is no reason why we should neglect precautions. We're going to put this
  imitation angel back on his throne again, so the same two carry him that
  brought him here. There's no sense in giving two more men the itch, and all
  the other ailments the brute suffers from! Form up round him, the rest. Take
  open order&mdash;say two paces&mdash;and go slow. Feel your way with your
  fixed bayonet, and don't take a step in the dark until you're sure where it
  will lead you. Forward&mdash;march! One of you bring that rope along."</p>

  <p>The weird procession crawled and crept and sidled back to where it had
  started from not so long before&mdash;jumping at every sound, and at every
  shadow that showed deeper than the coal-black night around them. It took them
  fifteen minutes to recross a hundred yards. But when they reached the earthen
  throne again at last, and had hoisted the fakir back in position on it, there
  had been no casualties, and the morale of the men in Sergeant Brown's command
  was as good again as the breech-mechanism of the rifles in his charge.</p>

  <p>They were scarcely visible to him or one another in the blackness, but he
  sensed the change in them, and changed his own tune to fit the changed
  condition.</p>

  <p>His voice had nothing in it but the abrupt military explosion when he gave
  his orders now&mdash;no argument, no underlying sympathy. He was no longer
  herding a flock of frightened children. He was ordering trained, grown men,
  and he knew it and they knew it. The orders ripped out, like the crack of a
  drover's whip.</p>

  <p>"Fall in, now, properly! 'Tshun! Right dress! To two paces&mdash;open
  order&mdash;from the center&mdash;extend! Now, then! Left and right wings
  &mdash;last three at each end forward&mdash;right wheel&mdash;halt. That's
  it. 'Bout face. Now each man keep two eyes lifting till the morning. If
  anything shows up, or any of you hear a sound, shoot first and challenge
  afterward!"</p>

  <p>They were standing so when the pale sun greeted them, in hollow square,
  with their backs toward the fakir, who was squatting, staring straight in
  front of him, on his dais, with his back turned to the tree and his withered
  arm still pointing up to heaven like a dead man's calling to the gods for
  vengeance.</p>

  <p>A little later, Brown made each alternate man lie down and get what sleep
  he could just where he was, with a comrade standing over him. He himself
  slept so for a little while. But one of the men heard something move among
  the hanging tendrils of the baobab, investigated with his bayonet-point, and
  managed to transfix a twelve-foot python. After that there was, not so much
  desire for sleep. The fakir either slept with his eyes open or else dispensed
  with sleep. No one seemed able to determine which.</p>

  <p>When the day grew hotter, and the utterly remorseless Indian sun bore down
  on them, and on the aching desolation of the plain and the burnt-out
  guardhouse, the fakir still sat unblinking, gazing straight out in front of
  him, with eyes that hated but did nothing else. He seemed to have no time nor
  thought nor care for anything but hate and the expression of it.</p>

  <p>At noon, three little children came to him, and brought him water in a
  small brass bowl, and cooked-up vegetables wrapped in some kind of leaf.
  Brown let him have theirs, and bribed the frightened children to go and bring
  water for the men and himself. He gave them the unheard-of wealth of one
  rupee between them, and they went off with it&mdash;and did not come
  back.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the fakir had drunk his water, and had poured out what was left.
  He had also eaten what the children had brought him, and suddenly, from
  vacant, implacable hatred, he woke up and began to be amused.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" he laughed at them. "Ho-ho!" And then he launched out with a
  string of eloquence that Brown called on the Beluchi to translate.</p>

  <p>"Who said there would be thirst, and the sound of water! Is there a
  thirst? Who spoke of an anthill and of hungry ants and raw red openings in
  the flesh for the little ants to run in and out more easily?"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi translated faithfully, and the men all listened.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to hold his tongue!" growled Brown at last.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!" laughed the fakir. "The heat grows great, and the
  tongues grow dry, and none bring water! Ho-ho! But I told them that I needed
  these for a deadlier death than any they devised! Ho-ho-ho-ho! Look at the
  little crows, how they wait in the branches! Ha-ha-ha-ha! See how the kites
  come! Where are the vultures? Wait! What speck sails in the sky there? Even
  the vultures come! Ho-ho-ho-ho!"</p>

  <p>"I hear a horse, sir!" said one of the men who watched.</p>

  <p>"I heard it more than a minute ago," said Brown.</p>

  <p>The fakir stopped his mockery, and even he listened.</p>

  <p>"Ask him," said Brown, "where are the men who set fire to the
  guardroom?"</p>

  <p>"He says they are in the village, waiting till he sends for them!" said
  the Beluchi.</p>

  <p>"Keep an eye lifting, you men," ordered Brown. "This'll be a messenger
  from Bholat, ten to one. Mind they don't ambush him! Watch every way at once,
  and shoot at anything that moves!"</p>

  <p>"Clippety-clippety-clippety-cloppety&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sound of a galloping horse grew nearer; a horse hard-ridden, that was
  none the less sure-footed still, and going strong in spite of sun and heat.
  Suddenly a foam-flecked black mare swung round a bend between two banks, and
  the sun shone on a polished saber-hilt. A turbaned Rajput rose in his
  stirrups, gazed left and right and then in front of him&mdash;from the
  burned-out guardhouse to the baobab&mdash;drew rein to a walk and waved his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"By all that's good and great and wonderful," said Brown aloud, "if here's
  not Juggut Khan again!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapA10"
     id="chapA10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is not easy to give any kind of real impression of India
  twenty-four hours after the outbreak of the mutiny. Movement was the keynote
  of the picture&mdash;stealthy, not-yet-quite-confident pack-movement on the
  one hand, concentrated here and there in blood-red eddies, and, on the other
  hand, swift, desperate marches in the open.</p>

  <p>The moment that the seriousness of the outbreak had been understood, and
  the orders had gone out by galloper to "Get a move on!" each commanding
  officer strained every nerve at once to strike where a blow would have the
  most effect. There was no thought of anything but action, and offensive, not
  defensive action. Until some one at the head of things proved still to be
  alive, and had had time to form a plan, each divisional commander acted as he
  saw fit. That was all that any one was asked to do at first: to act, to
  strike, to plunge in headlong where the mutiny was thickest and most
  dangerous, to do anything, in fact; except sit still.</p>

  <p>Even with the evidence of mutiny and treachery on every side, with red
  flames lighting the horizon and the stench of burning villages on every hand,
  the strange Anglo-Saxon quality persisted that has done more even that the
  fighting-quality to teach the English tongue to half the world. The native
  servants who had not yet run away retained their places still, unquestioned.
  When an Englishman has once made up his mind to trust another man, he trusts
  him to the hilt, whatever shade of brown or red or white his hide may be.</p>

  <p>But, since every rule has its exceptions, there were some among the native
  servants, who remained ostensibly loyal to their masters, who would better
  have been shot or hanged at the first suggestion of an outbreak. For
  naturally a man who is trusted wrongly is far more dangerous than one who is
  held in suspicion. But it never was the slightest use endeavoring to persuade
  an average English officer that his own man could be anything but loyal. He
  may be a thief and a liar and a proved-up rogue in every other way; but as
  for fearing to let him sleep about the house, or fearing to let him cook his
  master's food, or fearing to let him carry firearms&mdash;well! Perhaps, it
  is conceit, or maybe just ordinary foolishness. It is not fear!</p>

  <p>So, in a country where the art of poisoning has baffled analysts since
  analysts have been invented, and where blood-hungry fanatic priests, both
  Hindu and Mohammedan, were preaching and promising the reward of highest
  heaven to all who could kill an Englishman or die in the attempt, a native
  cook whose antecedents were obscured in mystery cooked dinner for a British
  general, and marched with his column to perform the same service while the
  general tried to trounce the cook's friends and relatives!</p>

  <p>But General Baines felt perfectly at ease about his food. He never gave a
  thought to it, but ate what was brought to him, sitting his horse most
  likely, and chewing something as he rode among the men, and saw that they
  filled their bellies properly. He had made up his mind to march on Harumpore,
  and to take over the five-hundred-strong contingent there. Then he could
  swoop down on any of a dozen other points, in any one of which a blow would
  tell.</p>

  <p>He was handicapped by knowing almost too much. He had watched so long, and
  had suspected for so long that some sort of rebellion was brewing that, now
  that it had come, his brain was busy with the tail-ends of a hundred scraps
  of plans. He was so busy wondering what might be happening to all the other
  men subordinate to him, who would have to be acting on their own initiative,
  that his own plans lacked something of directness. But there was no lack of
  decision, and no time was lost. The men marched, and marched their swiftest,
  in the dust-laden Indian heat. And he marched with them, in among them, and
  ate what the cook brought him, without a thought but for the best interests
  of the government he served.</p>

  <p>So they buried General Baines some eighty-and-twenty miles from Harumpore,
  and shot the cook. And, according to the easy Indian theology, the cook was
  wafted off to paradise, while General Baines betook himself to hell, or was
  betaken. But the column, three thousand perspiring Britons strong, continued
  marching, loaded down with haversacks and ammunition and resolve.</p>

  <p>It was met, long before the jackals had dug down to General Baines'
  remains, by the advance-guard of Colonel Kendrick's column, which was coming
  out of Harumpore because things were not brisk enough in that place to keep
  it busy. Kendrick himself was riding with the cavalry detachment that led the
  way southward.</p>

  <p>"Who's in command now?" he asked, for they had told him of General Baines'
  death by poison.</p>

  <p>"I am," said a gray-haired officer who rode up at that moment.</p>

  <p>"I'm your senior, sir, by two years," answered Kendrick.</p>

  <p>"Then you command, sir."</p>

  <p>"Very good. Enough time's been wasted. The column can wait here until my
  main body reaches us. Then we'll march at once on Jailpore. This idea of
  leaving Jailpore to its fate is nonsense! The rebels are in strength there,
  and they have perpetrated an abominable outrage. There we will punish them,
  or else we'll all die in the attempt! If we have to raze Jailpore to the
  ground, and put every man in it to the sword before we find the four
  Europeans supposed to be left alive there, our duty is none the less obvious!
  Here comes my column. Tell the men to be ready to march in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>He turned his horse, to look through the dust at the approaching column,
  but the man who had been superseded touched him on the sleeve.</p>

  <p>"What's that? Better have a rest? Tired out, you say? Oh! Form them all up
  in hollow square, then, and I'll say a few words to them. There are other
  ways of reviving a leg-weary column than by letting it lie down."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later a dull roar rose up through a steel-shot dust-cloud, and
  three thousand helmets whirled upward, flashing in the sun. Three thousand
  weary men had given him his answer! There was no kind of handle to it; no
  reserve&mdash;nothing but generous and unconditional allegiance unto hunger,
  thirst, pain, weariness, disease or death. It takes a real commander to draw
  that kind of answer from a tired-out column, but it is a kind of answer, too,
  that makes commanders! It is not mere talk, on either side. It means that by
  some sixth sense a strong man and his men have discovered something that is
  good in each other.</p>

  <h2><a name="chapA11"
     id="chapA11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You've made good time, friend Juggut Khan!" said Brown,
  advancing to meet him where the men and the fakir and the interpreter would
  not be able to Overhear.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I killed one horse&mdash;the horse you looted for me&mdash;and I
  brought away two from Bholat. One of them carried me more than fifty miles,
  and then I changed to this one, leaving the other on the road. I have orders
  for you, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Hand 'em over then," said Brown. "Orders first, and talk afterward, when
  there's time!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput drew out a sealed envelope, and passed it to him. Brown tore it
  open, and read the message, scowling at the half-sheet of paper as though it
  were a death-sentence.</p>

  <p>"Where's the general?"</p>

  <p>"With his column-twenty or thirty miles away to the northward by now!"</p>

  <p>"And he's left me, with this handful, in the lurch?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! As I understood the orders, he has left you with a very
  honorable mission to fulfil!"</p>

  <p>Brown stared hard at the half-sheet of notepaper again. Reading was not
  his longest suit by any means, and at that he infinitely preferred to wrestle
  with printed characters.</p>

  <p>"Have you read it, Juggut Khan?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib. I can speak English, but not read it."</p>

  <p>"Then we're near to being in the same boat, we two!" said Brown with a
  grin. "I'll have another try! It looks like a good-by message to me&mdash;
  here's the word 'good-by' written at the end above his signature."</p>

  <p>"There were other matters, sahib. There was an order. I can not read, but
  I know what is in the message."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You, and your twelve&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nine!" corrected Brown.</p>

  <p>"Three dead?"</p>

  <p>Brown nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your nine, then, sahib, and you and I are to proceed immediately to
  Jailpore, and to gain an entrance if we can, rescue those whom I concealed
  there and bring them to Harumpore, or to the northward of Harumpore, wherever
  we can find the column."</p>

  <p>"Eleven men are to attempt that?"</p>

  <p>Brown was studying out the letter word by word, and discovering to his
  amazement that its purport was exactly what Juggut Khan pretended.</p>

  <p>"If there are no more than eleven of us, then yes, eleven! And, sahib,
  since you seem to hold at least an island here where a man may lie down
  unmolested, I propose to sleep for an hour or two, before proceeding. I have
  had no sleep since I left Jailpore."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort!" said Brown. "If we're to march on Jailpore, off we
  go at once! You can sleep on the road, my son! It's time we paid a visit to
  that village, I'm thinking. Those treacherous brutes need a lesson. I'd have
  been down there before, only I wanted to be in full view of the road in case
  anybody came looking for me from Bholat. We'll need a wagon for the fakir.
  You can sleep in it too."</p>

  <p>"Sleep with a fakir? I? Allah! I am a Rajput, sahib! A sergeant of the
  Rajput Horse, retired!"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't want to sleep with him myself!" admitted Brown. "Come and look
  at him. You can smell him from here, but the sight of him's the real
  thing!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput swaggered up beside Brown, after loosening his horse's girths
  and lifting the saddle for a moment.</p>

  <p>"He's not the only one that needs a drink!" said Brown. "We're all dry as
  brick-dust here, except the fakir!"</p>

  <p>"He must wait a while before he drinks. Show me the fakir. Why, Brown
  sahib, know you what you have there?"</p>

  <p>"The father of all the smells, and all the dirt and all the evil eyes and
  evil tongues in Asia!" Brown hazarded.</p>

  <p>"More than that, sahib! That is the nameless fakir&mdash;him whom they
  know as HE! Has there been no attempt made to rescue him?"</p>

  <p>"They rescued him once, and murdered three of my men to get him. When they
  tried again, I put a halter round his neck and he and I arranged a sort of
  temporary compromise."</p>

  <p>"And the terms of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's supposed to have performed a miracle.</p>

  <p>He made us unslip the halter, and fall down flat, and he's supposed to be
  keeping us by him, by a sort of spell, so's to give us something
  extra-special in the line of ghastly deaths at his own convenience. That way,
  I was able to wait for news from Bholat&mdash;see?"</p>

  <p>"You could have captured no more important prisoner than that, sahib, let
  me tell you! They believe him to be almost a god; so nearly one that the gods
  themselves obey his orders now and then! It was he, and no other, that told
  the men of Jailpore that he would make them impervious to bullets. If we have
  him, sahib, we have the key to Jailpore!"</p>

  <p>"We, have certainly got him," said Brown. "You can see him, and you can
  smell him. I'll order one of the men to prick him with a bayonet, if you want
  to hear him, too! I wouldn't feel him, if I were you!"</p>

  <p>"He must come, too, to Jailpore!"</p>

  <p>"Of course he comes!"</p>

  <p>"Then, sahib, let us move away from here to where there is water. There
  let us rest until sundown, and then march, in the cool of the evening. It
  will be better so. And of a truth I must sleep, or else drop dead from
  weariness."</p>

  <p>"Does that message put you in command?" asked Brown, a trifle
  truculently.</p>

  <p>"No, sahib! But it orders you to listen to my advice whenever
  possible."</p>

  <p>"That means that you are under my orders?"</p>

  <p>"That letter does not say so, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Very well, are you, or are you not?"</p>

  <p>"We are supposed to act in concert, sahib."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't say so in the letter! Yes, or no? Are you going to obey
  orders, or aren't you? In other words, are you coming with me, or do you stay
  behind?"</p>

  <p>"I come with you, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Then you obey my orders!"</p>

  <p>"But the letter says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That I'm to take your advice whenever possible! I don't need advice just
  at the moment, thanks! I've got orders here to march, and I'm off at once!
  You can please yourself whether you come with me or not, but if you come you
  come on my terms."</p>

  <p>"I go with you, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Under my orders?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"All right, Juggut Khan. Here's my hand on it. Now, we'll swoop down on
  that village, and take the fakir with us, with a halter round his neck for
  the sake of argument. We'll get two bullock-carts down there, and we'll stick
  him in one of them, with Sidiki the interpreter tied to him. Sidiki won't
  like it, but he's only a Beluchi anyway! You get in the other, and get all
  the sleep you can. You and I'll take turns sleeping all the way to Jailpore,
  so's to be fresh, both of us, and fit for anything by the time that we get
  there!"</p>

  <p>"I am ready, sahib."</p>

  <p>"You two men who carried old Stinkijink before, pick him up again!"
  shouted Brown. "Let him feel the bayonet if he makes a noise, but carry him
  gently as though you loved him. The rest&mdash;'Tshun! Form two-deep
  &mdash;on the center&mdash;close order, march. Ri' dress. Eyes front. Ri'
  turn. By the left&mdash;quick march."</p>

  <p>The Rajput strode beside Brown, wondering wearily whether it was worth his
  while to offer him advice or not, and keeping his tired eyes ever moving in
  the direction of the distant huts.</p>

  <p>"They have rifles, sahib?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Lots of 'em! Three that they took from my men, among others."</p>

  <p>"It would not be well to march into a trap at this stage."</p>

  <p>"As well now as later." "True, sahib! And my time has not come yet; I know
  it. Else had I died of weariness, as my horse did."</p>

  <p>Brown kept rigidly to that point of view in everything he did, from that
  time on until he reached Jailpore. He believed himself to be engaged on a
  forlorn hope that was so close to being an absolute impossibility as to be
  almost the same thing. He had no doubt whatever in his own mind but that his
  own death, and the death of those with him, was a matter now of hours, or
  possibly of minutes. His one resolute determination was to die, and make the
  others die, in a manner befitting their oath of service. He had orders, and
  he would pass them on according to his interpretation of them. He would obey
  his orders, and they theirs, and the rest was no business of his or
  anybody's.</p>

  <p>They put the fakir in a hut; where Juggut Khan&mdash;too weary for
  foraging&mdash;stood guard over him. When a crowd collected round the hut,
  and Juggut Khan applied the butt of a lighted cigarette to the tender skin
  between the fakir's shoulder-blades, the anxious fakir-worshipers were told
  that all was well. They were to let the white soldiers take two wagons, or
  three even, if they wanted them. They were to return to their houses at once,
  and hide, lest the devils who would shortly overwhelm the white men should
  make mistakes and include them, too, in the whelming. He, the fakir, intended
  to take the white men for a little journey along the road toward Jailpore,
  where the devils who would deal with them would have no opportunity to make
  mistakes. And, since the natives knew that Jailpore was a rebel stronghold,
  and that ten white men and a native would have no chance to do the slightest
  damage there, they chose to believe the fakir and to obey him.</p>

  <p>Hindus have as stubborn and unalterable a habit of obeying and believing
  their priests&mdash;when the fancy suits them&mdash;as white men of other
  religions have.</p>

  <p>If the fakir had told them through the doorway of the hut that he intended
  going with the white men in the direction of Bholat, they would most surely
  have prevented him. But it suited them very well indeed to have the white men
  killed elsewhere. It was not likely, but there might be a column on its way
  from Bholat now; and if that column came, and found the bones of British
  soldiers as well as a burned-out guard-house, vengeance would be dire and
  prompt. Between where they were and Jailpore, the white men could not
  possibly escape. And at Jailpore, if not sooner, they must surely die. So
  they believed the fakir, and retired to the seclusion of their houses.</p>

  <p>It was wonderful, of course, but no more wonderful than a thousand other
  happenings in '57. All laws of probability and general average were upset
  that year, when sixty thousand men held down an armed continent. Even
  stranger things were happening than that two bullock-carts should dawdle
  through a rebel-seething district in the direction of a plundered,
  blood-soaked rebel stronghold; stranger even than that on the foremost
  bullock-cart a lean and louse-infested fakir should be squatting, guarded by
  British soldiers, who marched on either hand; or that a Rajput, who could
  trace his birth from a thousand-year-long line of royal chieftains, should be
  sleeping in the bullock-cart behind, followed closely by a black charger with
  a British saddle on its back, which ate corn from the tail-board of the
  wagon; stranger things, even, than that a British sergeant should be marching
  last of all, with his stern eyes roving a little wildly but his jaw set firm
  and his tread as rigid and authoritative and abrupt as though he were
  marching to inspect accouterments.</p>

  <p>In more than a dozen places, about a dozen men were holding a fort against
  an army. They were using every wile and trick and dodge that ingenuity or
  inspiration could provide them with, and they were mostly contriving to hold
  out. But there were none who did anything more daring or more unusual than to
  march to the attack of a city, with a hostile fakir in the van, and nothing
  else but their eleven selves and their rifles to assist them. There is a
  tremendous difference between defending when you have to, and attacking when
  you might retire.</p>

  <h2><a name="chapA12"
     id="chapA12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There were many more causes than one that worked together to
  make possible the entry of Brown and his little force into Jailpore. They
  were brave men; they were more than brave and they held the ace of trumps, as
  Brown had stated, in the person of the fakir known as "He." But luck favored
  them as well, and but for luck they must have perished half a dozen
  times.</p>

  <p>They marched the whole of the first afternoon, and met no one. They only
  overtook little straggling parties of rebels, making one and all for
  Jailpore, who bolted at the sight of them, imagining them probably to be the
  advance-guard of a larger force. The very idiocy of marching eleven strong
  through a country infested by their enemies was in their favor. Nobody could
  believe that there were no more than eleven of them. Even the English could
  not be such lunatics!</p>

  <p>That night, they rested for a while, and then went on again. During the
  day following they lay in a hollow between some trees and rested, and slept
  by turns. They suffered agonies from the heat, and not a little from hunger,
  and once or twice they were hard put to it to stop the Rajput's charger from
  neighing when a native pony passed along the nearby road. But night came
  again, and with it the screen of darkness for their strange, almost
  defenseless caravan. Once or twice the fakir tried to shout an alarm to
  passing villagers, but the quick and energetic application of a cleaning-rod
  by Brown stopped him always in the nick of time, and they came within sight
  of the battlements of Jailpore without an accident.</p>

  <p>Then, though, their problem became really serious, and it was a series of
  circumstances altogether out of their control and not connected with them
  that made their entry possible. The mutineers in Jailpore had learned that
  Kendrick sahib was coming down on them from the north by forced marches with
  thirty-five hundred men or more. They were putting the place into a state of
  siege, and getting ready by all means in their power to oppose him.</p>

  <p>Little attention was being paid to small parties of arrivals from no man
  knew or cared where. And, in a final effort to find the four who were the
  lure that was bringing Kendrick down on them, the city was once more being
  turned upside down and inside out, and men were even being tortured who were
  thought to know of hiding-places.</p>

  <p>With purely Eastern logic, the leaders of the rebels had decided that the
  sight of the bodies of the four, writhing in their last agony on the sun-
  scorched outer wall, would mightily discourage the British when they came. So
  no efforts were being spared and no stones left unturned to find them. The
  hooks on the wall were sharp and ready, so that they might be impaled without
  loss of time in full view of their would-be rescuers.</p>

  <p>Almost every secret passage of the thousand odd had been explored. In the
  hurry to run through them and explore the next one, doors had been left open
  here and there that had been kept closed in some instances for centuries.</p>

  <p>One door in particular, placed cornerwise in a buttress of the outer wall,
  was spotted by Juggut Khan as he circled round the city on his charger at
  dusk on the day following their arrival. He brought his charger back to where
  the others lay concealed, and then went on an exploring-expedition on foot
  &mdash;to discover that the outer city wall was like a sponge, a nest of
  honey-combed cells and passages wandering interminably in the
  fifty-foot-thick brick and rubble rampart.</p>

  <p>And while he searched amid the mazy windings of the wall, Bill Brown sat
  in the forked top of a tree and studied out the ground-plan of the city. He
  was imprinting landmarks in his memory for future reference, and trying
  &mdash;with a brain that ached from the apparent hopelessness of the task
  &mdash;to figure out a plan.</p>

  <p>He knew by now that the four he had come to rescue were hidden underneath
  the powder-magazine, and he could see the magazine itself. But he could think
  of no way of rescuing them, for the city absolutely boiled with frantic,
  mixed-up castes and creeds picked at random, and thrown in at random from the
  whole of India. A mouse could not have passed through the streets undetected!
  And yet, from a soldier's point of view, there were certain fascinating
  details to be noticed about that powder-magazine. In the first place, it had
  been constructed for a granary by an emperor who never heard of Joseph, but
  who had the same ideal plan for cornering the people's food-supply. And since
  labor had been unlimited, and cheap, he had gone about building the thing on
  the most thoroughly unpractical and most pretentious plan that he and his
  architects could figure out. It was big enough to hold about ten times as
  much grain as the province could grow in any one year of plenty. And, since
  that was the least practical and most ungranary-like shape, he had caused it
  to be built like an enormous beehive, with a tiny platform at the top.</p>

  <p>Winding round and round the huge stone dome, and on the outside, was a
  six-foot-wide trail, which was the elevator. Up this, each with a sack or a
  basket on his head, the population was to have been induced to run in single
  file, dumping its hard-won corn into the granary through an opening at the
  top until the granary was full.</p>

  <p>The emperor died&mdash;by poison&mdash;before he could see his cherished
  project put into execution, but he had been a very thorough calculator, and a
  builder who believed in permanency. He had foreseen that when the granary was
  full, and the screw-jacks were turned beneath the cost of living, there would
  probably be efforts made by unwashed, untutored, unenlightened mobs to rape
  his storehouse. So he had made the little platform at the top a veritable
  fortress of a place, such as a handful of men could hold against a hundred
  thousand.</p>

  <p>There was no known entrance to the granary above ground, except on the
  ground level, where a huge stone gateway frowned above a teak-and-iron door.
  Above that door there were galleries, and fortalices and cunningly invented
  battlements in miniature, from behind whose shelter a resolute
  defending-party could pour out a hundred different kinds of death on a hungry
  crowd. The place was naturally fire-proof and naturally cool&mdash;as far as
  any building can be cool in Central India. It was a first-class, ideal
  powder-magazine, if useless as a granary; and the last new conquerors of
  India had hastened to adopt it as a means of storing up the explosive
  medicine with which they kept their foothold.</p>

  <p>Naturally, none but White soldiers, and a very few of the more trusted
  natives, had ever been allowed to go inside the powder-magazine. The secret
  passages beneath it had never been intended for public convenience or
  information. They had been designed as a means of rushing defenders secretly
  into the granary, and they connected with a tunnel underneath the palace that
  had just been burned. They also connected with the outer wall in such a way
  that defenders from the ramparts might be rushed there too, if wanted in a
  hurry. But, since there never had been corn kept in the granary, and nobody
  had ever had the slightest need to force an entrance, the knowledge even of
  the existence of the passages had become barely a memory, and there was not a
  man living in Jailpore who knew exactly where they began or where they ended.
  There was a man outside who knew, but none inside.</p>

  <p>The point about the powder-magazine which most appealed to Brown&mdash;
  next after his knowledge of its contents, mineral and human&mdash;was the
  fact that the little platform at its summit overlooked the city-wall, and
  that the side of the granary actually touched the wall on the side of the
  city farthest from where he sat and spied it out. Ten men on that protected
  platform, he thought, might suffer from the sun, but they could hold the
  building and command a good-sized section of the city ramparts against all
  comers.</p>

  <p>He noticed too, though that seemed immaterial at the time, that one well-
  aimed shot from heavy ordnance might crash through the upper dome and set off
  the powder underneath. There was no artillery that could be brought against
  the place, either with the British force or with the mutineers, but the
  thought set him to wondering how much powder there might be stored on the
  huge round floor below, and what would happen should it become ignited. It
  was a sanguinary, interesting, subtle kind of thought, that suited the
  condition of his brain exactly! He climbed down from the tree, feeling almost
  good-natured.</p>

  <p>At the bottom he met Juggut Khan, waiting for him patiently.</p>

  <p>"What have you seen, sahib?" he asked him. "Have you formed a plan?"</p>

  <p>"I've been wishing I was Joshua!" said Brown. "I'd like to make my men
  march round the city and blow trumpets, and then see the walls fall down. I
  can think of several things to do, if we could only get inside. But I can't
  think how to get there."</p>

  <p>"I have found a way in!" said Juggut Khan. "I have cross-questioned that
  fakir of ours as well, with a little assistance from a cleaning-rod wielded
  by one of your men. He knows the way too. He says he is the only man who
  knows it&mdash;in which he lies, since I too have discovered it. But his
  knowledge may help as well."</p>

  <p>"What's that about a cleaning-rod?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>"It was used on him to help him forget his vow of silence."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"When you were up that tree, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Have you been giving my man orders?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"How did he come to beat the fakir, then?"</p>

  <p>"We both arrived at the same conclusion at the same moment, and the fakir
  received the benefit!"</p>

  <p>"Who held him, you?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! God forbid! I am a clean man. I listened to his conversation.
  The Beluchi held him."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Well, I like you well enough, Juggut Khan, but there are things about
  you that I don't like. You're too fond of doing things on your own
  responsibility, and you're much too fond of using oaths. Y our soul is none
  o' my business; you're a heathen anyhow, and no longer in the Service. But,
  I'll trouble you not to use those disgraceful oaths of yours in the presence
  of the men! Do you understand me?"</p>

  <p>"I understand you, sahib. If my respect for all your other qualities were
  not so profound, I would laugh at you! As it is, if your honor should see fit
  to turn the bullocks loose, and tie the fakir fast between two men and follow
  me, it seems to me dark enough by now, and I know the way. Might I
  furthermore suggest that the ammunition-box would make a reasonable load for
  another two men?"</p>

  <p>"Hadn't we better bring our rifles too?" asked Brown sarcastically. "Upon
  my honor, Juggut Khan! You're getting childish! Are your nerves upset, or
  what? Lead on, man! Lead on!"</p>

  <p>"Listen. There are two ways, sahib. One way leads from the burned-out
  barracks to the cellar where the women lie hidden. That way is closed by
  debris. The other way leads from the outer wall by a very winding route to
  the cellar where the women are. The fakir knows that way, and I do not,
  though I know of it. There is a third way, though, that leads from the outer
  wall, where I have been exploring, straight almost, if you disregard a wind
  or two, to the inside of the powder-magazine. It enters the magazine through
  a doorway secretly contrived in an upright pillar&mdash;or so the fakir
  swears. Now this is my notion, sahib. If we go in by the lower way, we must
  come out that way, and run the risk of being caught as we emerge. That risk
  will be greatly enhanced when we have frightened women with us whose eyes
  have been blinded by the darkness. But, if we go in by the upper way, and
  enter the magazine itself, I can make the fakir show us how to lift the stone
  trapdoor I spoke of&mdash;the one that I closed when I hid the women. Then I
  can ascend with him, and with say four men, while you ascend to the platform
  at the top with the remainder of the men, and guard our rear and our exit.
  From the top, you will be able to see us as we emerge, and can cover our
  retreat, and follow."</p>

  <p>"That sounds like a roundabout sort of plan to me!" said Brown. "Why not
  go straight in by the lower route, and gather up the women, and carry 'em
  out, and make a bolt for it?"</p>

  <p>"Because, sahib, we will be at the fakir's mercy."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! He's at our mercy."</p>

  <p>"Think, sahib! There, he will be in his own bat's nest, so to speak. These
  fakirs are the only men who know the windings of all the secret passages.
  They are the rats of religion and intrigue. At any step he might lead us into
  an ambush, and we might be overwhelmed before we knew that we were attacked.
  If we go the other way, though, I can lead the way myself, and we need only
  take the fakir to show us how to open the door."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Brown. "Let's get a move on, though! I'm beginning to
  think that you're a better talker than a fighter, Juggut Khan!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib? I trust there will be no fighting!" But the Rajput smiled as
  he said it, and thought of a certain lance-shaft which had been broken in the
  streets of Jailpore.</p>

  <p>"Lead on! Fall in behind me, men! Walk quietly, now, and remember. Hold
  your tongues! Each man keep his eye on me, and a finger on the trigger!"</p>

  <p>The Beluchi and the fakir and Juggut Khan moved in the van, with two men
  to hold the fakir. Next marched, or rather tiptoed, Sergeant Brown, followed
  by the other men in single file. In that order they hastened after Juggut
  Khan, through the darkness, across a dried-out moat and round the corner of a
  huge stone buttress. There they disappeared inside the wall, and a stone
  swung round and closed the gap behind the last of them. There was no alarm
  given, and not a sign or a sound of any kind to betoken that any one had seen
  them. Inside the walls the city roared like a flood-fed maelstrom, and
  outside all was darkness and the silence of the dead.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapA13"
     id="chapA13">CHAPTER 13</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was some smart work done inside the powder-magazine.
  To be able to appreciate it properly one would be obliged to do what they
  did&mdash; wander through a maze of tunnels in a city-wall, blinded by
  darkness, oppressed by the stored-up stuffiness and heat of ages and deafened
  by the stillness&mdash;then emerge unexpectedly in the lamp-lit magazine,
  among mutineers who sprawled, and laughed; and chewed betel-nut at their ease
  upon the powder-kegs.</p>

  <p>Both sides were taken by surprise, but the mutineers had the nominal
  advantage, for their eyes were accustomed to the light. They had the
  advantage in numbers, too, by almost two to one. But they dared not fire, for
  fear of setting off the magazine, whereas Brown and his little force dared
  anything. They fully expected to die, and might as well die that way as any
  other. And a quick death for the women down below would be better than
  anything the rebels had in store for them. Brown yelled an order, and the
  rest was too quick, nearly, for the eye to follow.</p>

  <p>Three rebels died with bullets in them, and the rest stampeded for the
  teak-and-metal door, to find it locked on them, and Brown and the Rajput
  standing in front of it on guard. The mutineers attacked fiercely. They flung
  themselves all together on the two. But they had yet to learn that they were
  tackling, or endeavoring to tackle, the two finest swordsmen in that part of
  India. And when they turned, to find more room to fight in, or to draw their
  breath, they had to face nine bayonets that hemmed them in, and drove them
  closer and even closer to the swords again. They shouted, but no sound could
  pierce the walls or escape through that tremendous door. Even the sound of
  firing merely echoed upward until it reached the dome, and then filtered out
  and upward through the opening above. They might as well have shouted to
  their friends in Bholat!</p>

  <p>For ten minutes, perhaps, the battle surged and swayed on the stone floor
  first one side rushing, then the other. But man after man of the mutineers
  went down&mdash;appalled by the amazing swordsmanship, disheartened by the
  grim determination of their adversaries, bewildered to feebleness by the
  suddenness of the attack.</p>

  <p>Soon there were but eight of them facing the blood-wet steel, and then
  Brown shouted for a fresh formation, swung his contingent into line and led
  them with a rush across the floor that swept the remaining mutineers off
  their feet.</p>

  <p>Three more went down with steel through them, and then the rest
  surrendered, throwing down their arms, and begging mercy. Brown made a bundle
  of their arms, stowed it in a corner and made the prisoners stand together in
  a bunch, while he searched them thoroughly.</p>

  <p>"If we can't get that trapdoor open now, with these to help us," he
  remarked, panting and wiping the dotted blood off his sword on a Hindu
  prisoner's trousers, "it'll be a heavier proposition than I think!"</p>

  <p>"There's a trick to it," said Juggut Khan, panting too, for the battle had
  been fierce and furious while it lasted. "The fakir knows the trick. It is
  heavy, in any case. But, if we make him tell us, we can manage it."</p>

  <p>There followed delay while the fakir was induced to forego the pleasure of
  a sulking fit. He seemed like a child, anxious to emphasize their dependence
  on his knowledge, and needing to be recompelled to each new thing they needed
  of him. He was perfectly content, though, to surrender when he felt the
  weight of a cleaning-rod on his anatomy, or something in the way of fire
  &mdash;a match or cigarette for instance&mdash;placed where he would get the
  most sensation from it.</p>

  <p>Then followed more delay, while they rigged a lever of sorts, and a rope
  through an iron ring in the trap, and while Juggut Khan hunted for the secret
  catch that the fakir swore was hidden underneath a smaller stone that hinged
  in the middle of the floor. He found it at last, moved it and came across to
  lend a hand with the lever and the rope.</p>

  <p>The fakir sat still and smiled at them. His eyes gleamed more horridly
  than ever, and his withered arm seemed more than ever to be calling down dire
  vengeance on them.</p>

  <p>"I believe that monster is up to tricks of some kind!" swore Brown.</p>

  <p>"He can't do anything," said Juggut Khan. "If we were all to put our
  weight against this, all together, we and the prisoners, sahib, we could get
  it open in a second."</p>

  <p>"All together, then!" said Brown. "Come on, there! Lend a hand!"</p>

  <p>The prisoners and Brown's men and Juggut Khan and the Beluchi bent their
  backs above the lever, or hauled taut on the rope, and the fakir wriggled
  with some secret joke.</p>

  <p>"At the word three!" said Brown. "Then all together!"</p>

  <p>"One!"</p>

  <p>"Two!"</p>

  <p>The fakir writhed delightedly. He seemed more than ever like a wickedly
  malicious child.</p>

  <p>"Three!"</p>

  <p>They strained their utmost, and the huge stone trap gave way with a sudden
  jerk.</p>

  <p>"For the love of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They all jumped, but they were strained in the wrong position for a quick
  recovery, and the ten-ton rock rolled back on unseen hinges to crush them
  all, and rolled back and yet farther back&mdash;and then stayed! Brown had
  snatched a rifle, and had placed it between the rolling rock and the
  wall!</p>

  <p>He stood wiping the sweat from his forehead, while the rest recovered
  their lost balance and walked out from behind unscathed. The rifle creaked
  and bent and split. Then the stone leaned farther back, reached the wall and
  stayed there!</p>

  <p>"A near thing that!" said Brown. "That fakir's a bright beauty, isn't
  he!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I kick him, sir?" asked one of Brown's men.</p>

  <p>"Kick him? No! What good'd that do? What next, Juggut Khan?"</p>

  <p>But Juggut Khan was bending down, and listening at the hole laid bare by
  the huge hinged trap.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" commanded Brown.</p>

  <p>The men held their breath, even, but not a sound came up from the darkness
  down below.</p>

  <p>"Are they dead, d'you suppose?" asked Brown.</p>

  <p>And, even as he asked it, some one in the darkness snuffled, and he heard
  a woman's voice that moaned.</p>

  <p>"Snff-snff-snff! I wonder if I'm dead yet! I wouldn't be, I know, if Bill
  were here! He'd ha' got us out!"</p>

  <p>"There is one of them alive!" said Juggut Khan.</p>

  <p>"So I notice!" answered Brown, with a strange dry quaver in his voice. "Go
  down and bring her up, please! Take three or four men with you. It won't do
  to bring women and a child up here and let 'em see this awful fakir and these
  corpses. Take your time about bringing 'em up, while I make the prisoners
  carry their dead up on to the roof. I'll take the fakir up there too where
  he's out of mischief!"</p>

  <p>Just as a six-foot-wide pathway ran round and round the outside of the
  dome, another one, scarcely more than a yard wide, ran round the inside, and
  formed a roadway to the top in place of a stair. It took the prisoners and
  Brown's men fifteen minutes of continuous effort to carry up the dead and the
  fakir, and lay them on the roof.</p>

  <p>"Pitch the dead over!" ordered Brown, and the mutineers obeyed.</p>

  <p>"I've a mind to pitch you over too!" he growled at the fakir, and the
  strange creature seemed to understand him, for his eyes changed from their
  baleful hatred to a look of fear.</p>

  <p>The bodies slid and rolled down the rounded roof, and fell with a thud
  against the battlements, or else went rolling down the circular causeway that
  led to the street below.</p>

  <p>Brown seemed to be garnering ideas from watching them. He gazed down at
  the noisy tumult of the city, watching for a while the efforts of an ill-
  directed crowd to put out a fire that blazed in a distant quarter of the
  bazaar.</p>

  <p>There seemed to him something strangely preconcerted about much of the
  hurrying to and fro below him. It struck him as being far too orderly to be
  the mere boiling of a loot-crazed mob.</p>

  <p>His prisoners gave the secret to him. They were leaning against the
  parapet on the other side&mdash;the side closest to the city-wall, and
  farthest from the top of the causeway&mdash;and they were chattering together
  excitedly in undertones. Brown walked round to where they stood, and stared
  where they stared. Just as they had done, he recognized what lay below
  him.</p>

  <p>It was faintly outlined in the blackness, picked out here and there by
  lanterns, and still too far away for most civilians to name it until the sun
  rose and showed its detail. But Brown, the soldier, knew on the instant, and
  so did his men.</p>

  <p>Suddenly and unexpectedly and sweetly, like a voice in the night that
  spoke of hope and strength and the rebirth of order out of chaos, a bugle
  gave tongue from where the lanterns swung in straight-kept lines.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Juggut Khan! Oh, Juggut Khan!"</p>

  <p>Bill Brown's voice boomed through the opening in the dome, and spread down
  the walls of the powder-magazine as though in the inside of a speaking-
  trumpet.</p>

  <p>"Brown sahib?"</p>

  <p>"The army has got here from the north! It has come down here from
  Harumpore! It's outside the walls now, lying on its arms, and evidently
  waiting to attack at daylight!"</p>

  <p>"I, too, have news, Brown sahib! All four are living! All four lie here on
  the floor of the magazine, and they recover rapidly. They are all but strong
  enough to stand."</p>

  <p>"Good! Then come up here, Juggut Khan!"</p>

  <p>That winding pathway up the inside of the dome took longer to negotiate
  than an ordinary stairway would have done, but presently the Rajput leaned
  against the parapet and panted beside Brown.</p>

  <p>"D'you see them? There they are! Now, look on this side! D'you see the
  preparations going on? D'you realize what the next thing's going to be?
  They'll come for powder for the guns, so's to have it all ready for the
  gun-crews when the fun begins at dawn! Listen! Here they are already!"</p>

  <p>A thundering had started on the great teak door below&mdash;a thundering
  that echoed through the dome like the reverberations of an earthquake. It was
  punctuated by the screams of women. The prisoners changed their attitude, and
  eyed Brown and the Rajput with an air of truculence again.</p>

  <p>"They'll be up this causeway in a minute, sahib! Listen. There! They've
  seen the dead bodies that you tossed over. Better it had been to keep them up
  here for a while."</p>

  <p>"Never mind! We can hold this causeway until morning! Men! Take close
  order. Line up at the causeway-entrance. Kneel. Prepare for volley-firing.
  Now, let 'em come!"</p>

  <p>"I am for making an immediate escape, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!" said Brown, almost dreamily.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be thinking hard on some other subject as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, one of the women there&mdash;she who is maid to the other two
  &mdash;asked me where Bill Brown might be! She swore to me that she had
  recognized his voice when the trapdoor opened up above her. Are you not Bill
  Brown?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm William Brown!"</p>

  <p>"Her name, she says, is Emmett!"</p>

  <p>"You don't surprise me, Juggut Khan! I thought I had recognized her voice.
  It seemed strangely familiar. Well&mdash;here come the rebels up the
  causeway. See? They're at the bottom now with lanterns! Ready, men!"</p>

  <p>There came the answering click of breech-bolts, and a little rustling as
  each man eased his position, and laid his elbow on his knee.</p>

  <p>"Can you find your way out through the way we came, Juggut Khan?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I can!"</p>

  <p>"Are all the women on the floor?"</p>

  <p>"Three women and the child."</p>

  <p>"Can you close the trap-door again?"</p>

  <p>"Surely! It is only opening it that is difficult."</p>

  <p>"Then close it before you go. I've got a reason! Send one of my men up
  here with a lantern&mdash;one of those that are burning in the magazine. I
  want to signal."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Then take the women, with four of my men to help them walk, and get out
  as quickly as you can by the way we all came in. Wait for the rest of my men
  when you reach the opening in the outer wall, and when they reach you allot
  two men to carry each woman, and run&mdash;the whole lot of you&mdash;for the
  army over yonder. One of the women will object. She will want to see me
  first. Use force, if necessary!"</p>

  <p>"Are you, then, not coming, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I have another plan. Here they come! Hurry now, be off with the women!
  Volley-firing&mdash;ready&mdash;present!"</p>

  <p>Pattering footsteps sounded on the causeway, and a little crowd of nearly
  doubled figures came up it at a run.</p>

  <p>"Fire!"</p>

  <p>The volley took the rebels absolutely by surprise, and no man could miss
  his mark at that short range. Five of the rebels fell back headlong, and the
  rest, who followed up the causeway, turned on their heels and ran.</p>

  <p>"'Bout turn!" Brown shouted suddenly. "Use the steel, men! Use the
  steel!"</p>

  <p>His own sword was flashing, and lunging as he spoke, and he had already
  checked a sudden rush by the prisoners.</p>

  <p>They had thought the moment favorable for joining in the scrimmage from
  the rear.</p>

  <p>"All right! That'll do them! I'll attend to 'em now!"</p>

  <p>A man came running up with the lantern Brown had asked for, and Brown took
  it and began waving it above his head.</p>

  <p>"They must have heard that volley!" he muttered to himself. "Ah! There's
  the answer!"</p>

  <p>A red light began to dance over in the British camp, moving up and down
  and sidewise in sudden little jerks. Brown read the jerks, as he could never
  have read writing, and a moment later he answered them.</p>

  <p>"Now, down below, the lot of you! Give me your rifle, you. I'll need
  it."</p>

  <p>"Not coming, sir."</p>

  <p>"Not yet. There's something else yet, and I can do it best. Besides, some
  one has got to guard the causeway still. There might be a rush again at any
  minute. Listen now. Obey Juggut Khan implicitly as soon as you get down. His
  orders are my orders. Understand? Very well, then. And you without a weapon,
  your job is to shut the door that you leave the magazine by tight from the
  outside&mdash;d'you understand me? Call up when you're all through the door,
  and then shut it tight!"</p>

  <p>"But, how'll you get out, sir?"</p>

  <p>"That's my business. One minute, though. Here they come again. Get ready
  to fire another volley!"</p>

  <p>The mutineers made another and a more determined rush up the causeway,
  coming up it more than twenty strong, and at the double. Brown let one volley
  loose in the midst of them, then led his men at the charge down on them and
  drove them over the edge of the causeway by dint of sheer impact and cold
  steel. Not one of them reached the ground alive, and in the darkness it must
  have been impossible for the mutineers below to divine how many were the
  granary's defenders.</p>

  <p>"That'll keep 'em quiet for a while, I'll wager! Now, quick, you men! Get
  down below, and follow Juggut Khan, and don't forget to shut the door tight
  on you. These prisoners here are going to follow you&mdash;they may as well
  go down with you for that matter. No! that won't do. They could open the door
  below, couldn't they? They'll have to stay up here. Got any rope? Then bind
  them, somebody. Bind their hands and feet. Now, off with you!"</p>

  <p>Brown spent the next few minutes signaling with the lantern, and reading
  answering flashes that zig-zagged in the velvet blackness of the British
  lines. Then, as a voice boomed up through the granary, "All's well, sir! I'm
  just about to shut the door!" he fixed his eyes on the fakir, and laughed at
  him.</p>

  <p>"You and I are going to turn in our accounts of how we've worked out this
  'Hookum hai' business, my friend!" he told him. "You've given orders, and
  I've obeyed orders! We've both accounted for a death or two, and we've both
  accepted responsibility. We're going to know in less than five minutes from
  now which of us two was justified. There's one thing I know, though, without
  asking. There's one person, and she a woman, who'll weep for me. Will anybody
  weep for you, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>A lantern waved wildly from the British camp, and Brown seized his own
  lantern and signaled an answer.</p>

  <p>"See that? That's to say, you glassy-eyed horror you, that our mutual
  friend Juggut Khan has been seen emerging like a rat from a hole in the wall.
  I'll give him and his party one more minute to get clear. Then there's going
  to be a holocaust, my friend!"</p>

  <p>He cocked his rifle, and examined the breech-bolt and the foresight
  carefully. The fakir shuddered, evidently thinking that the charge was
  intended for himself.</p>

  <p>"No! It won't be that way. I know a better! I'm taking a leaf from your
  book and doing harm by wholesale!"</p>

  <p>Brown leaned down into the opening of the dome, and brought the rifle to
  his shoulder. There was a chorus of yells from the prisoners, and a noise
  like a wounded horse's scream from the fakir. The rest were bound, but the
  fakir rose and writhed toward him on his heels, with his sound arm stretched
  up in an attitude of despair beside the withered one.</p>

  <p>A chorus of bugles burst out from the British camp, and a volley ripped
  through the blackness.</p>

  <p>"All right! Here goes!" said Brown. And he aimed down into the shadowy
  powder-magazine, and pulled the trigger.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, an army three thousand and five hundred strong marched
  in through the gap made in the outer wall by a granary that had spread itself
  through&mdash;and not over&mdash;what was in its way. There were seventeen
  tons of powder that responded to the invitation of Brown's bullet.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapA14"
     id="chapA14">CHAPTER 14</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Explosions are among the few things&mdash;or the many
  things, whichever way you like to look at it!&mdash;that science can not
  undertake to harness or account for. When a gun blows up, or a
  powder-magazine, the shock kills whom it kills, as when a shell bursts in a
  dense-packed firing-line. You can not kill any man before his time comes,
  even if a thousand tons of solid masonry combine with you to whelm him, and
  go hurtling through the air with him to absolutely obvious destruction.</p>

  <p>The fakir's time had come, and the prisoners' time had come. But Sergeant
  William Brown's had not.</p>

  <p>They found him, blackened by powder, and with every stitch of clothing
  blown from him, clinging to a bunch of lotus-stems in a temple-pond. There
  was a piece of fakir in the water with him, and about a ton of broken
  granary, besides the remnants of a rifle and other proof that he had come
  belched out of a holocaust. The men who came on him had given their officer
  the slip, and were bent on a private looting-expedition of their own. But by
  the time that they had dragged him from the water, and he had looted them of
  wherewithal to clothe himself, their thoughts of plunder had departed from
  them. Brown had a way of quite monopolizing people's thoughts!</p>

  <p>There were twenty of them, and he led them all that night, and all through
  the morning and the afternoon that followed. He held them together and worked
  them and wheeled them and coached and cheered and compelled them through the
  hell-tumult of the ghastliest thing there is beneath the dome of heaven
  &mdash;house-to-house fighting in an Eastern city. And at the end of it, when
  the bugles blew at last "Cease fire," and many of the men were marched away
  by companies to put out the conflagrations that were blazing here and there,
  he led them outside the city-wall, stood them at ease in their own line and
  saluted their commanding-officer.</p>

  <p>"Twenty men of yours, sir. Present and correct."</p>

  <p>"Which twenty?"</p>

  <p>"Of Mr. Blair's half-company."</p>

  <p>"Where's Mr. Blair?"</p>

  <p>"Dunno, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Since when have you had charge of them?"</p>

  <p>"Since they broke into the city yesterday, sir."</p>

  <p>"And you haven't lost a man?"</p>

  <p>"Had lots of luck, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Who are you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Sergeant Brown, sir."</p>

  <p>"Of the Rifles?"</p>

  <p>"Of the Rifles, sir."</p>

  <p>"Were you the man who signaled to us from the magazine and blew it up and
  made the breach in the wall for us to enter by?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Are you alive, or dead? Man or ghost?"</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty much alive, sir, thank you!"</p>

  <p>"D'you realize that you made the taking of Jailpore possible? That but for
  you we'd have been trying still to storm the walls without artillery?"</p>

  <p>"I had the chance, sir, and I only did what any other man would ha' done
  under like circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Go and tell that to the Horse Marines&mdash;or, rather, tell it to
  Colonel Kendrick! Go and report to him at once. Possibly he'll see it through
  your eyes!"</p>

  <p>So Brown marched off to report himself, and he found Colonel Kendrick
  nursing a badly wounded arm before a torn and mud-stained tent.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" said the colonel, as Brown saluted him.</p>

  <p>"I'm Sergeant Brown, sir."</p>

  <p>"Not Bill Brown of the Rifles?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>"You lie! He was blown up on the roof of the powder-magazine! I suppose
  every man who's gone mad from the heat will be saying that he's Brown!"</p>

  <p>"I'm Brown, sir! I had written orders from General Baines to enter
  Jailpore and rescue three women and a child."</p>

  <p>"Where are your orders?"</p>

  <p>"Lost 'em, sir, in the explosion."</p>

  <p>"For a madman, you're a circumstantial liar! What happened to the
  women?"</p>

  <p>The colonel sat back, and smothered an exclamation of agony as the nerves
  in his injured arm tortured him afresh. He had asked a question which should
  settle once and for all this man's pretentions, and he waited for the answer
  with an air of certainty. It was on his lips to call the guard to take the
  lunatic away.</p>

  <p>"Juggut Khan, the Rajput, took them, with nine of my men, and brought them
  in to your camp last night, sir. I naturally haven't seen them since."</p>

  <p>"Will the women know you?"</p>

  <p>"One of them will, sir."</p>

  <p>"Which one?"</p>

  <p>"Jane Emmett, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll see!"</p>

  <p>The colonel called an orderly, and sent the orderly running for Jane
  Emmett. A minute later two strong arms were thrown round Bill Brown from
  behind, and he was all but carried off his feet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill&mdash;Bill&mdash;Bill! I knew you'd be all right! Turn round,
  Bill! Look at me!"</p>

  <p>She was clinging to him in such a manner that he could not turn, but he
  managed to pry her hands loose, and to draw her round in front of him.</p>

  <p>"I knew, Bill! I felt sure you'd come! And I recognized your voice the
  minute that the trapdoor opened and I heard it! I did, Bill! I knew you in a
  minute! I didn't worry then! I knew you wouldn't come and talk to me as long
  as there was any duty to be done. I just waited! They said you were killed in
  the explosion, but I knew you weren't! I knew it! I did! I knew it!"</p>

  <p>"Face me, please!" said Colonel Kendrick. "Now, Jane Emmett, is that man
  Sergeant William Brown, of the Rifles?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Is he the man who entered Jailpore with nine men and a Rajput, and came
  to your assistance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir! He's the same man who spoke in the powder-magazine;" '</p>

  <p>"Do you confirm that?" he asked Brown.</p>

  <p>"Under favor, sir, my men must be somewhere, if they're not all killed.
  They'll recognize me. And there's the other lot I led all last night and all
  today. They'll tell you where they found me!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind! I've decided I believe you! D'you realize that you're
  something of a marvel?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;except that I've had marvelous luck!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I shall take great pleasure in mentioning your name in despatches.
  It will go direct, at first hand, to Her Majesty the Queen! There are few
  men, let me tell you, Sergeant Brown, who would dare what you dared in the
  first place. But, more than that, there are even fewer men who would leave a
  sweetheart in some one else's care while they blew up a powder-magazine with
  themselves on top of it, in order to make a breach for the army to come in
  by! My right hand's out of action unfortunately&mdash;you'll have to shake my
  left!"</p>

  <p>The colonel rose, held his uninjured hand out and Brown shook it, since he
  was ordered to.</p>

  <p>"I consider it an honor and a privilege to have shaken hands with you,
  Sergeant Brown!" said Colonel Kendrick.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir!" said Brown, taking one step back, and then saluting.
  "May I join my regiment, sir?"</p>

  <p>He joined his regiment, when he had helped to sort out the bleeding
  remnants of it from among the by-ways and back alleys of Jailpore. And the
  chaplain married him and Jane Emmett out of hand. He sent her off at once
  with her former mistress to the coast, and marched off with his regiment to
  Delphi. And at Delphi his name was once more mentioned in despatches.</p>

  <p>When the Mutiny was over, and the country had settled down again to peace
  and reincarnation of a nation had begun, Brown found himself hoisted to a
  civil appointment that was greater and more highly paid than anything his
  modest soul had ever dreamed of.</p>

  <p>He never understood the reason for it, although he did his fighting-best
  consistently to fill the job; and he never understood why Queen Victoria
  should have taken the trouble to write a letter to him in which she thanked
  him personally, nor why they should have singled out for praise and special
  notice a fellow who had merely done his duty.</p>

  <p>Perhaps that was the reason why he was such a conspicuous success in civil
  life. They still talk of how Bill Brown, with Jane his wife and Juggut Khan
  the Rajput to advise him, was Resident Political Adviser to a Maharajah, and
  of how the Maharajah loathed him, and looked sidewise at him&mdash;but
  obeyed. That, though, is not a war-story. It is a story of the saving of a
  war, and shall go on record, some day, beneath a title of its own.</p>

  <h2><a name="Prologue"
     id="Prologue">PROLOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">To the northward of Hanadra, blue in the sweltering heat-
  haze, lay Siroeh, walled in with sun-baked mud and listless. Through a wooden
  gate at one end of the village filed a string of women with their water-pots.
  Oxen, tethered underneath the thatched eaves or by the thirsty-looking trees,
  lay chewing the cud, almost too lazy to flick the flies away. Even the
  village goats seemed overcome with lassitude. Here and there a pariah dog
  sneaked in and out among the shadows or lay and licked his sores beside an
  offal-heap; but there seemed to be no energy in anything. The bone-dry,
  hot-weather wind had shriveled up verdure and ambition together.</p>

  <p>But in the mud-walled cottages, where men were wont to doze through the
  long, hot days, there were murmurings and restless movement. Men lay on
  thong-strung beds, and talked instead of dreaming, and the women listened
  and said nothing&mdash;which is the reverse of custom. Hanadra was what it
  always had been, thatched, sun-baked lassitude; but underneath the thatch
  there thrummed a beehive atmosphere of tension.</p>

  <p>In the center of the village, where the one main road that led from the
  main gate came to an abrupt end at a low mud wall, stood a house that was
  larger than the others and somewhat more neatly kept; there had been an
  effort made at sweeping the enclosure that surrounded it on all four sides,
  and there was even whitewash, peeling off in places but still comparatively
  white, smeared on the sun-cracked walls.</p>

  <p>Here, besides murmurings and movement, there was evidence of real
  activity. Tethered against the wall on one side of the house stood a row of
  horses, saddled and bridled and bearing evidence of having traveled through
  the heat; through the open doorway the sunshine glinted on a sword-hilt and
  amid the sound of many voices rang the jingling of a spur as some one sat
  cornerwise on a wooden table and struck his toe restlessly against the
  leg.</p>

  <p>Another string of women started for the water-hole, with their picturesque
  brass jars perched at varying angles on their heads; and as each one passed
  the doorway of this larger house she turned and scowled. A Rajput, lean and
  black-bearded and swaggering, came to the door and watched them, standing
  proudly with his arms folded across his breast. As the last woman showed her
  teeth at him, he laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"Nay!" said a voice inside. "Have done with that! Is noticing the Hindu
  women fit sport for a Rajput?"</p>

  <p>The youngster turned and faced the old, black-bearded veteran who
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"If I had my way," he answered, "I would ride roughshod through this
  village, and fire the thatch. They fail to realize the honor that we pay them
  by a visit!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, hothead! And burn thy brother's barn with what is in it! The Hindus
  here are many, and we are few, and there will be burnings and saberings a-
  plenty before a week is past, if I read the signs aright! Once before have I
  heard such murmurings. Once before I have seen chapattis sent from house to
  house at sunset&mdash;and that time blood ran red along the roadside for a
  month to follow! Keep thy sword sharp a while and wait the day!"</p>

  <p>"But why," growled another deep-throated Rajput voice, "does the Sirkar
  wait? Why not smite first and swiftly?"</p>

  <p>Mahommed Khan moved restlessly and ran his fingers through his beard.</p>

  <p>"I know not!" he answered. "In the days when I was Risaldar in the Rajput
  Horse, and Bellairs sahib was colonel, things were different! But we
  conquered, and after conquest came security. The English have grown
  overconfident; they think that Moslem will always war with Hindu, the one
  betraying the other; they will not understand that this lies deeper than
  jealousy&mdash;they will not listen! Six months ago I rode to Jundhra and
  whispered to the general sahib what I thought; but he laughed back at me. He
  said 'Wolf! wolf!' to me and drew me inside his bungalow and bade me eat my
  fill."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what matters it! This land has always been the playground of
  new conquerors!"</p>

  <p>"There will be no new conquerors," growled the old Risaldar, "so long as I
  and mine have swords to wield for the Raj!"</p>

  <p>"But what have the English done for thee or us?"</p>

  <p>"This, forgetful one! They have treated us with honor, as surely no other
  conquerors had done! At thy age, I too measured my happiness in cattle and
  coin and women, but then came Bellairs sahib, and raised the Rajput Horse,
  and I enlisted. What came of that was better than all the wealth of Ind!"</p>

  <p>He spread his long legs like a pair of scissors and caught a child between
  them and lifted him.</p>

  <p>"Thou ruffian, thou!" he chuckled. "See how he fights! A true Rajput! Nay,
  beat me not. Some day thou too shalt bear a sword for England, great-
  grandson mine. Ai-ee! But I grow old."</p>

  <p>"For England or the next one!"</p>

  <p>"Nay! But for England!" said the Risaldar, setting the child down on his
  knee. "And thou too, hot-head. Before a week is past! Think you I called my
  sons and grandsons all together for the fun of it? Think you I rode here
  through the heat because I needed the exercise or to chatter like an ape or
  to stand in the doorway making faces at a Hindu woman or to watch thee do it?
  Here I am, and here I stay until yet more news comes!"</p>

  <p>"Then are we to wait here? Are we to swelter in Siroeh, eating up our
  brother's hospitality, until thy messengers see fit to come and tell us that
  this scare of thine is past?"</p>

  <p>"Nay!" said the Risaldar. "I said that I wait here! Return now to your own
  homes, each of you. But be in readiness. I am old, but I can ride still. I
  can round you up. Has any a better horse than mine? If he has, let him make
  exchange."</p>

  <p>"There will be horses for the looting if this revolt of thine breaks
  out!"</p>

  <p>"True! There will be horses for the looting! Well, I wait here then and,
  when the trouble comes, I can count on thirteen of my blood to carry swords
  behind me?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, when the trouble comes!"</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of assent, and the Risaldar arose to let his sons and
  grandsons file past him. He, who had beggared himself to give each one of
  them a start in life, felt a little chagrined that they should now refuse to
  exchange horses with him; but his eye glistened none the less at the sight of
  their stalwart frames and at the thought of what a fighting unit he could
  bring to serve the Raj.</p>

  <p>"All, then, for England!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Nay, all for thee!" said his eldest-born. "We fight on whichever side
  thou sayest!"</p>

  <p>"Disloyal one!" growled the Risaldar with a scowl. But he grinned into his
  beard.</p>

  <p>"Well, to your homes, then&mdash;but be ready!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chapB1"
     id="chapB1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The midnight jackals howled their discontent while heat-
  cracked India writhed in stuffy torment that was only one degree less than
  unendurable. Through the stillness and the blackness of the night came every
  now and then the high-pitched undulating wails of women, that no one
  answered-for, under that Tophet-lid of blackness, punctured by the low-hung,
  steel-white stars, men neither knew nor cared whose child had died. Life and
  hell-hot torture and indifference&mdash;all three were one.</p>

  <p>There was no moon, nothing to make the inferno visible, except that here
  and there an oil lamp on some housetop glowed like a blood-spot against the
  blackness. It was a sensation, rather than sight or sound, that betrayed the
  neighborhood of thousands upon thousands of human beings, sprawling,
  writhing, twisting upon the roofs, in restless suffering.</p>

  <p>There was no pity in the dry, black vault of heaven, nor in the bone-dry
  earth, nor in the hearts of men, during that hot weather of '57. Men waited
  for the threatened wrath to come and writhed and held their tongues. And
  while they waited in sullen Asiatic patience, through the restless silence
  and the smell&mdash;the suffocating, spice-fed, filth-begotten smell of
  India&mdash;there ran an undercurrent of even deeper mystery than India had
  ever known.</p>

  <p>Priest-ridden Hanadra, that had seen the downfall of a hundred kings,
  watched through heat-wearied eyes for another whelming the blood-soaked,
  sudden flood that was to burst the dam of servitude and rid India of her
  latest horde of conquerors. But eight hundred yards from where her high brick
  walls lifted their age-scars in the stifling reek, gun-chains jingled in a
  courtyard, and, sharp-clicking on age-old flagstones, rose the ring of
  horses' feet.</p>

  <p>Section Number One of a troop of Bengal Horse Artillery was waiting under
  arms. Sabered and grim and ready stood fifty of the finest men that England
  could produce, each man at his horse's head; and blacker even than the night
  loomed the long twelve-pounders, in tow behind their limbers. Sometimes a
  trace-chain jingled as a wheel-horse twitched his flank; and sometimes a man
  spoke in a low voice, or a horse stamped on the pavement; but they seemed
  like black graven images of war-gods, half-smothered in the reeking darkness.
  And above them, from a window that overlooked the courtyard, shone a solitary
  lamp that glistened here and there upon the sleek black guns and flickered on
  the saber-hilts, and deepened the already dead-black atmosphere of
  mystery.</p>

  <p>From the room above, where the lamp shone behind gauze curtains came the
  sound of voices; and in the deepest, death-darkest shadow of the door below
  there stood a man on guard whose fingers clutched his sword-hilt and whose
  breath came heavily. He stood motionless, save for his heaving breast;
  between his fierce, black mustache and his up-brushed, two-pointed beard, his
  white teeth showed through parted lips. But he gave no other sign that he was
  not some Rajput princeling's image carved out of the night.</p>

  <p>He was an old man, though, for all his straight back and military
  carriage. The night concealed his shabbiness; but it failed to hide the
  medals on his breast, one bronze, one silver, that told of campaigns already
  a generation gone. And his patience was another sign of age; a younger man of
  his blood and training would have been pacing to and fro instead of standing
  still.</p>

  <p>He stood still even when footsteps resounded on the winding stair above
  and a saber-ferrule clanked from step to step. The gunners heard and stood
  squarely to their horses. There was a rustling and a sound of shifting feet,
  and, a "Whoa,&mdash;you!" to an irritated horse; but the Rajput stayed
  motionless until the footsteps reached the door. Then he took one step
  forward, faced about and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Bellairs sahib!" boomed his deep-throated voice, and Lieutenant
  Bellairs stepped back with a start into the doorway again&mdash;one hand on
  his sword-hilt. The Indian moved sidewise to where the lamplight from the
  room above could fall upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Bellairs sahib!" he boomed again.</p>

  <p>Then the lieutenant recognized him.</p>

  <p>"You, Mahommed Khan!" he exclaimed. "You old war-dog, what brought you
  here? Heavens, how you startled me! What good wind brought you?"</p>

  <p>"Nay! It seems it was an ill wind, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"What ill wind? I'm glad to see you!"</p>

  <p>"The breath of rumor, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"What rumor brought you?"</p>

  <p>"Where a man's honor lies, there is he, in the hour of danger! Is all well
  with the Raj, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"With the Raj? How d'you mean, Risaldar?"</p>

  <p>Mahommed Khan pointed to the waiting guns and smiled.</p>

  <p>"In my days, sahib," he answered, "men seldom exercised the guns at
  night!"</p>

  <p>"I received orders more than three hours ago to bring my section in to
  Jundhra immediately&mdash;immediately&mdash;and not a word of
  explanation!"</p>

  <p>"Orders, sahib? And you wait?"</p>

  <p>"They seem to have forgotten that I'm married, and by the same token, so
  do you! What else could I do but wait? My wife can't ride with the section;
  she isn't strong enough, for one thing; and besides, there's no knowing what
  this order means; there might be trouble to face of some kind. I've sent into
  Hanadra to try to drum up an escort for her and I'm waiting here until it
  comes."</p>

  <p>The Risaldar stroked at his beard reflectively.</p>

  <p>"We of the service, sahib," he answered, "obey orders at the gallop when
  they come. When orders come to ride, we ride!"'</p>

  <p>Bellairs winced at the thrust.</p>

  <p>"That's all very fine, Risaldar. But how about my wife? What's going to
  happen to her, if I leave her here alone and unprotected?"</p>

  <p>"Or to me, sahib? Is my sword-arm withered? Is my saber rusted home?"</p>

  <p>"You, old friend! D'you mean to tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar saluted him again.</p>

  <p>"Will you stay here and guard her?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! Being not so young as thou art, I know better!"</p>

  <p>"What in Tophet do you mean, Mahommed Khan?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, sahib,"&mdash;the Indian's voice was level and deep, but it
  vibrated strangely, and his eyes glowed as though war-lights were being born
  again behind them&mdash;"that not for nothing am I come! I heard what thy
  orders were and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How did you hear what my orders were?"</p>

  <p>"My half-brother came hurrying with the news, sahib. I hastened! My horse
  lies dead one kos from Hanadra here!"</p>

  <p>The lieutenant laughed.</p>

  <p>"At last, Mahommed? That poor old screw of yours? So he's dead at last,
  eh? So his time had come at last!"</p>

  <p>"We be not all rich men who serve the Raj!" said the Risaldar with
  dignity. "Ay, sahib, his time was come! And when our time comes may thou and
  I, sahib, die as he did, with our harness on! What said thy orders, sahib?
  Haste? Then yonder lies the road, through the archway!"</p>

  <p>"But, tell me, Risaldar, what brought you here in such a hurry?"</p>

  <p>"A poor old screw, sahib, whose time was come&mdash;even as thou hast
  said!"</p>

  <p>"Mahommed Khan, I'm sorry&mdash;very sorry, if I insulted you! I&mdash;
  I'm worried&mdash;I didn't stop to think. I&mdash;old friend,
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is forgotten, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me&mdash;what are these rumors you have heard?"</p>

  <p>"But one rumor, sahib-war! Uprising&mdash;revolution&mdash;treachery
&mdash;all India waits the word to rise, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Mutiny among the troops, and revolution north, south, east and west!"</p>

  <p>"Here, too, in Hanadra?"</p>

  <p>"Here, too, in Hanadra, sahib! Here they will be among the first to
  rise!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come! I can't believe that! How was it that my orders said nothing of
  it then?"</p>

  <p>"That, sahib, I know not&mdash;not having written out thy orders! I
  heard that thy orders came. I knew, as I have known this year past, what
  storm was brewing. I knew, too, that the heavenborn, thy wife, is here. I am
  thy servant, sahib, as I was thy father's servant&mdash;we serve one Queen;
  thy honor is my honor. Entrust thy memsahib to my keeping!"</p>

  <p>"You will guard her?"</p>

  <p>"I will bring her in to Jundhra!"</p>

  <p>"You alone?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! I, and my sons, and my sons' sons&mdash;thirteen men all
  told!"</p>

  <p>"That is good of you, Mahommed Khan. Where are your sons?"</p>

  <p>"Leagues from here, sahib. I must bring them. I need a horse."</p>

  <p>"And while you are gone?"</p>

  <p>"My half-brother, sahib&mdash;he is here for no other purpose&mdash;he
  will answer to me for her safety!"</p>

  <p>"All right, Mahommed Khan, and thank you! Take my second charger, if you
  care to; he is a little saddle-sore, but your light weight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sahib&mdash;listen! Between here and Siroeh, where my eldest-born and
  his three sons live, lie seven leagues. And on from there to Lungra, where
  the others live, are three more leagues. I need a horse this night!"</p>

  <p>"What need of thirteen men, Mahommed? You are sufficient by yourself,
  unless a rebellion breaks out. If it did, why, you and thirteen others would
  be swamped as surely as you alone!"</p>

  <p>"Thy father and I, sahib, rode through the guns at Dera thirteen strong!
  Alone, I am an old man&mdash;not without honor, but of little use; with
  twelve young blades behind me, though, these Hindu rabble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean, Mahommed Khan, that you think Hanadra here will
  rise?"</p>

  <p>"The moment you are gone, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Then, that settles it! The memsahib rides with me!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, listen, sahib! Of a truth, thou art a hot-head as thy father was
  before thee! Thus will it be better. If the heavenborn, thy wife, stays
  behind, these rabble here will think that the section rides out to exercise,
  because of the great heat of the sun by day; they will watch for its return,
  and wait for the parking of the guns before they put torch to the mine that
  they have laid!"</p>

  <p>"The mine? D'you mean they've&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who knows, sahib? But I speak in metaphor. When the guns are parked again
  and the horses stabled and the men asleep, the rabble, being many, might dare
  anything!"</p>

  <p>"You mean, you think that they&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean, sahib, that they will take no chances while they think the guns
  are likely to return!"</p>

  <p>"But, if I take the memsahib with me?"</p>

  <p>"They will know then, sahib, that the trap is open and the bird flown!
  Know you how fast news travels? Faster than the guns, Sahib! There will be an
  ambuscade, from which neither man, nor gun, nor horse, nor memsahib will
  escape!"</p>

  <p>"But if you follow later, it will mean the same thing! When they see you
  ride off on a spent horse, with twelve swords and the memsahib&mdash;d'you
  mean that they won't ambuscade you?"</p>

  <p>"They might, sahib&mdash;and again, they might not! Thirteen men and a
  woman ride faster than a section of artillery, and ride where the guns would
  jam hub-high against a tree-trunk! And thy orders, sahib&mdash;are thy
  orders nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Orders! Yes, confound it! But they know I'm married. They
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sahib, listen! When the news came to me I was at Siroeh, dangling a
  great-grandson on my knee. There were no orders, but it seemed the Raj had
  need of me. I rode! Thou, sahib, hast orders. I am here to guard thy wife
&mdash;my honor is thy honor&mdash;take thou the guns. Yonder lies the
  road!"</p>

  <p>The grim old warrior's voice thrilled with the throb of loyalty, as he
  stood erect and pointed to the shadowy archway through which the road wound
  to the plain beyond.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, I taught thy father how to use his sword! I nursed thee when thou
  wert little. Would I give three false counsel now? Ride, sahib&mdash;
  ride!"</p>

  <p>Bellairs turned away and looked at his charger, a big, brown Khaubuli
  stallion, named for the devil and true in temper and courage to his name; two
  men were holding him, ten paces off.</p>

  <p>"Such a horse I need this night, Sahib! Thy second charger can keep pace
  with the guns!"</p>

  <p>Bellairs gave a sudden order, and the men led the brute back into his
  stable.</p>

  <p>"Change the saddle to my second charger!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the Risaldar again, with hand outstretched.</p>

  <p>"I'm ashamed of myself, Mahommed Khan!" he said, with a vain attempt to
  smile. "I should have gone an hour ago! Please take my horse Shaitan, and
  make such disposition for my wife's safety as you see fit. Follow as and when
  you can; I trust you, and I shall be grateful to you whatever happens!"</p>

  <p>"Well spoken, Sahib! I knew thou wert a man! We who serve the Raj have
  neither sons, nor wives, nor sweethearts! Allah guard you, Sahib! The section
  waits&mdash;and the Service can not wait!"</p>

  <p>"One moment while I tell my wife!"</p>

  <p>"Halt, Sahib! Thou hast said good-by a thousand times! A woman's tears
&mdash;are they heart-meat for a soldier when the bits are champing? Nay!
  See, sahib; they bring thy second charger! Mount! I will bring thy wife to
  Jundhra for thee! The Service waits!"</p>

  <p>The lieutenant turned and mounted.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mahommed Khan!" he said. "I know you're right! Section!
  Prepare to mount!" he roared, and the stirrups rang in answer to him. "Mount!
  Good-by, Mahommed Khan! Good luck to you! Section, right! Trot, march!"</p>

  <p>With a crash and the clattering of iron shoes on stone the guns jingled
  off into the darkness, were swallowed by the gaping archway and rattled out
  on the plain.</p>

  <p>The Risaldar stood grimly where he was until the last hoof-beat and bump
  of gun-wheel had died away into the distance; then he turned and climbed the
  winding stairway to the room where the lamp still shone through gauzy
  curtains.</p>

  <p>On a dozen roof-tops, where men lay still and muttered, brown eyes
  followed the movements of the section and teeth that were betel-stained
  grinned hideously.</p>

  <p>From a nearby temple, tight-packed between a hundred crowded houses, came
  a wailing, high-pitched solo sung to Siva&mdash;the Destroyer. And as it
  died down to a quavering finish it was followed by a ghoulish laugh that
  echoed and reechoed off the age-old city-wall.</p>

  <p>Proud as a Royal Rajput&mdash;and there is nothing else on God's green
  earth that is even half as proud&mdash;true to his salt, and stout of heart
  even if he was trembling at the knees, Mahommed Khan, two-medal man and
  Risaldar, knocked twice on the door of Mrs. Bellairs' room, and entered.</p>

  <p>And away in the distance rose the red reflection of a fire ten leagues
  away. The Mutiny of '57 had blazed out of sullen mystery already, the sepoys
  were burning their barracks half-way on the road to Jundhra!</p>

  <p>And down below, to the shadow where the Risaldar had stood, crept a giant
  of a man who had no military bearing. He listened once, and sneaked into the
  deepest black within the doorway and crouched and waited.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapB2"
     id="chapB2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hanadra reeks of history, blood-soaked and mysterious.
  Temples piled on the site of olden temples; palaces where half-forgotten
  kings usurped the thrones of conquerors who came from God knows where to
  conquer older kings; roads built on the bones of conquered armies; houses and
  palaces and subterranean passages that no man living knows the end of and few
  even the beginning. Dark corridors and colonnades and hollow walls; roofs
  that have ears and peep-holes; floors that are undermined by secret stairs;
  trees that have swayed with the weight of rotting human skulls and have
  shimmered with the silken bannerets of emperors. Such is Hanadra,
  half-ruined, and surrounded by a wall that was age-old in the dawn of written
  history.</p>

  <p>Even its environs are mysterious; outside the walls, there are carven,
  gloomy palaces that once re-echoed to the tinkle of stringed instruments and
  the love-songs of some sultan's favorite&mdash;now fallen into ruins, or
  rebuilt to stable horses or shelter guns and stores and men; but eloquent in
  all their new-smeared whitewash, or in crumbling decay, of long-since dead
  intrigue. No places, those, for strong men to live alone in, where night-
  breezes whisper through forgotten passages and dry teak planking recreaks to
  the memory of dead men's footsteps.</p>

  <p>But strong men are not the only makings of an Empire, nor yet the only
  sufferers. Wherever the flag of England flies above a distant outpost or
  droops in the stagnant moisture of an Eastern swamp, there are the graves of
  England's women. The bones that quarreling jackals crunch among the
  tombstones&mdash;the peace along the clean-kept borderline&mdash;the
  pride of race and conquest and the cleaner pride of work well done, these are
  not man's only. Man does the work, but he is held to it and cheered on by the
  girl who loves him.</p>

  <p>And so, above a stone-flagged courtyard, in a room that once had echoed to
  the laughter of a sultan's favorite, it happened that an English girl of
  twenty-one was pacing back and forth. Through the open curtained window she
  had seen her husband lead his command out through the echoing archway to the
  plain beyond; she had heard his boyish voice bark out the command and had
  listened to the rumble of the gun-wheels dying in the distance&mdash;for
  the last time possibly. She knew, as many an English girl has known, that she
  was alone, one white woman amid a swarm of sullen Aryans, and that she must
  follow along the road the guns had taken, served and protected by nothing
  more than low-caste natives.</p>

  <p>And yet she was dry-eyed, and her chin was high; for they are a strange
  breed, these Anglo-Saxon women who follow the men they love to the lonely
  danger-zone. Ruth Bellairs could have felt no joy in her position; she had
  heard her husband growling his complaint at being forced to leave her, and
  she guessed what her danger was. Fear must have shrunk her heartbeats and
  loneliness have tried her courage. But there was an ayah in the room with
  her, a low-caste woman of the conquered race; and pride of country came to
  her assistance. She was firm-lipped and, to outward seeming, brave as she was
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>Even when the door resounded twice to the sharp blow of a saber-hilt, and
  the ayah's pock-marked ebony took on a shade of gray, she stood like a queen
  with an army at her back and neither blanched nor trembled.</p>

  <p>"Who is that, ayah?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>The ayah shrank into herself and showed the whites of her eyes and
  grinned, as a pariah dog might show its teeth&mdash;afraid, but scenting
  carrion.</p>

  <p>"Go and see!"</p>

  <p>The ayah shuddered and collapsed, babbling incoherencies and calling on a
  horde of long-neglected gods to witness she was innocent. She clutched
  strangely at her breast and used only one hand to drag her shawl around her
  face. While she babbled she glanced wild-eyed around the long, low-ceilinged
  room. Ruth Bellairs looked down at her pityingly and went to the door herself
  and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, memsahib!" boomed a deep voice from the darkness.</p>

  <p>Ruth Bellairs started and the ayah screamed.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Enter&mdash;let me see you!"</p>

  <p>A black beard and a turban and the figure of a man&mdash;and then white
  teeth and a saber-hilt and eyes that gleamed moved forward from the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"It is I, Mahommed Khan!" boomed the voice again, and the Risaldar stepped
  out into the lamplight and closed the door behind him. Then, with a courtly,
  long-discarded sweep of his right arm, he saluted.</p>

  <p>"At the heavenborn's service!"</p>

  <p>"Mahommed Khan! Thank God!"</p>

  <p>The old man's shabbiness was very obvious as he faced her, with his back
  against the iron-studded door; but he stood erect as a man of thirty, and his
  medals and his sword-hilt and his silver scabbard-tip were bright.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Mahommed Khan, you have seen my husband?"</p>

  <p>He bowed.</p>

  <p>"You have spoken to him?"</p>

  <p>The old man bowed again.</p>

  <p>"He left you in my keeping, heavenborn. I am to bring you safe to
  Jundhra!"</p>

  <p>She held her hand out and he took it like a cavalier, bending until he
  could touch her fingers with his lips.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this hurrying of the guns to Jundhra,
  Risaldar?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows, memsahib! The orders of the Sirkar come, and we of the service
  must obey. I am thy servant and the Sirkar's!"</p>

  <p>"You, old friend&mdash;that were servant, as you choose to call it, to
  my husband's father! I am a proud woman to have such friends at call!" She
  pointed to the ayah, recovering sulkily and rearranging the shawl about her
  shoulders. "That I call service, Risaldar. She cowers when a knock comes at
  the door! I need you, and you answer a hardly spoken prayer; what is
  friendship, if yours is not?"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar bowed low again.</p>

  <p>"I would speak with that ayah, heavenborn!" he muttered, almost into his
  beard. She could hardly catch the words.</p>

  <p>"I can't get her to speak to me at all tonight, Mahommed Khan. She's
  terrified almost out of her life at something. But perhaps you can do better.
  Try. Do you want to question her alone?"</p>

  <p>"By the heavenborn's favor, yes."</p>

  <p>Ruth walked down the room toward the window, drew the curtain back and
  leaned her head out where whatever breeze there was might fan her cheek. The
  Risaldar strode over to where the ayah cowered by an inner doorway.</p>

  <p>"She-Hindu-dog!" he growled at her. "Mother of whelps! Louse-ridden
  scavenger of sweepings! What part hast thou in all this treachery?
  Speak!"</p>

  <p>The ayah shrank away from him and tried to scream, but he gripped her by
  the throat and shook her.</p>

  <p>"Speak!" he growled again.</p>

  <p>But his ten iron fingers held her in a vise-like grip and she could not
  have answered him if she had tried to.</p>

  <p>"O Risaldar!" called Ruth suddenly, with her head still out of the window.
  He released the ayah and let her tumble as she pleased into a heap.</p>

  <p>"Heavenborn?"</p>

  <p>"What is that red glow on the skyline over yonder?"</p>

  <p>"A burning, heavenborn!"</p>

  <p>"A burning? What burning? Funeral pyres? It's very big for funeral
  pyres!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, heavenborn!"</p>

  <p>"What, then?"</p>

  <p>She was still unfrightened, unsuspicious of the untoward. The Risaldar's
  arrival on the scene had quite restored her confidence and she felt content
  to ride with him to Jundhra on the morrow.</p>

  <p>"Barracks, heavenborn!"</p>

  <p>"Barracks? What barracks?"</p>

  <p>"There is but one barracks between here and Jundhra."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;what has happened, Mahommed
  Khan?"</p>

  <p>"The worst has happened, heavenborn!"</p>

  <p>He stood between her and the ayah, so that she could not see the woman
  huddled on the floor.</p>

  <p>"The worst? You mean then&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;husband&mdash;
  you don't mean that my husband&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean, heavenborn that there is insurrection! All India is ablaze from
  end to end. These dogs here in Hanadra wait to rise because they think the
  section will return here in an hour or two; then they propose to burn it,
  men, guns and horses, like snakes in the summer grass. It is well that the
  section will not return! We will ride out safely before morning!"</p>

  <p>"And, my husband&mdash;he knew&mdash;all this&mdash;before he left
  me here?"</p>

  <p>"Nay! That he did not! Had I told him, he had disobeyed his orders and
  shamed his service; he is young yet, and a hothead! He will be far along the
  road to Jundhra before he knows what burns. And then he will remember that he
  trusts me and obey orders and press on!"</p>

  <p>"And you knew and did not tell him!"</p>

  <p>"Of a truth I knew!"</p>

  <p>She stood in silence for a moment, gazing at the red glow on the skyline,
  and then turned to read, if she could, what was on the grim, grizzled face of
  Mahommed Khan.</p>

  <p>"The ayah!" he growled. "I have yet to ask questions of the ayah. Have I
  permission to take her to the other room?"</p>

  <p>She was leaning through the window again and did not answer him.</p>

  <p>"Who's that moving in the shadow down below?" she asked him suddenly.</p>

  <p>He leaned out beside her and gazed into the shadow. Then he called softly
  in a tongue she did not know and some one rose up from the shadow and
  answered him.</p>

  <p>"Are we spied on, Risaldar?"</p>

  <p>"Nay. Guarded, heavenborn! That man is my half-brother. May I take the
  ayah through that doorway?"</p>

  <p>"Why not question her in here?"</p>

  <p>The mystery and sense of danger were getting the better of her; she was
  thoroughly afraid now&mdash;afraid to be left alone in the room for a
  minute even.</p>

  <p>"There are things she would not answer in thy presence!"</p>

  <p>"Very well. Only, please be quick!"</p>

  <p>He bowed. Swinging the door open, he pushed the ayah through it to the
  room beyond. Ruth was left alone, to watch the red glow on the skyline and
  try to see the outline of the watcher in the gloom below. No sound came
  through the heavy teak door that the Risaldar had slammed behind him, and no
  sound came from him who watched; but from the silence of the night outside
  and from dark corners of the room that she was in and from the roof and walls
  and floor here came little eerie noises that made her flesh creep, as though
  she were being stared at by eyes she could not see. She felt that she must
  scream, or die, unless she moved; and she was too afraid to move, and by far
  too proud to scream! At last she tore herself away from the window and ran to
  a low divan and lay on it, smothering her face among the cushions. It seemed
  an hour before the Risaldar came out again, and then he took her by
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Heavenborn!" he said. She looked up with a start, to find him standing
  close beside her.</p>

  <p>"Mahommed Khan! You're panting! What ails you?"</p>

  <p>"The heat, heavenborn&mdash;and I am old."</p>

  <p>His left hand was on his saber-hilt, thrusting it toward her respectfully;
  she noticed that it trembled.</p>

  <p>"Have I the heavenborn's leave to lock the ayah in that inner room?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Risaldar?"</p>

  <p>"The fiend had this in her possession!" He showed her a thin-bladed dagger
  with an ivory handle; his own hand shook as he held it out to her, and she
  saw that there were beads of perspiration on his wrist. "She would have
  killed thee!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense! Why, she wouldn't dare!"</p>

  <p>"She confessed before she&mdash;she confessed! Have I the heavenborn's
  leave?"</p>

  <p>"If you wish it."</p>

  <p>"And to keep the key?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so, if you think it wise."</p>

  <p>He strode to the inner door and locked it and hid the key in an inside
  pocket of his tunic.</p>

  <p>"And now, heavenborn," he said, "I crave your leave to bring my half-
  brother to the presence!"</p>

  <p>He scarcely waited for an answer, but walked to the window, leaned out of
  it and whistled. A minute later he was answered by the sound of fingernails
  scrabbling on the outer door. He turned the key and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Enter!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>Barefooted and ragged, but as clean as a soldier on parade and with huge
  knots of muscles bulging underneath his copper skin, a Rajput entered, bowing
  his six feet of splendid manhood almost to the floor.</p>

  <p>"This, heavenborn, is my half-brother, son of a low-born border-woman,
  whom my father chose to honor thus far! The dog is loyal!"</p>

  <p>"Salaam!" said Ruth, with little interest.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, memsahib!" muttered the shabby Rajput. "Does any watch?" demanded
  the Risaldar in Hindustani. "Aye, one."</p>

  <p>"And he?"</p>

  <p>"Is he of whom I spoke."</p>

  <p>"Where watches he?"</p>

  <p>"There is a hidden passage leading from the archway; he peeps out through
  a crack, having rolled back so far the stone that seals it." He held his
  horny fingers about an inch apart to show the distance.</p>

  <p>"Couldst thou approach unseen?"</p>

  <p>The Rajput nodded.</p>

  <p>"And there are no others there?"</p>

  <p>"No others."</p>

  <p>"Has thy strength left thee, or thy cunning?"</p>

  <p>"Nay!"</p>

  <p>"Then bring him!"</p>

  <p>Without a word in answer the giant turned and went, and the Risaldar made
  fast the door behind him. Ruth sat with her face between her hands, trying
  not to cry or shudder, but obsessed and overpowered by a sense of terror. The
  mystery that surrounded her was bad enough; but this mysterious ordering and
  coming to and fro among her friends was worse than horrible. She knew,
  though, that it would be useless to question Mahommed Khan before he chose to
  speak. They waited there in the dimly lighted room for what seemed like an
  age again; she, pale and tortured by weird imaginings; he, grim and
  bolt-upright like a statue of a warrior. Then sounds came from the stairs
  again and the Risaldar hurried to the door and opened it.</p>

  <p>In burst the Risaldar's half-brother, breathing heavily and bearing a load
  nearly as big as he was.</p>

  <p>"The pig caught my wrist within the opening!" he growled, tossing his
  gagged and pinioned burden on the floor. "See where he all but broke it!"</p>

  <p>"What is thy wrist to the service of the Raj? Is he the right one?"</p>

  <p>"Aye!" He stooped and tore a twisted loin-cloth from his victim's face,
  and the Risaldar walked to the lamp and brought it, to hold it above the
  prostrate form. Ruth left the divan and stood between the men, terrified by
  she knew not what fear, but drawn into the lamplight by insuperable
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"This, heavenborn," said the Risaldar, prodding at the man with his
  scabbard-point, "is none other than the High Priest of Kharvani's temple
  here, the arch-ringleader in all the treachery afoot&mdash;now hostage for
  thy safety!"</p>

  <p>He turned to his half-brother. "Unbind the thing he lies with!" he
  commanded, and the giant unwrapped a twisted piece of linen from the High
  Priest's mouth.</p>

  <p>"So the big fox peeped through the trapdoor, because he feared to trust
  the other foxes; and the big fox fell into the trap!" grinned the Risaldar.
  "Bring me that table over yonder, thou!"</p>

  <p>The half-brother did as he was told.</p>

  <p>"Lay it here, legs upward, on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Now, bind him to it&mdash;an arm to a leg and a leg to a leg.</p>

  <p>"Remove his shoes.</p>

  <p>"Put charcoal in yon brazier. Light it. Bring it hither!"</p>

  <p>He seized a brass tongs, chose a glowing coal and held it six inches from
  the High Priest's naked foot.</p>

  <p>Ruth screamed.</p>

  <p>"Courage, heavenborn! Have courage! This is naught to what he would have
  done to thee! .... Now, speak, thou priest of infidels! What plans are laid
  and who will rise and when?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapB3"
     id="chapB3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Sergeant!"</p>

  <p>"Sir!"</p>

  <p>The close-cropped, pipe-clayed non-commissioned officer spurred his horse
  into a canter until his scabbard clattered at young Bellairs' boot. Nothing
  but the rattling and the jolting of the guns and ammunition-wagon was
  audible, except just on ahead of them the click-clack, click-click-clack of
  the advance-guard. To the right and left of them the shadowy forms of giant
  banyan-trees loomed and slid past them as they had done for the past four
  hours, and for ten paces ahead they could see the faintly outlined shape of
  the trunk road that they followed. The rest was silence and a pall of
  blackness obscuring everything. They had ridden along a valley, but they had
  emerged on rising ground and there was one spot of color in the pall now, or
  else a hole in it.</p>

  <p>"What d'you suppose that is burning over there?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't say, sir."</p>

  <p>"How far away is it?"</p>

  <p>"Very hard to tell on a night like this, sir. It might be ten miles away
  and might be twenty. By my reckoning it's on our road, though, and somewhere
  between here and Jundhra."</p>

  <p>"So it seems to me; our road swings round to the right presently, doesn't
  it? That'll lead us right to it. That would make it Doonha more or less.
  D'you suppose it's at Doonha?"</p>

  <p>"I was thinking it might be, sir. If it's Doonha, it means that the sepoy
  barracks and all the stores are burning&mdash;there's nothing else there
  that would make all that flame!"</p>

  <p>"There are two companies of the Thirty-third there, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, but they're under canvas; tents would blaze up, but they'd die
  down again in a minute. That fire's steady and growing bigger!"</p>

  <p>"It's the sepoy barracks, then!"</p>

  <p>"Seems so to me, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Halt!" roared Bellairs. The advance-guard kicked up a little shower of
  sparks, trace-chains slacked with a jingle and the jolting ceased. Bellairs
  rode up to the advance-guard.</p>

  <p>"Now, Sergeant," he ordered, "it looks as though that were the Doonha
  barracks burning over yonder. There's no knowing, though, what it is. Send
  four men on, two hundred yards ahead of you, and you and the rest keep a good
  two hundred yards ahead of the guns. See that the men keep on the alert, and
  mind that they spare their horses as much as possible. If there's going to be
  trouble, we may just as well be ready for it!"</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, then!"</p>

  <p>At a word from the sergeant, four men clattered off and were swallowed in
  the darkness. A minute later the advance-guard followed them and then, after
  another minute's pause, young Bellairs' voice was raised into a ringing shout
  again.</p>

  <p>"Section, advance! Trot, march!"</p>

  <p>The trace-chains tightened, and the clattering, bumping, jingling
  procession began again, its rear brought up by the six-horse
  ammunition-wagon. They rode speechless for the best part of an hour, each
  man's eyes on the distant conflagration that had begun now to light up the
  whole of the sky ahead of them. They still rode in darkness, but they seemed
  to be approaching the red rim of the Pit. Huge, billowing clouds of smoke,
  red-lit on the under side, belched upward to the blackness overhead, and a
  something that was scarcely sound&mdash;for it was yet too distant&mdash;
  warned them that it was no illusion they were riding into. The conflagration
  grew. It seemed to be nearly white-hot down below.</p>

  <p>Bellairs wet his finger and held it extended upward.</p>

  <p>"There's no wind that I can feel!" he muttered. "And yet, if that were a
  grass-fire, there'd be game and rats and birds and things&mdash;some of 'em
  would bolt this way. That's the Doonha barracks burning or I'm a black man,
  which the Lord forbid!"</p>

  <p>A minute later, every man in the section pricked up his ears. There was no
  order given; but a sensation ran the whole length of it and a movement from
  easy riding to tense rigidity that could be felt by some sixth sense. Every
  man was listening, feeling, groping with his senses for something he could
  neither hear as yet nor see, but that he knew was there. And then,
  far-distant yet&mdash;not above, but under the jolting of the gun-wheels
  and the rattle of the scabbards&mdash;they could hear the
  clickety-clickety-clickety-click of a horse hard-ridden.</p>

  <p>They had scarcely caught that sound, they had barely tightened up their
  bridle-reins, when another sound, one just as unmistakable, burst out in
  front of them. A ragged, ill-timed volley ripped out from somewhere near the
  conflagration and was answered instantly by one that was close-ripped like
  the fire of heavy ordnance. And then one of the advance-guard wheeled his
  horse and drove his spurs home rowel-deep. He came thundering back along the
  road with his scabbard out in the wind behind him and reined up suddenly when
  his horse's forefeet were abreast of the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"There's some one coming, sir, hard as he can gallop! He's one of our men
  by the sound of him. His horse is shod&mdash;and I thought I saw steel when
  the fire-light fell on him a minute ago!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure there's only one?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, sir! You can hear him now!"</p>

  <p>"All right! Fall in behind me!"</p>

  <p>Bellairs felt his sword-hilt and cocked a pistol stealthily, but he gave
  no orders to the section. This might be a native soldier run amuck, and it
  might be a messenger; but in either case, friend or foe, if there was only
  one man he could deal with him alone.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" roared the advance-guard suddenly. But the horse's hoof-beats
  never checked for a single instant.</p>

  <p>"Halt, you! Who comes there?"</p>

  <p>"Friend!" came the answer, in an accent that was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>"What friend? Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>One of the advance-guard reined his horse across the road. The others
  followed suit and blocked the way effectually. "Halt!" they roared in
  unison.</p>

  <p>The main body of the advance came up with them.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" shouted the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"We'll soon see! Here he comes!"</p>

  <p>"Out of my way!" yelled a voice, as a foamed-flecked horse burst out of
  the darkness like an apparition and bore straight down on them&mdash;his
  head bored a little to one side, the red rims of his nostrils wide distended
  and his whole sense and energy, and strength concentrated on pleasing the
  speed-hungry Irishman who rode him. He flashed into them head-on, like a
  devil from the outer darkness. His head touched a man's knee&mdash;and he
  rose and tried to jump him! "His breast crashed full into the obstruction and
  horse and gunner crashed down to the road.</p>

  <p>A dozen arms reached out&mdash;twelve horses surged in a clattering
  melee&mdash;two hands gripped the reins and four arms seized the rider, and
  in a second the panting charger was brought up all-standing. The sergeant
  thrust his grim face closer and peered at their capture.</p>

  <p>"Good&mdash;, if it ain't an officer!" he exclaimed. "I beg your pardon,
  sir!"</p>

  <p>And at that instant the section rattled, up behind them, with Bellairs in
  the lead.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" roared Bellairs. "What's this?"</p>

  <p>"Bloody murder, arson, high treason, mutiny and death! Blood and onions,
  man! Don't your men know an officer when they see one? Who are you? Are you
  Bellairs? Then why in God's name didn't you say so sooner? What have you
  waited for?</p>

  <p>How many hours is it since you got the message through from Jundhra?
  Couldn't you see the barracks burning? Who am I&mdash;I'm Captain O'Rourke,
  of the Thirty-third, sent to see what you're doing on the road, that's who I
  am! A full-fledged; able-bodied captain wasted in a crisis, just because you
  didn't choose to hurry! Poison take your confounded gunners, sir! Have they
  nothing better to engage them than holding up officers on the Queen's trunk
  road?</p>

  <p>"Supposing you tell me what's the matter?" suggested young Bellairs,
  prompt as are most of his breed to appear casual the moment there was cause
  to feel excited.</p>

  <p>"Your gunners have taken all my breath, sir. I can't speak!"</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't take chances with a section of artillery! They're not like
  infantry&mdash;they don't sleep all the time&mdash;you can't ride through
  them as a rule!"</p>

  <p>"Don't sleep, don't they! Then what have you been doing on the road? And
  what are you standing here for? Ride, man, ride! You're wanted!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way, then!" suggested Bellairs, and Captain O'Rourke
  legged his panting charger over to the roadside.</p>

  <p>"Advance-guard, forward, trot!" commanded the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"Have you brought your wife with you?" demanded O'Rourke, peering into the
  jingling blackness.</p>

  <p>"No. Of course not. Why?"</p>

  <p>"'Of course not! Why?' says the man! Hell and hot porridge! Why, the whole
  of India's ablaze from end to end&mdash;the sepoys have mutinied to a man,
  and the rest have joined them! There's bloody murder doing&mdash;they've
  shot their officers&mdash;Hammond's dead and Carstairs and Welfleet and
  heaven knows who else. They've burned their barracks and the stores and
  they're trying to seize the magazine. If they get that, God help every one.
  They're short of ammunition as it is, but two companies of the Thirty-third
  can't hold out for long against that horde. You'll be in the nick of time!
  Hurry, man! For the love of anything you like to name, get a move on!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapB4"
     id="chapB4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Trot, march!</p>

  <p>"Canter!"</p>

  <p>Bellairs was thinking of his wife, alone in Hanadra, unprotected except by
  a sixty-year-old Risaldar and a half-brother who was a civilian and an
  unknown quantity. There were cold chills running down his spine and a
  sickening sensation in his stomach. He rode ahead of the guns, with O'Rourke
  keeping pace beside him. He felt that he hated O'Rourke, hated everything,
  hated the Service, and the country&mdash;and the guns, that could put him
  into such a fiendish predicament.</p>

  <p>O'Rourke broke silence first.</p>

  <p>"Who is with your wife?" he demanded suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows! I left her under the protection of Risaldar Mahommed Khan,
  but he was to ride off for an escort for her."</p>

  <p>"Not your father's old Risaldar?" asked O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"The same."</p>

  <p>"Then thank God! I'd sooner trust him than I would a regiment. He'll bring
  her in alive or slit the throats of half Asia&mdash;maybe he'll do both!
  Come, that's off our minds! She's safer with him than she would be here. Have
  you lots of ammunition?"</p>

  <p>"I brought all I had with me at Hanadra."</p>

  <p>"Good! What you'll need tonight is grape!"</p>

  <p>"I've lots of it. It's nearly all grape."</p>

  <p>"Hurrah! Then we'll treat those dirty mutineers to a dose or two of pills
  they won't fancy! Come on, man&mdash;set the pace a little faster!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't my orders say anything about a mutiny or bringing in my
  wife?"</p>

  <p>"Dunno! I didn't write 'em. I can guess, though. There'd be something like
  nine reasons. For one thing, they'd credit you with sense enough to bring her
  in without being told. For another, the messenger who took the note might
  have got captured on the way&mdash;they wouldn't want to tell the sepoys
  more than they could help. Then there'd be something like a hurry. They're
  attacked there too&mdash;can't even send us assistance. Told us to waylay
  you and make use of you. Maybe they forgot your wife&mdash;maybe they
  didn't. It's a devil of a business anyhow!"</p>

  <p>It was difficult to talk at the speed that they were making, with their
  own horses breathing heavily, O'Rourke's especially; the guns thundering
  along behind them and the advance-guard clattering in front, and their
  attention distracted every other minute by the noise of volleys on ahead and
  the occasional staccato rattle of independent firing. The whole sky was now
  alight with the reflection of the burning barracks and they could see the
  ragged outlines of the cracking walls silhouetted against the blazing red
  within. One mile or less from the burning buildings they could see, too, the
  occasional flash of rifles where the two companies of the Thirty-third,
  Honorable East India Company's Light Infantry, held out against the
  mutineers.</p>

  <p>"Why did they mutiny?" asked Bellairs.</p>

  <p>"God knows! Nobody knows! Nobody knows anything! I'm thinking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thinking what?"</p>

  <p>"Forrester-Carter is commanding. We'll settle this business pretty
  quickly, now you've come. Then&mdash;Steady, boy! Steady! Hold up! This
  poor horse of mine is just about foundered, by the feel of him. He'll reach
  Doonha, though. Then we'll ask Carter to make a dash on Hanadra and bring
  Mrs. Bellairs&mdash;maybe we'll meet her and the Risaldar half-way&mdash;
  who knows? The sepoys wouldn't expect that, either. The move'd puzzle 'em
&mdash;it'd be a good move, to my way of thinking."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope Carter will consent!" prayed Bellairs fervently. "Now, what's
  the lay of things?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't tell you! When I left, our men were surrounded. I had to burst
  through the enemy to get away. Ours are all around the magazine and the
  sepoys are on every side of them. You'll have to use diagonal fire unless you
  want to hurt some of our chaps&mdash;sweep 'em cornerwise. There's high
  ground over to the right there, within four hundred yards of the position.
  Maybe they're holding it, though&mdash;there's no knowing!"</p>

  <p>They could hear the roar of the flames now, and could see the figures of
  sepoys running here and there. The rattle of musketry was incessant. They
  could hear howls and yells and bugle-calls blown at random by the sepoys, and
  once, in answer as it seemed to a more than usually savage chorus from the
  enemy&mdash;a chorus that was punctuated by a raging din of intermittent
  rifle-fire&mdash;a ringing cheer.</p>

  <p>"They must be in a tight hole!" muttered Bellairs. "Answer that, men! All
  together, now! Let 'em know we're coming."</p>

  <p>The men rose in their stirrups all together, and sent roaring through the
  blackness the deep-throated "Hip-hip-hur-r-a-a-a-a-a!" that has gladdened
  more than one beleaguered British force in the course of history. It is quite
  different from the "Hur-o-a-o-a-u-r-rh" of a forlorn hope, or the
  high-pitched note of pleasure that signals the end of a review. It means
  "Hold on, till we get there, boys!" and it carries its meaning, clear and
  crisp and unmistakable, in its note.</p>

  <p>The two beleaguered companies heard it and answered promptly with another
  cheer.</p>

  <p>"By gad, they must be in a hole!" remarked Bellairs.</p>

  <p>British soldiers do not cheer like that, all together, unless there is
  very good reason to feel cheerless. They fight, each man according to his
  temperament, swearing or laughing, sobbing or singing comic songs, until the
  case looks grim. Then, though, the same thrill runs through the whole of
  them, the same fire blazes in their eyes, and the last ditch that they line
  has been known to be a grave for the enemy.</p>

  <p>"Trumpeter! Sound close-order!"</p>

  <p>The trumpet rang. The advance-guard drew rein for the section to catch up.
  The guns drew abreast of one another and the mounted gunners formed in a
  line, two deep, in front of them. The ammunition-wagon trailed like a tail
  behind.</p>

  <p>"That high ground over there, I think!" suggested O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir. Section, right! Trot, march! Canter!"</p>

  <p>Crash went the guns and the following wagon across the roadside ditch. The
  tired horses came up to the collar as service-horses always will, generous to
  the last ounce of strength they have in them.</p>

  <p>"Gallop!"</p>

  <p>The limbers bumped and jolted and the short-handled whips cracked like the
  sound of pistol-practise. Blind, unreconnoitered, grim&mdash;like a black
  thunderbolt loosed into the blackness&mdash;the two guns shot along a
  hollow, thundered up a ridge and burst into the fire-light up above the
  mutineers, in the last place where any one expected them. A howl came from
  the road that they had left, a hundred sepoys had rushed down to block their
  passage the moment that their cheer had rung above the noise of battle.</p>

  <p>"Action&mdash;front!" roared young Bellairs, and the muzzles swung round
  at the gallop, jerked into position by the wheeling teams.</p>

  <p>"With case, at four hundred!"</p>

  <p>The orders were given and obeyed almost before the guns had lost their
  motion. The charges had been rammed into the greedy muzzles before the horses
  were away, almost&mdash;and that takes but a second&mdash;the horses
  vanish like blown smoke when the game begins. A howl from the mutineers told
  that they were seen; a volley from the British infantry announced that they
  were yet in time; and "boom-boom!" went both guns together.</p>

  <p>The grapeshot whined and shrieked, and the ranks of the sepoys wilted,
  mown down as though a scythe had swept them. Once, and once only, they
  gathered for a charge on the two guns; but they were met half-way up the rise
  by a shrieking blast of grape that ripped through them and took the heart out
  of them; and the grape was followed by well-aimed volleys from behind. Then
  they drew off to sulk and make fresh plans at a distance, and Bellairs took
  his section unmolested into the Thirty-third-lined rampart round the
  magazine.</p>

  <p>"What kept you, sir?" demanded Colonel Forrester-Carter, nodding to him in
  answer to his salute and holding out his right arm while a sergeant bandaged
  it.</p>

  <p>"My wife, sir&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is she? Didn't you bring her?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Still at Hanadra, sir&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let the men fall in! Call the roll at once!"</p>

  <p>"There was nothing in my orders, sir, about&mdash;" But Colonel Carter cut
  him short with a motion and turned his back on him.</p>

  <p>"Much obliged, Sergeant," he said, slipping his wounded arm into an
  improvised sling. "How many wagons have we here?"</p>

  <p>"Four, sir."</p>

  <p>"And horses?"</p>

  <p>"All shot dead except your charger, sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Ask Captain Trevor to come here."</p>

  <p>The sergeant disappeared into the shadows, and a moment later Captain
  Trevor came running up and saluted.</p>

  <p>"There are seven wounded, sir, and nineteen dead," he reported.</p>

  <p>"Better than I had hoped, Trevor! Will you set a train to that magazine,
  please, and blow it up the moment we are at a safe distance?"</p>

  <p>Trevor seemed surprised, but he saluted and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"O'Rourke! Please see about burying the dead at once. Mr. Bellairs, let me
  have two horses, please, and their drivers, from each gun. Sergeant! See
  about putting the wounded into the lightest of the wagons and harness in four
  gun-horses the best way you can manage."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>"Which is your best horseman, Mr. Bellairs? Is his horse comparatively
  fresh? I'll need him to gallop with a message. I'll dictate it to Captain
  O'Rourke as soon as he is ready. Let the gunner stay here close to me."</p>

  <p>Bellairs sought out his best man and the freshest-seeming horse in
  wondering silence. He felt sick with anxiety, for what could one lone veteran
  Risaldar do to protect Mrs. Bellairs against such a horde as was in Hanadra?
  He looked at the barracks, which were still blazing heavenward and
  illuminating the whole country-side, and shuddered as he wondered whether his
  quarters at Hanadra were in flames yet.</p>

  <p>"It's a good job old Carter happened to be here!" he heard one of his men
  mumble to another. "He's a man, that is&mdash;I'd sooner fight under him
  than any I know of!"</p>

  <p>"What d'you suppose the next move is?" asked the other man.</p>

  <p>"I'd bet on it! I'll bet you what you like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Bellairs did not hear the rest.</p>

  <p>A bugle rang out into the night. The gunners stood by their horses. Even
  the sentries, posted outside the rampart to guard against alarm, stood to
  attention, and Colonel Carter, wincing from the pain in his right arm, walked
  out in front of where the men were lined up.</p>

  <p>Captain O'Rourke walked up and saluted him.</p>

  <p>"I've arranged to bury them in that trench we dug this evening, sir, when
  the trouble started. It's not very deep, but it holds them all. I've laid
  them in it."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure they're all dead?"</p>

  <p>"I've burnt their fingers with matches, sir. I don't know of any better
  way to make sure."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Can you remember any of the burial service?"</p>

  <p>"'Fraid not, sir."</p>

  <p>"Um! That's a pity. And I'm afraid I can't spare the time. Take a firing-
  party, Captain O'Rourke, and give them the last honors, at all events."</p>

  <p>A party marched away toward the trench, and several minutes later
  O'Rourke's voice was heard calling through the darkness, "All ready,
  sir!"</p>

  <p>"Present arms!" ordered the colonel, and the gunners sat their horses with
  their hilts raised to their hips and the two long lines of infantry stood
  rigid at the general salute, while five volleys&mdash;bulleted&mdash;
  barked upward above the grave. They were, answered by sniping from the
  mutineers, who imagined that reprisals had commenced.</p>

  <p>"Now, men!" said Colonel Carter, raising his voice until every officer and
  man along the line could hear him, "as you must have realized, things are
  very serious indeed. We are cut off from support, but now that the guns are
  here to help us, we could either hold out here until relieved or else fight
  our way into Jundhra, where I have no doubt we are very badly needed. But"
&mdash;he spoke more slowly and distinctly now, with a distinct pause
  between each word&mdash;"there is an officer's lady alone, and practically
  unprotected at Hanadra. Our duty is clear. You are tired&mdash;I know it.
  You have had no supper, and will get none. It means forced marching for the
  rest of this night and a good part of tomorrow and more fighting, possibly on
  an empty stomach; it means the dust and the heat and the discomfort of the
  trunk road for all of us and danger of the worst kind instead of safety
&mdash;for we shall have farther to go to reach Jundhra. But I would do the
  same, and you men all know it, for any soldier's wife in my command, or any
  English woman in India. We will march now on Hanadra. No! No demonstrations,
  please!"</p>

  <p>His uplifted left hand was just in time to check a roar of answering
  approval.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you so?" exclaimed a gunner to the man beside him in an
  undertone. "Him leave a white woman to face this sort o' music? He'd fight
  all India first!"</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later two companies of men marched out behind the guns,
  followed by a cart that bore their wounded. As they reached the trunk road
  they were saluted by a reverberating blast when the magazine that they had
  fought to hold blew skyward. They turned to cheer the explosion and then
  settled down to march in deadly earnest and, if need be, to fight a
  rear-guard action all the way.</p>

  <p>And in the opposite direction one solitary gunner rode, hell-bent-for-
  leather, with a note addressed to "O. C.&mdash;Jundhra." It was short and
  to the point. It ran:</p>

  <p class="letter">Have blown up magazine; Mrs. Bellairs at Hanadra; have gone
  to rescue her.<br>

  <h2><a name="chapB5"
     id="chapB5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The red glow of barracks burning&mdash;an ayah from whom a
  dagger has been taken locked in another room&mdash;the knowledge that there
  are fifty thousand Aryan brothers, itching to rebel, within a stone's throw
&mdash;and two lone protectors of an alien race intent on torturing a High
  Priest, each and every one of these is a disturbing feature. No woman, and
  least of all a young woman such as Ruth Bellairs, can be blamed for being
  nervous under the stress of such conditions or for displaying a certain
  amount of feminine unreasonableness.</p>

  <p>She stood shivering for a minute and watched spellbound while Mahommed
  Khan held the hot coal closer and even closer to the High Priest's naked
  foot. The priest writhed in anticipation of the agony and turned his eyes
  away, and as he turned them they met Ruth's. High priests of a religion that
  includes sooth-saying and prophecy and bribery of gods among its rites are
  students of human nature, and especially of female human nature. Knowledge of
  it and of how it may be gulled, and when, is the first essential of their
  calling. Her pale face, her blue eyes strained in terror, the parted lips and
  the attitude of tension, these gave him an idea. Before the charcoal touched
  him, he screamed&mdash;screamed like a wounded horse.</p>

  <p>"Mahommed Khan, stop! Stop this instant! I won't have it! I won't have my
  life, even, on those terms! D'you hear me, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Have courage, heavenborn! There is but one way to force a Hindu priest,
  unless it be by cutting off his revenues&mdash;he must be hurt! This dog is
  unhurt as yet&mdash;see! The fire has not yet touched his foot!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let it, Mahommed Khan! Set that iron down! This is my room. I will
  not have crime committed here!"</p>

  <p>"And how long does the heavenborn think it would be her room were this
  evil-living pig of a priest at large, or how long before a worse crime were
  committed? Heavenborn, the hour is late and the charcoal dies out rapidly
  when it has left the fire! See. I must choose another piece!"</p>

  <p>He rummaged in the brazier, and she screamed again.</p>

  <p>"I will not have it, Risaldar! You must find another way."</p>

  <p>"Memsahib! Thy husband left thee in my care. Surely it is my right to
  choose the way?"</p>

  <p>"Leave me, then! I relieve you of your trust. I will not have him tortured
  in my room, or anywhere!"</p>

  <p>Mahommed Khan bowed low.</p>

  <p>"Under favor, heavenborn," he answered, "my trust is to your husband. I
  can be released by him, or by death, not otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Once, and for all, Mahommed Khan, I will not have you torture him in
  here!"</p>

  <p>"Memsahib, I have yet to ride for succor! At daybreak, when these Hindus
  learn that the guns will not come back, they will rise to a man. Even now we
  must find a hiding-place or&mdash;it is not good even to think what I might
  find on my return!"</p>

  <p>He leaned over the priest again, but without the charcoal this time.</p>

  <p>"Speak, thou!" he ordered, growling in Hindustani through his savage black
  mustache. "I have yet to hear what price a Hindu sets on immunity from
  torture!"</p>

  <p>But the priest, it seemed, had formed a new idea. He had been looking
  through puckered eyes at Ruth, keen, cool calculation in his glance, and in
  spite of the discomfort of his strained position he contrived to nod.</p>

  <p>"Kharvani!" he muttered, half aloud.</p>

  <p>"Aye! Call on Kharvani!" sneered the Risaldar. "Perhaps the Bride of Sivi
  will appear! Call louder!"</p>

  <p>He stirred again among the charcoal with his tongs, and Ruth and the High
  Priest both shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Look!" said the High Priest in Hindustani, nodding in Ruth's direction.
  It was the first word that he had addressed to them. It took them by
  surprise, and the Risaldar and his half-brother turned and looked. Their
  breath left them.</p>

  <p>Framed in the yellow lamplight, her thin, hot-weather garments draped
  about her like a morning mist, Ruth stood and stared straight back at them
  through frightened eyes. Her blue-black hair, which had become loosened in
  her excitement, hung in a long plait over one shoulder and gleamed in the
  lamp's reflection. Her skin took on a faintly golden color from the feeble
  light, and her face seemed stamped with fear, anxiety, pity and suffering,
  all at once, that strangely enhanced her beauty, silhouetted as she was
  against the blackness of the wall behind, she seemed to be standing in an
  aura, shimmering with radiated light.</p>

  <p>"Kharvani!" said the High Priest to himself again, and the two Rajputs
  stood still like men dumfounded, and stared and stared and stared. They knew
  Kharvani's temple. Who was there in Hanadra, Christian or Mohammedan or
  Hindu, who did not? The show-building of the city, the ancient, gloomy,
  wonderful erection where bats lived in the dome and flitted round Kharvani's
  image, the place where every one must go who needed favors of the priests,
  the central hub of treason and intrigue, where every plot was hatched and
  every rumor had its origin&mdash;the ultimate, mazy, greedy, undisgorging
  goal of every bribe and every blackmail-wrung rupee!</p>

  <p>They knew, too, as every one must know who has ever been inside the place,
  the amazing, awe-inspiring picture of Kharvani painted on the inner wall; of
  Kharvani as she was idealized in the days when priests believed in her and
  artists thought the labor of a lifetime well employed in painting but one
  picture of her&mdash;Kharvani the sorrowful, grieving for the wickedness of
  earth; Kharvani, Bride of Siva, ready to intercede with Siva, the Destroyer,
  for the helpless, foolish, purblind sons of man.</p>

  <p>And here, before them, stood Kharvani&mdash;to the life!</p>

  <p>"What of Kharvani?" growled Mahommed Khan.</p>

  <p>"'A purblind fool, a sot and a Mohammedan,"' quoted the priest
  maliciously, "'how many be they, three or one?'"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar's hand went to his scabbard. His sword licked out free and
  trembled like a tuning-fork. He flicked with his thumbnail at the blade and
  muttered: "Sharp! Sharp as death itself!"</p>

  <p>The Hindu grinned, but the blade came down slowly until the point of it
  rested on the bridge of his nose. His eyes squinted inward, watching it.</p>

  <p>"Now, make thy gentle joke again!" growled the Risaldar. Ruth Bellairs
  checked a scream.</p>

  <p>"No blood!" she exclaimed. "Don't hurt him, Risaldar! I'll not have you
  kill a man in here&mdash;or anywhere, in cold blood, for that matter!
  Return your sword, sir!"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar swore into his beard. The High Priest grinned again. "I am
  not afraid to die!" he sneered. "Thrust with that toy of thine! Thrust home
  and make an end!"</p>

  <p>"Memsahib!" said the Risaldar, "all this is foolishness and waste of time!
  The hour is past midnight and I must be going. Leave the room&mdash;leave
  me and my half-brother with this priest for five short minutes and we will
  coax from him the secret of some hiding-place where you may lie hid until I
  come!"</p>

  <p>"But you'll hurt him!"</p>

  <p>"Not if he speaks, and speaks the truth!"</p>

  <p>"Promise me!"</p>

  <p>"On those conditions&mdash;yes!"</p>

  <p>"Where shall I go?"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar's eyes glanced toward the door of the inner room, but he
  hesitated. "Nay! There is the ayah!" he muttered. "Is there no other
  room?"</p>

  <p>"No, Risaldar, no other room except through that door. Besides, I would
  rather stay here! I am afraid of what you may do to that priest if I leave
  you alone with him!"</p>

  <p>"Now a murrain on all women, black and white!" swore Mahommed Khan beneath
  his breath. Then he turned on the priest again, and placed one foot on his
  stomach.</p>

  <p>"Speak!" he ordered. "What of Kharvani?"</p>

  <p>"Listen, Mahommed Khan!" Ruth Bellairs laid one hand on his sleeve, and
  tried to draw him back. "Your ways are not my ways! You are a soldier and a
  gentleman, but please remember that you are of a different race! I can not
  let my life be saved by the torture of a human being&mdash;no, not even of
  a Hindu priest! Maybe it's all right and honorable according to your ideas;
  but, if you did it, I would never be able to look my husband in the face
  again! No, Risaldar! Let this priest go, or leave him here&mdash;I don't
  care which, but don't harm him! I am quite ready to ride with you, now, if
  you like. I suppose you have horses? But I would rather die than think that a
  man was put to the torture to save me! Life isn't worth that price!"</p>

  <p>She spoke rapidly, urging him with every argument she knew; but the grim
  old Mohammedan shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Better die here," he answered her, "than on the road! No, memsahib. With
  thirteen blades behind me, I could reach Jundhra, or at least make a bold
  attempt; but single-handed, and with you to guard, the feat is impossible.
  This dog of a Hindu here knows of some hiding-place. Let him speak!"</p>

  <p>His hand went to his sword again, arid his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"Listen, heavenborn! I am no torturer of priests by trade! It is not my
  life that I would save!"</p>

  <p>"I know that, Mahommed Khan! I respect your motive. It's the method that I
  can't tolerate."</p>

  <p>The Risaldar drew his arm away from her and began to pace the room. The
  High Priest instantly began to speak to Ruth, whispering to her hurriedly in
  Hindustani, but she was too little acquainted with the language to understand
  him.</p>

  <p>"And I," said the Risaldar's half-brother suddenly, "am I of no further
  use?"</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten thee!" exclaimed the Risaldar.</p>

  <p>They spoke together quickly in their own language, drawing aside and
  muttering to each other. It was plain that the half-brother was making some
  suggestion and that the Risaldar was questioning him and cross-examining him
  about his plan, but neither Ruth nor the High Priest could understand a word
  that either of them said. At the end of two minutes or more, the Risaldar
  gave an order of some kind and the half-brother grunted and left the room
  without another word, closing the door noiselessly behind him. The Risaldar
  locked it again from the inside and drew the bolt.</p>

  <p>"We have made another plan, heavenborn!" he announced mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;you won't hurt this priest?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said the Risaldar. "He may be useful!"</p>

  <p>"Won't you unbind him, then? Look! His wrists and ankles are all
  swollen."</p>

  <p>"Let the dog swell!" he grunted.</p>

  <p>But Ruth stuck to her point and made him loosen the bonds a little.</p>

  <p>"A man lives and learns!" swore the Risaldar. "Such as he were cast into
  dungeons in my day, to feed on their own bellies until they had had enough of
  life!"</p>

  <p>"The times have changed!" said Ruth.</p>

  <p>The Risaldar looked out through the window toward the red glow on the sky-
  line.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Changed, have they!" he muttered. "I saw one such burning, once
  before!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chapB6"
     id="chapB6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The most wonderful thing in history, pointing with the
  surest finger to the trail of destiny, has been the fact that in every
  tremendous crisis there have been leaders on the spot to meet it. It is not
  so wonderful that there should be such men, for the world keeps growing
  better, and it is more than likely that the men who have left their
  footprints in the sands of time would compare to their own disadvantage with
  their compeers of today. The wonderful thing is that the right men have been
  in the right place at the right time. Scipio met Hannibal; Philip of Spain
  was forced to meet Howard of Effingham and Drake; Napoleon Bonaparte, the
  "Man of Destiny," found Wellington and Nelson of the Nile to deal with him;
  and, in America, men like George Washington and Grant and Lincoln seem, in
  the light of history, like timed, calculated, controlling devices in an
  intricate machine. It was so when the Indian Mutiny broke out. The struggle
  was unexpected. A handful of Europeans, commissioned and enlisted in the
  ordinary way, with a view to trade, not statesmanship, found themselves face
  to face at a minute's notice with armed and vengeful millions. Succor was a
  question of months, not days or weeks. India was ablaze from end to end with
  rebel fires that had been planned in secret through silent watchful years.
  The British force was scattered here and there in unconnected details, and
  each detail was suddenly cut off from every other one by men who had been
  trained to fight by the British themselves and who were not afraid to
  die.</p>

  <p>The suddenness with which the outbreak came was one of the chief assets of
  the rebels, for they were able to seize guns and military stores and
  ammunition at the very start of things, before the British force could
  concentrate. Their hour could scarcely have been better chosen. The Crimean
  War was barely over. Practically the whole of England's standing army was
  abroad and decimated by battle and disease. At home, politics had England by
  the throat; the income-tax was on a Napoleonic scale and men were more bent
  on worsting one another than on equipping armies. They had had enough of
  war.</p>

  <p>India was isolated, at the rebels' mercy, so it seemed. There were no
  railway trains to make swift movements of troops possible. Distances were
  reckoned by the hundred miles&mdash;of sun-baked, thirsty dust in the hot
  weather, and of mud in the rainy season. There were no telegraph-wires, and
  the British had to cope with the mysterious, and even yet unsolved, native
  means of sending news&mdash;the so-called "underground route," by which
  news and instructions travel faster than a pigeon flies. There was never a
  greater certainty or a more one-sided struggle, at the start. The only
  question seemed to be how many days, or possibly weeks, would pass before
  jackals crunched the bones of every Englishman in India.</p>

  <p>But at the British helm was Nicholson, and under him were a hundred other
  men whose courage and resource had been an unknown quantity until the
  outbreak came. Nicholson's was the guiding spirit, but it needed only his
  generalship to fire all the others with that grim enthusiasm that has pulled
  Great Britain out of so many other scrapes. Instead of wasting time in
  marching and countermarching to relieve the scattered posts, a swift, sudden
  swoop was made on Delhi, where the eggs of the rebellion had hatched.</p>

  <p>As many of the outposts as could be reached were told to fight their own
  way in, and those that could not be reached were left to defend themselves
  until the big blow had been struck at the heart of things. If Delhi could be
  taken, the rebels would be paralyzed and the rescue of beleaguered details
  would be easier; so, although odds of one hundred or more to one are usually
  considered overlarge in wartime&mdash;when the hundred hold the fort and
  the one must storm the gate&mdash;there was no time lost in hesitation.
  Delhi was the goal; and from north and south and east and west the men who
  could march marched, and those who could not entrenched themselves, and made
  ready to die in the last ditch.</p>

  <p>Some of the natives were loyal still. There were men like Risaldar
  Mahommed Khan, who would have died ten deaths ten times over rather than be
  false in one particular to the British Government. It was these men who
  helped to make intercommunication possible, for they could carry messages and
  sometimes get through unsuspected where a British soldier would have been
  shot before he had ridden half a mile. Their loyalty was put to the utmost
  test in that hour, for they can not have believed that the British force
  could win. They knew the extent of what was out against them and knew, too,
  what their fate would be in the event of capture or defeat. There would be
  direr, slower vengeance wreaked on them than on the alien British. But they
  had eaten British salt and pledged their word, and nothing short of death
  could free them from it. There was not a shred of self interest to actuate
  them; there could not have been. Their given word was law and there it
  ended.</p>

  <p>There were isolated commands, like that at Jundhra, that were too far away
  to strike at Delhi and too large and too efficient to be shut in by the
  mutineers. They were centers on their own account of isolated small
  detachments, and each commander was given leave to act as he saw best,
  provided that he acted and did it quickly. He could either march to the
  relief of his detachments or call them in, but under no condition was he to
  sit still and do nothing.</p>

  <p>So, Colonel Carter's note addressed to O. C.&mdash;Jundhra only got two-
  thirds of the way from Doonha. The gunner who rode with it was brought to a
  sudden standstill by an advance-guard of British cavalry, and two minutes
  later he found himself saluting and giving up his note to the General
  Commanding. The rebels at Jundhra had been worsted and scattered after an
  eight-hour fight, and General Turner had made up his mind instantly to sweep
  down on Hanadra with all his force and relieve the British garrison at Doonha
  on his way.</p>

  <p>Jundhra was a small town and unhealthy. Hanadra was a large city, the
  center of a province; and, from all accounts, Hanadra had not risen yet. By
  seizing Hanadra before the mutineers had time to barricade themselves inside
  it, he could paralyze the countryside, for in Hanadra were the money and
  provisions and, above all, the Hindu priests who, in that part of India at
  least, were the brains of the rebellion. So he burned Jundhra, to make it
  useless to the rebels, and started for Hanadra with every man and horse and
  gun and wagon and round of ammunition that he had.</p>

  <p>Now news in India travels like the wind, first one way and then another.
  But, unlike the wind, it never whistles. Things happen and men know it and
  the information spreads&mdash;invisible, intangible, inaudible, but
  positive and, in nine cases out of ten, correct in detail. A government can
  no more censor it, or divert it, or stop it on the way, than it can stay the
  birthrate or tamper with the Great Monsoon.</p>

  <p>First the priests knew it, then it filtered through the main bazaars and
  from them on through the smaller streets. By the time that General Turner had
  been two hours on the road with his command every man and woman and child in
  Hanadra knew that the rebels had been beaten back and that Hanadra was his
  objective. They knew, too, that the section had reached Doonha, had relieved
  it and started back again. And yet not a single rebel who had fought in
  either engagement was within twenty miles of Hanadra yet!</p>

  <p>In the old, low-ceilinged room above the archway Mahommed Khan paced up
  and down and chewed at his black mustache, kicking his scabbard away from him
  each time he turned and glowering at the priest.</p>

  <p>"That dog can solve this riddle!" he kept muttering. Then he would glare
  at Ruth impatiently and execrate the squeamishness of women. Ruth sat on the
  divan with her face between her hands, trying to force herself to realize the
  full extent of her predicament and beat back the feeling of hysteria that
  almost had her in its grip. The priest lay quiet. He was in a torture of
  discomfort on the upturned table, but he preferred not to give the Risaldar
  the satisfaction of knowing it. He eased his position quietly from time to
  time as much as his bandages would let him, but he made no complaint.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Ruth looked up. It had occurred to her that she was wasting time
  and that if she were to fight off the depression that had seized her she
  would be better occupied.</p>

  <p>"Mahommed Khan," she said, "if I am to leave here on horseback, with you
  or with an escort, I had better collect some things that I would like to take
  with me. Let me in that room, please!"</p>

  <p>"The horse will have all that it can carry, heavenborn, without a load of
  woman's trappings."</p>

  <p>"My jewels? I can take them, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>He bowed. "They are in there? I will bring them, heavenborn!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! You don't know where to find them."</p>

  <p>"The ayah&mdash;will&mdash;will show me!"</p>

  <p>He fitted the key into the lock and turned it, but Ruth was at his side
  before he could pass in through the door.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Risaldar! The ayah can't hurt me. You have taken her knife
  away, and that is my room. I will go in there alone!"</p>

  <p>She pushed past him before he could prevent her, thrust the door back and
  peered in.</p>

  <p>"Stay, heavenborn&mdash;I will explain!"</p>

  <p>"Explain what?"</p>

  <p>The dim light from the lamp was filtering in past them, and her eyes were
  slowly growing accustomed to the gloom. There was something lying on the
  floor, in the middle of the room, that was bulky and shapeless and
  unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>"Ayah!" said Ruth. "Ayah!"</p>

  <p>But there was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Where is she, Risaldar?"</p>

  <p>"She is there, heavenborn!"</p>

  <p>"Is she asleep?"</p>

  <p>"Aye! She sleeps deeply!"</p>

  <p>There was, something in the Rajput's voice that was strange, that hinted
  at a darker meaning.</p>

  <p>"Ayah!" she called again, afraid, though she knew not why, to enter.</p>

  <p>"She guards the jewels, heavenborn! Wait, while I bring the lamp!"</p>

  <p>He crossed the room, brought it and stepped with it past Ruth, straight
  into the room.</p>

  <p>"See!" he said, holding the lamp up above his head. "There in her bosom
  are the jewels! It was there, too, that she had the knife to slay thee with!
  My sword is clean, yet, heavenborn! I slew her with my fingers, thus!"</p>

  <p>He kicked the prostrate ayah, and, as the black face with the wide-open
  bloodshot eyes and the protruding tongue rolled sidewise and the body moved,
  a little heap of jewels fell upon the floor. Mahommed Khan stooped down to
  gather them, bending, a little painfully, on one old knee&mdash;but stopped
  half-way and turned. There was a thud behind him in the doorway. Ruth
  Bellairs had fainted, and lay as the ayah had lain when Risaldar had not yet
  locked her in the room.</p>

  <p>He raised the lamp and studied her in silence for a minute, looking from
  her to the bound priest and back to her again.</p>

  <p>"Now praised be Allah!" he remarked aloud, with a world of genuine relief
  in his voice. "Should she stay fainted for a little while, that
  priest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stalked into the middle of the outer room. He set the lamp down on a
  table and looked the priest over as a butcher might survey a sheep he is
  about to kill.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;robber of orphans&mdash;bleeder of widows' blood&mdash;
  dog of an idol-briber! This stands between thee and Kharvani!" He drew his
  sword and flicked the edges of it. "And this!" He took up the tongs again.
  "There is none now to plead or to forbid! Think! Show me the way out of this
  devil's nest, or&mdash;" He raised the tongs again.</p>

  <p>At that minute came a quiet knock. He set the tongs down again and crossed
  the room and opened the door.</p>

  <h2><a name="chapB7"
     id="chapB7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mahommed Khan closed the door again behind his half-brother
  and turned the key, but the half-brother shot the bolt home as well before he
  spoke, then listened intently for a minute with his ear to the keyhole.</p>

  <p>"Where is the priest's son?" growled the Risaldar, in the Rajput
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"I have him. I have the priestling in a sack. I have him trussed and bound
  and gagged, so that he can neither speak nor wriggle!"</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Hidden safely."</p>

  <p>"I said to bring him here!"</p>

  <p>"I could not. Listen! That ayah&mdash;where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Dead! What has the ayah to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"This&mdash;she was to give a sign. She was not to slay. She had leave
  only to take the jewels. Her orders were either to wait until she knew by
  questioning that the section would not return or else, when it had returned,
  to wait until the memsahib and Bellairs sahib slept, and then to make a sign.
  They grow tired of waiting now, for there is news! At Jundhra the rebels are
  defeated, and at Doonha likewise."</p>

  <p>"How know you this?"</p>

  <p>"By listening to the priests' talk while I lay in wait to snare the
  priestling. Nothing is known as yet as to what the guns or garrison at Doonha
  do, but it is known that they of Jundhra will march on Hanadra here. They
  search now for their High Priest, being minded to march out of here and set
  an ambush on the road."</p>

  <p>"They have time. From Jundhra to here is a long march! Until tomorrow
  evening or the day following they have time!"</p>

  <p>"Aye! And they have fear also! They seek their priest&mdash;listen."</p>

  <p>There were voices plainly audible in the courtyard down below, and two
  more men stood at the foot of the winding stairway whispering. By listening
  intently they could hear almost what they said, for the stone stairway acted
  like a whispering-gallery, the voices echoing up it from wall to wall.</p>

  <p>"Why do they seek him here?"</p>

  <p>"They have sought elsewhere and not found him; and there is talk&mdash;
  He claimed the memsahib as his share of the plunder. They think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mahommed Khan glared at the trussed-up priest and swore a savage oath
  beneath his breath.</p>

  <p>"Have they touched the stables yet?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No, not yet. The loot is to be divided evenly among certain of the
  priests, and no man may yet lay a hand on it."</p>

  <p>"Is there a guard there?"</p>

  <p>"No. No one would steal what the priests claim, and the priests will not
  trust one another. So the horses stand in their stalls unwatched."</p>

  <p>The voices down the stairs grew louder, and the sound of footsteps began
  ascending, slowly and with hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" said the Risaldar. "Light me that brazier again!"</p>

  <p>Charcoal lights quickly, and before the steps had reached the landing
  Mahommed Khan had a hot coal glowing in his tongs:</p>

  <p>"Now speak to them!" he growled at the shuddering priest. "Order them to
  go back to their temple and tell them that you follow!"</p>

  <p>The priest shut his lips tight and shook his head. With rescue so near as
  that, he could see no reason to obey. But the hot coal touched him, and a
  Hindu who may be not at all afraid to die can not stand torture.</p>

  <p>"I speak!" he answered, writhing.</p>

  <p>"Speak, then!" said the Risaldar, choosing a larger coal. Then, in the
  priest's language, which none&mdash;and least of all a Risaldar&mdash;can
  understand except the priests themselves, he began to shout directions,
  pitching his voice into a high, wailing, minor key. He was answered by
  another sing-song voice outside the door and he listened with a glowing coal
  held six inches from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"An eye for a false move!" hissed Mahommed Khan. "Two eyes are the forfeit
  unless they go down the stairs again! Then my half-brother here will follow
  to the temple and if any watch, or stay behind, thy ears will sizzle!"</p>

  <p>The High Priest raised his voice into a wail again, and the feet shuffled
  along the landing and descended.</p>

  <p>"Put down that coal!" he pleaded. "I have done thy bidding!"</p>

  <p>"Watch through the window!" said the Risaldar. "Then follow!"</p>

  <p>His giant half-brother peered from behind the curtain and listened. He
  could hear laughter, ribald, mocking laughter, but low, and plainly not
  intended for the High Priest's ears.</p>

  <p>"They go!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Then follow."</p>

  <p>Once again the Risaldar was left alone with the priest and the unconscious
  Ruth. She was suffering from the effects of long days and nights of
  nerve-destroying heat, with the shock of unexpected horror super-added, and
  she showed no disposition to recover consciousness. The priest, though, was
  very far from having lost his power to think.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool!" he sneered at the Risaldar, but the sword leaped from
  its scabbard at the word and he changed that line of argument. "You hold
  cards and know not how to play them!"</p>

  <p>"I know along which road my honor lies! I lay no plans to murder people in
  their sleep."</p>

  <p>"Honor! And what is honor? What is the interest on honor&mdash;how much
  percent?"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar turned his back on him, but the High Priest laughed.</p>

  <p>"'The days of the Raj are numbered!" said the priest. "The English will be
  slain to the last man and then where will you be? Where will be the profit on
  your honor?"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar listened, for he could not help it, but he made no
  answer.</p>

  <p>"Me you hold here, a prisoner. You can slay or torture. But what good will
  that do? The woman that you guard will fall sooner or later into Hindu hands.
  You can not fight against a legion. Listen! I hold the strings of wealth.
  With a jerk I can unloose a fortune in your lap. I need that woman
  there!"</p>

  <p>"For what?" snarled the Risaldar, whirling round on him, his eyes
  ablaze.</p>

  <p>"For power! Kharvani's temple here has images and paintings and a voice
  that speaks&mdash;but no Kharvani!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput turned away again and affected unconcern.</p>

  <p>"Could Kharvani but appear, could her worshipers but see Kharvani
  manifest, what would a lakh, two lakhs, a crore of rupees mean to me, the
  High Priest of her temple? I could give thee anything! The power over all
  India would be in my hands! Kharvani would but appear and say thus and thus,
  and thus would it be done!"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar's hand had risen to his mustache. His back was still turned
  on the priest, but he showed interest. His eyes wandered to where Ruth lay in
  a heap by the inner door and then away again.</p>

  <p>"Who would believe it?" he growled in an undertone.</p>

  <p>"They would all believe it! One and all! Even Mohammedans would become
  Hindus to worship at her shrine and beg her favors. Thou and I alone would
  share the secret. Listen! Loose me these bonds&mdash;my limbs ache."</p>

  <p>Mahommed Khan turned. He stooped and cut them with his sword.</p>

  <p>"Now I can talk," said the priest, sitting up and rubbing his ankles.
  "Listen. Take thou two horses and gallop off, so that the rest may think that
  the white woman has escaped. Then return here secretly and name thy price
&mdash;and hold thy tongue!"</p>

  <p>"And leave her in thy hands?" asked the Risaldar.</p>

  <p>"In my keeping."</p>

  <p>"Bah! Who would trust a Hindu priest!"</p>

  <p>The Rajput was plainly wavering and the priest stood up, to argue with him
  the better.</p>

  <p>"What need to trust me? You, sahib, will know the secret, and none other
  but myself will know it. Would I, think you, be fool enough to tell the rest,
  or, by withholding just payment from you, incite you to spread it broadcast?
  You and I will know it and we alone. To me the power that it will bring
&mdash;to you all the wealth you ever dreamed of, and more besides!"</p>

  <p>"No other priest would know?"</p>

  <p>"Not one! They will think the woman escaped!"</p>

  <p>"And she&mdash;where would you keep her?"</p>

  <p>"In a secret place I know of, below the temple."</p>

  <p>"Does any other know it?"</p>

  <p>"No. Not one!"</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said the Risaldar, stroking at his beard. "This woman never did
  me any wrong&mdash;but she is a woman, not a man. I owe her no fealty, and
  yet&mdash;I would not like to see her injured. Were I to agree to thy plan,
  there would needs be a third man in the secret."</p>

  <p>"Who? Name him," said the priest, grinning his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"My half-brother Suliman."</p>

  <p>"Agreed!"</p>

  <p>"He must go with us to the hiding-place and stay there as her
  servant."</p>

  <p>"Is he a silent man?"</p>

  <p>"Silent as the dead, unless I bid him speak!"</p>

  <p>"Then, that is agreed; he and thou and I know of this secret, and none
  other is to know it! Why wait? Let us remove her to the hiding-place!"</p>

  <p>"Wait yet for Suliman. How long will I be gone, think you, on my pretended
  flight?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, what think you, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I think many hours. There may be those that watch, or some that ride
  after me. I think I shall not return until long after daylight, and then
  there will be no suspicions. Give me a token that will admit me safely back
  into Hanadra&mdash;some sign that the priests will know, and a pass to show
  to any one that bids me halt."</p>

  <p>The priest held out his hand. "Take off that ring of mine!" he answered.
  "That is the sacred ring of Kharvani&mdash;and all men know it. None will
  touch thee or refuse thee anything, do they have but the merest sight of
  it!"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar drew off a clumsy silver ring, set with three stones&mdash;
  a sapphire and a ruby and an emerald, each one of which was worth a fortune
  by itself. He slipped it on his own finger and turned it round slowly,
  examining it.</p>

  <p>"See how I trust thee," said the priest.</p>

  <p>"More than I do thee!" muttered the Risaldar.</p>

  <p>"I hear my brother!" growled the Risaldar after another minute. "Be ready
  to show the way!"</p>

  <p>He walked across the room to Ruth, tore a covering from a divan and
  wrapped her in it; then he opened the outer door for his half-brother.</p>

  <p>"Is it well?" he asked in the Rajput tongue.</p>

  <p>"All well!" boomed the half-brother, eying the unbound priest with
  unconcealed surprise.</p>

  <p>"Do any watch?"</p>

  <p>"Not one! The priests are in the temple; all who are not priests man the
  walls or rush here and there making ready."</p>

  <p>"And the priestling?"</p>

  <p>"Is where I left him."</p>

  <p>"Where?&mdash;I said."</p>

  <p>"In the niche underneath the arch, where I trapped the High Priest!"</p>

  <p>"Are the horses fed and watered?"</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Good! How is the niche opened where the priestling lies?"</p>

  <p>"There is the trunk of an elephant, carved where the largest stone of all
  begins to curve outward, on the side of the stone as you go outward from the
  courtyard."</p>

  <p>"On which side of the archway, then?"</p>

  <p>"On the left side, sahib. Press on the trunk downward and then pull; the
  stone swings outward. There are steps then&mdash;ten steps downward to the
  stone floor where the priestling lies."</p>

  <p>"Good! I can find him. Now pick up the heavenborn yonder in those great
  arms of thine, and bear her gently! Gently, I said! So! Have a care, now,
  that she is not injured against the corners. My honor, aye, my honor and
  yours and all our duty to the Raj you bear and&mdash;and have a care of the
  corners?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," answered the half-brother, stolidly, holding Ruth as though she had
  been a little bag of rice.</p>

  <p>Again the Risaldar turned to the High Priest, and eyed him through eyes
  that glittered.</p>

  <p>"We are ready!" he growled. "Lead on to thy hiding-place!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapB8"
     id="chapB8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The guns rode first from Doonha, for the guns take
  precedence. The section ground-scouts were acting scouts for the division,
  two hundred yards ahead of every one. Behind the guns rode Colonel
  Forrester-Carter, followed by the wagon with the wounded; and last of all the
  two companies of the Thirty-third trudged through the stifling heat.</p>

  <p>But, though the guns were ahead of every one, they had to suit their pace
  to that of the men who marched. For one thing, there might be an attack at
  any minute, and guns that are caught at close quarters at a distance from
  their escort are apt to be astonishingly helpless. They can act in unison
  with infantry; but alone, on bad ground, in the darkness, and with their
  horses nearly too tired to drag them, a leash of ten puppies in a crowd would
  be an easier thing to hurry with.</p>

  <p>Young Bellairs had his men dismounted and walking by their mounts. Even
  the drivers led their horses, for two had been taken from each gun to drag
  the wounded, and the guns are calculated as a load for six, not four.</p>

  <p>As he trudged through the blood-hot dust in clumsy riding-boots and led
  his charger on the left flank of the guns, Harry Bellairs fumed and fretted
  in a way to make no man envy him. The gloomy, ghost-like trees, that had
  flitted past him on the road to Doonha, crawled past him now&mdash;slowly
  and more slowly as his tired feet blistered in his boots. He could not mount
  and ride, though, for very shame, while his men were marching, and he dared
  not let them ride, for fear the horses might give in. He could just trudge
  and trudge, and hate himself and every one, and wonder.</p>

  <p>What had the Risaldar contrived to do? Why hadn't he packed up his wife's
  effects the moment that his orders came and ridden off with her and the
  section at once, instead of waiting three hours or more for an escort for
  her? Why hadn't he realized at once that orders that came in a hurry that
  way, in the night-time, were not only urgent but ominous as well? What chance
  had the Risaldar&mdash;an old man, however willing he might be&mdash;to
  ride through a swarming countryside for thirty miles or more and bring back
  an escort? Why, even supposing Mohammed Khan had ridden off at once, he could
  scarcely be back again before the section! And what would have happened in
  the meantime?</p>

  <p>Supposing the Risaldar's sons and grandsons refused to obey him? Stranger
  things than that had been known to happen! Suppose they were disloyal? And
  then&mdash;blacker though than any yet!&mdash;suppose&mdash;suppose
&mdash;Why had Mahommed Khan, the hard-bitten, wise old war-dog, advised
  him to leave his wife behind? Did that seem like honest advice, on second
  thought? Mohammedans had joined in this outbreak as well as Hindus. The
  sepoys at Doonha were Mohammedans! Why had Mahommed Khan seemed so anxious to
  send him on his way? As though an extra five minutes would have mattered! Why
  had he objected to a last good-by to Mrs. Bellairs? . . . And then&mdash;he
  had shown a certain knowledge of the uprising; where had he obtained it? If
  he were loyal, who then had told him of it? Natives who are disloyal don't
  brag of their plans beforehand to men who are on the other side! And if he
  had known of it, and was still loyal, how was it that he had not divulged his
  information before the outbreak came? Would a loyal man hold his tongue until
  the last minute? Scarcely!</p>

  <p>He halted, pulled his horse to the middle of the road and waited for
  Colonel Carter to overtake him.</p>

  <p>"Well? What is it?" asked the colonel sharply.</p>

  <p>"Can I ride on ahead, sir? My horse is good for it and I'm in agonies of
  apprehension about my wife!"</p>

  <p>"No! Certainly not! You are needed to command your section!"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but I've a sergeant who can take command. He's a
  first-class man and perfectly dependable."</p>

  <p>"You could do no good, even if you did ride on," said the colonel, not
  unkindly.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking, sir, that Mahommed Khan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Risaldar Mahommed Khan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Of the Rajput Horse?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. My father's Risaldar."</p>

  <p>"You left your wife in his charge, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, but I'm thinking that&mdash;that perhaps the Risaldar&mdash;
  I mean&mdash;there seem to be Mohammedans at the bottom of this business,
  as well as Hindus. Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bellairs! Now hear me once and for all. You thank your God that the
  Risaldar turned up to guard her! Thank God that your father was man enough
  for Mahommed Khan to love and that you are your father's son! And listen!
  Don't let me hear you, ever, under any circumstances, breathe a word of doubt
  as to that man's loyalty! D'you understand me, sir? You, a mere subaltern, a
  puppy just out of his 'teens, an insignificant jackanapes with two
  twelve-pounders in your charge, daring to impute disloyalty to Mahommed Khan!
&mdash;your impudence! Remember this! That old Risaldar is the man who rode
  with your father through the guns at Dera! He's a pauper without a pension,
  for all his loyalty, but he went down the length of India to meet you, at his
  own expense, when you landed raw-green from England! And what d'you know of
  war, I'd like to know, that you didn't learn from him? Thank your God, sir,
  that there's some one there who'll kill your wife before she falls into the
  Hindus' hands!"</p>

  <p>"But he was going to ride away, sir, to bring an escort!"</p>

  <p>"Not before he'd made absolutely certain of her safety!" swore the colonel
  with conviction. "Join your section, sir!"</p>

  <p>So Harry Bellairs joined his section and trudged along sore-footed at its
  side&mdash;sore-hearted, too. He wondered whether any one would ever say as
  much for him as Colonel Carter had chosen to say for Mahommed Khan, or
  whether any one would have the right to say it! He was ashamed of having left
  his wife behind and tortured with anxiety&mdash;and smarting from the snub
&mdash;a medley of sensations that were more likely to make a man of him, if
  he had known it, than the whole experience of a year's campaign! But in the
  dust and darkness, with the blisters on his heels, and fifty men, who had
  overheard the colonel, looking sidewise at him, his plight was pitiable.</p>

  <p>They trudged until the dawn began to rise, bright yellow below the
  drooping banyan trees; only Colonel Carter and the advance-guard riding.
  Then, when they stopped at a stream to water horses and let them graze a bit
  and give the men a sorely needed rest, one of the ring of outposts loosed off
  his rifle and shouted an alarm. They had formed square in an instant, with
  the guns on one side and the men on three, and the colonel and the wounded in
  the middle. A thousand or more of the mutineers leaned on their rifles on the
  shoulder of a hill and looked them over, a thousand yards away.</p>

  <p>"Send them an invitation!" commanded Colonel Carter, and the left-hand gun
  barked out an overture, killing one sepoy. The rest made off in the direction
  of Hanadra.</p>

  <p>"We're likely to have a hot reception when we reach there!" said Colonel
  Carter cheerily. "Well, we'll rest here for thirty minutes and give them a
  chance to get ready for us. I'm sorry there's no breakfast, men, but the
  sepoys will have dinner ready by the time we get there&mdash;we'll eat
  theirs!"</p>

  <p>The chorus of ready laughter had scarcely died away when a horse's hoof-
  beats clattered in the distance from the direction of Doonha and a native
  cavalryman galloped into view, low-bent above his horse's neck. The foam from
  his horse was spattered over him and his lance swung pointing upward from the
  sling. On his left side the polished scabbard rose and fell in time to his
  horse's movement. He was urging his weary horse to put out every ounce he had
  in him. He drew rein, though, when he reached a turning in the road and saw
  the resting division in front of him, and walked his horse forward, patting
  his sweat-wet neck and easing him. But as he leaned to finger with the girths
  an ambushed sepoy fired at him, and he rammed in his spurs again and rode
  like a man possessed.</p>

  <p>"This'll be another untrustworthy Mohammedan!" said Colonel Carter in a
  pointed undertone, and Bellairs blushed crimson underneath the tan. "He's
  ridden through from Jundhra, with torture waiting for him if he happened to
  get caught, and no possible reward beyond his pay. Look out he doesn't spike
  your guns!"</p>

  <p>The trooper rode straight up to Colonel Carter and saluted. He removed a
  tiny package from his cheek, where he had carried it so that he might swallow
  it at once in case of accident, tore the oil-silk cover from it and handed it
  to him without a word, saluting again and leading his horse away. Colonel
  Carter unfolded the half-sheet of foreign notepaper and read:</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Colonel Carter:<br>
  <br>
  Your letter just received in which you say that you have blown up the
  magazine at Doonha and are marching to Hanadra with a view to the rescue of
  Mrs. Bellairs. This is in no sense intended as a criticism of your action or
  of your plan, but circumstances have made it seem advisable for me to
  transfer my own headquarters to Hanadra and I am just starting. I must ask
  you, please, to wait for me&mdash;at a spot as near to where this overtakes
  you as can be managed. If Mrs. Bellairs, or anybody else of ours, is in
  Hanadra, she&mdash;or they&mdash;are either dead by now or else
  prisoners. And if they are to be rescued by force, the larger the force
  employed the better. If you were to attack with your two companies before I
  reached you, you probably would be repulsed, and would, I think, endanger the
  lives of any prisoners that the enemy may hold. I am coming with my whole
  command as fast as possible.<br>
  <br>
  Your Obedient Servant,<br>
  <br>
  A. E. Turner Genl. Officer Commanding</p>

  <p>"Men!" said Colonel Carter, in a ringing voice that gave not the slightest
  indication of his feelings, "we're to wait here for a while until the whole
  division overtakes us. The general has vacated Jundhra. Lie down and get all
  the rest you can!"</p>

  <p>The murmur from the ranks was as difficult to read as Colonel Carter's
  voice had been. It might have meant pleasure at the thought of rest, or
  anger, or contempt, or almost anything. It was undefined and indefinable.</p>

  <p>But there was no doubt at all as to how young Bellairs felt. He was
  sitting on a trunnion, sobbing, with his head bent low between his hands.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapB9"
     id="chapB9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Come, then!" said the High Priest.</p>

  <p>Mahommed Khan threw open the outer door and bowed sardonically.
  "Precedence for priests!" he sneered, tapping at his sword-hilt. "Thou goest
  first! Next come I, and last Suliman with the memsahib! Thus can I reach thee
  with my sword, O priest, and also protect her if need be!"</p>

  <p>"Thou art trusting as a little child!" exclaimed the priest, passing out
  ahead of him.</p>

  <p>"A priest and a liar and a thief&mdash;all three are one!" hummed the
  Risaldar. "Bear her gently, Suliman! Have a care, now, as you turn on the
  winding stairs!"</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib!" said the half-brother, carrying Ruth as easily as though she
  had been a little child.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the stairway, in the blackness that seemed alive with
  phantom shadows, the High Priest paused and listened, stretching out his left
  hand against the wall to keep the other two behind him. From somewhere beyond
  the courtyard came the din of hurrying sandaled feet, scudding over
  cobblestones in one direction. The noise was incessant and not unlike the
  murmur of a rapid stream. Occasionally a voice was raised in some command or
  other, but the stream of sound continued, hurrying, hurrying, shuffling along
  to the southward.</p>

  <p>"This way and watch a while," whispered the priest.</p>

  <p>"I have heard rats run that way!" growled the Risaldar.</p>

  <p>They climbed up a narrow stairway leading to a sort of battlement and
  peered over the top, Suliman laying Ruth Bellairs down in the darkest shadow
  he could find. She was beginning to recover consciousness, and apparently
  Mahommed Khan judged it best to take no notice of her.</p>

  <p>Down below them they could see the city gate, wide open, with a blazing
  torch on either side of it, and through the gate, swarming like ants before
  the rains, there poured an endless stream of humans that marched&mdash;and
  marched&mdash;and marched; four, ten, fifteen abreast; all heights and
  sizes, jumbled in and out among one another, anyhow, without formation, but
  armed, every one of them, and all intent on marching to the southward, where
  Jundhra and Doonha lay. Some muttered to one another and some laughed, but
  the greater number marched in silence.</p>

  <p>"That for thy English!" grinned the priest. "Can the English troops
  overcome that horde?"</p>

  <p>"Hey-ee! For a troop or two of Rajputs!" sighed the Risaldar. "Or English
  Lancers! They would ride through that as an ax does through the
  brush-wood!"</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said the priest. "All soldiers boast! There will be a houghing
  shortly after dawn. The days of thy English are now numbered."</p>

  <p>"By those&mdash;there?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, by those, there! Come!"</p>

  <p>They climbed down the steps again, the Rajput humming to himself and
  smiling grimly into his mustache.</p>

  <p>"Ay! There will be a houghing shortly after dawn!" he muttered. "Would
  only that I were there to see! . . . Where are the sepoys?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I know not. How should I know, who have been thy guest these hours past?
  This march is none of my ordering."</p>

  <p>The priest pressed hard on a stone knob that seemed to be part of the
  carving on a wall, then he leaned his weight against the wall and a huge
  stone swung inward, while a fetid breath of air wafted outward in their
  faces.</p>

  <p>"None know this road but I!" exclaimed the priest.</p>

  <p>"None need to!" said the Risaldar. "Pass on, snake, into thy hole. We
  follow."</p>

  <p>"Steps!" said the priest, and began descending.</p>

  <p>"Curses!" said the Risaldar, stumbling and falling down on top of him.
  "Have a care, Suliman! The stone is wet and slippery."</p>

  <p>Down, down they climbed, one behind the other, Suliman grunting beneath
  his burden and the Risaldar keeping up a running fire of oaths. Each time
  that he slipped, and that was often, he cursed the priest and cautioned
  Suliman. But the priest only laughed, and apparently Suliman was sure-footed,
  for he never stumbled once. They seemed to be diving down into the bowels of
  the earth. They were in pitch-black darkness, for the stone had swung to
  behind them of its own accord. The wall on either side of them was wet with
  slime and the stink of decaying ages rose and almost stifled them. But the
  priest kept on descending, so fast that the other two had trouble to keep up
  with him, and he hummed to himself as though he knew the road and liked
  it.</p>

  <p>"The bottom!" he called back suddenly. "From now the going is easy, until
  we rise again. We pass now under the city-wall."</p>

  <p>But they could see nothing and hear nothing except their own footfalls
  swishing in the ooze beneath them. Even the priest's words seemed to be lost
  at once, as though he spoke into a blanket, for the air they breathed was
  thicker than a mist and just as damp. They walked on, along a level, wet,
  stone passage for at least five minutes, feeling their way with one band on
  the wall.</p>

  <p>"Steps, now!" said the priest. "Have a care, now, for the lower ones are
  slippery."</p>

  <p>Ruth was regaining consciousness. She began to move and tried once or
  twice to speak.</p>

  <p>"Here, thou!" growled the Risaldar. "Thou art a younger man than I&mdash;
  come back here. Help with the memsahib."</p>

  <p>The priest came back a step or two, but Suliman declined his aid, snarling
  vile insults at him.</p>

  <p>"I can manage!" he growled. "Get thou behind me, Mahommed Khan, in case I
  slip!"</p>

  <p>So Mahommed Khan came last, and they slipped and grunted upward, round and
  round a spiral staircase that was hewn out of solid rock. No light came
  through from anywhere to help them, but the priest climbed on, as though he
  were accustomed to the stair and knew the way from constant use. After five
  minutes of steady climbing the stone grew gradually dry. The steps became
  smaller, too, and deeper, and not so hard to climb. Suddenly the priest
  reached out his arm and pulled at something or other that hung down in the
  darkness. A stone in the wall rolled open. A flood of light burst in and
  nearly blinded them.</p>

  <p>"We are below Kharvani's temple!" announced the priest. He led them
  through the opening into a four-square room hewn from the rock below the
  foundations of the temple some time in the dawn of history. The light that
  had blinded them when they first emerged proved to be nothing but the flicker
  of two small oil lamps that hung suspended by brass chains from the painted
  ceiling. The only furniture was mats spread on the cut-stone floor.</p>

  <p>"By which way did we come?" asked the Risaldar, staring in amazement round
  the walls. There was not a door nor crack, nor any sign of one, except that a
  wooden ladder in one corner led to a trapdoor overhead, and they had
  certainly not entered by the ladder.</p>

  <p>"Nay! That is a secret!" grinned the priest. "He who can may find the
  opening! Here can the woman and her servant stay until we need them."</p>

  <p>"Here in this place?"</p>

  <p>"Where else? No man but I knows of this crypt! The ladder there leads to
  another room, where there is yet another ladder, and that one leads out
  through a secret door I know of, straight into the temple. Art ready? There
  is need for haste!"</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said the Risaldar.</p>

  <p>"These soldiers!" sneered the priest. "It is wait&mdash;wait&mdash;
  wait with them, always!"</p>

  <p>"Hast thou a son."</p>

  <p>"Ay! But what of it?"</p>

  <p>"I said 'hast,' not 'hadst'!"</p>

  <p>"Ay. I have a son.</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"In one of the temple-chambers overhead."</p>

  <p>"Nay, priest! Thy son lies gagged and bound and trussed in a place I know
  of, and which thou dost not know!"</p>

  <p>"Since when?"</p>

  <p>"Since by my orders he was laid there."</p>

  <p>"Thou art the devil! Thou liest, Rajput!"</p>

  <p>"So? Go seek thy son!"</p>

  <p>The priest's face had blanched beneath the olive of his skin, and he
  stared at Mahommed Khan through distended eyes.</p>

  <p>"My son!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Aye! Thy priestling! He stays where he is, as hostage, until my return!
  Also the heavenborn stays here! If, on my return, I find the heavenborn safe
  and sound, I will exchange her for thy son&mdash;and if not, I will tear
  thy son into little pieces before thy eyes, priest! Dost thou
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Thou liest! My son is overhead in the temple here!"</p>

  <p>"Go seek him, then!"</p>

  <p>The priest turned and scampered up the ladder with an agility that was
  astonishing in a man of his build and paunch.</p>

  <p>"Hanuman should have been thy master!" jeered the Risaldar. "So run the
  bandar-log, the monkey-folk!"</p>

  <p>But the priest had no time to answer him. He was half frantic with the
  sickening fear of a father for his only son. He returned ten minutes later,
  panting, and more scared than ever.</p>

  <p>"Go, take thy white woman," he exclaimed, "and give me my son back!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, priest! Shall I ride with her alone through that horde that are
  marching through the gate? I go now for an escort; in eight&mdash;ten
&mdash;twelve&mdash;I know not how many hours, I will return for her, and
  then&mdash;thy son will be exchanged for her, or he dies thus in many
  pieces!"</p>

  <p>He turned to Suliman. "Is she awake yet?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Barely, but she recovers."</p>

  <p>"Then tell her, when consciousness returns, that I have gone and will
  return for her. And stay here, thou, and guard her until I come."</p>

  <p>"Ha, sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Now, show the way!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" said the priest, "our bargain? The price that we agreed on
&mdash;one lakh, was it not?"</p>

  <p>"One lakh of devils take thee and tear thee into little pieces! Wouldst
  bribe a Rajput, a Risaldar? For that insult I will repay thee one day with
  interest, O priest! Now, show the way!"</p>

  <p>"But how shall I be sure about my son?"</p>

  <p>"Be sure that the priestling will starve to death or die of thirst or
  choke, unless I hurry! He is none too easy where he lies!"</p>

  <p>"Go! Hurry, then!" swore the priest. "May all the gods there are, and thy
  Allah with them, afflict thee with all their curses&mdash;thee and thine!
  Up with you! Up that ladder! Run! But, if the gods will, I will meet thee
  again when the storm is over!"</p>

  <p>"Inshallah!" growled Mahommed Khan.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later a crash and a clatter and a shower of sparks broke out
  in the sweltering courtyard where the guns had stood and waited. It was
  Shaitan, young Bellairs' Khaubuli charger, with his haunches under him,
  plunging across the flagstones, through the black-dark archway, out on the
  plain beyond&mdash;in answer to the long, sharp-roweled spurs of the
  Risaldar Mahommed Khan.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapB10"
     id="chapB10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dawn broke and the roofs of old Hanadra became resplendent
  with the varied colors of turbans and pugrees and shawls. As though the
  rising sun had loosed the spell, a myriad tongues, of women chiefly, rose in
  a babel of clamor, and the few men who had been left in. Hanadra by the
  night's armed exodus came all together and growled prophetically in
  undertones. Now was the day of days, when that part of India, at least,
  should cast off the English yoke.</p>

  <p>To the temple! The cry went up before the sun was fifteen minutes high.
  There are a hundred temples in Hanadra, age-old all of them and carved on the
  outside with strange images of heathen gods in high relief, like molds turned
  inside out. But there is but one temple that that cry could mean&mdash;
  Kharvani's; and there could be but one meaning for the cry. Man, woman and
  child would pray Kharvani, Bride of Siva the Destroyer, to intercede with
  Siva and cause him to rise and smite the English. On the skyline, glinting
  like flashed signals in the early sun, bright English bayonets had appeared;
  and between them and Hanadra was a dense black mass, the whole of old
  Hanadra's able-bodied manhood, lined up to defend the city. Now was the time
  to pray. Fifty to one are by no means despicable odds, but the aid of the
  gods as well is better!</p>

  <p>So the huge dome of Kharvani's temple began to echo to the sound of
  slippered feet and awe-struck whisperings, and the big, dim auditorium soon
  filled to overflowing. No light came in from the outer world. There was
  nothing to illuminate the mysteries except the chain-hung grease-lamps
  swinging here and there from beams, and they served only to make the darkness
  visible. Bats flicked in and out between them and disappeared in the echoing
  gloom above. Censers belched out sweet-smelling, pungent clouds of sandalwood
  to drown the stench of hot humanity; and the huge graven image of Kharvani
&mdash;serene and smiling and indifferent&mdash;stared round-eyed from the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>Then a priest's voice boomed out in a solemn incantation and the
  whispering hushed. He chanted age-old verses, whose very meaning was
  forgotten in the womb of time&mdash;forgotten as the artist who had painted
  the picture of idealized Kharvani on the wall. Ten priests, five on either
  side of the tremendous idol, emerged chanting from the gloom behind, and then
  a gong rang, sweetly, clearly, suddenly, and the chanting ceased. Out stepped
  the High Priest from a niche below the image, and his voice rose in a
  wailing, sing-song cadence that reechoed from the dome and sent a thrill
  through every one who heard.</p>

  <p>His chant had scarcely ceased when the temple door burst open and a man
  rushed in.</p>

  <p>"They have begun!" he shouted. "The battle has begun!"</p>

  <p>As though in ready confirmation of his words, the distant reverberating
  boom of cannon filtered through the doorway from the world of grim realities
  outside.</p>

  <p>"They have twenty cannon with them! They have more guns than we have!"
  wailed he who brought the news. Again began the chanting that sought the aid
  of Siva the Destroyer. Only, there were fewer who listened to this second
  chant. Those who were near the doorway slipped outside and joined the
  watching hundreds on the roofs.</p>

  <p>For an hour the prayers continued in the stifling gloom, priest relieving
  priest and chant following on chant, until the temple was half emptied of its
  audience. One by one, and then by twos and threes, the worshipers succumbed
  to human curiosity and crept stealthily outside to watch.</p>

  <p>Another messenger ran in and shouted: "They have charged! Their cavalry
  have charged! They are beaten back! Their dead lie twisted on the plain!"</p>

  <p>At the words there was a stampede from the doorway, and half of those who
  had remained rushed out. There were hundreds still there, though, for that
  great gloomy pile of Kharvani's could hold an almost countless crowd.</p>

  <p>Within another hour the same man rushed to the door again and shouted:</p>

  <p>"Help comes! Horsemen are coming from the north! Rajputs, riding like
  leaves before the wind! Even the Moslems are for us!"</p>

  <p>But the chanting never ceased. No one stopped to doubt the friendship of
  arrivals from the north, for to that side there were no English, and
  England's friends would surely follow byroads to her aid. The city gates were
  wide open to admit wounded or messengers or friends&mdash;with a view,
  even, to a possible retreat&mdash;and whoever cared could ride through them
  unchallenged and unchecked.</p>

  <p>Even when the crash of horses' hoofs rattled on the stone paving outside
  the temple there was no suspicion. No move was made to find out who it was
  who rode. But when the temple door reechoed to the thunder of a sword-hilt
  and a voice roared "Open!" there was something like a panic. The chanting
  stopped and the priests and the High Priest listened to the stamping on the
  stone pavement at the temple front.</p>

  <p>"Open!" roared a voice again, and the thundering on the panels
  recommenced. Then some one drew the bolt and a horse's head&mdash;a huge
  Khaubuli stallion's&mdash;appeared, snorting and panting and wild-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Farward!" roared the Risaldar Mahommed Khan, kneeling on young Bellairs'
  winded charger.</p>

  <p>"Farm twos! Farward!"</p>

  <p>Straight into the temple, two by two, behind the Risaldar, rode two fierce
  lines of Rajputs, overturning men and women&mdash;their drawn swords
  pointing this way and that&mdash;their dark eyes gleaming. Without a word
  to any one they rode up to the image, where the priests stood in an
  astonished herd.</p>

  <p>"Fron-tt farm! Rear rank&mdash;'bout-face!" barked the Risaldar, and
  there was another clattering and stamping on the stone floor as the panting
  chargers pranced into the fresh formation, back to back.</p>

  <p>"The memsahib!" growled Mahommed Khan. "Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"My son!" said the High Priest. "Bring me my son!"</p>

  <p>"A life for a life! Thy heavenborn first!"</p>

  <p>"Nay! Show me my son first!"</p>

  <p>The Risaldar leaped from his horse and tossed his reins to the man behind
  him. In a second his sword was at the High Priest's throat.</p>

  <p>"Where is that secret stair?" he growled. "Lead on!"</p>

  <p>The swordpoint pricked him. Two priests tried to interfere, but wilted and
  collapsed with fright as four fierce, black-bearded Rajputs spurred their
  horses forward. The swordpoint pricked still deeper.</p>

  <p>"My son!" said the High Priest.</p>

  <p>"A life for a life! Lead on!"</p>

  <p>The High Priest surrendered, with a dark and cunning look, though, that
  hinted at something or other in reserve. He pulled at a piece of carving on
  the wail behind and pointed to a stair that showed behind the outswung door.
  Then he plucked another priest by the sleeve and whispered.</p>

  <p>The priest passed on the whisper. A third priest turned and ran.</p>

  <p>"That way!" said the High Priest, pointing.</p>

  <p>"I? Nay! I go not down!" He raised his voice into an ululating howl. "O
  Suliman!" he bellowed. "Suliman! O!&mdash;Suliman! Bring up the heaven-
  born!"</p>

  <p>A growl like the distant rumble from a bear-pit answered him. Then Ruth
  Bellairs' voice was heard calling up the stairway.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Mahommed Khan?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, memsahib!"</p>

  <p>"Good! I'm coming!"</p>

  <p>She had recovered far enough to climb the ladder and the steep stone stair
  above it, and Suliman climbed up behind her, grumbling dreadful prophecies of
  what would happen to the priests now that Mohammed Khan had come.</p>

  <p>"Is all well, Risaldar?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"Nay, heavenborn! All is not well yet! The general sahib from Jundhra and
  your husband's guns and others, making one division, are engaged with rebels
  eight or nine miles from here. We saw part of the battle as we rode!"</p>

  <p>"Who wins?"</p>

  <p>"It is doubtful, heavenborn! How could we tell from this distance?"</p>

  <p>"Have you a horse for me?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, heavenborn! Here! Bring up that horse, thou, and Suliman's! Ride him
  cross-saddle, heavenborn&mdash;there were no side-saddles in Siroeh! Nay,
  he is just a little frightened. He will stand&mdash;he will not throw thee!
  I did better than I thought, heavenborn. I come with four-and-twenty, making
  twenty-six with me and Suliman. An escort for a queen! So&mdash;sit him
  quietly. Leave the reins free. Suliman will lead him! Ho! Fronnnt! Rank
&mdash;'bout-face!"</p>

  <p>"My son!" wailed the High Priest. "Where is my son?"</p>

  <p>"Tell him, Suliman!"</p>

  <p>"Where I caught thee, thou idol-briber!" snarled the Risaldar's half-
  brother.</p>

  <p>"Where? In that den of stinks. Gagged and bound all this while?"</p>

  <p>"Ha! Gagged and bound and out of mischief where all priests and priests'
  sons ought to be!" laughed Mahommed Khan. "Farward! Farm twos
  Ter-r-r-ott!"</p>

  <p>In went the spur, and the snorting, rattling, clanking cavalcade sidled
  and pranced out of the temple into the sunshine, with Ruth and Suliman in the
  midst of them.</p>

  <p>"Gallop!" roared the Risaldar, the moment that the last horse was clear of
  the temple-doors. And in that instant he saw what the High Priest's
  whispering had meant.</p>

  <p>Coming up the street toward them was a horde of silent, hurrying Hindus,
  armed with swords and spears, wearing all of them the caste-marks of the
  Brahman&mdash;well-fed, indignant relations of the priests, intent on
  avenging the defilement of Kharvani's temple.</p>

  <p>"Canter! Fronnnt&mdash;farm&mdash;Gallop! Charge!"</p>

  <p>Ruth found herself in the midst of a whirlwind of flashing sabers, astride
  of a lean-flanked Katiawari gelding that could streak like an antelope, knee
  to knee with a pair of bearded Rajputs, one of whom gripped her bridle-rein
&mdash;thundering down a city street straight for a hundred swords that
  blocked her path. She set her eyes on the middle of Mahommed Khan's straight
  back, gripped the saddle with both hands, set her teeth and waited for the
  shock. Mahommed Khan's right arm rose and his sword flashed in the sunlight
  as he stood up in his stirrups. She shut her eyes. But there was no shock!
  There was the swish of whirling steel, the thunder of hoofs, the sound of
  bodies falling. There was a scream or two as well and a coarse-mouthed Rajput
  oath. But when she dared to open her eyes once more they were thundering
  still, headlong down the city street and Mahommed Khan was whirling his sword
  in mid-air to shake the blood from it.</p>

  <p>Ahead lay the city gate and she could see another swarm of Hindus rushing
  from either side to close it. But "Charge!" yelled Mahommed Khan again, and
  they swept through the crowd, through the half-shut gate, out on the plain
  beyond, as a wind sweeps through the forest, leaving fallen tree-trunks in
  its wake.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" roared the Risaldar, when they were safely out of range. "Are any
  hurt? No? Good for us that their rifles are all in the firing-line
  yonder!"</p>

  <p>He sat for a minute peering underneath his hand at the distant, dark,
  serried mass of men and the steel-tipped lines beyond it, watching the
  belching cannon and the spurting flames of the close-range rifle-fire.</p>

  <p>"See, heavenborn!" he said, pointing. "Those will be your husband's guns!
  See, over on the left, there. See! They fire! Those two! We can reach them if
  we make a circuit on the flank here!"</p>

  <p>"But can we get through, Risaldar? Won't they see us and cut us off?"</p>

  <p>"Heavenborn!" he answered, "men who dare ride into a city temple and
  snatch thee from the arms of priests dare and can do anything! Take this,
  heavenborn&mdash;take it as a keepsake, in case aught happens!"</p>

  <p>He drew off the priest's ring, gave it to her and then, before she could
  reply:</p>

  <p>"Canter!" he roared. The horses sprang forward in answer to the spurs and
  there was nothing for Ruth to do but watch the distant battle and listen to
  the deep breathing of the Rajputs on either hand.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="chapB11"
     id="chapB11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There could be no retreat that day and no thought of it.
  Jundhra and Doonha were in ruins. The bridges were down behind them and
  Hanadra lay ahead. The British had to win their way into it or perish. Tired
  out, breakfastless, suffering from the baking heat, the long, thin British
  line had got&mdash;not to hold at bay but to smash and pierce&mdash;an
  overwhelming force of Hindus that was stiffened up and down its length by
  small detachments of native soldiers who had mutinied.</p>

  <p>Numbers were against them, and even superiority of weapons was not so
  overwhelmingly in their favor, for those were the days of short-range rifle-
  fire and smoothbore artillery, and one gun was considerably like another. The
  mutinous sepoys had their rifles with them; there were guns from the ramparts
  of Hanadra that were capable of quite efficient service at close range; and
  practically every man in the dense-packed rebel line had a firearm of some
  kind. It was only in cavalry and discipline and pluck that the British force
  had the advantage, and the cavalry had already charged once and had been
  repulsed.</p>

  <p>General Turner rode up and down the sweltering firing-line, encouraging
  the men when it seemed to him they needed it and giving directions to his
  officers. He was hidden from view oftener than not by the rolling clouds of
  smoke and he popped up here and there suddenly and unexpectedly. Wherever he
  appeared there was an immediate stiffening among the ranks, as though he
  carried a supply of spare enthusiasm with him and could hand it out.</p>

  <p>Colonel Carter, commanding the right wing, turned his head for a second at
  the sound of a horse's feet and found the general beside him.</p>

  <p>"Had I better have my wounded laid in a wagon, sir?" he suggested, "in
  case you find it necessary to fall back?"</p>

  <p>"There will be no retreat!" said General Turner. "Leave your wounded where
  they are. I never saw a cannon bleed before. How's that?"</p>

  <p>He spurred his horse over to where one of Bellairs' guns was being run
  forward into place again and Colonel Carter followed him. There was blood
  dripping from the muzzle of it.</p>

  <p>"We're short of water, sir!" said Colonel Carter.</p>

  <p>And as he spoke a gunner dipped his sponge into a pool of blood and rammed
  it home.</p>

  <p>Bellairs was standing between his two guns, looking like the shadow of
  himself, worn out with lack of sleep, disheveled, wounded. There was blood
  dripping from his forehead and he wore his left arm in a sling made from his
  shirt.</p>

  <p>"Fire!" he ordered, and the two guns barked in unison and jumped back two
  yards or more.</p>

  <p>"If you'll look," said General Turner, plucking at the colonel's sleeve,
  "you'll see a handful of native cavalry over yonder behind the enemy&mdash;
  rather to the enemy's left&mdash;there between those two clouds of smoke.
  D'you see them?"</p>

  <p>"They look like Sikhs or Rajputs," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Don't they? I'd like you to keep an eye on them. They've come up
  from the rear. I caught sight of them quite a while ago and I can't quite
  make them out. It's strange, but I can't believe that they belong to the
  enemy. D'you see?&mdash;there&mdash;they've changed direction. They're
  riding as though they intended to come round the enemy's left flank!"</p>

  <p>"By gad, they are! Look! The enemy are moving to cut them off!"</p>

  <p>"I must get back to the other wing!" said General Turner. "But that looks
  like the making of an opportunity! Keep both eyes lifting, Carter, and
  advance the moment you see any confusion in the enemy's ranks."</p>

  <p>He rode off, and Colonel Carter stared long and steadily at the
  approaching horsemen. He saw a dense mass of the enemy, about a thousand
  strong, detach itself from the left wing and move to intercept them, and he
  noticed that the movement made a tremendous difference to the ranks opposed
  to him. He stepped up to young Bellairs and touched his sleeve. Bellairs
  started like a man roused from a dream.</p>

  <p>"That's your wife over there!" said Colonel Carter. "There can't be any
  other white woman here-abouts riding with a Rajput escort!"</p>

  <p>Bellairs gripped the colonel's outstretched arm.</p>

  <p>"Where?" he almost screamed. "Where? I don't see her!"</p>

  <p>"There, man! There, where that mass of men is moving! Look! By the Lord
  Harry! He's charging right through the mob! That's Mahommed Khan, I'll bet a
  fortune! Now's our chance Bugler!"</p>

  <p>The bugler ran to him, and he began to puff into his instrument.</p>

  <p>"Blow the 'attention' first!"</p>

  <p>Out rang the clear, strident notes, and the non-commissioned officers and
  men took notice that a movement of some kind would shortly be required of
  them, but the din of firing never ceased for a single instant. Then,
  suddenly, an answering bugle sang out from the other flank.</p>

  <p>"Advance in echelon!" commanded Colonel Carter, and the bugler did his
  best to split his cheeks in a battle-rending blast.</p>

  <p>"You remain where you are, sir!" he ordered young Bellairs. "Keep your
  guns served to the utmost!"</p>

  <p>Six-and-twenty horsemen, riding full-tilt at a thousand men, may look like
  a trifle, but they are disconcerting. What they hit, they kill; and if they
  succeed in striking home, they play old Harry with formations. And Risaldar
  Mahommed Khan did strike home. He changed direction suddenly and, instead of
  using up his horses' strength in outflanking the enemy, who had marched to
  intercept him, and making a running target of his small command, he did the
  unexpected&mdash;which is the one best thing to do in war. He led his
  six-and-twenty at a headlong gallop straight for the middle of the crowd
&mdash;it could not be called by any military name. They fired one ragged
  volley at him and then had no time to load before he was in the middle of
  them, clashing right and left and pressing forward. They gave way, right and
  left, before him, and a good number of them ran. Half a hundred of them were
  cut down as they fled toward their firing-line. At that second, just as the
  Risaldar and his handful burst through the mob and the mob began rushing
  wildly out of his way, the British bugles blared out the command to advance
  in echelon.</p>

  <p>The Indians were caught between a fire and a charge that they had good
  reason to fear in front of them, and a disturbance on their left flank that
  might mean anything. As one-half of them turned wildly to face what might be
  coming from this unexpected quarter, the British troops came on with a roar,
  and at the same moment Mahommed Khan reached the rear of their firing-line
  and crashed headlong into it.</p>

  <p>In a second the whole Indian line was in confusion and in another minute
  it was in full retreat not knowing nor even guessing what had routed it.
  Retreat grew into panic and panic to stampede and, five minutes after the
  Risaldar's appearance on the scene, half of the Indian line was rushing
  wildly for Hanadra and the other half was retiring sullenly in comparatively
  dense and decent order.</p>

  <p>Bellairs could not see all that happened. The smoke from his own guns
  obscured the view, and the necessity for giving orders to his men prevented
  him from watching as he would have wished. But he saw the Rajputs burst out
  through the Indian ranks and he saw his own charger&mdash;Shaitan the
  unmistakable&mdash;careering across the plain toward him riderless.</p>

  <p>"For the love of God!" he groaned, raising both fists to heaven, "has she
  got this far, and then been killed! Oh, what in Hades did I entrust her to an
  Indian for? The pig-headed, brave old fool! Why couldn't he ride round them,
  instead of charging through?"</p>

  <p>As he groaned aloud, too wretched even to think of what his duty was, a
  galloper rode up to him.</p>

  <p>"Bring up your guns, sir, please!" he ordered. "You're asked to hurry!
  Take up position on that rising ground and warm up the enemy's retreat!"</p>

  <p>"Limber up!" shouted Bellairs, coming to himself again. Fifteen seconds
  later his two guns were thundering up the rise.</p>

  <p>As he brought them to "action front" and tried to collect his thoughts to
  figure out the range, a finger touched his shoulder and he turned to see
  another artillery officer standing by him.</p>

  <p>"I've been lent from another section," he explained: "You're wanted."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Over there, where you see Colonel Carter standing. It's your wife wants
  you, I think!"</p>

  <p>Bellairs did not wait for explanations. He sent for his horse and mounted
  and rode across the intervening space at a breakneck gallop that he could
  barely stop in time to save himself from knocking the colonel over. A second
  later he was in Ruth's arms.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were dead when I saw Shaitan!" he said. He was nearly
  sobbing.</p>

  <p>"No, Mahommed Khan rode him," she answered, and she made no pretense about
  not sobbing. She was crying like a child.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Bellairs sahib!" said a weak voice close to him. He noticed
  Colonel Carter bending over a prostrate figure, lifting the head up on his
  knee. There were three Rajputs standing between, though, and he could not see
  whose the figure was.</p>

  <p>"Come over here!" said Colonel Carter, and young Bellairs obeyed him,
  leaving Ruth sitting on the ground where she was.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you care to thank Mohammed Khan?" It was a little cruel of the
  colonel to put quite so much venom in his voice, for, when all is said and
  done: a man has almost a right to be forgetful when he has just had his young
  wife brought him out of the jaws of death. At least he has a good excuse for
  it. The sting of the reproof left him bereft of words and he stood looking
  down at the old Risaldar, saying nothing and feeling very much ashamed.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, Bellairs sahib!" The voice was growing feebler. "I would have
  done more for thy father's son! Thou art welcome. Aie! But thy charger is a
  good one! Good-by! Time is short, and I would talk with the colonel
  sahib!"</p>

  <p>He waved Bellairs away with a motion of his hand and the lieutenant went
  back to his wife again.</p>

  <p>"He sent me away just like that, too!" she told him. "He said he had no
  time left to talk to women!"</p>

  <p>Colonel Carter bent down again above the Risaldar, and listened to as much
  as he had time to tell of what had happened.</p>

  <p>"But couldn't you have ridden round them, Risaldar?" he asked them.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sahib! It was touch and go! I gave the touch! I saw as I rode how
  close the issue was and I saw my chance and took it! Had the memsahib been
  slain, she had at least died in full view of the English&mdash;and there
  was a battle to be won. What would you? I am a soldier&mdash;I."</p>

  <p>"Indeed you are!" swore Colonel Carter.</p>

  <p>"Sahib! Call my sons!"</p>

  <p>His sons were standing near him, but the colonel called up his grandsons,
  who had been told to stand at a little distance off. They clustered round the
  Risaldar in silence, and he looked them over and counted them.</p>

  <p>"All here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"All here!"</p>

  <p>"Whose sons and grandsons are ye?"</p>

  <p>"Thine!" came the chorus.</p>

  <p>"This sahib says that having done my bidding and delivered her ye rode to
  rescue, ye are no more bound to the Raj. Ye may return to your homes if ye
  wish."</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Ye may fight for the rebels, if ye wish! There will be a safe-permit
  written."</p>

  <p>Again there was no answer.</p>

  <p>"For whom, then, fight ye?"</p>

  <p>"For the Raj!" The deep-throated answer rang out promptly from every one
  of them, and they stood with their sword-hilts thrust out toward the colonel.
  He rose and touched each hilt in turn.</p>

  <p>"They are now thy servants!" said the Risaldar, laying his head back. "It
  is good! I go now. Give my salaams to General Turner sahib!"</p>

  <p>"Good-by, old war-dog!" growled the colonel, in an Anglo-Saxon effort to
  disguise emotion. He gripped at the right hand that was stretched out on the
  ground beside him, but it was lifeless.</p>

  <p>Risaldar Mahommed Khan, two-medal man and pensionless gentleman-at-large,
  had gone to turn in his account of how he had remembered the salt which he
  had eaten.</p>

  <h2><a name="chapC1"
     id="chapC1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

  <p>Waist-held in the chains and soused in the fifty-foot-high spray, Joe Byng
  eyed his sounding lead that swung like a pendulum below him, and named it
  sacrilege.</p>

  <p>"This 'ere navy ain't a navy no more," he muttered. "This 'ere's a school-
  gal promenade, 'and-in-'and, an' mind not to get your little trotters wet,
  that's what this is, so 'elp me two able seamen an' a red marine!"</p>

  <p>From the moment that the lookout, lashed to the windlass drum up forward,
  had spied the little craft away to leeward and had bellowed his report of it
  through hollowed hands between the thunder of the waves, Joe Byng had had
  premonitory symptoms of uneasiness. He had felt in his bones that the navy
  was about to be nose-led into shame.</p>

  <p>At the wheel, both eyes on the compass, as the sea law bids, but both ears
  on the more-even-than-usual-alert, Curley Crothers felt the same sensations
  but expressed them otherwise.</p>

  <p>"Admiral's orders!" he muttered. "Maybe the admiral was drunk?"</p>

  <p>The brass gongs clanged down in the bowels of H.M.S. Puncher and she
  gradually lost what little weigh she had, rolling her bridge ends under in
  the heave and hollow of a beam-on monsoon sea.</p>

  <p>"How much does he say he wants?" asked her commander.</p>

  <p>Joe Byng in the chains and Curley Crothers at the wheel both recognized
  the quarter tone instantly, and diagnosed it with deadly accuracy; every
  vibration of his voice and every fiber of his being expressed exasperation,
  though a landsman might have noticed no more than contempt for what he had
  seen fit to log as "half a gale."</p>

  <p>"He says he'll take us in for fifty pounds, sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Tell him to make it shillings, or else to get out of my course!"</p>

  <p>It is not much in the way of Persian Gulf Arabic that a man picks up from
  textbooks but at garnering the business end of beach-born dialects &mdash;
  the end that gets results at least expense of time or energy &mdash; the Navy
  goes even the Army half a dozen better. The sublieutenant's argument, bawled
  from the bridge rail to the reeling little boat below, was a marvel in its
  own sweet way; it combined abuse and scorn with a cataclysmic blast of threat
  in six explosive sentences.</p>

  <p>"He says he'll take us in for ten pounds, sir," he reported, without the
  vestige of a smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Ask Mr. Hartley to step up on the bridge, will you?"</p>

  <p>Two minutes later, during which the nasal howls from the boat were utterly
  ignored, the acting chief engineer hauled himself along the rail hand over
  hand to windward, ducking below the canvas guard as a more than usually big
  comber split against the Puncher's side and hove itself to heaven.</p>

  <p>"It beats me how any man can keep a coat on him this weather," he
  remarked, and the sublieutenant noticed that the streams that ran down both
  his temples were not sea water. "Send for me?"</p>

  <p>His temper, judging by his voice, would seem to be a lot worse than could
  be due to the pitching of the ship.</p>

  <p>"Yes. There's a pilot overside, and our orders are to take a pilot aboard
  when running in, if available. There are three men bailing that boat below
  there, and the sea's gaining on them. They'll need rescuing within two hours.
  Then we'd have a pilot aboard and would have saved the government ten pounds.
  Point is, can you manage in the engine-room for two or three hours longer?
  Three more waves like that last one and the man's ours anyway!"</p>

  <p>"He might not wait two hours," suggested Mr. Hartley. "He might get tired
  of looking at us, and beat back into port. Then where would be your
  strategy?"</p>

  <p>"Then there wouldn't be a pilot available. I'd be justified in going in
  without one. Point is, can you hold out below?"</p>

  <p>"Man," said Mr. Hartley, "you're a genius." He peered through the spray
  down to leeward, where the pilot's boat danced a death dance alongside, heel
  and toe to the Puncher's statelier swing. "Yes; there are three men bailing,
  and you're a genius. But no! The answer's no! The engines'll keep on turning,
  maybe and perhaps, until we make the shelter o' yon reef. There's no knowing
  what a cherry-red bearing will do. I can give ye maybe fifteen knots; maybe a
  leetle more for just five minutes, for steerage way and luck, and after
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Even crouched as he was against the canvas guard he contrived to shrug his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"But if we go in there are you sure you can contrive to patch her up? It
  looks like a rotten passage, and not much of a berth beyond it."</p>

  <p>"I could cool her down."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if that's all you want, I can anchor outside in thirty fathoms."</p>

  <p>Curley Crothers heard that and his whole frame stiffened; there seemed a
  chance yet that the Navy might not be disgraced. But it faded on the
  instant.</p>

  <p>"Man, we've got to go inside and we've got to hurry! Better in there than
  at the bottom of the Gulf! Put her where she'll hold still for a day, or
  maybe two days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say a month!" suggested the commander caustically.</p>

  <p>"Say three days for the sake of argument. Then I can put her to rights. I
  daren't take down a thing while she's rolling twenty-five and more, and I've
  got to take things down! Why, man, the engine-room is all pollution from
  gratings to bilge; if I loosened one more bolt than is loose a'ready her
  whole insides 'ud take charge and dance quadrilles until we drowned!"</p>

  <p>"You won't try to make Bombay?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try to give ye steam as far as the far side o' yon reef. After that
  I wash my hands of a' responsibility!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well. Mr. White!"</p>

  <p>The sublieutenant hauled himself in turn to windward. Curley Crothers gave
  the wheel a half-spoke and looked as if he had no interest in anything. Joe
  Byng in the chains bowed his head and groaned inwardly; his sticky, spray-
  washed lead seemed all-absorbing.</p>

  <p>"Tell that black robber to hurry aboard, unless he wants me to come in
  without him."</p>

  <p>The little boat had drifted fast before the wind, and the sublieutenant
  had to bellow through a megaphone to where the three men bailed and the
  ragged oarsmen swung their weight against the storm. The man of ebony, who
  would be pilot and disgrace the Navy, balanced on a thwart with wide-spread
  naked toes and yelled an ululating answer. With his rags out-blown in the
  monsoon he looked like a sea wraith come to life. The big gongs clanged
  again, and the Puncher drifted rather than drove down on the smaller craft. A
  hand line caught the pilot precisely in the face. He grabbed it frantically,
  fell headlong in the sea, and was hauled aboard.</p>

  <p>"He says he wants a tow for that boat of his," reported the sublieutenant.
  "Said it in English, too &mdash; seems he knows more than he pretends."</p>

  <p>"Missed it, by gad, by just about five minutes!" said the commander aloud
  but to himself. "Well &mdash; the bargain's made, so it can't be helped. That
  boat's sinking! Throw 'em a line, quick!"</p>

  <p>The pilot's crew displayed no overdone affection for their craft, and
  there was no struggle to the last to leave it. One by one &mdash; whichever
  could grab the line first was the first to come &mdash; they were hauled
  through the thundering waves and their boat was left to sink. Then, before
  they could adjust their unaccustomed feet to the different balance of the
  Puncher's heaving deck, the gongs clanged and the destroyer leaped ahead like
  a dripping sea-soused water beetle, into her utmost speed that instant.</p>

  <p>All conscious of his new-won dignity, and utterly regardless of his boat,
  the pilot had found the bridge at once. He clung to the rail there and braced
  one naked foot against a stanchion. To him the ship's speed seemed the all-
  absorbing thing, for either Mr. Hartley had forgotten just how many
  revolutions would make fifteen knots or else he had underestimated his
  engine-room's capacity. The Puncher split the waves and spewed them twenty
  feet above her, racing head-on for the reef, and Curley Crothers was too busy
  at his wheel to pass the pilot the surreptitious insult he intended.</p>

  <p>The gongs clanged presently, and the Puncher swallowed half her speed at
  once, giving the pilot courage.</p>

  <p>"This exceedingly damn dangerous place, sah!" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"No bottom at eight!" sang Joe Byng in the chains.</p>

  <p>Three words passed between the commander and Crothers, and the Puncher
  hove a weed-draped underside high over the crest of a beam-on roller as she
  veered a dozen points, ducked her starboard rail into the trough of it, and
  sliced her long thin nose, sizzling and swirling, into the welter ahead. It
  was growing weedier and dirtier each minute.</p>

  <p>"No bottom at eight!" chanted Joe Byng.</p>

  <p>And at the sound of his voice the pilot hauled himself up by his leverage
  on the rail and found his voice again.</p>

  <p>"This most exceedingly damn dangerous place, sah!"</p>

  <p>But the commander was too busy acting all three L's &mdash; Log, Lead and
  Lookout &mdash; his shrouded figure swaying to the heave and fall and his
  eyes fixed straight ahead of him on the double line of boiling foam. He had
  conned his course and had it charted in his head. There was no time to argue
  with a pilot.</p>

  <p>"Port you-ah hel-um, sah! Port you-ah hel-um!"</p>

  <p>"By the mark &mdash; seven!" sang Joe Byng from the chains.</p>

  <p>"Port you-ah hel-um, sah!" yelled the pilot in an ecstasy of fright.</p>

  <p>"Starboard a little," came the quiet command.</p>

  <p>Curley Crothers moved his wheel and the Puncher's bow yawed twenty feet,
  as if Providence had pushed her.</p>

  <p>"Gawd A'mighty!" murmured Joe Byng, gazing open-mouthed at fifty feet of
  jagged rock that grinned up suddenly three waves away.</p>

  <p>The pilot braced both feet against a stanchion and tried to take the weigh
  off her by pulling.</p>

  <p>"Half speed, sah! Go slow, sah! Go dead slow, sah! You'll pile up you-ah
  damn ship, sah! Ah tell you, sah, you'll pile her up as suah as hell, sah!
  'Bout a million sharks round he-ah, sah! For the love o' God, sah &mdash;
  Captain, sah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, muzzle him, some one!" ordered the commander, and the jiggling,
  complaining engines danced ahead, the horrid gray beneath the pilot's ebony
  notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>"By the deep &mdash; four!" warned Joe Byng in a level sing-song. The two
  gongs clanged like an echo to him, and the Puncher's speed was reduced at
  once to her point, of minimum stability. She rolled and quivered like a
  living thing in fear, falling on and off, nosing out a passage on her own
  account apparently, and seeming to be gathering all her strength for one
  tremendous effort.</p>

  <p>"That's bettah, sah! That's bettah, Captain, sah! Go astern! This he-ah's
  the bar, sah &mdash; damn bad place, the bar, sah! Go astern, sah. Captain,
  sah, d'you he-ah me &mdash; go astern! Try again, 'nother place further up,
  sah. Captain, sah! Over that way; that way thar &mdash; that way, sah!"</p>

  <p>He pointed through the sky-flung spray with a trembling finger and his
  voice was rich with doleful emphasis, but the commander held his course and
  carried on. There seemed neither sympathy nor understanding on that
  unsteadiest of ships. Curley Crothers, solemn-faced as Nemesis and looking
  half as compassionate, moved his wheel a trifle. Joe Byng in the chains kept
  up his even sing-song, expressionless, as if he were an automatic clock that
  did not care, but must record the truth each time his dripping pendulum
  touched bottom.</p>

  <p>"And a half &mdash; three!"</p>

  <p>White foam was boiling in among the dirty welter, and the Puncher's bow
  pitched suddenly as the first big bar wave lifted her; a second later her
  propellers chug-chug-chugged in surface spume as she kicked upward like a
  porpoise diving.</p>

  <p>"Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy!" groaned the pilot. "This he-ah watah's full of
  sharks, an' that's the bar! You're on the bar now, Captain, sah!"</p>

  <p>"By the mark &mdash; three!" Byng chanted steadily.</p>

  <p>"Starboard a little more," said the commander leaning forward and shoving
  the pilot away to leeward at the same time. Then he shouted to the fo'castle
  head, where a bosun's mate and his crew had climbed and were awaiting orders
  in evident and most unreasonable unconcern.</p>

  <p>"Get both anchors ready!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, sir!" came the answer, and efficiency controlled by experts
  proceeded at kaleidoscopic angles to defy the elements. The big steel hooks
  were ready in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Stop her!" ordered the commander.</p>

  <p>The gongs clanged out an alarm and the throbbing ceased.</p>

  <p>"Hard astern, both engines!"</p>

  <p>Again there was a clangor under hatches, and the suffering bearings
  shrieked. The Puncher dropped her stern two feet or so, and the foam boiled
  brown round her propellers. The shock of the reversal pitched the pilot up
  against the forward rail, where he clung like a drowning man.</p>

  <p>"For the love o' God, sah! Captain; sah, we've struck! Ah told you so; Ah
  said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And a half-three!" chanted Joe Byng.</p>

  <p>"Stop her! Starboard engine ahead! Port engine ahead! Ease your helm! Meet
  her! Half speed ahead!"</p>

  <p>The Puncher pitched and rolled, kicking at the following monsoon that
  thundered at her counter and tossing up the foam that seethed about her bow.
  She trembled from end to end, as if the pounding of the water hurt her.</p>

  <p>"Helm amidships!" ordered the commander suddenly.</p>

  <p>"'Midships, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Full speed ahead, both engines!"</p>

  <p>The Puncher leaped, as all destroyers do the second day they are loosed.
  She sliced through the storm straight for the coral beach beyond the bar,
  shaking her graceful shoulders free of the sticky spray &mdash; reeling,
  rolling, thugging, kicking, bucking through the welter to where quiet water
  waited and the ever-lasting, utterly unrighteous stink of sun-baked Arab
  beaches. As each tremendous breaker thundered on her stern each time she
  lifted to the underswell, the pilot vowed that she had struck, rolling his
  eyes and calling two different deities to witness that none of it was any
  fault of his.</p>

  <p>"Thar's no water, sah &mdash; no water, Captain, sah &mdash; not one drop!
  You've piled up you-ah ship! Ah told you so; Ah said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By the deep &mdash; four!"</p>

  <p>"And a half-four!"</p>

  <p>"By the mark &mdash; five!"</p>

  <p>The Puncher was across the bar, gliding through muddy water on an even
  keel and giving the lie direct to him whose fee was ten pounds English. The
  pilot drew a talisman of some kind from underneath the least torn portion of
  his shirt, and to the commander's amazement kissed it. It is not often that a
  woolly headed, or any other, native of the East kisses either folk or things.
  But the commander was too busy at the moment to ask questions.</p>

  <p>"Have your starboard anchor ready!" he commanded, making mental notes.</p>

  <p>"Ready, sir!"</p>

  <p>The glittering, wet, wind-blown beach and the little estuary slid by like
  a painted panorama smelling of all the evil in the world as the Puncher eased
  her helm a time or two seeking a comfortable berth with Joe Byng's chanted
  aid.</p>

  <p>"Let go twenty fathoms!"</p>

  <p>The pilot sighed relief as the starboard anchor splashed into the water
  and the cable roared after it through the hawse pipe.</p>

  <p>"What nationality are you?" asked the commander, watching the Puncher
  swing and gaging distances, but sparing one eye now for his unwelcome but
  official guest.</p>

  <p>"Me, sah?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you."</p>

  <p>The pilot looked anywhere but at his questioner, and a picture passed
  before the commander's eyes &mdash; a memory, perhaps, of something he had
  read about at school &mdash; of Christians in Nero's day being asked what
  their religion was.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid to tell me?" he asked, softening his voice to a kinder
  tone as he remembered that God did not make all men Englishmen, and turning
  just in time to cause Crothers to withdraw his right leg.</p>

  <p>The pilot's toes were, after all, not destined to be trodden on just
  then.</p>

  <p>"No, sah, Ah'm not afraid."</p>

  <p>"What are you, then?"</p>

  <p>"Ah'm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well? What?"</p>

  <p>"Ah'm English!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Captain, sah, Ah'm English!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! Are you? Um-m-m! Mr. White, give this man his ten pounds, will you?
  And get his receipt for it."</p>

  <p>That appeared to end matters, so far as the commander was concerned;
  official dignity forbade any further interest. But it was not so very long
  since Mr. White was senior midshipman, and it takes a man until he is admiral
  of the fleet to unlearn all he knew then and forget the curiosity of those
  days.</p>

  <p>"Now, I should have thought you were a Scotchman," he suggested without
  smiling, studying the salt-encrusted wrinkles on the ebony face. "You like
  whisky?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sah &mdash; positively, sah! Yes, Captain, sah &mdash; Ah do!"</p>

  <p>Mr. White sent for whisky and poured out a stiff four fingers, to the
  awful disgust of Curley Crothers, who saw the whole transaction. The pilot
  consumed it so instantly that there seemed never to have been any in the
  glass.</p>

  <p>"I suppose your name's Macnab &mdash; or Macphairson &mdash; which? Sign
  here, please."</p>

  <p>The pilot took the proffered pen in unaccustomed fingers and made a
  crisscross scrawl, adorned with thirteen blots. The pen nib broke under the
  strain, and he handed it back with an air of confidential remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"That thing's no mo-ah good," he volunteered.</p>

  <p>"So I see. Now tell me your name in full, so that I can write it next to
  the mark. It's a wonder of a mark! Mac &mdash; what's the rest of it?"</p>

  <p>"Hassan Ah."</p>

  <p>"Machassan?"</p>

  <p>"No, sah. Hassan Ah."</p>

  <p>"And you're English?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sah."</p>

  <p>"With that name?"</p>

  <p>"Mah name makes no diffunts, sah. Ah'm English."</p>

  <p>"Well &mdash; here's your money. Cutter away, there! Put the pilot and his
  crew ashore! Sorry about your boat, pilot, but it couldn't be helped."</p>

  <p>"Makes me believe that I'm a nigger!" muttered Curley Crothers, not yet
  released from duty on the bridge.</p>

  <p>"First time I ever wished I was a Dutchman!" swore Joe Byng, coiling up
  his sounding line.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the cutter's captain swung the boat's stern in shore
  when he judged that he was reasonably near enough and too far in for sharks.
  He had his orders to put the pilot and his crew ashore, but the means had not
  been too exactly specified.</p>

  <p>"Get out and swim for it, you bally Englishman!" he ordered, using a boat-
  hook on the nearest one to make his meaning clear.</p>

  <p>One by one they jumped for it, the pilot going last. He plainly did not
  understand the point of view.</p>

  <p>"Ah'm English!" he expostulated. "Lissen he-ah, Ah'm English! Damwell
  English!"</p>

  <p>"All right; let's see you swim, English!" jeered the cutter's captain, and
  the pilot took the water with a splash.</p>

  <p>"Ah su-ah am English!" he vowed, as he swam for the shore, and he stood by
  the sea's edge repeating his assertion with a leathery pair of lungs until
  the cutter had rowed out of ear-shot.</p>

  <p>"English, is he?" said Joe Byng to Curley Crothers in the fo'castle, not
  twenty minutes later. "I'd show him, if I had him in here for twenty
  minutes!"</p>

  <p>"That fellow's interested me," said Crothers. "He's got me thinking. I
  vote we investigate him."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Ashore, fathead."</p>

  <p>"There'll be no shore leave."</p>

  <p>"No? You left off being wet nurse to the dawg?" "I brush him, mornin's; if
  that's what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Is he fit?"</p>

  <p>"Fit to fight a bumboat full o' pilots!"</p>

  <p>"Could he be sick for an hour?"</p>

  <p>"Might be did."</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Morning?"</p>

  <p>"At about two bells?"</p>

  <p>"It could be done."</p>

  <p>"Then do it!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because, Joe Byng my boy, you and I want shore leave; and the pup &mdash;
  and he's a decent pup &mdash; must suffer for to make a 'tween-deck holiday.
  Get my meaning? I've a propagandrum that'll work this tide. You go and set
  the fuse in the pup's inside; and mind you, time it right, my son &mdash; for
  two bells when the old man's in the chair!"</p>

  <p>So Joe Byng, who was something of an expert in the way and ways of dogs,
  departed in search of an oiler with whom he was on terms of condescension;
  and he returned to the fo'castle a little later with the nastiest, most
  awful-smelling mess that ever emanated even from the engine-room of a
  destroyer in the Persian Gulf (where grease and things run rancid.)</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chapC2"
     id="chapC2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

  <p>Lying lazily at anchor off the reeking beach of Adra Bight, the Puncher
  looked peaceful and complacent &mdash; which is altogether opposite to what
  she and her commander were, or had been, for a month. The ship hummed her
  shut-in discontent, as a hive does when the bees propose to swarm, and her
  commander &mdash; who never, be it noted, went to windward of the one word
  "damn" &mdash; used that one word very frequently.</p>

  <p>He sat "abaft the mainmast" at a table that was splotched already with
  abundant perspiration, and the acting engineer who stood in front of him
  shifted from foot to foot in attitudes expressive of increasing agony of
  mind. It grew obvious at last that there was a limit to Mr. Hartley's store
  of courteous deference.</p>

  <p>There had been news, red hot but wrong, of dhows loaded to the water-line
  with guns and ammunition somewhere up the Gulf. India, ever fretful for her
  tribes beyond the border, had borrowed Applewaite and his destroyer by
  instant cablegram, and jealously held records had been broken while the
  Puncher quartered those indecent seas and heated up her bearings. It was
  almost too much to have to come back empty-handed. It was quite too much to
  have to run for shelter under the lee of Adra's uninviting coral reef. And to
  be told by an acting engineer that he would have to stay a week was utterly
  beyond the scope of polite conversation.</p>

  <p>"Why a week?" asked Commander Applewaite, with eyebrows raised to the nth
  power of incredulity.</p>

  <p>"Why a week?" asked Mr. Hartley, breaking down the barrier of self-
  restraint at last. "I'll tell you why. Because, although the guts of her are
  so much scrap-iron, you've a crew of engineers who could build machinery of
  hell-slag &mdash; build it, mind &mdash; and could get steam out o' the
  Sahara, where there isn't any water at all.</p>

  <p>"Because &mdash; conditional upon the act o' God and your permission
  &mdash; I'm willing to perform a miracle. Because the whole engine-room
  complement is dancing mad for shore leave, and there'll be none this side o'
  Bombay; and because, in consequence o' that, creation would be a mild name
  for what's about to happen under gratings until the shafts revolve again.
  Man, I wish ye'd take one peep at her bearings, though ye wouldn't
  understand.</p>

  <p>"Because you're lucky; any other engineer in all the navies o' the world
  would take a month to tinker with her, even if he didn't have to send to
  Bombay for a tow. Because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That'll do!" said Applewaite, his mind wandering already in search of
  suitable employment for the crew. "Get the repairs done as soon as possible;
  we stay here until you have finished what is necessary."</p>

  <p>It looked like an evil moment for asking favors, but it was the time laid
  down in Regulations when such things as favors may be had; and it was the
  moment Curley Crothers had picked out for asking for shore leave.</p>

  <p>"Come 'ere, Scamp. Come along, Scamp. Come along 'ere &mdash; good boy!"
  he coaxed, dragging by a short chain in his wake the sorriest-looking bull
  terrier that ever acted mascot in the British or any other navy. Courteous
  and huge and cap in hand, his weather-beaten face smiling respectfully above
  a snow-white uniform, he took his stand before the little table. His outward
  bearing was one of certainty, but his shrewd, slightly puckered eyes
  alternately conned the expression of his commander's face and watched the
  dog.</p>

  <p>The lee, scuppers were the goal of the dog's immediate ambition, for he
  was a well-brought-up dog and such of the decencies as were not his by
  instinct he had learned by painful and repeated acquisition. But at the
  moment Curley Crothers showed a wondrous disregard for etiquette.</p>

  <p>"He's very sick, sir," he asserted, tugging a little at the chain in the
  hope of producing instant proof of his contention. But the dog was gamiest of
  the game, and swallowed hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Well? I'm not a vet. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"The whole ship's crew 'ud be sorry, sir, if 'e was to lose 'is number.
  He's the best mascot this ship ever had, by all accounts."</p>

  <p>"He hasn't brought us much luck this run!" smiled Applewaite, remembering
  a long list of "previous convictions" and wondering what Crothers might be up
  to next.</p>

  <p>"No, sir? We're still a-top o' the water, sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh! He gets the credit for that, eh? But for him, I suppose we'd have
  piled up on the reef yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Saving your presence, sir."</p>

  <p>Curley Crothers made a gesture expressive of a world of compliment and
  praise, but he kept one eye steadily on the dog; he seemed to imply that but
  for the presence of the dog on board the commander might have forgotten his
  seamanship.</p>

  <p>"Well? What do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"Seeing the poor dog's sick, sir, and you and all of us so fond of him,
  and all he needs is exercise, I thought perhaps as 'ow you'd order me an'
  Byng, sir, to take 'im for a run ashore. There'd be jackals and pi-dogs for
  'im to chase. A bit o' sport 'ud set 'im up in a jiffy. He's languishing
  &mdash; that's what's the matter with him."</p>

  <p>There were almost tears in his voice as he tugged at the chain
  surreptitiously, in a vain effort to produce the cataclysm that was overdue.
  But for all his efforts to appear affected, his eyes were smiling. So were
  his commander's.</p>

  <p>"Why Byng?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Byng cleans him, sir. He knows Byng."</p>

  <p>"Then, why you?"</p>

  <p>"Why; he knows me too, sir, and between the two of us, we'd manage him
  proper. S'posin' he was to get huntin' on his own and one of us was tired out
  chasin' him, t'other could run and catch him. If there was only one of us, he
  couldn't."</p>

  <p>"I see. Well? One of the other men might take him on the chain. A good-
  conduct man, for instance."</p>

  <p>Crothers tugged at the chain, and the unhappy dog drew away toward the
  scuppers with all his remaining strength.</p>

  <p>"He's cussed about the chain, sir &mdash; apt to drag on it and try to
  chaw it through. Besides, sir, when a dawg's sick, he's like a man &mdash;
  same as me an' you; he likes to 'ave 'is partic'lar pals with 'im. Now, that
  dawg's fond o' me an' Byng.'</p>

  <p>"I see. But supposing exercise isn't what he wants after all? Suppose he
  needs a long rest and lots of sleep? How about that?"</p>

  <p>The argument had reached a crisis, and Curley realized it. Joking or not,
  when the commander of a ship takes too long in reaching a decision he
  generally does not reach a favorable one. The leash was tugged again, this
  time with some severity. The martyred Scamp was drawn on his protesting
  haunches close to the official table, that the commander might have a better
  view of his distress. And then the expected happened &mdash;
  voluminously.</p>

  <p>Curley stood with an expression of wooden-headed, abject innocence on his
  big, broad face, and looked straight in front of him.</p>

  <p>"He certainly is sick, sir," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Sick. Good heavens! The dog's turning himself inside out! That's the last
  time a thing like this happens; he's the last dog I ever take on a cruise.
  Take him away at once! Bosun &mdash; call some one to wipe up that disgusting
  mess!"</p>

  <p>"Take him ashore, did you say, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Take him out of this! Take him anywhere you like! Yes, take him ashore
  and lose him &mdash; feed him to the sharks &mdash; give him to the Arabs
  &mdash; take him away, that's all!"</p>

  <p>"Me and Byng, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you and Byng! Did you hear me tell you to take him away?"</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir; thank you!"</p>

  <p>Curley Crothers saluted without the vestige of a smile, and hurried off
  before the dog could show too early signs of recovering health and strength
  or the commander could change his mind.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Scamp," he whispered. "That was nothing but a temporary
  disaccommodation to your tummy, doglums; we'll soon have you to rights
  again."</p>

  <p>He dived into the fo'castle with the dog behind him, and there were those
  who noticed that the terrier's whip-like tail no longer hugged his stomach,
  but was waving to the world at large.</p>

  <p>And thirty minutes later, as the Puncher's launch put off with Curley and
  Joe Byng comfortably seated in the stern, it was obvious to any one who cared
  to look that Scamp was the happiest and healthiest terrier in Asia.</p>

  <p>"Now, I wonder what they did to him," mused the Puncher's commander,
  watching from beneath his awning. "Those two men live up to the name they
  brought aboard! I believe they'd find means and a good excuse for walking to
  windward of a First Sea Lord!"</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chapC3"
     id="chapC3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

  <p>Now an Arab would as soon allow a dog to lick his face as he would think
  of eating pork in public with his women folk; so the bearded, hook-nosed
  believers in the Prophet who looked down from the rock wall that lines one
  side of Adra knew what to think of Curley and his friend Joe Byng long before
  either of them realized that they were being watched.</p>

  <p>Arrayed from head to ankles in spotless white, their black boots looking
  blacker by comparison, they proceeded in the general direction of the distant
  village, with the order and decorum of sea lords descending on a dockyard for
  inspection purposes. The trackless sand proved hot and sharp; the dog proved
  in poor condition from the voyage and the morning's incidental martyrdom, and
  Byng was generous-hearted. He picked up the dog and carried him; and Scamp
  displayed his gratitude in customary canine way.</p>

  <p>The comments of the watching Arabs would not fit into any story in the
  world, and it is quite as well that Crothers and Joe Byng did not hear them
  and could not have translated them, for in the other case trouble would have
  started even sooner than it did. As it was, they tumbled and maneuvered over
  unresisting sand through almost tangible stench to where a gap in the ragged
  wall did duty as a gate. As they came nearer, a banner with the star and
  crescent was displayed from the wall-top, but no other sign was given that
  their coming was observed.</p>

  <p>It was not until they had debouched (as Crothers termed it) to their half-
  right front and had taken to a narrow one-man track that ran below the wall
  that any over attention was paid them. Suddenly a hook-nosed Asiatic
  gentleman emerged through the once-was gateway &mdash; a picture of a Bible
  shepherd but for the long-barreled gun he carried instead of crook &mdash; a
  brown shadow against brown masonry. He challenged them in Arabic, and Curley
  Crothers answered him in Queen Victoria's English that all was well.</p>

  <p>"Everything in the garden's lovely!" he asserted, in a deep-sea sing-
  song. "How's yourself?"</p>

  <p>The man repeated whatever he had said before, this time with a gesture of
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"Friend!" roared Byng and Curley both together. And the bull terrier took
  the joint yell for a war cry, or a bunting call, or possibly the herald's
  overture that summons bull pups to Valhalla. He was bred right and British
  Navy trained and his was not to reason why. He waited for no second
  invitation, but lit out from Byng's arms like a streak &mdash; a whip-tail,
  snow-white streak &mdash; for where the Arab's hard lean legs shone shiny-
  brown below his fluttering brown raiment.</p>

  <p>"Come back, there!" yelled both keepers in excited unison, but they called
  too late.</p>

  <p>Each grabbed for the chain too late. Their heads and shoulders cannoned
  and they fell together on the hot, dirty sand while Scamp and the Arab made
  each other's intimate acquaintance in a whirl of ripping cloth and legs and
  teeth and blasphemy.</p>

  <p>That in itself was bad enough, and good enough excuse if such were wanted
  for war between the Shadow of God Upon Earth and England's distant Queen; but
  there was worse to follow.</p>

  <p>One does not laugh, between certain parallels, unless the ultimate degree
  of insult is intended. And Curley Crothers and Joe Byng did laugh. They held
  their ribs and laughed until their muscles ached and their strong men's
  strength oozed out of them.</p>

  <p>They were laughing when they grabbed the dog at last and pulled him off.
  They laughed as they set the Arab on his feet and gave him back his gun; and
  they laughed at him with Christian and mannerly good grace when he spat at
  them in awful frenzy until the spittle matted in his beard. And, being
  gentlemen after a fashion quite their own, they smilingly apologized.</p>

  <p>Arabia lies in the middle of the zone where laughter is not wisdom. And a
  smile lies midway in the measure of a laugh. A laugh might be unintentional.
  A smile must be deliberate. And the Arab's spittle was run dry. Creed,
  custom, law of tooth for tooth and the thought of half a hundred
  co-religionists all watching him from crannies in the wall combined to make
  him shoot, since further means of showing malice were denied him; and he
  raised the long butt to his shoulder with meaning that was unmistakable.</p>

  <p>And so, with sorrow that the East should be so lacking in good fellowship,
  but with the ready instinct of men who have been trained for war, they closed
  with him from two directions, swiftly, bull-dog-wise, and took his gun away.
  And how could even an able seaman help the dog's taking a share in the game
  again?</p>

  <p>So far, nobody had done anything intended to be wrong &mdash; least of all
  the dog. The Arab was defending institutions; Crothers and Joe Byng were bent
  on holiday, and full of kind regards for anything that lived; and the dog was
  living dogfully up to well-bred-terrier tradition. It was as if two harmless
  chemicals had met and blended into nitroglycerin.</p>

  <p>Deprived of his gun, the Arab drew a knife; and no British sailor lives
  who does not understand the quick-loosed answer to the glint of steel. Fist
  and boot both landed on the Arab quicker than his own thought served the
  knife, and the weight of quick concussions jarred him into all but coma. This
  time Byng caught the dog in time and held him back, leaving Curley Crothers
  to finish matters by making the long knife prize of war. Once more he helped
  the Arab on his feet, smiling hugely and gentling the iron sinews with huge
  paws that could have wrenched them all apart if need be.</p>

  <p>"Take my advice, cully, and weigh quick!" he counseled, looking the Arab
  over and making sure the unfortunate had not been too much hurt. "Run for
  shelter where you can cool your bearings! Run off to the mosque and pray, to
  make up for all that cussing. Go and be good! And next time you meets us, be
  friendly &mdash; see?"</p>

  <p>The Arab was too apoplectically angry to comply, but Crothers took him by
  both shoulders and shoved him; and finding himself shot forward out of reach,
  seeing safety ahead and its possible corollary of awful vengeance, he
  suddenly achieved discretion and scampered through the gap in the wall.</p>

  <p>"'E's gone to fetch his pals. Look out, mate!" warned Joe Byng.</p>

  <p>"Not 'im!" vowed Crothers. "'E's 'ad enough, that's all! We've seen the
  last of 'im!"</p>

  <p>And the most amazing thing of all was that Crothers believed just what he
  said &mdash; Curley Crothers, to whom Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports were as
  an open book, and to whom the Arab customs and religion and reprehensible
  tendencies were currently supposed to be first-reader knowledge. It was he
  who had proved there were no harems &mdash; he who coined the Navy adage,
  "Search an Arab first, and sit on him, before you come to terms!"</p>

  <p>Yet here he was, advising Byng to disregard a looted Arab's spittle! There
  is no accounting, ever, for the ways of shore-leave sailor-men.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Joe," he said. "Lead 'the dawg &mdash; he can walk now &mdash;
  and let's see what Adra looks like."</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chapC4"
     id="chapC4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

  <p>All might have been well, and both seamen might have reached the Puncher
  again with dignity and grace, had they not entered Adra, past the only jail
  in that part of Arabia. And an Arab jail being rarer and one percent more
  evil than any other evil thing there is, the two of them quite naturally
  paused to make its closest possible acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Look out for vermin!" cautioned Curley, standing on tiptoe to peer in
  through the close-spaced iron bars.</p>

  <p>They forgot the dog. The jail, for the moment, challenged all their waking
  senses, the olfactory by no means least.</p>

  <p>"Can you see anything?" asked Byng.</p>

  <p>Before Crothers could answer him, a snarl, then a yap, then a quick,
  determined growl gave warning of the terrier's interest in something else
  than fleas.</p>

  <p>He had been scratching himself peacefully a moment earlier; now, like a
  bower anchor taking charge, he ripped the chain through Byng's hand and was
  off &mdash; chin, back and tail in one straight, striving line &mdash; in
  full chase of a pariah.</p>

  <p>The yellow cur yapped its agony of fear; the nearest hundred and odd mangy
  monsters of the gutter took up the chorus; within five seconds of the start
  there was the Puncher's mascot racing after one abominable scavenger, and
  after him in just as hot pursuit there raced the whole street-cleaning force
  of Adra &mdash; tongues out, eyes blazing, and their mean thin barks all
  working overtime.</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Scamp!" groaned Byng, estimating rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Not yet it ain't!" said Crothers, grabbing Byng's arm and nearly tearing
  out the muscles.</p>

  <p>It was a crude way of rousing Byng's latent speed, both of thought and
  movement, but it worked. Before Joe could swear, even, Crothers was off like
  the wind, with Joe after him, using the string of oaths he had meant for
  Crothers on the sand that gave under him and made him stumble at every other
  stride.</p>

  <p>Adra turned out, as a colony of prairie dogs might from planless burrows;
  only these had more venom in their bite than prairie dogs and came from
  structural instead of natural, from flea-bepeppered instead of grass-grown
  dirt. Man, woman and child &mdash; the grown men armed, the women veiled in
  dirt-brown, some of them, and some (mostly the better-looking) unveiled and
  unashamed, the little children mostly naked and colored with all the human
  hues there are &mdash; raced, yelling, through a swarm of flies in hot
  pursuit. Never since Shem's great-grandson gat the Arab race was there a
  procession like it.</p>

  <p>Behind its mud-and-Masonry decrepit wall that guards only the seaward
  side, Adra straggles quite a distance desertward; and there are winding
  streets enough to hide an army in, provided that the army did not mind the
  fleas. Scamp, view-halloaing his utmost, led that most amazing hunt a quite
  considerable circuit before other men and dogs, arriving from a dozen
  different directions, set a limit to his unobstructed movement.</p>

  <p>He knew what he was after, but they did not; they had come to see. For a
  moment they seemed to think that Scamp was the object of the chase, and a
  dozen guns of a dozen different kinds and dates were aimed at him.</p>

  <p>And then, as consciousness dawns on a man recovering from choloform, there
  swept over their lethargic Eastern brains the simultaneous idea that Curley
  Crothers and Joe Byng were the real quarry; and &mdash; again like men
  recovering from chloroform &mdash; they did not quite know what to do. Should
  they slay, there was the Puncher to be reckoned with; and the Puncher's port
  quick-firers could be seen commanding Adra by any man who cared to climb the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Besides, an Arab's hospitality is proverbial. He very seldom kills a
  visitor on sight.</p>

  <p>On the other hand a man, and particularly a British sailor, who runs has
  reason, as a rule. Therefore these two men were evidently guilty. Therefore
  they must not escape. In five seconds the affair had changed from a
  spectacular amusement, with Adra's population in the role of super-heated
  audience, to a hunt of Crothers and Joe Byng.</p>

  <p>Within ten seconds each of the sailors lay with his face pressed hard into
  the sand and at least a dozen Arabs sitting on him. Scamp &mdash; utterly
  forgotten now by all except the sailors &mdash; still behind the one stray
  pariah and ahead of all the rest but beginning to appreciate the fact that he
  was hunted, and beginning to feel spent &mdash; raced on, took three sharp
  turns in close succession, and was gathered all unwilling in the arms of an
  enormous black man who snatched him from the very teeth of the following pack
  and dispersed them, howling, by means of well-directed kicks.</p>

  <p>"Ah seed you yesterday, Ah did," said his deliverer in English; and,
  recalling principle, the terrier bit at him &mdash; only to find himself
  muzzled by a horny, huge fist that caressed even while it rendered
  impotent.</p>

  <p>"Ah'm fond of little dogs! Ah'm English!"</p>

  <p>Scamp understood nothing of the conversation, but with canine instinct
  realized that he was safe; and after that he was satisfied to lie and pant.
  With five red inches of tongue hanging out, and no sign whatever of his
  white-uniformed guardians to trouble him, a black man's arms were as good as
  any other place; he did not waste half a thought on Byng and Crothers.</p>

  <p>But Byng, three turnings back, spat filthy sand out of his mouth the
  moment an Arab deemed it safe to leave off sitting on his head, looked wildly
  around for Crothers, and bellowed &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Where's the pup?"</p>

  <p>Crothers, spitting out sand, too, twenty yards behind where the swifter
  Byng had fallen, called back:</p>

  <p>"Dunno. Whistle him!"</p>

  <p>Byng tried to whistle, and the Arabs mistook the effort for a signal. In
  an instant both men were face-downward again, struggling for breath and
  clawing at the dirt. Then worse befell. The gentleman whose brown anatomy had
  suffered from the seamen's feet and fists just previous to their invasion of
  the town limped up with his eye teeth showing and his flapping cotton raiment
  still unmended where the dog had torn it. Any other wrath, however awful,
  could be nothing but the shadow of his state of mind; and since he knew the
  more vindictive portions of the Koran all by heart, and was quoting as he
  came, there was little need of words to illustrate further his attitude.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be a person of authority. An Arab town or village is a
  democracy in which each free man has his say; not even a sheik can overrule
  the vote of a majority, and this man was no sheik. But rage and
  self-assertion will generally exercise a certain weight in tribal councils,
  and the crowd in this case was too doubtful of the facts to have any settled
  notions of its own.</p>

  <p>"To the jail with them!" the new arrival almost shrieked, and about a
  dozen in the crowd took up the cry &mdash;</p>

  <p>"To jail with them!"</p>

  <p>"Infidels! Worshipers of dogs! Wine-drinkers! Eaters of pig flesh! Dogs
  and the sons of dogs &mdash; what mothers gave them birth? Are your hands,
  True-believers, fit bonds for them? To the jail! To the jail that Abdul
  Hamid caused his men to build for such as these!"</p>

  <p>He stooped and looked deliberately to make sure that Crothers could not
  break away, then came closer and spat on him, saving half his spittle with
  impartial forethought for the struggling Byng, who looked up in time to see
  what was in store for him. Being spat on is even less exhilarating than it
  sounds or looks, and Byng waxed speechless after passing through a
  many-worded stage of blasphemy.</p>

  <p>Crothers, the larger of the two and by six brawny inches more phlegmatic,
  bode his time in silence, so that neither of them spoke a word while they
  were hustled and cuffed along the street between the unbaked brick hovels. It
  was not until the reinforced iron door of Adra's one stone building slammed
  on them that either of them said a word.</p>

  <p>Then &mdash;</p>

  <p>"I'm not a mean man," protested Crothers.</p>

  <p>"No?" said Byng, monosyllabic for a start.</p>

  <p>"No," repeated Crothers, "I am not, Joe Byng. But &mdash; and I says it
  solemn; I says it with one 'and above my 'ed, and I'd take my affidavy on it
  in a court o' law, if it's the last word I ever does say an' it's my dying
  oath &mdash; so 'elp me Solomon and all 'is glory; I'm a Dutchman if I
  wouldn't like to 'ave a come-back at that Arab."</p>

  <p>Byng lay full length on his stomach, and buried his face in his arms. He
  was still too full of wrath for words.</p>

  <p>"I'd kick his mother, if I couldn't land on him," mused Crothers. And then
  he busied himself about conning his new bearings. It was a four-walled jail
  &mdash; one-doored, one-windowed, iron-barred &mdash; ill-smelling,
  verminous, too hot for words and too suggestive of the opposite of home,
  sweet home to call forth humor, even from a seaman.</p>

  <p>"They'll come an' rescue us," moaned Byng. "They'll quarantine the pair of
  us for being lousy, and they'll turn the perishing salt-water hose on us.
  We're due for the brig for Gawd knows 'ow long; our reppitation's gone; we've
  been spat on by a &mdash; by a Arab, and we 'aven't hit 'im back; an' we've
  lost the pup. We've gone an' lost the pup! Gawd! There ain't no more good in
  nothin'!"</p>

  <p>Which shows no more than that Joe Byng in his sorrow overlooked a
  circumstance or two. For instance, there were rings in the floor that
  Crothers eyed with keen curiosity. They were anchored in the solid blocks of
  stone.</p>

  <p>"It's better than it might be, mate!" he argued optimistically. "They
  might 'ave gone and chained us up to those!"</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chapC5"
     id="chapC5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p>Arabia has some peculiarities, not all of them discreditable, which she
  does not share with any other country. There is, for instance, the kind
  custom that dictates the setting free of slaves when they have rendered seven
  years' good service.</p>

  <p>That rule (and it is rather rule than law) tends to eliminate all class
  and color prejudice. Provided that a man will bow to Mecca three times daily
  and refrain from pork and wine, he may wear whatever skin God gave him and
  yet mingle with the best. He may even marry whom he will and can afford; and
  he may be whatever his ability, ambition, and audacity dictate.</p>

  <p>And Hassan Ah had never been a slave, so he had even less to overcome than
  might have been the case. He stalked Adra socially uncondemned where once he
  had caught fish, groomed camels, and done other irritating jobs. His old
  fish-catching days had given him an intimate acquaintance with the reef, and
  his small-boat seamanship, born of hard pulling in the trough of
  beam-on-seas, was well suited to the local type of craft.</p>

  <p>So nobody questioned his right to the title of harbor pilot. And if
  certain perquisites went with an otherwise barren office, that was to be
  expected. Who worked for nothing, or for the empty honor of it, in
  Arabia?</p>

  <p>Nobody can pass the reef at night in shallow-draft lateen-sail boats
  without having him on board; and though he was never ostensibly paid for his
  services, it was understood that he performed pilot service in return for
  certain other opportunities that sometimes came his way. When things happened
  on the high sea that were not discussed in public, it was understood that
  Hassan Ah could have discussed them as thoroughly as anybody if he chose.</p>

  <p>On the whole, then, and within limits that were only more or less
  definable, he was something of a personality. Men listened to him when he
  raised his voice in argument, and as one who could grant favors on occasion
  his words had weight.</p>

  <p>The sun was very nearly in its zenith, beating down on dry Arabia between
  racing black clouds, when he had finished talking to the local council in the
  ramshackle old council-house, skin and mat curtained, that faced the sheik's
  where the main street broadened for a hundred filthy yards into a
  market-place. All through his argument he had held a pure-white bull terrier
  between his knees as proof that he knew whereof he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Can any of you hold him without being bitten?" he demanded. And they did
  not seem to care to try.</p>

  <p>"I know the ways of these men!" be asserted, drawing extravagant
  expressions of contentment from the dog in proof of it.</p>

  <p>So the others in the stuffy council place gave the dog a wide berth and no
  privilege, but conceded him the right to hold the beast, if he wanted to,
  without personal defilement. And since the way of the world is that a man who
  has won the first of his contentions can win all the rest with half the ease,
  he persuaded them with a hurricane of black man's rhetoric to do what Arabs
  consider almost wicked.</p>

  <p>Unbelievers who are prisoners should die, beyond all question.</p>

  <p>"As the dregs of oil shall the fruit of the tree of Al Zakkum boil in the
  bellies of the damned!" the sheik quoted. "They should be hurried, therefore,
  to the punishment that waits!"</p>

  <p>But Hassen Ah outargued him.</p>

  <p>"Then they will land men from the ship, who will search our houses," he
  asserted. "Is there a majority in the council who would like to be searched
  by unbelievers?"</p>

  <p>"Then bind them, and take them to their ship, and tell a tale of much
  drunkenness and wrong-doing. Ask an indemnity, and show the proofs, which
  will be easy to arrange."</p>

  <p>"They, too, will tell their tale!" said Hassan Ah in perfect Arabic.</p>

  <p>Unlike the more enlightened peoples of the West, Arabs do not encourage
  the mutilation of their mother-tongue; they teach it as carefully as they
  talk it, and this negro spoke like an Arab of the blood.</p>

  <p>"There are certain damages they have received &mdash; some bruises on the
  face and tears in the clothing that does not belong to them but their
  government," he continued. "They would lay all the blame on us, and would
  breathe in the face of an appointed man, in proof that they were not drunk.
  And who could get other drink than coffee or water here? And who would
  believe the rest of our story, having found that part to be a lie? There
  would be a landing, and a search for proof, and much unpleasantness.
  Besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>If he had intended to add further arguments, the sheik saw fit to nip them
  in the bud; for there were some men in the council-room who did not know as
  much as Hassan Ah. Any free man may speak in council in Arabia.</p>

  <p>"What is thy way, then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The woolly headed pilot laughed aloud, taking care to make it evident that
  he was laughing at the prisoners; to laugh at a sheik or a sheik's
  bewilderment would be too dangerous.</p>

  <p>"I would send them to the ship well satisfied," he answered.</p>

  <p>"With money?" asked the sheik.</p>

  <p>"With whose money?" asked Hassan Ah.</p>

  <p>"With thine?" shot back the sheik.</p>

  <p>"In the name of Allah, no!"</p>

  <p>The black man laughed again, and rose to lean against the wall behind him,
  gathering the dog up in his arms.</p>

  <p>"If it is the order of the council," he asserted, "I will send them back
  satisfied, with a tale to tell that will bring about no landing. Also, I will
  give the council much amusement."</p>

  <p>"But will other sailors land afterward, seeking similar amusement?" asked
  the sheik.</p>

  <p>"No! There will be an order that none land!"</p>

  <p>The sheik took a vote on it. Heads nodded solemnly all around the room as
  his eyes sought each half-veiled face in turn. His own face was almost
  altogether shielded by the brown linen head-dress, for men of his race like
  to reach a judgment unobserved. They were all nods that answered him, and he
  saw fit to keep his own opinion to himself.</p>

  <p>"Thou seest? These others are all with thee. Have it thine own way, Hassan
  Ah. Unlock thou the riddle and on thy head be the answer! Thou hast our leave
  to go."</p>

  <p>So Hassan Ah set out undaunted for the jail, with a terrier in tow behind
  him and a huge smile on his broad-beamed face. And behind him a murmur rose
  that:</p>

  <p>"It was well. He brought the warship in, instead of leaving it outside or
  &mdash; as any wise man would have done &mdash; wrecking it on the outer
  reef, where it could have been plundered at discretion. Let him send the
  sailors back again and bear the consequences!"</p>

  <p>And within a minute of the pilot's arrival at the window of the jail
  (through which he peered for two minutes before speaking) the whole of Adra's
  council, followed by the city's children in a noisy horde, proceeded in a
  cluster after him and took up position, each as he saw fit, at different
  vantage points.</p>

  <p>Then Hassan Ah shook a loose bar of the window until it rattled, and so
  called attention to himself. Crothers and Joe Byng raced for the window neck
  and neck, and reached it simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"You two men want you-ah dog?" asked Hassan Ah, and the chained dog leaped
  up at the window as both men swore at once.</p>

  <p>"You pass him in here! Come on, you black-faced cornerman! There'll be a
  cutter's crew ashore pretty soon to rescue us, and if you don't hand that dog
  over before they get here you'll get the worst whipping you ever had in all
  your black life!"</p>

  <p>"They'll feed you to the dog when they're through with you!" vowed
  Byng.</p>

  <p>"Come on, MacHassan!" ordered Crothers. "Get the key and pass the dog in.
  That'll settle your account. T hen you's free. You needn't be 'fraid."</p>

  <p>"Ah'm English," said the pilot of the day before, with an enormous grin
  that showed a pound or two of yellow ivory. "Ah'm not afraid; Ah can lick
  you; Ah can fight same as you men. Ah'm English!"</p>

  <p>"Fight? You Irish Chink! Which of us two do you want to fight?" asked the
  outraged Byng. "Come on in here! I'll fight you!"</p>

  <p>But to Byng's amazement Hassan Ah pointed to Crothers, who was heavier by
  forty pounds or more and taller by at least half a head.</p>

  <p>"Ah choose him!" he grinned; and Curley Crothers clenched both fists in
  absolute but quite unterrified amazement.</p>

  <p>"Come on, then," he answered. "Open the door." Then, as an afterthought
  &mdash; "I'll fight you for the dog."</p>

  <p>"Ah don't want to kill that little man," said Hassan Ah. "But Ah'll give
  you the dog, win or lose, if you'll fight me. You fight fair? You fight
  English?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" said Crothers. "I fight Queensberry rules. That suit
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh-ah, yes! Keensby rules, that's it. All right-o!"</p>

  <p>Hassan Ah produced his key and turned it in the creaking lock. He was
  stripping himself even before the two sailors were out in the sun, and by the
  time that Crothers and Joe Byng had realized that there was an audience of
  something like a thousand, including children, he was standing posed like a
  gladiator, with the straight-down tropic sun streaming off his ebony hide. As
  Crothers, not quite sure even yet that the whole affair was not a joke, began
  to doff his blouse it dawned on him that if the thing were true it would not
  be a picnic.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah shohly do. Are you afraid o' me?"</p>

  <p>That, of course, settled matters. The thing was not a joke, and Englishman
  or nigger &mdash; black, green, white, or gray &mdash; the plot must be
  licked forthwith and in accordance with the rules.</p>

  <p>Crothers spat into his hands, while Joe Byng folded up his blouse and
  knelt on it. He eyed his antagonist for at least a minute, summing him up and
  ignoring none of the woolly-headed one's physical advantages in weight and
  strength, in height and reach, in being used to the climate and the glare,
  the odds were all with Hassan Ah. Then he sized up the moral odds; and though
  a biased audience might be at first supposed to weigh against him too, the
  sight of all those Arabs waiting to see him beaten roused his fighting
  dander.</p>

  <p>"Do you represent the bloke that spat on us two men?" asked Crothers.</p>

  <p>"Ah represent maself! Ah'm English! Ah fight English, and Ah'll prove
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, wade into him!" advised Joe Byng. "London Prize Rules &mdash; no time
  called until a man's down. Go on, Curley &mdash; lead!"</p>

  <p>"Do you agree?" asked Crothers.</p>

  <p>"Suttainly!" The black man seemed disposed to agree to anything so long as
  he could get what he was after.</p>

  <p>"Then here goes!" said Crothers; and he stepped in and led for the honor
  of the British Navy.</p>

  <p>Oh! It was a fight! Crothers knew what he was up against the instant that
  his left fist slid along an ebony forearm and his nose collided with what
  seemed like an iron club. Steamship pilot this man might not be, but fighting
  man he very surely was. He hit straight and guarded high. He was no untutored
  savage. He had the hardest to acquire of all the Christian arts at his
  fingers' (or rather his fists') ends, and the heavyweight champion of Gosport
  took a double reef in his fighting tactics while he sparred for time in which
  to recover from the shock of that first blow. The claret was streaming down
  his face and he was dizzy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, wade into him, mate!" urged Joe.</p>

  <p>It is always easier to see what should be done than to do it. The sand was
  not slipping and giving under Joe Byng's feet, nor were his fists and wrists
  aching from contact with hard ebony. To him the thing seemed easy, and he was
  as anxious to get into the fight himself as was the terrier that strained at
  his chain. But Crothers, who had won a hundred fights at least in cleaner
  climes, fought canny and tried to make the black man tire himself with wasted
  effort.</p>

  <p>And the Arabs sat in silence, like a row of vultures waiting for the end.
  Even the little children held their clamor and subsided into motionless calm.
  There was not a movement along the roofs or the wall, or in the rings of
  those who squatted. Arabia was spellbound, watching something she had never
  seen before and trying to puzzle out the wherefore of it. There were knives
  and guns available, yet these men fought without weapons. The white contender
  had a friend, but the friend did not join in. Why? Had Allah struck all three
  men mad? They sat still to see the end, having no doubt but that it would
  prove to be a judgment.</p>

  <p>Curley Crothers was the first to close a round. He put an end to round one
  at the end of three minutes by missing with a heavy right swing, ducking to
  avoid terrific punishment, slipping in the yielding sand and falling.</p>

  <p>"Back with you!" yelled Joe Byng, afraid that the pilot would take
  liberties and ready to jump in and stop him if need be. But he wasted his
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"Ah told you Ah'm English!" said the pilot, stepping back and letting
  Crothers find his corner.</p>

  <p>Curley was glad enough of a rest on Joe Byng's knee, and too intent on
  getting back his wind to listen over carefully to Joe's advice. When Joe
  called "Time" he stepped in readily again; and this time it was Hassan Ah who
  suffered from surprise.</p>

  <p>Curley had been getting out of practise on board ship; he had needed
  waking up, and round one had done it for him. Round two and the six that
  followed it were exhibitions of the "noble art" that men in any of the larger
  cities of the world would have paid out a fortune to have seen.</p>

  <p>There was racial prejudice, and service pride, as well as the usual decent
  man's desire to win to make a real mill of what might have been nothing out
  of ordinary; and there were the quite considerable odds against him that
  &mdash; after the first repulse &mdash; usually make men like Crothers do
  their utmost.</p>

  <p>Even the Arabs lost their stoicism while round two was under way. Byng
  yelled, and the terrier yelped, but the Arabs only shifted their position.
  That, though, was proof enough of their excitement; they actually sighed in
  unison when Hassan Ah thrust his ungainly chin in the way of a crushing
  right-hand smash, and laid his broad back on the sand.</p>

  <p>After that it was slug-and-come-again with both of them, each getting
  wilder as round succeeded round, but neither man obtaining much advantage.
  Twice it was Crothers who went down; then he discovered a soft spot in
  Hassan's ribs, and after that he kept the black man busy on the desperate
  defensive.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt of the end, then, barring accidents. Even Hassan Ah
  could not have doubted it; but he did his black man's uttermost to put it
  off, and he fought as gamely as anybody ever fought since prize-ring rules
  were drafted. He did not foul, or take undue advantage once.</p>

  <p>It was a plain, right-handed, battering-ram punch to the neck that ended
  things, and Hassan Ah lay coughing on the sand with bulging eyes while Joe
  Byng tended Curley's hurts.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't the nigger got any pals?" asked Crothers; and then it occurred to
  Byng that the most hurt man was surely most in need of mending. Both he and
  Crothers bent over him, then, and they soon had him on his feet again.</p>

  <p>"Ah told you Ah'm English!" were the first words he succeeded in
  spluttering through swollen lips.</p>

  <p>"Now, what d'you mean by that exactly?" asked Joe Byng, his attitude
  toward him almost entirely changed. A man who loses gamely is entitled to
  respect if not to friendship.</p>

  <p>Hassan Ah searched in the tattered shirt that he had laid aside, and
  pulled out a folded piece of paper after a lot of fumbling. He opened it
  gingerly, and holding one corner of it displayed the rest with evident
  intention not to allow it out of his grasp.</p>

  <p>"That says Ah'm English!" he explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Crothers, rubbing an injured eye in order to see it better.
  "Can you read, you black heathen?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the pilot. "That says Ah'm English, but Ah can't read!"</p>

  <p>"Well, MacHassan," said Curley Crothers, reading the document a second
  time. "Black or white, you fight like a gentleman. I'm proud to have licked
  you. Good-by, and good luck! Here's my hand!"</p>

  <p>They shook hands, and the seamen started shoreward with the terrier in
  tow.</p>

  <p>"Did you read the paper?" asked Crothers. "It was dated Aden &mdash; non-
  coms' mess of some regiment or other. 'This is to certify that this regiment
  taught Hassan Ah to use his fists, and that he has since licked every single
  mother's son of us!' Pity I didn't see that first, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dunno," said Joe Byng, who had not had to do the fighting. "You
  licked the savage, anyway."</p>

  <p>Hassan Ah was right. There was no more shore leave granted. Crothers and
  Joe Byng were punished with extra duty and "confined to ship" for coming back
  with the marks of fighting on them; and the Puncher gave no further signs of
  life until, some three I days later, her long-suffering engines turned again
  and she departed through the channel that had brought her in.</p>

  <p>Then the sheik and three others and a certain Hassan Ah went down at
  midnight to the jail and lifted with the aid of long poles passed through the
  rings in them the largest floor stones of that vermin-infested building. But
  the vermin did not trouble them. What they were after and what they lifted
  out was the cases of guns and cartridges the Puncher had contrived to
  miss.</p>
