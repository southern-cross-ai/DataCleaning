<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>Foreword</h2>

<p>There has of late years crept so much confusion into the mind of
the student as well as of the general reader as to the identity of
the Scarlet Pimpernel with that of the Gascon Royalist plotter
known to history as the Baron de Batz, that the time seems
opportune for setting all doubts on that subject at rest.</p>

<p>The identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel is in no way whatever
connected with that of the Baron de Batz, and even superficial
reflection will soon bring the mind to the conclusion that great
fundamental differences existed in these two men, in their
personality, in their character, and, above all, in their aims.</p>

<p>According to one or two enthusiastic historians, the Baron de
Batz was the chief agent in a vast network of conspiracy, entirely
supported by foreign money&mdash;both English and
Austrian&mdash;and which had for its object the overthrow of the
Republican Government and the restoration of the monarchy in
France.</p>

<p>In order to attain this political goal, it is averred that he
set himself the task of pitting the members of the revolutionary
Government one against the other, and bringing hatred and
dissensions amongst them, until the cry of "Traitor!" resounded
from one end of the Assembly of the Convention to the other, and
the Assembly itself became as one vast den of wild beasts wherein
wolves and hyenas devoured one another and, still unsatiated,
licked their streaming jaws hungering for more prey.</p>

<p>Those same enthusiastic historians, who have a firm belief in
the so-called "Foreign Conspiracy," ascribe every important event
of the Great Revolution&mdash;be that event the downfall of the
Girondins, the escape of the Dauphin from the Temple, or the death
of Robespierre&mdash;to the intrigues of Baron de Batz. He it was,
so they say, who egged the Jacobins on against the Mountain,
Robespierre against Danton, Hébert against Robespierre. He it was
who instigated the massacres of September, the atrocities of
Nantes, the horrors of Thermidor, the sacrileges, the
<i>noyades</i>: all with the view of causing every section of the
National Assembly to vie with the other in excesses and in cruelty,
until the makers of the Revolution, satiated with their own lust,
turned on one another, and Sardanapalus-like buried themselves and
their orgies in the vast hecatomb of a self-consumed anarchy.</p>

<p>Whether the power thus ascribed to Baron de Batz by his
historians is real or imaginary it is not the purpose of this
preface to investigate. Its sole object is to point out the
difference between the career of this plotter and that of the
Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>The Baron de Batz himself was an adventurer without substance,
save that which he derived from abroad. He was one of those men who
have nothing to lose and everything to gain by throwing themselves
headlong in the seething cauldron of internal politics.</p>

<p>Though he made several attempts at rescuing King Louis first,
and then the Queen and Royal Family from prison and from death, he
never succeeded, as we know, in any of these undertakings, and he
never once so much as attempted the rescue of other equally
innocent, if not quite so distinguished, victims of the most
bloodthirsty revolution that has ever shaken the foundations of the
civilised world.</p>

<p>Nay more; when on the 29th Prairial those unfortunate men and
women were condemned and executed for alleged complicity in the
so-called "Foreign Conspiracy," de Batz, who is universally
admitted to have been the head and prime-mover of that
conspiracy&mdash;if, indeed, conspiracy there was&mdash;never made
either the slightest attempt to rescue his confederates from the
guillotine, or at least the offer to perish by their side if he
could not succeed in saving them.</p>

<p>And when we remember that the martyrs of the 29th Prairial
included women like Grandmaison, the devoted friend of de Batz, the
beautiful Emilie de St. Amaranthe, little Cécile Renault&mdash;a
mere child not sixteen years of age&mdash;also men like Michonis
and Roussell, faithful servants of de Batz, the Baron de
Lézardière, and the Comte de St. Maurice, his friends, we no longer
can have the slightest doubt that the Gascon plotter and the
English gentleman are indeed two very different persons.</p>

<p>The latter's aims were absolutely non-political. He never
intrigued for the restoration of the monarchy, or even for the
overthrow of that Republic which he loathed.</p>

<p>His only concern was the rescue of the innocent, the stretching
out of a saving hand to those unfortunate creatures who had fallen
into the nets spread out for them by their fellow-men; by those
who&mdash;godless, lawless, penniless themselves&mdash;had sworn to
exterminate all those who clung to their belongings, to their
religion, and to their beliefs.</p>

<p>The Scarlet Pimpernel did not take it upon himself to punish the
guilty; his care was solely of the helpless and of the
innocent.</p>

<p>For this aim he risked his life every time that he set foot on
French soil, for it he sacrificed his fortune, and even his
personal happiness, and to it he devoted his entire existence.</p>

<p>Moreover, whereas the French plotter is said to have had
confederates even in the Assembly of the Convention, confederates
who were sufficiently influential and powerful to secure his own
immunity, the Englishman when he was bent on his errands of mercy
had the whole of France against him.</p>

<p>The Baron de Batz was a man who never justified either his own
ambitions or even his existence; the Scarlet Pimpernel was a
personality of whom an entire nation might justly be proud.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1. In The Théâtre
National</h2>

<p>And yet people found the opportunity to amuse themselves, to
dance and to go to the theatre, to enjoy music and open-air cafés
and promenades in the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>New fashions in dress made their appearance, milliners produced
fresh "creations," and jewellers were not idle. A grim sense of
humour, born of the very intensity of ever-present danger, had
dubbed the cut of certain tunics "<i>tête tranchée</i>," or a
favourite <i>ragoût</i> was called "<i>à la guillotine</i>."</p>

<p>On three evenings only during the past memorable four and a half
years did the theatres close their doors, and these evenings were
the ones immediately following that terrible 2nd of September the
day of the butchery outside the Abbaye prison, when Paris herself
was aghast with horror, and the cries of the massacred might have
drowned the calls of the audience whose hands upraised for plaudits
would still be dripping with blood.</p>

<p>On all other evenings of these same four and a half years the
theatres in the Rue de Richelieu, in the Palais Royal, the
Luxembourg, and others, had raised their curtains and taken money
at their doors. The same audience that earlier in the day had
whiled away the time by witnessing the ever-recurrent dramas of the
Place de la Révolution assembled here in the evenings and filled
stalls, boxes, and tiers, laughing over the satires of Voltaire or
weeping over the sentimental tragedies of persecuted Romeos and
innocent Juliets.</p>

<p>Death knocked at so many doors these days! He was so constant a
guest in the houses of relatives and friends that those who had
merely shaken him by the hand, those on whom he had smiled, and
whom he, still smiling, had passed indulgently by, looked on him
with that subtle contempt born of familiarity, shrugged their
shoulders at his passage, and envisaged his probable visit on the
morrow with lighthearted indifference.</p>

<p>Paris&mdash;despite the horrors that had stained her walls had
remained a city of pleasure, and the knife of the guillotine did
scarce descend more often than did the drop-scenes on the
stage.</p>

<p>On this bitterly cold evening of the 27th Nivôse, in the second
year of the Republic&mdash;or, as we of the old style still persist
in calling it, the 16th of January, 1794&mdash;the auditorium of
the Théâtre National was filled with a very brilliant company.</p>

<p>The appearance of a favourite actress in the part of one of
Molière's volatile heroines had brought pleasure-loving Paris to
witness this revival of "Le Misanthrope," with new scenery,
dresses, and the aforesaid charming actress to add piquancy to the
master's mordant wit.</p>

<p>The <i>Moniteur</i>, which so impartially chronicles the events
of those times, tells us under that date that the Assembly of the
Convention voted on that same day a new law giving fuller power to
its spies, enabling them to effect domiciliary searches at their
discretion without previous reference to the Committee of General
Security, authorising them to proceed against all enemies of public
happiness, to send them to prison at their own discretion, and
assuring them the sum of thirty-five livres "for every piece of
game thus beaten up for the guillotine." Under that same date the
<i>Moniteur</i> also puts it on record that the Théâtre National
was filled to its utmost capacity for the revival of the late
citoyen Molière's comedy.</p>

<p>The Assembly of the Convention having voted the new law which
placed the lives of thousands at the mercy of a few human
bloodhounds, adjourned its sitting and proceeded to the Rue de
Richelieu.</p>

<p>Already the house was full when the fathers of the people made
their way to the seats which had been reserved for them. An awed
hush descended on the throng as one by one the men whose very names
inspired horror and dread filed in through the narrow gangways of
the stalls or took their places in the tiny boxes around.</p>

<p>Citizen Robespierre's neatly bewigged head soon appeared in one
of these; his bosom friend St. Just was with him, and also his
sister Charlotte. Danton, like a big, shaggy-coated lion, elbowed
his way into the stalls, whilst Sauterre, the handsome butcher and
idol of the people of Paris, was loudly acclaimed as his huge
frame, gorgeously clad in the uniform of the National Guard, was
sighted on one of the tiers above.</p>

<p>The public in the parterre and in the galleries whispered
excitedly; the awe-inspiring names flew about hither and thither on
the wings of the overheated air. Women craned their necks to catch
sight of heads which mayhap on the morrow would roll into the
gruesome basket at the foot of the guillotine.</p>

<p>In one of the tiny <i>avant-scène</i> boxes two men had taken
their seats long before the bulk of the audience had begun to
assemble in the house. The inside of the box was in complete
darkness, and the narrow opening which allowed but a sorry view of
one side of the stage helped to conceal rather than display the
occupants.</p>

<p>The younger one of these two men appeared to be something of a
stranger in Paris, for as the public men and the well-known members
of the Government began to arrive he often turned to his companion
for information regarding these notorious personalities.</p>

<p>"Tell me, de Batz," he said, calling the other's attention to a
group of men who had just entered the house, "that creature there
in the green coat&mdash;with his hand up to his face now&mdash;who
is he?"</p>

<p>"Where? Which do you mean?"</p>

<p>"There! He looks this way now, and he has a playbill in his
hand. The man with the protruding chin and the convex forehead, a
face like a marmoset, and eyes like a jackal. What?"</p>

<p>The other leaned over the edge of the box, and his small,
restless eyes wandered over the now closely-packed auditorium.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said as soon as he recognised the face which his friend
had pointed out to him, "that is citizen Foucquier-Tinville."</p>

<p>"The Public Prosecutor?"</p>

<p>"Himself. And Héron is the man next to him."</p>

<p>"Héron?" said the younger man interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Yes. He is chief agent to the Committee of General Security
now."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>Both leaned back in their chairs, and their sombrely-clad
figures were once more merged in the gloom of the narrow box.
Instinctively, since the name of the Public Prosecutor had been
mentioned between them, they had allowed their voices to sink to a
whisper.</p>

<p>The older man&mdash;a stoutish, florid-looking individual, with
small, keen eyes, and skin pitted with small-pox&mdash;shrugged his
shoulders at his friend's question, and then said with an air of
contemptuous indifference:</p>

<p>"It means, my good St. Just, that these two men whom you see
down there, calmly conning the programme of this evening's
entertainment, and preparing to enjoy themselves to-night in the
company of the late M. de Molière, are two hell-hounds as powerful
as they are cunning."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said St. Just, and much against his will a slight
shudder ran through his slim figure as he spoke.
"Foucquier-Tinville I know; I know his cunning, and I know his
power&mdash;but the other?"</p>

<p>"The other?" retorted de Batz lightly. "Héron? Let me tell you,
my friend, that even the might and lust of that damned Public
Prosecutor pale before the power of Héron!"</p>

<p>"But how? I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Ah! you have been in England so long, you lucky dog, and though
no doubt the main plot of our hideous tragedy has reached your ken,
you have no cognisance of the actors who play the principal parts
on this arena flooded with blood and carpeted with hate. They come
and go, these actors, my good St. Just&mdash;they come and go.
Marat is already the man of yesterday, Robespierre is the man of
to-morrow. To-day we still have Danton and Foucquier-Tinville; we
still have Père Duchesne, and your own good cousin Antoine St.
Just, but Héron and his like are with us always."</p>

<p>"Spies, of course?"</p>

<p>"Spies," assented the other. "And what spies! Were you present
at the sitting of the Assembly to-day?"</p>

<p>"I was. I heard the new decree which already has passed into
law. Ah! I tell you, friend, that we do not let the grass grow
under our feet these days. Robespierre wakes up one morning with a
whim; by the afternoon that whim has become law, passed by a
servile body of men too terrified to run counter to his will,
fearful lest they be accused of moderation or of humanity&mdash;the
greatest crimes that can be committed nowadays."</p>

<p>"But Danton?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Danton? He would wish to stem the tide that his own
passions have let loose; to muzzle the raging beasts whose fangs he
himself has sharpened. I told you that Danton is still the man of
to-day; to-morrow he will be accused of moderation. Danton and
moderation!&mdash;ye gods! Eh? Danton, who thought the guillotine
too slow in its work, and armed thirty soldiers with swords, so
that thirty heads might fall at one and the same time. Danton,
friend, will perish to-morrow accused of treachery against the
Revolution, of moderation towards her enemies; and curs like Héron
will feast on the blood of lions like Danton and his crowd."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, for he dared not raise his voice, and his
whispers were being drowned by the noise in the auditorium. The
curtain, timed to be raised at eight o'clock, was still down,
though it was close on half-past, and the public was growing
impatient. There was loud stamping of feet, and a few shrill
whistles of disapproval proceeded from the gallery.</p>

<p>"If Héron gets impatient," said de Batz lightly, when the noise
had momentarily subsided, "the manager of this theatre and mayhap
his leading actor and actress will spend an unpleasant day
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Always Héron!" said St. Just, with a contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend," rejoined the other imperturbably, "always
Héron. And he has even obtained a longer lease of existence this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"By the new decree?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The new decree. The agents of the Committee of General
Security, of whom Héron is the chief, have from to-day powers of
domiciliary search; they have full powers to proceed against all
enemies of public welfare. Isn't that beautifully vague? And they
have absolute discretion; every one may become an enemy of public
welfare, either by spending too much money or by spending too
little, by laughing to-day or crying to-morrow, by mourning for one
dead relative or rejoicing over the execution of another. He may be
a bad example to the public by the cleanliness of his person or by
the filth upon his clothes, he may offend by walking to-day and by
riding in a carriage next week; the agents of the Committee of
General Security shall alone decide what constitutes enmity against
public welfare. All prisons are to be opened at their bidding to
receive those whom they choose to denounce; they have henceforth
the right to examine prisoners privately and without witnesses, and
to send them to trial without further warrants; their duty is
clear&mdash;they must 'beat up game for the guillotine.' Thus is
the decree worded; they must furnish the Public Prosecutor with
work to do, the tribunals with victims to condemn, the Place de la
Révolution with death-scenes to amuse the people, and for their
work they will be rewarded thirty-five livres for every head that
falls under the guillotine Ah! if Héron and his like and his
myrmidons work hard and well they can make a comfortable income of
four or five thousand livres a week. We are getting on, friend St.
Just&mdash;we are getting on."</p>

<p>He had not raised his voice while he spoke, nor in the
recounting of such inhuman monstrosity, such vile and bloodthirsty
conspiracy against the liberty, the dignity, the very life of an
entire nation, did he appear to feel the slightest indignation;
rather did a tone of amusement and even of triumph strike through
his speech; and now he laughed good-humouredly like an indulgent
parent who is watching the naturally cruel antics of a spoilt
boy.</p>

<p>"Then from this hell let loose upon earth," exclaimed St. Just
hotly, "must we rescue those who refuse to ride upon this tide of
blood."</p>

<p>His cheeks were glowing, his eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. He
looked very young and very eager. Armand St. Just, the brother of
Lady Blakeney, had something of the refined beauty of his lovely
sister, but the features though manly&mdash;had not the latent
strength expressed in them which characterised every line of
Marguerite's exquisite face. The forehead suggested a dreamer
rather than a thinker, the blue-grey eyes were those of an idealist
rather than of a man of action.</p>

<p>De Batz's keen piercing eyes had no doubt noted this, even
whilst he gazed at his young friend with that same look of
good-humoured indulgence which seemed habitual to him.</p>

<p>"We have to think of the future, my good St. Just," he said
after a slight pause, and speaking slowly and decisively, like a
father rebuking a hot-headed child, "not of the present. What are a
few lives worth beside the great principles which we have at
stake?"</p>

<p>"The restoration of the monarchy&mdash;I know," retorted St.
Just, still unsobered, "but, in the meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile," rejoined de Batz earnestly, "every victim to
the lust of these men is a step towards the restoration of law and
order&mdash;that is to say, of the monarchy. It is only through
these violent excesses perpetrated in its name that the nation will
realise how it is being fooled by a set of men who have only their
own power and their own advancement in view, and who imagine that
the only way to that power is over the dead bodies of those who
stand in their way. Once the nation is sickened by these orgies of
ambition and of hate, it will turn against these savage brutes, and
gladly acclaim the restoration of all that they are striving to
destroy. This is our only hope for the future, and, believe me,
friend, that every head snatched from the guillotine by your
romantic hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, is a stone laid for the
consolidation of this infamous Republic."</p>

<p>"I'll not believe it," protested St. Just emphatically.</p>

<p>De Batz, with a gesture of contempt indicative also of complete
self-satisfaction and unalterable self-belief, shrugged his broad
shoulders. His short fat fingers, covered with rings, beat a tattoo
upon the ledge of the box.</p>

<p>Obviously, he was ready with a retort. His young friend's
attitude irritated even more than it amused him. But he said
nothing for the moment, waiting while the traditional three knocks
on the floor of the stage proclaimed the rise of the curtain. The
growing impatience of the audience subsided as if by magic at the
welcome call; everybody settled down again comfortably in their
seats, they gave up the contemplation of the fathers of the people,
and turned their full attention to the actors on the boards.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2. Widely Divergent
Aims</h2>

<p>This was Armand St. Just's first visit to Paris since that
memorable day when first he decided to sever his connection from
the Republican party, of which he and his beautiful sister
Marguerite had at one time been amongst the most noble, most
enthusiastic followers. Already a year and a half ago the excesses
of the party had horrified him, and that was long before they had
degenerated into the sickening orgies which were culminating to-day
in wholesale massacres and bloody hecatombs of innocent
victims.</p>

<p>With the death of Mirabeau the moderate Republicans, whose sole
and entirely pure aim had been to free the people of France from
the autocratic tyranny of the Bourbons, saw the power go from their
clean hands to the grimy ones of lustful demagogues, who knew no
law save their own passions of bitter hatred against all classes
that were not as self-seeking, as ferocious as themselves.</p>

<p>It was no longer a question of a fight for political and
religious liberty only, but one of class against class, man against
man, and let the weaker look to himself. The weaker had proved
himself to be, firstly, the man of property and substance, then the
law-abiding citizen, lastly the man of action who had obtained for
the people that very same liberty of thought and of belief which
soon became so terribly misused.</p>

<p>Armand St. Just, one of the apostles of liberty, fraternity, and
equality, soon found that the most savage excesses of tyranny were
being perpetrated in the name of those same ideals which he had
worshipped.</p>

<p>His sister Marguerite, happily married in England, was the final
temptation which caused him to quit the country the destinies of
which he no longer could help to control. The spark of enthusiasm
which he and the followers of Mirabeau had tried to kindle in the
hearts of an oppressed people had turned to raging tongues of
unquenchable flames. The taking of the Bastille had been the
prelude to the massacres of September, and even the horror of these
had since paled beside the holocausts of to-day.</p>

<p>Armand, saved from the swift vengeance of the revolutionaries by
the devotion of the Scarlet Pimpernel, crossed over to England and
enrolled himself under the banner of the heroic chief. But he had
been unable hitherto to be an active member of the League. The
chief was loath to allow him to run foolhardy risks. The St.
Justs&mdash;both Marguerite and Armand&mdash;were still very
well-known in Paris. Marguerite was not a woman easily forgotten,
and her marriage with an English "aristo" did not please those
republican circles who had looked upon her as their queen. Armand's
secession from his party into the ranks of the <i>émigrés</i> had
singled him out for special reprisals, if and whenever he could be
got hold of, and both brother and sister had an unusually bitter
enemy in their cousin Antoine St. Just&mdash;once an aspirant to
Marguerite's hand, and now a servile adherent and imitator of
Robespierre, whose ferocious cruelty he tried to emulate with a
view to ingratiating himself with the most powerful man of the
day.</p>

<p>Nothing would have pleased Antoine St. Just more than the
opportunity of showing his zeal and his patriotism by denouncing
his own kith and kin to the Tribunal of the Terror, and the Scarlet
Pimpernel, whose own slender fingers were held on the pulse of that
reckless revolution, had no wish to sacrifice Armand's life
deliberately, or even to expose it to unnecessary dangers.</p>

<p>Thus it was that more than a year had gone by before Armand St.
Just&mdash;an enthusiastic member of the League of the Scarlet
Pimpernel&mdash;was able to do aught for its service. He had chafed
under the enforced restraint placed upon him by the prudence of his
chief, when, indeed, he was longing to risk his life with the
comrades whom he loved and beside the leader whom he revered.</p>

<p>At last, in the beginning of '94 he persuaded Blakeney to allow
him to join the next expedition to France. What the principal aim
of that expedition was the members of the League did not know as
yet, but what they did know was that perils&mdash;graver even than
hitherto&mdash;would attend them on their way.</p>

<p>The circumstances had become very different of late. At first
the impenetrable mystery which had surrounded the personality of
the chief had been a full measure of safety, but now one tiny
corner of that veil of mystery had been lifted by two rough pairs
of hands at least; Chauvelin, ex-ambassador at the English Court,
was no longer in any doubt as to the identity of the Scarlet
Pimpernel, whilst Collot d'Herbois had seen him at Boulogne, and
had there been effectually foiled by him.</p>

<p>Four months had gone by since that day, and the Scarlet
Pimpernel was hardly ever out of France now; the massacres in Paris
and in the provinces had multiplied with appalling rapidity, the
necessity for the selfless devotion of that small band of heroes
had become daily, hourly more pressing. They rallied round their
chief with unbounded enthusiasm, and let it be admitted at once
that the sporting instinct&mdash;inherent in these English
gentlemen&mdash;made them all the more keen, all the more eager now
that the dangers which beset their expeditions were increased
tenfold.</p>

<p>At a word from the beloved leader, these young men&mdash;the
spoilt darlings of society&mdash;would leave the gaieties, the
pleasures, the luxuries of London or of Bath, and, taking their
lives in their hands, they placed them, together with their
fortunes, and even their good names, at the service of the innocent
and helpless victims of merciless tyranny. The married
men&mdash;Ffoulkes, my Lord Hastings, Sir Jeremiah
Wallescourt&mdash;left wife and children at a call from the chief,
at the cry of the wretched. Armand&mdash;unattached and
enthusiastic&mdash;had the right to demand that he should no longer
be left behind.</p>

<p>He had only been away a little over fifteen months, and yet he
found Paris a different city from the one he had left immediately
after the terrible massacres of September. An air of grim
loneliness seemed to hang over her despite the crowds that thronged
her streets; the men whom he was wont to meet in public places
fifteen months ago&mdash;friends and political allies&mdash;were no
longer to be seen; strange faces surrounded him on every
side&mdash;sullen, glowering faces, all wearing a certain air of
horrified surprise and of vague, terrified wonder, as if life had
become one awful puzzle, the answer to which must be found in the
brief interval between the swift passages of death.</p>

<p>Armand St. Just, having settled his few simple belongings in the
squalid lodgings which had been assigned to him, had started out
after dark to wander somewhat aimlessly through the streets.
Instinctively he seemed to be searching for a familiar face, some
one who would come to him out of that merry past which he had spent
with Marguerite in their pretty apartment in the Rue St.
Honoré.</p>

<p>For an hour he wandered thus and met no one whom he knew. At
times it appeared to him as if he did recognise a face or figure
that passed him swiftly by in the gloom, but even before he could
fully make up his mind to that, the face or figure had already
disappeared, gliding furtively down some narrow unlighted
by-street, without turning to look to right or left, as if dreading
fuller recognition. Armand felt a total stranger in his own native
city.</p>

<p>The terrible hours of the execution on the Place de la
Révolution were fortunately over, the tumbrils no longer rattled
along the uneven pavements, nor did the death-cry of the
unfortunate victims resound through the deserted streets. Armand
was, on this first day of his arrival, spared the sight of this
degradation of the once lovely city; but her desolation, her
general appearance of shamefaced indigence and of cruel aloofness
struck a chill in the young man's heart.</p>

<p>It was no wonder, therefore, when anon he was wending his way
slowly back to his lodging he was accosted by a pleasant, cheerful
voice, that he responded to it with alacrity. The voice, of a
smooth, oily <i>timbre</i>, as if the owner kept it well greased
for purposes of amiable speech, was like an echo of the past, when
jolly, irresponsible Baron de Batz, erst-while officer of the Guard
in the service of the late King, and since then known to be the
most inveterate conspirator for the restoration of the monarchy,
used to amuse Marguerite by his vapid, senseless plans for the
overthrow of the newly-risen power of the people.</p>

<p>Armand was quite glad to meet him, and when de Batz suggested
that a good talk over old times would be vastly agreeable, the
younger man gladly acceded. The two men, though certainly not
mistrustful of one another, did not seem to care to reveal to each
other the place where they lodged. De Batz at once proposed the
<i>avant-scène</i> box of one of the theatres as being the safest
place where old friends could talk without fear of spying eyes or
ears.</p>

<p>"There is no place so safe or so private nowadays, believe me,
my young friend," he said, "I have tried every sort of nook and
cranny in this accursed town, now riddled with spies, and I have
come to the conclusion that a small <i>avant-scène</i> box is the
most perfect den of privacy there is in the entire city. The voices
of the actors on the stage and the hum among the audience in the
house will effectually drown all individual conversation to every
ear save the one for whom it is intended."</p>

<p>It is not difficult to persuade a young man who feels lonely and
somewhat forlorn in a large city to while away an evening in the
companionship of a cheerful talker, and de Batz was essentially
good company. His vapourings had always been amusing, but Armand
now gave him credit for more seriousness of purpose; and though the
chief had warned him against picking up acquaintances in Paris, the
young man felt that that restriction would certainly not apply to a
man like de Batz, whose hot partisanship of the Royalist cause and
hare-brained schemes for its restoration must make him at one with
the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Armand accepted the other's cordial invitation. He, too, felt
that he would indeed be safer from observation in a crowded theatre
than in the streets. Among a closely packed throng bent on
amusement the sombrely-clad figure of a young man, with the
appearance of a student or of a journalist, would easily pass
unperceived.</p>

<p>But somehow, after the first ten minutes spent in de Batz'
company within the gloomy shelter of the small <i>avant-scène</i>
box, Armand already repented of the impulse which had prompted him
to come to the theatre to-night, and to renew acquaintanceship with
the ex-officer of the late King's Guard. Though he knew de Batz to
be an ardent Royalist, and even an active adherent of the monarchy,
he was soon conscious of a vague sense of mistrust of this pompous,
self-complacent individual, whose every utterance breathed selfish
aims rather than devotion to a forlorn cause.</p>

<p>Therefore, when the curtain rose at last on the first act of
Molière's witty comedy, St. Just turned deliberately towards the
stage and tried to interest himself in the wordy quarrel between
Philinte and Alceste.</p>

<p>But this attitude on the part of the younger man did not seem to
suit his newly-found friend. It was clear that de Batz did not
consider the topic of conversation by any means exhausted, and that
it had been more with a view to a discussion like the present
interrupted one that he had invited St. Just to come to the theatre
with him to-night, rather than for the purpose of witnessing Mlle.
Lange's <i>début</i> in the part of Célimène.</p>

<p>The presence of St. Just in Paris had as a matter of fact
astonished de Batz not a little, and had set his intriguing brain
busy on conjectures. It was in order to turn these conjectures into
certainties that he had desired private talk with the young
man.</p>

<p>He waited silently now for a moment or two, his keen, small eyes
resting with evident anxiety on Armand's averted head, his fingers
still beating the impatient tattoo upon the velvet-covered cushion
of the box. Then at the first movement of St. Just towards him he
was ready in an instant to re-open the subject under
discussion.</p>

<p>With a quick nod of his head he called his young friend's
attention back to the men in the auditorium.</p>

<p>"Your good cousin Antoine St. Just is hand and glove with
Robespierre now," he said. "When you left Paris more than a year
ago you could afford to despise him as an empty-headed windbag;
now, if you desire to remain in France, you will have to fear him
as a power and a menace."</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew that he had taken to herding with the wolves,"
rejoined Armand lightly. "At one time he was in love with my
sister. I thank God that she never cared for him."</p>

<p>"They say that he herds with the wolves because of this
disappointment," said de Batz. "The whole pack is made up of men
who have been disappointed, and who have nothing more to lose. When
all these wolves will have devoured one another, then and then only
can we hope for the restoration of the monarchy in France. And they
will not turn on one another whilst prey for their greed lies ready
to their jaws. Your friend the Scarlet Pimpernel should feed this
bloody revolution of ours rather than starve it, if indeed he hates
it as he seems to do."</p>

<p>His restless eyes peered with eager interrogation into those of
the younger man. He paused as if waiting for a reply; then, as St.
Just remained silent, he reiterated slowly, almost in the tones of
a challenge:</p>

<p>"If indeed he hates this bloodthirsty revolution of ours as he
seems to do."</p>

<p>The reiteration implied a doubt. In a moment St. Just's loyalty
was up in arms.</p>

<p>"The Scarlet Pimpernel," he said, "cares naught for your
political aims. The work of mercy that he does, he does for justice
and for humanity."</p>

<p>"And for sport," said de Batz with a sneer, "so I've been
told."</p>

<p>"He is English," assented St. Just, "and as such will never own
to sentiment. Whatever be the motive, look at the result!"</p>

<p>"Yes! a few lives stolen from the guillotine."</p>

<p>"Women and children&mdash;innocent victims&mdash;would have
perished but for his devotion."</p>

<p>"The more innocent they were, the more helpless, the more
pitiable, the louder would their blood have cried for reprisals
against the wild beasts who sent them to their death."</p>

<p>St. Just made no reply. It was obviously useless to attempt to
argue with this man, whose political aims were as far apart from
those of the Scarlet Pimpernel as was the North Pole from the
South.</p>

<p>"If any of you have influence over that hot-headed leader of
yours," continued de Batz, unabashed by the silence of his friend,
"I wish to God you would exert it now."</p>

<p>"In what way?" queried St. Just, smiling in spite of himself at
the thought of his or any one else's control over Blakeney and his
plans.</p>

<p>It was de Batz' turn to be silent. He paused for a moment or
two, then he asked abruptly:</p>

<p>"Your Scarlet Pimpernel is in Paris now, is he not?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," replied Armand.</p>

<p>"Bah! there is no necessity to fence with me, my friend. The
moment I set eyes on you this afternoon I knew that you had not
come to Paris alone."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, my good de Batz," rejoined the young man
earnestly; "I came to Paris alone."</p>

<p>"Clever parrying, on my word&mdash;but wholly wasted on my
unbelieving ears. Did I not note at once that you did not seem
overpleased to-day when I accosted you?"</p>

<p>"Again you are mistaken. I was very pleased to meet you, for I
had felt singularly lonely all day, and was glad to shake a friend
by the hand. What you took for displeasure was only surprise."</p>

<p>"Surprise? Ah, yes! I don't wonder that you were surprised to
see me walking unmolested and openly in the streets of
Paris&mdash;whereas you had heard of me as a dangerous conspirator,
eh?&mdash;and as a man who has the entire police of his country at
his heels&mdash;on whose head there is a price&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"I knew that you had made several noble efforts to rescue the
unfortunate King and Queen from the hands of these brutes."</p>

<p>"All of which efforts were unsuccessful," assented de Batz
imperturbably, "every one of them having been either betrayed by
some d----d confederate or ferreted out by some astute spy eager
for gain. Yes, my friend, I made several efforts to rescue King
Louis and Queen Marie Antoinette from the scaffold, and every time
I was foiled, and yet here I am, you see, unscathed and free. I
walk about the streets boldly, and talk to my friends as I meet
them."</p>

<p>"You are lucky," said St. Just, not without a tinge of
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"I have been prudent," retorted de Batz. "I have taken the
trouble to make friends there where I thought I needed them
most&mdash;the mammon of unrighteousness, you know-what?"</p>

<p>And he laughed a broad, thick laugh of perfect
self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," rejoined St. Just, with the tone of sarcasm still
more apparent in his voice now. "You have Austrian money at your
disposal."</p>

<p>"Any amount," said the other complacently, "and a great deal of
it sticks to the grimy fingers of these patriotic makers of
revolutions. Thus do I ensure my own safety. I buy it with the
Emperor's money, and thus am I able to work for the restoration of
the monarchy in France."</p>

<p>Again St. Just was silent. What could he say? Instinctively now,
as the fleshy personality of the Gascon Royalist seemed to spread
itself out and to fill the tiny box with his ambitious schemes and
his far-reaching plans, Armand's thoughts flew back to that other
plotter, the man with the pure and simple aims, the man whose
slender fingers had never handled alien gold, but were ever there
ready stretched out to the helpless and the weak, whilst his
thoughts were only of the help that he might give them, but never
of his own safety.</p>

<p>De Batz, however, seemed blandly unconscious of any such
disparaging thoughts in the mind of his young friend, for he
continued quite amiably, even though a note of anxiety seemed to
make itself felt now in his smooth voice:</p>

<p>"We advance slowly, but step by step, my good St. Just," he
said. "I have not been able to save the monarchy in the person of
the King or the Queen, but I may yet do it in the person of the
Dauphin."</p>

<p>"The Dauphin," murmured St. Just involuntarily.</p>

<p>That involuntary murmur, scarcely audible, so soft was it,
seemed in some way to satisfy de Batz, for the keenness of his gaze
relaxed, and his fat fingers ceased their nervous, intermittent
tattoo on the ledge of the box.</p>

<p>"Yes! the Dauphin," he said, nodding his head as if in answer to
his own thoughts, "or rather, let me say, the reigning King of
France&mdash;Louis XVII, by the grace of God&mdash;the most
precious life at present upon the whole of this earth."</p>

<p>"You are right there, friend de Batz," assented Armand
fervently, "the most precious life, as you say, and one that must
be saved at all costs."</p>

<p>"Yes," said de Batz calmly, "but not by your friend the Scarlet
Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Scarce were those two little words out of St. Just's mouth than
he repented of them. He bit his lip, and with a dark frown upon his
face he turned almost defiantly towards his friend.</p>

<p>But de Batz smiled with easy <i>bonhomie</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah, friend Armand," he said, "you were not cut out for
diplomacy, nor yet for intrigue. So then," he added more seriously,
"that gallant hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, has hopes of rescuing
our young King from the clutches of Simon the cobbler and of the
herd of hyenas on the watch for his attenuated little corpse,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I did not say that," retorted St. Just sullenly.</p>

<p>"No. But I say it. Nay! nay! do not blame yourself, my
over-loyal young friend. Could I, or any one else, doubt for a
moment that sooner or later your romantic hero would turn his
attention to the most pathetic sight in the whole of
Europe&mdash;the child-martyr in the Temple prison? The wonder were
to me if the Scarlet Pimpernel ignored our little King altogether
for the sake of his subjects. No, no; do not think for a moment
that you have betrayed your friend's secret to me. When I met you
so luckily today I guessed at once that you were here under the
banner of the enigmatical little red flower, and, thus guessing, I
even went a step further in my conjecture. The Scarlet Pimpernel is
in Paris now in the hope of rescuing Louis XVII from the Temple
prison."</p>

<p>"If that is so, you must not only rejoice but should be able to
help."</p>

<p>"And yet, my friend, I do neither the one now nor mean to do the
other in the future," said de Batz placidly. "I happen to be a
Frenchman, you see."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with such a question?"</p>

<p>"Everything; though you, Armand, despite that you are a
Frenchman too, do not look through my spectacles. Louis XVII is
King of France, my good St. Just; he must owe his freedom and his
life to us Frenchmen, and to no one else."</p>

<p>"That is sheer madness, man," retorted Armand. "Would you have
the child perish for the sake of your own selfish ideas?"</p>

<p>"You may call them selfish if you will; all patriotism is in a
measure selfish. What does the rest of the world care if we are a
republic or a monarchy, an oligarchy or hopeless anarchy? We work
for ourselves and to please ourselves, and I for one will not brook
foreign interference."</p>

<p>"Yet you work with foreign money!"</p>

<p>"That is another matter. I cannot get money in France, so I get
it where I can; but I can arrange for the escape of Louis XVII from
the Temple Prison, and to us Royalists of France should belong the
honour and glory of having saved our King."</p>

<p>For the third time now St. Just allowed the conversation to
drop; he was gazing wide-eyed, almost appalled at this impudent
display of well-nigh ferocious selfishness and vanity. De Batz,
smiling and complacent, was leaning back in his chair, looking at
his young friend with perfect contentment expressed in every line
of his pock-marked face and in the very attitude of his well-fed
body. It was easy enough now to understand the remarkable immunity
which this man was enjoying, despite the many foolhardy plots which
he hatched, and which had up to now invariably come to naught.</p>

<p>A regular braggart and empty windbag, he had taken but one good
care, and that was of his own skin. Unlike other less fortunate
Royalists of France, he neither fought in the country nor braved
dangers in town. He played a safer game&mdash;crossed the frontier
and constituted himself agent of Austria; he succeeded in gaining
the Emperor's money for the good of the Royalist cause, and for his
own most especial benefit.</p>

<p>Even a less astute man of the world than was Armand St. Just
would easily have guessed that de Batz' desire to be the only
instrument in the rescue of the poor little Dauphin from the Temple
was not actuated by patriotism, but solely by greed. Obviously
there was a rich reward waiting for him in Vienna the day that he
brought Louis XVII safely into Austrian territory; that reward he
would miss if a meddlesome Englishman interfered in this affair.
Whether in this wrangle he risked the life of the child-King or not
mattered to him not at all. It was de Batz who was to get the
reward, and whose welfare and prosperity mattered more than the
most precious life in Europe.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3. The Demon Chance</h2>

<p>St. Just would have given much to be back in his lonely squalid
lodgings now. Too late did he realise how wise had been the dictum
which had warned him against making or renewing friendships in
France.</p>

<p>Men had changed with the times. How terribly they had changed!
Personal safety had become a fetish with most&mdash;a goal so
difficult to attain that it had to be fought for and striven for,
even at the expense of humanity and of self-respect.</p>

<p>Selfishness&mdash;the mere, cold-blooded insistence for
self-advancement&mdash;ruled supreme. De Batz, surfeited with
foreign money, used it firstly to ensure his own immunity,
scattering it to right and left to still the ambition of the Public
Prosecutor or to satisfy the greed of innumerable spies.</p>

<p>What was left over he used for the purpose of pitting the
bloodthirsty demagogues one against the other, making of the
National Assembly a gigantic bear-den, wherein wild beasts could
rend one another limb from limb.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, what cared he&mdash;he said it
himself&mdash;whether hundreds of innocent martyrs perished
miserably and uselessly? They were the necessary food whereby the
Revolution was to be satiated and de Batz' schemes enabled to
mature. The most precious life in Europe even was only to be saved
if its price went to swell the pockets of de Batz, or to further
his future ambitions.</p>

<p>Times had indeed changed an entire nation. St. Just felt as
sickened with this self-seeking Royalist as he did with the savage
brutes who struck to right or left for their own delectation. He
was meditating immediate flight back to his lodgings, with a hope
of finding there a word for him from the chief&mdash;a word to
remind him that men did live nowadays who had other aims besides
their own advancement&mdash;other ideals besides the deification of
self.</p>

<p>The curtain had descended on the first act, and traditionally,
as the works of M. de Molière demanded it, the three knocks were
heard again without any interval. St. Just rose ready with a
pretext for parting with his friend. The curtain was being slowly
drawn up on the second act, and disclosed Alceste in wrathful
conversation with Célimène.</p>

<p>Alceste's opening speech is short. Whilst the actor spoke it
Armand had his back to the stage; with hand outstretched, he was
murmuring what he hoped would prove a polite excuse for thus
leaving his amiable host while the entertainment had only just
begun.</p>

<p>De Batz&mdash;vexed and impatient&mdash;had not by any means
finished with his friend yet. He thought that his specious
arguments&mdash;delivered with boundless conviction&mdash;had made
some impression on the mind of the young man. That impression,
however, he desired to deepen, and whilst Armand was worrying his
brain to find a plausible excuse for going away, de Batz was
racking his to find one for keeping him here.</p>

<p>Then it was that the wayward demon Chance intervened. Had St.
Just risen but two minutes earlier, had his active mind suggested
the desired excuse more readily, who knows what unspeakable sorrow,
what heartrending misery, what terrible shame might have been
spared both him and those for whom he cared? Those two
minutes&mdash;did he but know it&mdash;decided the whole course of
his future life. The excuse hovered on his lips, de Batz
reluctantly was preparing to bid him good-bye, when Célimène,
speaking common-place words enough in answer to her quarrelsome
lover, caused him to drop the hand which he was holding out to his
friend and to turn back towards the stage.</p>

<p>It was an exquisite voice that had spoken&mdash;a voice mellow
and tender, with deep tones in it that betrayed latent power. The
voice had caused Armand to look, the lips that spoke forged the
first tiny link of that chain which riveted him forever after to
the speaker.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say if such a thing really exists as love at
first sight. Poets and romancists will have us believe that it
does; idealists swear by it as being the only true love worthy of
the name.</p>

<p>I do not know if I am prepared to admit their theory with regard
to Armand St. Just. Mlle. Lange's exquisite voice certainly had
charmed him to the extent of making him forget his mistrust of de
Batz and his desire to get away. Mechanically almost he sat down
again, and leaning both elbows on the edge of the box, he rested
his chin in his hand, and listened. The words which the late M. de
Molière puts into the mouth of Célimène are trite and flippant
enough, yet every time that Mlle. Lange's lips moved Armand watched
her, entranced.</p>

<p>There, no doubt, the matter would have ended: a young man
fascinated by a pretty woman on the stage&mdash;'tis a small
matter, and one from which there doth not often spring a weary
trail of tragic circumstances. Armand, who had a passion for music,
would have worshipped at the shrine of Mlle. Lange's perfect voice
until the curtain came down on the last act, had not his friend de
Batz seen the keen enchantment which the actress had produced on
the young enthusiast.</p>

<p>Now de Batz was a man who never allowed an opportunity to slip
by, if that opportunity led towards the furtherance of his own
desires. He did not want to lose sight of Armand just yet, and here
the good demon Chance had given him an opportunity for obtaining
what he wanted.</p>

<p>He waited quietly until the fall of the curtain at the end of
Act II.; then, as Armand, with a sigh of delight, leaned back in
his chair, and closing his eyes appeared to be living the last
half-hour all over again, de Batz remarked with well-assumed
indifference:</p>

<p>"Mlle. Lange is a promising young actress. Do you not think so,
my friend?"</p>

<p>"She has a perfect voice&mdash;it was exquisite melody to the
ear," replied Armand. "I was conscious of little else."</p>

<p>"She is a beautiful woman, nevertheless," continued de Batz with
a smile. "During the next act, my good St. Just, I would suggest
that you open your eyes as well as your ears."</p>

<p>Armand did as he was bidden. The whole appearance of Mlle. Lange
seemed in harmony with her voice. She was not very tall, but
eminently graceful, with a small, oval face and slender, almost
childlike figure, which appeared still more so above the wide hoops
and draped panniers of the fashions of Molière's time.</p>

<p>Whether she was beautiful or not the young man hardly knew.
Measured by certain standards, she certainly was not so, for her
mouth was not small, and her nose anything but classical in
outline. But the eyes were brown, and they had that half-veiled
look in them&mdash;shaded with long lashes that seemed to make a
perpetual tender appeal to the masculine heart: the lips, too, were
full and moist, and the teeth dazzling white. Yes!&mdash;on the
whole we might easily say that she was exquisite, even though we
did not admit that she was beautiful.</p>

<p>Painter David has made a sketch of her; we have all seen it at
the Musée Carnavalet, and all wondered why that charming, if
irregular, little face made such an impression of sadness.</p>

<p>There are five acts in "Le Misanthrope," during which Célimène
is almost constantly on the stage. At the end of the fourth act de
Batz said casually to his friend:</p>

<p>"I have the honour of personal acquaintanceship with Mlle.
Lange. An you care for an introduction to her, we can go round to
the green-room after the play."</p>

<p>Did prudence then whisper, "Desist?" Did loyalty to the leader
murmur, "Obey?" It were indeed difficult to say. Armand St. Just
was not five-and-twenty, and Mlle. Lange's melodious voice spoke
louder than the whisperings of prudence or even than the call of
duty.</p>

<p>He thanked de Batz warmly, and during the last half-hour, while
the misanthropical lover spurned repentant Célimène, he was
conscious of a curious sensation of impatience, a tingling of his
nerves, a wild, mad longing to hear those full moist lips pronounce
his name, and have those large brown eyes throw their half-veiled
look into his own.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4. Mademoiselle Lange</h2>

<p>The green-room was crowded when de Batz and St. Just arrived
there after the performance. The older man cast a hasty glance
through the open door. The crowd did not suit his purpose, and he
dragged his companion hurriedly away from the contemplation of
Mlle. Lange, sitting in a far corner of the room, surrounded by an
admiring throng, and by innumerable floral tributes offered to her
beauty and to her success.</p>

<p>De Batz without a word led the way back towards the stage. Here,
by the dim light of tallow candles fixed in sconces against the
surrounding walls, the scene-shifters were busy moving drop-scenes,
back cloths and wings, and paid no heed to the two men who strolled
slowly up and down silently, each wrapped in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Armand walked with his hands buried in his breeches pockets, his
head bent forward on his chest; but every now and again he threw
quick, apprehensive glances round him whenever a firm step echoed
along the empty stage or a voice rang clearly through the now
deserted theatre.</p>

<p>"Are we wise to wait here?" he asked, speaking to himself rather
than to his companion.</p>

<p>He was not anxious about his own safety; but the words of de
Batz had impressed themselves upon his mind: "Héron and his spies
we have always with us."</p>

<p>From the green-room a separate <i>foyer</i> and exit led
directly out into the street. Gradually the sound of many voices,
the loud laughter and occasional snatches of song which for the
past half-hour had proceeded from that part of the house, became
more subdued and more rare. One by one the friends of the artists
were leaving the theatre, after having paid the usual banal
compliments to those whom they favoured, or presented the
accustomed offering of flowers to the brightest star of the
night.</p>

<p>The actors were the first to retire, then the older actresses,
the ones who could no longer command a court of admirers round
them. They all filed out of the green-room and crossed the stage to
where, at the back, a narrow, rickety wooden stairs led to their
so-called dressing-rooms&mdash;tiny, dark cubicles, ill-lighted,
unventilated, where some half-dozen of the lesser stars tumbled
over one another while removing wigs and grease-paint.</p>

<p>Armand and de Batz watched this exodus, both with equal
impatience. Mlle. Lange was the last to leave the green-room. For
some time, since the crowd had become thinner round her, Armand had
contrived to catch glimpses of her slight, elegant figure. A short
passage led from the stage to the green-room door, which was wide
open, and at the corner of this passage the young man had paused
from time to time in his walk, gazing with earnest admiration at
the dainty outline of the young girl's head, with its wig of
powdered curls that seemed scarcely whiter than the creamy
brilliance of her skin.</p>

<p>De Batz did not watch Mlle. Lange beyond casting impatient looks
in the direction of the crowd that prevented her leaving the
green-room. He did watch Armand, however&mdash;noted his eager
look, his brisk and alert movements, the obvious glances of
admiration which he cast in the direction of the young actress, and
this seemed to afford him a considerable amount of contentment.</p>

<p>The best part of an hour had gone by since the fall of the
curtain before Mlle. Lange finally dismissed her many admirers, and
de Batz had the satisfaction of seeing her running down the
passage, turning back occasionally in order to bid gay
"good-nights" to the loiterers who were loath to part from her. She
was a child in all her movements, quite unconscious of self or of
her own charms, but frankly delighted with her success. She was
still dressed in the ridiculous hoops and panniers pertaining to
her part, and the powdered peruke hid the charm of her own hair;
the costume gave a certain stilted air to her unaffected
personality, which, by this very sense of contrast, was essentially
fascinating.</p>

<p>In her arms she held a huge sheaf of sweet-scented narcissi, the
spoils of some favoured spot far away in the South. Armand thought
that never in his life had he seen anything so winsome or so
charming.</p>

<p>Having at last said the positively final adieu, Mlle. Lange with
a happy little sigh turned to run down the passage.</p>

<p>She came face to face with Armand, and gave a sudden little gasp
of terror. It was not good these days to come on any loiterer
unawares.</p>

<p>But already de Batz had quickly joined his friend, and his
smooth, pleasant voice, and podgy, beringed hand extended towards
Mlle. Lange, were sufficient to reassure her.</p>

<p>"You were so surrounded in the green-room, mademoiselle," he
said courteously, "I did not venture to press in among the crowd of
your admirers. Yet I had the great wish to present my respectful
congratulations in person."</p>

<p>"<i>Ah! c'est ce cher de Batz!</i>" exclaimed mademoiselle
gaily, in that exquisitely rippling voice of hers. "And where in
the world do you spring from, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Hush-sh-sh!" he whispered, holding her small bemittened hand in
his, and putting one finger to his lips with an urgent entreaty for
discretion; "not my name, I beg of you, fair one."</p>

<p>"Bah!" she retorted lightly, even though her full lips trembled
now as she spoke and belied her very words. "You need have no fear
whilst you are in this part of the house. It is an understood thing
that the Committee of General Security does not send its spies
behind the curtain of a theatre. Why, if all of us actors and
actresses were sent to the guillotine there would be no play on the
morrow. Artistes are not replaceable in a few hours; those that are
in existence must perforce be spared, or the citizens who govern us
now would not know where to spend their evenings."</p>

<p>But though she spoke so airily and with her accustomed gaiety,
it was easily perceived that even on this childish mind the dangers
which beset every one these days had already imprinted their mark
of suspicion and of caution.</p>

<p>"Come into my dressing-room," she said. "I must not tarry here
any longer, for they will be putting out the lights. But I have a
room to myself, and we can talk there quite agreeably."</p>

<p>She led the way across the stage towards the wooden stairs.
Armand, who during this brief colloquy between his friend and the
young girl had kept discreetly in the background, felt undecided
what to do. But at a peremptory sign from de Batz he, too, turned
in the wake of the gay little lady, who ran swiftly up the rickety
steps, humming snatches of popular songs the while, and not turning
to see if indeed the two men were following her.</p>

<p>She had the sheaf of narcissi still in her arms, and the door of
her tiny dressing-room being open, she ran straight in and threw
the flowers down in a confused, sweet-scented mass upon the small
table that stood at one end of the room, littered with pots and
bottles, letters, mirrors, powder-puffs, silk stockings, and
cambric handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Then she turned and faced the two men, a merry look of
unalterable gaiety dancing in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Shut the door, <i>mon ami</i>," she said to de Batz, "and after
that sit down where you can, so long as it is not on my most
precious pot of unguent or a box of costliest powder."</p>

<p>While de Batz did as he was told, she turned to Armand and said
with a pretty tone of interrogation in her melodious voice:</p>

<p>"Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"St. Just, at your service, mademoiselle," said Armand, bowing
very low in the most approved style obtaining at the English
Court.</p>

<p>"St. Just?" she repeated, a look of puzzlement in her brown
eyes. "Surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A kinsman of citizen St. Just, whom no doubt you know,
mademoiselle," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"My friend Armand St. Just," interposed de Batz, "is practically
a new-comer in Paris. He lives in England habitually."</p>

<p>"In England?" she exclaimed. "Oh! do tell me all about England.
I would love to go there. Perhaps I may have to go some day. Oh! do
sit down, de Batz," she continued, talking rather volubly, even as
a delicate blush heightened the colour in her cheeks under the look
of obvious admiration from Armand St. Just's expressive eyes.</p>

<p>She swept a handful of delicate cambric and silk from off a
chair, making room for de Batz' portly figure. Then she sat upon
the sofa, and with an inviting gesture and a call from the eyes she
bade Armand sit down next to her. She leaned back against the
cushions, and the table being close by, she stretched out a hand
and once more took up the bunch of narcissi, and while she talked
to Armand she held the snow-white blooms quite close to her
face&mdash;so close, in fact, that he could not see her mouth and
chin, only her dark eyes shone across at him over the heads of the
blossoms.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about England," she reiterated, settling herself
down among the cushions like a spoilt child who is about to listen
to an oft-told favourite story.</p>

<p>Armand was vexed that de Batz was sitting there. He felt he
could have told this dainty little lady quite a good deal about
England if only his pompous, fat friend would have had the good
sense to go away.</p>

<p>As it was, he felt unusually timid and <i>gauche</i>, not quite
knowing what to say, a fact which seemed to amuse Mlle. Lange not a
little.</p>

<p>"I am very fond of England," he said lamely; "my sister is
married to an Englishman, and I myself have taken up my permanent
residence there."</p>

<p>"Among the society of <i>émigrés?</i>" she queried.</p>

<p>Then, as Armand made no reply, de Batz interposed quickly:</p>

<p>"Oh! you need not fear to admit it, my good Armand; Mademoiselle
Lange, has many friends among the émigrés&mdash;have you not,
mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she replied lightly; "I have friends
everywhere. Their political views have nothing to do with me.
Artistes, I think, should have naught to do with politics. You see,
citizen St. Just, I never inquired of you what were your views.
Your name and kinship would proclaim you a partisan of citizen
Robespierre, yet I find you in the company of M. de Batz; and you
tell me that you live in England."</p>

<p>"He is no partisan of citizen Robespierre," again interposed de
Batz; "in fact, mademoiselle, I may safely tell you, I think, that
my friend has but one ideal on this earth, whom he has set up in a
shrine, and whom he worships with all the ardour of a Christian for
his God."</p>

<p>"How romantic!" she said, and she looked straight at Armand.
"Tell me, monsieur, is your ideal a woman or a man?"</p>

<p>His look answered her, even before he boldly spoke the two
words:</p>

<p>"A woman."</p>

<p>She took a deep draught of sweet, intoxicating scent from the
narcissi, and his gaze once more brought blushes to her cheeks. De
Batz' good-humoured laugh helped her to hide this unwonted access
of confusion.</p>

<p>"That was well turned, friend Armand," he said lightly; "but I
assure you, mademoiselle, that before I brought him here to-night
his ideal was a man."</p>

<p>"A man!" she exclaimed, with a contemptuous little pout. "Who
was it?"</p>

<p>"I know no other name for him but that of a small, insignificant
flower&mdash;the Scarlet Pimpernel," replied de Batz.</p>

<p>"The Scarlet Pimpernel!" she ejaculated, dropping the flowers
suddenly, and gazing on Armand with wide, wondering eyes. "And do
you know him, monsieur?"</p>

<p>He was frowning despite himself, despite the delight which he
felt at sitting so close to this charming little lady, and feeling
that in a measure his presence and his personality interested her.
But he felt irritated with de Batz, and angered at what he
considered the latter's indiscretion. To him the very name of his
leader was almost a sacred one; he was one of those enthusiastic
devotees who only care to name the idol of their dreams with bated
breath, and only in the ears of those who would understand and
sympathise.</p>

<p>Again he felt that if only he could have been alone with
mademoiselle he could have told her all about the Scarlet
Pimpernel, knowing that in her he would find a ready listener, a
helping and a loving heart; but as it was he merely replied tamely
enough:</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle, I do know him."</p>

<p>"You have seen him?" she queried eagerly; "spoken to him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh! do tell me all about him. You know quite a number of us in
France have the greatest possible admiration for your national
hero. We know, of course, that he is an enemy of our
Government&mdash;but, oh! we feel that he is not an enemy of France
because of that. We are a nation of heroes, too, monsieur," she
added with a pretty, proud toss of the head; "we can appreciate
bravery and resource, and we love the mystery that surrounds the
personality of your Scarlet Pimpernel. But since you know him,
monsieur, tell me what is he like?"</p>

<p>Armand was smiling again. He was yielding himself up wholly to
the charm which emanated from this young girl's entire being, from
her gaiety and her unaffectedness, her enthusiasm, and that obvious
artistic temperament which caused her to feel every sensation with
superlative keenness and thoroughness.</p>

<p>"What is he like?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"That, mademoiselle," he replied, "I am not at liberty to tell
you."</p>

<p>"Not at liberty to tell me!" she exclaimed; "but monsieur, if I
command you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At risk of falling forever under the ban of your displeasure,
mademoiselle, I would still remain silent on that subject."</p>

<p>She gazed on him with obvious astonishment. It was quite an
unusual thing for this spoilt darling of an admiring public to be
thus openly thwarted in her whims.</p>

<p>"How tiresome and pedantic!" she said, with a shrug of her
pretty shoulders and a <i>moue</i> of discontent. "And, oh! how
ungallant! You have learnt ugly, English ways, monsieur; for there,
I am told, men hold their womenkind in very scant esteem. There!"
she added, turning with a mock air of hopelessness towards de Batz,
"am I not a most unlucky woman? For the past two years I have used
my best endeavours to catch sight of that interesting Scarlet
Pimpernel; here do I meet monsieur, who actually knows him (so he
says), and he is so ungallant that he even refuses to satisfy the
first cravings of my just curiosity."</p>

<p>"Citizen St. Just will tell you nothing now, mademoiselle,"
rejoined de Batz with his good-humoured laugh; "it is my presence,
I assure you, which is setting a seal upon his lips. He is, believe
me, aching to confide in you, to share in your enthusiasm, and to
see your beautiful eyes glowing in response to his ardour when he
describes to you the exploits of that prince of heroes. <i>En
tête-à-tête</i> one day, you will, I know, worm every secret out of
my discreet friend Armand."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle made no comment on this&mdash;that is to say, no
audible comment&mdash;but she buried the whole of her face for a
few seconds among the flowers, and Armand from amongst those
flowers caught sight of a pair of very bright brown eyes which
shone on him with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>She said nothing more about the Scarlet Pimpernel or about
England just then, but after awhile she began talking of more
indifferent subjects: the state of the weather, the price of food,
the discomforts of her own house, now that the servants had been
put on perfect equality with their masters.</p>

<p>Armand soon gathered that the burning questions of the day, the
horrors of massacres, the raging turmoil of politics, had not
affected her very deeply as yet. She had not troubled her pretty
head very much about the social and humanitarian aspect of the
present seething revolution. She did not really wish to think about
it at all. An artiste to her finger-tips, she was spending her
young life in earnest work, striving to attain perfection in her
art, absorbed in study during the day, and in the expression of
what she had learnt in the evenings.</p>

<p>The terrors of the guillotine affected her a little, but
somewhat vaguely still. She had not realised that any dangers could
assail her whilst she worked for the artistic delectation of the
public.</p>

<p>It was not that she did not understand what went on around her,
but that her artistic temperament and her environment had kept her
aloof from it all. The horrors of the Place de la Révolution made
her shudder, but only in the same way as the tragedies of M. Racine
or of Sophocles which she had studied caused her to shudder, and
she had exactly the same sympathy for poor Queen Marie Antoinette
as she had for Mary Stuart, and shed as many tears for King Louis
as she did for Polyeucte.</p>

<p>Once de Batz mentioned the Dauphin, but mademoiselle put up her
hand quickly and said in a trembling voice, whilst the tears
gathered in her eyes:</p>

<p>"Do not speak of the child to me, de Batz. What can I, a lonely,
hard-working woman, do to help him? I try not to think of him, for
if I did, knowing my own helplessness, I feel that I could hate my
countrymen, and speak my bitter hatred of them across the
footlights; which would be more than foolish," she added naively,
"for it would not help the child, and I should be sent to the
guillotine. But oh sometimes I feel that I would gladly die if only
that poor little child-martyr were restored to those who love him
and given back once more to joy and happiness. But they would not
take my life for his, I am afraid," she concluded, smiling through
her tears. "My life is of no value in comparison with his."</p>

<p>Soon after this she dismissed her two visitors. De Batz, well
content with the result of this evening's entertainment, wore an
urbane, bland smile on his rubicund face. Armand, somewhat serious
and not a little in love, made the hand-kiss with which he took his
leave last as long as he could.</p>

<p>"You will come and see me again, citizen St. Just?" she asked
after that preliminary leave-taking.</p>

<p>"At your service, mademoiselle," he replied with alacrity.</p>

<p>"How long do you stay in Paris?"</p>

<p>"I may be called away at any time."</p>

<p>"Well, then, come to-morrow. I shall be free towards four
o'clock. Square du Roule. You cannot miss the house. Any one there
will tell you where lives citizeness Lange."</p>

<p>"At your service, mademoiselle," he replied.</p>

<p>The words sounded empty and meaningless, but his eyes, as they
took final leave of her, spoke the gratitude and the joy which he
felt.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5. The Temple Prison</h2>

<p>It was close on midnight when the two friends finally parted
company outside the doors of the theatre. The night air struck with
biting keenness against them when they emerged from the stuffy,
overheated building, and both wrapped their caped cloaks tightly
round their shoulders.</p>

<p>Armand&mdash;more than ever now&mdash;was anxious to rid himself
of de Batz. The Gascon's platitudes irritated him beyond the bounds
of forbearance, and he wanted to be alone, so that he might think
over the events of this night, the chief event being a little lady
with an enchanting voice and the most fascinating brown eyes he had
ever seen.</p>

<p>Self-reproach, too, was fighting a fairly even fight with the
excitement that had been called up by that same pair of brown eyes.
Armand for the past four or five hours had acted in direct
opposition to the earnest advice given to him by his chief; he had
renewed one friendship which had been far better left in oblivion,
and he had made an acquaintance which already was leading him along
a path that he felt sure his comrade would disapprove. But the path
was so profusely strewn with scented narcissi that Armand's
sensitive conscience was quickly lulled to rest by the intoxicating
fragrance.</p>

<p>Looking neither to right nor left, he made his way very quickly
up the Rue Richelieu towards the Montmartre quarter, where he
lodged.</p>

<p>De Batz stood and watched him for as long as the dim lights of
the street lamps illumined his slim, soberly-clad figure; then he
turned on his heel and walked off in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>His florid, pock-marked face wore an air of contentment not
altogether unmixed with a kind of spiteful triumph.</p>

<p>"So, my pretty Scarlet Pimpernel," he muttered between his
closed lips, "you wish to meddle in my affairs, to have for
yourself and your friends the credit and glory of snatching the
golden prize from the clutches of these murderous brutes. Well, we
shall see! We shall see which is the wiliest&mdash;the French
ferret or the English fox."</p>

<p>He walked deliberately away from the busy part of the town,
turning his back on the river, stepping out briskly straight before
him, and swinging his gold-beaded cane as he walked.</p>

<p>The streets which he had to traverse were silent and deserted,
save occasionally where a drinking or an eating house had its
swing-doors still invitingly open. From these places, as de Batz
strode rapidly by, came sounds of loud voices, rendered raucous by
outdoor oratory; volleys of oaths hurled irreverently in the midst
of impassioned speeches; interruptions from rowdy audiences that
vied with the speaker in invectives and blasphemies; wordy
war-fares that ended in noisy vituperations; accusations hurled
through the air heavy with tobacco smoke and the fumes of cheap
wines and of raw spirits.</p>

<p>De Batz took no heed of these as he passed, anxious only that
the crowd of eating-house politicians did not, as often was its
wont, turn out <i>pêle-mêle</i> into the street, and settle its
quarrel by the weight of fists. He did not wish to be embroiled in
a street fight, which invariably ended in denunciations and
arrests, and was glad when presently he had left the purlieus of
the Palais Royal behind him, and could strike on his left toward
the lonely Faubourg du Temple.</p>

<p>From the dim distance far away came at intervals the mournful
sound of a roll of muffled drums, half veiled by the intervening
hubbub of the busy night life of the great city. It proceeded from
the Place de la Révolution, where a company of the National Guard
were on night watch round the guillotine. The dull, intermittent
notes of the drum came as a reminder to the free people of France
that the watchdog of a vengeful revolution was alert night and day,
never sleeping, ever wakeful, "beating up game for the guillotine,"
as the new decree framed to-day by the Government of the people had
ordered that it should do.</p>

<p>From time to time now the silence of this lonely street was
broken by a sudden cry of terror, followed by the clash of arms,
the inevitable volley of oaths, the call for help, the final moan
of anguish. They were the ever-recurring brief tragedies which told
of denunciations, of domiciliary search, of sudden arrests, of an
agonising desire for life and for freedom&mdash;for life under
these same horrible conditions of brutality and of servitude, for
freedom to breathe, if only a day or two longer, this air, polluted
by filth and by blood.</p>

<p>De Batz, hardened to these scenes, paid no heed to them. He had
heard it so often, that cry in the night, followed by death-like
silence; it came from comfortable bourgeois houses, from squalid
lodgings, or lonely cul-de-sac, wherever some hunted quarry was run
to earth by the newly-organised spies of the Committee of General
Security.</p>

<p>Five and thirty livres for every head that falls trunkless into
the basket at the foot of the guillotine! Five and thirty pieces of
silver, now as then, the price of innocent blood. Every cry in the
night, every call for help, meant game for the guillotine, and five
and thirty livres in the hands of a Judas.</p>

<p>And de Batz walked on unmoved by what he saw and heard, swinging
his cane and looking satisfied. Now he struck into the Place de la
Victoire, and looked on one of the open-air camps that had recently
been established where men, women, and children were working to
provide arms and accoutrements for the Republican army that was
fighting the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>The people of France were up in arms against tyranny; and on the
open places of their mighty city they were encamped day and night
forging those arms which were destined to make them free, and in
the meantime were bending under a yoke of tyranny more complete,
more grinding and absolute than any that the most despotic kings
had ever dared to inflict.</p>

<p>Here by the light of resin torches, at this late hour of the
night, raw lads were being drilled into soldiers, half-naked under
the cutting blast of the north wind, their knees shaking under
them, their arms and legs blue with cold, their stomachs empty, and
their teeth chattering with fear; women were sewing shirts for the
great improvised army, with eyes straining to see the stitches by
the flickering light of the torches, their throats parched with the
continual inhaling of smoke-laden air; even children, with weak,
clumsy little fingers, were picking rags to be woven into cloth
again&mdash;all, all these slaves were working far into the night,
tired, hungry, and cold, but working unceasingly, as the country
had demanded it: "the people of France in arms against tyranny!"
The people of France had to set to work to make arms, to clothe the
soldiers, the defenders of the people's liberty.</p>

<p>And from this crowd of people&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;there came scarcely a sound, save raucous whispers,
a moan or a sigh quickly suppressed. A grim silence reigned in this
thickly-peopled camp; only the crackling of the torches broke that
silence now and then, or the flapping of canvas in the wintry gale.
They worked on sullen, desperate, and starving, with no hope of
payment save the miserable rations wrung from poor tradespeople or
miserable farmers, as wretched, as oppressed as themselves; no hope
of payment, only fear of punishment, for that was ever present.</p>

<p>The people of France in arms against tyranny were not allowed to
forget that grim taskmaster with the two great hands stretched
upwards, holding the knife which descended mercilessly,
indiscriminately on necks that did not bend willingly to the
task.</p>

<p>A grim look of gratified desire had spread over de Batz' face as
he skirted the open-air camp. Let them toil, let them groan, let
them starve! The more these clouts suffer, the more brutal the heel
that grinds them down, the sooner will the Emperor's money
accomplish its work, the sooner will these wretches be clamoring
for the monarchy, which would mean a rich reward in de Batz'
pockets.</p>

<p>To him everything now was for the best: the tyranny, the
brutality, the massacres. He gloated in the holocausts with as much
satisfaction as did the most bloodthirsty Jacobin in the
Convention. He would with his own hands have wielded the guillotine
that worked too slowly for his ends. Let that end justify the
means, was his motto. What matter if the future King of France
walked up to his throne over steps made of headless corpses and
rendered slippery with the blood of martyrs?</p>

<p>The ground beneath de Batz' feet was hard and white with the
frost. Overhead the pale, wintry moon looked down serene and placid
on this giant city wallowing in an ocean of misery.</p>

<p>There, had been but little snow as yet this year, and the cold
was intense. On his right now the Cimetière des SS. Innocents lay
peaceful and still beneath the wan light of the moon. A thin
covering of snow lay evenly alike on grass mounds and smooth
stones. Here and there a broken cross with chipped arms still held
pathetically outstretched, as if in a final appeal for human love,
bore mute testimony to senseless excesses and spiteful desire for
destruction.</p>

<p>But here within the precincts of the dwelling of the eternal
Master a solemn silence reigned; only the cold north wind shook the
branches of the yew, causing them to send forth a melancholy sigh
into the night, and to shed a shower of tiny crystals of snow like
the frozen tears of the dead.</p>

<p>And round the precincts of the lonely graveyard, and down narrow
streets or open places, the night watchmen went their rounds,
lanthorn in hand, and every five minutes their monotonous call rang
clearly out in the night:</p>

<p>"Sleep, citizens! everything is quiet and at peace!"</p>

<p><br>
We may take it that de Batz did not philosophise over-much on what
went on around him. He had walked swiftly up the Rue St. Martin,
then turning sharply to his right he found himself beneath the
tall, frowning walls of the Temple prison, the grim guardian of so
many secrets, such terrible despair, such unspeakable
tragedies.</p>

<p>Here, too, as in the Place de la Révolution, an intermittent
roll of muffled drums proclaimed the ever-watchful presence of the
National Guard. But with that exception not a sound stirred round
the grim and stately edifice; there were no cries, no calls, no
appeals around its walls. All the crying and wailing was shut in by
the massive stone that told no tales.</p>

<p>Dim and flickering lights shone behind several of the small
windows in the façade of the huge labyrinthine building. Without
any hesitation de Batz turned down the Rue du Temple, and soon
found himself in front of the main gates which gave on the
courtyard beyond. The sentinel challenged him, but he had the
pass-word, and explained that he desired to have speech with
citizen Héron.</p>

<p>With a surly gesture the guard pointed to the heavy bell-pull up
against the gate, and de Batz pulled it with all his might. The
long clang of the brazen bell echoed and re-echoed round the solid
stone walls. Anon a tiny judas in the gate was cautiously pushed
open, and a peremptory voice once again challenged the midnight
intruder.</p>

<p>De Batz, more peremptorily this time, asked for citizen Héron,
with whom he had immediate and important business, and a glimmer of
a piece of silver which he held up close to the judas secured him
the necessary admittance.</p>

<p>The massive gates slowly swung open on their creaking hinges,
and as de Batz passed beneath the archway they closed again behind
him.</p>

<p>The concierge's lodge was immediately on his left. Again he was
challenged, and again gave the pass-word. But his face was
apparently known here, for no serious hindrance to proceed was put
in his way.</p>

<p>A man, whose wide, lean frame was but ill-covered by a
threadbare coat and ragged breeches, and with soleless shoes on his
feet, was told off to direct the citoyen to citizen Héron's rooms.
The man walked slowly along with bent knees and arched spine, and
shuffled his feet as he walked; the bunch of keys which he carried
rattled ominously in his long, grimy hands; the passages were badly
lighted, and he also carried a lanthorn to guide himself on the
way.</p>

<p>Closely followed by de Batz, he soon turned into the central
corridor, which is open to the sky above, and was spectrally alight
now with flag-stones and walls gleaming beneath the silvery sheen
of the moon, and throwing back the fantastic elongated shadows of
the two men as they walked.</p>

<p>On the left, heavily barred windows gave on the corridor, as did
here and there the massive oaken doors, with their gigantic hinges
and bolts, on the steps of which squatted groups of soldiers
wrapped in their cloaks, with wild, suspicious eyes beneath their
capotes, peering at the midnight visitor as he passed.</p>

<p>There was no thought of silence here. The very walls seemed
alive with sounds, groans and tears, loud wails and murmured
prayers; they exuded from the stones and trembled on the
frost-laden air.</p>

<p>Occasionally at one of the windows a pair of white hands would
appear, grasping the heavy iron bar, trying to shake it in its
socket, and mayhap, above the hands, the dim vision of a haggard
face, a man's or a woman's, trying to get a glimpse of the outside
world, a final look at the sky, before the last journey to the
place of death to-morrow. Then one of the soldiers, with a loud,
angry oath, would struggle to his feet, and with the butt-end of
his gun strike at the thin, wan fingers till their hold on the iron
bar relaxed, and the pallid face beyond would sink back into the
darkness with a desperate cry of pain.</p>

<p>A quick, impatient sigh escaped de Batz' lips. He had skirted
the wide courtyard in the wake of his guide, and from where he was
he could see the great central tower, with its tiny windows lighted
from within, the grim walls behind which the descendant of the
world's conquerors, the bearer of the proudest name in Europe, and
wearer of its most ancient crown, had spent the last days of his
brilliant life in abject shame, sorrow, and degradation. The memory
had swiftly surged up before him of that night when he all but
rescued King Louis and his family from this same miserable prison:
the guard had been bribed, the keeper corrupted, everything had
been prepared, save the reckoning with the one irresponsible
factor&mdash;chance!</p>

<p>He had failed then and had tried again, and again had failed; a
fortune had been his reward if he had succeeded. He had failed, but
even now, when his footsteps echoed along the flagged courtyard,
over which an unfortunate King and Queen had walked on their way to
their last ignominious Calvary, he hugged himself with the
satisfying thought that where he had failed at least no one else
had succeeded.</p>

<p>Whether that meddlesome English adventurer, who called himself
the Scarlet Pimpernel, had planned the rescue of King Louis or of
Queen Marie Antoinette at any time or not&mdash;that he did not
know; but on one point at least he was more than ever determined,
and that was that no power on earth should snatch from him the
golden prize offered by Austria for the rescue of the little
Dauphin.</p>

<p>"I would sooner see the child perish, if I cannot save him
myself," was the burning thought in this man's tortuous brain. "And
let that accursed Englishman look to himself and to his d----d
confederates," he added, muttering a fierce oath beneath his
breath.</p>

<p>A winding, narrow stone stair, another length or two of
corridor, and his guide's shuffling footsteps paused beside a low
iron-studded door let into the solid stone. De Batz dismissed his
ill-clothed guide and pulled the iron bell-handle which hung beside
the door.</p>

<p>The bell gave forth a dull and broken clang, which seemed like
an echo of the wails of sorrow that peopled the huge building with
their weird and monotonous sounds.</p>

<p>De Batz&mdash;a thoroughly unimaginative person&mdash;waited
patiently beside the door until it was opened from within, and he
was confronted by a tall stooping figure, wearing a greasy coat of
snuff-brown cloth, and holding high above his head a lanthorn that
threw its feeble light on de Batz' jovial face and form.</p>

<p>"It is even I, citizen Héron," he said, breaking in swiftly on
the other's ejaculation of astonishment, which threatened to send
his name echoing the whole length of corridors and passages, until
round every corner of the labyrinthine house of sorrow the murmur
would be borne on the wings of the cold night breeze: "Citizen
Héron is in parley with <i>ci-devant</i> Baron de Batz!"</p>

<p>A fact which would have been equally unpleasant for both these
worthies.</p>

<p>"Enter!" said Héron curtly.</p>

<p>He banged the heavy door to behind his visitor; and de Batz, who
seemed to know his way about the place, walked straight across the
narrow landing to where a smaller door stood invitingly open.</p>

<p>He stepped boldly in, the while citizen Héron put the lanthorn
down on the floor of the couloir, and then followed his nocturnal
visitor into the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6. The Committee's
Agent</h2>

<p>It was a narrow, ill-ventilated place, with but one barred
window that gave on the courtyard. An evil-smelling lamp hung by a
chain from the grimy ceiling, and in a corner of the room a tiny
iron stove shed more unpleasant vapour than warm glow around.</p>

<p>There was but little furniture: two or three chairs, a table
which was littered with papers, and a corner-cupboard&mdash;the
open doors of which revealed a miscellaneous
collection&mdash;bundles of papers, a tin saucepan, a piece of cold
sausage, and a couple of pistols. The fumes of stale tobacco-smoke
hovered in the air, and mingled most unpleasantly with those of the
lamp above, and of the mildew that penetrated through the walls
just below the roof.</p>

<p>Héron pointed to one of the chairs, and then sat down on the
other, close to the table, on which he rested his elbow. He picked
up a short-stemmed pipe, which he had evidently laid aside at the
sound of the bell, and having taken several deliberate long-drawn
puffs from it, he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Well, what is it now?"</p>

<p>In the meanwhile de Batz had made himself as much at home in
this uncomfortable room as he possibly could. He had deposited his
hat and cloak on one rickety rush-bottomed chair, and drawn another
close to the fire. He sat down with one leg crossed over the other,
his podgy be-ringed hand wandering with loving gentleness down the
length of his shapely calf.</p>

<p>He was nothing if not complacent, and his complacency seemed
highly to irritate his friend Héron.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" reiterated the latter, drawing his visitor's
attention roughly to himself by banging his fist on the table. "Out
with it! What do you want? Why have you come at this hour of the
night to compromise me, I suppose&mdash;bring your own d----d neck
and mine into the same noose&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Easy, easy, my friend," responded de Batz imperturbably; "waste
not so much time in idle talk. Why do I usually come to see you?
Surely you have had no cause to complain hitherto of the
unprofitableness of my visits to you?"</p>

<p>"They will have to be still more profitable to me in the
future," growled the other across the table. "I have more power
now."</p>

<p>"I know you have," said de Batz suavely. "The new decree? What?
You may denounce whom you please, search whom you please, arrest
whom you please, and send whom you please to the Supreme Tribunal
without giving them the slightest chance of escape."</p>

<p>"Is it in order to tell me all this that you have come to see me
at this hour of the night?" queried Héron with a sneer.</p>

<p>"No; I came at this hour of the night because I surmised that in
the future you and your hell-hounds would be so busy all day
'beating up game for the guillotine' that the only time you would
have at the disposal of your friends would be the late hours of the
night. I saw you at the theatre a couple of hours ago, friend
Héron; I didn't think to find you yet abed."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Rather," retorted de Batz blandly, "shall we say, what do
<i>you</i> want, citizen Héron?"</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"For my continued immunity at the hands of yourself and your
pack?"</p>

<p>Héron pushed his chair brusquely aside and strode across the
narrow room deliberately facing the portly figure of de Batz, who
with head slightly inclined on one side, his small eyes narrowed
till they appeared mere slits in his pockmarked face, was steadily
and quite placidly contemplating this inhuman monster who had this
very day been given uncontrolled power over hundreds of thousands
of human lives.</p>

<p>Héron was one of those tall men who look mean in spite of their
height. His head was small and narrow, and his hair, which was
sparse and lank, fell in untidy strands across his forehead. He
stooped slightly from the neck, and his chest, though wide, was
hollow between the shoulders. But his legs were big and bony,
slightly bent at the knees, like those of an ill-conditioned
horse.</p>

<p>The face was thin and the cheeks sunken; the eyes, very large
and prominent, had a look in them of cold and ferocious cruelty, a
look which contrasted strangely with the weakness and petty greed
apparent in the mouth, which was flabby, with full, very red lips,
and chin that sloped away to the long thin neck.</p>

<p>Even at this moment as he gazed on de Batz the greed and the
cruelty in him were fighting one of those battles the issue of
which is always uncertain in men of his stamp.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said slowly, "that I am prepared to treat
with you any longer. You are an intolerable bit of vermin that has
annoyed the Committee of General Security for over two years now.
It would be excessively pleasant to crush you once and for all, as
one would a buzzing fly."</p>

<p>"Pleasant, perhaps, but immeasurably foolish," rejoined de Batz
coolly; "you would only get thirty-five livres for my head, and I
offer you ten times that amount for the self-same commodity."</p>

<p>"I know, I know; but the whole thing has become too
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Why? I am very modest. I don't ask a great deal. Let your
hounds keep off my scent."</p>

<p>"You have too many d----d confederates."</p>

<p>"Oh! Never mind about the others. I am not bargaining about
them. Let them look after themselves."</p>

<p>"Every time we get a batch of them, one or the other denounces
you."</p>

<p>"Under torture, I know," rejoined de Batz placidly, holding his
podgy hands to the warm glow of the fire. "For you have started
torture in your house of Justice now, eh, friend Héron? You and
your friend the Public Prosecutor have gone the whole gamut of
devilry&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" retorted the other gruffly.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing! I was even proposing to pay you three
thousand five hundred livres for the privilege of taking no further
interest in what goes on inside this prison!"</p>

<p>"Three thousand five hundred!" ejaculated Héron involuntarily,
and this time even his eyes lost their cruelty; they joined issue
with the mouth in an expression of hungering avarice.</p>

<p>"Two little zeros added to the thirty-five, which is all you
would get for handing me over to your accursed Tribunal," said de
Batz, and, as if thoughtlessly, his hand wandered to the inner
pocket of his coat, and a slight rustle as of thin crisp paper
brought drops of moisture to the lips of Héron.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone for three weeks and the money is yours,"
concluded de Batz pleasantly.</p>

<p>There was silence in the room now. Through the narrow barred
window the steely rays of the moon fought with the dim yellow light
of the oil lamp, and lit up the pale face of the Committee's agent
with its lines of cruelty in sharp conflict with those of
greed.</p>

<p>"Well! is it a bargain?" asked de Batz at last in his usual
smooth, oily voice, as he half drew from out his pocket that
tempting little bundle of crisp printed paper. "You have only to
give me the usual receipt for the money and it is yours."</p>

<p>Héron gave a vicious snarl.</p>

<p>"It is dangerous, I tell you. That receipt, if it falls into
some cursed meddler's hands, would send me straight to the
guillotine."</p>

<p>"The receipt could only fall into alien hands," rejoined de Batz
blandly, "if I happened to be arrested, and even in that case they
could but fall into those of the chief agent of the Committee of
General Security, and he hath name Héron. You must take some risks,
my friend. I take them too. We are each in the other's hands. The
bargain is quite fair."</p>

<p>For a moment or two longer Héron appeared to be hesitating
whilst de Batz watched him with keen intentness. He had no doubt
himself as to the issue. He had tried most of these patriots in his
own golden crucible, and had weighed their patriotism against
Austrian money, and had never found the latter wanting.</p>

<p>He had not been here to-night if he were not quite sure. This
inveterate conspirator in the Royalist cause never took personal
risks. He looked on Héron now, smiling to himself the while with
perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Committee's agent with sudden decision,
"I'll take the money. But on one condition."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That you leave little Capet alone."</p>

<p>"The Dauphin!"</p>

<p>"Call him what you like," said Héron, taking a step nearer to de
Batz, and from his great height glowering down in fierce hatred and
rage upon his accomplice; "call the young devil what you like, but
leave us to deal with him."</p>

<p>"To kill him, you mean? Well, how can I prevent it, my
friend?"</p>

<p>"You and your like are always plotting to get him out of here. I
won't have it. I tell you I won't have it. If the brat disappears I
am a dead man. Robespierre and his gang have told me as much. So
you leave him alone, or I'll not raise a finger to help you, but
will lay my own hands on your accursed neck."</p>

<p>He looked so ferocious and so merciless then, that despite
himself, the selfish adventurer, the careless self-seeking
intriguer, shuddered with a quick wave of unreasoning terror. He
turned away from Héron's piercing gaze, the gaze of a hyena whose
prey is being snatched from beneath its nails. For a moment he
stared thoughtfully into the fire.</p>

<p>He heard the other man's heavy footsteps cross and re-cross the
narrow room, and was conscious of the long curved shadow creeping
up the mildewed wall or retreating down upon the carpetless
floor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without any warning he felt a grip upon his shoulder.
He gave a start and almost uttered a cry of alarm which caused
Héron to laugh. The Committee's agent was vastly amused at his
friend's obvious access of fear. There was nothing that he liked
better than that he should inspire dread in the hearts of all those
with whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>"I am just going on my usual nocturnal round," he said abruptly.
"Come with me, citizen de Batz."</p>

<p>A certain grim humour was apparent in his face as he proffered
this invitation, which sounded like a rough command. As de Batz
seemed to hesitate he nodded peremptorily to him to follow. Already
he had gone into the hall and picked up his lanthorn. From beneath
his waistcoat he drew forth a bunch of keys, which he rattled
impatiently, calling to his friend to come.</p>

<p>"Come, citizen," he said roughly. "I wish to show you the one
treasure in this house which your d----d fingers must not
touch."</p>

<p>Mechanically de Batz rose at last. He tried to be master of the
terror which was invading his very bones. He would not own to
himself even that he was afraid, and almost audibly he kept
murmuring to himself that he had no cause for fear.</p>

<p>Héron would never touch him. The spy's avarice, his greed of
money were a perfect safeguard for any man who had the control of
millions, and Héron knew, of course, that he could make of this
inveterate plotter a comfortable source of revenue for himself.
Three weeks would soon be over, and fresh bargains could be made
time and again, while de Batz was alive and free.</p>

<p>Héron was still waiting at the door, even whilst de Batz
wondered what this nocturnal visitation would reveal to him of
atrocity and of outrage. He made a final effort to master his
nervousness, wrapped his cloak tightly around him, and followed his
host out of the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7. The Most Precious Life In
Europe</h2>

<p>Once more he was being led through the interminable corridors of
the gigantic building. Once more from the narrow, barred windows
close by him he heard the heart-breaking sighs, the moans, the
curses which spoke of tragedies that he could only guess.</p>

<p>Héron was walking on ahead of him, preceding him by some fifty
mètres or so, his long legs covering the distances more rapidly
than de Batz could follow them. The latter knew his way well about
the old prison. Few men in Paris possessed that accurate knowledge
of its intricate passages and its network of cells and halls which
de Batz had acquired after close and persevering study.</p>

<p>He himself could have led Héron to the doors of the tower where
the little Dauphin was being kept imprisoned, but unfortunately he
did not possess the keys that would open all the doors which led to
it. There were sentinels at every gate, groups of soldiers at each
end of every corridor, the great&mdash;now empty&mdash;courtyards,
thronged with prisoners in the daytime, were alive with soldiery
even now. Some walked up and down with fixed bayonet on shoulder,
others sat in groups on the stone copings or squatted on the
ground, smoking or playing cards, but all of them were alert and
watchful.</p>

<p>Héron was recognised everywhere the moment he appeared, and
though in these days of equality no one presented arms,
nevertheless every guard stood aside to let him pass, or when
necessary opened a gate for the powerful chief agent of the
Committee of General Security.</p>

<p>Indeed, de Batz had no keys such as these to open the way for
him to the presence of the martyred little King.</p>

<p>Thus the two men wended their way on in silence, one preceding
the other. De Batz walked leisurely, thought-fully, taking stock of
everything he saw&mdash;the gates, the barriers, the positions of
sentinels and warders, of everything in fact that might prove a
help or a hindrance presently, when the great enterprise would be
hazarded. At last&mdash;still in the wake of Héron&mdash;he found
himself once more behind the main entrance gate, underneath the
archway on which gave the <i>guichet</i> of the concierge.</p>

<p>Here, too, there seemed to be an unnecessary number of soldiers:
two were doing sentinel outside the <i>guichet</i>, but there were
others in a file against the wall.</p>

<p>Héron rapped with his keys against the door of the concierge's
lodge, then, as it was not immediately opened from within, he
pushed it open with his foot.</p>

<p>"The concierge?" he queried peremptorily.</p>

<p>From a corner of the small panelled room there came a grunt and
a reply:</p>

<p>"Gone to bed, <i>quoi!</i>"</p>

<p>The man who previously had guided de Batz to Héron's door slowly
struggled to his feet. He had been squatting somewhere in the
gloom, and had been roused by Héron's rough command. He slouched
forward now still carrying a boot in one hand and a blacking brush
in the other.</p>

<p>"Take this lanthorn, then," said the chief agent with a snarl
directed at the sleeping concierge, "and come along. Why are you
still here?" he added, as if in after-thought.</p>

<p>"The citizen concierge was not satisfied with the way I had done
his boots," muttered the man, with an evil leer as he spat
contemptuously on the floor; "an aristo, <i>quoi?</i> A hell of a
place this...twenty cells to sweep out every day...and boots to
clean for every aristo of a concierge or warder who demands it...Is
that work for a free born patriot, I ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you are not satisfied, citoyen Dupont," retorted Héron
dryly, "you may go when you like, you know there are plenty of
others ready to do your work..."</p>

<p>"Nineteen hours a day, and nineteen sous by way of payment...I
have had fourteen days of this convict work..."</p>

<p>He continued to mutter under his breath, whilst Héron, paying no
further heed to him, turned abruptly towards a group of soldiers
stationed outside.</p>

<p>"<i>En avant</i>, corporal!" he said; "bring four men with
you...we go up to the tower."</p>

<p>The small procession was formed. On ahead the lanthorn-bearer,
with arched spine and shaking knees, dragging shuffling footsteps
along the corridor, then the corporal with two of his soldiers,
then Héron closely followed by de Batz, and finally two more
soldiers bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Héron had given the bunch of keys to the man Dupont. The latter,
on ahead, holding the lanthorn aloft, opened one gate after
another. At each gate he waited for the little procession to file
through, then he re-locked the gate and passed on.</p>

<p>Up two or three flights of winding stairs set in the solid
stone, and the final heavy door was reached.</p>

<p>De Batz was meditating. Héron's precautions for the
safe-guarding of the most precious life in Europe were more
complete than he had anticipated. What lavish liberality would be
required! what superhuman ingenuity and boundless courage in order
to break down all the barriers that had been set up round that
young life that flickered inside this grim tower!</p>

<p>Of these three requisites the corpulent, complacent intriguer
possessed only the first in a considerable degree. He could be
exceedingly liberal with the foreign money which he had at his
disposal. As for courage and ingenuity, he believed that he
possessed both, but these qualities had not served him in very good
stead in the attempts which he had made at different times to
rescue the unfortunate members of the Royal Family from prison. His
overwhelming egotism would not admit for a moment that in ingenuity
and pluck the Scarlet Pimpernel and his English followers could
outdo him, but he did wish to make quite sure that they would not
interfere with him in the highly remunerative work of saving the
Dauphin.</p>

<p>Héron's impatient call roused him from these meditations. The
little party had come to a halt outside a massive iron-studded
door.</p>

<p>At a sign from the chief agent the soldiers stood at attention.
He then called de Batz and the lanthorn-bearer to him.</p>

<p>He took a key from his breeches pocket, and with his own hand
unlocked the massive door. He curtly ordered the lanthorn-bearer
and de Batz to go through, then he himself went in, and finally
once more re-locked the door behind him, the soldiers remaining on
guard on the landing outside.</p>

<p>Now the three men were standing in a square antechamber, dank
and dark, devoid of furniture save for a large cupboard that filled
the whole of one wall; the others, mildewed and stained, were
covered with a greyish paper, which here and there hung away in
strips.</p>

<p>Héron crossed this ante-chamber, and with his knuckles rapped
against a small door opposite.</p>

<p>"<i>Holà!</i>" he shouted, "Simon, <i>mon vieux, tu es
là?</i>"</p>

<p>From the inner room came the sound of voices, a man's and a
woman's, and now, as if in response to Héron's call, the shrill
tones of a child. There was some shuffling, too, of footsteps, and
some pushing about of furniture, then the door was opened, and a
gruff voice invited the belated visitors to enter.</p>

<p>The atmosphere in this further room was so thick that at first
de Batz was only conscious of the evil smells that pervaded it;
smells which were made up of the fumes of tobacco, of burning coke,
of a smoky lamp, and of stale food, and mingling through it all the
pungent odour of raw spirits.</p>

<p>Héron had stepped briskly in, closely followed by de Batz. The
man Dupont with a mutter of satisfaction put down his lanthorn and
curled himself up in a corner of the antechamber. His interest in
the spectacle so favoured by citizen Héron had apparently been
exhausted by constant repetition.</p>

<p>De Batz looked round him with keen curiosity with which disgust
was ready enough to mingle.</p>

<p>The room itself might have been a large one; it was almost
impossible to judge of its size, so crammed was it with heavy and
light furniture of every conceivable shape and type. There was a
monumental wooden bedstead in one corner, a huge sofa covered in
black horsehair in another. A large table stood in the centre of
the room, and there were at least four capacious armchairs round
it. There were wardrobes and cabinets, a diminutive washstand and a
huge pier-glass, there were innumerable boxes and packing-cases,
cane-bottomed chairs and what-nots every-where. The place looked
like a depôt for second-hand furniture.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the litter de Batz at last became conscious
of two people who stood staring at him and at Héron. He saw a man
before him, somewhat fleshy of build, with smooth, mouse-coloured
hair brushed away from a central parting, and ending in a heavy
curl above each ear; the eyes were wide open and pale in colour,
the lips unusually thick and with a marked downward droop. Close
beside him stood a youngish-looking woman, whose unwieldy bulk,
however, and pallid skin revealed the sedentary life and the
ravages of ill-health.</p>

<p>Both appeared to regard Héron with a certain amount of awe, and
de Batz with a vast measure of curiosity.</p>

<p>Suddenly the woman stood aside, and in the far corner of the
room there was displayed to the Gascon Royalist's cold, calculating
gaze the pathetic figure of the uncrowned King of France.</p>

<p>"How is it Capet is not yet in bed?" queried Héron as soon as he
caught sight of the child.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't say his prayers this evening," replied Simon with a
coarse laugh, "and wouldn't drink his medicine. Bah!" he added with
a snarl, "this is a place for dogs and not for human folk."</p>

<p>"If you are not satisfied, <i>mon vieux</i>," retorted Héron
curtly, "you can send in your resignation when you like. There are
plenty who will be glad of the place."</p>

<p>The ex-cobbler gave another surly growl and expectorated on the
floor in the direction where stood the child.</p>

<p>"Little vermin," he said, "he is more trouble than man or woman
can bear."</p>

<p>The boy in the meanwhile seemed to take but little notice of the
vulgar insults put upon him by his guardian. He stood, a quaint,
impassive little figure, more interested apparently in de Batz, who
was a stranger to him, than in the three others whom he knew. De
Batz noted that the child looked well nourished, and that he was
warmly clad in a rough woollen shirt and cloth breeches, with
coarse grey stockings and thick shoes; but he also saw that the
clothes were indescribably filthy, as were the child's hands and
face. The golden curls, among which a young and queenly mother had
once loved to pass her slender perfumed fingers, now hung
bedraggled, greasy, and lank round the little face, from the lines
of which every trace of dignity and of simplicity had long since
been erased.</p>

<p>There was no look of the martyr about this child now, even
though, mayhap, his small back had often smarted under his vulgar
tutor's rough blows; rather did the pale young face wear the air of
sullen indifference, and an abject desire to please, which would
have appeared heart-breaking to any spectator less self-seeking and
egotistic than was this Gascon conspirator.</p>

<p>Madame Simon had called him to her while her man and the citizen
Héron were talking, and the child went readily enough, without any
sign of fear. She took the corner of her coarse dirty apron in her
hand, and wiped the boy's mouth and face with it.</p>

<p>"I can't keep him clean," she said with an apologetic shrug of
the shoulders and a look at de Batz. "There now," she added,
speaking once more to the child, "drink like a good boy, and say
your lesson to please <i>maman</i>, and then you shall go to
bed."</p>

<p>She took a glass from the table, which was filled with a clear
liquid that de Batz at first took to be water, and held it to the
boy's lips. He turned his head away and began to whimper.</p>

<p>"Is the medicine very nasty?" queried de Batz.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> but no, citizen," exclaimed the woman, "it is
good strong eau de vie, the best that can be procured. Capet likes
it really&mdash;don't you, Capet? It makes you happy and cheerful,
and sleep well of nights. Why, you had a glassful yesterday and
enjoyed it. Take it now," she added in a quick whisper, seeing that
Simon and Héron were in close conversation together; "you know it
makes papa angry if you don't have at least half a glass now and
then."</p>

<p>The child wavered for a moment longer, making a quaint little
grimace of distaste. But at last he seemed to make up his mind that
it was wisest to yield over so small a matter, and he took the
glass from Madame Simon.</p>

<p>And thus did de Batz see the descendant of St. Louis quaffing a
glass of raw spirit at the bidding of a rough cobbler's wife, whom
he called by the fond and foolish name sacred to childhood,
<i>maman!</i></p>

<p>Selfish egoist though he was, de Batz turned away in
loathing.</p>

<p>Simon had watched the little scene with obvious satisfaction. He
chuckled audibly when the child drank the spirit, and called
Héron's attention to him, whilst a look of triumph lit up his wide,
pale eyes.</p>

<p>"And now, <i>mon petit</i>," he said jovially, "let the citizen
hear you say your prayers!"</p>

<p>He winked toward de Batz, evidently anticipating a good deal of
enjoyment for the visitor from what was coming. From a heap of
litter in a corner of the room he fetched out a greasy red bonnet
adorned with a tricolour cockade, and a soiled and tattered flag,
which had once been white, and had golden fleur-de-lys embroidered
upon it.</p>

<p>The cap he set on the child's head, and the flag he threw upon
the floor.</p>

<p>"Now, Capet&mdash;your prayers!" he said with another chuckle of
amusement.</p>

<p>All his movements were rough, and his speech almost
ostentatiously coarse. He banged against the furniture as he moved
about the room, kicking a footstool out of the way or knocking over
a chair. De Batz instinctively thought of the perfumed stillness of
the rooms at Versailles, of the army of elegant high-born ladies
who had ministered to the wants of this child, who stood there now
before him, a cap on his yellow hair, and his shoulder held up to
his ear with that gesture of careless indifference peculiar to
children when they are sullen or uncared for.</p>

<p>Obediently, quite mechanically it seemed, the boy trod on the
flag which Henri IV had borne before him at Ivry, and <i>le Roi
Soleil</i> had flaunted in the face of the armies of Europe. The
son of the Bourbons was spitting on their flag, and wiping his
shoes upon its tattered folds. With shrill cracked voice he sang
the Carmagnole, "<i>&Ccedil;a ira! &Ccedil;a ira! les aristos à la
lanterne!</i>" until de Batz himself felt inclined to stop his ears
and to rush from the place in horror.</p>

<p>Louis XVII, whom the hearts of many had proclaimed King of
France by the grace of God, the child of the Bourbons, the eldest
son of the Church, was stepping a vulgar dance over the flag of St.
Louis, which he had been taught to defile. His pale cheeks glowed
as he danced, his eyes shone with the unnatural light kindled in
them by the intoxicating liquor; with one slender hand he waved the
red cap with the tricolour cockade, and shouted "Vive la
République!"</p>

<p>Madame Simon was clapping her hands, looking on the child with
obvious pride, and a kind of rough maternal affection. Simon was
gazing on Héron for approval, and the latter nodded his head,
murmuring words of encouragement and of praise.</p>

<p>"Thy catechism now, Capet&mdash;thy catechism," shouted Simon in
a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>The boy stood at attention, cap on head, hands on his hips, legs
wide apart, and feet firmly planted on the fleur-de-lys, the glory
of his forefathers.</p>

<p>"Thy name?" queried Simon.</p>

<p>"Louis Capet," replied the child in a clear, high-pitched
voice.</p>

<p>"What art thou?"</p>

<p>"A citizen of the Republic of France."</p>

<p>"What was thy father?"</p>

<p>"Louis Capet, <i>ci-devant</i> king, a tyrant who perished by
the will of the people!"</p>

<p>"What was thy mother?"</p>

<p>"A ----"</p>

<p>De Batz involuntarily uttered a cry of horror. Whatever the
man's private character was, he had been born a gentleman, and his
every instinct revolted against what he saw and heard. The scene
had positively sickened him. He turned precipitately towards the
door.</p>

<p>"How now, citizen?" queried the Committee's agent with a sneer.
"Are you not satisfied with what you see?"</p>

<p>"Mayhap the citizen would like to see Capet sitting in a golden
chair," interposed Simon the cobbler with a sneer, "and me and my
wife kneeling and kissing his hand&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the heat of the room," stammered de Batz, who was fumbling
with the lock of the door; "my head began to swim."</p>

<p>"Spit on their accursed flag, then, like a good patriot, like
Capet," retorted Simon gruffly. "Here, Capet, my son," he added,
pulling the boy by the arm with a rough gesture, "get thee to bed;
thou art quite drunk enough to satisfy any good Republican."</p>

<p>By way of a caress he tweaked the boy's ear and gave him a prod
in the back with his bent knee. He was not wilfully unkind, for
just now he was not angry with the lad; rather was he vastly amused
with the effect Capet's prayer and Capet's recital of his catechism
had had on the visitor.</p>

<p>As to the lad, the intensity of excitement in him was
immediately followed by an overwhelming desire for sleep. Without
any preliminary of undressing or of washing, he tumbled, just as he
was, on to the sofa. Madame Simon, with quite pleasing solicitude,
arranged a pillow under his head, and the very next moment the
child was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"'Tis well, citoyen Simon," said Héron in his turn, going
towards the door. "I'll report favourably on you to the Committee
of Public Security. As for the citoyenne, she had best be more
careful," he added, turning to the woman Simon with a snarl on his
evil face. "There was no cause to arrange a pillow under the head
of that vermin's spawn. Many good patriots have no pillows to put
under their heads. Take that pillow away; and I don't like the
shoes on the brat's feet; sabots are quite good enough."</p>

<p>Citoyenne Simon made no reply. Some sort of retort had
apparently hovered on her lips, but had been checked, even before
it was uttered, by a peremptory look from her husband. Simon the
cobbler, snarling in speech but obsequious in manner, prepared to
accompany the citizen agent to the door.</p>

<p>De Batz was taking a last look at the sleeping child; the
uncrowned King of France was wrapped in a drunken sleep, with the
last spoken insult upon his dead mother still hovering on his
childish lips.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8. Arcades Ambo</h2>

<p>"That is the way we conduct our affairs, citizen," said Héron
gruffly, as he once more led his guest back into his office.</p>

<p>It was his turn to be complacent now. De Batz, for once in his
life cowed by what he had seen, still wore a look of horror and
disgust upon his florid face.</p>

<p>"What devils you all are!" he said at last.</p>

<p>"We are good patriots," retorted Héron, "and the tyrant's spawn
leads but the life that hundreds of thousands of children led
whilst his father oppressed the people. Nay! what am I saying? He
leads a far better, far happier life. He gets plenty to eat and
plenty of warm clothes. Thousands of innocent children, who have
not the crimes of a despot father upon their conscience, have to
starve whilst he grows fat."</p>

<p>The leer in his face was so evil that once more de Batz felt
that eerie feeling of terror creeping into his bones. Here were
cruelty and bloodthirsty ferocity personified to their utmost
extent. At thought of the Bourbons, or of all those whom he
considered had been in the past the oppressors of the people, Héron
was nothing but a wild and ravenous beast, hungering for revenge,
longing to bury his talons and his fangs into the body of those
whose heels had once pressed on his own neck.</p>

<p>And de Batz knew that even with millions or countless money at
his command he could not purchase from this carnivorous brute the
life and liberty of the son of King Louis. No amount of bribery
would accomplish that; it would have to be ingenuity pitted against
animal force, the wiliness of the fox against the power of the
wolf.</p>

<p>Even now Héron was darting savagely suspicious looks upon
him.</p>

<p>"I shall get rid of the Simons," he said; "there's something in
that woman's face which I don't trust. They shall go within the
next few hours, or as soon as I can lay my hands upon a better
patriot than that mealy-mouthed cobbler. And it will be better not
to have a woman about the place. Let me see&mdash;to-day is
Thursday, or else Friday morning. By Sunday I'll get those Simons
out of the place. Methought I saw you ogling that woman," he added,
bringing his bony fist crashing down on the table so that papers,
pen, and inkhorn rattled loudly; "and if I thought that
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>De Batz thought it well at this point to finger once more
nonchalantly the bundle of crisp paper in the pocket of his
coat.</p>

<p>"Only on that one condition," reiterated Héron in a hoarse
voice; "if you try to get at Capet, I'll drag you to the Tribunal
with my own hands."</p>

<p>"Always presuming that you can get me, my friend," murmured de
Batz, who was gradually regaining his accustomed composure.</p>

<p>Already his active mind was busily at work. One or two things
which he had noted in connection with his visit to the Dauphin's
prison had struck him as possibly useful in his schemes. But he was
disappointed that Héron was getting rid of the Simons. The woman
might have been very useful and more easily got at than a man. The
avarice of the French bourgeoise would have proved a promising
factor. But this, of course, would now be out of the question. At
the same time it was not because Héron raved and stormed and
uttered cries like a hyena that he, de Batz, meant to give up an
enterprise which, if successful, would place millions into his own
pocket.</p>

<p>As for that meddling Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel, and his
crack-brained followers, they must be effectually swept out of the
way first of all. De Batz felt that they were the real, the most
likely hindrance to his schemes. He himself would have to go very
cautiously to work, since apparently Héron would not allow him to
purchase immunity for himself in that one matter, and whilst he was
laying his plans with necessary deliberation so as to ensure his
own safety, that accursed Scarlet Pimpernel would mayhap snatch the
golden prize from the Temple prison right under his very nose.</p>

<p>When he thought of that the Gascon Royalist felt just as
vindictive as did the chief agent of the Committee of General
Security.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were coursing through de Batz' head, Héron
had been indulging in a volley of vituperation.</p>

<p>"If that little vermin escapes," he said, "my life will not be
worth an hour's purchase. In twenty-four hours I am a dead man,
thrown to the guillotine like those dogs of aristocrats! You say I
am a night-bird, citizen. I tell you that I do not sleep night or
day thinking of that brat and the means to keep him safely under my
hand. I have never trusted those Simons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not trusted them!" exclaimed de Batz; "surely you could not
find anywhere more inhuman monsters!"</p>

<p>"Inhuman monsters?" snarled Héron. "Bah! they don't do their
business thoroughly; we want the tyrant's spawn to become a true
Republican and a patriot&mdash;aye! to make of him such a one that
even if you and your cursed confederates got him by some hellish
chance, he would be no use to you as a king, a tyrant to set above
the people, to set up in your Versailles, your Louvre, to eat off
golden plates and wear satin clothes. You have seen the brat! By
the time he is a man he should forget how to eat save with his
fingers, and get roaring drunk every night. That's what we
want!&mdash;to make him so that he shall be no use to you, even if
you did get him away; but you shall not! You shall not, not if I
have to strangle him with my own hands."</p>

<p>He picked up his short-stemmed pipe and pulled savagely at it
for awhile. De Batz was meditating.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said after a little while, "you are agitating
yourself quite unnecessarily, and gravely jeopardising your
prospects of getting a comfortable little income through keeping
your fingers off my person. Who said I wanted to meddle with the
child?"</p>

<p>"You had best not," growled Héron.</p>

<p>"Exactly. You have said that before. But do you not think that
you would be far wiser, instead of directing your undivided
attention to my unworthy self, to turn your thoughts a little to
one whom, believe me, you have far greater cause to fear?"</p>

<p>"Who is that?"</p>

<p>"The Englishman."</p>

<p>"You mean the man they call the Scarlet Pimpernel?"</p>

<p>"Himself. Have you not suffered from his activity, friend Héron?
I fancy that citizen Chauvelin and citizen Collot would have quite
a tale to tell about him."</p>

<p>"They ought both to have been guillotined for that blunder last
autumn at Boulogne."</p>

<p>"Take care that the same accusation be not laid at your door
this year, my friend," commented de Batz placidly.</p>

<p>"Bah!"</p>

<p>"The Scarlet Pimpernel is in Paris even now."</p>

<p>"The devil he is!"</p>

<p>"And on what errand, think you?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, and then de Batz continued with
slow and dramatic emphasis:</p>

<p>"That of rescuing your most precious prisoner from the
Temple."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Héron queried savagely.</p>

<p>"I guessed."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I saw a man in the Théâtre National to-day..."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Who is a member of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"D---- him! Where can I find him?"</p>

<p>"Will you sign a receipt for the three thousand five hundred
livres, which I am pining to hand over to you, my friend, and I
will tell you?"</p>

<p>"Where's the money?"</p>

<p>"In my pocket."</p>

<p>Without further words Héron dragged the inkhorn and a sheet of
paper towards him, took up a pen, and wrote a few words rapidly in
a loose, scrawly hand. He strewed sand over the writing, then
handed it across the table to de Batz.</p>

<p>"Will that do?" he asked briefly.</p>

<p>The other was reading the note through carefully.</p>

<p>"I see you only grant me a fortnight," he remarked casually.</p>

<p>"For that amount of money it is sufficient. If you want an
extension you must pay more."</p>

<p>"So be it," assented de Batz coolly, as he folded the paper
across. "On the whole a fortnight's immunity in France these days
is quite a pleasant respite. And I prefer to keep in touch with
you, friend Héron. I'll call on you again this day fortnight."</p>

<p>He took out a letter-case from his pocket. Out of this he drew a
packet of bank-notes, which he laid on the table in front of Héron,
then he placed the receipt carefully into the letter-case, and this
back into his pocket.</p>

<p>Héron in the meanwhile was counting over the banknotes. The
light of ferocity had entirely gone from his eyes; momentarily the
whole expression of the face was one of satisfied greed.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said at last when he had assured himself that the
number of notes was quite correct, and he had transferred the
bundle of crisp papers into an inner pocket of his
coat&mdash;"well, what about your friend?"</p>

<p>"I knew him years ago," rejoined de Batz coolly; "he is a
kinsman of citizen St. Just. I know that he is one of the
confederates of the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"Where does he lodge?"</p>

<p>"That is for you to find out. I saw him at the theatre, and
afterwards in the green-room; he was making himself agreeable to
the citizeness Lange. I heard him ask for leave to call on her
to-morrow at four o'clock. You know where she lodges, of
course!"</p>

<p>He watched Héron while the latter scribbled a few words on a
scrap of paper, then he quietly rose to go. He took up his cloak
and once again wrapped it round his shoulders. There was nothing
more to be said, and he was anxious to go.</p>

<p>The leave-taking between the two men was neither cordial nor
more than barely courteous. De Batz nodded to Héron, who escorted
him to the outside door of his lodging, and there called loudly to
a soldier who was doing sentinel at the further end of the
corridor.</p>

<p>"Show this citizen the way to the <i>guichet</i>," he said
curtly. "Good-night, citizen," he added finally, nodding to de
Batz.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the Gascon once more found himself in the Rue
du Temple between the great outer walls of the prison and the
silent little church and convent of St. Elizabeth. He looked up to
where in the central tower a small grated window lighted from
within showed the place where the last of the Bourbons was being
taught to desecrate the traditions of his race, at the bidding of a
mender of shoes&mdash;a naval officer cashiered for misconduct and
fraud.</p>

<p>Such is human nature in its self-satisfied complacency that de
Batz, calmly ignoring the vile part which he himself had played in
the last quarter of an hour of his interview with the Committee's
agent, found it in him to think of Héron with loathing, and even of
the cobbler Simon with disgust.</p>

<p>Then with a self-righteous sense of duty performed, and an
indifferent shrug of the shoulders, he dismissed Héron from his
mind.</p>

<p>"That meddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel will find his hands over-full
to-morrow, and mayhap will not interfere in my affairs for some
time to come," he mused; "meseems that that will be the first time
that a member of his precious League has come within the clutches
of such unpleasant people as the sleuth-hounds of my friend
Héron!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9. What Love Can Do</h2>

<p>"Yesterday you were unkind and ungallant. How could I smile when
you seemed so stern?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday I was not alone with you. How could I say what lay
next to my heart, when indifferent ears could catch the words that
were meant only for you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur, do they teach you in England how to make pretty
speeches?"</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle, that is an instinct that comes into birth by
the fire of a woman's eyes."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Lange was sitting upon a small sofa of antique
design, with cushions covered in faded silks heaped round her
pretty head. Armand thought that she looked like that carved cameo
which his sister Marguerite possessed.</p>

<p>He himself sat on a low chair at some distance from her. He had
brought her a large bunch of early violets, for he knew that she
was fond of flowers, and these lay upon her lap, against the
opalescent grey of her gown.</p>

<p>She seemed a little nervous and agitated, his obvious admiration
bringing a ready blush to her cheeks.</p>

<p>The room itself appeared to Armand to be a perfect frame for the
charming picture which she presented. The furniture in it was small
and old; tiny tables of antique Vernis-Martin, softly faded
tapestries, a pale-toned Aubusson carpet. Everything mellow and in
a measure pathetic. Mademoiselle Lange, who was an orphan, lived
alone under the duennaship of a middle-aged relative, a penniless
hanger-on of the successful young actress, who acted as her
chaperone, housekeeper, and maid, and kept unseemly or over-bold
gallants at bay.</p>

<p>She told Armand all about her early life, her childhood in the
backshop of Maître Mézière, the jeweller, who was a relative of her
mother's; of her desire for an artistic career, her struggles with
the middle-class prejudices of her relations, her bold defiance of
them, and final independence.</p>

<p>She made no secret of her humble origin, her want of education
in those days; on the contrary, she was proud of what she had
accomplished for herself. She was only twenty years of age, and
already held a leading place in the artistic world of Paris.</p>

<p>Armand listened to her chatter, interested in everything she
said, questioning her with sympathy and discretion. She asked him a
good deal about himself, and about his beautiful sister Marguerite,
who, of course, had been the most brilliant star in that most
brilliant constellation, the Comédie Française. She had never seen
Marguerite St. Just act, but, of course, Paris still rang with her
praises, and all art-lovers regretted that she should have married
and left them to mourn for her.</p>

<p>Thus the conversation drifted naturally back to England.
Mademoiselle professed a vast interest in the citizen's country of
adoption.</p>

<p>"I had always," she said, "thought it an ugly country, with the
noise and bustle of industrial life going on everywhere, and smoke
and fog to cover the landscape and to stunt the trees."</p>

<p>"Then, in future, mademoiselle," he replied, "must you think of
it as one carpeted with verdure, where in the spring the orchard
trees covered with delicate blossom would speak to you of
fairyland, where the dewy grass stretches its velvety surface in
the shadow of ancient monumental oaks, and ivy-covered towers rear
their stately crowns to the sky."</p>

<p>"And the Scarlet Pimpernel? Tell me about him, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle, what can I tell you that you do not already
know? The Scarlet Pimpernel is a man who has devoted his entire
existence to the benefit of suffering mankind. He has but one
thought, and that is for those who need him; he hears but one sound
the cry of the oppressed."</p>

<p>"But they do say, monsieur, that philanthropy plays but a sorry
part in your hero's schemes. They aver that he looks on his own
efforts and the adventures through which he goes only in the light
of sport."</p>

<p>"Like all Englishmen, mademoiselle, the Scarlet Pimpernel is a
little ashamed of sentiment. He would deny its very existence with
his lips, even whilst his noble heart brimmed over with it. Sport?
Well! mayhap the sporting instinct is as keen as that of
charity&mdash;the race for lives, the tussle for the rescue of
human creatures, the throwing of a life on the hazard of a
die."</p>

<p>"They fear him in France, monsieur. He has saved so many whose
death had been decreed by the Committee of Public Safety."</p>

<p>"Please God, he will save many yet."</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur, the poor little boy in the Temple prison!"</p>

<p>"He has your sympathy, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Of every right-minded woman in France, monsieur. Oh!" she added
with a pretty gesture of enthusiasm, clasping her hands together,
and looking at Armand with large eyes filled with tears, "if your
noble Scarlet Pimpernel will do aught to save that poor innocent
lamb, I would indeed bless him in my heart, and help him with all
my humble might if I could."</p>

<p>"May God's saints bless you for those words, mademoiselle," he
said, whilst, carried away by her beauty, her charm, her perfect
femininity, he stooped towards her until his knee touched the
carpet at her feet. "I had begun to lose my belief in my poor
misguided country, to think all men in France vile, and all women
base. I could thank you on my knees for your sweet words of
sympathy, for the expression of tender motherliness that came into
your eyes when you spoke of the poor forsaken Dauphin in the
Temple."</p>

<p>She did not restrain her tears; with her they came very easily,
just as with a child, and as they gathered in her eyes and rolled
down her fresh cheeks they in no way marred the charm of her face.
One hand lay in her lap fingering a diminutive bit of cambric,
which from time to time she pressed to her eyes. The other she had
almost unconsciously yielded to Armand.</p>

<p>The scent of the violets filled the room. It seemed to emanate
from her, a fitting attribute of her young, wholly unsophisticated
girlhood. The citizen was goodly to look at; he was kneeling at her
feet, and his lips were pressed against her hand.</p>

<p>Armand was young and he was an idealist. I do not for a moment
imagine that just at this moment he was deeply in love. The
stronger feeling had not yet risen up in him; it came later when
tragedy encompassed him and brought passion to sudden maturity.
Just now he was merely yielding himself up to the intoxicating
moment, with all the abandonment, all the enthusiasm of the Latin
race. There was no reason why he should not bend the knee before
this exquisite little cameo, that by its very presence was giving
him an hour of perfect pleasure and of aesthetic joy.</p>

<p>Outside the world continued its hideous, relentless way; men
butchered one another, fought and hated. Here in this small
old-world <i>salon</i>, with its faded satins and bits of
ivory-tinted lace, the outer universe had never really penetrated.
It was a tiny world&mdash;quite apart from the rest of mankind,
perfectly peaceful and absolutely beautiful.</p>

<p>If Armand had been allowed to depart from here now, without
having been the cause as well as the chief actor in the events that
followed, no doubt that Mademoiselle Lange would always have
remained a charming memory with him, an exquisite bouquet of
violets pressed reverently between the leaves of a favourite book
of poems, and the scent of spring flowers would in after years have
ever brought her dainty picture to his mind.</p>

<p>He was murmuring pretty words of endearment; carried away by
emotion, his arm stole round her waist; he felt that if another
tear came like a dewdrop rolling down her cheek he must kiss it
away at its very source. Passion was not sweeping them off their
feet&mdash;not yet, for they were very young, and life had not as
yet presented to them its most unsolvable problem.</p>

<p>But they yielded to one another, to the springtime of their
life, calling for Love, which would come presently hand in hand
with his grim attendant, Sorrow.</p>

<p>Even as Armand's glowing face was at last lifted up to hers
asking with mute lips for that first kiss which she already was
prepared to give, there came the loud noise of men's heavy
footsteps tramping up the old oak stairs, then some shouting, a
woman's cry, and the next moment Madame Belhomme, trembling,
wide-eyed, and in obvious terror, came rushing into the room.</p>

<p>"Jeanne! Jeanne! My child! It is awful! It is awful! <i>Mon
Dieu&mdash;mon Dieu!</i> What is to become of us?"</p>

<p>She was moaning and lamenting even as she ran in, and now she
threw her apron over her face and sank into a chair, continuing her
moaning and her lamentations.</p>

<p>Neither Mademoiselle nor Armand had stirred. They remained like
graven images, he on one knee, she with large eyes fixed upon his
face. They had neither of them looked on the old woman; they seemed
even now unconscious of her presence. But their ears had caught the
sound of that measured tramp of feet up the stairs of the old
house, and the halt upon the landing; they had heard the brief
words of command:</p>

<p>"Open, in the name of the people!"</p>

<p>They knew quite well what it all meant; they had not wandered so
far in the realms of romance that reality&mdash;the grim, horrible
reality of the moment&mdash;had not the power to bring them back to
earth.</p>

<p>That peremptory call to open in the name of the people was the
prologue these days to a drama which had but two concluding acts:
arrest, which was a certainty; the guillotine, which was more than
probable. Jeanne and Armand, these two young people who but a
moment ago had tentatively lifted the veil of life, looked straight
into each other's eyes and saw the hand of death interposed between
them: they looked straight into each other's eyes and knew that
nothing but the hand of death would part them now. Love had come
with its attendant, Sorrow; but he had come with no uncertain
footsteps. Jeanne looked on the man before her, and he bent his
head to imprint a glowing kiss upon her hand.</p>

<p>"Aunt Marie!"</p>

<p>It was Jeanne Lange who spoke, but her voice was no longer that
of an irresponsible child; it was firm, steady and hard. Though she
spoke to the old woman, she did not look at her; her luminous brown
eyes rested on the bowed head of Armand St. Just.</p>

<p>"Aunt Marie!" she repeated more peremptorily, for the old woman,
with her apron over her head, was still moaning, and unconscious of
all save an overmastering fear.</p>

<p>"Open, in the name of the people!" came in a loud harsh voice
once more from the other side of the front door.</p>

<p>"Aunt Marie, as you value your life and mine, pull yourself
together," said Jeanne firmly.</p>

<p>"What shall we do? Oh! what shall we do?" moaned Madame
Belhomme. But she had dragged the apron away from her face, and was
looking with some puzzlement at meek, gentle little Jeanne, who had
suddenly become so strange, so dictatorial, all unlike her habitual
somewhat diffident self.</p>

<p>"You need not have the slightest fear, Aunt Marie, if you will
only do as I tell you," resumed Jeanne quietly; "if you give way to
fear, we are all of us undone. As you value your life and mine,"
she now repeated authoritatively, "pull yourself together, and do
as I tell you."</p>

<p>The girl's firmness, her perfect quietude had the desired
effect. Madame Belhomme, though still shaken up with sobs of
terror, made a great effort to master herself; she stood up,
smoothed down her apron, passed her hand over her ruffled hair, and
said in a quaking voice:</p>

<p>"What do you think we had better do?"</p>

<p>"Go quietly to the door and open it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;the soldiers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you do not open quietly they will force the door open within
the next two minutes," interposed Jeanne calmly. "Go quietly and
open the door. Try and hide your fears, grumble in an audible voice
at being interrupted in your cooking, and tell the soldiers at once
that they will find mademoiselle in the boudoir. Go, for God's
sake!" she added, whilst suppressed emotion suddenly made her young
voice vibrate; "go, before they break open that door!"</p>

<p>Madame Belhomme, impressed and cowed, obeyed like an automaton.
She turned and marched fairly straight out of the room. It was not
a minute too soon. From outside had already come the third and
final summons:</p>

<p>"Open, in the name of the people!"</p>

<p>After that a crowbar would break open the door.</p>

<p>Madame Belhomme's heavy footsteps were heard crossing the
ante-chamber. Armand still knelt at Jeanne's feet, holding her
trembling little hand in his.</p>

<p>"A love-scene," she whispered rapidly, "a
love-scene&mdash;quick&mdash;do you know one?"</p>

<p>And even as he had tried to rise she held him back, down on his
knees.</p>

<p>He thought that fear was making her distracted.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle&mdash;" he murmured, trying to soothe her.</p>

<p>"Try and understand," she said with wonderful calm, "and do as I
tell you. Aunt Marie has obeyed. Will you do likewise?"</p>

<p>"To the death!" he whispered eagerly.</p>

<p>"Then a love-scene," she entreated. "Surely you know one.
Rodrigue and Chimène! Surely&mdash;surely," she urged, even as
tears of anguish rose into her eyes, "you must&mdash;you must, or,
if not that, something else. Quick! The very seconds are
precious!"</p>

<p>They were indeed! Madame Belhomme, obedient as a frightened dog,
had gone to the door and opened it; even her well-feigned
grumblings could now be heard and the rough interrogations from the
soldiery.</p>

<p>"Citizeness Lange!" said a gruff voice.</p>

<p>"In her boudoir, <i>quoi!</i>"</p>

<p>Madame Belhomme, braced up apparently by fear, was playing her
part remarkably well.</p>

<p>"Bothering good citizens! On baking day, too!" she went on
grumbling and muttering.</p>

<p>"Oh, think&mdash;think!" murmured Jeanne now in an agonised
whisper, her hot little hand grasping his so tightly that her nails
were driven into his flesh. "You must know something that will
do&mdash;anything&mdash;for dear life's sake...Armand!"</p>

<p>His name&mdash;in the tense excitement of this terrible
moment&mdash;had escaped her lips.</p>

<p>All in a flash of sudden intuition he understood what she
wanted, and even as the door of the boudoir was thrown violently
open Armand&mdash;still on his knees, but with one hand pressed to
his heart, the other stretched upwards to the ceiling in the most
approved dramatic style, was loudly declaiming:</p>

<p class="poem">"Pour venger son honneur il perdit son amour,<br>
Pour venger sa maîtresse il a quitté le jour!"</p>

<p>Whereupon Mademoiselle Lange feigned the most perfect
impatience.</p>

<p>"No, no, my good cousin," she said with a pretty <i>moue</i> of
disdain, "that will never do! You must not thus emphasise the end
of every line; the verses should flow more evenly, as thus..."</p>

<p>Héron had paused at the door. It was he who had thrown it
open&mdash;he who, followed by a couple of his sleuth-hounds, had
thought to find here the man denounced by de Batz as being one of
the followers of that irrepressible Scarlet Pimpernel. The
obviously Parisian intonation of the man kneeling in front of
citizeness Lange in an attitude no ways suggestive of personal
admiration, and coolly reciting verses out of a play, had somewhat
taken him aback.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he asked gruffly, striding forward into
the room and glaring first at mademoiselle, then at Armand.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle gave a little cry of surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, if it isn't citizen Héron!" she cried, jumping up with a
dainty movement of coquetry and embarrassment. "Why did not Aunt
Marie announce you?...It is indeed remiss of her, but she is so
ill-tempered on baking days I dare not even rebuke her. Won't you
sit down, citizen Héron? And you, cousin," she added, looking down
airily on Armand, "I pray you maintain no longer that foolish
attitude."</p>

<p>The febrileness of her manner, the glow in her cheeks were
easily attributable to natural shyness in face of this unexpected
visit. Héron, completely bewildered by this little scene, which was
so unlike what he expected, and so unlike those to which he was
accustomed in the exercise of his horrible duties, was practically
speechless before the little lady who continued to prattle along in
a simple, unaffected manner.</p>

<p>"Cousin," she said to Armand, who in the meanwhile had risen to
his knees, "this is citizen Héron, of whom you have heard me speak.
My cousin Belhomme," she continued, once more turning to Héron, "is
fresh from the country, citizen. He hails from Orléans, where he
has played leading parts in the tragedies of the late citizen
Corneille. But, ah me! I fear that he will find Paris audiences
vastly more critical than the good Orléanese. Did you hear him,
citizen, declaiming those beautiful verses just now? He was
murdering them, say I&mdash;yes, murdering them&mdash;the
gaby!"</p>

<p>Then only did it seem as if she realised that there was
something amiss, that citizen Héron had come to visit her, not as
an admirer of her talent who would wish to pay his respects to a
successful actress, but as a person to be looked on with dread.</p>

<p>She gave a quaint, nervous little laugh, and murmured in the
tones of a frightened child:</p>

<p>"La, citizen, how glum you look! I thought you had come to
compliment me on my latest success. I saw you at the theatre last
night, though you did not afterwards come to see me in the
green-room. Why! I had a regular ovation! Look at my flowers!" she
added more gaily, pointing to several bouquets in vases about the
room. "Citizen Danton brought me the violets himself, and citizen
Santerre the narcissi, and that laurel wreath&mdash;is it not
charming?&mdash;that was a tribute from citizen Robespierre
himself."</p>

<p>She was so artless, so simple, and so natural that Héron was
completely taken off his usual mental balance. He had expected to
find the usual setting to the dramatic episodes which he was wont
to conduct&mdash;screaming women, a man either at bay, sword in
hand, or hiding in a linen cupboard or up a chimney.</p>

<p>Now everything puzzled him. De Batz&mdash;he was quite
sure&mdash;had spoken of an Englishman, a follower of the Scarlet
Pimpernel; every thinking French patriot knew that all the
followers of the Scarlet Pimpernel were Englishmen with red hair
and prominent teeth, whereas this man...</p>

<p>Armand&mdash;who deadly danger had primed in his improvised
<i>rôle</i>&mdash;was striding up and down the room declaiming with
ever-varying intonations:</p>

<p class="poem">"Joignez tous vos efforts contre un espoir si
doux<br>
Pour en venir à bout, c'est trop peu que de vous."</p>

<p>"No! no!" said mademoiselle impatiently; "you must not make that
ugly pause midway in the last line: '<i>pour en venir à bout, c'est
trop peu que de vous</i>!'"</p>

<p>She mimicked Armand's diction so quaintly, imitating his stride,
his awkward gesture, and his faulty phraseology with such funny
exaggeration that Héron laughed in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"So that is a cousin from Orléans, is it?" he asked, throwing
his lanky body into an armchair, which creaked dismally under his
weight.</p>

<p>"Yes! a regular gaby&mdash;what?" she said archly. "Now, citizen
Héron, you must stay and take coffee with me. Aunt Marie will be
bringing it in directly. Hector," she added, turning to Armand,
"come down from the clouds and ask Aunt Marie to be quick."</p>

<p>This certainly was the first time in the whole of his experience
that Héron had been asked to stay and drink coffee with the quarry
he was hunting down. Mademoiselle's innocent little ways, her
desire for the prolongation of his visit, further addled his brain.
De Batz had undoubtedly spoken of an Englishman, and the cousin
from Orléans was certainly a Frenchman every inch of him.</p>

<p>Perhaps had the denunciation come from any one else but de Batz,
Héron might have acted and thought more circumspectly; but, of
course, the chief agent of the Committee of General Security was
more suspicious of the man from whom he took a heavy bribe than of
any one else in France. The thought had suddenly crossed his mind
that mayhap de Batz had sent him on a fool's errand in order to get
him safely out of the way of the Temple prison at a given hour of
the day.</p>

<p>The thought took shape, crystallised, caused him to see a rapid
vision of de Batz sneaking into his lodgings and stealing his keys,
the guard being slack, careless, inattentive, allowing the
adventurer to pass barriers that should have been closed against
all comers.</p>

<p>Now Héron was sure of it; it was all a conspiracy invented by de
Batz. He had forgotten all about his theories that a man under
arrest is always safer than a man that is free. Had his brain been
quite normal, and not obsessed, as it always was now by thoughts of
the Dauphin's escape from prison, no doubt he would have been more
suspicious of Armand, but all his worst suspicions were directed
against de Batz. Armand seemed to him just a fool, an actor
<i>quoi?</i> and so obviously not an Englishman.</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet, curtly declining mademoiselle's offers of
hospitality. He wanted to get away at once. Actors and actresses
were always, by tacit consent of the authorities, more immune than
the rest of the community. They provided the only amusement in the
intervals of the horrible scenes around the scaffolds; they were
irresponsible, harmless creatures who did not meddle in
politics.</p>

<p>Jeanne the while was gaily prattling on, her luminous eyes fixed
upon the all-powerful enemy, striving to read his thoughts, to
understand what went on behind those cruel, prominent eyes, the
chances that Armand had of safety and of life.</p>

<p>She knew, of course, that the visit was directed against
Armand&mdash;some one had betrayed him, that odious de Batz
mayhap&mdash;and she was fighting for Armand's safety, for his
life. Her armoury consisted of her presence of mind, her cool
courage, her self-control; she used all these weapons for his sake,
though at times she felt as if the strain on her nerves would snap
the thread of life in her. The effort seemed more than she could
bear.</p>

<p>But she kept up her part, rallying Héron for the shortness of
his visit, begging him to tarry for another five minutes at least,
throwing out&mdash;with subtle feminine intuition&mdash;just those
very hints anent little Capet's safety that were most calculated to
send him flying back towards the Temple.</p>

<p>"I felt so honoured last night, citizen," she said coquettishly,
"that you even forgot little Capet in order to come and watch my
<i>début</i> as Célimène."</p>

<p>"Forget him!" retorted Héron, smothering a curse, "I never
forget the vermin. I must go back to him; there are too many cats
nosing round my mouse. Good day to you, citizeness. I ought to have
brought flowers, I know; but I am a busy man&mdash;a harassed
man."</p>

<p>"<i>Je te crois</i>," she said with a grave nod of the head;
"but do come to the theatre to-night. I am playing
Camille&mdash;such a fine part! one of my greatest successes."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'll come&mdash;mayhap, mayhap&mdash;but I'll go
now&mdash;glad to have seen you, citizeness. Where does your cousin
lodge?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Here," she replied boldly, on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>"Good. Let him report himself to-morrow morning at the
Conciergerie, and get his certificate of safety. It is a new
decree, and you should have one, too."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Hector and I will come together, and perhaps
Aunt Marie will come too. Don't send us to <i>maman</i> guillotine
yet awhile, citizen," she said lightly; "you will never get such
another Camille, nor yet so good a Célimène."</p>

<p>She was gay, artless to the last. She accompanied Héron to the
door herself, chaffing him about his escort.</p>

<p>"You are an <i>aristo</i>, citizen," she said, gazing with
well-feigned admiration on the two sleuth-hounds who stood in wait
in the anteroom; "it makes me proud to see so many citizens at my
door. Come and see me play Camille&mdash;come to-night, and don't
forget the green-room door&mdash;it will always be kept invitingly
open for you."</p>

<p>She bobbed him a curtsey, and he walked out, closely followed by
his two men; then at last she closed the door behind them. She
stood there for a while, her ear glued against the massive panels,
listening for their measured tread down the oak staircase. At last
it rang more sharply against the flagstones of the courtyard below;
then she was satisfied that they had gone, and went slowly back to
the boudoir.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10. Shadows</h2>

<p>The tension on her nerves relaxed; there was the inevitable
reaction. Her knees were shaking under her, and she literally
staggered into the room.</p>

<p>But Armand was already near her, down on both his knees this
time, his arms clasping the delicate form that swayed like the
slender stems of narcissi in the breeze.</p>

<p>"Oh! you must go out of Paris at once&mdash;at once," she said
through sobs which no longer would be kept back.</p>

<p>"He'll return&mdash;I know that he will return&mdash;and you
will not be safe until you are back in England."</p>

<p>But he could not think of himself or of anything in the future.
He had forgotten Héron, Paris, the world; he could only think of
her.</p>

<p>"I owe my life to you!" he murmured. "Oh, how beautiful you
are&mdash;how brave! How I love you!"</p>

<p>It seemed that he had always loved her, from the moment that
first in his boyish heart he had set up an ideal to worship, and
then, last night, in the box of the theatre&mdash;he had his back
turned toward the stage, and was ready to go&mdash;her voice had
called him back; it had held him spellbound; her voice, and also
her eyes...He did not know then that it was Love which then and
there had enchained him. Oh, how foolish he had been! for now he
knew that he had loved her with all his might, with all his soul,
from the very instant that his eyes had rested upon her.</p>

<p>He babbled along&mdash;incoherently&mdash;in the intervals of
covering her hands and the hem of her gown with kisses. He stooped
right down to the ground and kissed the arch of her instep; he had
become a devotee worshipping at the shrine of his saint, who had
performed a great and a wonderful miracle.</p>

<p>Armand the idealist had found his ideal in a woman. That was the
great miracle which the woman herself had performed for him. He
found in her all that he had admired most, all that he had admired
in the leader who hitherto had been the only personification of his
ideal. But Jeanne possessed all those qualities which had roused
his enthusiasm in the noble hero whom he revered. Her pluck, her
ingenuity, her calm devotion which had averted the threatened
danger from him!</p>

<p>What had he done that she should have risked her own sweet life
for his sake?</p>

<p>But Jeanne did not know. She could not tell. Her nerves now were
somewhat unstrung, and the tears that always came so readily to her
eyes flowed quite unchecked. She could not very well move, for he
held her knees imprisoned in his arms, but she was quite content to
remain like this, and to yield her hands to him so that he might
cover them with kisses.</p>

<p>Indeed, she did not know at what precise moment love for him had
been born in her heart. Last night, perhaps...she could not say ...
but when they parted she felt that she must see him again...and
then today...perhaps it was the scent of the violets...they were so
exquisitely sweet...perhaps it was his enthusiasm and his talk
about England...but when Héron came she knew that she must save
Armand's life at all cost...that she would die if they dragged him
away to prison.</p>

<p>Thus these two children philosophised, trying to understand the
mystery of the birth of Love. But they were only children; they did
not really understand. Passion was sweeping them off their feet,
because a common danger had bound them irrevocably to one another.
The womanly instinct to save and to protect had given the young
girl strength to bear a difficult part, and now she loved him for
the dangers from which she had rescued him, and he loved her
because she had risked her life for him.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The hours sped on; there was so much to say, so much that was
exquisite to listen to. The shades of evening were gathering fast;
the room, with its pale-toned hangings and faded tapestries, was
sinking into the arms of gloom. Aunt Marie was no doubt too
terrified to stir out of her kitchen; she did not bring the lamps,
but the darkness suited Armand's mood, and Jeanne was glad that the
gloaming effectually hid the perpetual blush in her cheeks.</p>

<p>In the evening air the dying flowers sent their heady fragrance
around. Armand was intoxicated with the perfume of violets that
clung to Jeanne's fingers, with the touch of her satin gown that
brushed his cheek, with the murmur of her voice that quivered
through her tears.</p>

<p>No noise from the ugly outer world reached this secluded spot.
In the tiny square outside a street lamp had been lighted, and its
feeble rays came peeping in through the lace curtains at the
window. They caught the dainty silhouette of the young girl,
playing with the loose tendrils of her hair around her forehead,
and outlining with a thin band of light the contour of neck and
shoulder, making the satin of her gown shimmer with an opalescent
glow.</p>

<p>Armand rose from his knees. Her eyes were calling to him, her
lips were ready to yield.</p>

<p>"<i>Tu m'aimes?</i>" he whispered.</p>

<p>And like a tired child she sank upon his breast.</p>

<p>He kissed her hair, her eyes, her lips; her skin was fragrant as
the flowers of spring, the tears on her cheeks glistened like
morning dew.</p>

<p><br>
Aunt Marie came in at last, carrying the lamp. She found them
sitting side by side, like two children, hand in hand, mute with
the eloquence which comes from boundless love. They were under a
spell, forgetting even that they lived, knowing nothing except that
they loved.</p>

<p>The lamp broke the spell, and Aunt Marie's still trembling
voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! how did you manage to rid yourself of those
brutes?"</p>

<p>But she asked no other question, even when the lamp showed up
quite clearly the glowing cheeks of Jeanne and the ardent eyes of
Armand. In her heart, long since atrophied, there were a few
memories, carefully put away in a secret cell, and those memories
caused the old woman to understand.</p>

<p>Neither Jeanne nor Armand noticed what she did; the spell had
been broken, but the dream lingered on; they did not see Aunt Marie
putting the room tidy, and then quietly tiptoeing out by the
door.</p>

<p>But through the dream, reality was struggling for recognition.
After Armand had asked for the hundredth time: "<i>Tu m'aimes?</i>"
and Jeanne for the hundredth time had replied mutely with her eyes,
her fears for him suddenly returned.</p>

<p>Something had awakened her from her trance&mdash;a heavy
footstep, mayhap, in the street below, the distant roll of a drum,
or only the clash of steel saucepans in Aunt Marie's kitchen. But
suddenly Jeanne was alert, and with her alertness came terror for
the beloved.</p>

<p>"Your life," she said&mdash;for he had called her his life just
then, "your life&mdash;and I was forgetting that it is still in
danger...your dear, your precious life!"</p>

<p>"Doubly dear now," he replied, "since I owe it to you."</p>

<p>"Then I pray you, I entreat you, guard it well for my
sake&mdash;make all haste to leave Paris...oh, this I beg of you!"
she continued more earnestly, seeing the look of demur in his eyes;
"every hour you spend in it brings danger nearer to your door."</p>

<p>"I could not leave Paris while you are here."</p>

<p>"But I am safe here," she urged; "quite, quite safe, I assure
you. I am only a poor actress, and the Government takes no heed of
us mimes. Men must be amused, even between the intervals of killing
one another. Indeed, indeed, I should be far safer here now,
waiting quietly for awhile, while you make preparations to go...My
hasty departure at this moment would bring disaster on us
both."</p>

<p>There was logic in what she said. And yet how could he leave
her? now that he had found this perfect woman&mdash;this
realisation of his highest ideals, how could he go and leave her in
this awful Paris, with brutes like Héron forcing their hideous
personality into her sacred presence, threatening that very life he
would gladly give his own to keep inviolate?</p>

<p>"Listen, sweetheart," he said after awhile, when presently
reason struggled back for first place in his mind. "Will you allow
me to consult with my chief, with the Scarlet Pimpernel, who is in
Paris at the present moment? I am under his orders; I could not
leave France just now. My life, my entire person are at his
disposal. I and my comrades are here under his orders, for a great
undertaking which he has not yet unfolded to us, but which I firmly
believe is framed for the rescue of the Dauphin from the
Temple."</p>

<p>She gave an involuntary exclamation of horror.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she said quickly and earnestly; "as far as you are
concerned, Armand, that has now become an impossibility. Some one
has betrayed you, and you are henceforth a marked man. I think that
odious de Batz had a hand in Héron's visit of this afternoon. We
succeeded in putting these spies off the scent, but only for a
moment...within a few hours&mdash;less perhaps&mdash;Héron will
repent him of his carelessness; he'll come back&mdash;I know that
he will come back. He may leave me, personally, alone; but he will
be on your track; he'll drag you to the Conciergerie to report
yourself, and there your true name and history are bound to come to
light. If you succeed in evading him, he will still be on your
track. If the Scarlet Pimpernel keeps you in Paris now, your death
will be at his door."</p>

<p>Her voice had become quite hard and trenchant as she said these
last words; womanlike, she was already prepared to hate the man
whose mysterious personality she had hitherto admired, now that the
life and safety of Armand appeared to depend on the will of that
elusive hero.</p>

<p>"You must not be afraid for me, Jeanne," he urged. "The Scarlet
Pimpernel cares for all his followers; he would never allow me to
run unnecessary risks."</p>

<p>She was unconvinced, almost jealous now of his enthusiasm for
that unknown man. Already she had taken full possession of Armand;
she had purchased his life, and he had given her his love. She
would share neither treasure with that nameless leader who held
Armand's allegiance.</p>

<p>"It is only for a little while, sweetheart," he reiterated again
and again. "I could not, anyhow, leave Paris whilst I feel that you
are here, maybe in danger. The thought would be horrible. I should
go mad if I had to leave you."</p>

<p>Then he talked again of England, of his life there, of the
happiness and peace that were in store for them both.</p>

<p>"We will go to England together," he whispered, "and there we
will be happy together, you and I. We will have a tiny house among
the Kentish hills, and its walls will be covered with honeysuckle
and roses. At the back of the house there will be an orchard, and
in May, when the fruit-blossom is fading and soft spring breezes
blow among the trees, showers of sweet-scented petals will envelop
us as we walk along, falling on us like fragrant snow. You will
come, sweetheart, will you not?"</p>

<p>"If you still wish it, Armand," she murmured.</p>

<p>Still wish it! He would gladly go to-morrow if she would come
with him. But, of course, that could not be arranged. She had her
contract to fulfil at the theatre, then there would be her house
and furniture to dispose of, and there was Aunt Marie...But, of
course, Aunt Marie would come too...She thought that she could get
away some time before the spring; and he swore that he could not
leave Paris until she came with him.</p>

<p>It seemed a terrible deadlock, for she could not bear to think
of him alone in those awful Paris streets, where she knew that
spies would always be tracking him. She had no illusions as to the
impression which she had made on Héron; she knew that it could only
be a momentary one, and that Armand would henceforth be in daily,
hourly danger.</p>

<p>At last she promised him that she would take the advice of his
chief; they would both be guided by what he said. Armand would
confide in him to-night, and if it could be arranged she would
hurry on her preparations and, mayhap, be ready to join him in a
week.</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile, that cruel man must not risk your dear life,"
she said. "Remember, Armand, your life belongs to me. Oh, I could
hate him for the love you bear him!"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!" he said earnestly. "Dear heart, you must
not speak like that of the man whom, next to your perfect self, I
love most upon earth."</p>

<p>"You think of him more than of me. I shall scarce live until I
know that you are safely out of Paris."</p>

<p>Though it was horrible to part, yet it was best, perhaps, that
he should go back to his lodgings now, in case Héron sent his spies
back to her door, and since he meant to consult with his chief. She
had a vague hope that if the mysterious hero was indeed the
noble-hearted man whom Armand represented him to be, surely he
would take compassion on the anxiety of a sorrowing woman, and
release the man she loved from bondage.</p>

<p>This thought pleased her and gave her hope. She even urged
Armand now to go.</p>

<p>"When may I see you to-morrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"But it will be so dangerous to meet," she argued.</p>

<p>"I must see you. I could not live through the day without seeing
you."</p>

<p>"The theatre is the safest place."</p>

<p>"I could not wait till the evening. May I not come here?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Héron's spies may be about."</p>

<p>"Where then?"</p>

<p>She thought it over for a moment.</p>

<p>"At the stage-door of the theatre at one o'clock," she said at
last. "We shall have finished rehearsal. Slip into the
<i>guichet</i> of the concierge. I will tell him to admit you, and
send my dresser to meet you there; she will bring you along to my
room, where we shall be undisturbed for at least half an hour."</p>

<p>He had perforce to be content with that, though he would so much
rather have seen her here again, where the faded tapestries and
soft-toned hangings made such a perfect background for her delicate
charm. He had every intention of confiding in Blakeney, and of
asking his help for getting Jeanne out of Paris as quickly as may
be.</p>

<p>Thus this perfect hour was past; the most pure, the fullest of
joy that these two young people were ever destined to know. Perhaps
they felt within themselves the consciousness that their great love
would rise anon to yet greater, fuller perfection when Fate had
crowned it with his halo of sorrow. Perhaps, too, it was that
consciousness that gave to their kisses now the solemnity of a last
farewell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11. The League Of The
Scarlet Pimpernel</h2>

<p>Armand never could say definitely afterwards whither he went
when he left the Square du Roule that evening. No doubt he wandered
about the streets for some time in an absent, mechanical way,
paying no heed to the passers-by, none to the direction in which he
was going.</p>

<p>His mind was full of Jeanne, her beauty, her courage, her
attitude in face of the hideous bloodhound who had come to pollute
that charming old-world boudoir by his loathsome presence. He
recalled every word she uttered, every gesture she made.</p>

<p>He was a man in love for the first time&mdash;wholly,
irremediably in love.</p>

<p>I suppose that it was the pangs of hunger that first recalled
him to himself. It was close on eight o'clock now, and he had fed
on his imaginings&mdash;first on anticipation, then on realisation,
and lastly on memory&mdash;during the best part of the day. Now he
awoke from his day-dream to find himself tired and hungry, but
fortunately not very far from that quarter of Paris where food is
easily obtainable.</p>

<p>He was somewhere near the Madeleine&mdash;a quarter he knew
well. Soon he saw in front of him a small eating-house which looked
fairly clean and orderly. He pushed open its swing-door, and seeing
an empty table in a secluded part of the room, he sat down and
ordered some supper.</p>

<p>The place made no impression upon his memory. He could not have
told you an hour later where it was situated, who had served him,
what he had eaten, or what other persons were present in the
dining-room at the time that he himself entered it.</p>

<p>Having eaten, however, he felt more like his normal
self&mdash;more conscious of his actions. When he finally left the
eating-house, he realised, for instance, that it was very
cold&mdash;a fact of which he had for the past few hours been
totally unaware. The snow was falling in thin close flakes, and a
biting north-easterly wind was blowing those flakes into his face
and down his collar. He wrapped his cloak tightly around him. It
was a good step yet to Blakeney's lodgings, where he knew that he
was expected.</p>

<p>He struck quickly into the Rue St. Honoré, avoiding the great
open places where the grim horrors of this magnificent city in
revolt against civilisation were displayed in all their grim
nakedness&mdash;on the Place de la Révolution the guillotine, on
the Carrousel the open-air camps of workers under the lash of
slave-drivers more cruel than the uncivilised brutes of the Far
West.</p>

<p>And Armand had to think of Jeanne in the midst of all these
horrors. She was still a petted actress to-day, but who could tell
if on the morrow the terrible law of the "suspect" would not reach
her in order to drag her before a tribunal that knew no mercy, and
whose sole justice was a condemnation?</p>

<p>The young man hurried on; he was anxious to be among his own
comrades, to hear his chief's pleasant voice, to feel assured that
by all the sacred laws of friendship Jeanne henceforth would become
the special care of the Scarlet Pimpernel and his league.</p>

<p>Blakeney lodged in a small house situated on the Quai de
l'Ecole, at the back of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, from whence he had
a clear and uninterrupted view across the river, as far as the
irregular block of buildings of the Châtelet prison and the house
of Justice.</p>

<p>The same tower-clock that two centuries ago had tolled the
signal for the massacre of the Huguenots was even now striking
nine. Armand slipped through the half-open <i>porte cochère</i>,
crossed the narrow dark courtyard, and ran up two flights of
winding stone stairs. At the top of these, a door on his right
allowed a thin streak of light to filtrate between its two folds.
An iron bell handle hung beside it; Armand gave it a pull.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he was amongst his friends. He heaved a great
sigh of content and relief. The very atmosphere here seemed to be
different. As far as the lodging itself was concerned, it was as
bare, as devoid of comfort as those sort of places&mdash;so-called
<i>chambres garnies</i>&mdash;usually were in these days. The
chairs looked rickety and uninviting, the sofa was of black
horsehair, the carpet was threadbare, and in places in actual
holes; but there was a certain something in the air which revealed,
in the midst of all this squalor, the presence of a man of
fastidious taste.</p>

<p>To begin with, the place was spotlessly clean; the stove, highly
polished, gave forth a pleasing warm glow, even whilst the window,
slightly open, allowed a modicum of fresh air to enter the room. In
a rough earthenware jug on the table stood a large bunch of
Christmas roses, and to the educated nostril the slight scent of
perfumes that hovered in the air was doubly pleasing after the
fetid air of the narrow streets.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was there, also my Lord Tony, and Lord
Hastings. They greeted Armand with whole-hearted cheeriness.</p>

<p>"Where is Blakeney?" asked the young man as soon as he had
shaken his friends by the hand.</p>

<p>"Present!" came in loud, pleasant accents from the door of an
inner room on the right.</p>

<p>And there he stood under the lintel of the door, the man against
whom was raised the giant hand of an entire nation&mdash;the man
for whose head the revolutionary government of France would gladly
pay out all the savings of its Treasury&mdash;the man whom human
bloodhounds were tracking, hot on the scent&mdash;for whom the nets
of a bitter revenge and relentless reprisals were constantly being
spread.</p>

<p>Was he unconscious of it, or merely careless? His closest
friend, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, could not say. Certain it is that, as
he now appeared before Armand, picturesque as ever in perfectly
tailored clothes, with priceless lace at throat and wrists, his
slender fingers holding an enamelled snuff-box and a handkerchief
of delicate cambric, his whole personality that of a dandy rather
than a man of action, it seemed impossible to connect him with the
foolhardy escapades which had set one nation glowing with
enthusiasm and another clamouring for revenge.</p>

<p>But it was the magnetism that emanated from him that could not
be denied; the light that now and then, swift as summer lightning,
flashed out from the depths of the blue eyes usually veiled by
heavy, lazy lids, the sudden tightening of firm lips, the setting
of the square jaw, which in a moment&mdash;but only for the space
of a second&mdash;transformed the entire face, and revealed the
born leader of men.</p>

<p>Just now there was none of that in the <i>débonnair</i>,
easy-going man of the world who advanced to meet his friend. Armand
went quickly up to him, glad to grasp his hand, slightly troubled
with remorse, no doubt, at the recollection of his adventure of
to-day. It almost seemed to him that from beneath his half-closed
lids Blakeney had shot a quick inquiring glance upon him. The quick
flash seemed to light up the young man's soul from within, and to
reveal it, naked, to his friend.</p>

<p>It was all over in a moment, and Armand thought that mayhap his
conscience had played him a trick: there was nothing apparent in
him&mdash;of this he was sure&mdash;that could possibly divulge his
secret just yet.</p>

<p>"I am rather late, I fear," he said. "I wandered about the
streets in the late afternoon and lost my way in the dark. I hope I
have not kept you all waiting."</p>

<p>They all pulled chairs closely round the fire, except Blakeney,
who preferred to stand. He waited awhile until they were all
comfortably settled, and all ready to listen, then:</p>

<p>"It is about the Dauphin," he said abruptly without further
preamble.</p>

<p>They understood. All of them had guessed it, almost before the
summons came that had brought them to Paris two days ago. Sir
Andrew Ffoulkes had left his young wife because of that, and Armand
had demanded it as a right to join hands in this noble work.
Blakeney had not left France for over three months now. Backwards
and forwards between Paris, or Nantes, or Orléans to the coast,
where his friends would meet him to receive those unfortunates whom
one man's whole-hearted devotion had rescued from death; backwards
and forwards into the very hearts of those cities wherein an army
of sleuth-hounds were on his track, and the guillotine was
stretching out her arms to catch the foolhardy adventurer.</p>

<p>Now it was about the Dauphin. They all waited, breathless and
eager, the fire of a noble enthusiasm burning in their hearts. They
waited in silence, their eyes fixed on the leader, lest one single
word from him should fail to reach their ears.</p>

<p>The full magnetism of the man was apparent now. As he held these
four men at this moment, he could have held a crowd. The man of the
world&mdash;the fastidious dandy&mdash;had shed his mask; there
stood the leader, calm, serene in the very face of the most deadly
danger that had ever encompassed any man, looking that danger fully
in the face, not striving to belittle it or to exaggerate it, but
weighing it in the balance with what there was to accomplish: the
rescue of a martyred, innocent child from the hands of fiends who
were destroying his very soul even more completely than his
body.</p>

<p>"Everything, I think, is prepared," resumed Sir Percy after a
slight pause. "The Simons have been summarily dismissed; I learned
that to-day. They remove from the Temple on Sunday next, the
nineteenth. Obviously that is the one day most likely to help us in
our operations. As far as I am concerned, I cannot make any
hard-and-fast plans. Chance at the last moment will have to
dictate. But from every one of you I must have co-operation, and it
can only be by your following my directions implicitly that we can
even remotely hope to succeed."</p>

<p>He crossed and recrossed the room once or twice before he spoke
again, pausing now and again in his walk in front of a large map of
Paris and its environs that hung upon the wall, his tall figure
erect, his hands behind his back, his eyes fixed before him as if
he saw right through the walls of this squalid room, and across the
darkness that overhung the city, through the grim bastions of the
mighty building far away, where the descendant of a hundred kings
lived at the mercy of human fiends who worked for his
abasement.</p>

<p>The man's face now was that of a seer and a visionary; the firm
lines were set and rigid as those of an image carved in
stone&mdash;the statue of heart-whole devotion, with the
self-imposed task beckoning sternly to follow, there where lurked
danger and death.</p>

<p>"The way, I think, in which we could best succeed would be
this," he resumed after a while, sitting now on the edge of the
table and directly facing his four friends. The light from the lamp
which stood upon the table behind him fell full upon those four
glowing faces fixed eagerly upon him, but he himself was in shadow,
a massive silhouette broadly cut out against the light-coloured map
on the wall beyond.</p>

<p>"I remain here, of course, until Sunday," he said, "and will
closely watch my opportunity, when I can with the greatest amount
of safety enter the Temple building and take possession of the
child. I shall, of course choose the moment when the Simons are
actually on the move, with their successors probably coming in at
about the same time. God alone knows," he added earnestly, "how I
shall contrive to get possession of the child; at the moment I am
just as much in the dark about that as you are."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and suddenly his grave face seemed flooded
with sunshine, a kind of lazy merriment danced in his eyes,
effacing all trace of solemnity within them.</p>

<p>"La!" he said lightly, "on one point I am not at all in the
dark, and that is that His Majesty King Louis XVII will come out of
that ugly house in my company next Sunday, the nineteenth day of
January in this year of grace seventeen hundred and ninety-four;
and this, too, do I know&mdash;that those murderous blackguards
shall not lay hands on me whilst that precious burden is in my
keeping. So I pray you, my good Armand, do not look so glum," he
added with his pleasant, merry laugh; "you'll need all your wits
about you to help us in our undertaking."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do, Percy?" said the young man
simply.</p>

<p>"In one moment I will tell you. I want you all to understand the
situation first. The child will be out of the Temple on Sunday, but
at what hour I know not. The later it will be the better would it
suit my purpose, for I cannot get him out of Paris before evening
with any chance of safety. Here we must risk nothing; the child is
far better off as he is now than he would be if he were dragged
back after an abortive attempt at rescue. But at this hour of the
night, between nine and ten o'clock, I can arrange to get him out
of Paris by the Villette gate, and that is where I want you,
Ffoulkes, and you, Tony, to be, with some kind of covered cart,
yourselves in any disguise your ingenuity will suggest. Here are a
few certificates of safety; I have been making a collection of them
for some time, as they are always useful."</p>

<p>He dived into the wide pocket of his coat and drew forth a
number of cards, greasy, much-fingered documents of the usual
pattern which the Committee of General Security delivered to the
free citizens of the new republic, and without which no one could
enter or leave any town or country commune without being detained
as "suspect." He glanced at them and handed them over to
Ffoulkes.</p>

<p>"Choose your own identity for the occasion, my good friend," he
said lightly; "and you too, Tony. You may be stonemasons or
coal-carriers, chimney-sweeps or farm-labourers, I care not which
so long as you look sufficiently grimy and wretched to be
unrecognisable, and so long as you can procure a cart without
arousing suspicions, and can wait for me punctually at the
appointed spot."</p>

<p>Ffoulkes turned over the cards, and with a laugh handed them
over to Lord Tony. The two fastidious gentlemen discussed for
awhile the respective merits of a chimney-sweep's uniform as
against that of a coal-carrier.</p>

<p>"You can carry more grime if you are a sweep," suggested
Blakeney; "and if the soot gets into your eyes it does not make
them smart like coal does."</p>

<p>"But soot adheres more closely," argued Tony solemnly, "and I
know that we shan't get a bath for at least a week afterwards."</p>

<p>"Certainly you won't, you sybarite!" asserted Sir Percy with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"After a week soot might become permanent," mused Sir Andrew,
wondering what, under the circumstance, my lady would say to
him.</p>

<p>"If you are both so fastidious," retorted Blakeney, shrugging
his broad shoulders, "I'll turn one of you into a reddleman, and
the other into a dyer. Then one of you will be bright scarlet to
the end of his days, as the reddle never comes off the skin at all,
and the other will have to soak in turpentine before the dye will
consent to move...In either case...oh, my dear Tony!...the
smell..."</p>

<p>He laughed like a schoolboy in anticipation of a prank, and held
his scented handkerchief to his nose. My Lord Hastings chuckled
audibly, and Tony punched him for this unseemly display of
mirth.</p>

<p>Armand watched the little scene in utter amazement. He had been
in England over a year, and yet he could not understand these
Englishmen. Surely they were the queerest, most inconsequent people
in the world. Here were these men, who were engaged at this very
moment in an enterprise which for cool-headed courage and foolhardy
daring had probably no parallel in history. They were literally
taking their lives in their hands, in all probability facing
certain death; and yet they now sat chaffing and fighting like a
crowd of third-form schoolboys, talking utter, silly nonsense, and
making foolish jokes that would have shamed a Frenchman in his
teens. Vaguely he wondered what fat, pompous de Batz would think of
this discussion if he could overhear it. His contempt, no doubt,
for the Scarlet Pimpernel and his followers would be increased
tenfold.</p>

<p>Then at last the question of the disguise was effectually
dismissed. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Anthony Dewhurst had
settled their differences of opinion by solemnly agreeing to
represent two over-grimy and overheated coal-heavers. They chose
two certificates of safety that were made out in the names of Jean
Lepetit and Achille Grospierre, labourers.</p>

<p>"Though you don't look at all like an Achille, Tony," was
Blakeney's parting shot to his friend.</p>

<p>Then without any transition from this schoolboy nonsense to the
serious business of the moment, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes said
abruptly:</p>

<p>"Tell us exactly, Blakeney, where you will want the cart to
stand on Sunday."</p>

<p>Blakeney rose and turned to the map against the wall, Ffoulkes
and Tony following him. They stood close to his elbow whilst his
slender, nervy hand wandered along the shiny surface of the
varnished paper. At last he placed his finger on one spot.</p>

<p>"Here you see," he said, "is the Villette gate. Just outside it
a narrow street on the right leads down in the direction of the
canal. It is just at the bottom of that narrow street at its
junction with the tow-path there that I want you two and the cart
to be. It had better be a coal-car by the way; they will be
unloading coal close by there to-morrow," he added with one of his
sudden irrepressible outbursts of merriment. "You and Tony can
exercise your muscles coal-heaving, and incidentally make
yourselves known in the neighbourhood as good if somewhat grimy
patriots."</p>

<p>"We had better take up our parts at once then," said Tony. "I'll
take a fond farewell of my clean shirt to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will not see one again for some time, my good Tony.
After your hard day's work to-morrow you will have to sleep either
inside your cart, if you have already secured one, or under the
arches of the canal bridge, if you have not."</p>

<p>"I hope you have an equally pleasant prospect for Hastings," was
my Lord Tony's grim comment.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that he was as happy as a schoolboy about to
start for a holiday. Lord Tony was a true sportsman. Perhaps there
was in him less sentiment for the heroic work which he did under
the guidance of his chief than an inherent passion for dangerous
adventures. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, on the other hand, thought perhaps
a little less of the adventure, but a great deal of the martyred
child in the Temple. He was just as buoyant, just as keen as his
friend, but the leaven of sentiment raised his sporting instincts
to perhaps a higher plane of self-devotion.</p>

<p>"Well, now, to recapitulate," he said, in turn following with
his finger the indicated route on the map. "Tony and I and the
coal-cart will await you on this spot, at the corner of the towpath
on Sunday evening at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"And your signal, Blakeney?" asked Tony.</p>

<p>"The usual one," replied Sir Percy, "the seamew's cry thrice
repeated at brief intervals. But now," he continued, turning to
Armand and Hastings, who had taken no part in the discussion
hitherto, "I want your help a little further afield."</p>

<p>"I thought so," nodded Hastings.</p>

<p>"The coal-cart, with its usual miserable nag, will carry us a
distance of fifteen or sixteen kilometres, but no more. My purpose
is to cut along the north of the city, and to reach St. Germain,
the nearest point where we can secure good mounts. There is a
farmer just outside the commune; his name is Achard. He has
excellent horses, which I have borrowed before now; we shall want
five, of course, and he has one powerful beast that will do for me,
as I shall have, in addition to my own weight, which is
considerable, to take the child with me on the pillion. Now you,
Hastings and Armand, will have to start early to-morrow morning,
leave Paris by the Neuilly gate, and from there make your way to
St. Germain by any conveyance you can contrive to obtain. At St.
Germain you must at once find Achard's farm; disguised as labourers
you will not arouse suspicion by so doing. You will find the farmer
quite amenable to money, and you must secure the best horses you
can get for our own use, and, if possible, the powerful mount I
spoke of just now. You are both excellent horse-men, therefore I
selected you amongst the others for this special errand, for you
two, with the five horses, will have to come and meet our coal-cart
some seventeen kilometres out of St. Germain, to where the first
sign-post indicates the road to Courbevoie. Some two hundred mètres
down this road on the right there is a small spinney, which will
afford splendid shelter for yourselves and your horses. We hope to
be there at about one o'clock after midnight of Monday morning.
Now, is all that quite clear, and are you both satisfied?"</p>

<p>"It is quite clear," exclaimed Hastings placidly; "but I, for
one, am not at all satisfied."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it is all too easy. We get none of the danger."</p>

<p>"Oho! I thought that you would bring that argument forward, you
incorrigible grumbler," laughed Sir Percy good-humouredly. "Let me
tell you that if you start to-morrow from Paris in that spirit you
will run your head and Armand's into a noose long before you reach
the gate of Neuilly. I cannot allow either of you to cover your
faces with too much grime; an honest farm labourer should not look
over-dirty, and your chances of being discovered and detained are,
at the outset, far greater than those which Ffoulkes and Tony will
run&mdash;"</p>

<p>Armand had said nothing during this time. While Blakeney was
unfolding his plan for him and for Lord Hastings&mdash;a plan which
practically was a command&mdash;he had sat with his arms folded
across his chest, his head sunk upon his breast. When Blakeney had
asked if they were satisfied, he had taken no part in Hastings'
protest nor responded to his leader's good-humoured banter.</p>

<p>Though he did not look up even now, yet he felt that Percy's
eyes were fixed upon him, and they seemed to scorch into his soul.
He made a great effort to appear eager like the others, and yet
from the first a chill had struck at his heart. He could not leave
Paris before he had seen Jeanne.</p>

<p>He looked up suddenly, trying to seem unconcerned; he even
looked his chief fully in the face.</p>

<p>"When ought we to leave Paris?" he asked calmly.</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> leave at daybreak," replied Blakeney with a
slight, almost imperceptible emphasis on the word of command. "When
the gates are first opened, and the work-people go to and fro at
their work, that is the safest hour. And you must be at St. Germain
as soon as may be, or the farmer may not have a sufficiency of
horses available at a moment's notice. I want you to be spokesman
with Achard, so that Hastings' British accent should not betray you
both. Also you might not get a conveyance for St. Germain
immediately. We must think of every eventuality, Armand. There is
so much at stake."</p>

<p>Armand made no further comment just then. But the others looked
astonished. Armand had but asked a simple question, and Blakeney's
reply seemed almost like a rebuke&mdash;so circumstantial too, and
so explanatory. He was so used to being obeyed at a word, so
accustomed that the merest wish, the slightest hint from him was
understood by his band of devoted followers, that the long
explanation of his orders which he gave to Armand struck them all
with a strange sense of unpleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Hastings was the first to break the spell that seemed to have
fallen over the party.</p>

<p>"We leave at daybreak, of course," he said, "as soon as the
gates are open. We can, I know, get one of the carriers to give us
a lift as far as St. Germain. There, how do we find Achard?"</p>

<p>"He is a well-known farmer," replied Blakeney. "You have but to
ask."</p>

<p>"Good. Then we bespeak five horses for the next day, find
lodgings in the village that night, and make a fresh start back
towards Paris in the evening of Sunday. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"Yes. One of you will have two horses on the lead, the other
one. Pack some fodder on the empty saddles and start at about ten
o'clock. Ride straight along the main road, as if you were making
back for Paris, until you come to four cross-roads with a sign-post
pointing to Courbevoie. Turn down there and go along the road until
you meet a close spinney of fir-trees on your right. Make for the
interior of that. It gives splendid shelter, and you can dismount
there and give the horses a feed. We'll join you one hour after
midnight. The night will be dark, I hope, and the moon anyhow will
be on the wane."</p>

<p>"I think I understand. Anyhow, it's not difficult, and we'll be
as careful as may be."</p>

<p>"You will have to keep your heads clear, both of you," concluded
Blakeney.</p>

<p>He was looking at Armand as he said this; but the young man had
not made a movement during this brief colloquy between Hastings and
the chief. He still sat with arms folded, his head falling on his
breast.</p>

<p>Silence had fallen on them all. They all sat round the fire
buried in thought. Through the open window there came from the quay
beyond the hum of life in the open-air camp; the tramp of the
sentinels around it, the words of command from the drill-sergeant,
and through it all the moaning of the wind and the beating of the
sleet against the window-panes.</p>

<p>A whole world of wretchedness was expressed by those sounds!
Blakeney gave a quick, impatient sigh, and going to the window he
pushed it further open, and just then there came from afar the
muffled roll of drums, and from below the watchman's cry that
seemed such dire mockery:</p>

<p>"Sleep, citizens! Everything is safe and peaceful."</p>

<p>"Sound advice," said Blakeney lightly. "Shall we also go to
sleep? What say you all&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>He had with that sudden rapidity characteristic of his every
action, already thrown off the serious air which he had worn a
moment ago when giving instructions to Hastings. His usual
<i>débonnair</i> manner was on him once again, his laziness, his
careless <i>insouciance</i>. He was even at this moment deeply
engaged in flicking off a grain of dust from the immaculate Mechlin
ruff at his wrist. The heavy lids had fallen over the tell-tale
eyes as if weighted with fatigue, the mouth appeared ready for the
laugh which never was absent from it very long.</p>

<p>It was only Ffoulkes's devoted eyes that were sharp enough to
pierce the mask of light-hearted gaiety which enveloped the soul of
his leader at the present moment. He saw&mdash;for the first time
in all the years that he had known Blakeney&mdash;a frown across
the habitually smooth brow, and though the lips were parted for a
laugh, the lines round mouth and chin were hard and set.</p>

<p>With that intuition born of whole-hearted friendship Sir Andrew
guessed what troubled Percy. He had caught the look which the
latter had thrown on Armand, and knew that some explanation would
have to pass between the two men before they parted to-night.
Therefore he gave the signal for the breaking up of the
meeting.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more to say, is there, Blakeney?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, my good fellow, nothing," replied Sir Percy. "I do not know
how you all feel, but I am demmed fatigued."</p>

<p>"What about the rags for to-morrow?" queried Hastings.</p>

<p>"You know where to find them. In the room below. Ffoulkes has
the key. Wigs and all are there. But don't use false hair if you
can help it&mdash;it is apt to shift in a scrimmage."</p>

<p>He spoke jerkily, more curtly than was his wont. Hastings and
Tony thought that he was tired. They rose to say good night. Then
the three men went away together, Armand remaining behind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12. What Love Is</h2>

<p>"Well, now, Armand, what is it?" asked Blakeney, the moment the
footsteps of his friends had died away down the stone stairs, and
their voices had ceased to echo in the distance.</p>

<p>"You guessed, then, that there was...something?" said the
younger man, after a slight hesitation.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Armand rose, pushing the chair away from him with an impatient
nervy gesture. Burying his hands in the pockets of his breeches, he
began striding up and down the room, a dark, troubled expression in
his face, a deep frown between his eyes.</p>

<p>Blakeney had once more taken up his favourite position, sitting
on the corner of the table, his broad shoulders interposed between
the lamp and the rest of the room. He was apparently taking no
notice of Armand, but only intent on the delicate operation of
polishing his nails.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young man paused in his restless walk and stood in
front of his friend&mdash;an earnest, solemn, determined
figure.</p>

<p>"Blakeney," he said, "I cannot leave Paris to-morrow."</p>

<p>Sir Percy made no reply. He was contemplating the polish which
he had just succeeded in producing on his thumbnail.</p>

<p>"I must stay here for a while longer," continued Armand firmly.
"I may not be able to return to England for some weeks. You have
the three others here to help you in your enterprise outside Paris.
I am entirely at your service within the compass of its walls."</p>

<p>Still no comment from Blakeney, not a look from beneath the
fallen lids. Armand continued, with a slight tone of impatience
apparent in his voice:</p>

<p>"You must want some one to help you here on Sunday. I am
entirely at your service...here or anywhere in Paris...but I cannot
leave this city...at any rate, not just yet..."</p>

<p>Blakeney was apparently satisfied at last with the result of his
polishing operations. He rose, gave a slight yawn, and turned
toward the door.</p>

<p>"Good night, my dear fellow," he said pleasantly; "it is time we
were all abed. I am so demmed fatigued."</p>

<p>"Percy!" exclaimed the young man hotly.</p>

<p>"Eh? What is it?" queried the other lazily.</p>

<p>"You are not going to leave me like this&mdash;without a
word?"</p>

<p>"I have said a great many words, my good fellow. I have said
'good night,' and remarked that I was demmed fatigued."</p>

<p>He was standing beside the door which led to his bedroom, and
now he pushed it open with his hand.</p>

<p>"Percy, you cannot go and leave me like this!" reiterated Armand
with rapidly growing irritation.</p>

<p>"Like what, my dear fellow?" queried Sir Percy with
good-humoured impatience.</p>

<p>"Without a word&mdash;without a sign. What have I done that you
should treat me like a child, unworthy even of attention?"</p>

<p>Blakeney had turned back and was now facing him, towering above
the slight figure of the younger man. His face had lost none of its
gracious air, and beneath their heavy lids his eyes looked down not
unkindly on his friend.</p>

<p>"Would you have preferred it, Armand," he said quietly, "if I
had said the word that your ears have heard even though my lips
have not uttered it?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand," murmured Armand defiantly.</p>

<p>"What sign would you have had me make?" continued Sir Percy, his
pleasant voice falling calm and mellow on the younger man's
supersensitive consciousness: "That of branding you, Marguerite's
brother, as a liar and a cheat?"</p>

<p>"Blakeney!" retorted the other, as with flaming cheeks and
wrathful eyes he took a menacing step toward his friend; "had any
man but you dared to speak such words to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pray to God, Armand, that no man but I has the right to speak
them."</p>

<p>"You have no right."</p>

<p>"Every right, my friend. Do I not hold your oath?...Are you not
prepared to break it?"</p>

<p>"I'll not break my oath to you. I'll serve and help you in every
way you can command...my life I'll give to the cause...give me the
most dangerous&mdash;the most difficult task to perform...I'll do
it&mdash;I'll do it gladly."</p>

<p>"I have given you an over-difficult and dangerous task."</p>

<p>"Bah! To leave Paris in order to engage horses, while you and
the others do all the work. That is neither difficult nor
dangerous."</p>

<p>"It will be difficult for you, Armand, because your head is not
sufficiently cool to foresee serious eventualities and to prepare
against them. It is dangerous, because you are a man in love, and a
man in love is apt to run his head&mdash;and that of his
friends&mdash;blindly into a noose."</p>

<p>"Who told you that I was in love?"</p>

<p>"You yourself, my good fellow. Had you not told me so at the
outset," he continued, still speaking very quietly and deliberately
and never raising his voice, "I would even now be standing over
you, dog-whip in hand, to thrash you as a defaulting coward and a
perjurer...Bah!" he added with a return to his habitual
<i>bonhomie</i>, "I would no doubt even have lost my temper with
you. Which would have been purposeless and excessively bad form.
Eh?"</p>

<p>A violent retort had sprung to Armand's lips. But fortunately at
that very moment his eyes, glowing with anger, caught those of
Blakeney fixed with lazy good-nature upon his. Something of that
irresistible dignity which pervaded the whole personality of the
man checked Armand's hotheaded words on his lips.</p>

<p>"I cannot leave Paris to-morrow," he reiterated more calmly.</p>

<p>"Because you have arranged to see her again?"</p>

<p>"Because she saved my life to-day, and is herself in
danger."</p>

<p>"She is in no danger," said Blakeney simply, "since she saved
the life of my friend."</p>

<p>"Percy!"</p>

<p>The cry was wrung from Armand St. Just's very soul. Despite the
tumult of passion which was raging in his heart, he was conscious
again of the magnetic power which bound so many to this man's
service. The words he had said&mdash;simple though they
were&mdash;had sent a thrill through Armand's veins. He felt
himself disarmed. His resistance fell before the subtle strength of
an unbendable will; nothing remained in his heart but an
overwhelming sense of shame and of impotence.</p>

<p>He sank into a chair and rested his elbows on the table, burying
his face in his hands. Blakeney went up to him and placed a kindly
hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"The difficult task, Armand," he said gently.</p>

<p>"Percy, cannot you release me? She saved my life. I have not
thanked her yet."</p>

<p>"There will be time for thanks later, Armand. Just now over
yonder the son of kings is being done to death by savage
brutes."</p>

<p>"I would not hinder you if I stayed."</p>

<p>"God knows you have hindered us enough already."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"You say she saved your life...then you were in danger...Héron
and his spies have been on your track; your track leads to mine,
and I have sworn to save the Dauphin from the hands of thieves...A
man in love, Armand, is a deadly danger among us...Therefore at
daybreak you must leave Paris with Hastings on your difficult and
dangerous task."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?" retorted Armand.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," said Blakeney earnestly, "in that admirable
lexicon which the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel has compiled for
itself there is no such word as refuse."</p>

<p>"But if I do refuse?" persisted the other.</p>

<p>"You would be offering a tainted name and tarnished honour to
the woman you pretend to love."</p>

<p>"And you insist upon my obedience?"</p>

<p>"By the oath which I hold from you."</p>

<p>"But this is cruel&mdash;inhuman!"</p>

<p>"Honour, my good Armand, is often cruel and seldom human. He is
a godlike taskmaster, and we who call ourselves men are all of us
his slaves."</p>

<p>"The tyranny comes from you alone. You could release me an you
would."</p>

<p>"And to gratify the selfish desire of immature passion, you
would wish to see me jeopardise the life of those who place
infinite trust in me."</p>

<p>"God knows how you have gained their allegiance, Blakeney. To me
now you are selfish and callous."</p>

<p>"There is the difficult task you craved for, Armand," was all
the answer that Blakeney made to the taunt&mdash;"to obey a leader
whom you no longer trust."</p>

<p>But this Armand could not brook. He had spoken hotly,
impetuously, smarting under the discipline which thwarted his
desire, but his heart was loyal to the chief whom he had reverenced
for so long.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Percy," he said humbly; "I am distracted. I don't
think I quite realised what I was saying. I trust you, of course
... implicitly...and you need not even fear...I shall not break my
oath, though your orders now seem to me needlessly callous and
selfish...I will obey...you need not be afraid."</p>

<p>"I was not afraid of that, my good fellow."</p>

<p>"Of course, you do not understand...you cannot. To you, your
honour, the task which you have set yourself, has been your only
fetish...Love in its true sense does not exist for you...I see it
now...you do not know what it is to love."</p>

<p>Blakeney made no reply for the moment. He stood in the centre of
the room, with the yellow light of the lamp falling full now upon
his tall powerful frame, immaculately dressed in perfectly-tailored
clothes, upon his long, slender hands half hidden by filmy lace,
and upon his face, across which at this moment a heavy strand of
curly hair threw a curious shadow. At Armand's words his lips had
imperceptibly tightened, his eyes had narrowed as if they tried to
see something that was beyond the range of their focus.</p>

<p>Across the smooth brow the strange shadow made by the hair
seemed to find a reflex from within. Perhaps the reckless
adventurer, the careless gambler with life and liberty, saw through
the walls of this squalid room, across the wide, ice-bound river,
and beyond even the gloomy pile of buildings opposite, a cool,
shady garden at Richmond, a velvety lawn sweeping down to the
river's edge, a bower of clematis and roses, with a carved stone
seat half covered with moss. There sat an exquisitely beautiful
woman with great sad eyes fixed on the far-distant horizon. The
setting sun was throwing a halo of gold all round her hair, her
white hands were clasped idly on her lap.</p>

<p>She gazed out beyond the river, beyond the sunset, toward an
unseen bourne of peace and happiness, and her lovely face had in it
a look of utter hopelessness and of sublime self-abnegation. The
air was still. It was late autumn, and all around her the russet
leaves of beech and chestnut fell with a melancholy hush-sh-sh
about her feet.</p>

<p>She was alone, and from time to time heavy tears gathered in her
eyes and rolled slowly down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sigh escaped the man's tightly-pressed lips. With a
strange gesture, wholly unusual to him, he passed his hand right
across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mayhap you are right, Armand," he said quietly; "mayhap I do
not know what it is to love."</p>

<p>Armand turned to go. There was nothing more to be said. He knew
Percy well enough by now to realise the finality of his
pronouncements. His heart felt sore, but he was too proud to show
his hurt again to a man who did not understand. All thoughts of
disobedience he had put resolutely aside; he had never meant to
break his oath. All that he had hoped to do was to persuade Percy
to release him from it for awhile.</p>

<p>That by leaving Paris he risked to lose Jeanne he was quite
convinced, but it is nevertheless a true fact that in spite of this
he did not withdraw his love and trust from his chief. He was under
the influence of that same magnetism which enchained all his
comrades to the will of this man; and though his enthusiasm for the
great cause had somewhat waned, his allegiance to its leader was no
longer tottering.</p>

<p>But he would not trust himself to speak again on the
subject.</p>

<p>"I will find the others downstairs," was all he said, "and will
arrange with Hastings for to-morrow. Good night, Percy."</p>

<p>"Good night, my dear fellow. By the way, you have not told me
yet who she is."</p>

<p>"Her name is Jeanne Lange," said St. Just half reluctantly. He
had not meant to divulge his secret quite so fully as yet.</p>

<p>"The young actress at the Théâtre National?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"Only by name."</p>

<p>"She is beautiful, Percy, and she is an angel...Think of my
sister Marguerite...she, too, was an actress...Good night,
Percy."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>The two men grasped one another by the hand. Armand's eyes
proffered a last desperate appeal. But Blakeney's eyes were
impassive and unrelenting, and Armand with a quick sigh finally
took his leave.</p>

<p>For a long while after he had gone Blakeney stood silent and
motionless in the middle of the room. Armand's last words lingered
in his ear:</p>

<p>"Think of Marguerite!"</p>

<p>The walls had fallen away from around him&mdash;the window, the
river below, the Temple prison had all faded away, merged in the
chaos of his thoughts.</p>

<p>Now he was no longer in Paris; he heard nothing of the horrors
that even at this hour of the night were raging around him; he did
not hear the call of murdered victims, of innocent women and
children crying for help; he did not see the descendant of St.
Louis, with a red cap on his baby head, stamping on the
<i>fleur-de-lys</i>, and heaping insults on the memory of his
mother. All that had faded into nothingness.</p>

<p>He was in the garden at Richmond, and Marguerite was sitting on
the stone seat, with branches of the rambler roses twining
themselves in her hair.</p>

<p>He was sitting on the ground at her feet, his head pillowed in
her lap, lazily dreaming whilst at his feet the river wound its
graceful curves beneath overhanging willows and tall stately
elms.</p>

<p>A swan came sailing majestically down the stream, and
Marguerite, with idle, delicate hands, threw some crumbs of bread
into the water. Then she laughed, for she was quite happy, and anon
she stooped, and he felt the fragrance of her lips as she bent over
him and savoured the perfect sweetness of her caress. She was happy
because her husband was by her side. He had done with adventures,
with risking his life for others' sake. He was living only for
her.</p>

<p>The man, the dreamer, the idealist that lurked behind the
adventurous soul, lived an exquisite dream as he gazed upon that
vision. He closed his eyes so that it might last all the longer, so
that through the open window opposite he should not see the great
gloomy walls of the labyrinthine building packed to overflowing
with innocent men, women, and children waiting patiently and with a
smile on their lips for a cruel and unmerited death; so that he
should not see even through the vista of houses and of streets that
grim Temple prison far away, and the light in one of the tower
windows, which illumined the final martyrdom of a boy-king.</p>

<p>Thus he stood for fully five minutes, with eyes deliberately
closed and lips tightly set. Then the neighbouring tower-clock of
St. Germain l'Auxerrois slowly tolled the hour of midnight.
Blakeney woke from his dream. The walls of his lodging were once
more around him, and through the window the ruddy light of some
torch in the street below fought with that of the lamp.</p>

<p>He went deliberately up to the window and looked out into the
night. On the quay, a little to the left, the outdoor camp was just
breaking up for the night. The people of France in arms against
tyranny were allowed to put away their work for the day and to go
to their miserable homes to gather rest in sleep for the morrow. A
band of soldiers, rough and brutal in their movements, were
hustling the women and children. The little ones, weary, sleepy,
and cold, seemed too dazed to move. One woman had two little
children clinging to her skirts; a soldier suddenly seized one of
them by the shoulders and pushed it along roughly in front of him
to get it out of the way. The woman struck at the soldier in a
stupid, senseless, useless way, and then gathered her trembling
chicks under her wing, trying to look defiant.</p>

<p>In a moment she was surrounded. Two soldiers seized her, and two
more dragged the children away from her. She screamed and the
children cried, the soldiers swore and struck out right and left
with their bayonets. There was a general <i>mêlée</i>, calls of
agony rent the air, rough oaths drowned the shouts of the helpless.
Some women, panic-stricken, started to run.</p>

<p>And Blakeney from his window looked down upon the scene. He no
longer saw the garden at Richmond, the lazily-flowing river, the
bowers of roses; even the sweet face of Marguerite, sad and lonely,
appeared dim and far away.</p>

<p>He looked across the ice-bound river, past the quay where rough
soldiers were brutalising a number of wretched defenceless women,
to that grim Châtelet prison, where tiny lights shining here and
there behind barred windows told the sad tale of weary vigils, of
watches through the night, when dawn would bring martyrdom and
death.</p>

<p>And it was not Marguerite's blue eyes that beckoned to him now,
it was not her lips that called, but the wan face of a child with
matted curls hanging above a greasy forehead, and small hands
covered in grime that had once been fondled by a Queen.</p>

<p>The adventurer in him had chased away the dream.</p>

<p>"While there is life in me I'll cheat those brutes of prey," he
murmured.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13. Then Everything Was
Dark</h2>

<p>The night that Armand St. Just spent tossing about on a hard,
narrow bed was the most miserable, agonising one he had ever passed
in his life. A kind of fever ran through him, causing his teeth to
chatter and the veins in his temples to throb until he thought that
they must burst.</p>

<p>Physically he certainly was ill; the mental strain caused by two
great conflicting passions had attacked his bodily strength, and
whilst his brain and heart fought their battles together, his
aching limbs found no repose.</p>

<p>His love for Jeanne! His loyalty to the man to whom he owed his
life, and to whom he had sworn allegiance and implicit
obedience!</p>

<p>These super-acute feelings seemed to be tearing at his very
heartstrings, until he felt that he could no longer lie on the
miserable palliasse which in these squalid lodgings did duty for a
bed.</p>

<p>He rose long before daybreak, with tired back and burning eyes,
but unconscious of any pain save that which tore at his heart.</p>

<p>The weather, fortunately, was not quite so cold&mdash;a sudden
and very rapid thaw had set in; and when after a hurried toilet
Armand, carrying a bundle under his arm, emerged into the street,
the mild south wind struck pleasantly on his face.</p>

<p>It was then pitch dark. The street lamps had been extinguished
long ago, and the feeble January sun had not yet tinged with pale
colour the heavy clouds that hung over the sky.</p>

<p>The streets of the great city were absolutely deserted at this
hour. It lay, peaceful and still, wrapped in its mantle of gloom. A
thin rain was falling, and Armand's feet, as he began to descend
the heights of Montmartre, sank ankle deep in the mud of the road.
There was but scanty attempt at pavements in this outlying quarter
of the town, and Armand had much ado to keep his footing on the
uneven and intermittent stones that did duty for roads in these
parts. But this discomfort did not trouble him just now. One
thought&mdash;and one alone&mdash;was clear in his mind: he must
see Jeanne before he left Paris.</p>

<p>He did not pause to think how he could accomplish that at this
hour of the day. All he knew was that he must obey his chief, and
that he must see Jeanne. He would see her, explain to her that he
must leave Paris immediately, and beg her to make her preparations
quickly, so that she might meet him as soon as maybe, and accompany
him to England straight away.</p>

<p>He did not feel that he was being disloyal by trying to see
Jeanne. He had thrown prudence to the winds, not realising that his
imprudence would and did jeopardise, not only the success of his
chief's plans, but also his life and that of his friends. He had
before parting from Hastings last night arranged to meet him in the
neighbourhood of the Neuilly Gate at seven o'clock; it was only six
now. There was plenty of time for him to rouse the concierge at the
house of the Square du Roule, to see Jeanne for a few moments, to
slip into Madame Belhomme's kitchen, and there into the labourer's
clothes which he was carrying in the bundle under his arm, and to
be at the gate at the appointed hour.</p>

<p>The Square du Roule is shut off from the Rue St. Honoré, on
which it abuts, by tall iron gates, which a few years ago, when the
secluded little square was a fashionable quarter of the city, used
to be kept closed at night, with a watchman in uniform to intercept
midnight prowlers. Now these gates had been rudely torn away from
their sockets, the iron had been sold for the benefit of the
ever-empty Treasury, and no one cared if the homeless, the
starving, or the evil-doer found shelter under the porticoes of the
houses, from whence wealthy or aristocratic owners had long since
thought it wise to flee.</p>

<p>No one challenged Armand when he turned into the square, and
though the darkness was intense, he made his way fairly straight
for the house where lodged Mademoiselle Lange.</p>

<p>So far he had been wonderfully lucky. The foolhardiness with
which he had exposed his life and that of his friends by wandering
about the streets of Paris at this hour without any attempt at
disguise, though carrying one under his arm, had not met with the
untoward fate which it undoubtedly deserved. The darkness of the
night and the thin sheet of rain as it fell had effectually wrapped
his progress through the lonely streets in their beneficent mantle
of gloom; the soft mud below had drowned the echo of his footsteps.
If spies were on his track, as Jeanne had feared and Blakeney
prophesied, he had certainly succeeded in evading them.</p>

<p>He pulled the concierge's bell, and the latch of the outer door,
manipulated from within, duly sprang open in response. He entered,
and from the lodge the concierge's voice emerging, muffled from the
depths of pillows and blankets, challenged him with an oath
directed at the unseemliness of the hour.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Lange," said Armand boldly, as without hesitation
he walked quickly past the lodge making straight for the
stairs.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that from the concierge's room loud
vituperations followed him, but he took no notice of these; only a
short flight of stairs and one more door separated him from
Jeanne.</p>

<p>He did not pause to think that she would in all probability be
still in bed, that he might have some difficulty in rousing Madame
Belhomme, that the latter might not even care to admit him; nor did
he reflect on the glaring imprudence of his actions. He wanted to
see Jeanne, and she was the other side of that wall.</p>

<p>"<i>Hé</i>, citizen! <i>Holà!</i> Here! Curse you! Where are
you?" came in a gruff voice to him from below.</p>

<p>He had mounted the stairs, and was now on the landing just
outside Jeanne's door. He pulled the bell-handle, and heard the
pleasing echo of the bell that would presently wake Madame Belhomme
and bring her to the door.</p>

<p>"Citizen! <i>Holà!</i> Curse you for an aristo! What are you
doing there?"</p>

<p>The concierge, a stout, elderly man, wrapped in a blanket, his
feet thrust in slippers, and carrying a guttering tallow candle,
had appeared upon the landing.</p>

<p>He held the candle up so that its feeble flickering rays fell on
Armand's pale face, and on the damp cloak which fell away from his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" reiterated the concierge with
another oath from his prolific vocabulary.</p>

<p>"As you see, citizen," replied Armand politely, "I am ringing
Mademoiselle Lange's front door bell."</p>

<p>"At this hour of the morning?" queried the man with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I desire to see her."</p>

<p>"Then you have come to the wrong house, citizen," said the
concierge with a rude laugh.</p>

<p>"The wrong house? What do you mean?" stammered Armand, a little
bewildered.</p>

<p>"She is not here&mdash;<i>quoi!</i>" retorted the concierge, who
now turned deliberately on his heel. "Go and look for her, citizen;
it'll take you some time to find her."</p>

<p>He shuffled off in the direction of the stairs. Armand was
vainly trying to shake himself free from a sudden, an awful sense
of horror.</p>

<p>He gave another vigorous pull at the bell, then with one bound
he overtook the concierge, who was preparing to descend the stairs,
and gripped him peremptorily by the arm.</p>

<p>"Where is Mademoiselle Lange?" he asked.</p>

<p>His voice sounded quite strange in his own ear; his throat felt
parched, and he had to moisten his lips with his tongue before he
was able to speak.</p>

<p>"Arrested," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Arrested? When? Where? How?"</p>

<p>"When&mdash;late yesterday evening. Where?&mdash;here in her
room. How?&mdash;by the agents of the Committee of General
Security. She and the old woman! <i>Basta!</i> that's all I know.
Now I am going back to bed, and you clear out of the house. You are
making a disturbance, and I shall be reprimanded. I ask you, is
this a decent time for rousing honest patriots out of their morning
sleep?"</p>

<p>He shook his arm free from Armand's grasp and once more began to
descend.</p>

<p>Armand stood on the landing like a man who has been stunned by a
blow on the head. His limbs were paralysed. He could not for the
moment have moved or spoken if his life had depended on a sign or
on a word. His brain was reeling, and he had to steady himself with
his hand against the wall or he would have fallen headlong on the
floor. He had lived in a whirl of excitement for the past
twenty-four hours; his nerves during that time had been kept at
straining point. Passion, joy, happiness, deadly danger, and moral
fights had worn his mental endurance threadbare; want of proper
food and a sleepless night had almost thrown his physical balance
out of gear. This blow came at a moment when he was least able to
bear it.</p>

<p>Jeanne had been arrested! Jeanne was in the hands of those
brutes, whom he, Armand, had regarded yesterday with insurmountable
loathing! Jeanne was in prison&mdash;she was arrested&mdash;she
would be tried, condemned, and all because of him!</p>

<p>The thought was so awful that it brought him to the verge of
mania. He watched as in a dream the form of the concierge shuffling
his way down the oak staircase; his portly figure assumed
Gargantuan proportions, the candle which he carried looked like the
dancing flames of hell, through which grinning faces, hideous and
contortioned, mocked at him and leered.</p>

<p>Then suddenly everything was dark. The light had disappeared
round the bend of the stairs; grinning faces and ghoulish visions
vanished; he only saw Jeanne, his dainty, exquisite Jeanne, in the
hands of those brutes. He saw her as he had seen a year and a half
ago the victims of those bloodthirsty wretches being dragged before
a tribunal that was but a mockery of justice; he heard the quick
interrogatory, and the responses from her perfect lips, that
exquisite voice of hers veiled by tones of anguish. He heard the
condemnation, the rattle of the tumbril on the ill-paved
streets&mdash;saw her there with hands clasped together, her
eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>Great God! he was really going mad!</p>

<p>Like a wild creature driven forth he started to run down the
stairs, past the concierge, who was just entering his lodge, and
who now turned in surly anger to watch this man running away like a
lunatic or a fool, out by the front door and into the street. In a
moment he was out of the little square; then like a hunted hare he
still ran down the Rue St. Honoré, along its narrow, interminable
length. His hat had fallen from his head, his hair was wild all
round his face, the rain weighted the cloak upon his shoulders; but
still he ran.</p>

<p>His feet made no noise on the muddy pavement. He ran on and on,
his elbows pressed to his sides, panting, quivering, intent but
upon one thing&mdash;the goal which he had set himself to
reach.</p>

<p>Jeanne was arrested. He did not know where to look for her, but
he did know whither he wanted to go now as swiftly as his legs
would carry him.</p>

<p>It was still dark, but Armand St. Just was a born Parisian, and
he knew every inch of this quarter, where he and Marguerite had
years ago lived. Down the Rue St. Honoré, he had reached the bottom
of the interminably long street at last. He had kept just a
sufficiency of reason&mdash;or was it merely blind
instinct?&mdash;to avoid the places where the night patrols of the
National Guard might be on the watch. He avoided the Place du
Carrousel, also the quay, and struck sharply to his right until he
reached the façade of St. Germain l'Auxerrois.</p>

<p>Another effort; round the corner, and there was the house at
last. He was like the hunted creature now that has run to earth. Up
the two flights of stone stairs, and then the pull at the bell; a
moment of tense anxiety, whilst panting, gasping, almost choked
with the sustained effort and the strain of the past half-hour, he
leaned against the wall, striving not to fall.</p>

<p>Then the well-known firm step across the rooms beyond, the open
door, the hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>After that he remembered nothing more.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14. The Chief</h2>

<p>He had not actually fainted, but the exertion of that long run
had rendered him partially unconscious. He knew now that he was
safe, that he was sitting in Blakeney's room, and that something
hot and vivifying was being poured down his throat.</p>

<p>"Percy, they have arrested her!" he said, panting, as soon as
speech returned to his paralysed tongue.</p>

<p>"All right. Don't talk now. Wait till you are better."</p>

<p>With infinite care and gentleness Blakeney arranged some
cushions under Armand's head, turned the sofa towards the fire, and
anon brought his friend a cup of hot coffee, which the latter drank
with avidity.</p>

<p>He was really too exhausted to speak. He had contrived to tell
Blakeney, and now Blakeney knew, so everything would be all right.
The inevitable reaction was asserting itself; the muscles had
relaxed, the nerves were numbed, and Armand lay back on the sofa
with eyes half closed, unable to move, yet feeling his strength
gradually returning to him, his vitality asserting itself, all the
feverish excitement of the past twenty-four hours yielding at last
to a calmer mood.</p>

<p>Through his half-closed eyes he could see his brother-in-law
moving about the room. Blakeney was fully dressed. In a sleepy kind
of way Armand wondered if he had been to bed at all; certainly his
clothes set on him with their usual well-tailored perfection, and
there was no suggestion in his brisk step and alert movements that
he had passed a sleepless night.</p>

<p>Now he was standing by the open window. Armand, from where he
lay, could see his broad shoulders sharply outlined against the
grey background of the hazy winter dawn. A wan light was just
creeping up from the east over the city; the noises of the streets
below came distinctly to Armand's ear.</p>

<p>He roused himself with one vigorous effort from his lethargy,
feeling quite ashamed of himself and of this breakdown of his
nervous system. He looked with frank admiration on Sir Percy, who
stood immovable and silent by the window&mdash;a perfect tower of
strength, serene and impassive, yet kindly in distress.</p>

<p>"Percy," said the young man, "I ran all the way from the top of
the Rue St. Honoré. I was only breathless. I am quite all right.
May I tell you all about it?"</p>

<p>Without a word Blakeney closed the window and came across to the
sofa; he sat down beside Armand, and to all outward appearances he
was nothing now but a kind and sympathetic listener to a friend's
tale of woe. Not a line in his face or a look in his eyes betrayed
the thoughts of the leader who had been thwarted at the outset of a
dangerous enterprise, or of the man, accustomed to command, who had
been so flagrantly disobeyed.</p>

<p>Armand, unconscious of all save of Jeanne and of her immediate
need, put an eager hand on Percy's arm.</p>

<p>"Héron and his hell-hounds went back to her lodgings last
night," he said, speaking as if he were still a little out of
breath. "They hoped to get me, no doubt; not finding me there, they
took her. Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>It was the first time that he had put the whole terrible
circumstance into words, and it seemed to gain in reality by the
recounting. The agony of mind which he endured was almost
unbearable; he hid his face in his hands lest Percy should see how
terribly he suffered.</p>

<p>"I knew that," said Blakeney quietly. Armand looked up in
surprise.</p>

<p>"How? When did you know it?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Last night when you left me. I went down to the Square du
Roule. I arrived there just too late."</p>

<p>"Percy!" exclaimed Armand, whose pale face had suddenly flushed
scarlet, "you did that?&mdash;last night you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," interposed the other calmly; "had I not promised
you to keep watch over her? When I heard the news it was already
too late to make further inquiries, but when you arrived just now I
was on the point of starting out, in order to find out in what
prison Mademoiselle Lange is being detained. I shall have to go
soon, Armand, before the guard is changed at the Temple and the
Tuileries. This is the safest time, and God knows we are all of us
sufficiently compromised already."</p>

<p>The flush of shame deepened in St. Just's cheek. There had not
been a hint of reproach in the voice of his chief, and the eyes
which regarded him now from beneath the half-closed lids showed
nothing but lazy <i>bonhomie</i>.</p>

<p>In a moment now Armand realised all the harm which his
recklessness had done, was still doing to the work of the League.
Every one of his actions since his arrival in Paris two days ago
had jeopardised a plan or endangered a life: his friendship with de
Batz, his connection with Mademoiselle Lange, his visit to her
yesterday afternoon, the repetition of it this morning, culminating
in that wild run through the streets of Paris, when at any moment a
spy lurking round a corner might either have barred his way, or,
worse still, have followed him to Blakeney's door. Armand, without
a thought of any one save of his beloved, might easily this morning
have brought an agent of the Committee of General Security face to
face with his chief.</p>

<p>"Percy," he murmured, "can you ever forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw, man!" retorted Blakeney lightly; "there is naught to
forgive, only a great deal that should no longer be forgotten; your
duty to the others, for instance, your obedience, and your
honour."</p>

<p>"I was mad, Percy. Oh! if you only could understand what she
means to me!"</p>

<p>Blakeney laughed, his own light-hearted careless laugh, which so
often before now had helped to hide what he really felt from the
eyes of the indifferent, and even from those of his friends.</p>

<p>"No! no!" he said lightly, "we agreed last night, did we not?
that in matters of sentiment I am a cold-blooded fish. But will you
at any rate concede that I am a man of my word? Did I not pledge it
last night that Mademoiselle Lange would be safe? I foresaw her
arrest the moment I heard your story. I hoped that I might reach
her before that brute Héron's return; unfortunately he forestalled
me by less than half an hour. Mademoiselle Lange has been arrested,
Armand; but why should you not trust me on that account? Have we
not succeeded, I and the others, in worse cases than this one? They
mean no harm to Jeanne Lange," he added emphatically; "I give you
my word on that. They only want her as a decoy. It is you they
want. You through her, and me through you. I pledge you my honour
that she will be safe. You must try and trust me, Armand. It is
much to ask, I know, for you will have to trust me with what is
most precious in the world to you; and you will have to obey me
blindly, or I shall not be able to keep my word."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do?"</p>

<p>"Firstly, you must be outside Paris within the hour. Every
minute that you spend inside the city now is full of
danger&mdash;oh, no! not for you," added Blakeney, checking with a
good-humoured gesture Armand's words of protestation, "danger for
the others&mdash;and for our scheme tomorrow."</p>

<p>"How can I go to St. Germain, Percy, knowing that
she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is under my charge?" interposed the other calmly. "That should
not be so very difficult. Come," he added, placing a kindly hand on
the other's shoulder, "you shall not find me such an inhuman
monster after all. But I must think of the others, you see, and of
the child whom I have sworn to save. But I won't send you as far as
St. Germain. Go down to the room below and find a good bundle of
rough clothes that will serve you as a disguise, for I imagine that
you have lost those which you had on the landing or the stairs of
the house in the Square du Roule. In a tin box with the clothes
downstairs you will find the packet of miscellaneous certificates
of safety. Take an appropriate one, and then start out immediately
for Villette. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said Armand eagerly. "You want me to join Ffoulkes
and Tony."</p>

<p>"Yes! You'll find them probably unloading coal by the canal. Try
and get private speech with them as early as may be, and tell Tony
to set out at once for St. Germain, and to join Hastings there,
instead of you, whilst you take his place with Ffoulkes."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand; but how will Tony reach St. Germain?"</p>

<p>"La, my good fellow," said Blakeney gaily, "you may safely trust
Tony to go where I send him. Do you but do as I tell you, and leave
him to look after himself. And now," he added, speaking more
earnestly, "the sooner you get out of Paris the better it will be
for us all. As you see, I am only sending you to La Villette,
because it is not so far, but that I can keep in personal touch
with you. Remain close to the gates for an hour after nightfall. I
will contrive before they close to bring you news of Mademoiselle
Lange."</p>

<p>Armand said no more. The sense of shame in him deepened with
every word spoken by his chief. He felt how untrustworthy he had
been, how undeserving of the selfless devotion which Percy was
showing him even now. The words of gratitude died on his lips; he
knew that they would be unwelcome. These Englishmen were so devoid
of sentiment, he thought, and his brother-in-law, with all his
unselfish and heroic deeds, was, he felt, absolutely callous in
matters of the heart.</p>

<p>But Armand was a noble-minded man, and with the true sporting
instinct in him, despite the fact that he was a creature of nerves,
highly strung and imaginative. He could give ungrudging admiration
to his chief, even whilst giving himself up entirely to the
sentiment for Jeanne.</p>

<p>He tried to imbue himself with the same spirit that actuated my
Lord Tony and the other members of the League. How gladly would he
have chaffed and made senseless schoolboy jokes like those
which&mdash;in face of their hazardous enterprise and the dangers
which they all ran&mdash;had horrified him so much last night.</p>

<p>But somehow he knew that jokes from him would not ring true. How
could he smile when his heart was brimming over with his love for
Jeanne, and with solicitude on her account? He felt that Percy was
regarding him with a kind of indulgent amusement; there was a look
of suppressed merriment in the depths of those lazy blue eyes.</p>

<p>So he braced up his nerves, trying his best to look cool and
unconcerned, but he could not altogether hide from his friend the
burning anxiety which was threatening to break his heart.</p>

<p>"I have given you my word, Armand," said Blakeney in answer to
the unspoken prayer; "cannot you try and trust me&mdash;as the
others do?" Then with sudden transition he pointed to the map
behind him.</p>

<p>"Remember the gate of Villette, and the corner by the towpath.
Join Ffoulkes as soon as may be and send Tony on his way, and wait
for news of Mademoiselle Lange some time to-night."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Percy!" said Armand involuntarily.
"Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dear fellow. Slip on your disguise as quickly as
you can, and be out of the house in a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>He accompanied Armand through the ante-room, and finally closed
the door on him. Then he went back to his room and walked up to the
window, which he threw open to the humid morning air. Now that he
was alone the look of trouble on his face deepened to a dark,
anxious frown, and as he looked out across the river a sigh of
bitter impatience and disappointment escaped his lips.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15. The Gate Of La
Villette</h2>

<p>And now the shades of evening had long since yielded to those of
night. The gate of La Villette, at the northeast corner of the
city, was about to close. Armand, dressed in the rough clothes of a
labouring man, was leaning against a low wall at the angle of the
narrow street which abuts on the canal at its further end; from
this point of vantage he could command a view of the gate and of
the life and bustle around it.</p>

<p>He was dog-tired. After the emotions of the past twenty-four
hours, a day's hard manual toil to which he was unaccustomed had
caused him to ache in every limb. As soon as he had arrived at the
canal wharf in the early morning he had obtained the kind of casual
work that ruled about here, and soon was told off to unload a cargo
of coal which had arrived by barge overnight. He had set-to with a
will, half hoping to kill his anxiety by dint of heavy bodily
exertion. During the course of the morning he had suddenly become
aware of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and of Lord Anthony Dewhurst working
not far away from him, and as fine a pair of coalheavers as any
shipper could desire.</p>

<p>It was not very difficult in the midst of the noise and activity
that reigned all about the wharf for the three men to exchange a
few words together, and Armand soon communicated the chief's new
instructions to my Lord Tony, who effectually slipped away from his
work some time during the day. Armand did not even see him go, it
had all been so neatly done.</p>

<p>Just before five o'clock in the afternoon the labourers were
paid off. It was then too dark to continue work. Armand would have
liked to talk to Sir Andrew, if only for a moment. He felt lonely
and desperately anxious. He had hoped to tire out his nerves as
well as his body, but in this he had not succeeded. As soon as he
had given up his tools, his brain began to work again more busily
than ever. It followed Percy in his peregrinations through the
city, trying to discover where those brutes were keeping
Jeanne.</p>

<p>That task had suddenly loomed up before Armand's mind with all
its terrible difficulties. How could Percy&mdash;a marked man if
ever there was one&mdash;go from prison to prison to inquire about
Jeanne? The very idea seemed preposterous. Armand ought never to
have consented to such an insensate plan. The more he thought of
it, the more impossible did it seem that Blakeney could find
anything out.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was nowhere to be seen. St. Just wandered
about in the dark, lonely streets of this outlying quarter vainly
trying to find the friend in whom he could confide, who, no doubt,
would reassure him as to Blakeney's probable movements in Paris.
Then as the hour approached for the closing of the city gates
Armand took up his stand at an angle of the street from whence he
could see both the gate on one side of him and the thin line of the
canal intersecting the street at its further end.</p>

<p>Unless Percy came within the next five minutes the gates would
be closed and the difficulties of crossing the barrier would be
increased a hundredfold. The market gardeners with their covered
carts filed out of the gate one by one; the labourers on foot were
returning to their homes; there was a group of stonemasons, a few
road-makers, also a number of beggars, ragged and filthy, who
herded somewhere in the neighbourhood of the canal.</p>

<p>In every form, under every disguise, Armand hoped to discover
Percy. He could not stand still for very long, but strode up and
down the road that skirts the fortifications at this point.</p>

<p>There were a good many idlers about at this hour; some men who
had finished their work, and meant to spend an hour or so in one of
the drinking shops that abounded in the neighbourhood of the wharf;
others who liked to gather a small knot of listeners around them,
whilst they discoursed on the politics of the day, or rather raged
against the Convention, which was all made up of traitors to the
people's welfare.</p>

<p>Armand, trying manfully to play his part, joined one of the
groups that stood gaping round a street orator. He shouted with the
best of them, waved his cap in the air, and applauded or hissed in
unison with the majority. But his eyes never wandered for long away
from the gate whence Percy must come now at any moment&mdash;now or
not at all.</p>

<p>At what precise moment the awful doubt took birth in his mind
the young man could not afterwards have said. Perhaps it was when
he heard the roll of drums proclaiming the closing of the gates,
and witnessed the changing of the guard.</p>

<p>Percy had not come. He could not come now, and he (Armand) would
have the night to face without news of Jeanne. Something, of
course, had detained Percy; perhaps he had been unable to get
definite information about Jeanne; perhaps the information which he
had obtained was too terrible to communicate.</p>

<p>If only Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had been there, and Armand had had
some one to talk to, perhaps then he would have found sufficient
strength of mind to wait with outward patience, even though his
nerves were on the rack.</p>

<p>Darkness closed in around him, and with the darkness came the
full return of the phantoms that had assailed him in the house of
the Square du Roule when first he had heard of Jeanne's arrest. The
open place facing the gate had transformed itself into the Place de
la Révolution, the tall rough post that held a flickering oil lamp
had become the gaunt arm of the guillotine, the feeble light of the
lamp was the knife that gleamed with the reflection of a crimson
light.</p>

<p>And Armand saw himself, as in a vision, one of a vast and noisy
throng&mdash;they were all pressing round him so that he could not
move; they were brandishing caps and tricolour flags, also
pitchforks and scythes. He had seen such a crowd four years ago
rushing towards the Bastille. Now they were all assembled here
around him and around the guillotine.</p>

<p>Suddenly a distant rattle caught his subconscious ear: the
rattle of wheels on rough cobble-stones. Immediately the crowd
began to cheer and to shout; some sang the "<i>&Ccedil;a ira!</i>"
and others screamed:</p>

<p>"<i>Les aristos! à la lanterne! à mort! a mort! les
aristos!</i>"</p>

<p>He saw it all quite plainly, for the darkness had vanished, and
the vision was more vivid than even reality could have been. The
rattle of wheels grew louder, and presently the cart debouched on
the open place.</p>

<p>Men and women sat huddled up in the cart; but in the midst of
them a woman stood, and her eyes were fixed upon Armand. She wore
her pale-grey satin gown, and a white kerchief was folded across
her bosom. Her brown hair fell in loose soft curls all round her
head. She looked exactly like the exquisite cameo which Marguerite
used to wear. Her hands were tied with cords behind her back, but
between her fingers she held a small bunch of violets.</p>

<p>Armand saw it all. It was, of course, a vision, and he knew that
it was one, but he believed that the vision was prophetic. No
thought of the chief whom he had sworn to trust and to obey came to
chase away these imaginings of his fevered fancy. He saw Jeanne,
and only Jeanne, standing on the tumbril and being led to the
guillotine. Sir Andrew was not there, and Percy had not come.
Armand believed that a direct message had come to him from heaven
to save his beloved.</p>

<p>Therefore he forgot his promise&mdash;his oath; he forgot those
very things which the leader had entreated him to
remember&mdash;his duty to the others, his loyalty, his obedience.
Jeanne had first claim on him. It were the act of a coward to
remain in safety whilst she was in such deadly danger.</p>

<p>Now he blamed himself severely for having quitted Paris. Even
Percy must have thought him a coward for obeying quite so readily.
Maybe the command had been but a test of his courage, of the
strength of his love for Jeanne.</p>

<p>A hundred conjectures flashed through his brain; a hundred plans
presented themselves to his mind. It was not for Percy, who did not
know her, to save Jeanne or to guard her. That task was Armand's,
who worshipped her, and who would gladly die beside her if he
failed to rescue her from threatened death.</p>

<p>Resolution was not slow in coming. A tower clock inside the city
struck the hour of six, and still no sign of Percy.</p>

<p>Armand, his certificate of safety in his hand, walked boldly up
to the gate.</p>

<p>The guard challenged him, but he presented the certificate.
There was an agonising moment when the card was taken from him, and
he was detained in the guard-room while it was being examined by
the sergeant in command.</p>

<p>But the certificate was in good order, and Armand, covered in
coal-dust, with the perspiration streaming down his face, did
certainly not look like an aristocrat in disguise. It was never
very difficult to enter the great city; if one wished to put one's
head in the lion's mouth, one was welcome to do so; the difficulty
came when the lion thought fit to close his jaws.</p>

<p>Armand, after five minutes of tense anxiety, was allowed to
cross the barrier, but his certificate of safety was detained. He
would have to get another from the Committee of General Security
before he would be allowed to leave Paris again.</p>

<p>The lion had thought fit to close his jaws.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16. The Weary Search</h2>

<p>Blakeney was not at his lodgings when Armand arrived there that
evening, nor did he return, whilst the young man haunted the
precincts of St. Germain l'Auxerrois and wandered along the quays
hours and hours at a stretch, until he nearly dropped under the
portico of a house, and realised that if he loitered longer he
might lose consciousness completely, and be unable on the morrow to
be of service to Jeanne.</p>

<p>He dragged his weary footsteps back to his own lodgings on the
heights of Montmartre. He had not found Percy, he had no news of
Jeanne; it seemed as if hell itself could hold no worse tortures
than this intolerable suspense.</p>

<p>He threw himself down on the narrow palliasse and, tired nature
asserting herself, at last fell into a heavy, dreamless torpor,
like the sleep of a drunkard, deep but without the beneficent aid
of rest.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when he awoke. The pale light of a damp,
wintry morning filtered through the grimy panes of the window.
Armand jumped out of bed, aching of limb but resolute of mind.
There was no doubt that Percy had failed in discovering Jeanne's
whereabouts; but where a mere friend had failed a lover was more
likely to succeed.</p>

<p>The rough clothes which he had worn yesterday were the only ones
he had. They would, of course, serve his purpose better than his
own, which he had left at Blakeney's lodgings yesterday. In half an
hour he was dressed, looking a fairly good imitation of a labourer
out of work.</p>

<p>He went to a humble eating house of which he knew, and there,
having ordered some hot coffee with a hunk of bread, he set himself
to think.</p>

<p>It was quite a usual thing these days for relatives and friends
of prisoners to go wandering about from prison to prison to find
out where the loved ones happened to be detained. The prisons were
over full just now; convents, monasteries, and public institutions
had all been requisitioned by the Government for the housing of the
hundreds of so-called traitors who had been arrested on the barest
suspicion, or at the mere denunciation of an evil-wisher.</p>

<p>There were the Abbaye and the Luxembourg, the erstwhile convents
of the Visitation and the Sacré-Coeur, the cloister of the
Oratorians, the Salpêtrière, and the St. Lazare hospitals, and
there was, of course, the Temple, and, lastly, the Conciergerie, to
which those prisoners were brought whose trial would take place
within the next few days, and whose condemnation was practically
assured.</p>

<p>Persons under arrest at some of the other prisons did sometimes
come out of them alive, but the Conciergerie was only the
ante-chamber of the guillotine.</p>

<p>Therefore Armand's idea was to visit the Conciergerie first. The
sooner he could reassure himself that Jeanne was not in immediate
danger the better would he be able to endure the agony of that
heart-breaking search, that knocking at every door in the hope of
finding his beloved.</p>

<p>If Jeanne was not in the Conciergerie, then there might be some
hope that she was only being temporarily detained, and through
Armand's excited brain there had already flashed the thought that
mayhap the Committee of General Security would release her if he
gave himself up.</p>

<p>These thoughts, and the making of plans, fortified him mentally
and physically; he even made a great effort to eat and drink,
knowing that his bodily strength must endure if it was going to be
of service to Jeanne.</p>

<p>He reached the Quai de l'Horloge soon after nine. The grim,
irregular walls of the Châtelet and the house of Justice loomed
from out the mantle of mist that lay on the river banks. Armand
skirted the square clock-tower, and passed through the monumental
gateways of the house of Justice.</p>

<p>He knew that his best way to the prison would be through the
halls and corridors of the Tribunal, to which the public had access
whenever the court was sitting. The sittings began at ten, and
already the usual crowd of idlers were assembling&mdash;men and
women who apparently had no other occupation save to come day after
day to this theatre of horrors and watch the different acts of the
heartrending dramas that were enacted here with a kind of awful
monotony.</p>

<p>Armand mingled with the crowd that stood about the courtyard,
and anon moved slowly up the gigantic flight of stone steps,
talking lightly on indifferent subjects. There was quite a goodly
sprinkling of workingmen amongst this crowd, and Armand in his
toil-stained clothes attracted no attention.</p>

<p>Suddenly a word reached his ear&mdash;just a name flippantly
spoken by spiteful lips&mdash;and it changed the whole trend of his
thoughts. Since he had risen that morning he had thought of nothing
but of Jeanne, and&mdash;in connection with her&mdash;of Percy and
his vain quest of her. Now that name spoken by some one unknown
brought his mind back to more definite thoughts of his chief.</p>

<p>"Capet!" the name&mdash;intended as an insult, but actually
merely irrelevant&mdash;whereby the uncrowned little King of France
was designated by the revolutionary party.</p>

<p>Armand suddenly recollected that to-day was Sunday, the 19th of
January. He had lost count of days and of dates lately, but the
name, "Capet," had brought everything back: the child in the
Temple; the conference in Blakeney's lodgings; the plans for the
rescue of the boy. That was to take place to-day&mdash;Sunday, the
19th. The Simons would be moving from the Temple, at what hour
Blakeney did not know, but it would be today, and he would be
watching his opportunity.</p>

<p>Now Armand understood everything; a great wave of bitterness
swept over his soul. Percy had forgotten Jeanne! He was busy
thinking of the child in the Temple, and whilst Armand had been
eating out his heart with anxiety, the Scarlet Pimpernel, true only
to his mission, and impatient of all sentiment that interfered with
his schemes, had left Jeanne to pay with her life for the safety of
the uncrowned King.</p>

<p>But the bitterness did not last long; on the contrary, a kind of
wild exultation took its place. If Percy had forgotten, then Armand
could stand by Jeanne alone. It was better so! He would save the
loved one; it was his duty and his right to work for her sake.
Never for a moment did he doubt that he could save her, that his
life would be readily accepted in exchange for hers.</p>

<p>The crowd around him was moving up the monumental steps, and
Armand went with the crowd. It lacked but a few minutes to ten now;
soon the court would begin to sit. In the olden days, when he was
studying for the law, Armand had often wandered about at will along
the corridors of the house of Justice. He knew exactly where the
different prisons were situated about the buildings, and how to
reach the courtyards where the prisoners took their daily
exercise.</p>

<p>To watch those aristos who were awaiting trial and death taking
their recreation in these courtyards had become one of the sights
of Paris. Country cousins on a visit to the city were brought
hither for entertainment. Tall iron gates stood between the public
and the prisoners, and a row of sentinels guarded these gates; but
if one was enterprising and eager to see, one could glue one's nose
against the ironwork and watch the <i>ci-devant</i> aristocrats in
threadbare clothes trying to cheat their horror of death by acting
a farce of light-heartedness which their wan faces and tear-dimmed
eyes effectually belied.</p>

<p>All this Armand knew, and on this he counted. For a little while
he joined the crowd in the Salle des Pas Perdus, and wandered idly
up and down the majestic colonnaded hall. He even at one time
formed part of the throng that watched one of those quick tragedies
that were enacted within the great chamber of the court. A number
of prisoners brought in, in a batch; hurried interrogations,
interrupted answers, a quick indictment, monstrous in its flaring
injustice, spoken by Foucquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor, and
listened to in all seriousness by men who dared to call themselves
judges of their fellows.</p>

<p>The accused had walked down the Champs Elysées without wearing a
tricolour cockade; the other had invested some savings in an
English industrial enterprise; yet another had sold public funds,
causing them to depreciate rather suddenly in the market!</p>

<p>Sometimes from one of these unfortunates led thus wantonly to
butchery there would come an excited protest, or from a woman
screams of agonised entreaty. But these were quickly silenced by
rough blows from the butt-ends of muskets, and
condemnations&mdash;wholesale sentences of death&mdash;were quickly
passed amidst the cheers of the spectators and the howls of
derision from infamous jury and judge.</p>

<p>Oh! the mockery of it all&mdash;the awful, the hideous ignominy,
the blot of shame that would forever sully the historic name of
France. Armand, sickened with horror, could not bear more than a
few minutes of this monstrous spectacle. The same fate might even
now be awaiting Jeanne. Among the next batch of victims to this
sacrilegious butchery he might suddenly spy his beloved with her
pale face and cheeks stained with her tears.</p>

<p>He fled from the great chamber, keeping just a sufficiency of
presence of mind to join a knot of idlers who were drifting
leisurely towards the corridors. He followed in their wake and soon
found himself in the long Galerie des Prisonniers, along the
flagstones of which two days ago de Batz had followed his guide
towards the lodgings of Héron.</p>

<p>On his left now were the arcades shut off from the courtyard
beyond by heavy iron gates. Through the ironwork Armand caught
sight of a number of women walking or sitting in the courtyard. He
heard a man next to him explaining to his friend that these were
the female prisoners who would be brought to trial that day, and he
felt that his heart must burst at the thought that mayhap Jeanne
would be among them.</p>

<p>He elbowed his way cautiously to the front rank. Soon he found
himself beside a sentinel who, with a good-humoured jest, made way
for him that he might watch the aristos. Armand leaned against the
grating, and his every sense was concentrated in that of sight.</p>

<p>At first he could scarcely distinguish one woman from another
amongst the crowd that thronged the courtyard, and the close
ironwork hindered his view considerably. The women looked almost
like phantoms in the grey misty air, gliding slowly along with
noiseless tread on the flag-stones.</p>

<p>Presently, however, his eyes, which mayhap were somewhat dim
with tears, became more accustomed to the hazy grey light and the
moving figures that looked so like shadows. He could distinguish
isolated groups now, women and girls sitting together under the
colonnaded arcades, some reading, others busy, with trembling
fingers, patching and darning a poor, torn gown. Then there were
others who were actually chatting and laughing together,
and&mdash;oh, the pity of it! the pity and the shame!&mdash;a few
children, shrieking with delight, were playing hide and seek in and
out amongst the columns.</p>

<p>And, between them all, in and out like the children at play,
unseen, yet familiar to all, the spectre of Death, scythe and
hour-glass in hand, wandered, majestic and sure.</p>

<p>Armand's very soul was in his eyes. So far he had not yet caught
sight of his beloved, and slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;a ray of
hope was filtering through the darkness of his despair.</p>

<p>The sentinel, who had stood aside for him, chaffed him for his
intentness.</p>

<p>"Have you a sweetheart among these aristos, citizen?" he asked.
"You seem to be devouring them with your eyes."</p>

<p>Armand, with his rough clothes soiled with coal-dust, his face
grimy and streaked with sweat, certainly looked to have but little
in common with the <i>ci-devant</i> aristos who formed the hulk of
the groups in the courtyard. He looked up; the soldier was
regarding him with obvious amusement, and at sight of Armand's
wild, anxious eyes he gave vent to a coarse jest.</p>

<p>"Have I made a shrewd guess, citizen?" he said. "Is she among
that lot?"</p>

<p>"I do not know where she is," said Armand almost
involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you find out?" queried the soldier.</p>

<p>The man was not speaking altogether unkindly. Armand, devoured
with the maddening desire to know, threw the last fragment of
prudence to the wind. He assumed a more careless air, trying to
look as like a country bumpkin in love as he could.</p>

<p>"I would like to find out," he said, "but I don't know where to
inquire. My sweetheart has certainly left her home," he added
lightly; "some say that she has been false to me, but I think that,
mayhap, she has been arrested."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you gaby," said the soldier good-humouredly, "go
straight to La Tournelle; you know where it is?"</p>

<p>Armand knew well enough, but thought it more prudent to keep up
the air of the ignorant lout.</p>

<p>"Straight down that first corridor on your right," explained the
other, pointing in the direction which he had indicated, "you will
find the <i>guichet</i> of La Tournelle exactly opposite to you.
Ask the concierge for the register of female prisoners&mdash;every
freeborn citizen of the Republic has the right to inspect prison
registers. It is a new decree framed for safeguarding the liberty
of the people. But if you do not press half a livre in the hand of
the concierge," he added, speaking confidentially, "you will find
that the register will not be quite ready for your inspection."</p>

<p>"Half a livre!" exclaimed Armand, striving to play his part to
the end. "How can a poor devil of a labourer have half a livre to
give away?"</p>

<p>"Well! a few sous will do in that case; a few sous are always
welcome these hard times."</p>

<p>Armand took the hint, and as the crowd had drifted away
momentarily to a further portion of the corridor, he contrived to
press a few copper coins into the hand of the obliging soldier.</p>

<p>Of course, he knew his way to La Tournelle, and he would have
covered the distance that separated him from the <i>guichet</i>
there with steps flying like the wind, but, commending himself for
his own prudence, he walked as slowly as he could along the
interminable corridor, past the several minor courts of justice,
and skirting the courtyard where the male prisoners took their
exercise.</p>

<p>At last, having struck sharply to his left and ascended a short
flight of stairs, he found himself in front of the
<i>guichet</i>&mdash;a narrow wooden box, wherein the clerk in
charge of the prison registers sat nominally at the disposal of the
citizens of this free republic.</p>

<p>But to Armand's almost overwhelming chagrin he found the place
entirely deserted. The <i>guichet</i> was closed down; there was
not a soul in sight. The disappointment was doubly keen, coming as
it did in the wake of hope that had refused to be gainsaid. Armand
himself did not realise how sanguine he had been until he
discovered that he must wait and wait again&mdash;wait for hours,
all day mayhap, before he could get definite news of Jeanne.</p>

<p>He wandered aimlessly in the vicinity of that silent, deserted,
cruel spot, where a closed trapdoor seemed to shut off all his
hopes of a speedy sight of Jeanne. He inquired of the first
sentinels whom he came across at what hour the clerk of the
registers would be back at his post; the soldiers shrugged their
shoulders and could give no information. Then began Armand's
aimless wanderings round La Tournelle, his fruitless inquiries, his
wild, excited search for the hide-bound official who was keeping
from him the knowledge of Jeanne.</p>

<p>He went back to his sentinel well-wisher by the women's
courtyard, but found neither consolation nor encouragement
there.</p>

<p>"It is not the hour&mdash;<i>quoi?</i>" the soldier remarked
with laconic philosophy.</p>

<p>It apparently was not the hour when the prison registers were
placed at the disposal of the public. After much fruitless inquiry,
Armand at last was informed by a <i>bon bourgeois</i>, who was
wandering about the house of Justice and who seemed to know its
multifarious rules, that the prison registers all over Paris could
only be consulted by the public between the hours of six and seven
in the evening.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to wait. Armand, whose temples were
throbbing, who was footsore, hungry, and wretched, could gain
nothing by continuing his aimless wanderings through the
labyrinthine building. For close upon another hour he stood with
his face glued against the ironwork which separated him from the
female prisoners' courtyard. Once it seemed to him as if from its
further end he caught the sound of that exquisitely melodious voice
which had rung forever in his ear since that memorable evening when
Jeanne's dainty footsteps had first crossed the path of his
destiny. He strained his eyes to look in the direction whence the
voice had come, but the centre of the courtyard was planted with a
small garden of shrubs, and Armand could not see across it. At
last, driven forth like a wandering and lost soul, he turned back
and out into the streets. The air was mild and damp. The sharp thaw
had persisted through the day, and a thin, misty rain was falling
and converting the ill-paved roads into seas of mud.</p>

<p>But of this Armand was wholly unconscious. He walked along the
quay holding his cap in his hand, so that the mild south wind
should cool his burning forehead.</p>

<p>How he contrived to kill those long, weary hours he could not
afterwards have said. Once he felt very hungry, and turned almost
mechanically into an eating-house, and tried to eat and drink. But
most of the day he wandered through the streets, restlessly,
unceasingly, feeling neither chill nor fatigue. The hour before six
o'clock found him on the Quai de l'Horloge in the shadow of the
great towers of the Hall of Justice, listening for the clang of the
clock that would sound the hour of his deliverance from this
agonising torture of suspense.</p>

<p>He found his way to La Tournelle without any hesitation. There
before him was the wooden box, with its <i>guichet</i> open at
last, and two stands upon its ledge, on which were placed two huge
leather-bound books.</p>

<p>Though Armand was nearly an hour before the appointed time, he
saw when he arrived a number of people standing round the
<i>guichet</i>. Two soldiers were there keeping guard and forcing
the patient, long-suffering inquirers to stand in a queue, each
waiting his or her turn at the books.</p>

<p>It was a curious crowd that stood there, in single file, as if
waiting at the door of the cheaper part of a theatre; men in
substantial cloth clothes, and others in ragged blouse and
breeches; there were a few women, too, with black shawls on their
shoulders and kerchiefs round their wan, tear-stained faces.</p>

<p>They were all silent and absorbed, submissive under the rough
handling of the soldiery, humble and deferential when anon the
clerk of the registers entered his box, and prepared to place those
fateful books at the disposal of those who had lost a loved
one&mdash;father, brother, mother, or wife&mdash;and had come to
search through those cruel pages.</p>

<p>From inside his box the clerk disputed every inquirer's right to
consult the books; he made as many difficulties as he could,
demanding the production of certificates of safety, or permits from
the section. He was as insolent as he dared, and Armand from where
he stood could see that a continuous if somewhat thin stream of
coppers flowed from the hands of the inquirers into those of the
official.</p>

<p>It was quite dark in the passage where the long queue continued
to swell with amazing rapidity. Only on the ledge in front of the
<i>guichet</i> there was a guttering tallow candle at the disposal
of the inquirers.</p>

<p>Now it was Armand's turn at last. By this time his heart was
beating so strongly and so rapidly that he could not have trusted
himself to speak. He fumbled in his pocket, and without unnecessary
preliminaries he produced a small piece of silver, and pushed it
towards the clerk, then he seized on the register marked
"<i>Femmes</i>" with voracious avidity.</p>

<p>The clerk had with stolid indifference pocketed the half-livre;
he looked on Armand over a pair of large bone-rimmed spectacles,
with the air of an old hawk that sees a helpless bird and yet is
too satiated to eat. He was apparently vastly amused at Armand's
trembling hands, and the clumsy, aimless way with which he fingered
the book and held up the tallow candle.</p>

<p>"What date?" he asked curtly in a piping voice.</p>

<p>"What date?" reiterated Armand vaguely.</p>

<p>"What day and hour was she arrested?" said the man, thrusting
his beak-like nose closer to Armand's face. Evidently the piece of
silver had done its work well; he meant to be helpful to this
country lout.</p>

<p>"On Friday evening," murmured the young man.</p>

<p>The clerk's hands did not in character gainsay the rest of his
appearance; they were long and thin, with nails that resembled the
talons of a hawk. Armand watched them fascinated as from above they
turned over rapidly the pages of the book; then one long, grimy
finger pointed to a row of names down a column.</p>

<p>"If she is here," said the man curtly, "her name should be
amongst these."</p>

<p>Armand's vision was blurred. He could scarcely see. The row of
names was dancing a wild dance in front of his eyes; perspiration
stood out on his forehead, and his breath came in quick, stertorous
gasps.</p>

<p>He never knew afterwards whether he actually saw Jeanne's name
there in the book, or whether his fevered brain was playing his
aching senses a cruel and mocking trick. Certain it is that
suddenly amongst a row of indifferent names hers suddenly stood
clearly on the page, and to him it seemed as if the letters were
writ out in blood.</p>

<p class="letter">582. Belhomme, Louise, aged sixty.
Discharged.</p>

<p>And just below, the other entry:</p>

<p class="letter">583. Lange, Jeanne, aged twenty, actress. Square
du Roule.</p>

<p class="letter">No.5. Suspected of harbouring traitors and
ci-devants. Transferred 29th Nivose to the Temple, cell 29.</p>

<p>He saw nothing more, for suddenly it seemed to him as if some
one held a vivid scarlet veil in front of his eyes, whilst a
hundred claw-like hands were tearing at his heart and at his
throat.</p>

<p>"Clear out now! it is my turn&mdash;what? Are you going to stand
there all night?"</p>

<p>A rough voice seemed to be speaking these words; rough hands
apparently were pushing him out of the way, and some one snatched
the candle out of his hand; but nothing was real. He stumbled over
a corner of a loose flagstone, and would have fallen, but something
seemed to catch hold of him and to lead him away for a little
distance, until a breath of cold air blew upon his face.</p>

<p>This brought him back to his senses.</p>

<p>Jeanne was a prisoner in the Temple; then his place was in the
prison of the Temple, too. It could not be very difficult to run
one's head into the noose that caught so many necks these days. A
few cries of "<i>Vive le roi!</i>" or "<i>&Agrave; bas la
république!</i>" and more than one prison door would gape
invitingly to receive another guest.</p>

<p>The hot blood had rushed into Armand's head. He did not see
clearly before him, nor did he hear distinctly. There was a buzzing
in his ears as of myriads of mocking birds' wings, and there was a
veil in front of his eyes&mdash;a veil through which he saw faces
and forms flitting ghost-like in the gloom, men and women jostling
or being jostled, soldiers, sentinels; then long, interminable
corridors, more crowd and more soldiers, winding stairs, courtyards
and gates; finally the open street, the quay, and the river
beyond.</p>

<p>An incessant hammering went on in his temples, and that veil
never lifted from before his eyes. Now it was lurid and red, as if
stained with blood; anon it was white like a shroud but it was
always there.</p>

<p>Through it he saw the Pont-au-Change, which he crossed, then far
down on the Quai de l'Ecole to the left the corner house behind St.
Germain l'Auxerrois, where Blakeney lodged&mdash;Blakeney, who for
the sake of a stranger had forgotten all about his comrade and
Jeanne.</p>

<p>Through it he saw the network of streets which separated him
from the neighbourhood of the Temple, the gardens of ruined
habitations, the closely-shuttered and barred windows of ducal
houses, then the mean streets, the crowded drinking bars, the
tumble-down shops with their dilapidated awnings.</p>

<p>He saw with eyes that did not see, heard the tumult of daily
life round him with ears that did not hear. Jeanne was in the
Temple prison, and when its grim gates closed finally for the
night, he&mdash;Armand, her chevalier, her lover, her
defender&mdash;would be within its walls as near to cell No. 29 as
bribery, entreaty, promises would help him to attain.</p>

<p>Ah! there at last loomed the great building, the pointed
bastions cut through the surrounding gloom as with a sable
knife.</p>

<p>Armand reached the gate; the sentinels challenged him; he
replied:</p>

<p>"<i>Vive le roi!</i>" shouting wildly like one who is drunk.</p>

<p>He was hatless, and his clothes were saturated with moisture. He
tried to pass, but crossed bayonets barred the way. Still he
shouted:</p>

<p>"<i>Vive le roi!</i>" and "<i>A&Agrave; bas la
république!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Allons!</i> the fellow is drunk!" said one of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Armand fought like a madman; he wanted to reach that gate. He
shouted, he laughed, and he cried, until one of the soldiers in a
fit of rage struck him heavily on the head.</p>

<p>Armand fell backwards, stunned by the blow; his foot slipped on
the wet pavement. Was he indeed drunk, or was he dreaming? He put
his hand up to his forehead; it was wet, but whether with the rain
or with blood he did not know; but for the space of one second he
tried to collect his scattered wits.</p>

<p>"Citizen St. Just!" said a quiet voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>Then, as he looked round dazed, feeling a firm, pleasant grip on
his arm, the same quiet voice continued calmly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not remember me, citizen St. Just. I had not the
honour of the same close friendship with you as I had with your
charming sister. My name is Chauvelin. Can I be of any service to
you?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17. Chauvelin</h2>

<p>Chauvelin! The presence of this man here at this moment made the
events of the past few days seem more absolutely like a dream.
Chauvelin!&mdash;the most deadly enemy he, Armand, and his sister
Marguerite had in the world. Chauvelin!&mdash;the evil genius that
presided over the Secret Service of the Republic.
Chauvelin&mdash;the aristocrat turned revolutionary, the diplomat
turned spy, the baffled enemy of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>He stood there vaguely outlined in the gloom by the feeble rays
of an oil lamp fixed into the wall just above. The moisture on his
sable clothes glistened in the flickering light like a thin veil of
crystal; it clung to the rim of his hat, to the folds of his cloak;
the ruffles at his throat and wrist hung limp and soiled.</p>

<p>He had released Armand's arm, and held his hands now underneath
his cloak; his pale, deep-set eyes rested gravely on the younger
man's face.</p>

<p>"I had an idea, somehow," continued Chauvelin calmly, "that you
and I would meet during your sojourn in Paris. I heard from my
friend Héron that you had been in the city; he, unfortunately, lost
your track almost as soon as he had found it, and I, too, had begun
to fear that our mutual and ever enigmatical friend, the Scarlet
Pimpernel, had spirited you away, which would have been a great
disappointment to me."</p>

<p>Now he once more took hold of Armand by the elbow, but quite
gently, more like a comrade who is glad to have met another, and is
preparing to enjoy a pleasant conversation for a while. He led the
way back to the gate, the sentinel saluting at sight of the
tricolour scarf which was visible underneath his cloak. Under the
stone rampart Chauvelin paused.</p>

<p>It was quiet and private here. The group of soldiers stood at
the further end of the archway, but they were out of hearing, and
their forms were only vaguely discernible in the surrounding
darkness.</p>

<p>Armand had followed his enemy mechanically like one bewitched
and irresponsible for his actions. When Chauvelin paused he too
stood still, not because of the grip on his arm, but because of
that curious numbing of his will.</p>

<p>Vague, confused thoughts were floating through his brain, the
most dominant one among them being that Fate had effectually
ordained everything for the best. Here was Chauvelin, a man who
hated him, who, of course, would wish to see him dead. Well, surely
it must be an easier matter now to barter his own life for that of
Jeanne; she had only been arrested on suspicion of harbouring him,
who was a known traitor to the Republic; then, with his capture and
speedy death, her supposed guilt would, he hoped, be forgiven.
These people could have no ill-will against her, and actors and
actresses were always leniently dealt with when possible. Then
surely, surely, he could serve Jeanne best by his own arrest and
condemnation, than by working to rescue her from prison.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Chauvelin shook the damp from off his cloak,
talking all the time in his own peculiar, gently ironical
manner.</p>

<p>"Lady Blakeney?" he was saying&mdash;"I hope that she is
well!"</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," murmured Armand mechanically.</p>

<p>"And my dear friend, Sir Percy Blakeney? I had hoped to meet him
in Paris. Ah! but no doubt he has been busy very busy; but I live
in hopes&mdash;I live in hopes. See how kindly Chance has treated
me," he continued in the same bland and mocking tones. "I was
taking a stroll in these parts, scarce hoping to meet a friend,
when, passing the postern-gate of this charming hostelry, whom
should I see but my amiable friend St. Just striving to gain
admission. But, la! here am I talking of myself, and I am not
re-assured as to your state of health. You felt faint just now, did
you not? The air about this building is very dank and close. I hope
you feel better now. Command me, pray, if I can be of service to
you in any way."</p>

<p>Whilst Chauvelin talked he had drawn Armand after him into the
lodge of the concierge. The young man now made a great effort to
pull himself vigorously together and to steady his nerves.</p>

<p>He had his wish. He was inside the Temple prison now, not far
from Jeanne, and though his enemy was older and less vigorous than
himself, and the door of the concierge's lodge stood wide open, he
knew that he was indeed as effectually a prisoner already as if the
door of one of the numerous cells in this gigantic building had
been bolted and barred upon him.</p>

<p>This knowledge helped him to recover his complete presence of
mind. No thought of fighting or trying to escape his fate entered
his head for a moment. It had been useless probably, and
undoubtedly it was better so. If he only could see Jeanne, and
assure himself that she would be safe in consequence of his own
arrest, then, indeed, life could hold no greater happiness for
him.</p>

<p>Above all now he wanted to be cool and calculating, to curb the
excitement which the Latin blood in him called forth at every
mention of the loved one's name. He tried to think of Percy, of his
calmness, his easy banter with an enemy; he resolved to act as
Percy would act under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Firstly, he steadied his voice, and drew his well-knit, slim
figure upright. He called to mind all his friends in England, with
their rigid manners, their impassiveness in the face of trying
situations. There was Lord Tony, for instance, always ready with
some boyish joke, with boyish impertinence always hovering on his
tongue. Armand tried to emulate Lord Tony's manner, and to borrow
something of Percy's calm impudence.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin," he said, as soon as he felt quite sure of
the steadiness of his voice and the calmness of his manner, "I
wonder if you are quite certain that that light grip which you have
on my arm is sufficient to keep me here walking quietly by your
side instead of knocking you down, as I certainly feel inclined to
do, for I am a younger, more vigorous man than you."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Chauvelin, who made pretence to ponder over this
difficult problem; "like you, citizen St. Just, I
wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It could easily be done, you know."</p>

<p>"Fairly easily," rejoined the other; "but there is the guard; it
is numerous and strong in this building, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The gloom would help me; it is dark in the corridors, and a
desperate man takes risks, remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite so! And you, citizen St. Just, are a desperate man just
now."</p>

<p>"My sister Marguerite is not here, citizen Chauvelin. You cannot
barter my life for that of your enemy."</p>

<p>"No! no! no!" rejoined Chauvelin blandly; "not for that of my
enemy, I know, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Armand caught at his words like a drowning man at a reed.</p>

<p>"For hers!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"For hers?" queried the other with obvious puzzlement.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Lange," continued Armand with all the egoistic
ardour of the lover who believes that the attention of the entire
world is concentrated upon his beloved.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Lange! You will set her free now that I am in your
power."</p>

<p>Chauvelin smiled, his usual suave, enigmatical smile.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" he said. "Mademoiselle Lange. I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"Forgotten, man?&mdash;forgotten that those murderous dogs have
arrested her?&mdash;the best, the purest, this vile, degraded
country has ever produced. She sheltered me one day just for an
hour. I am a traitor to the Republic&mdash;I own it. I'll make full
confession; but she knew nothing of this. I deceived her; she is
quite innocent, you understand? I'll make full confession, but you
must set her free."</p>

<p>He had gradually worked himself up again to a state of feverish
excitement. Through the darkness which hung about in this small
room he tried to peer in Chauvelin's impassive face.</p>

<p>"Easy, easy, my young friend," said the other placidly; "you
seem to imagine that I have something to do with the arrest of the
lady in whom you take so deep an interest. You forget that now I am
but a discredited servant of the Republic whom I failed to serve in
her need. My life is only granted me out of pity for my efforts,
which were genuine if not successful. I have no power to set any
one free."</p>

<p>"Nor to arrest me now, in that case!" retorted Armand.</p>

<p>Chauvelin paused a moment before he replied with a deprecating
smile:</p>

<p>"Only to denounce you, perhaps. I am still an agent of the
Committee of General Security."</p>

<p>"Then all is for the best!" exclaimed St. Just eagerly. "You
shall denounce me to the Committee. They will be glad of my arrest,
I assure you. I have been a marked man for some time. I had
intended to evade arrest and to work for the rescue of Mademoiselle
Lange; but I will give up all thought of that&mdash;I will deliver
myself into your hands absolutely; nay, more, I will give you my
most solemn word of honour that not only will I make no attempt at
escape, but that I will not allow any one to help me to do so. I
will be a passive and willing prisoner if you, on the other hand,
will effect Mademoiselle Lange's release."</p>

<p>"H'm!" mused Chauvelin again, "it sounds feasible."</p>

<p>"It does! it does!" rejoined Armand, whose excitement was at
fever-pitch. "My arrest, my condemnation, my death, will be of vast
deal more importance to you than that of a young and innocent girl
against whom unlikely charges would have to be tricked up, and
whose acquittal mayhap public feeling might demand. As for me, I
shall be an easy prey; my known counter-revolutionary principles,
my sister's marriage with a foreigner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your connection with the Scarlet Pimpernel," suggested
Chauvelin blandly.</p>

<p>"Quite so. I should not defend myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And your enigmatical friend would not attempt your rescue.
<i>C'est entendu</i>," said Chauvelin with his wonted blandness.
"Then, my dear, enthusiastic young friend, shall we adjourn to the
office of my colleague, citizen Héron, who is chief agent of the
Committee of General Security, and will receive your&mdash;did you
say confession?&mdash;and note the conditions under which you place
yourself absolutely in the hands of the Public Prosecutor and
subsequently of the executioner. Is that it?"</p>

<p>Armand was too full of schemes, too full of thoughts of Jeanne
to note the tone of quiet irony with which Chauvelin had been
speaking all along. With the unreasoning egoism of youth he was
quite convinced that his own arrest, his own affairs were as
important to this entire nation in revolution as they were to
himself. At moments like these it is difficult to envisage a
desperate situation clearly, and to a young man in love the fate of
the beloved never seems desperate whilst he himself is alive and
ready for every sacrifice for her sake. "My life for hers" is the
sublime if often foolish battle-cry that has so often resulted in
wholesale destruction. Armand at this moment, when he fondly
believed that he was making a bargain with the most astute, most
unscrupulous spy this revolutionary Government had in its
pay&mdash;Armand just then had absolutely forgotten his chief, his
friends, the league of mercy and help to which he belonged.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm and the spirit of self-sacrifice were carrying him
away. He watched his enemy with glowing eyes as one who looks on
the arbiter of his fate.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, without another word, beckoned to him to follow. He
led the way out of the lodge, then, turning sharply to his left, he
reached the wide quadrangle with the covered passage running right
round it, the same which de Batz had traversed two evenings ago
when he went to visit Héron.</p>

<p>Armand, with a light heart and springy step, followed him as if
he were going to a feast where he would meet Jeanne, where he would
kneel at her feet, kiss her hands, and lead her triumphantly to
freedom and to happiness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18. The Removal</h2>

<p>Chauvelin no longer made any pretence to hold Armand by the arm.
By temperament as well as by profession a spy, there was one
subject at least which he had mastered thoroughly: that was the
study of human nature. Though occasionally an exceptionally complex
mental organisation baffled him&mdash;as in the case of Sir Percy
Blakeney&mdash;he prided himself, and justly, too, on reading
natures like that of Armand St. Just as he would an open book.</p>

<p>The excitable disposition of the Latin races he knew out and
out; he knew exactly how far a sentimental situation would lead a
young Frenchman like Armand, who was by disposition chivalrous, and
by temperament essentially passionate. Above all things, he knew
when and how far he could trust a man to do either a sublime action
or an essentially foolish one.</p>

<p>Therefore he walked along contentedly now, not even looking back
to see whether St. Just was following him. He knew that he did.</p>

<p>His thoughts only dwelt on the young enthusiast&mdash;in his
mind he called him the young fool&mdash;in order to weigh in the
balance the mighty possibilities that would accrue from the present
sequence of events. The fixed idea ever working in the man's
scheming brain had already transformed a vague belief into a
certainty. That the Scarlet Pimpernel was in Paris at the present
moment Chauvelin had now become convinced. How far he could turn
the capture of Armand St. Just to the triumph of his own ends
remained to be seen.</p>

<p>But this he did know: the Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;the man whom
he had learned to know, to dread, and even in a grudging manner to
admire&mdash;was not like to leave one of his followers in the
lurch. Marguerite's brother in the Temple would be the surest decoy
for the elusive meddler who still, and in spite of all care and
precaution, continued to baffle the army of spies set upon his
track.</p>

<p>Chauvelin could hear Armand's light, elastic footsteps
resounding behind him on the flagstones. A world of intoxicating
possibilities surged up before him. Ambition, which two successive
dire failures had atrophied in his breast, once more rose up
buoyant and hopeful. Once he had sworn to lay the Scarlet Pimpernel
by the heels, and that oath was not yet wholly forgotten; it had
lain dormant after the catastrophe of Boulogne, but with the sight
of Armand St. Just it had re-awakened and confronted him again with
the strength of a likely fulfilment.</p>

<p>The courtyard looked gloomy and deserted. The thin drizzle which
still fell from a persistently leaden sky effectually held every
outline of masonry, of column, or of gate hidden as beneath a
shroud. The corridor which skirted it all round was ill-lighted
save by an occasional oil-lamp fixed in the wall.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin knew his way well. Héron's lodgings gave on the
second courtyard, the Square du Nazaret, and the way thither led
past the main square tower, in the top floor of which the uncrowned
King of France eked out his miserable existence as the plaything of
a rough cobbler and his wife.</p>

<p>Just beneath its frowning bastions Chauvelin turned back towards
Armand. He pointed with a careless hand up-wards to the central
tower.</p>

<p>"We have got little Capet in there," he said dryly. "Your
chivalrous Scarlet Pimpernel has not ventured in these precincts
yet, you see."</p>

<p>Armand was silent. He had no difficulty in looking unconcerned;
his thoughts were so full of Jeanne that he cared but little at
this moment for any Bourbon king or for the destinies of
France.</p>

<p>Now the two men reached the postern gate. A couple of sentinels
were standing by, but the gate itself was open, and from within
there came the sound of bustle and of noise, of a good deal of
swearing, and also of loud laughter.</p>

<p>The guard-room gave on the left of the gate, and the laughter
came from there. It was brilliantly lighted, and Armand, peering
in, in the wake of Chauvelin, could see groups of soldiers sitting
and standing about. There was a table in the centre of the room,
and on it a number of jugs and pewter mugs, packets of cards, and
overturned boxes of dice.</p>

<p>But the bustle did not come from the guard-room; it came from
the landing and the stone stairs beyond.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, apparently curious, had passed through the gate, and
Armand followed him. The light from the open door of the guard-room
cut sharply across the landing, making the gloom beyond appear more
dense and almost solid. From out the darkness, fitfully intersected
by a lanthorn apparently carried to and fro, moving figures loomed
out ghost-like and weirdly gigantic. Soon Armand distinguished a
number of large objects that encumbered the landing, and as he and
Chauvelin left the sharp light of the guard-room behind them, he
could see that the large objects were pieces of furniture of every
shape and size; a wooden bedstead&mdash;dismantled&mdash;leaned
against the wall, a black horsehair sofa blocked the way to the
tower stairs, and there were numberless chairs and several tables
piled one on the top of the other.</p>

<p>In the midst of this litter a stout, flabby-cheeked man stood,
apparently giving directions as to its removal to persons at
present unseen.</p>

<p>"<i>Holà</i>, Papa Simon!" exclaimed Chauvelin jovially; "moving
out to-day? What?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank the Lord!&mdash;if there be a Lord!" retorted the
other curtly. "Is that you, citizen Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>"In person, citizen. I did not know you were leaving quite so
soon. Is citizen Héron anywhere about?"</p>

<p>"Just left," replied Simon. "He had a last look at Capet just
before my wife locked the brat up in the inner room. Now he's gone
back to his lodgings."</p>

<p>A man carrying a chest, empty of its drawers, on his back now
came stumbling down the tower staircase. Madame Simon followed
close on his heels, steadying the chest with one hand.</p>

<p>"We had better begin to load up the cart," she called to her
husband in a high-pitched querulous voice; "the corridor is getting
too much encumbered."</p>

<p>She looked suspiciously at Chauvelin and at Armand, and when she
encountered the former's bland, unconcerned gaze she suddenly
shivered and drew her black shawl closer round her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Bah!" she said, "I shall be glad to get out of this
God-forsaken hole. I hate the very sight of these walls."</p>

<p>"Indeed, the citizeness does not look over robust in health,"
said Chauvelin with studied politeness. "The stay in the tower did
not, mayhap, bring forth all the fruits of prosperity which she had
anticipated."</p>

<p>The woman eyed him with dark suspicion lurking in her hollow
eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, citizen," she said with a shrug of
her wide shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh! I meant nothing," rejoined Chauvelin, smiling. "I am so
interested in your removal; busy man as I am, it has amused me to
watch you. Whom have you got to help you with the furniture?"</p>

<p>"Dupont, the man-of-all-work, from the concierge," said Simon
curtly. "Citizen Héron would not allow any one to come in from the
outside."</p>

<p>"Rightly too. Have the new commissaries come yet?</p>

<p>"Only citizen Cochefer. He is waiting upstairs for the
others."</p>

<p>"And Capet?"</p>

<p>"He is all safe. Citizen Héron came to see him, and then he told
me to lock the little vermin up in the inner room. Citizen Cochefer
had just arrived by that time, and he has remained in charge."</p>

<p>During all this while the man with the chest on his back was
waiting for orders. Bent nearly double, he was grumbling audibly at
his uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>"Does the citizen want to break my back?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"We had best get along&mdash;<i>quoi?</i>"</p>

<p>He asked if he should begin to carry the furniture out into the
street.</p>

<p>"Two sous have I got to pay every ten minutes to the lad who
holds my nag," he said, muttering under his breath; "we shall be
all night at this rate."</p>

<p>"Begin to load then," commanded Simon gruffly.
"Here!&mdash;begin with this sofa."</p>

<p>"You'll have to give me a hand with that," said the man. "Wait a
bit; I'll just see that everything is all right in the cart. I'll
be back directly."</p>

<p>"Take something with you then as you are going down," said
Madame Simon in her querulous voice.</p>

<p>The man picked up a basket of linen that stood in the angle by
the door. He hoisted it on his back and shuffled away with it
across the landing and out through the gate.</p>

<p>"How did Capet like parting from his papa and maman?" asked
Chauvelin with a laugh.</p>

<p>"H'm!" growled Simon laconically. "He will find out soon enough
how well off he was under our care."</p>

<p>"Have the other commissaries come yet?"</p>

<p>"No. But they will be here directly. Citizen Cochefer is
upstairs mounting guard over Capet."</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, Papa Simon," concluded Chauvelin jovially.
"Citizeness, your servant!"</p>

<p>He bowed with unconcealed irony to the cobbler's wife, and
nodded to Simon, who expressed by a volley of motley oaths his
exact feelings with regard to all the agents of the Committee of
General Security.</p>

<p>"Six months of this penal servitude have we had," he said
roughly, "and no thanks or pension. I would as soon serve a
<i>ci-devant</i> aristo as your accursed Committee."</p>

<p>The man Dupont had returned. Stolidly, after the fashion of his
kind, he commenced the removal of citizen Simon's goods. He seemed
a clumsy enough creature, and Simon and his wife had to do most of
the work themselves.</p>

<p>Chauvelin watched the moving forms for a while, then he shrugged
his shoulders with a laugh of indifference, and turned on his
heel.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19. It Is About The
Dauphin</h2>

<p>Héron was not at his lodgings when, at last, after vigorous
pulls at the bell, a great deal of waiting and much cursing,
Chauvelin, closely followed by Armand, was introduced in the chief
agent's office.</p>

<p>The soldier who acted as servant said that citizen Héron had
gone out to sup, but would surely be home again by eight o'clock.
Armand by this time was so dazed with fatigue that he sank on a
chair like a log, and remained there staring into the fire,
unconscious of the flight of time.</p>

<p>Anon Héron came home. He nodded to Chauvelin, and threw but a
cursory glance on Armand.</p>

<p>"Five minutes, citizen," he said, with a rough attempt at an
apology. "I am sorry to keep you waiting, but the new commissaries
have arrived who are to take charge of Capet. The Simons have just
gone, and I want to assure myself that everything is all right in
the Tower. Cochefer has been in charge, but I like to cast an eye
over the brat every day myself."</p>

<p>He went out again, slamming the door behind him. His heavy
footsteps were heard treading the flagstones of the corridor, and
gradually dying away in the distance. Armand had paid no heed
either to his entrance or to his exit. He was only conscious of an
intense weariness, and would at this moment gladly have laid his
head on the scaffold if on it he could find rest.</p>

<p>A white-faced clock on the wall ticked off the seconds one by
one. From the street below came the muffled sounds of wheeled
traffic on the soft mud of the road; it was raining more heavily
now, and from time to time a gust of wind rattled the small windows
in their dilapidated frames, or hurled a shower of heavy drops
against the panes.</p>

<p>The heat from the stove had made Armand drowsy; his head fell
forward on his chest. Chauvelin, with his hands held behind his
back, paced ceaselessly up and down the narrow room.</p>

<p>Suddenly Armand started&mdash;wide awake now. Hurried footsteps
on the flagstones outside, a hoarse shout, a banging of heavy
doors, and the next moment Héron stood once more on the threshold
of the room. Armand, with wide-opened eyes, gazed on him in wonder.
The whole appearance of the man had changed. He looked ten years
older, with lank, dishevelled hair hanging matted over a moist
forehead, the cheeks ashen-white, the full lips bloodless and
hanging, flabby and parted, displaying both rows of yellow teeth
that shook against each other. The whole figure looked bowed, as if
shrunk within itself.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had paused in his restless walk. He gazed on his
colleague, a frown of puzzlement on his pale, set face.</p>

<p>"Capet!" he exclaimed, as soon as he had taken in every detail
of Héron's altered appearance, and seen the look of wild terror
that literally distorted his face.</p>

<p>Héron could not speak; his teeth were chattering in his mouth,
and his tongue seemed paralysed. Chauvelin went up to him. He was
several inches shorter than his colleague, but at this moment he
seemed to be towering over him like an avenging spirit. He placed a
firm hand on the other's bowed shoulders.</p>

<p>"Capet has gone&mdash;is that it?" he queried peremptorily.</p>

<p>The look of terror increased in Héron's eyes, giving its mute
reply.</p>

<p>"How? When?"</p>

<p>But for the moment the man was speechless. An almost maniacal
fear seemed to hold him in its grip. With an impatient oath
Chauvelin turned away from him.</p>

<p>"Brandy!" he said curtly, speaking to Armand.</p>

<p>A bottle and glass were found in the cupboard. It was St. Just
who poured out the brandy and held it to Héron's lips. Chauvelin
was once more pacing up and down the room in angry impatience.</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together, man," he said roughly after a while,
"and try and tell me what has occurred."</p>

<p>Héron had sunk into a chair. He passed a trembling hand once or
twice over his forehead.</p>

<p>"Capet has disappeared," he murmured; "he must have been
spirited away while the Simons were moving their furniture. That
accursed Cochefer was completely taken in."</p>

<p>Héron spoke in a toneless voice, hardly above a whisper, and
like one whose throat is dry and mouth parched. But the brandy had
revived him somewhat, and his eyes lost their former glassy
look.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Chauvelin curtly.</p>

<p>"I was just leaving the Tower when he arrived. I spoke to him at
the door. I had seen Capet safely installed in the room, and gave
orders to the woman Simon to let citizen Cochefer have a look at
him, too, and then to lock up the brat in the inner room and
install Cochefer in the antechamber on guard. I stood talking to
Cochefer for a few moments in the antechamber. The woman Simon and
the man-of-all-work, Dupont&mdash;whom I know well&mdash;were busy
with the furniture. There could not have been any one else
concealed about the place&mdash;that I'll swear. Cochefer, after he
took leave of me, went straight into the room; he found the woman
Simon in the act of turning the key in the door of the inner
chamber. 'I have locked Capet in there,' she said, giving the key
to Cochefer; 'he will be quite safe until to-night; when the other
commissaries come.'"</p>

<p>"Didn't Cochefer go into the room and ascertain whether the
woman was lying?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did! He made the woman re-open the door and peeped in
over her shoulder. She said the child was asleep. He vows that he
saw the child lying fully dressed on a rug in the further corner of
the room. The room, of course, was quite empty of furniture and
only lighted by one candle, but there was the rug and the child
asleep on it. Cochefer swears he saw him, and now&mdash;when I went
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The commissaries were all there&mdash;Cochefer and Lasnière,
Lorinet and Legrand. We went into the inner room, and I had a
candle in my hand. We saw the child lying on the rug, just as
Cochefer had seen him, and for a while we took no notice of it.
Then some one&mdash;I think it was Lorinet&mdash;went to have a
closer look at the brat. He took up the candle and went up to the
rug. Then he gave a cry, and we all gathered round him. The
sleeping child was only a bundle of hair and of clothes, a
dummy&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>There was silence now in the narrow room, while the white-faced
clock continued to tick off each succeeding second of time. Héron
had once more buried his head in his hands; a trembling&mdash;like
an attack of ague&mdash;shook his wide, bony shoulders. Armand had
listened to the narrative with glowing eyes and a beating heart.
The details which the two Terrorists here could not probably
understand he had already added to the picture which his mind had
conjured up.</p>

<p>He was back in thought now in the small lodging in the rear of
St. Germain l'Auxerrois; Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was there, and my Lord
Tony and Hastings, and a man was striding up and down the room,
looking out into the great space beyond the river with the eyes of
a seer, and a firm voice said abruptly:</p>

<p>"It is about the Dauphin!"</p>

<p>"Have you any suspicions?" asked Chauvelin now, pausing in his
walk beside Héron, and once more placing a firm, peremptory hand on
his colleague's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Suspicions!" exclaimed the chief agent with a loud oath.
"Suspicions! Certainties, you mean. The man sat here but two days
ago, in that very chair, and bragged of what he would do. I told
him then that if he interfered with Capet I would wring his neck
with my own hands."</p>

<p>And his long, talon-like fingers, with their sharp, grimy nails,
closed and unclosed like those of feline creatures when they hold
the coveted prey.</p>

<p>"Of whom do you speak?" queried Chauvelin curtly.</p>

<p>"Of whom? Of whom but that accursed de Batz? His pockets are
bulging with Austrian money, with which, no doubt, he has bribed
the Simons and Cochefer and the sentinels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Lorinet and Lasnière and you," interposed Chauvelin
dryly.</p>

<p>"It is false!" roared Héron, who already at the suggestion was
foaming at the mouth, and had jumped up from his chair, standing at
bay as if prepared to fight for his life.</p>

<p>"False, is it?" retorted Chauvelin calmly; "then be not so
quick, friend Héron, in slashing out with senseless denunciations
right and left. You'll gain nothing by denouncing any one just now.
This is too intricate a matter to be dealt with a sledge-hammer. Is
any one up in the Tower at this moment?" he asked in quiet,
business-like tones.</p>

<p>"Yes. Cochefer and the others are still there. They are making
wild schemes to cover their treachery. Cochefer is aware of his own
danger, and Lasnière and the others know that they arrived at the
Tower several hours too late. They are all at fault, and they know
it. As for that de Batz," he continued with a voice rendered
raucous with bitter passion, "I swore to him two days ago that he
should not escape me if he meddled with Capet. I'm on his track
already. I'll have him before the hour of midnight, and I'll
torture him&mdash;yes! I'll torture him&mdash;the Tribunal shall
give me leave. We have a dark cell down below here where my men
know how to apply tortures worse than the rack&mdash;where they
know just how to prolong life long enough to make it unendurable.
I'll torture him! I'll torture him!"</p>

<p>But Chauvelin abruptly silenced the wretch with a curt command;
then, without another word, he walked straight out of the room.</p>

<p>In thought Armand followed him. The wild desire was suddenly
born in him to run away at this moment, while Héron, wrapped in his
own meditations, was paying no heed to him. Chauvelin's footsteps
had long ago died away in the distance; it was a long way to the
upper floor of the Tower, and some time would be spent, too, in
interrogating the commissaries. This was Armand's opportunity.
After all, if he were free himself he might more effectually help
to rescue Jeanne. He knew, too, now where to join his leader. The
corner of the street by the canal, where Sir Andrew Ffoulkes would
be waiting with the coal-cart; then there was the spinney on the
road to St. Germain. Armand hoped that, with good luck, he might
yet overtake his comrades, tell them of Jeanne's plight, and
entreat them to work for her rescue.</p>

<p>He had forgotten that now he had no certificate of safety, that
undoubtedly he would be stopped at the gates at this hour of the
night; that his conduct proving suspect he would in all probability
he detained, and, mayhap, be brought back to this self-same place
within an hour. He had forgotten all that, for the primeval
instinct for freedom had suddenly been aroused. He rose softly from
his chair and crossed the room. Héron paid no attention to him. Now
he had traversed the antechamber and unlatched the outer door.</p>

<p>Immediately a couple of bayonets were crossed in front of him,
two more further on ahead scintillated feebly in the flickering
light. Chauvelin had taken his precautions. There was no doubt that
Armand St. Just was effectually a prisoner now.</p>

<p>With a sigh of disappointment he went back to his place beside
the fire. Héron had not even moved whilst he had made this futile
attempt at escape. Five minutes later Chauvelin re-entered the
room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20. The Certificate Of
Safety</h2>

<p>"You can leave de Batz and his gang alone, citizen Héron," said
Chauvelin, as soon as he had closed the door behind him; "he had
nothing to do with the escape of the Dauphin."</p>

<p>Héron growled out a few words of incredulity. But Chauvelin
shrugged his shoulders and looked with unutterable contempt on his
colleague. Armand, who was watching him closely, saw that in his
hand he held a small piece of paper, which he had crushed into a
shapeless mass.</p>

<p>"Do not waste your time, citizen," he said, "in raging against
an empty wind-bag. Arrest de Batz if you like, or leave him alone
an you please&mdash;we have nothing to fear from that
braggart."</p>

<p>With nervous, slightly shaking fingers he set to work to smooth
out the scrap of paper which he held. His hot hands had soiled it
and pounded it until it was a mere rag and the writing on it
illegible. But, such as it was, he threw it down with a blasphemous
oath on the desk in front of Héron's eyes.</p>

<p>"It is that accursed Englishman who has been at work again," he
said more calmly; "I guessed it the moment I heard your story. Set
your whole army of sleuth-hounds on his track, citizen; you'll need
them all."</p>

<p>Héron picked up the scrap of torn paper and tried to decipher
the writing on it by the light from the lamp. He seemed almost
dazed now with the awful catastrophe that had befallen him, and the
fear that his own wretched life would have to pay the penalty for
the disappearance of the child.</p>

<p>As for Armand&mdash;even in the midst of his own troubles, and
of his own anxiety for Jeanne, he felt a proud exultation in his
heart. The Scarlet Pimpernel had succeeded; Percy had not failed in
his self-imposed undertaking. Chauvelin, whose piercing eyes were
fixed on him at that moment, smiled with contemptuous irony.</p>

<p>"As you will find your hands overfull for the next few hours,
citizen Héron," he said, speaking to his colleague and nodding in
the direction of Armand, "I'll not trouble you with the voluntary
confession this young citizen desired to make to you. All I need
tell you is that he is an adherent of the Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;I
believe one of his most faithful, most trusted officers."</p>

<p>Héron roused himself from the maze of gloomy thoughts that were
again paralysing his tongue. He turned bleary, wild eyes on
Armand.</p>

<p>"We have got one of them, then?" he murmured incoherently,
babbling like a drunken man.</p>

<p>"M'yes!" replied Chauvelin lightly; "but it is too late now for
a formal denunciation and arrest. He cannot leave Paris anyhow, and
all that your men need to do is to keep a close look-out on him.
But I should send him home to-night if I were you."</p>

<p>Héron muttered something more, which, however, Armand did not
understand. Chauvelin's words were still ringing in his ear. Was
he, then, to be set free to-night? Free in a measure, of course,
since spies were to be set to watch him&mdash;but free,
nevertheless? He could not understand Chauvelin's attitude, and his
own self-love was not a little wounded at the thought that he was
of such little account that these men could afford to give him even
this provisional freedom. And, of course, there was still
Jeanne.</p>

<p>"I must, therefore, bid you good-night, citizen," Chauvelin was
saying in his bland, gently ironical manner. "You will be glad to
return to your lodgings. As you see, the chief agent of the
Committee of General Security is too much occupied just now to
accept the sacrifice of your life which you were prepared so
generously to offer him."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, citizen," retorted Armand coldly, "nor
do I desire indulgence at your hands. You have arrested an innocent
woman on the trumped-up charge that she was harbouring me. I came
here to-night to give myself up to justice so that she might be set
free."</p>

<p>"But the hour is somewhat late, citizen," rejoined Chauvelin
urbanely. "The lady in whom you take so fervent an interest is no
doubt asleep in her cell at this hour. It would not be fitting to
disturb her now. She might not find shelter before morning, and the
weather is quite exceptionally unpropitious."</p>

<p>"Then, sir," said Armand, a little bewildered, "am I to
understand that if I hold myself at your disposition Mademoiselle
Lange will be set free as early to-morrow morning as may be?"</p>

<p>"No doubt, sir&mdash;no doubt," replied Chauvelin with more than
his accustomed blandness; "if you will hold yourself entirely at
our disposition, Mademoiselle Lange will be set free to-morrow. I
think that we can safely promise that, citizen Héron, can we not?"
he added, turning to his colleague.</p>

<p>But Héron, overcome with the stress of emotions, could only
murmur vague, unintelligible words.</p>

<p>"Your word on that, citizen Chauvelin?" asked Armand.</p>

<p>"My word on it an you will accept it."</p>

<p>"No, I will not do that. Give me an unconditional certificate of
safety and I will believe you."</p>

<p>"Of what use were that to you?" asked Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"I believe my capture to be of more importance to you than that
of Mademoiselle Lange," said Armand quietly. "I will use the
certificate of safety for myself or one of my friends if you break
your word to me anent Mademoiselle Lange."</p>

<p>"H'm! the reasoning is not illogical, citizen," said Chauvelin,
whilst a curious smile played round the corners of his thin lips.
"You are quite right. You are a more valuable asset to us than the
charming lady who, I hope, will for many a day and year to come
delight pleasure-loving Paris with her talent and her grace."</p>

<p>"Amen to that, citizen," said Armand fervently.</p>

<p>"Well, it will all depend on you, sir! Here," he added, coolly
running over some papers on Héron's desk until he found what he
wanted, "is an absolutely unconditional certificate of safety. The
Committee of General Security issue very few of these. It is worth
the cost of a human life. At no barrier or gate of any city can
such a certificate be disregarded, nor even can it be detained.
Allow me to hand it to you, citizen, as a pledge of my own good
faith."</p>

<p>Smiling, urbane, with a curious look that almost expressed
amusement lurking in his shrewd, pale eyes, Chauvelin handed the
momentous document to Armand.</p>

<p>The young man studied it very carefully before he slipped it
into the inner pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>"How soon shall I have news of Mademoiselle Lange?" he asked
finally.</p>

<p>"In the course of to-morrow. I myself will call on you and
redeem that precious document in person. You, on the other hand,
will hold yourself at my disposition. That's understood, is it
not?"</p>

<p>"I shall not fail you. My lodgings are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! do not trouble," interposed Chauvelin, with a polite bow;
"we can find that out for ourselves."</p>

<p>Héron had taken no part in this colloquy. Now that Armand
prepared to go he made no attempt to detain him, or to question his
colleague's actions. He sat by the table like a log; his mind was
obviously a blank to all else save to his own terrors engendered by
the events of this night.</p>

<p>With bleary, half-veiled eyes he followed Armand's progress
through the room, and seemed unaware of the loud slamming of the
outside door. Chauvelin had escorted the young man past the first
line of sentry, then he took cordial leave of him.</p>

<p>"Your certificate will, you will find, open every gate to you.
Good-night, citizen. <i>A demain</i>."</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>Armand's slim figure disappeared in the gloom. Chauvelin watched
him for a few moments until even his footsteps had died away in the
distance; then he turned back towards Héron's lodgings.</p>

<p>"<i>A nous deux</i>," he muttered between tightly clenched
teeth; "<i>à nous deux</i> once more, my enigmatical Scarlet
Pimpernel."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21. Back To Paris</h2>

<p>It was an exceptionally dark night, and the rain was falling in
torrents. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, wrapped in a piece of sacking, had
taken shelter right underneath the coal-cart; even then he was
getting wet through to the skin.</p>

<p>He had worked hard for two days coal-heaving, and the night
before he had found a cheap, squalid lodging where at any rate he
was protected from the inclemencies of the weather; but to-night he
was expecting Blakeney at the appointed hour and place. He had
secured a cart of the ordinary ramshackle pattern used for carrying
coal. Unfortunately there were no covered ones to be obtained in
the neighbourhood, and equally unfortunately the thaw had set in
with a blustering wind and driving rain, which made waiting in the
open air for hours at a stretch and in complete darkness
excessively unpleasant.</p>

<p>But for all these discomforts Sir Andrew Ffoulkes cared not one
jot. In England, in his magnificent Suffolk home, he was a
confirmed sybarite, in whose service every description of comfort
and luxury had to be enrolled. Here tonight in the rough and
tattered clothes of a coal-heaver, drenched to the skin, and
crouching under the body of a cart that hardly sheltered him from
the rain, he was as happy as a schoolboy out for a holiday.</p>

<p>Happy, but vaguely anxious.</p>

<p>He had no means of ascertaining the time. So many of the
church-bells and clock towers had been silenced recently that not
one of those welcome sounds penetrated to the dreary desolation of
this canal wharf, with its abandoned carts standing ghostlike in a
row. Darkness had set in very early in the afternoon, and the
heavers had given up work soon after four o'clock.</p>

<p>For about an hour after that a certain animation had still
reigned round the wharf, men crossing and going, one or two of the
barges moving in or out alongside the quay. But for some time now
darkness and silence had been the masters in this desolate spot,
and that time had seemed to Sir Andrew an eternity. He had hobbled
and tethered his horse, and stretched himself out at full length
under the cart. Now and again he had crawled out from under this
uncomfortable shelter and walked up and down in ankle-deep mud,
trying to restore circulation in his stiffened limbs; now and again
a kind of torpor had come over him, and he had fallen into a brief
and restless sleep. He would at this moment have given half his
fortune for knowledge of the exact time.</p>

<p>But through all this weary waiting he was never for a moment in
doubt. Unlike Armand St. Just, he had the simplest, most perfect
faith in his chief. He had been Blakeney's constant companion in
all these adventures for close upon four years now; the thought of
failure, however vague, never once entered his mind.</p>

<p>He was only anxious for his chief's welfare. He knew that he
would succeed, but he would have liked to have spared himself much
of the physical fatigue and the nerve-racking strain of these hours
that lay between the daring deed and the hope of safety. Therefore
he was conscious of an acute tingling of his nerves, which went on
even during the brief patches of fitful sleep, and through the
numbness that invaded his whole body while the hours dragged
wearily and slowly along.</p>

<p>Then, quite suddenly, he felt wakeful and alert; quite a
while&mdash;even before he heard the welcome signal&mdash;he knew,
with a curious, subtle sense of magnetism, that the hour had come,
and that his chief was somewhere near by, not very far.</p>

<p>Then he heard the cry&mdash;a seamew's call&mdash;repeated
thrice at intervals, and five minutes later something loomed out of
the darkness quite close to the hind wheels of the cart.</p>

<p>"Hist! Ffoulkes!" came in a soft whisper, scarce louder than the
wind.</p>

<p>"Present!" came in quick response.</p>

<p>"Here, help me to lift the child into the cart. He is asleep,
and has been a dead weight on my arm for close on an hour now. Have
you a dry bit of sacking or something to lay him on?"</p>

<p>"Not very dry, I am afraid."</p>

<p>With tender care the two men lifted the sleeping little King of
France into the rickety cart. Blakeney laid his cloak over him, and
listened for awhile to the slow regular breathing of the child.</p>

<p>"St. Just is not here&mdash;you know that?" said Sir Andrew
after a while.</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew it," replied Blakeney curtly.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of these two men that not a word about the
adventure itself, about the terrible risks and dangers of the past
few hours, was exchanged between them. The child was here and was
safe, and Blakeney knew the whereabouts of St. Just&mdash;that was
enough for Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, the most devoted follower, the most
perfect friend the Scarlet Pimpernel would ever know.</p>

<p>Ffoulkes now went to the horse, detached the nose-bag, and undid
the nooses of the hobble and of the tether.</p>

<p>"Will you get in now, Blakeney?" he said; "we are ready."</p>

<p>And in unbroken silence they both got into the cart; Blakeney
sitting on its floor beside the child, and Ffoulkes gathering the
reins in his hands.</p>

<p>The wheels of the cart and the slow jog-trot of the horse made
scarcely any noise in the mud of the roads, what noise they did
make was effectually drowned by the soughing of the wind in the
bare branches of the stunted acacia trees that edged the towpath
along the line of the canal.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew had studied the topography of this desolate
neighbourhood well during the past twenty-four hours; he knew of a
detour that would enable him to avoid the La Villette gate and the
neighbourhood of the fortifications, and yet bring him out soon on
the road leading to St. Germain.</p>

<p>Once he turned to ask Blakeney the time.</p>

<p>"It must be close on ten now," replied Sir Percy. "Push your nag
along, old man. Tony and Hastings will be waiting for us."</p>

<p>It was very difficult to see clearly even a mètre or two ahead,
but the road was a straight one, and the old nag seemed to know it
almost as well and better than her driver. She shambled along at
her own pace, covering the ground very slowly for Ffoulkes's
burning impatience. Once or twice he had to get down and lead her
over a rough piece of ground. They passed several groups of dismal,
squalid houses, in some of which a dim light still burned, and as
they skirted St. Ouen the church clock slowly tolled the hour of
midnight.</p>

<p>But for the greater part of the way derelict, uncultivated
spaces of <i>terres vagues</i>, and a few isolated houses lay
between the road and the fortifications of the city. The darkness
of the night, the late hour, the soughing of the wind, were all in
favour of the adventurers; and a coal-cart slowly trudging along in
this neighbourhood, with two labourers sitting in it, was the least
likely of any vehicle to attract attention.</p>

<p>Past Clichy, they had to cross the river by the rickety wooden
bridge that was unsafe even in broad daylight. They were not far
from their destination now. Half a dozen kilometres further on they
would be leaving Courbevoie on their left, and then the sign-post
would come in sight. After that the spinney just off the road, and
the welcome presence of Tony, Hastings, and the horses. Ffoulkes
got down in order to make sure of the way. He walked at the horse's
head now, fearful lest he missed the cross-roads and the
sign-post.</p>

<p>The horse was getting over-tired; it had covered fifteen
kilometres, and it was close on three o'clock of Monday
morning.</p>

<p>Another hour went by in absolute silence. Ffoulkes and Blakeney
took turns at the horse's head. Then at last they reached the
cross-roads; even through the darkness the sign-post showed white
against the surrounding gloom.</p>

<p>"This looks like it," murmured Sir Andrew. He turned the horse's
head sharply towards the left, down a narrower road, and leaving
the sign-post behind him. He walked slowly along for another
quarter of an hour, then Blakeney called a halt.</p>

<p>"The spinney must be sharp on our right now," he said.</p>

<p>He got down from the cart, and while Ffoulkes remained beside
the horse, he plunged into the gloom. A moment later the cry of the
seamew rang out three times into the air. It was answered almost
immediately.</p>

<p>The spinney lay on the right of the road. Soon the soft sounds
that to a trained ear invariably betray the presence of a number of
horses reached Ffoulkes' straining senses. He took his old nag out
of the shafts, and the shabby harness from off her, then he turned
her out on the piece of waste land that faced the spinney. Some one
would find her in the morning, her and the cart with the shabby
harness laid in it, and, having wondered if all these things had
perchance dropped down from heaven, would quietly appropriate them,
and mayhap thank much-maligned heaven for its gift.</p>

<p>Blakeney in the meanwhile had lifted the sleeping child out of
the cart. Then he called to Sir Andrew and led the way across the
road and into the spinney.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Hastings received the uncrowned King of
France in his arms.</p>

<p>Unlike Ffoulkes, my Lord Tony wanted to hear all about the
adventure of this afternoon. A thorough sportsman, he loved a good
story of hairbreadth escapes, of dangers cleverly avoided, risks
taken and conquered.</p>

<p>"Just in ten words, Blakeney," he urged entreatingly; "how did
you actually get the boy away?"</p>

<p>Sir Percy laughed&mdash;despite himself&mdash;at the young man's
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Next time we meet, Tony," he begged; "I am so demmed fatigued,
and there's this beastly rain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;now! while Hastings sees to the horses. I could
not exist long without knowing, and we are well sheltered from the
rain under this tree."</p>

<p>"Well, then, since you will have it," he began with a laugh,
which despite the weariness and anxiety of the past twenty-four
hours had forced itself to his lips, "I have been sweeper and
man-of-all-work at the Temple for the past few weeks, you must
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" ejaculated my Lord Tony lustily. "By gum!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, you old sybarite, whilst you were enjoying yourself
heaving coal on the canal wharf, I was scrubbing floors, lighting
fires, and doing a number of odd jobs for a lot of demmed murdering
villains, and"&mdash;he added under his breath&mdash;"incidentally,
too, for our league. Whenever I had an hour or two off duty I spent
them in my lodgings, and asked you all to come and meet me
there."</p>

<p>"By Gad, Blakeney! Then the day before yesterday?&mdash;when we
all met&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had just had a bath&mdash;sorely needed, I can tell you. I
had been cleaning boots half the day, but I had heard that the
Simons were removing from the Temple on the Sunday, and had
obtained an order from them to help them shift their
furniture."</p>

<p>"Cleaning boots!" murmured my Lord Tony with a chuckle. "Well!
and then?"</p>

<p>"Well, then everything worked out splendidly. You see by that
time I was a well-known figure in the Temple. Héron knew me well. I
used to be his lanthorn-bearer when at nights he visited that poor
mite in his prison. It was 'Dupont, here! Dupont there!' all day
long. 'Light the fire in the office, Dupont! Dupont, brush my coat!
Dupont, fetch me a light!' When the Simons wanted to move their
household goods they called loudly for Dupont. I got a covered
laundry cart, and I brought a dummy with me to substitute for the
child. Simon himself knew nothing of this, but Madame was in my
pay. The dummy was just splendid, with real hair on its head;
Madame helped me to substitute it for the child; we laid it on the
sofa and covered it over with a rug, even while those brutes Héron
and Cochefer were on the landing outside, and we stuffed His
Majesty the King of France into a linen basket. The room was badly
lighted, and any one would have been deceived. No one was
suspicious of that type of trickery, so it went off splendidly. I
moved the furniture of the Simons out of the Tower. His Majesty
King Louis XVII was still concealed in the linen basket. I drove
the Simons to their new lodgings&mdash;the man still suspects
nothing&mdash;and there I helped them to unload the
furniture&mdash;with the exception of the linen basket, of course.
After that I drove my laundry cart to a house I knew of and
collected a number of linen baskets, which I had arranged should be
in readiness for me. Thus loaded up I left Paris by the Vincennes
gate, and drove as far as Bagnolet, where there is no road except
past the octroi, where the officials might have proved unpleasant.
So I lifted His Majesty out of the basket and we walked on hand in
hand in the darkness and the rain until the poor little feet gave
out. Then the little fellow&mdash;who has been wonderfully plucky
throughout, indeed, more a Capet than a Bourbon&mdash;snuggled up
in my arms and went fast asleep, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, I think
that's all, for here we are, you see."</p>

<p>"But if Madame Simon had not been amenable to bribery?"
suggested Lord Tony after a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"Then I should have had to think of something else."</p>

<p>"If during the removal of the furniture Héron had remained
resolutely in the room?"</p>

<p>"Then, again, I should have had to think of something else; but
remember that in life there is always one supreme moment when
Chance&mdash;who is credited to have but one hair on her
head&mdash;stands by you for a brief space of time; sometimes that
space is infinitesimal&mdash;one minute, a few seconds&mdash;just
the time to seize Chance by that one hair. So I pray you all give
me no credit in this or any other matter in which we all work
together, but the quickness of seizing Chance by the hair during
the brief moment when she stands by my side. If Madame Simon had
been un-amenable, if Héron had remained in the room all the time,
if Cochefer had had two looks at the dummy instead of
one&mdash;well, then, something else would have helped me,
something would have occurred; something&mdash;I know not
what&mdash;but surely something which Chance meant to be on our
side, if only we were quick enough to seize it&mdash;and so you see
how simple it all is."</p>

<p>So simple, in fact, that it was sublime. The daring, the pluck,
the ingenuity and, above all, the super-human heroism and endurance
which rendered the hearers of this simple narrative, simply told,
dumb with admiration.</p>

<p>Their thoughts now were beyond verbal expression.</p>

<p>"How soon was the hue and cry for the child about the streets?"
asked Tony, after a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"It was not out when I left the gates of Paris," said Blakeney
meditatively; "so quietly has the news of the escape been kept,
that I am wondering what devilry that brute Héron can be after. And
now no more chattering," he continued lightly; "all to horse, and
you, Hastings, have a care. The destinies of France, mayhap, will
be lying asleep in your arms."</p>

<p>"But you, Blakeney?" exclaimed the three men almost
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"I am not going with you. I entrust the child to you. For God's
sake guard him well! Ride with him to Mantes. You should arrive
there at about ten o'clock. One of you then go straight to No.9 Rue
la Tour. Ring the bell; an old man will answer it. Say the one word
to him, '<i>Enfant</i>'; he will reply, '<i>De roi!</i>' Give him
the child, and may Heaven bless you all for the help you have given
me this night!"</p>

<p>"But you, Blakeney?" reiterated Tony with a note of deep anxiety
in his fresh young voice.</p>

<p>"I am straight for Paris," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Therefore feasible."</p>

<p>"But why? Percy, in the name of Heaven, do you realise what you
are doing?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"They'll not leave a stone unturned to find you&mdash;they know
by now, believe me, that your hand did this trick."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"And yet you mean to go back?"</p>

<p>"And yet I am going back."</p>

<p>"Blakeney!"</p>

<p>"It's no use, Tony. Armand is in Paris. I saw him in the
corridor of the Temple prison in the company of Chauvelin."</p>

<p>"Great God!" exclaimed Lord Hastings.</p>

<p>The others were silent. What was the use of arguing? One of
themselves was in danger. Armand St. Just, the brother of
Marguerite Blakeney! Was it likely that Percy would leave him in
the lurch.</p>

<p>"One of us will stay with you, of course?" asked Sir Andrew
after awhile.</p>

<p>"Yes! I want Hastings and Tony to take the child to Mantes, then
to make all possible haste for Calais, and there to keep in close
touch with the <i>Daydream</i>; the skipper will contrive to open
communication. Tell him to remain in Calais waters. I hope I may
have need of him soon.</p>

<p>"And now to horse, both of you," he added gaily. "Hastings, when
you are ready, I will hand up the child to you. He will be quite
safe on the pillion with a strap round him and you."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said after that. The orders were given, there
was nothing to do but to obey; and the uncrowned King of France was
not yet out of danger. Hastings and Tony led two of the horses out
of the spinney; at the roadside they mounted, and then the little
lad for whose sake so much heroism, such selfless devotion had been
expended, was hoisted up, still half asleep, on the pillion in
front of my Lord Hastings.</p>

<p>"Keep your arm round him," admonished Blakeney; "your horse
looks quiet enough. But put on speed as far as Mantes, and may
Heaven guard you both!"</p>

<p>The two men pressed their heels to their horses' flanks, the
beasts snorted and pawed the ground anxious to start. There were a
few whispered farewells, two loyal hands were stretched out at the
last, eager to grasp the leader's hand.</p>

<p>Then horses and riders disappeared in the utter darkness which
comes before the dawn.</p>

<p>Blakeney and Ffoulkes stood side by side in silence for as long
as the pawing of hoofs in the mud could reach their ears, then
Ffoulkes asked abruptly:</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do, Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"Well, for the present, my dear fellow, I want you to take one
of the three horses we have left in the spinney, and put him into
the shafts of our old friend the coal-cart; then I am afraid that
you must go back the way we came."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Continue to heave coal on the canal wharf by La Villette; it is
the best way to avoid attention. After your day's work keep your
cart and horse in readiness against my arrival, at the same spot
where you were last night. If after having waited for me like this
for three consecutive nights you neither see nor hear anything from
me, go back to England and tell Marguerite that in giving my life
for her brother I gave it for her!"</p>

<p>"Blakeney&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I spoke differently to what I usually do, is that it?" he
interposed, placing his firm hand on his friend's shoulder. "I am
degenerating, Ffoulkes&mdash;that's what it is. Pay no heed to it.
I suppose that carrying that sleeping child in my arms last night
softened some nerves in my body. I was so infinitely sorry for the
poor mite, and vaguely wondered if I had not saved it from one
misery only to plunge it in another. There was such a fateful look
on that wan little face, as if destiny had already writ its veto
there against happiness. It came on me then how futile were our
actions, if God chooses to interpose His will between us and our
desires."</p>

<p>Almost as he left off speaking the rain ceased to patter down
against the puddles in the road. Overhead the clouds flew by at
terrific speed, driven along by the blustering wind. It was less
dark now, and Sir Andrew, peering through the gloom, could see his
leader's face. It was singularly pale and hard, and the deep-set
lazy eyes had in them just that fateful look which he himself had
spoken of just now.</p>

<p>"You are anxious about Armand, Percy?" asked Ffoulkes
softly.</p>

<p>"Yes. He should have trusted me, as I had trusted him. He missed
me at the Villette gate on Friday, and without a thought left
me&mdash;left us all in the lurch; he threw himself into the lion's
jaws, thinking that he could help the girl he loved. I knew that I
could save her. She is in comparative safety even now. The old
woman, Madame Belhomme, had been freely released the day after her
arrest, but Jeanne Lange is still in the house in the Rue de
Charonne. You know it, Ffoulkes. I got her there early this
morning. It was easy for me, of course: '<i>Holà</i>, Dupont! my
boots, Dupont!' 'One moment, citizen, my daughter&mdash;' 'Curse
thy daughter, bring me my boots!' and Jeanne Lange walked out of
the Temple prison her hand in that of that lout Dupont."</p>

<p>"But Armand does not know that she is in the Rue de
Charonne?"</p>

<p>"No. I have not seen him since that early morning on Saturday
when he came to tell me that she had been arrested. Having sworn
that he would obey me, he went to meet you and Tony at La Villette,
but returned to Paris a few hours later, and drew the undivided
attention of all the committees on Jeanne Lange by his senseless,
foolish inquiries. But for his action throughout the whole of
yesterday I could have smuggled Jeanne out of Paris, got her to
join you at Villette, or Hastings in St. Germain. But the barriers
were being closely watched for her, and I had the Dauphin to think
of. She is in comparative safety; the people in the Rue de Charonne
are friendly for the moment; but for how long? Who knows? I must
look after her of course. And Armand! Poor old Armand! The lion's
jaws have snapped over him, and they hold him tight. Chauvelin and
his gang are using him as a decoy to trap me, of course. All that
had not happened if Armand had trusted me."</p>

<p>He sighed a quick sigh of impatience, almost of regret. Ffoulkes
was the one man who could guess the bitter disappointment that this
had meant. Percy had longed to be back in England soon, back to
Marguerite, to a few days of unalloyed happiness and a few days of
peace.</p>

<p>Now Armand's actions had retarded all that; they were a
deliberate bar to the future as it had been mapped out by a man who
foresaw everything, who was prepared for every eventuality.</p>

<p>In this case, too, he had been prepared, but not for the want of
trust which had brought on disobedience akin to disloyalty. That
absolutely unforeseen eventuality had changed Blakeney's usual
irresponsible gaiety into a consciousness of the inevitable, of the
inexorable decrees of Fate.</p>

<p>With an anxious sigh, Sir Andrew turned away from his chief and
went back to the spinney to select for his own purpose one of the
three horses which Hastings and Tony had unavoidably left
behind.</p>

<p>"And you, Blakeney&mdash;how will you go back to that awful
Paris?" he said, when he had made his choice and was once more back
beside Percy.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," replied Blakeney, "but it would not be safe
to ride. I'll reach one of the gates on this side of the city and
contrive to slip in somehow. I have a certificate of safety in my
pocket in case I need it.</p>

<p>"We'll leave the horses here," he said presently, whilst he was
helping Sir Andrew to put the horse in the shafts of the coal-cart;
"they cannot come to much harm. Some poor devil might steal them,
in order to escape from those vile brutes in the city. If so, God
speed him, say I. I'll compensate my friend the farmer of St.
Germain for their loss at an early opportunity. And now, good-bye,
my dear fellow! Some time to-night, if possible, you shall hear
direct news of me&mdash;if not, then to-morrow or the day after
that. Good-bye, and Heaven guard you!"</p>

<p>"God guard you, Blakeney!" said Sir Andrew fervently.</p>

<p>He jumped into the cart and gathered up the reins. His heart was
heavy as lead, and a strange mist had gathered in his eyes,
blurring the last dim vision which he had of his chief standing all
alone in the gloom, his broad, magnificent figure looking almost
weirdly erect and defiant, his head thrown back, and his kind, lazy
eyes watching the final departure of his most faithful comrade and
friend.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22. Of That There Could Be
No Question</h2>

<p>Blakeney had more than one <i>pied-ã-terre</i> in Paris, and
never stayed longer than two or three days in any of these. It was
not difficult for a single man, be he labourer or <i>bourgeois</i>,
to obtain a night's lodging, even in these most troublous times,
and in any quarter of Paris, provided the rent&mdash;out of all
proportion to the comfort and accommodation given&mdash;was paid
ungrudgingly and in advance.</p>

<p>Emigration and, above all, the enormous death-roll of the past
eighteen months, had emptied the apartment houses of the great
city, and those who had rooms to let were only too glad of a
lodger, always providing they were not in danger of being worried
by the committees of their section.</p>

<p>The laws framed by these same committees now demanded that all
keepers of lodging or apartment houses should within twenty-four
hours give notice at the bureau of their individual sections of the
advent of new lodgers, together with a description of the personal
appearance of such lodgers, and an indication of their presumed
civil status and occupation. But there was a margin of twenty-four
hours, which could on pressure be extended to forty-eight, and,
therefore, any one could obtain shelter for forty-eight hours, and
have no questions asked, provided he or she was willing to pay the
exorbitant sum usually asked under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Thus Blakeney had no difficulty in securing what lodgings he
wanted when he once more found himself inside Paris at somewhere
about noon of that same Monday.</p>

<p>The thought of Hastings and Tony speeding on towards Mantes with
the royal child safely held in Hastings' arms had kept his spirits
buoyant and caused him for a while to forget the terrible peril in
which Armand St. Just's thoughtless egoism had placed them
both.</p>

<p>Blakeney was a man of abnormal physique and iron nerve, else he
could never have endured the fatigues of the past twenty-four
hours, from the moment when on the Sunday afternoon he began to
play his part of furniture-remover at the Temple, to that when at
last on Monday at noon he succeeded in persuading the sergeant at
the Maillot gate that he was an honest stonemason residing at
Neuilly, who was come to Paris in search of work.</p>

<p>After that matters became more simple. Terribly foot-sore,
though he would never have admitted it, hungry and weary, he turned
into an unpretentious eating-house and ordered some dinner. The
place when he entered was occupied mostly by labourers and workmen,
dressed very much as he was himself, and quite as grimy as he had
become after having driven about for hours in a laundry-cart and in
a coal-cart, and having walked twelve kilometres, some of which he
had covered whilst carrying a sleeping child in his arms.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart., the friend and companion of the
Prince of Wales, the most fastidious fop the <i>salons</i> of
London and Bath had ever seen, was in no way distinguishable
outwardly from the tattered, half-starved, dirty, and out-at-elbows
products of this fraternising and equalising Republic.</p>

<p>He was so hungry that the ill-cooked, badly-served meal tempted
him to eat; and he ate on in silence, seemingly more interested in
boiled beef than in the conversation that went on around him. But
he would not have been the keen and daring adventurer that he was
if he did not all the while keep his ears open for any fragment of
news that the desultory talk of his fellow-diners was likely to
yield to him.</p>

<p>Politics were, of course, discussed; the tyranny of the
sections, the slavery that this free Republic had brought on its
citizens. The names of the chief personages of the day were all
mentioned in turns Foucquier-Tinville, Santerre, Danton,
Robespierre. Héron and his sleuth-hounds were spoken of with
execrations quickly suppressed, but of little Capet not one
word.</p>

<p>Blakeney could not help but infer that Chauvelin, Héron and the
commissaries in charge were keeping the escape of the child a
secret for as long as they could.</p>

<p>He could hear nothing of Armand's fate, of course. The
arrest&mdash;if arrest there had been&mdash;was not like to be
bruited abroad just now. Blakeney having last seen Armand in
Chauvelin's company, whilst he himself was moving the Simons'
furniture, could not for a moment doubt that the young man was
imprisoned,&mdash;unless, indeed, he was being allowed a certain
measure of freedom, whilst his every step was being spied on, so
that he might act as a decoy for his chief.</p>

<p>At thought of that all weariness seemed to vanish from
Blakeney's powerful frame. He set his lips firmly together, and
once again the light of irresponsible gaiety danced in his
eyes.</p>

<p>He had been in as tight a corner as this before now; at Boulogne
his beautiful Marguerite had been used as a decoy, and twenty-four
hours later he had held her in his arms on board his yacht the
<i>Daydream</i>. As he would have put it in his own forcible
language:</p>

<p>"Those d----d murderers have not got me yet."</p>

<p>The battle mayhap would this time be against greater odds than
before, but Blakeney had no fear that they would prove
overwhelming.</p>

<p>There was in life but one odd that was overwhelming, and that
was treachery.</p>

<p>But of that there could be no question.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>In the afternoon Blakeney started off in search of lodgings for
the night. He found what would suit him in the Rue de l'Arcade,
which was equally far from the House of Justice as it was from his
former lodgings. Here he would be safe for at least twenty-four
hours, after which he might have to shift again. But for the moment
the landlord of the miserable apartment was over-willing to make no
fuss and ask no questions, for the sake of the money which this
aristo in disguise dispensed with a lavish hand.</p>

<p>Having taken possession of his new quarters and snatched a few
hours of sound, well-deserved rest, until the time when the shades
of evening and the darkness of the streets would make progress
through the city somewhat more safe, Blakeney sallied forth at
about six o'clock having a threefold object in view.</p>

<p>Primarily, of course, the threefold object was concentrated on
Armand. There was the possibility of finding out at the young man's
lodgings in Montmartre what had become of him; then there were the
usual inquiries that could be made from the registers of the
various prisons; and, thirdly, there was the chance that Armand had
succeeded in sending some kind of message to Blakeney's former
lodgings in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois.</p>

<p>On the whole, Sir Percy decided to leave the prison registers
alone for the present. If Armand had been actually arrested, he
would almost certainly be confined in the Châtelet prison, where he
would be closer to hand for all the interrogatories to which, no
doubt, he would be subjected.</p>

<p>Blakeney set his teeth and murmured a good, sound, British oath
when he thought of those interrogatories. Armand St. Just, highly
strung, a dreamer and a bundle of nerves&mdash;how he would suffer
under the mental rack of questions and cross-questions,
cleverly-laid traps to catch information from him unawares!</p>

<p>His next objective, then, was Armand's former lodging, and from
six o'clock until close upon eight Sir Percy haunted the slopes of
Montmartre, and more especially the neighbourhood of the Rue de la
Croix Blanche, where Armand had lodged these former days. At the
house itself he could not inquire as yet; obviously it would not
have been safe; tomorrow, perhaps, when he knew more, but not
tonight. His keen eyes had already spied at least two figures
clothed in the rags of out-of-work labourers like himself, who had
hung with suspicious persistence in this same neighbourhood, and
who during the two hours that he had been in observation had never
strayed out of sight of the house in the Rue de la Croix
Blanche.</p>

<p>That these were two spies on the watch was, of course, obvious;
but whether they were on the watch for St. Just or for some other
unfortunate wretch it was at this stage impossible to
conjecture.</p>

<p>Then, as from the Tour des Dames close by the clock solemnly
struck the hour of eight, and Blakeney prepared to wend his way
back to another part of the city, he suddenly saw Armand walking
slowly up the street.</p>

<p>The young man did not look either to right or left; he held his
head forward on his chest, and his hands were hidden underneath his
cloak. When he passed immediately under one of the street lamps
Blakeney caught sight of his face; it was pale and drawn. Then he
turned his head, and for the space of two seconds his eyes across
the narrow street encountered those of his chief. He had the
presence of mind not to make a sign or to utter a sound; he was
obviously being followed, but in that brief moment Sir Percy had
seen in the young man's eyes a look that reminded him of a hunted
creature.</p>

<p>"What have those brutes been up to with him, I wonder?" he
muttered between clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Armand soon disappeared under the doorway of the same house
where he had been lodging all along. Even as he did so Blakeney saw
the two spies gather together like a pair of slimy lizards, and
whisper excitedly one to another. A third man, who obviously had
been dogging Armand's footsteps, came up and joined them after a
while.</p>

<p>Blakeney could have sworn loudly and lustily, had it been
possible to do so without attracting attention. The whole of
Armand's history in the past twenty-four hours was perfectly clear
to him. The young man had been made free that he might prove a
decoy for more important game.</p>

<p>His every step was being watched, and he still thought Jeanne
Lange in immediate danger of death. The look of despair in his face
proclaimed these two facts, and Blakeney's heart ached for the
mental torture which his friend was enduring. He longed to let
Armand know that the woman he loved was in comparative safety.</p>

<p>Jeanne Lange first, and then Armand himself; and the odds would
be very heavy against the Scarlet Pimpernel! But that Marguerite
should not have to mourn an only brother, of that Sir Percy made
oath.</p>

<p>He now turned his steps towards his own former lodgings by St.
Germain l'Auxerrois. It was just possible that Armand had succeeded
in leaving a message there for him. It was, of course, equally
possible that when he did so Héron's men had watched his movements,
and that spies would be stationed there, too, on the watch.</p>

<p>But that risk must, of course, be run. Blakeney's former lodging
was the one place that Armand would know of to which he could send
a message to his chief, if he wanted to do so. Of course, the
unfortunate young man could not have known until just now that
Percy would come back to Paris, but he might guess it, or wish it,
or only vaguely hope for it; he might want to send a message, he
might long to communicate with his brother-in-law, and, perhaps,
feel sure that the latter would not leave him in the lurch.</p>

<p>With that thought in his mind, Sir Percy was not likely to give
up the attempt to ascertain for himself whether Armand had tried to
communicate with him or not. As for spies&mdash;well, he had dodged
some of them often enough in his time&mdash;the risks that he ran
to-night were no worse than the ones to which he had so
successfully run counter in the Temple yesterday.</p>

<p>Still keeping up the slouchy gait peculiar to the out-at-elbows
working man of the day, hugging the houses as he walked along the
streets, Blakeney made slow progress across the city. But at last
he reached the façade of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, and turning
sharply to his right he soon came in sight of the house which he
had only quitted twenty-four hours ago.</p>

<p>We all know that house&mdash;all of us who are familiar with the
Paris of those terrible days. It stands quite detached&mdash;a vast
quadrangle, facing the Quai de l'Ecole and the river, backing on
the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, and shouldering the Carrefour des
Trois Manes. The <i>porte-cocherè</i>, so-called, is but a narrow
doorway, and is actually situated in the Rue St. Germain
l'Auxerrois.</p>

<p>Blakeney made his way cautiously right round the house; he
peered up and down the quay, and his keen eyes tried to pierce the
dense gloom that hung at the corners of the Pont Neuf immediately
opposite. Soon he assured himself that for the present, at any
rate, the house was not being watched.</p>

<p>Armand presumably had not yet left a message for him here; but
he might do so at any time now that he knew that his chief was in
Paris and on the look-out for him.</p>

<p>Blakeney made up his mind to keep this house in sight. This art
of watching he had acquired to a masterly extent, and could have
taught Héron's watch-dogs a remarkable lesson in it. At night, of
course, it was a comparatively easy task. There were a good many
unlighted doorways along the quay, whilst a street lamp was fixed
on a bracket in the wall of the very house which he kept in
observation.</p>

<p>Finding temporary shelter under various doorways, or against the
dank walls of the houses, Blakeney set himself resolutely to a few
hours' weary waiting. A thin, drizzly rain fell with unpleasant
persistence, like a damp mist, and the thin blouse which he wore
soon became wet through and clung hard and chilly to his
shoulders.</p>

<p>It was close on midnight when at last he thought it best to give
up his watch and to go back to his lodgings for a few hours' sleep;
but at seven o'clock the next morning he was back again at his
post.</p>

<p>The <i>porte-cocherè</i> of his former lodging-house was not yet
open; he took up his stand close beside it. His woollen cap pulled
well over his forehead, the grime cleverly plastered on his hair
and face, his lower jaw thrust forward, his eyes looking lifeless
and bleary, all gave him an expression of sly villainy, whilst the
short clay pipe struck at a sharp angle in his mouth, his hands
thrust into the pockets of his ragged breeches, and his bare feet
in the mud of the road, gave the final touch to his representation
of an out-of-work, ill-conditioned, and supremely discontented
loafer.</p>

<p>He had not very long to wait. Soon the <i>porte-cocherè</i> of
the house was opened, and the concierge came out with his broom,
making a show of cleaning the pavement in front of the door. Five
minutes later a lad, whose clothes consisted entirely of rags, and
whose feet and head were bare, came rapidly up the street from the
quay, and walked along looking at the houses as he went, as if
trying to decipher their number. The cold grey dawn was just
breaking, dreary and damp, as all the past days had been. Blakeney
watched the lad as he approached, the small, naked feet falling
noiselessly on the cobblestones of the road. When the boy was quite
close to him and to the house, Blakeney shifted his position and
took the pipe out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Up early, my son!" he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the pale-faced little creature; "I have a message to
deliver at No. 9 Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois. It must be somewhere
near here."</p>

<p>"It is. You can give me the message."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, citizen!" said the lad, into whose pale, circled eyes a
look of terror had quickly appeared. "It is for one of the lodgers
in No. 9. I must give it to him."</p>

<p>With an instinct which he somehow felt could not err at this
moment, Blakeney knew that the message was one from Armand to
himself; a written message, too, since&mdash;instinctively when he
spoke&mdash;the boy clutched at his thin shirt, as if trying to
guard something precious that had been entrusted to him.</p>

<p>"I will deliver the message myself, sonny," said Blakeney
gruffly. "I know the citizen for whom it is intended. He would not
like the concierge to see it."</p>

<p>"Oh! I would not give it to the concierge," said the boy. "I
would take it upstairs myself."</p>

<p>"My son," retorted Blakeney, "let me tell you this. You are
going to give that message up to me and I will put five whole
livres into your hand."</p>

<p>Blakeney, with all his sympathy aroused for this poor pale-faced
lad, put on the airs of a ruffianly bully. He did not wish that
message to be taken indoors by the lad, for the concierge might get
hold of it, despite the boy's protests and tears, and after that
Blakeney would perforce have to disclose himself before it would be
given up to him. During the past week the concierge had been very
amenable to bribery. Whatever suspicions he had had about his
lodger he had kept to himself for the sake of the money which he
received; but it was impossible to gauge any man's trend of thought
these days from one hour to the next. Something&mdash;for aught
Blakeney knew&mdash;might have occurred in the past twenty-four
hours to change an amiable and accommodating lodging-house keeper
into a surly or dangerous spy.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the concierge had once more gone within; there was
no one abroad, and if there were, no one probably would take any
notice of a burly ruffian brow-beating a child.</p>

<p>"<i>Allons!</i>" he said gruffly, "give me the letter, or that
five livres goes back into my pocket."</p>

<p>"Five livres!" exclaimed the child with pathetic eagerness. "Oh,
citizen!"</p>

<p>The thin little hand fumbled under the rags, but it reappeared
again empty, whilst a faint blush spread over the hollow
cheeks.</p>

<p>"The other citizen also gave me five livres," he said humbly.
"He lodges in the house where my mother is concierge. It is in the
Rue de la Croix Blanche. He has been very kind to my mother. I
would rather do as he bade me."</p>

<p>"Bless the lad," murmured Blakeney under his breath; "his
loyalty redeems many a crime of this God-forsaken city. Now I
suppose I shall have to bully him, after all."</p>

<p>He took his hand out of his breeches pocket; between two very
dirty fingers he held a piece of gold. The other hand he placed
quite roughly on the lad's chest.</p>

<p>"Give me the letter," he said harshly, "or&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pulled at the ragged blouse, and a scrap of soiled paper soon
fell into his hand. The lad began to cry.</p>

<p>"Here," said Blakeney, thrusting the piece of gold into the thin
small palm, "take this home to your mother, and tell your lodger
that a big, rough man took the letter away from you by force. Now
run, before I kick you out of the way."</p>

<p>The lad, terrified out of his poor wits, did not wait for
further commands; he took to his heels and ran, his small hand
clutching the piece of gold. Soon he had disappeared round the
corner of the street.</p>

<p>Blakeney did not at once read the paper; he thrust it quickly
into his breeches pocket and slouched away slowly down the street,
and thence across the Place du Carrousel, in the direction of his
new lodgings in the Rue de l'Arcade.</p>

<p>It was only when he found himself alone in the narrow, squalid
room which he was occupying that he took the scrap of paper from
his pocket and read it slowly through. It said:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Percy, you cannot forgive me, nor can I ever
forgive myself, but if you only knew what I have suffered for the
past two days you would, I think, try and forgive. I am free and
yet a prisoner; my every footstep is dogged. What they ultimately
mean to do with me I do not know. And when I think of Jeanne I long
for the power to end mine own miserable existence. Percy! she is
still in the hands of those fiends...I saw the prison register; her
name written there has been like a burning brand on my heart ever
since. She was still in prison the day that you left Paris;
to-morrow, to-night mayhap, they will try her, condemn her, torture
her, and I dare not go to see you, for I would only be bringing
spies to your door. But will you come to me, Percy? It should be
safe in the hours of the night, and the concierge is devoted to me.
To-night at ten o'clock she will leave the <i>porte-cocherè</i>
unlatched. If you find it so, and if on the ledge of the window
immediately on your left as you enter you find a candle alight, and
beside it a scrap of paper with your initials S. P. traced on it,
then it will be quite safe for you to come up to my room. It is on
the second landing&mdash;a door on your right&mdash;that too I will
leave on the latch. But in the name of the woman you love best in
all the world come at once to me then, and bear in mind, Percy,
that the woman I love is threatened with immediate death, and that
I am powerless to save her. Indeed, believe me, I would gladly die
even now but for the thought of Jeanne, whom I should be leaving in
the hands of those fiends. For God's sake, Percy, remember that
Jeanne is all the world to me.</p>

<p>"Poor old Armand," murmured Blakeney with a kindly smile
directed at the absent friend, "he won't trust me even now. He
won't trust his Jeanne in my hands. Well," he added after a while,
"after all, I would not entrust Marguerite to anybody else
either."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23. The Overwhelming
Odds</h2>

<p>At half-past ten that same evening, Blakeney, still clad in a
workman's tattered clothes, his feet bare so that he could tread
the streets unheard, turned into the Rue de la Croix Blanche.</p>

<p>The <i>porte-cocherè</i> of the house where Armand lodged had
been left on the latch; not a soul was in sight. Peering cautiously
round, he slipped into the house. On the ledge of the window,
immediately on his left when he entered, a candle was left burning,
and beside it there was a scrap of paper with the initials S.P.
roughly traced in pencil. No one challenged him as he noiselessly
glided past it, and up the narrow stairs that led to the upper
floor. Here, too, on the second landing the door on the right had
been left on the latch. He pushed it open and entered.</p>

<p>As is usual even in the meanest lodgings in Paris houses, a
small antechamber gave between the front door and the main room.
When Percy entered the antechamber was unlighted, but the door into
the inner room beyond was ajar. Blakeney approached it with
noiseless tread, and gently pushed it open.</p>

<p>That very instant he knew that the game was up; he heard the
footsteps closing up behind him, saw Armand, deathly pale, leaning
against the wall in the room in front of him, and Chauvelin and
Héron standing guard over him.</p>

<p>The next moment the room and the antechamber were literally
alive with soldiers&mdash;twenty of them to arrest one man.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of that man that when hands were laid on
him from every side he threw back his head and
laughed&mdash;laughed mirthfully, light-heartedly, and the first
words that escaped his lips were:</p>

<p>"Well, I am d----d!"</p>

<p>"The odds are against you, Sir Percy," said Chauvelin to him in
English, whilst Héron at the further end of the room was growling
like a contented beast.</p>

<p>"By the Lord, sir," said Percy with perfect <i>sangfroid</i>, "I
do believe that for the moment they are."</p>

<p>"Have done, my men&mdash;have done!" he added, turning
good-humouredly to the soldiers round him. "I never fight against
overwhelming odds. Twenty to one, eh? I could lay four of you out
easily enough, perhaps even six, but what then?"</p>

<p>But a kind of savage lust seemed to have rendered these men
temporarily mad, and they were being egged on by Héron. The
mysterious Englishman, about whom so many eerie tales were told!
Well, he had supernatural powers, and twenty to one might be
nothing to him if the devil was on his side. Therefore a blow on
his forearm with the butt-end of a bayonet was useful for disabling
his right hand, and soon the left arm with a dislocated shoulder
hung limp by his side. Then he was bound with cords.</p>

<p>The vein of luck had given out. The gambler had staked more than
usual and had lost; but he knew how to lose, just as he had always
known how to win.</p>

<p>"Those d----d brutes are trussing me like a fowl," he murmured
with irrepressible gaiety at the last.</p>

<p>Then the wrench on his bruised arms as they were pulled roughly
back by the cords caused the veil of unconsciousness to gather over
his eyes.</p>

<p>"And Jeanne was safe, Armand," he shouted with a last desperate
effort; "those devils have lied to you and tricked you into this
... Since yesterday she is out of prison...in the house...you
know..."</p>

<p>After that he lost consciousness.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>And this occurred on Tuesday, January 21st, in the year 1794,
or, in accordance with the new calendar, on the 2nd Pluviôse, year
II of the Republic.</p>

<p>It is chronicled in the <i>Moniteur</i> of the 3rd Pluviôse
that, "on the previous evening, at half-past ten of the clock, the
Englishman known as the Scarlet Pimpernel, who for three years has
conspired against the safety of the Republic, was arrested through
the patriotic exertions of citizen Chauvelin, and conveyed to the
Conciergerie, where he now lies&mdash;sick, but closely guarded.
Long live the Republic!"</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24. The News</h2>

<p>The grey January day was falling, drowsy, and dull into the arms
of night.</p>

<p>Marguerite, sitting in the dusk beside the fire in her small
boudoir, shivered a little as she drew her scarf closer round her
shoulders.</p>

<p>Edwards, the butler, entered with the lamp. The room looked
peculiarly cheery now, with the delicate white panelling of the
wall glowing under the soft kiss of the flickering firelight and
the steadier glow of the rose-shaded lamp.</p>

<p>"Has the courier not arrived yet, Edwards?" asked Marguerite,
fixing the impassive face of the well-drilled servant with her
large purple-rimmed eyes.</p>

<p>"Not yet, m'lady," he replied placidly.</p>

<p>"It is his day, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'lady. And the forenoon is his time. But there have been
heavy rains, and the roads must be rare muddy. He must have been
delayed, m'lady."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," she said listlessly. "That will do,
Edwards. No, don't close the shutters. I'll ring presently."</p>

<p>The man went out of the room as automatically as he had come. He
closed the door behind him, and Marguerite was once more alone.</p>

<p>She picked up the book which she had fingered idly before the
light gave out. She tried once more to fix her attention on this
tale of love and adventure written by Mr. Fielding; but she had
lost the thread of the story, and there was a mist between her eyes
and the printed pages.</p>

<p>With an impatient gesture she threw down the book and passed her
hand across her eyes, then seemed astonished to find that her hand
was wet.</p>

<p>She rose and went to the window. The air outside had been
singularly mild all day; the thaw was persisting, and a south wind
came across the Channel&mdash;from France.</p>

<p>Marguerite threw open the casement and sat down on the wide
sill, leaning her head against the window-frame, and gazing out
into the fast gathering gloom. From far away, at the foot of the
gently sloping lawns, the river murmured softly in the night; in
the borders to the right and left a few snowdrops still showed like
tiny white specks through the surrounding darkness. Winter had
begun the process of slowly shedding its mantle, coquetting with
Spring, who still lingered in the land of Infinity. Gradually the
shadows drew closer and closer; the reeds and rushes on the river
bank were the first to sink into their embrace, then the big cedars
on the lawn, majestic and defiant, but yielding still unconquered
to the power of night.</p>

<p>The tiny stars of snowdrop blossoms vanished one by one, and at
last the cool, grey ribbon of the river surface was wrapped under
the mantle of evening.</p>

<p>Only the south wind lingered on, soughing gently in the drowsy
reeds, whispering among the branches of the cedars, and gently
stirring the tender corollas of the sleeping snowdrops.</p>

<p>Marguerite seemed to open out her lungs to its breath. It had
come all the way from France, and on its wings had brought
something of Percy&mdash;a murmur as if he had spoken&mdash;a
memory that was as intangible as a dream.</p>

<p>She shivered again, though of a truth it was not cold. The
courier's delay had completely unsettled her nerves. Twice a week
he came especially from Dover, and always he brought some message,
some token which Percy had contrived to send from Paris. They were
like tiny scraps of dry bread thrown to a starving woman, but they
did just help to keep her heart alive&mdash;that poor, aching,
disappointed heart that so longed for enduring happiness which it
could never get.</p>

<p>The man whom she loved with all her soul, her mind and her body,
did not belong to her; he belonged to suffering humanity over there
in terror-stricken France, where the cries of the innocent, the
persecuted, the wretched called louder to him than she in her love
could do.</p>

<p>He had been away three months now, during which time her
starving heart had fed on its memories, and the happiness of a
brief visit from him six weeks ago, when&mdash;quite
unexpectedly&mdash;he had appeared before her...home between two
desperate adventures that had given life and freedom to a number of
innocent people, and nearly cost him his&mdash;and she had lain in
his arms in a swoon of perfect happiness.</p>

<p>But he had gone away again as suddenly as he had come, and for
six weeks now she had lived partly in anticipation of the courier
with messages from him, and partly on the fitful joy engendered by
these messages. To-day she had not even that, and the
disappointment seemed just now more than she could bear.</p>

<p>She felt unaccountably restless, and could she but have analysed
her feelings&mdash;had she dared so to do&mdash;she would have
realised that the weight which oppressed her heart so that she
could hardly breathe, was one of vague yet dark foreboding.</p>

<p>She closed the window and returned to her seat by the fire,
taking up her book with the strong resolution not to allow her
nerves to get the better of her. But it was difficult to pin one's
attention down to the adventures of Master Tom Jones when one's
mind was fully engrossed with those of Sir Percy Blakeney.</p>

<p>The sound of carriage wheels on the gravelled forecourt in the
front of the house suddenly awakened her drowsy senses. She threw
down the book, and with trembling hands clutched the arms of her
chair, straining her ears to listen. A carriage at this
hour&mdash;and on this damp winter's evening! She racked her mind
wondering who it could be.</p>

<p>Lady Ffoulkes was in London, she knew. Sir Andrew, of course,
was in Paris. His Royal Highness, ever a faithful visitor, would
surely not venture out to Richmond in this inclement
weather&mdash;and the courier always came on horseback.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of voices; that of Edwards, mechanical and
placid, could be heard quite distinctly saying:</p>

<p>"I'm sure that her ladyship will be at home for you, m'lady. But
I'll go and ascertain."</p>

<p>Marguerite ran to the door and with joyful eagerness tore it
open.</p>

<p>"Suzanne!" she called "my little Suzanne! I thought you were in
London. Come up quickly! In the boudoir&mdash;yes. Oh! what good
fortune hath brought you?"</p>

<p>Suzanne flew into her arms, holding the friend whom she loved so
well close and closer to her heart, trying to hide her face, which
was wet with tears, in the folds of Marguerite's kerchief.</p>

<p>"Come inside, my darling," said Marguerite. "Why, how cold your
little hands are!"</p>

<p>She was on the point of turning back to her boudoir, drawing
Lady Ffoulkes by the hand, when suddenly she caught sight of Sir
Andrew, who stood at a little distance from her, at the top of the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Sir Andrew!" she exclaimed with unstinted gladness.</p>

<p>Then she paused. The cry of welcome died on her lips, leaving
them dry and parted. She suddenly felt as if some fearful talons
had gripped her heart and were tearing at it with sharp, long
nails; the blood flew from her cheeks and from her limbs, leaving
her with a sense of icy numbness.</p>

<p>She backed into the room, still holding Suzanne's hand, and
drawing her in with her. Sir Andrew followed them, then closed the
door behind him. At last the word escaped Marguerite's parched
lips:</p>

<p>"Percy! Something has happened to him! He is dead?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Sir Andrew quickly.</p>

<p>Suzanne put her loving arms round her friend and drew her down
into the chair by the fire. She knelt at her feet on the hearthrug,
and pressed her own burning lips on Marguerite's icy-cold hands.
Sir Andrew stood silently by, a world of loving friendship, of
heart-broken sorrow, in his eyes.</p>

<p>There was silence in the pretty white-panelled room for a while.
Marguerite sat with her eyes closed, bringing the whole armoury of
her will power to bear her up outwardly now.</p>

<p>"Tell me!" she said at last, and her voice was toneless and
dull, like one that came from the depths of a grave&mdash;"tell
me&mdash;exactly&mdash;everything. Don't be afraid. I can bear it.
Don't be afraid."</p>

<p>Sir Andrew remained standing, with bowed head and one hand
resting on the table. In a firm, clear voice he told her the events
of the past few days as they were known to him. All that he tried
to hide was Armand's disobedience, which, in his heart, he felt was
the primary cause of the catastrophe. He told of the rescue of the
Dauphin from the Temple, the midnight drive in the coal-cart, the
meeting with Hastings and Tony in the spinney. He only gave vague
explanations of Armand's stay in Paris which caused Percy to go
back to the city, even at the moment when his most daring plan had
been so successfully carried through.</p>

<p>"Armand, I understand, has fallen in love with a beautiful woman
in Paris, Lady Blakeney," he said, seeing that a strange, puzzled
look had appeared in Marguerite's pale face. "She was arrested the
day before the rescue of the Dauphin from the Temple. Armand could
not join us. He felt that he could not leave her. I am sure that
you will understand."</p>

<p>Then as she made no comment, he resumed his narrative:</p>

<p>"I had been ordered to go back to La Villette, and there to
resume my duties as a labourer in the day-time, and to wait for
Percy during the night. The fact that I had received no message
from him for two days had made me somewhat worried, but I have such
faith in him, such belief in his good luck and his ingenuity, that
I would not allow myself to be really anxious. Then on the third
day I heard the news."</p>

<p>"What news?" asked Marguerite mechanically.</p>

<p>"That the Englishman who was known as the Scarlet Pimpernel had
been captured in a house in the Rue de la Croix Blanche, and had
been imprisoned in the Conciergerie."</p>

<p>"The Rue de la Croix Blanche? Where is that?"</p>

<p>"In the Montmartre quarter. Armand lodged there. Percy, I
imagine, was working to get him away; and those brutes captured
him."</p>

<p>"Having heard the news, Sir Andrew, what did you do?"</p>

<p>"I went into Paris and ascertained its truth."</p>

<p>"And there is no doubt of it?"</p>

<p>"Alas, none! I went to the house in the Rue de la Croix Blanche.
Armand had disappeared. I succeeded in inducing the concierge to
talk. She seems to have been devoted to her lodger. Amidst tears
she told me some of the details of the capture. Can you bear to
hear them, Lady Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;tell me everything&mdash;don't be afraid," she
reiterated with the same dull monotony.</p>

<p>"It appears that early on the Tuesday morning the son of the
concierge&mdash;a lad about fifteen&mdash;was sent off by her
lodger with a message to No. 9 Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois. That
was the house where Percy was staying all last week, where he kept
disguises and so on for us all, and where some of our meetings were
held. Percy evidently expected that Armand would try and
communicate with him at that address, for when the lad arrived in
front of the house he was accosted&mdash;so he says&mdash;by a big,
rough workman, who browbeat him into giving up the lodger's letter,
and finally pressed a piece of gold into his hand. The workman was
Blakeney, of course. I imagine that Armand, at the time that he
wrote the letter, must have been under the belief that Mademoiselle
Lange was still in prison; he could not know then that Blakeney had
already got her into comparative safety. In the letter he must have
spoken of the terrible plight in which he stood, and also of his
fears for the woman whom he loved. Percy was not the man to leave a
comrade in the lurch! He would not be the man whom we all love and
admire, whose word we all obey, for whose sake we would gladly all
of us give our life&mdash;he would not be that man if he did not
brave even certain dangers in order to be of help to those who call
on him. Armand called and Percy went to him. He must have known
that Armand was being spied upon, for Armand, alas! was already a
marked man, and the watch-dogs of those infernal committees were
already on his heels. Whether these sleuth-hounds had followed the
son of the concierge and seen him give the letter to the workman in
the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, or whether the concierge in the
Rue de la Croix Blanche was nothing but a spy of Héron's, or, again
whether the Committee of General Security kept a company of
soldiers in constant alert in that house, we shall, of course,
never know. All that I do know is that Percy entered that fatal
house at half-past ten, and that a quarter of an hour later the
concierge saw some of the soldiers descending the stairs, carrying
a heavy burden. She peeped out of her lodge, and by the light in
the corridor she saw that the heavy burden was the body of a man
bound closely with ropes: his eyes were closed, his clothes were
stained with blood. He was seemingly unconscious. The next day the
official organ of the Government proclaimed the capture of the
Scarlet Pimpernel, and there was a public holiday in honour of the
event."</p>

<p>Marguerite had listened to this terrible narrative dry-eyed and
silent. Now she still sat there, hardly conscious of what went on
around her&mdash;of Suzanne's tears, that fell unceasingly upon her
fingers&mdash;of Sir Andrew, who had sunk into a chair, and buried
his head in his hands. She was hardly conscious that she lived; the
universe seemed to have stood still before this awful, monstrous
cataclysm.</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, she was the first to return to the active
realities of the present.</p>

<p>"Sir Andrew," she said after a while, "tell me, where are my
Lords Tony and Hastings?"</p>

<p>"At Calais, madam," he replied. "I saw them there on my way
hither. They had delivered the Dauphin safely into the hands of his
adherents at Mantes, and were awaiting Blakeney's further orders,
as he had commanded them to do."</p>

<p>"Will they wait for us there, think you?"</p>

<p>"For us, Lady Blakeney?" he exclaimed in puzzlement.</p>

<p>"Yes, for us, Sir Andrew," she replied, whilst the ghost of a
smile flitted across her drawn face; "you had thought of
accompanying me to Paris, had you not?"</p>

<p>"But Lady Blakeney&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! I know what you would say, Sir Andrew. You will speak of
dangers, of risks, of death, mayhap; you will tell me that I as a
woman can do nothing to help my husband&mdash;that I could be but a
hindrance to him, just as I was in Boulogne. But everything is so
different now. Whilst those brutes planned his capture he was
clever enough to outwit them, but now they have actually got him,
think you they'll let him escape? They'll watch him night and day,
my friend, just as they watched the unfortunate Queen; but they'll
not keep him months, weeks, or even days in prison&mdash;even
Chauvelin now will no longer attempt to play with the Scarlet
Pimpernel. They have him, and they will hold him until such time as
they take him to the guillotine."</p>

<p>Her voice broke in a sob; her self-control was threatening to
leave her. She was but a woman, young and passionately in love with
the man who was about to die an ignominious death, far away from
his country, his kindred, his friends.</p>

<p>"I cannot let him die alone, Sir Andrew; he will be longing for
me, and&mdash;and, after all, there is you, and my Lord Tony, and
Lord Hastings and the others; surely&mdash;surely we are not going
to let him die, not like that, and not alone."</p>

<p>"You are right, Lady Blakeney," said Sir Andrew earnestly; "we
are not going to let him die, if human agency can do aught to save
him. Already Tony, Hastings and I have agreed to return to Paris.
There are one or two hidden places in and around the city known
only to Percy and to the members of the League where he must find
one or more of us if he succeeds in getting away. All the way
between Paris and Calais we have places of refuge, places where any
of us can hide at a given moment; where we can find disguises when
we want them, or horses in an emergency. No! no! we are not going
to despair, Lady Blakeney; there are nineteen of us prepared to lay
down our lives for the Scarlet Pimpernel. Already I, as his
lieutenant, have been selected as the leader of as determined a
gang as has ever entered on a work of rescue before. We leave for
Paris to-morrow, and if human pluck and devotion can destroy
mountains then we'll destroy them. Our watchword is: 'God save the
Scarlet Pimpernel.'"</p>

<p>He knelt beside her chair and kissed the cold fingers which,
with a sad little smile, she held out to him.</p>

<p>"And God bless you all!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Suzanne had risen to her feet when her husband knelt; now he
stood up beside her. The dainty young woman hardly more than a
child&mdash;was doing her best to restrain her tears.</p>

<p>"See how selfish I am," said Marguerite. "I talk calmly of
taking your husband from you, when I myself know the bitterness of
such partings."</p>

<p>"My husband will go where his duty calls him," said Suzanne with
charming and simple dignity. "I love him with all my heart, because
he is brave and good. He could not leave his comrade, who is also
his chief, in the lurch. God will protect him, I know. I would not
ask him to play the part of a coward."</p>

<p>Her brown eyes glowed with pride. She was the true wife of a
soldier, and with all her dainty ways and childlike manners she was
a splendid woman and a staunch friend. Sir Percy Blakeney had saved
her entire family from death, the Comte and Comtesse de Tournai,
the Vicomte, her brother, and she herself all owed their lives to
the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>This she was not like to forget.</p>

<p>"There is but little danger for us, I fear me," said Sir Andrew
lightly; "the revolutionary Government only wants to strike at a
head, it cares nothing for the limbs. Perhaps it feels that without
our leader we are enemies not worthy of persecution. If there are
any dangers, so much the better," he added; "but I don't anticipate
any, unless we succeed in freeing our chief; and having freed him,
we fear nothing more."</p>

<p>"The same applies to me, Sir Andrew," rejoined Marguerite
earnestly. "Now that they have captured Percy, those human fiends
will care naught for me. If you succeed in freeing Percy I, like
you, will have nothing more to fear, and if you fail&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused and put her small, white hand on Sir Andrew's
arm.</p>

<p>"Take me with you, Sir Andrew," she entreated; "do not condemn
me to the awful torture of weary waiting, day after day, wondering,
guessing, never daring to hope, lest hope deferred be more hard to
bear than dreary hopelessness."</p>

<p>Then as Sir Andrew, very undecided, yet half inclined to yield,
stood silent and irresolute, she pressed her point, gently but
firmly insistent.</p>

<p>"I would not be in the way, Sir Andrew; I would know how to
efface myself so as not to interfere with your plans. But, oh!" she
added, while a quivering note of passion trembled in her voice,
"can't you see that I must breathe the air that he breathes else I
shall stifle or mayhap go mad?"</p>

<p>Sir Andrew turned to his wife, a mute query in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You would do an inhuman and a cruel act," said Suzanne with
seriousness that sat quaintly on her baby face, "if you did not
afford your protection to Marguerite, for I do believe that if you
did not take her with you to-morrow she would go to Paris
alone."</p>

<p>Marguerite thanked her friend with her eyes. Suzanne was a child
in nature, but she had a woman's heart. She loved her husband, and,
therefore, knew and understood what Marguerite must be suffering
now.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew no longer could resist the unfortunate woman's
earnest pleading. Frankly, he thought that if she remained in
England while Percy was in such deadly peril she ran the grave risk
of losing her reason before the terrible strain of suspense. He
knew her to be a woman of courage, and one capable of great
physical endurance; and really he was quite honest when he said
that he did not believe there would be much danger for the headless
League of the Scarlet Pimpernel unless they succeeded in freeing
their chief. And if they did succeed, then indeed there would be
nothing to fear, for the brave and loving wife who, like every true
woman does, and has done in like circumstances since the beginning
of time, was only demanding with passionate insistence the right to
share the fate, good or ill, of the man whom she loved.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter 25. Paris Once More</h2>

<p>Sir Andrew had just come in. He was trying to get a little
warmth into his half-frozen limbs, for the cold had set in again,
and this time with renewed vigour, and Marguerite was pouring out a
cup of hot coffee which she had been brewing for him. She had not
asked for news. She knew that he had none to give her, else he had
not worn that wearied, despondent look in his kind face.</p>

<p>"I'll just try one more place this evening," he said as soon as
he had swallowed some of the hot coffee&mdash;"a restaurant in the
Rue de la Harpe; the members of the Cordeliers' Club often go there
for supper, and they are usually well informed. I might glean
something definite there."</p>

<p>"It seems very strange that they are so slow in bringing him to
trial," said Marguerite in that dull, toneless voice which had
become habitual to her. "When you first brought me the awful news
that...I was sure that they would bring him to trial at once, and
was in terror lest we arrived here too late to&mdash;to see
him."</p>

<p>She checked herself quickly, bravely trying to still the quiver
of her voice.</p>

<p>"And of Armand?" she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"With regard to him I am at a still greater loss," he said: "I
cannot find his name on any of the prison registers, and I know
that he is not in the Conciergerie. They have cleared out all the
prisoners from there; there is only Percy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor Armand!" she sighed; "it must be almost worse for him than
for any of us; it was his first act of thoughtless disobedience
that brought all this misery upon our heads."</p>

<p>She spoke sadly but quietly. Sir Andrew noted that there was no
bitterness in her tone. But her very quietude was heart-breaking;
there was such an infinity of despair in the calm of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well! though we cannot understand it all, Lady Blakeney," he
said with forced cheerfulness, "we must remember one
thing&mdash;that whilst there is life there is hope."</p>

<p>"Hope!" she exclaimed with a world of pathos in her sigh, her
large eyes dry and circled, fixed with indescribable sorrow on her
friend's face.</p>

<p>Ffoulkes turned his head away, pretending to busy himself with
the coffee-making utensils. He could not bear to see that look of
hopelessness in her face, for in his heart he could not find the
wherewithal to cheer her. Despair was beginning to seize on him
too, and this he would not let her see.</p>

<p>They had been in Paris three days now, and it was six days since
Blakeney had been arrested. Sir Andrew and Marguerite had found
temporary lodgings inside Paris, Tony and Hastings were just
outside the gates, and all along the route between Paris and
Calais, at St. Germain, at Mantes, in the villages between Beauvais
and Amiens, wherever money could obtain friendly help, members of
the devoted League of the Scarlet Pimpernel lay in hiding, waiting
to aid their chief.</p>

<p>Ffoulkes had ascertained that Percy was kept a close prisoner in
the Conciergerie, in the very rooms occupied by Marie Antoinette
during the last months of her life. He left poor Marguerite to
guess how closely that elusive Scarlet Pimpernel was being guarded,
the precautions surrounding him being even more minute than those
which had made the unfortunate Queen's closing days a martyrdom for
her.</p>

<p>But of Armand he could glean no satisfactory news, only the
negative probability that he was not detained in any of the larger
prisons of Paris, as no register which he, Ffoulkes, so laboriously
consulted bore record of the name of St. Just.</p>

<p>Haunting the restaurants and drinking booths where the most
advanced Jacobins and Terrorists were wont to meet, he had learned
one or two details of Blakeney's incarceration which he could not
possibly impart to Marguerite. The capture of the mysterious
Englishman known as the Scarlet Pimpernel had created a great deal
of popular satisfaction; but it was obvious that not only was the
public mind not allowed to associate that capture with the escape
of little Capet from the Temple, but it soon became clear to
Ffoulkes that the news of that escape was still being kept a
profound secret.</p>

<p>On one occasion he had succeeded in spying on the Chief Agent of
the Committee of General Security, whom he knew by sight, while the
latter was sitting at dinner in the company of a stout, florid man
with pock-marked face and podgy hands covered with rings.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew marvelled who this man might be. Héron spoke to him
in ambiguous phrases that would have been unintelligible to any one
who did not know the circumstances of the Dauphin's escape and the
part that the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel had played in it. But
to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, who&mdash;cleverly disguised as a farrier,
grimy after his day's work&mdash;was straining his ears to listen
whilst apparently consuming huge slabs of boiled beef, it soon
became clear that the chief agent and his fat friend were talking
of the Dauphin and of Blakeney.</p>

<p>"He won't hold out much longer, citizen," the chief agent was
saying in a confident voice; "our men are absolutely unremitting in
their task. Two of them watch him night and day; they look after
him well, and practically never lose sight of him, but the moment
he tries to get any sleep one of them rushes into the cell with a
loud banging of bayonet and sabre, and noisy tread on the
flagstones, and shouts at the top of his voice: 'Now then, aristo,
where's the brat? Tell us now, and you shall be down and go to
sleep.' I have done it myself all through one day just for the
pleasure of it. It's a little tiring for you to have to shout a
good deal now, and sometimes give the cursed Englishman a good
shake-up. He has had five days of it, and not one wink of sleep
during that time&mdash;not one single minute of rest&mdash;and he
only gets enough food to keep him alive. I tell you he can't last.
Citizen Chauvelin had a splendid idea there. It will all come right
in a day or two."</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted the other sulkily; "those Englishmen are
tough."</p>

<p>"Yes!" retorted Héron with a grim laugh and a leer of savagery
that made his gaunt face look positively hideous&mdash;"you would
have given out after three days, friend de Batz, would you not? And
I warned you, didn't I? I told you if you tampered with the brat I
would make you cry in mercy to me for death."</p>

<p>"And I warned you," said the other imperturbably, "not to worry
so much about me, but to keep your eyes open for those cursed
Englishmen."</p>

<p>"I am keeping my eyes open for you, nevertheless, my friend. If
I thought you knew where the vermin's spawn was at this moment I
would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would put me on the same rack that you or your precious
friend, Chauvelin, have devised for the Englishman. But I don't
know where the lad is. If I did I would not be in Paris."</p>

<p>"I know that," assented Héron with a sneer; "you would soon be
after the reward&mdash;over in Austria, what?&mdash;but I have your
movements tracked day and night, my friend. I dare say you are as
anxious as we are as to the whereabouts of the child. Had he been
taken over the frontier you would have been the first to hear of
it, eh? No," he added confidently, and as if anxious to reassure
himself, "my firm belief is that the original idea of these
confounded Englishmen was to try and get the child over to England,
and that they alone know where he is. I tell you it won't be many
days before that very withered Scarlet Pimpernel will order his
followers to give little Capet up to us. Oh! they are hanging about
Paris some of them, I know that; citizen Chauvelin is convinced
that the wife isn't very far away. Give her a sight of her husband
now, say I, and she'll make the others give the child up soon
enough."</p>

<p>The man laughed like some hyena gloating over its prey. Sir
Andrew nearly betrayed himself then. He had to dig his nails into
his own flesh to prevent himself from springing then and there at
the throat of that wretch whose monstrous ingenuity had invented
torture for the fallen enemy far worse than any that the cruelties
of medieval Inquisitions had devised.</p>

<p>So they would not let him sleep! A simple idea born in the brain
of a fiend. Héron had spoken of Chauvelin as the originator of the
devilry; a man weakened deliberately day by day by insufficient
food, and the horrible process of denying him rest. It seemed
inconceivable that human, sentient beings should have thought of
such a thing. Perspiration stood up in beads on Sir Andrew's brow
when he thought of his friend, brought down by want of sleep
to&mdash;what? His physique was splendidly powerful, but could it
stand against such racking torment for long? And the clear, the
alert mind, the scheming brain, the reckless daring&mdash;how soon
would these become enfeebled by the slow, steady torture of an
utter want of rest?</p>

<p>Ffoulkes had to smother a cry of horror, which surely must have
drawn the attention of that fiend on himself had he not been so
engrossed in the enjoyment of his own devilry. As it is, he ran out
of the stuffy eating-house, for he felt as if its fetid air must
choke him.</p>

<p>For an hour after that he wandered about the streets, not daring
to face Marguerite, lest his eyes betrayed some of the horror which
was shaking his very soul.</p>

<p>That was twenty-four hours ago. To-day he had learnt little
else. It was generally known that the Englishman was in the
Conciergerie prison, that he was being closely watched, and that
his trial would come on within the next few days; but no one seemed
to know exactly when. The public was getting restive, demanding
that trial and execution to which every one seemed to look forward
as to a holiday. In the meanwhile the escape of the Dauphin had
been kept from the knowledge of the public; Héron and his gang,
fearing for their lives, had still hopes of extracting from the
Englishman the secret of the lad's hiding-place, and the means they
employed for arriving at this end was worthy of Lucifer and his
host of devils in hell.</p>

<p>From other fragments of conversation which Sir Andrew Ffoulkes
had gleaned that same evening, it seemed to him that in order to
hide their defalcations Héron and the four commissaries in charge
of little Capet had substituted a deaf and dumb child for the
escaped little prisoner. This miserable small wreck of humanity was
reputed to be sick and kept in a darkened room, in bed, and was in
that condition exhibited to any member of the Convention who had
the right to see him. A partition had been very hastily erected in
the inner room once occupied by the Simons, and the child was kept
behind that partition, and no one was allowed to come too near to
him. Thus the fraud was succeeding fairly well. Héron and his
accomplices only cared to save their skins, and the wretched little
substitute being really ill, they firmly hoped that he would soon
die, when no doubt they would bruit abroad the news of the death of
Capet, which would relieve them of further responsibility.</p>

<p>That such ideas, such thoughts, such schemes should have
engendered in human minds it is almost impossible to conceive, and
yet we know from no less important a witness than Madame Simon
herself that the child who died in the Temple a few weeks later was
a poor little imbecile, a deaf and dumb child brought hither from
one of the asylums and left to die in peace. There was nobody but
kindly Death to take him out of his misery, for the giant intellect
that had planned and carried out the rescue of the uncrowned King
of France, and which alone might have had the power to save him
too, was being broken on the rack of enforced sleeplessness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26. The Bitterest Foe</h2>

<p>That same evening Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, having announced his
intention of gleaning further news of Armand, if possible, went out
shortly after seven o'clock, promising to be home again about
nine.</p>

<p>Marguerite, on the other hand, had to make her friend a solemn
promise that she would try and eat some supper which the landlady
of these miserable apartments had agreed to prepare for her. So far
they had been left in peaceful occupation of these squalid lodgings
in a tumble-down house on the Quai de la Ferraille, facing the
house of Justice, the grim walls of which Marguerite would watch
with wide-open dry eyes for as long as the grey wintry light
lingered over them.</p>

<p>Even now, though the darkness had set in, and snow, falling in
close, small flakes, threw a thick white veil over the landscape,
she sat at the open window long after Sir Andrew had gone out,
watching the few small flicks of light that blinked across from the
other side of the river, and which came from the windows of the
Châtelet towers. The windows of the Conciergerie she could not see,
for these gave on one of the inner courtyards; but there was a
melancholy consolation even in the gazing on those walls that held
in their cruel, grim embrace all that she loved in the world.</p>

<p>It seemed so impossible to think of Percy&mdash;the
laughter-loving, irresponsible, light-hearted adventurer&mdash;as
the prey of those fiends who would revel in their triumph, who
would crush him, humiliate him, insult him&mdash;ye gods alive!
even torture him, perhaps&mdash;that they might break the
indomitable spirit that would mock them even on the threshold of
death.</p>

<p>Surely, surely God would never allow such monstrous infamy as
the deliverance of the noble soaring eagle into the hands of those
preying jackals! Marguerite&mdash;though her heart ached beyond
what human nature could endure, though her anguish on her husband's
account was doubled by that which she felt for her
brother&mdash;could not bring herself to give up all hope. Sir
Andrew said it rightly; while there was life there was hope. While
there was life in those vigorous limbs, spirit in that daring mind,
how could puny, rampant beasts gain the better of the immortal
soul? As for Armand&mdash;why, if Percy were free she would have no
cause to fear for Armand.</p>

<p>She sighed a sigh of deep, of passionate regret and longing. If
she could only see her husband; if she could only look for one
second into those laughing, lazy eyes, wherein she alone knew how
to fathom the infinity of passion that lay within their depths; if
she could but once feel his&mdash;ardent kiss on her lips, she
could more easily endure this agonising suspense, and wait
confidently and courageously for the issue.</p>

<p>She turned away from the window, for the night was getting
bitterly cold. From the tower of St. Germain l'Auxerrois the clock
slowly struck eight. Even as the last sound of the historic bell
died away in the distance she heard a timid knocking at the
door.</p>

<p>"Enter!" she called unthinkingly.</p>

<p>She thought it was her landlady, come up with more wood, mayhap,
for the fire, so she did not turn to the door when she heard it
being slowly opened, then closed again, and presently a soft tread
on the threadbare carpet.</p>

<p>"May I crave your kind attention, Lady Blakeney?" said a harsh
voice, subdued to tones of ordinary courtesy.</p>

<p>She quickly repressed a cry of terror. How well she knew that
voice! When last she heard it it was at Boulogne, dictating that
infamous letter&mdash;the weapon wherewith Percy had so effectually
foiled his enemy. She turned and faced the man who was her
bitterest foe&mdash;hers in the person of the man she loved.</p>

<p>"Chauvelin!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Himself at your service, dear lady," he said simply.</p>

<p>He stood in the full light of the lamp, his trim, small figure
boldly cut out against the dark wall beyond. He wore the usual
sable-coloured clothes which he affected, with the primly-folded
jabot and cuffs edged with narrow lace.</p>

<p>Without waiting for permission from her he quietly and
deliberately placed his hat and cloak on a chair. Then he turned
once more toward her, and made a movement as if to advance into the
room; but instinctively she put up a hand as if to ward off the
calamity of his approach.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and the shadow of a smile, that had
neither mirth nor kindliness in it, hovered round the corners of
his thin lips.</p>

<p>"Have I your permission to sit?" he asked.</p>

<p>"As you will," she replied slowly, keeping her wide-open eyes
fixed upon him as does a frightened bird upon the serpent whom it
loathes and fears.</p>

<p>"And may I crave a few moments of your undivided attention, Lady
Blakeney?" he continued, taking a chair, and so placing it beside
the table that the light of the lamp when he sat remained behind
him and his face was left in shadow.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary?" asked Marguerite.</p>

<p>"It is," he replied curtly, "if you desire to see and speak with
your husband&mdash;to be of use to him before it is too late."</p>

<p>"Then, I pray you, speak, citizen, and I will listen."</p>

<p>She sank into a chair, not heeding whether the light of the lamp
fell on her face or not, whether the lines in her haggard cheeks,
or her tear-dimmed eyes showed plainly the sorrow and despair that
had traced them. She had nothing to hide from this man, the cause
of all the tortures which she endured. She knew that neither
courage nor sorrow would move him, and that hatred for
Percy&mdash;personal deadly hatred for the man who had twice foiled
him&mdash;had long crushed the last spark of humanity in his
heart.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Lady Blakeney," he began after a slight pause and in
his smooth, even voice, "it would interest you to hear how I
succeeded in procuring for myself this pleasure of an interview
with you?"</p>

<p>"Your spies did their usual work, I suppose," she said
coldly.</p>

<p>"Exactly. We have been on your track for three days, and
yesterday evening an unguarded movement on the part of Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes gave us the final clue to your whereabouts."</p>

<p>"Of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes?" she asked, greatly puzzled.</p>

<p>"He was in an eating-house, cleverly disguised, I own, trying to
glean information, no doubt as to the probable fate of Sir Percy
Blakeney. As chance would have it, my friend Héron, of the
Committee of General Security, chanced to be discussing with
reprehensible openness&mdash;er&mdash;certain&mdash;what shall I
say?&mdash;certain measures which, at my advice, the Committee of
Public Safety have been forced to adopt with a view to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A truce on your smooth-tongued speeches, citizen Chauvelin,"
she interposed firmly. "Sir Andrew Ffoulkes has told me naught of
this&mdash;so I pray you speak plainly and to the point, if you
can."</p>

<p>He bowed with marked irony.</p>

<p>"As you please," he said. "Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, hearing certain
matters of which I will tell you anon, made a movement which
betrayed him to one of our spies. At a word from citizen Héron this
man followed on the heels of the young farrier who had shown such
interest in the conversation of the Chief Agent. Sir Andrew, I
imagine, burning with indignation at what he had heard, was perhaps
not quite so cautious as he usually is. Anyway, the man on his
track followed him to this door. It was quite simple, as you see.
As for me, I had guessed a week ago that we would see the beautiful
Lady Blakeney in Paris before long. When I knew where Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes lodged, I had no difficulty in guessing that Lady Blakeney
would not be far off."</p>

<p>"And what was there in citizen Héron's conversation last night,"
she asked quietly, "that so aroused Sir Andrew's indignation?"</p>

<p>"He has not told you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh! it is very simple. Let me tell you, Lady Blakeney, exactly
how matters stand. Sir Percy Blakeney&mdash;before lucky chance at
last delivered him into our hands&mdash;thought fit, as no doubt
you know, to meddle with our most important prisoner of State."</p>

<p>"A child. I know it, sir&mdash;the son of a murdered father whom
you and your friends were slowly doing to death."</p>

<p>"That is as it may be, Lady Blakeney," rejoined Chauvelin
calmly; "but it was none of Sir Percy Blakeney's business. This,
however, he chose to disregard. He succeeded in carrying little
Capet from the Temple, and two days later we had him under lock,
and key."</p>

<p>"Through some infamous and treacherous trick, sir," she
retorted.</p>

<p>Chauvelin made no immediate reply; his pale, inscrutable eyes
were fixed upon her face, and the smile of irony round his mouth
appeared more strongly marked than before.</p>

<p>"That, again, is as it may be," he said suavely; "but anyhow for
the moment we have the upper hand. Sir Percy is in the
Conciergerie, guarded day and night, more closely than Marie
Antoinette even was guarded."</p>

<p>"And he laughs at your bolts and bars, sir," she rejoined
proudly. "Remember Calais, remember Boulogne. His laugh at your
discomfiture, then, must resound in your ear even to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes; but for the moment laughter is on our side. Still we are
willing to forego even that pleasure, if Sir Percy will but move a
finger towards his own freedom."</p>

<p>"Again some infamous letter?" she asked with bitter contempt;
"some attempt against his honour?"</p>

<p>"No, no, Lady Blakeney," he interposed with perfect blandness.
"Matters are so much simpler now, you see. We hold Sir Percy at our
mercy. We could send him to the guillotine to-morrow, but we might
be willing&mdash;remember, I only say we might&mdash;to exercise
our prerogative of mercy if Sir Percy Blakeney will on his side
accede to a request from us."</p>

<p>"And that request?"</p>

<p>"Is a very natural one. He took Capet away from us, and it is
but credible that he knows at the present moment exactly where the
child is. Let him instruct his followers&mdash;and I mistake not,
Lady Blakeney, there are several of them not very far from Paris
just now&mdash;let him, I say, instruct these followers of his to
return the person of young Capet to us, and not only will we
undertake to give these same gentlemen a safe conduct back to
England, but we even might be inclined to deal somewhat less
harshly with the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel himself."</p>

<p>She laughed a harsh, mirthless, contemptuous laugh.</p>

<p>"I don't think that I quite understand," she said after a moment
or two, whilst he waited calmly until her out-break of hysterical
mirth had subsided. "You want my husband&mdash;the Scarlet
Pimpernel, citizen&mdash;to deliver the little King of France to
you after he has risked his life to save the child out of your
clutches? Is that what you are trying to say?"</p>

<p>"It is," rejoined Chauvelin complacently, "just what we have
been saying to Sir Percy Blakeney for the past six days,
madame."</p>

<p>"Well! then you have had your answer, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied slowly; "but the answer has become weaker day
by day."</p>

<p>"Weaker? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Let me explain, Lady Blakeney," said Chauvelin, now with
measured emphasis. He put both elbows on the table and leaned well
forward, peering into her face, lest one of its varied expressions
escaped him. "Just now you taunted me with my failure in Calais,
and again at Boulogne, with a proud toss of the head, which I own
is excessive becoming; you threw the name of the Scarlet Pimpernel
in my face like a challenge which I no longer dare to accept. 'The
Scarlet Pimpernel,' you would say to me, 'stands for loyalty, for
honour, and for indomitable courage. Think you he would sacrifice
his honour to obtain your mercy? Remember Boulogne and your
discomfiture!' All of which, dear lady, is perfectly charming and
womanly and enthusiastic, and I, bowing my humble head, must own
that I was fooled in Calais and baffled in Boulogne. But in
Boulogne I made a grave mistake, and one from which I learned a
lesson, which I am putting into practice now."</p>

<p>He paused a while as if waiting for her reply. His pale, keen
eyes had already noted that with every phrase he uttered the lines
in her beautiful face became more hard and set. A look of horror
was gradually spreading over it, as if the icy-cold hand of death
had passed over her eyes and cheeks, leaving them rigid like
stone.</p>

<p>"In Boulogne," resumed Chauvelin quietly, satisfied that his
words were hitting steadily at her heart&mdash;"in Boulogne Sir
Percy and I did not fight an equal fight. Fresh from a pleasant
sojourn in his own magnificent home, full of the spirit of
adventure which puts the essence of life into a man's veins, Sir
Percy Blakeney's splendid physique was pitted against my feeble
powers. Of course I lost the battle. I made the mistake of trying
to subdue a man who was in the zenith of his strength, whereas
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen Chauvelin," she said, "whereas now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir Percy Blakeney has been in the prison of the Conciergerie
for exactly one week, Lady Blakeney," he replied, speaking very
slowly, and letting every one of his words sink individually into
her mind. "Even before he had time to take the bearings of his cell
or to plan on his own behalf one of those remarkable escapes for
which he is so justly famous, our men began to work on a scheme
which I am proud to say originated with myself. A week has gone by
since then, Lady Blakeney, and during that time a special company
of prison guard, acting under the orders of the Committee of
General Security and of Public Safety, have questioned the prisoner
unremittingly&mdash;unremittingly, remember&mdash;day and night.
Two by two these men take it in turns to enter the prisoner's cell
every quarter of an hour&mdash;lately it has had to be more
often&mdash;and ask him the one question, 'Where is little Capet?'
Up to now we have received no satisfactory reply, although we have
explained to Sir Percy that many of his followers are honouring the
neighbourhood of Paris with their visit, and that all we ask for
from him are instructions to those gallant gentlemen to bring young
Capet back to us. It is all very simple, unfortunately the prisoner
is somewhat obstinate. At first, even, the idea seemed to amuse
him; he used to laugh and say that he always had the faculty of
sleeping with his eyes open. But our soldiers are untiring in their
efforts, and the want of sleep as well as of a sufficiency of food
and of fresh air is certainly beginning to tell on Sir Percy
Blakeney's magnificent physique. I don't think that it will be very
long before he gives way to our gentle persuasions; and in any case
now, I assure you, dear lady, that we need not fear any attempt on
his part to escape. I doubt if he could walk very steadily across
this room&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marguerite had sat quite silent and apparently impassive all the
while that Chauvelin had been speaking; even now she scarcely
stirred. Her face expressed absolutely nothing but deep puzzlement.
There was a frown between her brows, and her eyes, which were
always of such liquid blue, now looked almost black. She was trying
to visualise that which Chauvelin had put before her: a man
harassed day and night, unceasingly, unremittingly, with one
question allowed neither respite nor sleep&mdash;his brain, soul,
and body fagged out at every hour, every moment of the day and
night, until mind and body and soul must inevitably give way under
anguish ten thousand times more unendurable than any physical
torment invented by monsters in barbaric times.</p>

<p>That man thus harassed, thus fagged out, thus martyrised at all
hours of the day and night, was her husband, whom she loved with
every fibre of her being, with every throb of her heart.</p>

<p>Torture? Oh, no! these were advanced and civilised times that
could afford to look with horror on the excesses of medieval days.
This was a revolution that made for progress, and challenged the
opinion of the world. The cells of the Temple of La Force or the
Conciergerie held no secret inquisition with iron maidens and racks
and thumbscrews; but a few men had put their tortuous brains
together, and had said one to another: "We want to find out from
that man where we can lay our hands on little Capet, so we won't
let him sleep until he has told us. It is not torture&mdash;oh, no!
Who would dare to say that we torture our prisoners? It is only a
little horseplay, worrying to the prisoner, no doubt; but, after
all, he can end the unpleasantness at any moment. He need but to
answer our question, and he can go to sleep as comfortably as a
little child. The want of sleep is very trying, the want of proper
food and of fresh air is very weakening; the prisoner must give way
sooner or later&mdash;"</p>

<p>So these fiends had decided it between them, and they had put
their idea into execution for one whole week. Marguerite looked at
Chauvelin as she would on some monstrous, inscrutable Sphinx,
marveling if God&mdash;even in His anger&mdash;could really have
created such a fiendish brain, or, having created it, could allow
it to wreak such devilry unpunished.</p>

<p>Even now she felt that he was enjoying the mental anguish which
he had put upon her, and she saw his thin, evil lips curled into a
smile.</p>

<p>"So you came to-night to tell me all this?" she asked as soon as
she could trust herself to speak. Her impulse was to shriek out her
indignation, her horror of him, into his face. She longed to call
down God's eternal curse upon this fiend; but instinctively she
held herself in check. Her indignation, her words of loathing would
only have added to his delight.</p>

<p>"You have had your wish," she added coldly; "now, I pray you,
go."</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Lady Blakeney," he said with all his habitual
blandness; "my object in coming to see you tonight was twofold.
Methought that I was acting as your friend in giving you authentic
news of Sir Percy, and in suggesting the possibility of your adding
your persuasion to ours."</p>

<p>"My persuasion? You mean that I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would wish to see your husband, would you not, Lady
Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I pray you command me. I will grant you the permission
whenever you wish to go."</p>

<p>"You are in the hope, citizen," she said, "that I will do my
best to break my husband's spirit by my tears or my
prayers&mdash;is that it?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," he replied pleasantly. "I assure you that we
can manage to do that ourselves, in time."</p>

<p>"You devil!" The cry of pain and of horror was involuntarily
wrung from the depths of her soul. "Are you not afraid that God's
hand will strike you where you stand?"</p>

<p>"No," he said lightly; "I am not afraid, Lady Blakeney. You see,
I do not happen to believe in God. Come!" he added more seriously,
"have I not proved to you that my offer is disinterested? Yet I
repeat it even now. If you desire to see Sir Percy in prison,
command me, and the doors shall be open to you."</p>

<p>She waited a moment, looking him straight and quite
dispassionately in the face; then she said coldly:</p>

<p>"Very well! I will go."</p>

<p>"When?" he asked.</p>

<p>"This evening."</p>

<p>"Just as you wish. I would have to go and see my friend Héron
first, and arrange with him for your visit."</p>

<p>"Then go. I will follow in half an hour."</p>

<p>"<i>C'est entendu</i>. Will you be at the main entrance of the
Conciergerie at half-past nine? You know it, perhaps&mdash;no? It
is in the Rue de la Barillerie, immediately on the right at the
foot of the great staircase of the house of Justice."</p>

<p>"Of the house of Justice!" she exclaimed involuntarily, a world
of bitter contempt in her cry. Then she added in her former
matter-of-fact tones:</p>

<p>"Very good, citizen. At half-past nine I will be at the entrance
you name."</p>

<p>"And I will be at the door prepared to escort you."</p>

<p>He took up his hat and coat and bowed ceremoniously to her. Then
he turned to go. At the door a cry from her&mdash;involuntarily
enough, God knows!&mdash;made him pause.</p>

<p>"My interview with the prisoner," she said, vainly trying, poor
soul! to repress that quiver of anxiety in her voice, "it will be
private?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Of course," he replied with a reassuring smile. "<i>Au
revoir</i>, Lady Blakeney! Half-past nine, remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could no longer trust herself to look on him as he finally
took his departure. She was afraid&mdash;yes, absolutely afraid
that her fortitude would give way&mdash;meanly, despicably,
uselessly give way; that she would suddenly fling herself at the
feet of that sneering, inhuman wretch, that she would pray,
implore&mdash;Heaven above! what might she not do in the face of
this awful reality, if the last lingering shred of vanishing
reason, of pride, and of courage did not hold her in check?</p>

<p>Therefore she forced herself not to look on that departing,
sable-clad figure, on that evil face, and those hands that held
Percy's fate in their cruel grip; but her ears caught the welcome
sound of his departure&mdash;the opening and shutting of the door,
his light footstep echoing down the stone stairs.</p>

<p>When at last she felt that she was really alone she uttered a
loud cry like a wounded doe, and falling on her knees she buried
her face in her hands in a passionate fit of weeping. Violent sobs
shook her entire frame; it seemed as if an overwhelming anguish was
tearing at her heart&mdash;the physical pain of it was almost
unendurable. And yet even through this paroxysm of tears her mind
clung to one root idea: when she saw Percy she must be brave and
calm, be able to help him if he wanted her, to do his bidding if
there was anything that she could do, or any message that she could
take to the others. Of hope she had none. The last lingering ray of
it had been extinguished by that fiend when he said, "We need not
fear that he will escape. I doubt if he could walk very steadily
across this room now."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27. In The
Conciergerie</h2>

<p>Marguerite, accompanied by Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, walked rapidly
along the quay. It lacked ten minutes to the half hour; the night
was dark and bitterly cold. Snow was still falling in sparse, thin
flakes, and lay like a crisp and glittering mantle over the
parapets of the bridges and the grim towers of the Châtelet
prison.</p>

<p>They walked on silently now. All that they had wanted to say to
one another had been said inside the squalid room of their lodgings
when Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had come home and learned that Chauvelin
had been.</p>

<p>"They are killing him by inches, Sir Andrew," had been the
heartrending cry which burst from Marguerite's oppressed heart as
soon as her hands rested in the kindly ones of her best friend. "Is
there aught that we can do?"</p>

<p>There was, of course, very little that could be done. One or two
fine steel files which Sir Andrew gave her to conceal beneath the
folds of her kerchief; also a tiny dagger with sharp, poisoned
blade, which for a moment she held in her hand hesitating, her eyes
filling with tears, her heart throbbing with unspeakable
sorrow.</p>

<p>Then slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;she raised the small,
death-dealing instrument to her lips, and reverently kissed the
narrow blade.</p>

<p>"If it must be!" she murmured, "God in His mercy will
forgive!"</p>

<p>She sheathed the dagger, and this, too, she hid in the folds of
her gown.</p>

<p>"Can you think of anything else, Sir Andrew, that he might
want?" she asked. "I have money in plenty, in case those
soldiers&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Andrew sighed, and turned away from her so as to hide the
hopelessness which he felt. Since three days now he had been
exhausting every conceivable means of getting at the prison guard
with bribery and corruption. But Chauvelin and his friends had
taken excellent precautions. The prison of the Conciergerie,
situated as it was in the very heart of the labyrinthine and
complicated structure of the Châtelet and the house of Justice, and
isolated from every other group of cells in the building, was
inaccessible save from one narrow doorway which gave on the
guard-room first, and thence on the inner cell beyond. Just as all
attempts to rescue the late unfortunate Queen from that prison had
failed, so now every attempt to reach the imprisoned Scarlet
Pimpernel was equally doomed to bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>The guard-room was filled with soldiers day and night; the
windows of the inner cell, heavily barred, were too small to admit
of the passage of a human body, and they were raised twenty feet
from the corridor below. Sir Andrew had stood in the corridor two
days ago, he had looked on the window behind which he knew that his
friend must be eating out his noble heart in a longing for liberty,
and he had realised then that every effort at help from the outside
was foredoomed to failure.</p>

<p>"Courage, Lady Blakeney," he said to Marguerite, when anon they
had crossed the Pont au Change, and were wending their way slowly
along the Rue de la Barillerie; "remember our proud dictum: the
Scarlet Pimpernel never fails! and also this, that whatever
messages Blakeney gives you for us, whatever he wishes us to do, we
are to a man ready to do it, and to give our lives for our chief.
Courage! Something tells me that a man like Percy is not going to
die at the hands of such vermin as Chauvelin and his friends."</p>

<p>They had reached the great iron gates of the house of Justice.
Marguerite, trying to smile, extended her trembling hand to this
faithful, loyal comrade.</p>

<p>"I'll not be far," he said. "When you come out do not look to
the right or left, but make straight for home; I'll not lose sight
of you for a moment, and as soon as possible will overtake you. God
bless you both."</p>

<p>He pressed his lips on her cold little hand, and watched her
tall, elegant figure as she passed through the great gates until
the veil of falling snow hid her from his gaze. Then with a deep
sigh of bitter anguish and sorrow he turned away and was soon lost
in the gloom.</p>

<p>Marguerite found the gate at the bottom of the monumental stairs
open when she arrived. Chauvelin was standing immediately inside
the building waiting for her.</p>

<p>"We are prepared for your visit, Lady Blakeney," he said, "and
the prisoner knows that you are coming."</p>

<p>He led the way down one of the numerous and interminable
corridors of the building, and she followed briskly, pressing her
hand against her bosom there where the folds of her kerchief hid
the steel files and the precious dagger.</p>

<p>Even in the gloom of these ill-lighted passages she realised
that she was surrounded by guards. There were soldiers everywhere;
two had stood behind the door when first she entered, and had
immediately closed it with a loud clang behind her; and all the way
down the corridors, through the half-light engendered by feebly
flickering lamps, she caught glimpses of the white facings on the
uniforms of the town guard, or occasionally the glint of steel of a
bayonet. Presently Chauvelin paused beside a door, which he had
just reached. His hand was on the latch, for it did not appear to
be locked, and he turned toward Marguerite.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Lady Blakeney," he said in simple, deferential
tones, "that the prison authorities, who at my request are granting
you this interview at such an unusual hour, have made a slight
condition to your visit."</p>

<p>"A condition?" she asked. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"You must forgive me," he said, as if purposely evading her
question, "for I give you my word that I had nothing to do with a
regulation that you might justly feel was derogatory to your
dignity. If you will kindly step in here a wardress in charge will
explain to you what is required."</p>

<p>He pushed open the door, and stood aside ceremoniously in order
to allow her to pass in. She looked on him with deep puzzlement and
a look of dark suspicion in her eyes. But her mind was too much
engrossed with the thought of her meeting with Percy to worry over
any trifle that might&mdash;as her enemy had inferred&mdash;offend
her womanly dignity.</p>

<p>She walked into the room, past Chauvelin, who whispered as she
went by:</p>

<p>"I will wait for you here. And, I pray you, if you have aught to
complain of summon me at once."</p>

<p>Then he closed the door behind her. The room in which Marguerite
now found herself was a small unventilated quadrangle, dimly
lighted by a hanging lamp. A woman in a soiled cotton gown and lank
grey hair brushed away from a parchment-like forehead rose from the
chair in which she had been sitting when Marguerite entered, and
put away some knitting on which she had apparently been
engaged.</p>

<p>"I was to tell you, citizeness," she said the moment the door
had been closed and she was alone with Marguerite, "that the prison
authorities have given orders that I should search you before you
visit the prisoner."</p>

<p>She repeated this phrase mechanically like a child who has been
taught to say a lesson by heart. She was a stoutish middle-aged
woman, with that pasty, flabby skin peculiar to those who live in
want of fresh air; but her small, dark eyes were not unkindly,
although they shifted restlessly from one object to another as if
she were trying to avoid looking the other woman straight in the
face.</p>

<p>"That you should search me!" reiterated Marguerite slowly,
trying to understand.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the woman. "I was to tell you to take off your
clothes, so that I might look them through and through. I have
often had to do this before when visitors have been allowed inside
the prison, so it is no use your trying to deceive me in any way. I
am very sharp at finding out if any one has papers, or files or
ropes concealed in an underpetticoat. Come," she added more
roughly, seeing that Marguerite had remained motionless in the
middle of the room; "the quicker you are about it the sooner you
will be taken to see the prisoner."</p>

<p>These words had their desired effect. The proud Lady Blakeney,
inwardly revolting at the outrage, knew that resistance would be
worse than useless. Chauvelin was the other side of the door. A
call from the woman would bring him to her assistance, and
Marguerite was only longing to hasten the moment when she could be
with her husband.</p>

<p>She took off her kerchief and her gown and calmly submitted to
the woman's rough hands as they wandered with sureness and accuracy
to the various pockets and folds that might conceal prohibited
articles. The woman did her work with peculiar stolidity; she did
not utter a word when she found the tiny steel files and placed
them on a table beside her. In equal silence she laid the little
dagger beside them, and the purse which contained twenty gold
pieces. These she counted in front of Marguerite and then replaced
them in the purse. Her face expressed neither surprise, nor greed
nor pity. She was obviously beyond the reach of bribery&mdash;just
a machine paid by the prison authorities to do this unpleasant
work, and no doubt terrorised into doing it conscientiously.</p>

<p>When she had satisfied herself that Marguerite had nothing
further concealed about her person, she allowed her to put her
dress on once more. She even offered to help her on with it. When
Marguerite was fully dressed she opened the door for her. Chauvelin
was standing in the passage waiting patiently. At sight of
Marguerite, whose pale, set face betrayed nothing of the
indignation which she felt, he turned quick, inquiring eyes on the
woman.</p>

<p>"Two files, a dagger and a purse with twenty louis," said the
latter curtly.</p>

<p>Chauvelin made no comment. He received the information quite
placidly, as if it had no special interest for him. Then he said
quietly:</p>

<p>"This way, citizeness!"</p>

<p>Marguerite followed him, and two minutes later he stood beside a
heavy nail-studded door that had a small square grating let into
one of the panels, and said simply:</p>

<p>"This is it."</p>

<p>Two soldiers of the National Guard were on sentry at the door,
two more were pacing up and down outside it, and had halted when
citizen Chauvelin gave his name and showed his tricolour scarf of
office. From behind the small grating in the door a pair of eyes
peered at the newcomers.</p>

<p>"<i>Qui va là?</i>" came the quick challenge from the guard-room
within.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin of the Committee of Public Safety," was the
prompt reply.</p>

<p>There was the sound of grounding of arms, of the drawing of
bolts and the turning of a key in a complicated lock. The prison
was kept locked from within, and very heavy bars had to be moved
ere the ponderous door slowly swung open on its hinges.</p>

<p>Two steps led up into the guard-room. Marguerite mounted them
with the same feeling of awe and almost of reverence as she would
have mounted the steps of a sacrificial altar.</p>

<p>The guard-room itself was more brilliantly lighted than the
corridor outside. The sudden glare of two or three lamps placed
about the room caused her momentarily to close her eyes that were
aching with many shed and unshed tears. The air was rank and heavy
with the fumes of tobacco, of wine and stale food. A large barred
window gave on the corridor immediately above the door.</p>

<p>When Marguerite felt strong enough to look around her, she saw
that the room was filled with soldiers. Some were sitting, others
standing, others lay on rugs against the wall, apparently asleep.
There was one who appeared to be in command, for with a word he
checked the noise that was going on in the room when she entered,
and then he said curtly:</p>

<p>"This way, citizeness!"</p>

<p>He turned to an opening in the wall on the left, the
stone-lintel of a door, from which the door itself had been
removed; an iron bar ran across the opening, and this the sergeant
now lifted, nodding to Marguerite to go within.</p>

<p>Instinctively she looked round for Chauvelin.</p>

<p>But he was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter 28. The Caged Lion</h2>

<p>Was there some instinct of humanity left in the soldier who
allowed Marguerite through the barrier into the prisoner's cell?
Had the wan face of this beautiful woman stirred within his heart
the last chord of gentleness that was not wholly atrophied by the
constant cruelties, the excesses, the mercilessness which his
service under this fraternising republic constantly demanded of
him?</p>

<p>Perhaps some recollection of former years, when first he served
his King and country, recollection of wife or sister or mother
pleaded within him in favour of this sorely-stricken woman with the
look of unspeakable sorrow in her large blue eyes.</p>

<p>Certain it is that as soon as Marguerite passed the barrier he
put himself on guard against it with his back to the interior of
the cell and to her.</p>

<p>Marguerite had paused on the threshold.</p>

<p>After the glaring light of the guard-room the cell seemed dark,
and at first she could hardly see. The whole length of the long,
narrow cubicle lay to her left, with a slight recess at its further
end, so that from the threshold of the doorway she could not see
into the distant corner. Swift as a lightning flash the remembrance
came back to her of proud Marie Antoinette narrowing her life to
that dark corner where the insolent eyes of the rabble soldiery
could not spy her every movement.</p>

<p>Marguerite stepped further into the room. Gradually by the dim
light of an oil lamp placed upon a table in the recess she began to
distinguish various objects: one or two chairs, another table, and
a small but very comfortable-looking camp bedstead.</p>

<p>Just for a few seconds she only saw these inanimate things, then
she became conscious of Percy's presence.</p>

<p>He sat on a chair, with his left arm half-stretched out upon the
table, his head hidden in the bend of the elbow.</p>

<p>Marguerite did not utter a cry; she did not even tremble. Just
for one brief instant she closed her eyes, so as to gather up all
her courage before she dared to look again. Then with a steady and
noiseless step she came quite close to him. She knelt on the
flagstones at his feet and raised reverently to her lips the hand
that hung nerveless and limp by his side.</p>

<p>He gave a start; a shiver seemed to go right through him; he
half raised his head and murmured in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>"I tell you that I do not know, and if I did&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put her arms round him and pillowed her head upon his
breast. He turned his head slowly toward her, and now his
eyes&mdash;hollowed and rimmed with purple&mdash;looked straight
into hers.</p>

<p>"My beloved," he said, "I knew that you would come." His arms
closed round her. There was nothing of lifelessness or of weariness
in the passion of that embrace; and when she looked up again it
seemed to her as if that first vision which she had had of him with
weary head bent, and wan, haggard face was not reality, only a
dream born of her own anxiety for him, for now the hot, ardent
blood coursed just as swiftly as ever through his veins, as if
life&mdash;strong, tenacious, pulsating life&mdash;throbbed with
unabated vigour in those massive limbs, and behind that square,
clear brow as though the body, but half subdued, had transferred
its vanishing strength to the kind and noble heart that was beating
with the fervour of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Percy," she said gently, "they will only give us a few moments
together. They thought that my tears would break your spirit where
their devilry had failed."</p>

<p>He held her glance with his own, with that close, intent look
which binds soul to soul, and in his deep blue eyes there danced
the restless flames of his own undying mirth:</p>

<p>"La! little woman," he said with enforced lightness, even whilst
his voice quivered with the intensity of passion engendered by her
presence, her nearness, the perfume of her hair, "how little they
know you, eh? Your brave, beautiful, exquisite soul, shining now
through your glorious eyes, would defy the machinations of Satan
himself and his horde. Close your dear eyes, my love. I shall go
mad with joy if I drink their beauty in any longer."</p>

<p>He held her face between his two hands, and indeed it seemed as
if he could not satiate his soul with looking into her eyes. In the
midst of so much sorrow, such misery and such deadly fear, never
had Marguerite felt quite so happy, never had she felt him so
completely her own. The inevitable bodily weakness, which of
necessity had invaded even his splendid physique after a whole
week's privations, had made a severe breach in the invincible
barrier of self-control with which the soul of the inner man was
kept perpetually hidden behind a mask of indifference and of
irresponsibility.</p>

<p>And yet the agony of seeing the lines of sorrow so plainly writ
on the beautiful face of the woman he worshipped must have been the
keenest that the bold adventurer had ever experienced in the whole
course of his reckless life. It was he&mdash;and he alone&mdash;who
was making her suffer; her for whose sake he would gladly have shed
every drop of his blood, endured every torment, every misery and
every humiliation; her whom he worshipped only one degree less than
he worshipped his honour and the cause which he had made his
own.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of that agony, in spite of the heartrending pathos
of her pale wan face, and through the anguish of seeing her tears,
the ruling passion&mdash;strong in death&mdash;the spirit of
adventure, the mad, wild, devil-may-care irresponsibility was never
wholly absent.</p>

<p>"Dear heart," he said with a quaint sigh, whilst he buried his
face in the soft masses of her hair, "until you came I was so
d----d fatigued."</p>

<p>He was laughing, and the old look of boyish love of mischief
illumined his haggard face.</p>

<p>"Is it not lucky, dear heart," he said a moment or two later,
"that those brutes do not leave me unshaved? I could not have faced
you with a week's growth of beard round my chin. By dint of
promises and bribery I have persuaded one of that rabble to come
and shave me every morning. They will not allow me to handle a
razor myself. They are afraid I should cut my throat&mdash;or one
of theirs. But mostly I am too d----d sleepy to think of such a
thing."</p>

<p>"Percy!" she exclaimed with tender and passionate reproach.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know, dear," he murmured, "what a brute I am!
Ah, God did a cruel thing the day that He threw me in your path. To
think that once&mdash;not so very long ago&mdash;we were drifting
apart, you and I. You would have suffered less, dear heart, if we
had continued to drift."</p>

<p>Then as he saw that his bantering tone pained her, he covered
her hands with kisses, entreating her forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Dear heart," he said merrily, "I deserve that you should leave
me to rot in this abominable cage. They haven't got me yet, little
woman, you know; I am not yet dead&mdash;only d----d sleepy at
times. But I'll cheat them even now, never fear."</p>

<p>"How, Percy&mdash;how?" she moaned, for her heart was aching
with intolerable pain; she knew better than he did the precautions
which were being taken against his escape, and she saw more clearly
than he realised it himself the terrible barrier set up against
that escape by ever encroaching physical weakness.</p>

<p>"Well, dear," he said simply, "to tell you the truth I have not
yet thought of that all-important 'how.' I had to wait, you see,
until you came. I was so sure that you would come! I have succeeded
in putting on paper all my instructions for Ffoulkes and the
others. I will give them to you anon. I knew that you would come,
and that I could give them to you; until then I had but to think of
one thing, and that was of keeping body and soul together. My
chance of seeing you was to let them have their will with me. Those
brutes were sure, sooner or later, to bring you to me, that you
might see the caged fox worn down to imbecility, eh? That you might
add your tears to their persuasion, and succeed where they have
failed."</p>

<p>He laughed lightly with an unstrained note of gaiety, only
Marguerite's sensitive ears caught the faint tone of bitterness
which rang through the laugh.</p>

<p>"Once I know that the little King of France is safe," he said,
"I can think of how best to rob those d----d murderers of my
skin."</p>

<p>Then suddenly his manner changed. He still held her with one arm
closely to, him, but the other now lay across the table, and the
slender, emaciated hand was tightly clutched. He did not look at
her, but straight ahead; the eyes, unnaturally large now, with
their deep purple rims, looked far ahead beyond the stone walls of
this grim, cruel prison.</p>

<p>The passionate lover, hungering for his beloved, had vanished;
there sat the man with a purpose, the man whose firm hand had
snatched men and women and children from death, the reckless
enthusiast who tossed his life against an ideal.</p>

<p>For a while he sat thus, while in his drawn and haggard face she
could trace every line formed by his thoughts&mdash;the frown of
anxiety, the resolute setting of the lips, the obstinate look of
will around the firm jaw. Then he turned again to her.</p>

<p>"My beautiful one," he said softly, "the moments are very
precious. God knows I could spend eternity thus with your dear form
nestling against my heart. But those d----d murderers will only
give us half an hour, and I want your help, my beloved, now that I
am a helpless cur caught in their trap. Will you listen
attentively, dear heart, to what I am going to say?</p>

<p>"Yes, Percy, I will listen," she replied.</p>

<p>"And have you the courage to do just what I tell you, dear?"</p>

<p>"I would not have courage to do aught else," she said
simply.</p>

<p>"It means going from hence to-day, dear heart, and perhaps not
meeting again. Hush-sh-sh, my beloved," he said, tenderly placing
his thin hand over her mouth, from which a sharp cry of pain had
well-nigh escaped; "your exquisite soul will be with me always.
Try&mdash;try not to give way to despair. Why! your love alone,
which I see shining from your dear eyes, is enough to make a man
cling to life with all his might. Tell me! will you do as I ask
you?"</p>

<p>And she replied firmly and courageously:</p>

<p>"I will do just what you ask, Percy."</p>

<p>"God bless you for your courage, dear. You will have need of
it."</p>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter 29. For The Sake Of That
Helpless Innocent</h2>

<p>The next instant he was kneeling on the floor and his hands were
wandering over the small, irregular flagstones immediately
underneath the table. Marguerite had risen to her feet; she watched
her husband with intent and puzzled eyes; she saw him suddenly pass
his slender fingers along a crevice between two flagstones, then
raise one of these slightly and from beneath it extract a small
bundle of papers, each carefully folded and sealed. Then he
replaced the stone and once more rose to his knees.</p>

<p>He gave a quick glance toward the doorway. That corner of his
cell, the recess wherein stood the table, was invisible to any one
who had not actually crossed the threshold. Reassured that his
movements could not have been and were not watched, he drew
Marguerite closer to him.</p>

<p>"Dear heart," he whispered, "I want to place these papers in
your care. Look upon them as my last will and testament. I
succeeded in fooling those brutes one day by pretending to be
willing to accede to their will. They gave me pen and ink and paper
and wax, and I was to write out an order to my followers to bring
the Dauphin hither. They left me in peace for one quarter of an
hour, which gave me time to write three letters&mdash;one for
Armand and the other two for Ffoulkes, and to hide them under the
flooring of my cell. You see, dear, I knew that you would come and
that I could give them to you then."</p>

<p>He paused, and that ghost of a smile once more hovered round his
lips. He was thinking of that day when he had fooled Héron and
Chauvelin into the belief that their devilry had succeeded, and
that they had brought the reckless adventurer to his knees. He
smiled at the recollection of their wrath when they knew that they
had been tricked, and after a quarter of an hour's anxious waiting
found a few sheets of paper scribbled over with incoherent words or
satirical verse, and the prisoner having apparently snatched ten
minutes' sleep, which seemingly had restored to him quite a modicum
of his strength.</p>

<p>But of this he told Marguerite nothing, nor of the insults and
the humiliation which he had had to bear in consequence of that
trick. He did not tell her that directly afterwards the order went
forth that the prisoner was to be kept on bread and water in the
future, nor that Chauvelin had stood by laughing and jeering
while...</p>

<p>No! he did not tell her all that; the recollection of it all had
still the power to make him laugh; was it not all a part and parcel
of that great gamble for human lives wherein he had held the
winning cards himself for so long?</p>

<p>"It is your turn now," he had said even then to his bitter
enemy.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Chauvelin had replied, "our turn at last. And you will
not bend my fine English gentleman, we'll break you yet, never
fear."</p>

<p>It was the thought of it all, of that hand to hand, will to
will, spirit to spirit struggle that lighted up his haggard face
even now, gave him a fresh zest for life, a desire to combat and to
conquer in spite of all, in spite of the odds that had martyred his
body but left the mind, the will, the power still unconquered.</p>

<p>He was pressing one of the papers into her hand, holding her
fingers tightly in his, and compelling her gaze with the ardent
excitement of his own.</p>

<p>"This first letter is for Ffoulkes," he said. "It relates to the
final measures for the safety of the Dauphin. They are my
instructions to those members of the League who are in or near
Paris at the present moment. Ffoulkes, I know, must be with
you&mdash;he was not likely, God bless his loyalty, to let you come
to Paris alone. Then give this letter to him, dear heart, at once,
to-night, and tell him that it is my express command that he and
the others shall act in minute accordance with my
instructions."</p>

<p>"But the Dauphin surely is safe now," she urged. "Ffoulkes and
the others are here in order to help you."</p>

<p>"To help me, dear heart?" he interposed earnestly. "God alone
can do that now, and such of my poor wits as these devils do not
succeed in crushing out of me within the next ten days."</p>

<p>Ten days!</p>

<p>"I have waited a week, until this hour when I could place this
packet in your hands; another ten days should see the Dauphin out
of France&mdash;after that, we shall see."</p>

<p>"Percy," she exclaimed in an agony of horror, "you cannot endure
this another day&mdash;and live!"</p>

<p>"Nay!" he said in a tone that was almost insolent in its proud
defiance, "there is but little that a man cannot do an he sets his
mind to it. For the rest, 'tis in God's hands!" he added more
gently. "Dear heart! you swore that you would be brave. The Dauphin
is still in France, and until he is out of it he will not really be
safe; his friends wanted to keep him inside the country. God only
knows what they still hope; had I been free I should not have
allowed him to remain so long; now those good people at Mantes will
yield to my letter and to Ffoulkes' earnest appeal&mdash;they will
allow one of our League to convey the child safely out of France,
and I'll wait here until I know that he is safe. If I tried to get
away now, and succeeded&mdash;why, Heaven help us! the hue and cry
might turn against the child, and he might be captured before I
could get to him. Dear heart! dear, dear heart! try to understand.
The safety of that child is bound with mine honour, but I swear to
you, my sweet love, that the day on which I feel that that safety
is assured I will save mine own skin&mdash;what there is left of
it&mdash;if I can!"</p>

<p>"Percy!" she cried with a sudden outburst of passionate revolt,
"you speak as if the safety of that child were of more moment than
your own. Ten days!&mdash;but, God in Heaven! have you thought how
I shall live these ten days, whilst slowly, inch by inch, you give
your dear, your precious life for a forlorn cause?"</p>

<p>"I am very tough, m'dear," he said lightly; "'tis not a question
of life. I shall only be spending a few more very uncomfortable
days in this d----d hole; but what of that?"</p>

<p>Her eyes spoke the reply; her eyes veiled with tears, that
wandered with heart-breaking anxiety from the hollow circles round
his own to the lines of weariness about the firm lips and jaw. He
laughed at her solicitude.</p>

<p>"I can last out longer than these brutes have any idea of," he
said gaily.</p>

<p>"You cheat yourself, Percy," she rejoined with quiet
earnestness. "Every day that you spend immured between these walls,
with that ceaseless nerve-racking torment of sleeplessness which
these devils have devised for the breaking of your will&mdash;every
day thus spent diminishes your power of ultimately saving yourself.
You see, I speak calmly&mdash;dispassionately&mdash;I do not even
urge my claims upon your life. But what you must weigh in the
balance is the claim of all those for whom in the past you have
already staked your life, whose lives you have purchased by risking
your own. What, in comparison with your noble life, is that of the
puny descendant of a line of decadent kings? Why should it be
sacrificed&mdash;ruthlessly, hopelessly sacrificed that a boy might
live who is as nothing to the world, to his country&mdash;even to
his own people?"</p>

<p>She had tried to speak calmly, never raising her voice beyond a
whisper. Her hands still clutched that paper, which seemed to sear
her fingers, the paper which she felt held writ upon its smooth
surface the death-sentence of the man she loved.</p>

<p>But his look did not answer her firm appeal; it was fixed far
away beyond the prison walls, on a lonely country road outside
Paris, with the rain falling in a thin drizzle, and leaden clouds
overhead chasing one another, driven by the gale.</p>

<p>"Poor mite," he murmured softly; "he walked so bravely by my
side, until the little feet grew weary; then he nestled in my arms
and slept until we met Ffoulkes waiting with the cart. He was no
King of France just then, only a helpless innocent whom Heaven
aided me to save."</p>

<p>Marguerite bowed her head in silence. There was nothing more
that she could say, no plea that she could urge. Indeed, she had
understood, as he had begged her to understand. She understood that
long ago he had mapped out the course of his life, and now that
that course happened to lead up a Calvary of humiliation and of
suffering he was not likely to turn back, even though, on the
summit, death already was waiting and beckoning with no uncertain
hand; not until he could murmur, in the wake of the great and
divine sacrifice itself, the sublime words:</p>

<p>"It is accomplished."</p>

<p>"But the Dauphin is safe enough now," was all that she said,
after that one moment's silence when her heart, too, had offered up
to God the supreme abnegation of self, and calmly faced a sorrow
which threatened to break it at last.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he rejoined quietly, "safe enough for the moment. But he
would be safer still if he were out of France. I had hoped to take
him one day with me to England. But in this plan damnable Fate has
interfered. His adherents wanted to get him to Vienna, and their
wish had best be fulfilled now. In my instructions to Ffoulkes I
have mapped out a simple way for accomplishing the journey. Tony
will be the one best suited to lead the expedition, and I want him
to make straight for Holland; the Northern frontiers are not so
closely watched as are the Austrian ones. There is a faithful
adherent of the Bourbon cause who lives at Delft, and who will give
the shelter of his name and home to the fugitive King of France
until he can be conveyed to Vienna. He is named Nauudorff. Once I
feel that the child is safe in his hands I will look after myself,
never fear."</p>

<p>He paused, for his strength, which was only factitious, born of
the excitement that Marguerite's presence had called forth, was
threatening to give way. His voice, though he had spoken in a
whisper all along, was very hoarse, and his temples were throbbing
with the sustained effort to speak.</p>

<p>"If those fiends had only thought of denying me food instead of
sleep," he murmured involuntarily, "I could have held out
until&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then with characteristic swiftness his mood changed in a moment.
His arms closed round Marguerite once more with a passion of
self-reproach.</p>

<p>"Heaven forgive me for a selfish brute," he said, whilst the
ghost of a smile once more lit up the whole of his face. "Dear
soul, I must have forgotten your sweet presence, thus brooding over
my own troubles, whilst your loving heart has a graver
burden&mdash;God help me!&mdash;than it can possibly bear. Listen,
my beloved, for I don't know how many minutes longer they intend to
give us, and I have not yet spoken to you about Armand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Armand!" she cried.</p>

<p>A twinge of remorse had gripped her. For fully ten minutes now
she had relegated all thoughts of her brother to a distant cell of
her memory.</p>

<p>"We have no news of Armand," she said. "Sir Andrew has searched
all the prison registers. Oh! were not my heart atrophied by all
that it has endured this past sennight it would feel a final throb
of agonising pain at every thought of Armand."</p>

<p>A curious look, which even her loving eyes failed to interpret,
passed like a shadow over her husband's face. But the shadow lifted
in a moment, and it was with a reassuring smile that he said to
her:</p>

<p>"Dear heart! Armand is comparatively safe for the moment. Tell
Ffoulkes not to search the prison registers for him, rather to seek
out Mademoiselle Lange. She will know where to find Armand."</p>

<p>"Jeanne Lange!" she exclaimed with a world of bitterness in the
tone of her voice, "the girl whom Armand loved, it seems, with a
passion greater than his loyalty. Oh! Sir Andrew tried to disguise
my brother's folly, but I guessed what he did not choose to tell
me. It was his disobedience, his want of trust, that brought this
unspeakable misery on us all."</p>

<p>"Do not blame him overmuch, dear heart. Armand was in love, and
love excuses every sin committed in its name. Jeanne Lange was
arrested and Armand lost his reason temporarily. The very day on
which I rescued the Dauphin from the Temple I had the good fortune
to drag the little lady out of prison. I had given my promise to
Armand that she should be safe, and I kept my word. But this Armand
did not know&mdash;or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself abruptly, and once more that strange,
enigmatical look crept into his eyes.</p>

<p>"I took Jeanne Lange to a place of comparative safety," he said
after a slight pause, "but since then she has been set entirely
free."</p>

<p>"Free?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Chauvelin himself brought me the news," he replied with a
quick, mirthless laugh, wholly unlike his usual light-hearted
gaiety. "He had to ask me where to find Jeanne, for I alone knew
where she was. As for Armand, they'll not worry about him whilst I
am here. Another reason why I must bide a while longer. But in the
meanwhile, dear, I pray you find Mademoiselle Lange; she lives at
No. 5 Square du Roule. Through her I know that you can get to see
Armand. This second letter," he added, pressing a smaller packet
into her hand, "is for him. Give it to him, dear heart; it will, I
hope, tend to cheer him. I fear me the poor lad frets; yet he only
sinned because he loved, and to me he will always be your
brother&mdash;the man who held your affection for all the years
before I came into your life. Give him this letter, dear; they are
my instructions to him, as the others are for Ffoulkes; but tell
him to read them when he is all alone. You will do that, dear
heart, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Percy," she said simply. "I promise."</p>

<p>Great joy, and the expression of intense relief, lit up his
face, whilst his eyes spoke the gratitude which he felt.</p>

<p>"Then there is one thing more," he said. "There are others in
this cruel city, dear heart, who have trusted me, and whom I must
not fail&mdash;Marie de Marmontel and her brother, faithful
servants of the late queen; they were on the eve of arrest when I
succeeded in getting them to a place of comparative safety; and
there are others there, too all of these poor victims have trusted
me implicitly. They are waiting for me there, trusting in my
promise to convey them safely to England. Sweetheart, you must
redeem my promise to them. You will?&mdash;you will? Promise me
that you will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I promise, Percy," she said once more.</p>

<p>"Then go, dear, to-morrow, in the late afternoon, to No. 98, Rue
de Charonne. It is a narrow house at the extreme end of that long
street which abuts on the fortifications. The lower part of the
house is occupied by a dealer in rags and old clothes. He and his
wife and family are wretchedly poor, but they are kind, good souls,
and for a consideration and a minimum of risk to themselves they
will always render service to the English milor's, whom they
believe to be a band of inveterate smugglers. Ffoulkes and all the
others know these people and know the house; Armand by the same
token knows it too. Marie de Marmontel and her brother are there,
and several others; the old Comte de Lézardière, the Abbé de
Firmont; their names spell suffering, loyalty, and hopelessness. I
was lucky enough to convey them safely to that hidden shelter. They
trust me implicitly, dear heart. They are waiting for me there,
trusting in my promise to them. Dear heart, you will go, will you
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Percy," she replied. "I will go; I have promised."</p>

<p>"Ffoulkes has some certificates of safety by him, and the old
clothes dealer will supply the necessary disguises; he has a
covered cart which he uses for his business, and which you can
borrow from him. Ffoulkes will drive the little party to Achard's
farm in St. Germain, where other members of the League should be in
waiting for the final journey to England. Ffoulkes will know how to
arrange for everything; he was always my most able lieutenant. Once
everything is organised he can appoint Hastings to lead the party.
But you, dear heart, must do as you wish. Achard's farm would be a
safe retreat for you and for Ffoulkes: if...I know&mdash;I know,
dear," he added with infinite tenderness. "See I do not even
suggest that you should leave me. Ffoulkes will be with you, and I
know that neither he nor you would go even if I commanded. Either
Achard's farm, or even the house in the Rue de Charonne, would be
quite safe for you, dear, under Ffoulkes's protection, until the
time when I myself can carry you back&mdash;you, my precious
burden&mdash;to England in mine own arms, or until...Hush-sh-sh,
dear heart," he entreated, smothering with a passionate kiss the
low moan of pain which had escaped her lips; "it is all in God's
hands now; I am in a tight corner&mdash;tighter than ever I have
been before; but I am not dead yet, and those brutes have not yet
paid the full price for my life. Tell me, dear heart, that you have
understood&mdash;that you will do all that I asked. Tell me again,
my dear, dear love; it is the very essence of life to hear your
sweet lips murmur this promise now."</p>

<p>And for the third time she reiterated firmly:</p>

<p>"I have understood every word that you said to me, Percy, and I
promise on your precious life to do what you ask."</p>

<p>He sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction, and even at that moment
there came from the guard-room beyond the sound of a harsh voice,
saying peremptorily:</p>

<p>"That half-hour is nearly over, sergeant; 'tis time you
interfered."</p>

<p>"Three minutes more, citizen," was the curt reply.</p>

<p>"Three minutes, you devils," murmured Blakeney between set
teeth, whilst a sudden light which even Marguerite's keen gaze
failed to interpret leapt into his eyes. Then he pressed the third
letter into her hand.</p>

<p>Once more his close, intent gaze compelled hers; their faces
were close one to the other, so near to him did he draw her, so
tightly did he hold her to him. The paper was in her hand and his
fingers were pressed firmly on hers.</p>

<p>"Put this in your kerchief, my beloved," he whispered. "Let it
rest on your exquisite bosom where I so love to pillow my head.
Keep it there until the last hour when it seems to you that nothing
more can come between me and shame...Hush-sh-sh, dear," he added
with passionate tenderness, checking the hot protest that at the
word "shame" had sprung to her lips, "I cannot explain more fully
now. I do not know what may happen. I am only a man, and who knows
what subtle devilry those brutes might not devise for bringing the
untamed adventurer to his knees. For the next ten days the Dauphin
will be on the high roads of France, on his way to safety. Every
stage of his journey will be known to me. I can from between these
four walls follow him and his escort step by step. Well, dear, I am
but a man, already brought to shameful weakness by mere physical
discomfort&mdash;the want of sleep&mdash;such a trifle after all;
but in case my reason tottered&mdash;God knows what I might
do&mdash;then give this packet to Ffoulkes&mdash;it contains my
final instructions&mdash;and he will know how to act. Promise me,
dear heart, that you will not open the packet unless&mdash;unless
mine own dishonour seems to you imminent&mdash;unless I have
yielded to these brutes in this prison, and sent Ffoulkes or one of
the others orders to exchange the Dauphin's life for mine; then,
when mine own handwriting hath proclaimed me a coward, then and
then only, give this packet to Ffoulkes. Promise me that, and also
that when you and he have mastered its contents you will act
exactly as I have commanded. Promise me that, dear, in your own
sweet name, which may God bless, and in that of Ffoulkes, our loyal
friend."</p>

<p>Through the sobs that well-nigh choked her she murmured the
promise he desired.</p>

<p>His voice had grown hoarser and more spent with the inevitable
reaction after the long and sustained effort, but the vigour of the
spirit was untouched, the fervour, the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Dear heart," he murmured, "do not look on me with those dear,
scared eyes of yours. If there is aught that puzzles you in what I
said, try and trust me a while longer. Remember, I must save the
Dauphin at all costs; mine honour is bound with his safety. What
happens to me after that matters but little, yet I wish to live for
your dear sake."</p>

<p>He drew a long breath which had naught of weariness in it. The
haggard look had completely vanished from his face, the eyes were
lighted up from within, the very soul of reckless daring and
immortal gaiety illumined his whole personality.</p>

<p>"Do not look so sad, little woman," he said with a strange and
sudden recrudescence of power; "those d----d murderers have not got
me yet&mdash;even now."</p>

<p>Then he went down like a log.</p>

<p>The effort had been too prolonged&mdash;weakened nature
reasserted her rights and he lost consciousness. Marguerite,
helpless and almost distraught with grief, had yet the strength of
mind not to call for assistance. She pillowed the loved one's head
upon her breast, she kissed the dear, tired eyes, the poor
throbbing temples. The unutterable pathos of seeing this man, who
was always the personification of extreme vitality, energy, and
boundless endurance and pluck, lying thus helpless, like a tired
child, in her arms, was perhaps the saddest moment of this day of
sorrow. But in her trust she never wavered for one instant. Much
that he had said had puzzled her; but the word "shame" coming from
his own lips as a comment on himself never caused her the slightest
pang of fear. She had quickly hidden the tiny packet in her
kerchief. She would act point by point exactly as he had ordered
her to do, and she knew that Ffoulkes would never waver either.</p>

<p>Her heart ached well-nigh to breaking point. That which she
could not understand had increased her anguish tenfold. If she
could only have given way to tears she could have borne this final
agony more easily. But the solace of tears was not for her; when
those loved eyes once more opened to consciousness they should see
hers glowing with courage and determination.</p>

<p>There had been silence for a few minutes in the little cell. The
soldiery outside, inured to their hideous duty, thought no doubt
that the time had come for them to interfere. The iron bar was
raised and thrown back with a loud crash, the butt-ends of muskets
were grounded against the floor, and two soldiers made noisy
irruption into the cell.</p>

<p>"<i>Holà</i>, citizen! Wake up," shouted one of the men; "you
have not told us yet what you have done with Capet!"</p>

<p>Marguerite uttered a cry of horror. Instinctively her arms were
interposed between the unconscious man and these inhuman creatures,
with a beautiful gesture of protecting motherhood.</p>

<p>"He has fainted," she said, her voice quivering with
indignation. "My God! are you devils that you have not one spark of
manhood in you?"</p>

<p>The men shrugged their shoulders, and both laughed brutally.
They had seen worse sights than these, since they served a Republic
that ruled by bloodshed and by terror. They were own brothers in
callousness and cruelty to those men who on this self-same spot a
few months ago had watched the daily agony of a martyred Queen, or
to those who had rushed into the Abbaye prison on that awful day in
September, and at a word from their infamous leaders had put eighty
defenceless prisoners&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;to the
sword.</p>

<p>"Tell him to say what he has done with Capet," said one of the
soldiers now, and this rough command was accompanied with a coarse
jest that sent the blood flaring up into Marguerite's pale
cheeks.</p>

<p>The brutal laugh, the coarse words which accompanied it, the
insult flung at Marguerite, had penetrated to Blakeney's slowly
returning consciousness. With sudden strength, that appeared almost
supernatural, he jumped to his feet, and before any of the others
could interfere he had with clenched fist struck the soldier a full
blow on the mouth.</p>

<p>The man staggered back with a curse, the other shouted for help;
in a moment the narrow place swarmed with soldiers; Marguerite was
roughly torn away from the prisoner's side, and thrust into the far
corner of the cell, from where she only saw a confused mass of blue
coats and white belts, and&mdash;towering for one brief moment
above what seemed to her fevered fancy like a veritable sea of
heads&mdash;the pale face of her husband, with wide dilated eyes
searching the gloom for hers.</p>

<p>"Remember!" he shouted, and his voice for that brief moment rang
out clear and sharp above the din.</p>

<p>Then he disappeared behind the wall of glistening bayonets, of
blue coats and uplifted arms; mercifully for her she remembered
nothing more very clearly. She felt herself being dragged out of
the cell, the iron bar being thrust down behind her with a loud
clang. Then in a vague, dreamy state of semi-unconsciousness she
saw the heavy bolts being drawn back from the outer door, heard the
grating of the key in the monumental lock, and the next moment a
breath of fresh air brought the sensation of renewed life into
her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter 30. Afterwards</h2>

<p>"I am sorry, Lady Blakeney," said a harsh, dry voice close to
her; "the incident at the end of your visit was none of our making,
remember."</p>

<p>She turned away, sickened with horror at thought of contact with
this wretch. She had heard the heavy oaken door swing to behind her
on its ponderous hinges, and the key once again turn in the lock.
She felt as if she had suddenly been thrust into a coffin, and that
clods of earth were being thrown upon her breast, oppressing her
heart so that she could not breathe.</p>

<p>Had she looked for the last time on the man whom she loved
beyond everything else on earth, whom she worshipped more ardently
day by day? Was she even now carrying within the folds of her
kerchief a message from a dying man to his comrades?</p>

<p>Mechanically she followed Chauvelin down the corridor and along
the passages which she had traversed a brief half-hour ago. From
some distant church tower a clock tolled the hour of ten. It had
then really only been little more than thirty brief minutes since
first she had entered this grim building, which seemed less stony
than the monsters who held authority within it; to her it seemed
that centuries had gone over her head during that time. She felt
like an old woman, unable to straighten her back or to steady her
limbs; she could only dimly see some few paces ahead the trim
figure of Chauvelin walking with measured steps, his hands held
behind his back, his head thrown up with what looked like
triumphant defiance.</p>

<p>At the door of the cubicle where she had been forced to submit
to the indignity of being searched by a wardress, the latter was
now standing, waiting with characteristic stolidity. In her hand
she held the steel files, the dagger and the purse which, as
Marguerite passed, she held out to her.</p>

<p>"Your property, citizeness," she said placidly.</p>

<p>She emptied the purse into her own hand, and solemnly counted
out the twenty pieces of gold. She was about to replace them all
into the purse, when Marguerite pressed one of them back into her
wrinkled hand.</p>

<p>"Nineteen will be enough, citizeness," she said; "keep one for
yourself, not only for me, but for all the poor women who come here
with their heart full of hope, and go hence with it full of
despair."</p>

<p>The woman turned calm, lack-lustre eyes on her, and silently
pocketed the gold piece with a grudgingly muttered word of
thanks.</p>

<p>Chauvelin during this brief interlude, had walked thoughtlessly
on ahead. Marguerite, peering down the length of the narrow
corridor, spied his sable-clad figure some hundred mètres further
on as it crossed the dim circle of light thrown by one of the
lamps.</p>

<p>She was about to follow, when it seemed to her as if some one
was moving in the darkness close beside her. The wardress was even
now in the act of closing the door of her cubicle, and there were a
couple of soldiers who were disappearing from view round one end of
the passage, whilst Chauvelin's retreating form was lost in the
gloom at the other.</p>

<p>There was no light close to where she herself was standing, and
the blackness around her was as impenetrable as a veil; the sound
of a human creature moving and breathing close to her in this
intense darkness acted weirdly on her overwrought nerves.</p>

<p>"<i>Qui va là?</i>" she called.</p>

<p>There was a more distinct movement among the shadows this time,
as of a swift tread on the flagstones of the corridor. All else was
silent round, and now she could plainly hear those footsteps
running rapidly down the passage away from her. She strained her
eyes to see more clearly, and anon in one of the dim circles of
light on ahead she spied a man's figure&mdash;slender and darkly
clad&mdash;walking quickly yet furtively like one pursued. As he
crossed the light the man turned to look back. It was her brother
Armand.</p>

<p>Her first instinct was to call to him; the second checked that
call upon her lips.</p>

<p>Percy had said that Armand was in no danger; then why should he
be sneaking along the dark corridors of this awful house of Justice
if he was free and safe?</p>

<p>Certainly, even at a distance, her brother's movements suggested
to Marguerite that he was in danger of being seen. He cowered in
the darkness, tried to avoid the circles of light thrown by the
lamps in the passage. At all costs Marguerite felt that she must
warn him that the way he was going now would lead him straight into
Chauvelin's arms, and she longed to let him know that she was close
by.</p>

<p>Feeling sure that he would recognise her voice, she made
pretence to turn back to the cubicle through the door of which the
wardress had already disappeared, and called out as loudly as she
dared:</p>

<p>"Good-night, citizeness!"</p>

<p>But Armand&mdash;who surely must have heard&mdash;did not pause
at the sound. Rather was he walking on now more rapidly than
before. In less than a minute he would be reaching the spot where
Chauvelin stood waiting for Marguerite. That end of the corridor,
however, received no light from any of the lamps; strive how she
might, Marguerite could see nothing now either of Chauvelin or of
Armand.</p>

<p>Blindly, instinctively, she ran forward, thinking only to reach
Armand, and to warn him to turn back before it was too late; before
he found himself face to face with the most bitter enemy he and his
nearest and dearest had ever had. But as she at last came to a halt
at the end of the corridor, panting with the exertion of running
and the fear for Armand, she almost fell up against Chauvelin, who
was standing there alone and imperturbable, seemingly having waited
patiently for her. She could only dimly distinguish his face, the
sharp features and thin cruel mouth, but she felt&mdash;more than
she actually saw&mdash;his cold steely eyes fixed with a strange
expression of mockery upon her.</p>

<p>But of Armand there was no sign, and she&mdash;poor
soul!&mdash;had difficulty in not betraying the anxiety which she
felt for her brother. Had the flagstones swallowed him up? A door
on the right was the only one that gave on the corridor at this
point; it led to the concierge's lodge, and thence out into the
courtyard. Had Chauvelin been dreaming, sleeping with his eyes
open, whilst he stood waiting for her, and had Armand succeeded in
slipping past him under cover of the darkness and through that door
to safety that lay beyond these prison walls?</p>

<p>Marguerite, miserably agitated, not knowing what to think,
looked somewhat wild-eyed on Chauvelin; he smiled, that
inscrutable, mirthless smile of his, and said blandly:</p>

<p>"Is there aught else that I can do for you, citizeness? This is
your nearest way out. No doubt Sir Andrew will be waiting to escort
you home."</p>

<p>Then as she&mdash;not daring either to reply or to
question&mdash;walked straight up to the door, he hurried forward,
prepared to open it for her. But before he did so he turned to her
once again:</p>

<p>"I trust that your visit has pleased you, Lady Blakeney," he
said suavely. "At what hour do you desire to repeat it
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" she reiterated in a vague, absent manner, for she
was still dazed with the strange incident of Armand's appearance
and his flight.</p>

<p>"Yes. You would like to see Sir Percy again to-morrow, would you
not? I myself would gladly pay him a visit from time to time, but
he does not care for my company. My colleague, citizen Héron, on
the other hand, calls on him four times in every twenty-four hours;
he does so a few moments before the changing of the guard, and
stays chatting with Sir Percy until after the guard is changed,
when he inspects the men and satisfies himself that no traitor has
crept in among them. All the men are personally known to him, you
see. These hours are at five in the morning and again at eleven,
and then again at five and eleven in the evening. My friend Héron,
as you see, is zealous and assiduous, and, strangely enough, Sir
Percy does not seem to view his visit with any displeasure. Now at
any other hour of the day, Lady Blakeney, I pray you command me and
I will arrange that citizen Héron grant you a second interview with
the prisoner."</p>

<p>Marguerite had only listened to Chauvelin's lengthy speech with
half an ear; her thoughts still dwelt on the past half-hour with
its bitter joy and its agonising pain; and fighting through her
thoughts of Percy there was the recollection of Armand which so
disquieted her. But though she had only vaguely listened to what
Chauvelin was saying, she caught the drift of it.</p>

<p>Madly she longed to accept his suggestion. The very thought of
seeing Percy on the morrow was solace to her aching heart; it could
feed on hope to-night instead of on its own bitter pain. But even
during this brief moment of hesitancy, and while her whole being
cried out for this joy that her enemy was holding out to her, even
then in the gloom ahead of her she seemed to see a vision of a pale
face raised above a crowd of swaying heads, and of the eyes of the
dreamer searching for her own, whilst the last sublime cry of
perfect self-devotion once more echoed in her ear:</p>

<p>"Remember!"</p>

<p>The promise which she had given him, that would she fulfil. The
burden which he had laid on her shoulders she would try to bear as
heroically as he was bearing his own. Aye, even at the cost of the
supreme sorrow of never resting again in the haven of his arms.</p>

<p>But in spite of sorrow, in spite of anguish so terrible that she
could not imagine Death itself to have a more cruel sting, she
wished above all to safeguard that final, attenuated thread of hope
which was wound round the packet that lay hidden on her breast.</p>

<p>She wanted, above all, not to arouse Chauvelin's suspicions by
markedly refusing to visit the prisoner again&mdash;suspicions that
might lead to her being searched once more and the precious packet
filched from her. Therefore she said to him earnestly now:</p>

<p>"I thank you, citizen, for your solicitude on my behalf, but you
will understand, I think, that my visit to the prisoner has been
almost more than I could bear. I cannot tell you at this moment
whether to-morrow I should be in a fit state to repeat it."</p>

<p>"As you please," he replied urbanely. "But I pray you to
remember one thing, and that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused a moment while his restless eyes wandered rapidly over
her face, trying, as it were, to get at the soul of this woman, at
her innermost thoughts, which he felt were hidden from him.</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen," she said quietly; "what is it that I am to
remember?"</p>

<p>"That it rests with you, Lady Blakeney, to put an end to the
present situation."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Surely you can persuade Sir Percy's friends not to leave their
chief in durance vile. They themselves could put an end to his
troubles to-morrow."</p>

<p>"By giving up the Dauphin to you, you mean?" she retorted
coldly.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"And you hoped&mdash;you still hope that by placing before me
the picture of your own fiendish cruelty against my husband you
will induce me to act the part of a traitor towards him and a
coward before his followers?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said deprecatingly, "the cruelty now is no longer mine.
Sir Percy's release is in your hands, Lady Blakeney&mdash;in that
of his followers. I should only be too willing to end the present
intolerable situation. You and your friends are applying the last
turn of the thumbscrew, not I&mdash;"</p>

<p>She smothered the cry of horror that had risen to her lips. The
man's cold-blooded sophistry was threatening to make a breach in
her armour of self-control.</p>

<p>She would no longer trust herself to speak, but made a quick
movement towards the door.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders as if the matter were now entirely out
of his control. Then he opened the door for her to pass out, and as
her skirts brushed against him he bowed with studied deference,
murmuring a cordial "Good-night!"</p>

<p>"And remember, Lady Blakeney," he added politely, "that should
you at any time desire to communicate with me at my rooms, 19, Rue
Dupuy, I hold myself entirely at your service."</p>

<p>Then as her tall, graceful figure disappeared in the outside
gloom he passed his thin hand over his mouth as if to wipe away the
last lingering signs of triumphant irony:</p>

<p>"The second visit will work wonders, I think, my fine lady," he
murmured under his breath.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter 31. An Interlude</h2>

<p>It was close on midnight now, and still they sat opposite one
another, he the friend and she the wife, talking over that brief
half-hour that had meant an eternity to her.</p>

<p>Marguerite had tried to tell Sir Andrew everything; bitter as it
was to put into actual words the pathos and misery which she had
witnessed, yet she would hide nothing from the devoted comrade whom
she knew Percy would trust absolutely. To him she repeated every
word that Percy had uttered, described every inflection of his
voice, those enigmatical phrases which she had not understood, and
together they cheated one another into the belief that hope
lingered somewhere hidden in those words.</p>

<p>"I am not going to despair, Lady Blakeney," said Sir Andrew
firmly; "and, moreover, we are not going to disobey. I would stake
my life that even now Blakeney has some scheme in his mind which is
embodied in the various letters which he has given you, and
which&mdash;Heaven help us in that case!&mdash;we might thwart by
disobedience. Tomorrow in the late afternoon I will escort you to
the Rue de Charonne. It is a house that we all know well, and which
Armand, of course, knows too. I had already inquired there two days
ago to ascertain whether by chance St. Just was not in hiding
there, but Lucas, the landlord and old-clothes dealer, knew nothing
about him."</p>

<p>Marguerite told him about her swift vision of Armand in the dark
corridor of the house of Justice.</p>

<p>"Can you understand it, Sir Andrew?" she asked, fixing her deep,
luminous eyes inquiringly upon him.</p>

<p>"No, I cannot," he said, after an almost imperceptible moment of
hesitancy; "but we shall see him to-morrow. I have no doubt that
Mademoiselle Lange will know where to find him; and now that we
know where she is, all our anxiety about him, at any rate, should
soon be at an end."</p>

<p>He rose and made some allusion to the lateness of the hour.
Somehow it seemed to her that her devoted friend was trying to hide
his innermost thoughts from her. She watched him with an anxious,
intent gaze.</p>

<p>"Can you understand it all, Sir Andrew?" she reiterated with a
pathetic note of appeal.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said firmly. "On my soul, Lady Blakeney, I know no
more of Armand than you do yourself. But I am sure that Percy is
right. The boy frets because remorse must have assailed him by now.
Had he but obeyed implicitly that day, as we all did&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he could not frame the whole terrible proposition in words.
Bitterly as he himself felt on the subject of Armand, he would not
add yet another burden to this devoted woman's heavy load of
misery.</p>

<p>"It was Fate, Lady Blakeney," he said after a while. "Fate! a
damnable fate which did it all. Great God! to think of Blakeney in
the hands of those brutes seems so horrible that at times I feel as
if the whole thing were a nightmare, and that the next moment we
shall both wake hearing his merry voice echoing through this
room."</p>

<p>He tried to cheer her with words of hope that he knew were but
chimeras. A heavy weight of despondency lay on his heart. The
letter from his chief was hidden against his breast; he would study
it anon in the privacy of his own apartment so as to commit every
word to memory that related to the measures for the ultimate safety
of the child-King. After that it would have to be destroyed, lest
it fell into inimical hands.</p>

<p>Soon he bade Marguerite good-night. She was tired out, body and
soul, and he&mdash;her faithful friend&mdash;vaguely wondered how
long she would be able to withstand the strain of so much sorrow,
such unspeakable misery.</p>

<p>When at last she was alone Marguerite made brave efforts to
compose her nerves so as to obtain a certain modicum of sleep this
night. But, strive how she might, sleep would not come. How could
it, when before her wearied brain there rose constantly that awful
vision of Percy in the long, narrow cell, with weary head bent over
his arm, and those fiends shouting persistently in his ear:</p>

<p>"Wake up, citizen! Tell us, where is Capet?"</p>

<p>The fear obsessed her that his mind might give way; for the
mental agony of such intense weariness must be well-nigh impossible
to bear. In the dark, as she sat hour after hour at the open
window, looking out in the direction where through the veil of snow
the grey walls of the Châtelet prison towered silent and grim, she
seemed to see his pale, drawn face with almost appalling reality;
she could see every line of it, and could study it with the
intensity born of a terrible fear.</p>

<p>How long would the ghostly glimmer of merriment still linger in
the eyes? When would the hoarse, mirthless laugh rise to the lips,
that awful laugh that proclaims madness? Oh! she could have
screamed now with the awfulness of this haunting terror. Ghouls
seemed to be mocking her out of the darkness, every flake of snow
that fell silently on the window-sill became a grinning face that
taunted and derided; every cry in the silence of the night, every
footstep on the quay below turned to hideous jeers hurled at her by
tormenting fiends.</p>

<p>She closed the window quickly, for she feared that she would go
mad. For an hour after that she walked up and down the room making
violent efforts to control her nerves, to find a glimmer of that
courage which she promised Percy that she would have.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter 32. Sisters</h2>

<p>The morning found her fagged out, but more calm. Later on she
managed to drink some coffee, and having washed and dressed, she
prepared to go out.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew appeared in time to ascertain her wishes.</p>

<p>"I promised Percy to go to the Rue de Charonne in the late
afternoon," she said. "I have some hours to spare, and mean to
employ them in trying to find speech with Mademoiselle Lange."</p>

<p>"Blakeney has told you where she lives?"</p>

<p>"Yes. In the Square du Roule. I know it well. I can be there in
half an hour."</p>

<p>He, of course, begged to be allowed to accompany her, and anon
they were walking together quickly up toward the Faubourg St.
Honoré. The snow had ceased falling, but it was still very cold,
but neither Marguerite nor Sir Andrew were conscious of the
temperature or of any outward signs around them. They walked on
silently until they reached the torn-down gates of the Square du
Roule; there Sir Andrew parted from Marguerite after having
appointed to meet her an hour later at a small eating-house he knew
of where they could have some food together, before starting on
their long expedition to the Rue de Charonne.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Marguerite Blakeney was shown in by worthy
Madame Belhomme, into the quaint and pretty drawing-room with its
soft-toned hangings and old-world air of faded grace. Mademoiselle
Lange was sitting there, in a capacious armchair, which encircled
her delicate figure with its frame-work of dull old gold.</p>

<p>She was ostensibly reading when Marguerite was announced, for an
open book lay on a table beside her; but it seemed to the visitor
that mayhap the young girl's thoughts had played truant from her
work, for her pose was listless and apathetic, and there was a look
of grave trouble upon the childlike face.</p>

<p>She rose when Marguerite entered, obviously puzzled at the
unexpected visit, and somewhat awed at the appearance of this
beautiful woman with the sad look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I must crave your pardon, mademoiselle," said Lady Blakeney as
soon as the door had once more closed on Madame Belhomme, and she
found herself alone with the young girl. "This visit at such an
early hour must seem to you an intrusion. But I am Marguerite St.
Just, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her smile and outstretched hand completed the sentence.</p>

<p>"St. Just!" exclaimed Jeanne.</p>

<p>"Yes. Armand's sister!"</p>

<p>A swift blush rushed to the girl's pale cheeks; her brown eyes
expressed unadulterated joy. Marguerite, who was studying her
closely, was conscious that her poor aching heart went out to this
exquisite child, the far-off innocent cause of so much misery.</p>

<p>Jeanne, a little shy, a little confused and nervous in her
movements, was pulling a chair close to the fire, begging
Marguerite to sit. Her words came out all the while in short jerky
sentences, and from time to time she stole swift shy glances at
Armand's sister.</p>

<p>"You will forgive me, mademoiselle," said Marguerite, whose
simple and calm manner quickly tended to soothe Jeanne Lange's
confusion; "but I was so anxious about my brother&mdash;I do not
know where to find him."</p>

<p>"And so you came to me, madame?"</p>

<p>"Was I wrong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! But what made you think that&mdash;that I would
know?"</p>

<p>"I guessed," said Marguerite with a smile. "You had heard about
me then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"Through whom? Did Armand tell you about me?"</p>

<p>"No, alas! I have not seen him this past fortnight, since you,
mademoiselle, came into his life; but many of Armand's friends are
in Paris just now; one of them knew, and he told me."</p>

<p>The soft blush had now overspread the whole of the girl's face,
even down to her graceful neck. She waited to see Marguerite
comfortably installed in an armchair, then she resumed shyly:</p>

<p>"And it was Armand who told me all about you. He loves you so
dearly."</p>

<p>"Armand and I were very young children when we lost our
parents," said Marguerite softly, "and we were all in all to each
other then. And until I married he was the man I loved best in all
the world."</p>

<p>"He told me you were married&mdash;to an Englishman."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"He loves England too. At first he always talked of my going
there with him as his wife, and of the happiness we should find
there together."</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'at first'?"</p>

<p>"He talks less about England now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he feels that now you know all about it, and that you
understand each other with regard to the future."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>Jeanne sat opposite to Marguerite on a low stool by the fire.
Her elbows were resting on her knees, and her face just now was
half-hidden by the wealth of her brown curls. She looked
exquisitely pretty sitting like this, with just the suggestion of
sadness in the listless pose. Marguerite had come here to-day
prepared to hate this young girl, who in a few brief days had
stolen not only Armand's heart, but his allegiance to his chief,
and his trust in him. Since last night, when she had seen her
brother sneak silently past her like a thief in the night, she had
nurtured thoughts of ill-will and anger against Jeanne.</p>

<p>But hatred and anger had melted at the sight of this child.
Marguerite, with the perfect understanding born of love itself, had
soon realised the charm which a woman like Mademoiselle Lange must
of necessity exercise over a chivalrous, enthusiastic nature like
Armand's. The sense of protection&mdash;the strongest perhaps that
exists in a good man's heart&mdash;would draw him irresistibly to
this beautiful child, with the great, appealing eyes, and the look
of pathos that pervaded the entire face. Marguerite, looking in
silence on the dainty picture before her, found it in her heart to
forgive Armand for disobeying his chief when those eyes beckoned to
him in a contrary direction.</p>

<p>How could he, how could any chivalrous man endure the thought of
this delicate, fresh flower lying crushed and drooping in the hands
of monsters who respected neither courage nor purity? And Armand
had been more than human, or mayhap less, if he had indeed
consented to leave the fate of the girl whom he had sworn to love
and protect in other hands than his own.</p>

<p>It seemed almost as if Jeanne was conscious of the fixity of
Marguerite's gaze, for though she did not turn to look at her, the
flush gradually deepened in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Lange," said Marguerite gently, "do you not feel
that you can trust me?"</p>

<p>She held out her two hands to the girl, and Jeanne slowly turned
to her. The next moment she was kneeling at Marguerite's feet, and
kissing the beautiful kind hands that had been stretched out to her
with such sisterly love.</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed, I do trust you," she said, and looked with
tear-dimmed eyes in the pale face above her. "I have longed for
some one in whom I could confide. I have been so lonely lately, and
Armand&mdash;"</p>

<p>With an impatient little gesture she brushed away the tears
which had gathered in her eyes.</p>

<p>"What has Armand been doing?" asked Marguerite with an
encouraging smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing to grieve me!" replied the young girl eagerly, "for
he is kind and good, and chivalrous and noble. Oh, I love him with
all my heart! I loved him from the moment that I set eyes on him,
and then he came to see me&mdash;perhaps you know! And he talked so
beautiful about England, and so nobly about his leader the Scarlet
Pimpernel&mdash;have you heard of him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marguerite, smiling. "I have heard of him."</p>

<p>"It was that day that citizen Héron came with his soldiers! Oh!
you do not know citizen Héron. He is the most cruel man in France.
In Paris he is hated by every one, and no one is safe from his
spies. He came to arrest Armand, but I was able to fool him and to
save Armand. And after that," she added with charming naivete, "I
felt as if, having saved Armand's life, he belonged to me&mdash;and
his love for me had made me his."</p>

<p>"Then I was arrested," she continued after a slight pause, and
at the recollection of what she had endured then her fresh voice
still trembled with horror.</p>

<p>"They dragged me to prison, and I spent two days in a dark cell,
where&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands, whilst a few sobs shook her whole
frame; then she resumed more calmly:</p>

<p>"I had seen nothing of Armand. I wondered where he was, and I
knew that he would be eating out his heart with anxiety for me. But
God was watching over me. At first I was transferred to the Temple
prison, and there a kind creature&mdash;a sort of man-of-all work
in the prison took compassion on me. I do not know how he contrived
it, but one morning very early he brought me some filthy old rags
which he told me to put on quickly, and when I had done that he
bade me follow him. Oh! he was a very dirty, wretched man himself,
but he must have had a kind heart. He took me by the hand and made
me carry his broom and brushes. Nobody took much notice of us, the
dawn was only just breaking, and the passages were very dark and
deserted; only once some soldiers began to chaff him about me:
'<i>C'est ma fille&mdash;quoi?</i>' he said roughly. I very nearly
laughed then, only I had the good sense to restrain myself, for I
knew that my freedom, and perhaps my life, depended on my not
betraying myself. My grimy, tattered guide took me with him right
through the interminable corridors of that awful building, whilst I
prayed fervently to God for him and for myself. We got out by one
of the service stairs and exit, and then he dragged me through some
narrow streets until we came to a corner where a covered cart stood
waiting. My kind friend told me to get into the cart, and then he
bade the driver on the box take me straight to a house in the Rue
St. Germain l'Auxerrois. Oh! I was infinitely grateful to the poor
creature who had helped me to get out of that awful prison, and I
would gladly have given him some money, for I am sure he was very
poor; but I had none by me. He told me that I should be quite safe
in the house in the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois, and begged me to
wait there patiently for a few days until I heard from one who had
my welfare at heart, and who would further arrange for my
safety."</p>

<p>Marguerite had listened silently to this narrative so naïvely
told by this child, who obviously had no idea to whom she owed her
freedom and her life. While the girl talked, her mind could follow
with unspeakable pride and happiness every phase of that scene in
the early dawn, when that mysterious, ragged man-of-all-work,
unbeknown even to the woman whom he was saving, risked his own
noble life for the sake of her whom his friend and comrade
loved.</p>

<p>"And did you never see again the kind man to whom you owe your
life?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No!" replied Jeanne. "I never saw him since; but when I arrived
at the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois I was told by the good people
who took charge of me that the ragged man-of-all-work had been none
other than the mysterious Englishman whom Armand reveres, he whom
they call the Scarlet Pimpernel."</p>

<p>"But you did not stay very long in the Rue St. Germain
l'Auxerrois, did you?"</p>

<p>"No. Only three days. The third day I received a
<i>communiqué</i> from the Committee of General Security, together
with an unconditional certificate of safety. It meant that I was
free&mdash;quite free. Oh! I could scarcely believe it. I laughed
and I cried until the people in the house thought that I had gone
mad. The past few days had been such a horrible nightmare."</p>

<p>"And then you saw Armand again?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They told him that I was free. And he came here to see me.
He often comes; he will be here anon."</p>

<p>"But are you not afraid on his account and your own? He
is&mdash;he must be still&mdash;'suspect'; a well-known adherent of
the Scarlet Pimpernel, he would be safer out of Paris."</p>

<p>"No! oh, no! Armand is in no danger. He, too, has an
unconditional certificate of safety."</p>

<p>"An unconditional certificate of safety?" asked Marguerite,
whilst a deep frown of grave puzzlement appeared between her brows.
"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that he is free to come and go as he likes; that
neither he nor I have anything to fear from Héron and his awful
spies. Oh! but for that sad and careworn look on Armand's face we
could be so happy; but he is so unlike himself. He is Armand and
yet another; his look at times quite frightens me."</p>

<p>"Yet you know why he is so sad," said Marguerite in a strange,
toneless voice which she seemed quite unable to control, for that
tonelessness came from a terrible sense of suffocation, of a
feeling as if her heart-strings were being gripped by huge, hard
hands.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Jeanne half hesitatingly, as if knowing, she
was still unconvinced.</p>

<p>"His chief, his comrade, the friend of whom you speak, the
Scarlet Pimpernel, who risked his life in order to save yours,
mademoiselle, is a prisoner in the hands of those that hate
him."</p>

<p>Marguerite had spoken with sudden vehemence. There was almost an
appeal in her voice now, as if she were trying not to convince
Jeanne only, but also herself, of something that was quite simple,
quite straightforward, and yet which appeared to be receding from
her, an intangible something, a spirit that was gradually yielding
to a force as yet unborn, to a phantom that had not yet emerged
from out chaos.</p>

<p>But Jeanne seemed unconscious of all this. Her mind was absorbed
in Armand, the man whom she loved in her simple, whole-hearted way,
and who had seemed so different of late.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she said with a deep, sad sigh, whilst the ever-ready
tears once more gathered in her eyes, "Armand is very unhappy
because of him. The Scarlet Pimpernel was his friend; Armand loved
and revered him. Did you know," added the girl, turning large,
horror-filled eyes on Marguerite, "that they want some information
from him about the Dauphin, and to force him to give it
they&mdash;they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Marguerite.</p>

<p>"Can you wonder, then, that Armand is unhappy. Oh! last night,
after he went from me, I cried for hours, just because he had
looked so sad. He no longer talks of happy England, of the cottage
we were to have, and of the Kentish orchards in May. He has not
ceased to love me, for at times his love seems so great that I
tremble with a delicious sense of fear. But oh! his love for me no
longer makes him happy."</p>

<p>Her head had gradually sunk lower and lower on her breast, her
voice died down in a murmur broken by heartrending sighs. Every
generous impulse in Marguerite's noble nature prompted her to take
that sorrowing child in her arms, to comfort her if she could, to
reassure her if she had the power. But a strange icy feeling had
gradually invaded her heart, even whilst she listened to the simple
unsophisticated talk of Jeanne Lange. Her hands felt numb and
clammy, and instinctively she withdrew away from the near vicinity
of the girl. She felt as if the room, the furniture in it, even the
window before her were dancing a wild and curious dance, and that
from everywhere around strange whistling sounds reached her ears,
which caused her head to whirl and her brain to reel.</p>

<p>Jeanne had buried her head in her hands. She was
crying&mdash;softly, almost humbly at first, as if half ashamed of
her grief; then, suddenly it seemed, as if she could not contain
herself any longer, a heavy sob escaped her throat and shook her
whole delicate frame with its violence. Sorrow no longer would be
gainsaid, it insisted on physical expression&mdash;that awful
tearing of the heart-strings which leaves the body numb and panting
with pain.</p>

<p>In a moment Marguerite had forgotten; the dark and shapeless
phantom that had knocked at the gate of her soul was relegated back
into chaos. It ceased to be, it was made to shrivel and to burn in
the great seething cauldron of womanly sympathy. What part this
child had played in the vast cataclysm of misery which had dragged
a noble-hearted enthusiast into the dark torture-chamber, whence
the only outlet led to the guillotine, she&mdash;Marguerite
Blakeney&mdash;did not know; what part Armand, her brother, had
played in it, that she would not dare to guess; all that she knew
was that here was a loving heart that was filled with pain&mdash;a
young, inexperienced soul that was having its first tussle with the
grim realities of life&mdash;and every motherly instinct in
Marguerite was aroused.</p>

<p>She rose and gently drew the young girl up from her knees, and
then closer to her; she pillowed the grief-stricken head against
her shoulder, and murmured gentle, comforting words into the tiny
ear.</p>

<p>"I have news for Armand," she whispered, "that will comfort him,
a message&mdash;a letter from his friend. You will see, dear, that
when Armand reads it he will become a changed man; you see, Armand
acted a little foolishly a few days ago. His chief had given him
orders which he disregarded&mdash;he was so anxious about
you&mdash;he should have obeyed; and now, mayhap, he feels that his
disobedience may have been the&mdash;the innocent cause of much
misery to others; that is, no doubt, the reason why he is so sad.
The letter from his friend will cheer him, you will see."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so, madame?" murmured Jeanne, in whose
tear-stained eyes the indomitable hopefulness of youth was already
striving to shine.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," assented Marguerite.</p>

<p>And for the moment she was absolutely sincere. The phantom had
entirely vanished. She would even, had he dared to re-appear, have
mocked and derided him for his futile attempt at turning the sorrow
in her heart to a veritable hell of bitterness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter 33. Little Mother</h2>

<p>The two women, both so young still, but each of them with a mark
of sorrow already indelibly graven in her heart, were clinging to
one another, bound together by the strong bond of sympathy. And but
for the sadness of it all it were difficult to conjure up a more
beautiful picture than that which they presented as they stood side
by side; Marguerite, tall and stately as an exquisite lily, with
the crown of her ardent hair and the glory of her deep blue eyes,
and Jeanne Lange, dainty and delicate, with the brown curls and the
child-like droop of the soft, moist lips.</p>

<p>Thus Armand saw them when, a moment or two later, he entered
unannounced. He had pushed open the door and looked on the two
women silently for a second or two; on the girl whom he loved so
dearly, for whose sake he had committed the great, the unpardonable
sin which would send him forever henceforth, Cain-like, a wanderer
on the face of the earth; and the other, his sister, her whom a
Judas act would condemn to lonely sorrow and widowhood.</p>

<p>He could have cried out in an agony of remorse, and it was the
groan of acute soul anguish which escaped his lips that drew
Marguerite's attention to his presence.</p>

<p>Even though many things that Jeanne Lange had said had prepared
her for a change in her brother, she was immeasurably shocked by
his appearance. He had always been slim and rather below the
average in height, but now his usually upright and trim figure
seemed to have shrunken within itself; his clothes hung baggy on
his shoulders, his hands appeared waxen and emaciated, but the
greatest change was in his face, in the wide circles round the
eyes, that spoke of wakeful nights, in the hollow cheeks, and the
mouth that had wholly forgotten how to smile.</p>

<p>Percy after a week's misery immured in a dark and miserable
prison, deprived of food and rest, did not look such a physical
wreck as did Armand St. Just, who was free.</p>

<p>Marguerite's heart reproached her for what she felt had been
neglect, callousness on her part. Mutely, within herself, she
craved his forgiveness for the appearance of that phantom which
should never have come forth from out that chaotic hell which had
engendered it.</p>

<p>"Armand!" she cried.</p>

<p>And the loving arms that had guided his baby footsteps long ago,
the tender hands that had wiped his boyish tears, were stretched
out with unalterable love toward him.</p>

<p>"I have a message for you, dear," she said gently&mdash;"a
letter from him. Mademoiselle Jeanne allowed me to wait here for
you until you came."</p>

<p>Silently, like a little shy mouse, Jeanne had slipped out of the
room. Her pure love for Armand had ennobled every one of her
thoughts, and her innate kindliness and refinement had already
suggested that brother and sister would wish to be alone. At the
door she had turned and met Armand's look. That look had satisfied
her; she felt that in it she had read the expression of his love,
and to it she had responded with a glance that spoke of hope for a
future meeting.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed on Jeanne Lange, Armand, with an
impulse that refused to be checked, threw himself into his sister's
arms. The present, with all its sorrows, its remorse and its shame,
had sunk away; only the past remained&mdash;the unforgettable past,
when Marguerite was "little mother"&mdash;the soother, the
comforter, the healer, the ever-willing receptacle wherein he had
been wont to pour the burden of his childish griefs, of his boyish
escapades.</p>

<p>Conscious that she could not know everything&mdash;not yet, at
any rate&mdash;he gave himself over to the rapture of this pure
embrace, the last time, mayhap, that those fond arms would close
round him in unmixed tenderness, the last time that those fond lips
would murmur words of affection and of comfort.</p>

<p>To-morrow those same lips would, perhaps, curse the traitor, and
the small hand be raised in wrath, pointing an avenging finger on
the Judas.</p>

<p>"Little mother," he whispered, babbling like a child, "it is
good to see you again."</p>

<p>"And I have brought you a message from Percy," she said, "a
letter which he begged me to give you as soon as may be."</p>

<p>"You have seen him?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded silently, unable to speak. Not now, not when her
nerves were strung to breaking pitch, would she trust herself to
speak of that awful yesterday. She groped in the folds of her gown
and took the packet which Percy had given her for Armand. It felt
quite bulky in her hand.</p>

<p>"There is quite a good deal there for you to read, dear," she
said. "Percy begged me to give you this, and then to let you read
it when you were alone."</p>

<p>She pressed the packet into his hand. Armand's face was ashen
pale. He clung to her with strange, nervous tenacity; the paper
which he held in one hand seemed to sear his fingers as with a
branding-iron.</p>

<p>"I will slip away now," she said, for strangely enough since
Percy's message had been in Armand's hands she was once again
conscious of that awful feeling of iciness round her heart, a sense
of numbness that paralysed her very thoughts.</p>

<p>"You will make my excuses to Mademoiselle Lange," she said,
trying to smile. "When you have read, you will wish to see her
alone."</p>

<p>Gently she disengaged herself from Armand's grasp and made for
the door. He appeared dazed, staring down at that paper which was
scorching his fingers. Only when her hand was on the latch did he
seem to realise that she was going.</p>

<p>"Little mother," came involuntarily to his lips.</p>

<p>She came straight back to him and took both his wrists in her
small hands. She was taller than he, and his head was slightly bent
forward. Thus she towered over him, loving but strong, her great,
earnest eyes searching his soul.</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again, little mother?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Read your letter, dear," she replied, "and when you have read
it, if you care to impart its contents to me, come to-night to my
lodgings, Quai de la Ferraille, above the saddler's shop. But if
there is aught in it that you do not wish me to know, then do not
come; I shall understand. Good-bye, dear."</p>

<p>She took his head between her two cold hands, and as it was
still bowed she placed a tender kiss, as of a long farewell, upon
his hair.</p>

<p>Then she went out of the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter 34. The Letter</h2>

<p>Armand sat in the armchair in front of the fire. His head rested
against one hand; in the other he held the letter written by the
friend whom he had betrayed.</p>

<p>Twice he had read it now, and already was every word of that
minute, clear writing graven upon the innermost fibres of his body,
upon the most secret cells of his brain.</p>

<p class="newspaper">Armand, I know. I knew even before Chauvelin
came to me, and stood there hoping to gloat over the soul-agony a
man who finds that he has been betrayed by his dearest friend. But
that d----d reprobate did not get that satisfaction, for I was
prepared. Not only do I know, Armand, but I <i>understand</i>. I,
who do not know what love is, have realised how small a thing is
honour, loyalty, or friendship when weighed in the balance of a
loved one's need.<br>
<br>
To save Jeanne you sold me to Héron and his crowd. We are men,
Armand, and the word forgiveness has only been spoken once these
past two thousand years, and then it was spoken by Divine lips. But
Marguerite loves you, and mayhap soon you will be all that is left
her to love on this earth. Because of this she must never know...As
for you, Armand&mdash;well, God help you! But meseems that the hell
which you are enduring now is ten thousand times worse than mine. I
have heard your furtive footsteps in the corridor outside the
grated window of this cell, and would not then have exchanged my
hell for yours. Therefore, Armand, and because Marguerite loves
you, I would wish to turn to you in the hour that I need help. I am
in a tight corner, but the hour may come when a comrade's hand
might mean life to me. I have thought of you, Armand partly because
having taken more than my life, your own belongs to me, and partly
because the plan which I have in my mind will carry with it grave
risks for the man who stands by me.<br>
<br>
I swore once that never would I risk a comrade's life to save mine
own; but matters are so different now...we are both in hell,
Armand, and I in striving to get out of mine will be showing you a
way out of yours.<br>
<br>
Will you retake possession of your lodgings in the Rue de la Croix
Blanche? I should always know then where to find you in an
emergency. But if at any time you receive another letter from me,
be its contents what they may, act in accordance with the letter,
and send a copy of it at once to Ffoulkes or to Marguerite. Keep in
close touch with them both. Tell her I so far forgave your
disobedience (there was nothing more) that I may yet trust my life
and mine honour in your hands.<br>
<br>
I shall have no means of ascertaining definitely whether you will
do all that I ask; but somehow, Armand, I know that you will.</p>

<p>For the third time Armand read the letter through.</p>

<p>"But, Armand," he repeated, murmuring the words softly under his
breath, "I know that you will."</p>

<p>Prompted by some indefinable instinct, moved by a force that
compelled, he allowed himself to glide from the chair on to the
floor, on to his knees.</p>

<p>All the pent-up bitterness, the humiliation, the shame of the
past few days, surged up from his heart to his lips in one great
cry of pain.</p>

<p>"My God!" he whispered, "give me the chance of giving my life
for him."</p>

<p>Alone and unwatched, he gave himself over for a few moments to
the almost voluptuous delight of giving free rein to his grief. The
hot Latin blood in him, tempestuous in all its passions, was firing
his heart and brain now with the glow of devotion and of
self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>The calm, self-centred Anglo-Saxon temperament&mdash;the almost
fatalistic acceptance of failure without reproach yet without
despair, which Percy's letter to him had evidenced in so marked a
manner&mdash;was, mayhap, somewhat beyond the comprehension of this
young enthusiast, with pure Gallic blood in his veins, who was ever
wont to allow his most elemental passions to sway his actions. But
though he did not altogether understand, Armand St. Just could
fully appreciate. All that was noble and loyal in him rose
triumphant from beneath the devastating ashes of his own shame.</p>

<p>Soon his mood calmed down, his look grew less wan and haggard.
Hearing Jeanne's discreet and mouselike steps in the next room, he
rose quickly and hid the letter in the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>She came in and inquired anxiously about Marguerite; a hurriedly
expressed excuse from him, however, satisfied her easily enough.
She wanted to be alone with Armand, happy to see that he held his
head more erect to-day, and that the look as of a hunted creature
had entirely gone from his eyes.</p>

<p>She ascribed this happy change to Marguerite, finding it in her
heart to be grateful to the sister for having accomplished what the
fiancée had failed to do.</p>

<p>For awhile they remained together, sitting side by side,
speaking at times, but mostly silent, seeming to savour the return
of truant happiness. Armand felt like a sick man who has obtained a
sudden surcease from pain. He looked round him with a kind of
melancholy delight on this room which he had entered for the first
time less than a fortnight ago, and which already was so full of
memories.</p>

<p>Those first hours spent at the feet of Jeanne Lange, how
exquisite they had been, how fleeting in the perfection of their
happiness! Now they seemed to belong to a far distant past,
evanescent like the perfume of violets, swift in their flight like
the winged steps of youth. Blakeney's letter had effectually taken
the bitter sting from out his remorse, but it had increased his
already over-heavy load of inconsolable sorrow.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Later in the day he turned his footsteps in the direction of the
river, to the house in the Quai de la Ferraille above the saddler's
shop. Marguerite had returned alone from the expedition to the Rue
de Charonne. Whilst Sir Andrew took charge of the little party of
fugitives and escorted them out of Paris, she came back to her
lodgings in order to collect her belongings, preparatory to taking
up her quarters in the house of Lucas, the old-clothes dealer. She
returned also because she hoped to see Armand.</p>

<p>"If you care to impart the contents of the letter to me, come to
my lodgings to-night," she had said.</p>

<p>All day a phantom had haunted her, the phantom of an agonising
suspicion.</p>

<p>But now the phantom had vanished never to return. Armand was
sitting close beside her, and he told her that the chief had
selected him amongst all the others to stand by him inside the
walls of Paris until the last.</p>

<p>"I shall mayhap," thus closed that precious document, "have no
means of ascertaining definitely whether you will act in accordance
with this letter. But somehow, Armand, I know that you will."</p>

<p>"I know that you will, Armand," reiterated Marguerite
fervently.</p>

<p>She had only been too eager to be convinced; the dread and dark
suspicion which had been like a hideous poisoned sting had only
vaguely touched her soul; it had not gone in very deeply. How could
it, when in its death-dealing passage it encountered the rampart of
tender, almost motherly love?</p>

<p>Armand, trying to read his sister's thoughts in the depths of
her blue eyes, found the look in them limpid and clear. Percy's
message to Armand had reassured her just as he had intended that it
should do. Fate had dealt over harshly with her as it was, and
Blakeney's remorse for the sorrow which he had already caused her,
was scarcely less keen than Armand's. He did not wish her to bear
the intolerable burden of hatred against her brother; and by
binding St. Just close to him at the supreme hour of danger he
hoped to prove to the woman whom he loved so passionately that
Armand was worthy of trust.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Part 3</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>Chapter 35. The Last Phase</h2>

<p>"Well? How is it now?"</p>

<p>"The last phase, I think."</p>

<p>"He will yield?"</p>

<p>"He must."</p>

<p>"Bah! you have said it yourself often enough; those English are
tough."</p>

<p>"It takes time to hack them to pieces, perhaps. In this case
even you, citizen Chauvelin, said that it would take time. Well, it
has taken just seventeen days, and now the end is in sight."</p>

<p>It was close on midnight in the guard-room which gave on the
innermost cell of the Conciergerie. Héron had just visited the
prisoner as was his wont at this hour of the night. He had watched
the changing of the guard, inspected the night-watch, questioned
the sergeant in charge, and finally he had been on the point of
retiring to his own new quarters in the house of Justice, in the
near vicinity of the Conciergerie, when citizen Chauvelin entered
the guard-room unexpectedly and detained his colleague with the
peremptory question:</p>

<p>"How is it now?"</p>

<p>"If you are so near the end, citizen Héron," he now said,
sinking his voice to a whisper, "why not make a final effort and
end it to-night?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could; the anxiety is wearing me out more'n him," he
added with a jerky movement of the head in direction of the inner
cell.</p>

<p>"Shall I try?" rejoined Chauvelin grimly.</p>

<p>"Yes, an you wish."</p>

<p>Citizen Héron's long limbs were sprawling on a guard-room chair.
In this low narrow room he looked like some giant whose body had
been carelessly and loosely put together by a 'prentice hand in the
art of manufacture. His broad shoulders were bent, probably under
the weight of anxiety to which he had referred, and his head, with
the lank, shaggy hair overshadowing the brow, was sunk deep down on
his chest.</p>

<p>Chauvelin looked on his friend and associate with no small
measure of contempt. He would no doubt have preferred to conclude
the present difficult transaction entirely in his own way and
alone; but equally there was no doubt that the Committee of Public
Safety did not trust him quite so fully as it used to do before the
<i>fiasco</i> at Calais and the blunders of Boulogne. Héron, on the
other hand, enjoyed to its outermost the confidence of his
colleagues; his ferocious cruelty and his callousness were well
known, whilst physically, owing to his great height and bulky if
loosely knit frame, he had a decided advantage over his trim and
slender friend.</p>

<p>As far as the bringing of prisoners to trial was concerned, the
chief agent of the Committee of General Security had been given a
perfectly free hand by the decree of the 27th Nivôse. At first,
therefore, he had experienced no difficulty when he desired to keep
the Englishman in close confinement for a time without hurrying on
that summary trial and condemnation which the populace had loudly
demanded, and to which they felt that they were entitled to as a
public holiday. The death of the Scarlet Pimpernel on the
guillotine had been a spectacle promised by every demagogue who
desired to purchase a few votes by holding out visions of pleasant
doings to come; and during the first few days the mob of Paris was
content to enjoy the delights of expectation.</p>

<p>But now seventeen days had gone by and still the Englishman was
not being brought to trial. The pleasure-loving public was waxing
impatient, and earlier this evening, when citizen Héron had shown
himself in the stalls of the national theatre, he was greeted by a
crowded audience with decided expressions of disapproval and open
mutterings of:</p>

<p>"What of the Scarlet Pimpernel?"</p>

<p>It almost looked as if he would have to bring that accursed
Englishman to the guillotine without having wrested from him the
secret which he would have given a fortune to possess. Chauvelin,
who had also been present at the theatre, had heard the expressions
of discontent; hence his visit to his colleague at this late hour
of the night.</p>

<p>"Shall I try?" he had queried with some impatience, and a deep
sigh of satisfaction escaped his thin lips when the chief agent,
wearied and discouraged, had reluctantly agreed.</p>

<p>"Let the men make as much noise as they like," he added with an
enigmatical smile. "The Englishman and I will want an accompaniment
to our pleasant conversation."</p>

<p>Héron growled a surly assent, and without another word Chauvelin
turned towards the inner cell. As he stepped in he allowed the iron
bar to fall into its socket behind him. Then he went farther into
the room until the distant recess was fully revealed to him. His
tread had been furtive and almost noiseless. Now he paused, for he
had caught sight of the prisoner. For a moment he stood quite
still, with hands clasped behind his back in his wonted
attitude&mdash;still save for a strange, involuntary twitching of
his mouth, and the nervous clasping and interlocking of his fingers
behind his back. He was savouring to its utmost fulsomeness the
supremest joy which animal man can ever know&mdash;the joy of
looking on a fallen enemy.</p>

<p>Blakeney sat at the table with one arm resting on it, the
emaciated hand tightly clutched, the body leaning forward, the eyes
looking into nothingness.</p>

<p>For the moment he was unconscious of Chauvelin's presence, and
the latter could gaze on him to the full content of his heart.</p>

<p>Indeed, to all outward appearances there sat a man whom
privations of every sort and kind, the want of fresh air, of proper
food, above all, of rest, had worn down physically to a shadow.
There was not a particle of colour in cheeks or lips, the skin was
grey in hue, the eyes looked like deep caverns, wherein the glow of
fever was all that was left of life.</p>

<p>Chauvelin looked on in silence, vaguely stirred by something
that he could not define, something that right through his
triumphant satisfaction, his hatred and final certainty of revenge,
had roused in him a sense almost of admiration.</p>

<p>He gazed on the noiseless figure of the man who had endured so
much for an ideal, and as he gazed it seemed to him as if the
spirit no longer dwelt in the body, but hovered round in the dank,
stuffy air of the narrow cell above the head of the lonely
prisoner, crowning it with glory that was no longer of this
earth.</p>

<p>Of this the looker-on was conscious despite himself, of that and
of the fact that stare as he might, and with perception rendered
doubly keen by hate, he could not, in spite of all, find the least
trace of mental weakness in that far-seeing gaze which seemed to
pierce the prison walls, nor could he see that bodily weakness had
tended to subdue the ruling passions.</p>

<p>Sir Percy Blakeney&mdash;a prisoner since seventeen days in
close, solitary confinement, half-starved, deprived of rest, and of
that mental and physical activity which had been the very essence
of life to him hitherto&mdash;might be outwardly but a shadow of
his former brilliant self, but nevertheless he was still that same
elegant English gentleman, that prince of dandies whom Chauvelin
had first met eighteen months ago at the most courtly Court in
Europe. His clothes, despite constant wear and the want of
attention from a scrupulous valet, still betrayed the perfection of
London tailoring; he had put them on with meticulous care, they
were free from the slightest particle of dust, and the filmy folds
of priceless Mechlin still half-veiled the delicate whiteness of
his shapely hands.</p>

<p>And in the pale, haggard face, in the whole pose of body and of
arm, there was still the expression of that indomitable strength of
will, that reckless daring, that almost insolent challenge to Fate;
it was there untamed, uncrushed. Chauvelin himself could not deny
to himself its presence or its force. He felt that behind that
smooth brow, which looked waxlike now, the mind was still alert,
scheming, plotting, striving for freedom, for conquest and for
power, and rendered even doubly keen and virile by the ardour of
supreme self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Chauvelin now made a slight movement and suddenly Blakeney
became conscious of his presence, and swift as a flash a smile lit
up his wan face.</p>

<p>"Why! if it is not my engaging friend Monsieur Chambertin," he
said gaily.</p>

<p>He rose and stepped forward in the most approved fashion
prescribed by the elaborate etiquette of the time. But Chauvelin
smiled grimly and a look of almost animal lust gleamed in his pale
eyes, for he had noted that as he rose Sir Percy had to seek the
support of the table, even whilst a dull film appeared to gather
over his eyes.</p>

<p>The gesture had been quick and cleverly disguised, but it had
been there nevertheless&mdash;that and the livid hue that
overspread the face as if consciousness was threatening to go. All
of which was sufficient still further to assure the looker-on that
that mighty physical strength was giving way at last, that strength
which he had hated in his enemy almost as much as he had hated the
thinly veiled insolence of his manner.</p>

<p>"And what procures me, sir, the honour of your visit?" continued
Blakeney, who had&mdash;at any rate, outwardly soon recovered
himself, and whose voice, though distinctly hoarse and spent, rang
quite cheerfully across the dank narrow cell.</p>

<p>"My desire for your welfare, Sir Percy," replied Chauvelin with
equal pleasantry.</p>

<p>"La, sir; but have you not gratified that desire already, to an
extent which leaves no room for further solicitude? But I pray you,
will you not sit down?" he continued, turning back toward the
table. "I was about to partake of the lavish supper which your
friends have provided for me. Will you not share it, sir? You are
most royally welcome, and it will mayhap remind you of that supper
we shared together in Calais, eh? when you, Monsieur Chambertin,
were temporarily in holy orders."</p>

<p>He laughed, offering his enemy a chair, and pointed with
inviting gesture to the hunk of brown bread and the mug of water
which stood on the table.</p>

<p>"Such as it is, sir," he said with a pleasant smile, "it is
yours to command."</p>

<p>Chauvelin sat down. He held his lower lip tightly between his
teeth, so tightly that a few drops of blood appeared upon its
narrow surface. He was making vigorous efforts to keep his temper
under control, for he would not give his enemy the satisfaction of
seeing him resent his insolence. He could afford to keep calm now
that victory was at last in sight, now that he knew that he had but
to raise a finger, and those smiling, impudent lips would be closed
forever at last.</p>

<p>"Sir Percy," he resumed quietly, "no doubt it affords you a
certain amount of pleasure to aim your sarcastic shafts at me. I
will not begrudge you that pleasure; in your present position, sir,
your shafts have little or no sting."</p>

<p>"And I shall have but few chances left to aim them at your
charming self," interposed Blakeney, who had drawn another chair
close to the table and was now sitting opposite his enemy, with the
light of the lamp falling full on his own face, as if he wished his
enemy to know that he had nothing to hide, no thought, no hope, no
fear.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Chauvelin dryly. "That being the case, Sir
Percy, what say you to no longer wasting the few chances which are
left to you for safety? The time is getting on. You are not, I
imagine, quite as hopeful as you were even a week ago...you have
never been over-comfortable in this cell, why not end this
unpleasant state of affairs now&mdash;once and for all? You'll not
have cause to regret it. My word on it."</p>

<p>Sir Percy leaned back in his chair. He yawned loudly and
ostentatiously.</p>

<p>"I pray you, sir, forgive me," he said. "Never have I been so
d----d fatigued. I have not slept for more than a fortnight."</p>

<p>"Exactly, Sir Percy. A night's rest would do you a world of
good."</p>

<p>"A night, sir?" exclaimed Blakeney with what seemed like an echo
of his former inimitable laugh. "La! I should want a week."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we could not arrange for that, but one night would
greatly refresh you."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir, you are right; but those d----d fellows in
the next room make so much noise."</p>

<p>"I would give strict orders that perfect quietude reigned in the
guard-room this night," said Chauvelin, murmuring softly, and there
was a gentle purr in his voice, "and that you were left undisturbed
for several hours. I would give orders that a comforting supper be
served to you at once, and that everything be done to minister to
your wants."</p>

<p>"That sounds d----d alluring, sir. Why did you not suggest this
before?"</p>

<p>"You were so&mdash;what shall I say&mdash;so obstinate, Sir
Percy?"</p>

<p>"Call it pig-headed, my dear Monsieur Chambertin," retorted
Blakeney gaily, "truly you would oblige me."</p>

<p>"In any case you, sir, were acting in direct opposition to your
own interests."</p>

<p>"Therefore you came," concluded Blakeney airily, "like the good
Samaritan to take compassion on me and my troubles, and to lead me
straight away to comfort, a good supper and a downy bed."</p>

<p>"Admirably put, Sir Percy," said Chauvelin blandly; "that is
exactly my mission."</p>

<p>"How will you set to work, Monsieur Chambertin?"</p>

<p>"Quite easily, if you, Sir Percy, will yield to the persuasion
of my friend citizen Héron."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Why, yes! He is anxious to know where little Capet is. A
reasonable whim, you will own, considering that the disappearance
of the child is causing him grave anxiety."</p>

<p>"And you, Monsieur Chambertin?" queried Sir Percy with that
suspicion of insolence in his manner which had the power to
irritate his enemy even now. "And yourself, sir; what are your
wishes in the matter?"</p>

<p>"Mine, Sir Percy?" retorted Chauvelin. "Mine? Why, to tell you
the truth, the fate of little Capet interests me but little. Let
him rot in Austria or in our prisons, I care not which. He'll never
trouble France overmuch, I imagine. The teachings of old Simon will
not tend to make a leader or a king out of the puny brat whom you
chose to drag out of our keeping. My wishes, sir, are the
annihilation of your accursed League, and the lasting disgrace, if
not the death, of its chief."</p>

<p>He had spoken more hotly than he had intended, but all the
pent-up rage of the past eighteen months, the recollections of
Calais and of Boulogne, had all surged up again in his mind,
because despite the closeness of these prison walls, despite the
grim shadow of starvation and of death that beckoned so close at
hand, he still encountered a pair of mocking eyes, fixed with
relentless insolence upon him.</p>

<p>Whilst he spoke Blakeney had once more leaned forward, resting
his elbows upon the table. Now he drew nearer to him the wooden
platter on which reposed that very uninviting piece of dry bread.
With solemn intentness he proceeded to break the bread into pieces;
then he offered the platter to Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said pleasantly, "that I cannot offer you more
dainty fare, sir, but this is all that your friends have supplied
me with to-day."</p>

<p>He crumbled some of the dry bread in his slender fingers, then
started munching the crumbs with apparent relish. He poured out
some water into the mug and drank it. Then he said with a light
laugh:</p>

<p>"Even the vinegar which that ruffian Brogard served us at Calais
was preferable to this, do you not imagine so, my good Monsieur
Chambertin?"</p>

<p>Chauvelin made no reply. Like a feline creature on the prowl, he
was watching the prey that had so nearly succumbed to his talons.
Blakeney's face now was positively ghastly. The effort to speak, to
laugh, to appear unconcerned, was apparently beyond his strength.
His cheeks and lips were livid in hue, the skin clung like a thin
layer of wax to the bones of cheek and jaw, and the heavy lids that
fell over the eyes had purple patches on them like lead.</p>

<p>To a system in such an advanced state of exhaustion the stale
water and dusty bread must have been terribly nauseating, and
Chauvelin himself callous and thirsting for vengeance though he
was, could hardly bear to look calmly on the martyrdom of this man
whom he and his colleagues were torturing in order to gain their
own ends.</p>

<p>An ashen hue, which seemed like the shadow of the hand of death,
passed over the prisoner's face. Chauvelin felt compelled to avert
his gaze. A feeling that was almost akin to remorse had stirred a
hidden chord in his heart. The feeling did not last&mdash;the heart
had been too long atrophied by the constantly recurring spectacles
of cruelties, massacres, and wholesale hecatombs perpetrated in the
past eighteen months in the name of liberty and fraternity to be
capable of a sustained effort in the direction of gentleness or of
pity. Any noble instinct in these revolutionaries had long ago been
drowned in a whirlpool of exploits that would forever sully the
records of humanity; and this keeping of a fellow-creature on the
rack in order to wring from him a Judas-like betrayal was but a
complement to a record of infamy that had ceased by its very
magnitude to weigh upon their souls.</p>

<p>Chauvelin was in no way different from his colleagues; the
crimes in which he had had no hand he had condoned by continuing to
serve the Government that had committed them, and his ferocity in
the present case was increased a thousandfold by his personal
hatred for the man who had so often fooled and baffled him.</p>

<p>When he looked round a second or two later that ephemeral fit of
remorse did its final vanishing; he had once more encountered the
pleasant smile, the laughing if ashen-pale face of his unconquered
foe.</p>

<p>"Only a passing giddiness, my dear sir," said Sir Percy lightly.
"As you were saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the airily-spoken words, at the smile that accompanied them,
Chauvelin had jumped to his feet. There was something almost
supernatural, weird, and impish about the present situation, about
this dying man who, like an impudent schoolboy, seemed to be
mocking Death with his tongue in his cheek, about his laugh that
appeared to find its echo in a widely yawning grave.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, Sir Percy," he said roughly, as he brought
his clenched fist crashing down upon the table, "this situation is
intolerable. Bring it to an end to-night!"</p>

<p>"Why, sir?" retorted Blakeney, "methought you and your kind did
not believe in God."</p>

<p>"No. But you English do."</p>

<p>"We do. But we do not care to hear His name on your lips."</p>

<p>"Then in the name of the wife whom you love&mdash;"</p>

<p>But even before the words had died upon his lips, Sir Percy,
too, had risen to his feet.</p>

<p>"Have done, man&mdash;have done," he broke in hoarsely, and
despite weakness, despite exhaustion and weariness, there was such
a dangerous look in his hollow eyes as he leaned across the table
that Chauvelin drew back a step or two, and&mdash;vaguely
fearful&mdash;looked furtively towards the opening into the
guard-room. "Have done," he reiterated for the third time; "do not
name her, or by the living God whom you dared to invoke I'll find
strength yet to smite you in the face."</p>

<p>But Chauvelin, after that first moment of almost superstitious
fear, had quickly recovered his <i>sang-froid</i>.</p>

<p>"Little Capet, Sir Percy," he said, meeting the other's
threatening glance with an imperturbable smile, "tell me where to
find him, and you may yet live to savour the caresses of the most
beautiful woman in England."</p>

<p>He had meant it as a taunt, the final turn of the thumb-screw
applied to a dying man, and he had in that watchful, keen mind of
his well weighed the full consequences of the taunt.</p>

<p>The next moment he had paid to the full the anticipated price.
Sir Percy had picked up the pewter mug from the table&mdash;it was
half-filled with brackish water&mdash;and with a hand that trembled
but slightly he hurled it straight at his opponent's face.</p>

<p>The heavy mug did not hit citizen Chauvelin; it went crashing
against the stone wall opposite. But the water was trickling from
the top of his head all down his eyes and cheeks. He shrugged his
shoulders with a look of benign indulgence directed at his enemy,
who had fallen back into his chair exhausted with the effort.</p>

<p>Then he took out his handkerchief and calmly wiped the water
from his face.</p>

<p>"Not quite so straight a shot as you used to be, Sir Percy," he
said mockingly.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;apparently&mdash;not."</p>

<p>The words came out in gasps. He was like a man only partly
conscious. The lips were parted, the eyes closed, the head leaning
against the high back of the chair. For the space of one second
Chauvelin feared that his zeal had outrun his prudence, that he had
dealt a death-blow to a man in the last stage of exhaustion, where
he had only wished to fan the flickering flame of life.
Hastily&mdash;for the seconds seemed precious&mdash;he ran to the
opening that led into the guard-room.</p>

<p>"Brandy&mdash;quick!" he cried.</p>

<p>Héron looked up, roused from the semi-somnolence in which he had
lain for the past half-hour. He disentangled his long limbs from
out the guard-room chair.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he queried. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Brandy," reiterated Chauvelin impatiently; "the prisoner has
fainted."</p>

<p>"Bah!" retorted the other with a callous shrug of the shoulders,
"you are not going to revive him with brandy, I imagine."</p>

<p>"No. But you will, citizen Héron," rejoined the other dryly,
"for if you do not he'll be dead in an hour!"</p>

<p>"Devils in hell!" exclaimed Héron, "you have not killed him?
You&mdash;you d----d fool!"</p>

<p>He was wide awake enough now; wide awake and shaking with fury.
Almost foaming at the mouth and uttering volleys of the choicest
oaths, he elbowed his way roughly through the groups of soldiers
who were crowding round the centre table of the guard-room, smoking
and throwing dice or playing cards. They made way for him as
hurriedly as they could, for it was not safe to thwart the citizen
agent when he was in a rage.</p>

<p>Héron walked across to the opening and lifted the iron bar. With
scant ceremony he pushed his colleague aside and strode into the
cell, whilst Chauvelin, seemingly not resenting the other's
ruffianly manners and violent language, followed close upon his
heel.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room both men paused, and Héron turned with
a surly growl to his friend.</p>

<p>"You vowed he would be dead in an hour," he said
reproachfully.</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It does not look like it now certainly," he said dryly.</p>

<p>Blakeney was sitting&mdash;as was his wont&mdash;close to the
table, with one arm leaning on it, the other, tightly clenched,
resting upon his knee. A ghost of a smile hovered round his
lips.</p>

<p>"Not in an hour, citizen Héron," he said, and his voice flow was
scarce above a whisper, "nor yet in two."</p>

<p>"You are a fool, man," said Héron roughly. "You have had
seventeen days of this. Are you not sick of it?"</p>

<p>"Heartily, my dear friend," replied Blakeney a little more
firmly.</p>

<p>"Seventeen days," reiterated the other, nodding his shaggy head;
"you came here on the 2nd of Pluviôse, today is the 19th."</p>

<p>"The 19th Pluviôse?" interposed Sir Percy, and a strange gleam
suddenly flashed in his eyes. "Demn it, sir, and in Christian
parlance what may that day be?"</p>

<p>"The 7th of February at your service, Sir Percy," replied
Chauvelin quietly.</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir. In this d----d hole I had lost count of
time."</p>

<p>Chauvelin, unlike his rough and blundering colleague, had been
watching the prisoner very closely for the last moment or two,
conscious of a subtle, undefinable change that had come over the
man during those few seconds while he, Chauvelin, had thought him
dying. The pose was certainly the old familiar one, the head erect,
the hand clenched, the eyes looking through and beyond the stone
walls; but there was an air of listlessness in the stoop of the
shoulders, and&mdash;except for that one brief gleam just
now&mdash;a look of more complete weariness round the hollow eyes!
To the keen watcher it appeared as if that sense of living power,
of unconquered will and defiant mind was no longer there, and as if
he himself need no longer fear that almost supersensual thrill
which had a while ago kindled in him a vague sense of
admiration&mdash;almost of remorse.</p>

<p>Even as he gazed, Blakeney slowly turned his eyes full upon him.
Chauvelin's heart gave a triumphant bound.</p>

<p>With a mocking smile he met the wearied look, the pitiable
appeal. His turn had come at last&mdash;his turn to mock and to
exult. He knew that what he was watching now was no longer the last
phase of a long and noble martyrdom; it was the end&mdash;the
inevitable end&mdash;that for which he had schemed and striven, for
which he had schooled his heart to ferocity and callousness that
were devilish in their intensity. It was the end indeed, the slow
descent of a soul from the giddy heights of attempted
self-sacrifice, where it had striven to soar for a time, until the
body and the will both succumbed together and dragged it down with
them into the abyss of submission and of irreparable shame.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>Chapter 36. Submission</h2>

<p>Silence reigned in the narrow cell for a few moments, whilst two
human jackals stood motionless over their captured prey.</p>

<p>A savage triumph gleamed in Chauvelin's eyes, and even Héron,
dull and brutal though he was, had become vaguely conscious of the
great change that had come over the prisoner.</p>

<p>Blakeney, with a gesture and a sigh of hopeless exhaustion had
once more rested both his elbows on the table; his head fell heavy
and almost lifeless downward in his arms.</p>

<p>"Curse you, man!" cried Héron almost involuntarily. "Why in the
name of hell did you wait so long?"</p>

<p>Then, as the prisoner made no reply, but only raised his head
slightly, and looked on the other two men with dulled, wearied
eyes, Chauvelin interposed calmly:</p>

<p>"More than a fortnight has been wasted in useless obstinacy, Sir
Percy. Fortunately it is not too late."</p>

<p>"Capet?" said Héron hoarsely, "tell us, where is Capet?"</p>

<p>He leaned across the table, his eyes were bloodshot with the
keenness of his excitement, his voice shook with the passionate
desire for the crowning triumph.</p>

<p>"If you'll only not worry me," murmured the prisoner; and the
whisper came so laboriously and so low that both men were forced to
bend their ears close to the scarcely moving lips; "if you will let
me sleep and rest, and leave me in peace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The peace of the grave, man," retorted Chauvelin roughly; "if
you will only speak. Where is Capet?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you; the way is long, the
road&mdash;intricate."</p>

<p>"Bah!"</p>

<p>"I'll lead you to him, if you will give me rest."</p>

<p>"We don't want you to lead us anywhere," growled Héron with a
smothered curse; "tell us where Capet is; we'll find him right
enough."</p>

<p>"I cannot explain; the way is intricate; the place off the
beaten track, unknown except to me and my friends."</p>

<p>Once more that shadow, which was so like the passing of the hand
of Death, overspread the prisoner's face; his head rolled back
against the chair.</p>

<p>"He'll die before he can speak," muttered Chauvelin under his
breath. "You usually are well provided with brandy, citizen
Héron."</p>

<p>The latter no longer demurred. He saw the danger as clearly as
did his colleague. It had been hell's own luck if the prisoner were
to die now when he seemed ready to give in. He produced a flask
from the pocket of his coat, and this he held to Blakeney's
lips.</p>

<p>"Beastly stuff," murmured the latter feebly. "I think I'd sooner
faint&mdash;than drink."</p>

<p>"Capet? where is Capet?" reiterated Héron impatiently.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three hundred leagues from here. I must let
one of my friends know; he'll communicate with the others; they
must be prepared," replied the prisoner slowly.</p>

<p>Héron uttered a blasphemous oath.</p>

<p>"Where is Capet? Tell us where Capet is, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was like a raging tiger that had thought to hold its prey and
suddenly realised that it was being snatched from him. He raised
his fist, and without doubt the next moment he would have silenced
forever the lips that held the precious secret, but Chauvelin
fortunately was quick enough to seize his wrist.</p>

<p>"Have a care, citizen," he said peremptorily; "have a care! You
called me a fool just now when you thought I had killed the
prisoner. It is his secret we want first; his death can follow
afterwards."</p>

<p>"Yes, but not in this d----d hole," murmured Blakeney.</p>

<p>"On the guillotine if you'll speak," cried Héron, whose
exasperation was getting the better of his self-interest, "but if
you'll not speak then it shall be starvation in this
hole&mdash;yes, starvation," he growled, showing a row of large and
uneven teeth like those of some mongrel cur, "for I'll have that
door walled in to-night, and not another living soul shall cross
this threshold again until your flesh has rotted on your bones and
the rats have had their fill of you."</p>

<p>The prisoner raised his head slowly, a shiver shook him as if
caused by ague, and his eyes, that appeared almost sightless, now
looked with a strange glance of horror on his enemy.</p>

<p>"I'll die in the open," he whispered, "not in this d----d
hole."</p>

<p>"Then tell us where Capet is."</p>

<p>"I cannot; I wish to God I could. But I'll take you to him, I
swear I will. I'll make my friends give him up to you. Do you think
that I would not tell you now, if I could."</p>

<p>Héron, whose every instinct of tyranny revolted against this
thwarting of his will, would have continued to heckle the prisoner
even now, had not Chauvelin suddenly interposed with an
authoritative gesture.</p>

<p>"You'll gain nothing this way, citizen," he said quietly; "the
man's mind is wandering; he is probably quite unable to give you
clear directions at this moment."</p>

<p>"What am I to do, then?" muttered the other roughly.</p>

<p>"He cannot live another twenty-four hours now, and would only
grow more and more helpless as time went on. "Unless you relax your
strict régime with him."</p>

<p>"And if I do we'll only prolong this situation indefinitely; and
in the meanwhile how do we know that the brat is not being spirited
away out of the country?"</p>

<p>The prisoner, with his head once more buried in his arms, had
fallen into a kind of torpor, the only kind of sleep that the
exhausted system would allow. With a brutal gesture Héron shook him
by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"<i>Hé</i>," he shouted, "none of that, you know. We have not
settled the matter of young Capet yet."</p>

<p>Then, as the prisoner made no movement, and the chief agent
indulged in one of his favourite volleys of oaths, Chauvelin placed
a peremptory hand on his colleague's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I tell you, citizen, that this is no use," he said firmly.
"Unless you are prepared to give up all thoughts of finding Capet,
you must try and curb your temper, and try diplomacy where force is
sure to fail."</p>

<p>"Diplomacy?" retorted the other with a sneer. "Bah! it served
you well at Boulogne last autumn, did it not, citizen
Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>"It has served me better now," rejoined the other imperturbably.
"You will own, citizen, that it is my diplomacy which has placed
within your reach the ultimate hope of finding Capet."</p>

<p>"H'm!" muttered the other, "you advised us to starve the
prisoner. Are we any nearer to knowing his secret?"</p>

<p>"Yes. By a fortnight of weariness, of exhaustion and of
starvation, you are nearer to it by the weakness of the man whom in
his full strength you could never hope to conquer."</p>

<p>"But if the cursed Englishman won't speak, and in the meanwhile
dies on my hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He won't do that if you will accede to his wish. Give him some
good food now, and let him sleep till dawn."</p>

<p>"And at dawn he'll defy me again. I believe now that he has some
scheme in his mind, and means to play us a trick."</p>

<p>"That, I imagine, is more than likely," retorted Chauvelin
dryly; "though," he added with a contemptuous nod of the head
directed at the huddled-up figure of his once brilliant enemy,
"neither mind nor body seem to me to be in a sufficiently active
state just now for hatching plot or intrigue; but even
if&mdash;vaguely floating through his clouded mind&mdash;there has
sprung some little scheme for evasion, I give you my word, citizen
Héron, that you can thwart him completely, and gain all that you
desire, if you will only follow my advice."</p>

<p>There had always been a great amount of persuasive power in
citizen Chauvelin, ex-envoy of the revolutionary Government of
France at the Court of St. James, and that same persuasive
eloquence did not fail now in its effect on the chief agent of the
Committee of General Security. The latter was made of coarser stuff
than his more brilliant colleague. Chauvelin was like a wily and
sleek panther that is furtive in its movements, that will lure its
prey, watch it, follow it with stealthy footsteps, and only pounce
on it when it is least wary, whilst Héron was more like a raging
bull that tosses its head in a blind, irresponsible fashion, rushes
at an obstacle without gauging its resisting powers, and allows its
victim to slip from beneath its weight through the very clumsiness
and brutality of its assault.</p>

<p>Still Chauvelin had two heavy black marks against
him&mdash;those of his failures at Calais and Boulogne. Héron,
rendered cautious both by the deadly danger in which he stood and
the sense of his own incompetence to deal with the present
situation, tried to resist the other's authority as well as his
persuasion.</p>

<p>"Your advice was not of great use to citizen Collot last autumn
at Boulogne," he said, and spat on the ground by way of expressing
both his independence and his contempt.</p>

<p>"Still, citizen Héron," retorted Chauvelin with unruffled
patience, "it is the best advice that you are likely to get in the
present emergency. You have eyes to see, have you not? Look on your
prisoner at this moment. Unless something is done, and at once,
too, he will be past negotiating with in the next twenty-four
hours; then what will follow?"</p>

<p>He put his thin hand once more on his colleague's grubby
coat-sleeve, he drew him closer to himself away from the vicinity
of that huddled figure, that captive lion, wrapped in a torpid
somnolence that looked already so like the last long sleep.</p>

<p>"What will follow, citizen Héron?" he reiterated, sinking his
voice to a whisper; "sooner or later some meddlesome busybody who
sits in the Assembly of the Convention will get wind that little
Capet is no longer in the Temple prison, that a pauper child was
substituted for him, and that you, citizen Héron, together with the
commissaries in charge, have thus been fooling the nation and its
representatives for over a fortnight. What will follow then, think
you?"</p>

<p>And he made an expressive gesture with his outstretched fingers
across his throat.</p>

<p>Héron found no other answer but blasphemy.</p>

<p>"I'll make that cursed Englishman speak yet," he said with a
fierce oath.</p>

<p>"You cannot," retorted Chauvelin decisively. "In his present
state he is incapable of it, even if he would, which also is
doubtful."</p>

<p>"Ah! then you do think that he still means to cheat us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. But I also know that he is no longer in a physical
state to do it. No doubt he thinks that he is. A man of that type
is sure to overvalue his own strength; but look at him, citizen
Héron. Surely you must see that we have nothing to fear from him
now."</p>

<p>Héron now was like a voracious creature that has two victims
lying ready for his gluttonous jaws. He was loath to let either of
them go. He hated the very thought of seeing the Englishman being
led out of this narrow cell, where he had kept a watchful eye over
him night and day for a fortnight, satisfied that with every day,
every hour, the chances of escape became more improbable and more
rare; at the same time there was the possibility of the recapture
of little Capet, a possibility which made Héron's brain reel with
the delightful vista of it, and which might never come about if the
prisoner remained silent to the end.</p>

<p>"I wish I were quite sure," he said sullenly, "that you were
body and soul in accord with me."</p>

<p>"I am in accord with you, citizen Héron," rejoined the other
earnestly&mdash;"body and soul in accord with you. Do you not
believe that I hate this man&mdash;aye! hate him with a hatred ten
thousand times more strong than yours? I want his
death&mdash;Heaven or hell alone know how I long for that&mdash;but
what I long for most is his lasting disgrace. For that I have
worked, citizen Héron&mdash;for that I advised and helped you. When
first you captured this man you wanted summarily to try him, to
send him to the guillotine amidst the joy of the populace of Paris,
and crowned with a splendid halo of martyrdom. That man, citizen
Héron, would have baffled you, mocked you, and fooled you even on
the steps of the scaffold. In the zenith of his strength and of
insurmountable good luck you and all your myrmidons and all the
assembled guard of Paris would have had no power over him. The day
that you led him out of this cell in order to take him to trial or
to the guillotine would have been that of your hopeless
discomfiture. Having once walked out of this cell hale, hearty and
alert, be the escort round him ever so strong, he never would have
re-entered it again. Of that I am as convinced as that I am alive.
I know the man; you don't. Mine are not the only fingers through
which he has slipped. Ask citizen Collot d'Herbois, ask Sergeant
Bibot at the barrier of Ménilmontant, ask General Santerre and his
guards. They all have a tale to tell. Did I believe in God or the
devil, I should also believe that this man has supernatural powers
and a host of demons at his beck and call."</p>

<p>"Yet you talk now of letting him walk out of this cell
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"He is a different man now, citizen Héron. On my advice you
placed him on a régime that has counteracted the supernatural power
by simple physical exhaustion, and driven to the four winds the
host of demons who no doubt fled in the face of starvation."</p>

<p>"If only I thought that the recapture of Capet was as vital to
you as it is to me," said Héron, still unconvinced.</p>

<p>"The capture of Capet is just as vital to me as it is to you,"
rejoined Chauvelin earnestly, "if it is brought about through the
instrumentality of the Englishman."</p>

<p>He paused, looking intently on his colleague, whose shifty eyes
encountered his own. Thus eye to eye the two men at last understood
one another.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Héron with a snort, "I think I understand."</p>

<p>"I am sure that you do," responded Chauvelin dryly. "The
disgrace of this cursed Scarlet Pimpernel and his League is as
vital to me, and more, as the capture of Capet is to you. That is
why I showed you the way how to bring that meddlesome adventurer to
his knees; that is why I will help you now both to find Capet and
with his aid and to wreak what reprisals you like on him in the
end."</p>

<p>Héron before he spoke again cast one more look on the prisoner.
The latter had not stirred; his face was hidden, but the hands,
emaciated, nerveless and waxen, like those of the dead, told a more
eloquent tale, mayhap, then than the eyes could do. The chief agent
of the Committee of General Security walked deliberately round the
table until he stood once more close beside the man from whom he
longed with passionate ardour to wrest an all-important secret.
With brutal, grimy hand he raised the head that lay, sunken and
inert, against the table; with callous eyes he gazed attentively on
the face that was then revealed to him, he looked on the waxen
flesh, the hollow eyes, the bloodless lips; then he shrugged his
wide shoulders, and with a laugh that surely must have caused joy
in hell, he allowed the wearied head to fall back against the
outstretched arms, and turned once again to his colleague.</p>

<p>"I think you are right, citizen Chauvelin," he said; "there is
not much supernatural power here. Let me hear your advice."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>Chapter 37. Chauvelin's
Advice</h2>

<p>Citizen Chauvelin had drawn his colleague with him to the end of
the cell that was farthest away from the recess, and the table at
which the prisoner was sitting.</p>

<p>Here the noise and hubbub that went on constantly in the guard
room would effectually drown a whispered conversation. Chauvelin
called to the sergeant to hand him a couple of chairs over the
barrier. These he placed against the wall opposite the opening, and
beckoning Héron to sit down, he did likewise, placing himself close
to his colleague.</p>

<p>From where the two men now sat they could see both into the
guard-room opposite them and into the recess at the furthermost end
of the cell.</p>

<p>"First of all," began Chauvelin after a while, and sinking his
voice to a whisper, "let me understand you thoroughly, citizen
Héron. Do you want the death of the Englishman, either to-day or
to-morrow, either in this prison or on the guillotine? For that now
is easy of accomplishment; or do you want, above all, to get hold
of little Capet?"</p>

<p>"It is Capet I want," growled Héron savagely under his breath.
"Capet! Capet! My own neck is dependent on my finding Capet. Curse
you, have I not told you that clearly enough?"</p>

<p>"You have told it me very clearly, citizen Héron; but I wished
to make assurance doubly sure, and also make you understand that I,
too, want the Englishman to betray little Capet into your hands. I
want that more even than I do his death."</p>

<p>"Then in the name of hell, citizen, give me your advice."</p>

<p>"My advice to you, citizen Héron, is this: Give your prisoner
now just a sufficiency of food to revive him&mdash;he will have had
a few moments' sleep&mdash;and when he has eaten, and, mayhap,
drunk a glass of wine, he will, no doubt, feel a recrudescence of
strength, then give him pen and ink and paper. He must, as he says,
write to one of his followers, who, in his turn, I suppose, will
communicate with the others, bidding them to be prepared to deliver
up little Capet to us; the letter must make it clear to that crowd
of English gentlemen that their beloved chief is giving up the
uncrowned King of France to us in exchange for his own safety. But
I think you will agree with me, citizen Héron, that it would not be
over-prudent on our part to allow that same gallant crowd to be
forewarned too soon of the proposed doings of their chief.
Therefore, I think, we'll explain to the prisoner that his
follower, whom he will first apprise of his intentions, shall start
with us to-morrow on our expedition, and accompany us until its
last stage, when, if it is found necessary, he may be sent on
ahead, strongly escorted of course, and with personal messages from
the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel to the members of his League."</p>

<p>"What will be the good of that?" broke in Héron viciously. "Do
you want one of his accursed followers to be ready to give him a
helping hand on the way if he tries to slip through our
fingers?"</p>

<p>"Patience, patience, my good Héron!" rejoined Chauvelin with a
placid smile. "Hear me out to the end. Time is precious. You shall
offer what criticism you will when I have finished, but not
before."</p>

<p>"Go on, then. I listen."</p>

<p>"I am not only proposing that one member of the Scarlet
Pimpernel League shall accompany us to-morrow," continued
Chauvelin, "but I would also force the prisoner's
wife&mdash;Marguerite Blakeney&mdash;to follow in our train."</p>

<p>"A woman? Bah! What for?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you the reason of this presently. In her case I
should not let the prisoner know beforehand that she too will form
a part of our expedition. Let this come as a pleasing surprise for
him. She could join us on our way out of Paris."</p>

<p>"How will you get hold of her?"</p>

<p>"Easily enough. I know where to find her. I traced her myself a
few days ago to a house in the Rue de Charonne, and she is not
likely to have gone away from Paris while her husband was at the
Conciergerie. But this is a digression, let me proceed more
consecutively. The letter, as I have said, being written to-night
by the prisoner to one of his followers, I will myself see that it
is delivered into the right hands. You, citizen Héron, will in the
meanwhile make all arrangements for the journey. We ought to start
at dawn, and we ought to be prepared, especially during the first
fifty leagues of the way, against organised attack in case the
Englishman leads us into an ambush."</p>

<p>"Yes. He might even do that, curse him!" muttered Héron.</p>

<p>"He might, but it is unlikely. Still it is best to be prepared.
Take a strong escort, citizen, say twenty or thirty men, picked and
trained soldiers who would make short work of civilians, however
well-armed they might be. There are twenty members&mdash;including
the chief&mdash;in that Scarlet Pimpernel League, and I do not
quite see how from this cell the prisoner could organise an
ambuscade against us at a given time. Anyhow, that is a matter for
you to decide. I have still to place before you a scheme which is a
measure of safety for ourselves and our men against ambush as well
as against trickery, and which I feel sure you will pronounce quite
adequate."</p>

<p>"Let me hear it, then!"</p>

<p>"The prisoner will have to travel by coach, of course. You can
travel with him, if you like, and put him in irons, and thus avert
all chances of his escaping on the road. But"&mdash;and here
Chauvelin made a long pause, which had the effect of holding his
colleague's attention still more closely&mdash;"remember that we
shall have his wife and one of his friends with us. Before we
finally leave Paris tomorrow we will explain to the prisoner that
at the first attempt to escape on his part, at the slightest
suspicion that he has tricked us for his own ends or is leading us
into an ambush&mdash;at the slightest suspicion, I say&mdash;you,
citizen Héron, will order his friend first, and then Marguerite
Blakeney herself, to be summarily shot before his eyes."</p>

<p>Héron gave a long, low whistle. Instinctively he threw a
furtive, backward glance at the prisoner, then he raised his shifty
eyes to his colleague.</p>

<p>There was unbounded admiration expressed in them. One blackguard
had met another&mdash;a greater one than himself&mdash;and was
proud to acknowledge him as his master.</p>

<p>"By Lucifer, citizen Chauvelin," he said at last, "I should
never have thought of such a thing myself."</p>

<p>Chauvelin put up his hand with a gesture of
self-deprecation.</p>

<p>"I certainly think that measure ought to be adequate," he said
with a gentle air of assumed modesty, "unless you would prefer to
arrest the woman and lodge her here, keeping her here as an
hostage."</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Héron with a gruff laugh; "that idea does not
appeal to me nearly so much as the other. I should not feel so
secure on the way...I should always be thinking that that cursed
woman had been allowed to escape...No! no! I would rather keep her
under my own eye&mdash;just as you suggest, citizen Chauvelin...and
under the prisoner's, too," he added with a coarse jest. "If he did
not actually see her, he might be more ready to try and save
himself at her expense. But, of course, he could not see her shot
before his eyes. It is a perfect plan, citizen, and does you
infinite credit; and if the Englishman tricked us," he concluded
with a fierce and savage oath, "and we did not find Capet at the
end of the journey, I would gladly strangle his wife and his friend
with my own hands."</p>

<p>"A satisfaction which I would not begrudge you, citizen," said
Chauvelin dryly. "Perhaps you are right...the woman had best be
kept under your own eye...the prisoner will never risk her safety
on that, I would stake my life. We'll deliver our final
'either&mdash;or' the moment that she has joined our party, and
before we start further on our way. Now, citizen Héron, you have
heard my advice; are you prepared to follow it?"</p>

<p>"To the last letter," replied the other.</p>

<p>And their two hands met in a grasp of mutual
understanding&mdash;two hands already indelibly stained with much
innocent blood, more deeply stained now with seventeen past days of
inhumanity and miserable treachery to come.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter 38. Capitulation</h2>

<p>What occurred within the inner cell of the Conciergerie prison
within the next half-hour of that 16th day of Pluviôse in the year
II of the Republic is, perhaps, too well known to history to need
or bear overfull repetition.</p>

<p>Chroniclers intimate with the inner history of those infamous
days have told us how the chief agent of the Committee of General
Security gave orders one hour after midnight that hot soup, white
bread and wine be served to the prisoner, who for close on fourteen
days previously had been kept on short rations of black bread and
water; the sergeant in charge of the guard-room watch for the night
also received strict orders that that same prisoner was on no
account to be disturbed until the hour of six in the morning, when
he was to be served with anything in the way of breakfast that he
might fancy.</p>

<p>All this we know, and also that citizen Héron, having given all
necessary orders for the morning's expedition, returned to the
Conciergerie, and found his colleague Chauvelin waiting for him in
the guard-room.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked with febrile impatience&mdash;"the
prisoner?"</p>

<p>"He seems better and stronger," replied Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"Not too well, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No, no, only just well enough."</p>

<p>"You have seen him&mdash;since his supper?"</p>

<p>"Only from the doorway. It seems he ate and drank hardly at all,
and the sergeant had some difficulty in keeping him awake until you
came."</p>

<p>"Well, now for the letter," concluded Héron with the same marked
feverishness of manner which sat so curiously on his uncouth
personality. "Pen, ink and paper, sergeant!" he commanded.</p>

<p>"On the table, in the prisoner's cell, citizen," replied the
sergeant.</p>

<p>He preceded the two citizens across the guard-room to the
doorway, and raised for them the iron bar, lowering it back after
them.</p>

<p>The next moment Héron and Chauvelin were once more face to face
with their prisoner.</p>

<p>Whether by accident or design the lamp had been so placed that
as the two men approached its light fell full upon their faces,
while that of the prisoner remained in shadow. He was leaning
forward with both elbows on the table, his thin, tapering fingers
toying with the pen and ink-horn which had been placed close to his
hand.</p>

<p>"I trust that everything has been arranged for your comfort, Sir
Percy?" Chauvelin asked with a sarcastic little smile.</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," replied Blakeney politely.</p>

<p>"You feel refreshed, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Greatly so, I assure you. But I am still demmed sleepy; and if
you would kindly be brief&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have not changed your mind, sir?" queried Chauvelin, and a
note of anxiety, which he vainly tried to conceal, quivered in his
voice.</p>

<p>"No, my good M. Chambertin," replied Blakeney with the same
urbane courtesy, "I have not changed my mind."</p>

<p>A sigh of relief escaped the lips of both the men. The prisoner
certainly had spoken in a clearer and firmer voice; but whatever
renewed strength wine and food had imparted to him he apparently
did not mean to employ in renewed obstinacy. Chauvelin, after a
moment's pause, resumed more calmly:</p>

<p>"You are prepared to direct us to the place where little Capet
lies hidden?"</p>

<p>"I am prepared to do anything, sir, to get out of this d----d
hole."</p>

<p>"Very well. My colleague, citizen Héron, has arranged for an
escort of twenty men picked from the best regiment of the Garde de
Paris to accompany us&mdash;yourself, him and me&mdash;to wherever
you will direct us. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, sir."</p>

<p>"You must not imagine for a moment that we, on the other hand,
guarantee to give you your life and freedom even if this expedition
prove unsuccessful."</p>

<p>"I would not venture on suggesting such a wild proposition,
sir," said Blakeney placidly.</p>

<p>Chauvelin looked keenly on him. There was something in the tone
of that voice that he did not altogether like&mdash;something that
reminded him of an evening at Calais, and yet again of a day at
Boulogne. He could not read the expression in the eyes, so with a
quick gesture he pulled the lamp forward so that its light now fell
full on the face of the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is certainly better, is it not, my dear M.
Chambertin?" said Sir Percy, beaming on his adversary with a
pleasant smile.</p>

<p>His face, though still of the same ashen hue, looked serene if
hopelessly wearied; the eyes seemed to mock. But this Chauvelin
decided in himself must have been a trick of his own overwrought
fancy. After a brief moment's pause he resumed dryly:</p>

<p>"If, however, the expedition turns out successful in every
way&mdash;if little Capet, without much trouble to our escort,
falls safe and sound into our hands&mdash;if certain contingencies
which I am about to tell you all fall out as we wish&mdash;then,
Sir Percy, I see no reason why the Government of this country
should not exercise its prerogative of mercy towards you after
all."</p>

<p>"An exercise, my dear M. Chambertin, which must have wearied
through frequent repetition," retorted Blakeney with the same
imperturbable smile.</p>

<p>"The contingency at present is somewhat remote; when the time
comes we'll talk this matter over...I will make no promise...and,
anyhow, we can discuss it later."</p>

<p>"At present we are but wasting our valuable time over so
trifling a matter...If you'll excuse me, sir...I am so demmed
fatigued&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you will be glad to have everything settled quickly, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir."</p>

<p>Héron was taking no part in the present conversation. He knew
that his temper was not likely to remain within bounds, and though
he had nothing but contempt for his colleague's courtly manners,
yet vaguely in his stupid, blundering way he grudgingly admitted
that mayhap it was better to allow citizen Chauvelin to deal with
the Englishman. There was always the danger that if his own violent
temper got the better of him, he might even at this eleventh hour
order this insolent prisoner to summary trial and the guillotine,
and thus lose the final chance of the more important capture.</p>

<p>He was sprawling on a chair in his usual slouching manner with
his big head sunk between his broad shoulders, his shifty,
prominent eyes wandering restlessly from the face of his colleague
to that of the other man.</p>

<p>But now he gave a grunt of impatience.</p>

<p>"We are wasting time, citizen Chauvelin," he muttered. "I have
still a great deal to see to if we are to start at dawn. Get the
d----d letter written, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest of the phrase was lost in an indistinct and surly
murmur. Chauvelin, after a shrug of the shoulders, paid no further
heed to him; he turned, bland and urbane, once more to the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"I see with pleasure, Sir Percy," he said, "that we thoroughly
understand one another. Having had a few hours' rest you will, I
know, feel quite ready for the expedition. Will you kindly indicate
to me the direction in which we will have to travel?"</p>

<p>"Northwards all the way."</p>

<p>"Towards the coast?"</p>

<p>"The place to which we must go is about seven leagues from the
sea."</p>

<p>"Our first objective then will be Beauvais, Amiens, Abbeville,
Crécy, and so on?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"As far as the forest of Boulogne, shall we say?"</p>

<p>"Where we shall come off the beaten track, and you will have to
trust to my guidance."</p>

<p>"We might go there now, Sir Percy, and leave you here."</p>

<p>"You might. But you would not then find the child. Seven leagues
is not far from the coast. He might slip through your fingers."</p>

<p>"And my colleague Héron, being disappointed, would inevitably
send you to the guillotine."</p>

<p>"Quite so," rejoined the prisoner placidly. "Methought, sir,
that we had decided that I should lead this little expedition?
Surely," he added, "it is not so much the Dauphin whom you want as
my share in this betrayal."</p>

<p>"You are right as usual, Sir Percy. Therefore let us take that
as settled. We go as far as Crécy, and thence place ourselves
entirely in your hands."</p>

<p>"The journey should not take more than three days, sir."</p>

<p>"During which you will travel in a coach in the company of my
friend Héron."</p>

<p>"I could have chosen pleasanter company, sir; still, it will
serve."</p>

<p>"This being settled, Sir Percy. I understand that you desire to
communicate with one of your followers."</p>

<p>"Some one must let the others know...those who have the Dauphin
in their charge."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Therefore I pray you write to one of your friends
that you have decided to deliver the Dauphin into our hands in
exchange for your own safety."</p>

<p>"You said just now that this you would not guarantee,"
interposed Blakeney quietly.</p>

<p>"If all turns out well," retorted Chauvelin with a show of
contempt, "and if you will write the exact letter which I shall
dictate, we might even give you that guarantee."</p>

<p>"The quality of your mercy, sir, passes belief."</p>

<p>"Then I pray you write. Which of your followers will have the
honour of the communication?"</p>

<p>"My brother-in-law, Armand St. Just; he is still in Paris, I
believe. He can let the others know."</p>

<p>Chauvelin made no immediate reply. He paused awhile, hesitating.
Would Sir Percy Blakeney be ready&mdash;if his own safety demanded
it&mdash;to sacrifice the man who had betrayed him? In the
momentous "either&mdash;or" that was to be put to him, by-and-by,
would he choose his own life and leave Armand St. Just to perish?
It was not for Chauvelin&mdash;or any man of his stamp&mdash;to
judge of what Blakeney would do under such circumstances, and had
it been a question of St. Just alone, mayhap Chauvelin would have
hesitated still more at the present juncture.</p>

<p>But the friend as hostage was only destined to be a minor
leverage for the final breaking-up of the League of the Scarlet
Pimpernel through the disgrace of its chief. There was the
wife&mdash;Marguerite Blakeney&mdash;sister of St. Just, joint and
far more important hostage, whose very close affection for her
brother might prove an additional trump card in that handful which
Chauvelin already held.</p>

<p>Blakeney paid no heed seemingly to the other's hesitation. He
did not even look up at him, but quietly drew pen and paper towards
him, and made ready to write.</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to say?" he asked simply.</p>

<p>"Will that young blackguard answer your purpose, citizen
Chauvelin?" queried Héron roughly.</p>

<p>Obviously the same doubt had crossed his mind. Chauvelin quickly
re-assured him.</p>

<p>"Better than any one else," he said firmly. "Will you write at
my dictation, Sir Percy?"</p>

<p>"I am waiting to do so, my dear sir."</p>

<p>"Begin your letter as you wish, then; now continue."</p>

<p>And he began to dictate slowly, watching every word as it left
Blakeney's pen.</p>

<p>"'I cannot stand my present position any longer. Citizen Héron,
and also M. Chauvelin&mdash;' Yes, Sir Percy, Chauvelin, not
Chambertin ...C, H, A, U, V, E, L, I, N...That is quite
right&mdash;'have made this prison a perfect hell for me.'"</p>

<p>Sir Percy looked up from his writing, smiling.</p>

<p>"You wrong yourself, my dear M. Chambertin!" he said; "I have
really been most comfortable."</p>

<p>"I wish to place the matter before your friends in as indulgent
a manner as I can," retorted Chauvelin dryly.</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir. Pray proceed."</p>

<p>"...'a perfect hell for me,'" resumed the other. "Have you that?
... 'and I have been forced to give way. To-morrow we start from
here at dawn; and I will guide citizen Héron to the place where he
can find the Dauphin. But the authorities demand that one of my
followers, one who has once been a member of the League of the
Scarlet Pimpernel, shall accompany me on this expedition. I
therefore ask you'&mdash;or 'desire you' or 'beg
you'&mdash;whichever you prefer, Sir Percy..."</p>

<p>"'Ask you' will do quite nicely. This is really very
interesting, you know."</p>

<p>"...'to be prepared to join the expedition. We start at dawn,
and you would be required to be at the main gate of the house of
Justice at six o'clock precisely. I have an assurance from the
authorities that your life should be in-violate, but if you refuse
to accompany me, the guillotine will await me on the morrow.'"</p>

<p>"'The guillotine will await me on the morrow.' That sounds quite
cheerful, does it not, M. Chambertin?" said the prisoner, who had
not evinced the slightest surprise at the wording of the letter
whilst he wrote at the other's dictation. "Do you know, I quite
enjoyed writing this letter; it so reminded me of happy days in
Boulogne."</p>

<p>Chauvelin pressed his lips together. Truly now he felt that a
retort from him would have been undignified, more especially as
just at this moment there came from the guard room the sound of
men's voices talking and laughing, the occasional clang of steel,
or of a heavy boot against the tiled floor, the rattling of dice,
or a sudden burst of laughter&mdash;sounds, in fact, that betokened
the presence of a number of soldiers close by.</p>

<p>Chauvelin contented himself with a nod in the direction of the
guard-room.</p>

<p>"The conditions are somewhat different now," he said placidly,
"from those that reigned in Boulogne. But will you not sign your
letter, Sir Percy?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, sir," responded Blakeney, as with an elaborate
flourish of the pen he appended his name to the missive.</p>

<p>Chauvelin was watching him with eyes that would have shamed a
lynx by their keenness. He took up the completed letter, read it
through very carefully, as if to find some hidden meaning behind
the very words which he himself had dictated; he studied the
signature, and looked vainly for a mark or a sign that might convey
a different sense to that which he had intended. Finally, finding
none, he folded the letter up with his own hand, and at once
slipped it in the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>"Take care, M. Chambertin," said Blakeney lightly; "it will burn
a hole in that elegant vest of yours."</p>

<p>"It will have no time to do that, Sir Percy," retorted Chauvelin
blandly; "an you will furnish me with citizen St. Just's present
address, I will myself convey the letter to him at once."</p>

<p>"At this hour of the night? Poor old Armand, he'll be abed. But
his address, sir, is No. 32, Rue de la Croix Blanche, on the first
floor, the door on your right as you mount the stairs; you know the
room well, citizen Chauvelin; you have been in it before. And now,"
he added with a loud and ostentatious yawn, "shall we all to bed?
We start at dawn, you said, and I am so d----d fatigued."</p>

<p>Frankly, he did not look it now. Chauvelin himself, despite his
matured plans, despite all the precautions that he meant to take
for the success of this gigantic scheme, felt a sudden strange
sense of fear creeping into his bones. Half an hour ago he had seen
a man in what looked like the last stage of utter physical
exhaustion, a hunched up figure, listless and limp, hands that
twitched nervously, the face as of a dying man. Now those outward
symptoms were still there certainly; the face by the light of the
lamp still looked livid, the lips bloodless, the hands emaciated
and waxen, but the eyes!&mdash;they were still hollow, with heavy
lids still purple, but in their depths there was a curious,
mysterious light, a look that seemed to see something that was
hidden to natural sight.</p>

<p>Citizen Chauvelin thought that Héron, too, must be conscious of
this, but the Committee's agent was sprawling on a chair, sucking a
short-stemmed pipe, and gazing with entire animal satisfaction on
the prisoner.</p>

<p>"The most perfect piece of work we have ever accomplished, you
and I, citizen Chauvelin," he said complacently.</p>

<p>"You think that everything is quite satisfactory?" asked the
other with anxious stress on his words.</p>

<p>"Everything, of course. Now you see to the letter. I will give
final orders for to-morrow, but I shall sleep in the
guard-room."</p>

<p>"And I on that inviting bed," interposed the prisoner lightly,
as he rose to his feet. "Your servant, citizens!"</p>

<p>He bowed his head slightly, and stood by the table whilst the
two men prepared to go. Chauvelin took a final long look at the man
whom he firmly believed he had at last brought down to abject
disgrace.</p>

<p>Blakeney was standing erect, watching the two retreating
figures&mdash;one slender hand was on the table. Chauvelin saw that
it was leaning rather heavily, as if for support, and that even
whilst a final mocking laugh sped him and his colleague on their
way, the tall figure of the conquered lion swayed like a stalwart
oak that is forced to bend to the mighty fury of an all-compelling
wind.</p>

<p>With a sigh of content Chauvelin took his colleague by the arm,
and together the two men walked out of the cell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>Chapter 39. Kill Him!</h2>

<p>Two hours after midnight Armand St. Just was wakened from sleep
by a peremptory pull at his bell. In these days in Paris but one
meaning could as a rule be attached to such a summons at this hour
of the night, and Armand, though possessed of an unconditional
certificate of safety, sat up in bed, quite convinced that for some
reason which would presently be explained to him he had once more
been placed on the list of the "suspect," and that his trial and
condemnation on a trumped-up charge would follow in due course.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, he felt no fear at the prospect, and only a very
little sorrow. The sorrow was not for himself; he regretted neither
life nor happiness. Life had become hateful to him since happiness
had fled with it on the dark wings of dishonour; sorrow such as he
felt was only for Jeanne! She was very young, and would weep bitter
tears. She would be unhappy, because she truly loved him, and
because this would be the first cup of bitterness which life was
holding out to her. But she was very young, and sorrow would not be
eternal. It was better so. He, Armand St. Just, though he loved her
with an intensity of passion that had been magnified and
strengthened by his own overwhelming shame, had never really
brought his beloved one single moment of unalloyed happiness.</p>

<p>From the very first day when he sat beside her in the tiny
boudoir of the Square du Roule, and the heavy foot fall of Héron
and his bloodhounds broke in on their first kiss, down to this hour
which he believed struck his own death-knell, his love for her had
brought more tears to her dear eyes than smiles to her exquisite
mouth.</p>

<p>Her he had loved so dearly, that for her sweet sake he had
sacrificed honour, friendship and truth; to free her, as he
believed, from the hands of impious brutes he had done a deed that
cried Cain-like for vengeance to the very throne of God. For her he
had sinned, and because of that sin, even before it was committed,
their love had been blighted, and happiness had never been
theirs.</p>

<p>Now it was all over. He would pass out of her life, up the steps
of the scaffold, tasting as he mounted them the most entire
happiness that he had known since that awful day when he became a
Judas.</p>

<p>The peremptory summons, once more repeated, roused him from his
meditations. He lit a candle, and without troubling to slip any of
his clothes on, he crossed the narrow ante-chamber, and opened the
door that gave on the landing.</p>

<p>"In the name of the people!"</p>

<p>He had expected to hear not only those words, but also the
grounding of arms and the brief command to halt. He had expected to
see before him the white facings of the uniform of the Garde de
Paris, and to feel himself roughly pushed back into his lodging
preparatory to the search being made of all his effects and the
placing of irons on his wrists.</p>

<p>Instead of this, it was a quiet, dry voice that said without
undue harshness:</p>

<p>"In the name of the people!"</p>

<p>And instead of the uniforms, the bayonets and the scarlet caps
with tricolour cockades, he was confronted by a slight, sable-clad
figure, whose face, lit by the flickering light of the tallow
candle, looked strangely pale and earnest.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin!" gasped Armand, more surprised than
frightened at this unexpected apparition.</p>

<p>"Himself, citizen, at your service," replied Chauvelin with his
quiet, ironical manner. "I am the bearer of a letter for you from
Sir Percy Blakeney. Have I your permission to enter?"</p>

<p>Mechanically Armand stood aside, allowing the other man to pass
in. He closed the door behind his nocturnal visitor, then, taper in
hand, he preceded him into the inner room.</p>

<p>It was the same one in which a fortnight ago a fighting lion had
been brought to his knees. Now it lay wrapped in gloom, the feeble
light of the candle only lighting Armand's face and the white frill
of his shirt. The young man put the taper down on the table and
turned to his visitor.</p>

<p>"Shall I light the lamp?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Quite unnecessary," replied Chauvelin curtly. "I have only a
letter to deliver, and after that to ask you one brief
question."</p>

<p>From the pocket of his coat he drew the letter which Blakeney
had written an hour ago.</p>

<p>"The prisoner wrote this in my presence," he said as he handed
the letter over to Armand. "Will you read it?"</p>

<p>Armand took it from him, and sat down close to the table;
leaning forward he held the paper near the light, and began to
read. He read the letter through very slowly to the end, then once
again from the beginning. He was trying to do that which Chauvelin
had wished to do an hour ago; he was trying to find the inner
meaning which he felt must inevitably lie behind these words which
Percy had written with his own hand.</p>

<p>That these bare words were but a blind to deceive the enemy
Armand never doubted for a moment. In this he was as loyal as
Marguerite would have been herself. Never for a moment did the
suspicion cross his mind that Blakeney was about to play the part
of a coward, but he, Armand, felt that as a faithful friend and
follower he ought by instinct to know exactly what his chief
intended, what he meant him to do.</p>

<p>Swiftly his thoughts flew back to that other letter, the one
which Marguerite had given him&mdash;the letter full of pity and of
friendship which had brought him hope and a joy and peace which he
had thought at one time that he would never know again. And
suddenly one sentence in that letter stood out so clearly before
his eyes that it blurred the actual, tangible ones on the paper
which even now rustled in his hand.</p>

<p class="letter">But if at any time you receive another letter
from me&mdash;be its contents what they may&mdash;act in accordance
with the letter, but send a copy of it at once to Ffoulkes or to
Marguerite.</p>

<p>Now everything seemed at once quite clear; his duty, his next
actions, every word that he would speak to Chauvelin. Those that
Percy had written to him were already indelibly graven on his
memory.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had waited with his usual patience, silent and
imperturbable, while the young man read. Now when he saw that
Armand had finished, he said quietly:</p>

<p>"Just one question, citizen, and I need not detain you longer.
But first will you kindly give me back that letter? It is a
precious document which will for ever remain in the archives of the
nation."</p>

<p>But even while he spoke Armand, with one of those quick
intuitions that come in moments of acute crisis, had done just that
which he felt Blakeney would wish him to do. He had held the letter
close to the candle. A corner of the thin crisp paper immediately
caught fire, and before Chauvelin could utter a word of anger, or
make a movement to prevent the conflagration, the flames had licked
up fully one half of the letter, and Armand had only just time to
throw the remainder on the floor and to stamp out the blaze with
his foot.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, citizen," he said calmly; "an accident."</p>

<p>"A useless act of devotion," interposed Chauvelin, who already
had smothered the oath that had risen to his lips. "The Scarlet
Pimpernel's actions in the present matter will not lose their
merited publicity through the foolish destruction of this
document."</p>

<p>"I had no thought, citizen," retorted the young man, "of
commenting on the actions of my chief, or of trying to deny them
that publicity which you seem to desire for them almost as much as
I do."</p>

<p>"More, citizen, a great deal more! The impeccable Scarlet
Pimpernel, the noble and gallant English gentleman, has agreed to
deliver into our hands the uncrowned King of France&mdash;in
exchange for his own life and freedom. Methinks that even his worst
enemy would not wish for a better ending to a career of adventure,
and a reputation for bravery unequalled in Europe. But no more of
this, time is pressing, I must help citizen Héron with his final
preparations for his journey. You, of course, citizen St. Just,
will act in accordance with Sir Percy Blakeney's wishes?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Armand.</p>

<p>"You will present yourself at the main entrance of the house of
Justice at six o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"I will not fail you."</p>

<p>"A coach will be provided for you. You will follow the
expedition as hostage for the good faith of your chief."</p>

<p>"I quite understand."</p>

<p>"H'm! That's brave! You have no fear, citizen St. Just?"</p>

<p>"Fear of what, sir?"</p>

<p>"You will be a hostage in our hands, citizen; your life a
guarantee that your chief has no thought of playing us false. Now I
was thinking of&mdash;of certain events&mdash;which led to the
arrest of Sir Percy Blakeney."</p>

<p>"Of my treachery, you mean," rejoined the young man calmly, even
though his face had suddenly become pale as death. "Of the damnable
lie wherewith you cheated me into selling my honour, and made me
what I am&mdash;a creature scarce fit to walk upon this earth."</p>

<p>"Oh!" protested Chauvelin blandly.</p>

<p>"The damnable lie," continued Armand more vehemently, "that hath
made me one with Cain and the Iscariot. When you goaded me into the
hellish act, Jeanne Lange was already free."</p>

<p>"Free&mdash;but not safe."</p>

<p>"A lie, man! A lie! For which you are thrice accursed. Great
God, is it not you that should have cause for fear? Methinks were I
to strangle you now I should suffer less of remorse."</p>

<p>"And would be rendering your ex-chief but a sorry service,"
interposed Chauvelin with quiet irony. "Sir Percy Blakeney is a
dying man, citizen St. Just; he'll be a dead man at dawn if I do
not put in an appearance by six o'clock this morning. This is a
private understanding between citizen Héron and myself. We agreed
to it before I came to see you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you take care of your own miserable skin well enough! But
you need not be afraid of me&mdash;I take my orders from my chief,
and he has not ordered me to kill you."</p>

<p>"That was kind of him. Then we may count on you? You are not
afraid?"</p>

<p>"Afraid that the Scarlet Pimpernel would leave me in the lurch
because of the immeasurable wrong I have done to him?" retorted
Armand, proud and defiant in the name of his chief. "No, sir, I am
not afraid of that; I have spent the last fortnight in praying to
God that my life might yet be given for his."</p>

<p>"H'm! I think it most unlikely that your prayers will be
granted, citizen; prayers, I imagine, so very seldom are; but I
don't know, I never pray myself. In your case, now, I should say
that you have not the slightest chance of the Deity interfering in
so pleasant a manner. Even were Sir Percy Blakeney prepared to
wreak personal revenge on you, he would scarcely be so foolish as
to risk the other life which we shall also hold as hostage for his
good faith."</p>

<p>"The other life?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Your sister, Lady Blakeney, will also join the expedition
to-morrow. This Sir Percy does not yet know; but it will come as a
pleasant surprise for him. At the slightest suspicion of false play
on Sir Percy's part, at his slightest attempt at escape, your life
and that of your sister are forfeit; you will both be summarily
shot before his eyes. I do not think that I need be more precise,
eh, citizen St. Just?"</p>

<p>The young man was quivering with passion. A terrible loathing
for himself, for his crime which had been the precursor of this
terrible situation, filled his soul to the verge of sheer physical
nausea. A red film gathered before his eyes, and through it he saw
the grinning face of the inhuman monster who had planned this
hideous, abominable thing. It seemed to him as if in the silence
and the hush of the night, above the feeble, flickering flame that
threw weird shadows around, a group of devils were surrounding him,
and were shouting, "Kill him! Kill him now! Rid the earth of this
hellish brute!"</p>

<p>No doubt if Chauvelin had exhibited the slightest sign of fear,
if he had moved an inch towards the door, Armand, blind with
passion, driven to madness by agonising remorse more even than by
rage, would have sprung at his enemy's throat and crushed the life
out of him as he would out of a venomous beast. But the man's calm,
his immobility, recalled St. Just to himself. Reason, that had
almost yielded to passion again, found strength to drive the enemy
back this time, to whisper a warning, an admonition, even a
reminder. Enough harm, God knows, had been done by tempestuous
passion already. And God alone knew what terrible consequences its
triumph now might bring in its trial, and striking on Armand's
buzzing ears Chauvelin's words came back as a triumphant and
mocking echo:</p>

<p>"He'll be a dead man at dawn if I do not put in an appearance by
six o'clock."</p>

<p>The red film lifted, the candle flickered low, the devils
vanished, only the pale face of the Terrorist gazed with gentle
irony out of the gloom.</p>

<p>"I think that I need not detain you any longer, citizen, St.
Just," he said quietly; "you can get three or four hours' rest yet
before you need make a start, and I still have a great many things
to see to. I wish you good-night, citizen."</p>

<p>"Good-night," murmured Armand mechanically.</p>

<p>He took the candle and escorted his visitor back to the door. He
waited on the landing, taper in hand, while Chauvelin descended the
narrow, winding stairs.</p>

<p>There was a light in the concierge's lodge. No doubt the woman
had struck it when the nocturnal visitor had first demanded
admittance. His name and tricolour scarf of office had ensured him
the full measure of her attention, and now she was evidently
sitting up waiting to let him out.</p>

<p>St. Just, satisfied that Chauvelin had finally gone, now turned
back to his own rooms.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>Chapter 40. God Help Us All</h2>

<p>He carefully locked the outer door. Then he lit the lamp, for
the candle gave but a flickering light, and he had some important
work to do.</p>

<p>Firstly, he picked up the charred fragment of the letter, and
smoothed it out carefully and reverently as he would a relic. Tears
had gathered in his eyes, but he was not ashamed of them, for no
one saw them; but they eased his heart, and helped to strengthen
his resolve. It was a mere fragment that had been spared by the
flame, but Armand knew every word of the letter by heart.</p>

<p>He had pen, ink and paper ready to his hand, and from memory
wrote out a copy of it. To this he added a covering letter from
himself to Marguerite:</p>

<p class="letter">This&mdash;which I had from Percy through the
hands of Chauvelin&mdash;I neither question nor understand...He
wrote the letter, and I have no thought but to obey. In his
previous letter to me he enjoined me, if ever he wrote to me again,
to obey him implicitly, and to communicate with you. To both these
commands do I submit with a glad heart. But of this must I give you
warning, little mother&mdash;Chauvelin desires you also to
accompany us to-morrow...Percy does not know this yet, else he
would never start. But those fiends fear that his readiness is a
blind...and that he has some plan in his head for his own escape
and the continued safety of the Dauphin...This plan they hope to
frustrate through holding you and me as hostages for his good
faith. God only knows how gladly I would give my life for my
chief...but your life, dear little mother...is sacred above all...I
think that I do right in warning you. God help us all.</p>

<p>Having written the letter, he sealed it, together with the copy
of Percy's letter which he had made. Then he took up the candle and
went downstairs.</p>

<p>There was no longer any light in the concierge's lodge, and
Armand had some difficulty in making himself heard. At last the
woman came to the door. She was tired and cross after two
interruptions of her night's rest, but she had a partiality for her
young lodger, whose pleasant ways and easy liberality had been like
a pale ray of sunshine through the squalor of every-day misery.</p>

<p>"It is a letter, <i>citoyenne</i>," said Armand, with earnest
entreaty, "for my sister. She lives in the Rue de Charonne, near
the fortifications, and must have it within an hour; it is a matter
of life and death to her, to me, and to another who is very dear to
us both."</p>

<p>The concierge threw up her hands in horror.</p>

<p>"Rue de Charonne, near the fortifications," she exclaimed, "and
within an hour! By the Holy Virgin, citizen, that is impossible.
Who will take it? There is no way."</p>

<p>"A way must be found, <i>citoyenne</i>," said Armand firmly,
"and at once; it is not far, and there are five golden louis
waiting for the messenger!"</p>

<p>Five golden louis! The poor, hardworking woman's eyes gleamed at
the thought. Five louis meant food for at least two months if one
was careful, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me the letter, citizen," she said, "time to slip on a warm
petticoat and a shawl, and I'll go myself. It's not fit for the boy
to go at this hour."</p>

<p>"You will bring me back a line from my sister in reply to this,"
said Armand, whom circumstances had at last rendered cautious.
"Bring it up to my rooms that I may give you the five louis in
exchange."</p>

<p>He waited while the woman slipped back into her room. She heard
him speaking to her boy; the same lad who a fortnight ago had taken
the treacherous letter which had lured Blakeney to the house into
the fatal ambuscade that had been prepared for him. Everything
reminded Armand of that awful night, every hour that he had since
spent in the house had been racking torture to him. Now at last he
was to leave it, and on an errand which might help to ease the load
of remorse from his heart.</p>

<p>The woman was soon ready. Armand gave her final directions as to
how to find the house; then she took the letter and promised to be
very quick, and to bring back a reply from the lady.</p>

<p>Armand accompanied her to the door. The night was dark, a thin
drizzle was falling; he stood and watched until the woman's rapidly
walking figure was lost in the misty gloom.</p>

<p>Then with a heavy sigh he once more went within.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>Chapter 41. When Hope Was
Dead</h2>

<p>In a small upstairs room in the Rue de Charonne, above the shop
of Lucas the old-clothes dealer, Marguerite sat with Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes. Armand's letter, with its message and its warning, lay
open on the table between them, and she had in her hand the sealed
packet which Percy had given her just ten days ago, and which she
was only to open if all hope seemed to be dead, if nothing appeared
to stand any longer between that one dear life and irretrievable
shame.</p>

<p>A small lamp placed on the table threw a feeble yellow light on
the squalid, ill-furnished room, for it lacked still an hour or so
before dawn. Armand's concierge had brought her lodger's letter,
and Marguerite had quickly despatched a brief reply to him, a reply
that held love and also encouragement.</p>

<p>Then she had summoned Sir Andrew. He never had a thought of
leaving her during these days of dire trouble, and he had lodged
all this while in a tiny room on the top-most floor of this house
in the Rue de Charonne.</p>

<p>At her call he had come down very quickly, and now they sat
together at the table, with the oil-lamp illumining their pale,
anxious faces; she the wife and he the friend holding a
consultation together in this most miserable hour that preceded the
cold wintry dawn.</p>

<p>Outside a thin, persistent rain mixed with snow pattered against
the small window panes, and an icy wind found out all the crevices
in the worm-eaten woodwork that would afford it ingress to the
room. But neither Marguerite nor Ffoulkes was conscious of the
cold. They had wrapped their cloaks round their shoulders, and did
not feel the chill currents of air that caused the lamp to flicker
and to smoke.</p>

<p>"I can see now," said Marguerite in that calm voice which comes
so naturally in moments of infinite despair&mdash;"I can see now
exactly what Percy meant when he made me promise not to open this
packet until it seemed to me&mdash;to me and to you, Sir
Andrew&mdash;that he was about to play the part of a coward. A
coward! Great God!" She checked the sob that had risen to her
throat, and continued in the same calm manner and quiet, even
voice:</p>

<p>"You do think with me, do you not, that the time has come, and
that we must open this packet?"</p>

<p>"Without a doubt, Lady Blakeney," replied Ffoulkes with equal
earnestness. "I would stake my life that already a fortnight ago
Blakeney had that same plan in his mind which he has now matured.
Escape from that awful Conciergerie prison with all the precautions
so carefully taken against it was impossible. I knew that alas!
from the first. But in the open all might yet be different. I'll
not believe it that a man like Blakeney is destined to perish at
the hands of those curs."</p>

<p>She looked on her loyal friend with tear-dimmed eyes through
which shone boundless gratitude and heart-broken sorrow.</p>

<p>He had spoken of a fortnight! It was ten days since she had seen
Percy. It had then seemed as if death had already marked him with
its grim sign. Since then she had tried to shut away from her mind
the terrible visions which her anguish constantly conjured up
before her of his growing weakness, of the gradual impairing of
that brilliant intellect, the gradual exhaustion of that mighty
physical strength.</p>

<p>"God bless you, Sir Andrew, for your enthusiasm and for your
trust," she said with a sad little smile; "but for you I should
long ago have lost all courage, and these last ten days&mdash;what
a cycle of misery they represent&mdash;would have been maddening
but for your help and your loyalty. God knows I would have courage
for everything in life, for everything save one, but just that, his
death; that would be beyond my strength&mdash;neither reason nor
body could stand it. Therefore, I am so afraid, Sir Andrew," she
added piteously.</p>

<p>"Of what, Lady Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"That when he knows that I too am to go as hostage, as Armand
says in his letter, that my life is to be guarantee for his, I am
afraid that he will draw back&mdash;that he will&mdash;my God!" she
cried with sudden fervour, "tell me what to do!"</p>

<p>"Shall we open the packet?" asked Ffoulkes gently, "and then
just make up our minds to act exactly as Blakeney has enjoined us
to do, neither more nor less, but just word for word, deed for
deed, and I believe that that will be right&mdash;whatever may
betide&mdash;in the end."</p>

<p>Once more his quiet strength, his earnestness and his faith
comforted her. She dried her eyes and broke open the seal. There
were two separate letters in the packet, one unaddressed, obviously
intended for her and Ffoulkes, the other was addressed to M. le
baron Jean de Batz, 15, Rue St. Jean de Latran à Paris.</p>

<p>"A letter addressed to that awful Baron de Batz," said
Marguerite, looking with puzzled eyes on the paper as she turned it
over and over in her hand, "to that bombastic windbag! I know him
and his ways well! What can Percy have to say to him?"</p>

<p>Sir Andrew too looked puzzled. But neither of them had the mind
to waste time in useless speculations. Marguerite unfolded the
letter which was intended for her, and after a final look on her
friend, whose kind face was quivering with excitement, she began
slowly to read aloud:</p>

<p class="letter">I need not ask either of you two to trust me,
knowing that you will. But I could not die inside this hole like a
rat in a trap&mdash;I had to try and free myself, at the worst to
die in the open beneath God's sky. You two will understand, and
understanding you will trust me to the end. Send the enclosed
letter at once to its address. And you, Ffoulkes, my most sincere
and most loyal friend, I beg with all my soul to see to the safety
of Marguerite. Armand will stay by me&mdash;but you, Ffoulkes, do
not leave her, stand by her. As soon as you read this
letter&mdash;and you will not read it until both she and you have
felt that hope has fled and I myself am about to throw up the
sponge&mdash;try and persuade her to make for the coast as quickly
as may be...At Calais you can open up communications with the
<i>Daydream</i> in the usual way, and embark on her at once. Let no
member of the League remain on French soil one hour longer after
that. Then tell the skipper to make for Le Portel&mdash;the place
which he knows&mdash;and there to keep a sharp outlook for another
three nights. After that make straight for home, for it will be no
use waiting any longer. I shall not come. These measures are for
Marguerite's safety, and for you all who are in France at this
moment. Comrade, I entreat you to look on these measures as on my
dying wish. To de Batz I have given <i>rendezvous</i> at the
Chapelle of the Holy Sepulchre, just outside the park of the
Château d'Ourde. He will help me to save the Dauphin, and if by
good luck he also helps me to save myself I shall be within seven
leagues of Le Portel, and with the Liane frozen as she is I could
reach the coast.<br>
<br>
But Marguerite's safety I leave in your hands, Ffoulkes. Would that
I could look more clearly into the future, and know that those
devils will not drag her into danger. Beg her to start at once for
Calais immediately you have both read this. I only beg, I do not
command. I know that you, Ffoulkes, will stand by her whatever she
may wish to do. God's blessing be for ever on you both.</p>

<p>Marguerite's voice died away in the silence that still lay over
this deserted part of the great city and in this squalid house
where she and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had found shelter these last ten
days. The agony of mind which they had here endured, never
doubting, but scarcely ever hoping, had found its culmination at
last in this final message, which almost seemed to come to them
from the grave.</p>

<p>It had been written ten days ago. A plan had then apparently
formed in Percy's mind which he had set forth during the brief
half-hour's respite which those fiends had once given him. Since
then they had never given him ten consecutive minutes' peace; since
then ten days had gone by; how much power, how much vitality had
gone by too on the leaden wings of all those terrible hours spent
in solitude and in misery?</p>

<p>"We can but hope, Lady Blakeney," said Sir Andrew Ffoulkes after
a while, "that you will be allowed out of Paris; but from what
Armand says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Percy does not actually send me away," she rejoined with a
pathetic little smile.</p>

<p>"No. He cannot compel you, Lady Blakeney. You are not a member
of the League."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am!" she retorted firmly; "and I have sworn
obedience, just as all of you have done. I will go, just as he bids
me, and you, Sir Andrew, you will obey him too?"</p>

<p>"My orders are to stand by you. That is an easy task."</p>

<p>"You know where this place is?" she asked&mdash;"the Château
d'Ourde?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we all know it! It is empty, and the park is a wreck;
the owner fled from it at the very outbreak of the revolution; he
left some kind of steward nominally in charge, a curious creature,
half imbecile; the château and the chapel in the forest just
outside the grounds have oft served Blakeney and all of us as a
place of refuge on our way to the coast."</p>

<p>"But the Dauphin is not there?" she said.</p>

<p>"No. According to the first letter which you brought me from
Blakeney ten days ago, and on which I acted, Tony, who has charge
of the Dauphin, must have crossed into Holland with his little
Majesty to-day."</p>

<p>"I understand," she said simply. "But then&mdash;this letter to
de Batz?"</p>

<p>"Ah, there I am completely at sea! But I'll deliver it, and at
once too, only I don't like to leave you. Will you let me get you
out of Paris first? I think just before dawn it could be done. We
can get the cart from Lucas, and if we could reach St. Germain
before noon, I could come straight back then and deliver the letter
to de Batz. This, I feel, I ought to do myself; but at Achard's
farm I would know that you were safe for a few hours."</p>

<p>"I will do whatever you think right, Sir Andrew," she said
simply; "my will is bound up with Percy's dying wish. God knows I
would rather follow him now, step by step,&mdash;as hostage, as
prisoner&mdash;any way so long as I can see him, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose and turned to go, almost impassive now in that great
calm born of despair.</p>

<p>A stranger seeing her now had thought her indifferent. She was
very pale, and deep circles round her eyes told of sleepless nights
and days of mental misery, but otherwise there was not the faintest
outward symptom of that terrible anguish which was rending her
heartstrings. Her lips did not quiver, and the source of her tears
had been dried up ten days ago.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes and I'll be ready, Sir Andrew," she said. "I have
but few belongings. Will you the while see Lucas about the
cart?"</p>

<p>He did as she desired. Her calm in no way deceived him; he knew
that she must be suffering keenly, and would suffer more keenly
still while she would be trying to efface her own personal feelings
all through that coming dreary journey to Calais.</p>

<p>He went to see the landlord about the horse and cart, and a
quarter of an hour later Marguerite came downstairs ready to start.
She found Sir Andrew in close converse with an officer of the Garde
de Paris, whilst two soldiers of the same regiment were standing at
the horse's head.</p>

<p>When she appeared in the doorway Sir Andrew came at once up to
her.</p>

<p>"It is just as I feared, Lady Blakeney," he said; "this man has
been sent here to take charge of you. Of course, he knows nothing
beyond the fact that his orders are to convey you at once to the
guard-house of the Rue Ste. Anne, where he is to hand you over to
citizen Chauvelin of the Committee of Public Safety."</p>

<p>Sir Andrew could not fail to see the look of intense relief
which, in the midst of all her sorrow, seemed suddenly to have
lighted up the whole of Marguerite's wan face. The thought of
wending her own way to safety whilst Percy, mayhap, was fighting an
uneven fight with death had been well-nigh intolerable; but she had
been ready to obey without a murmur. Now Fate and the enemy himself
had decided otherwise. She felt as if a load had been lifted from
her heart.</p>

<p>"I will at once go and find de Batz," Sir Andrew contrived to
whisper hurriedly. "As soon as Percy's letter is safely in his
hands I will make my way northwards and communicate with all the
members of the League, on whom the chief has so strictly enjoined
to quit French soil immediately. We will proceed to Calais first
and open up communication with the <i>Daydream</i> in the usual
way. The others had best embark on board her, and the skipper shall
then make for the known spot of Le Portel, of which Percy speaks in
his letter. I myself will go by land to Le Portel, and thence, if I
have no news of you or of the expedition, I will slowly work
southwards in the direction of the Château d'Ourde. That is all
that I can do. If you can contrive to let Percy or even Armand know
my movements, do so by all means. I know that I shall be doing
right, for, in a way, I shall be watching over you and arranging
for your safety, as Blakeney begged me to do. God bless you, Lady
Blakeney, and God save the Scarlet Pimpernel!"</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her hand, and she intimated to the officer
that she was ready. He had a hackney coach waiting for her lower
down the street. To it she walked with a firm step, and as she
entered it she waved a last farewell to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>Chapter 42. The Guard-House Of The
Rue Ste. Anne</h2>

<p>The little <i>cortège</i> was turning out of the great gates of
the house of Justice. It was intensely cold; a bitter
north-easterly gale was blowing from across the heights of
Montmartre, driving sleet and snow and half-frozen rain into the
faces of the men, and finding its way up their sleeves, down their
collars and round the knees of their threadbare breeches.</p>

<p>Armand, whose fingers were numb with the cold, could scarcely
feel the reins in his hands. Chauvelin was riding close beside him,
but the two men had not exchanged one word since the moment when
the small troop of some twenty mounted soldiers had filed up inside
the courtyard, and Chauvelin, with a curt word of command, had
ordered one of the troopers to take Armand's horse on the lead.</p>

<p>A hackney coach brought up the rear of the <i>cortège</i>, with
a man riding at either door and two more following at a distance of
twenty paces. Héron's gaunt, ugly face, crowned with a battered,
sugar-loaf hat, appeared from time to time at the window of the
coach. He was no horseman, and, moreover, preferred to keep the
prisoner closely under his own eye. The corporal had told Armand
that the prisoner was with citizen Héron inside the coach&mdash;in
irons. Beyond that the soldiers could tell him nothing; they knew
nothing of the object of this expedition. Vaguely they might have
wondered in their dull minds why this particular prisoner was thus
being escorted out of the Conciergerie prison with so much
paraphernalia and such an air of mystery, when there were thousands
of prisoners in the city and the provinces at the present moment
who anon would be bundled up wholesale into carts to be dragged to
the guillotine like a flock of sheep to the butchers.</p>

<p>But even if they wondered they made no remarks among themselves.
Their faces, blue with the cold, were the perfect mirrors of their
own unconquerable stolidity.</p>

<p>The tower clock of Notre Dame struck seven when the small
cavalcade finally moved slowly out of the monumental gates. In the
east the wan light of a February morning slowly struggled out of
the surrounding gloom. Now the towers of many churches loomed
ghostlike against the dull grey sky, and down below, on the right,
the frozen river, like a smooth sheet of steel, wound its graceful
curves round the islands and past the facçde of the Louvres palace,
whose walls looked grim and silent, like the mausoleum of the dead
giants of the past.</p>

<p>All around the great city gave signs of awakening; the business
of the day renewed its course every twenty-four hours, despite the
tragedies of death and of dishonour that walked with it hand in
hand. From the Place de La Révolution the intermittent roll of
drums came from time to time with its muffled sound striking the
ear of the passer-by. Along the quay opposite an open-air camp was
already astir; men, women, and children engaged in the great task
of clothing and feeding the people of France, armed against
tyranny, were bending to their task, even before the wintry dawn
had spread its pale grey tints over the narrower streets of the
city.</p>

<p>Armand shivered under his cloak. This silent ride beneath the
leaden sky, through the veil of half-frozen rain and snow, seemed
like a dream to him. And now, as the outriders of the little
cavalcade turned to cross the Pont au Change, he saw spread out on
his left what appeared like the living panorama of these three
weeks that had just gone by. He could see the house of the Rue St.
Germain l'Auxerrois where Percy had lodged before he carried
through the rescue of the little Dauphin. Armand could even see the
window at which the dreamer had stood, weaving noble dreams that
his brilliant daring had turned into realities, until the hand of a
traitor had brought him down to&mdash;to what? Armand would not
have dared at this moment to look back at that hideous, vulgar
hackney coach wherein that proud, reckless adventurer, who had
defied Fate and mocked Death, sat, in chains, beside a loathsome
creature whose very propinquity was an outrage.</p>

<p>Now they were passing under the very house on the Quai de La
Ferraille, above the saddler's shop, the house where Marguerite had
lodged ten days ago, whither Armand had come, trying to fool
himself into the belief that the love of "little mother" could be
deceived into blindness against his own crime. He had tried to draw
a veil before those eyes which he had scarcely dared encounter, but
he knew that that veil must lift one day, and then a curse would
send him forth, outlawed and homeless, a wanderer on the face of
the earth.</p>

<p>Soon as the little <i>cortège</i> wended its way northwards it
filed out beneath the walls of the Temple prison; there was the
main gate with its sentry standing at attention, there the archway
with the <i>guichet</i> of the concierge, and beyond it the paved
courtyard. Armand closed his eyes deliberately; he could not bear
to look.</p>

<p>No wonder that he shivered and tried to draw his cloak closer
around him. Every stone, every street corner was full of memories.
The chill that struck to the very marrow of his bones came from no
outward cause; it was the very hand of remorse that, as it passed
over him, froze the blood in his veins and made the rattle of those
wheels behind him sound like a hellish knell.</p>

<p>At last the more closely populated quarters of the city were
left behind. On ahead the first section of the guard had turned
into the Rue St. Anne. The houses became more sparse, intersected
by narrow pieces of <i>terrains vagues</i>, or small weed-covered
bits of kitchen garden.</p>

<p>Then a halt was called.</p>

<p>It was quite light now. As light as it would ever be beneath
this leaden sky. Rain and snow still fell in gusts, driven by the
blast.</p>

<p>Some one ordered Armand to dismount. It was probably Chauvelin.
He did as he was told, and a trooper led him to the door of an
irregular brick building that stood isolated on the right, extended
on either side by a low wall, and surrounded by a patch of
uncultivated land, which now looked like a sea of mud.</p>

<p>On ahead was the line of fortifications dimly outlined against
the grey of the sky, and in between brown, sodden earth, with here
and there a detached house, a cabbage patch, a couple of windmills
deserted and desolate.</p>

<p>The loneliness of an unpopulated outlying quarter of the great
mother city, a useless limb of her active body, an ostracised
member of her vast family.</p>

<p>Mechanically Armand had followed the soldier to the door of the
building. Here Chauvelin was standing, and bade him follow. A smell
of hot coffee hung in the dark narrow passage in front. Chauvelin
led the way to a room on the left.</p>

<p>Still that smell of hot coffee. Ever after it was associated in
Armand's mind with this awful morning in the guard-house of the Rue
Ste. Anne, when the rain and snow beat against the windows, and he
stood there in the low guard-room shivering and half-numbed with
cold.</p>

<p>There was a table in the middle of the room, and on it stood
cups of hot coffee. Chauvelin bade him drink, suggesting, not
unkindly, that the warm beverage would do him good. Armand advanced
further into the room, and saw that there were wooden benches all
round against the wall. On one of these sat his sister
Marguerite.</p>

<p>When she saw him she made a sudden, instinctive movement to go
to him, but Chauvelin interposed in his usual bland, quiet
manner.</p>

<p>"Not just now, citizeness," he said.</p>

<p>She sat down again, and Armand noted how cold and stony seemed
her eyes, as if life within her was at a stand-still, and a shadow
that was almost like death had atrophied every emotion in her.</p>

<p>"I trust you have not suffered too much from the cold, Lady
Blakeney," resumed Chauvelin politely; "we ought not to have kept
you waiting here for so long, but delay at departure is sometimes
inevitable."</p>

<p>She made no reply, only acknowledging his reiterated inquiry as
to her comfort with an inclination of the head.</p>

<p>Armand had forced himself to swallow some coffee, and for the
moment he felt less chilled. He held the cup between his two hands,
and gradually some warmth crept into his bones.</p>

<p>"Little mother," he said in English, "try and drink some of
this, it will do you good."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear," she replied. "I have had some. I am not
cold."</p>

<p>Then a door at the end of the room was pushed open, and Héron
stalked in.</p>

<p>"Are we going to be all day in this confounded hole?" he queried
roughly.</p>

<p>Armand, who was watching his sister very closely, saw that she
started at the sight of the wretch, and seemed immediately to
shrink still further within herself, whilst her eyes, suddenly
luminous and dilated, rested on him like those of a captive bird
upon an approaching cobra.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin was not to be shaken out of his suave manner.</p>

<p>"One moment, citizen Héron," he said; "this coffee is very
comforting. Is the prisoner with you?" he added lightly.</p>

<p>Héron nodded in the direction of the other room.</p>

<p>"In there," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, if you will be so good, citizen, to invite him
thither, I could explain to him his future position and our
own."</p>

<p>Héron muttered something between his fleshy lips, then he turned
back towards the open door, solemnly spat twice on the threshold,
and nodded his gaunt head once or twice in a manner which
apparently was understood from within.</p>

<p>"No, sergeant, I don't want you," he said gruffly; "only the
prisoner."</p>

<p>A second or two later Sir Percy Blakeney stood in the doorway;
his hands were behind his back, obviously hand-cuffed, but he held
himself very erect, though it was clear that this caused him a
mighty effort. As soon as he had crossed the threshold his quick
glance had swept right round the room.</p>

<p>He saw Armand, and his eyes lit up almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of Marguerite, and his pale face took on
suddenly a more ashen hue.</p>

<p>Chauvelin was watching him with those keen, light-coloured eyes
of his. Blakeney, conscious of this, made no movement, only his
lips tightened, and the heavy lids fell over the hollow eyes,
completely hiding their glance.</p>

<p>But what even the most astute, most deadly enemy could not see
was that subtle message of understanding that passed at once
between Marguerite and the man she loved; it was a magnetic
current, intangible, invisible to all save to her and to him. She
was prepared to see him, prepared to see in him all that she had
feared; the weakness, the mental exhaustion, the submission to the
inevitable. Therefore she had also schooled her glance to express
to him all that she knew she would not be allowed to say&mdash;the
reassurance that she had read his last letter, that she had obeyed
it to the last word, save where Fate and her enemy had interfered
with regard to herself.</p>

<p>With a slight, imperceptible movement&mdash;imperceptible to
every one save to him, she had seemed to handle a piece of paper in
her kerchief, then she had nodded slowly, with her
eyes&mdash;steadfast, reassuring&mdash;fixed upon him, and his
glance gave answer that he had understood.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin and Héron had seen nothing of this. They were
satisfied that there had been no communication between the prisoner
and his wife and friend.</p>

<p>"You are no doubt surprised, Sir Percy," said Chauvelin after a
while, "to see Lady Blakeney here. She, as well as citizen St.
Just, will accompany our expedition to the place where you will
lead us. We none of us know where that place is&mdash;citizen Héron
and myself are entirely in your hands&mdash;you might be leading us
to certain death, or again to a spot where your own escape would be
an easy matter to yourself. You will not be surprised, therefore,
that we have thought fit to take certain precautions both against
any little ambuscade which you may have prepared for us, or against
your making one of those daring attempts at escape for which the
noted Scarlet Pimpernel is so justly famous."</p>

<p>He paused, and only Héron's low chuckle of satisfaction broke
the momentary silence that followed. Blakeney made no reply.
Obviously he knew exactly what was coming. He knew Chauvelin and
his ways, knew the kind of tortuous conception that would find
origin in his brain; the moment that he saw Marguerite sitting
there he must have guessed that Chauvelin once more desired to put
her precious life in the balance of his intrigues.</p>

<p>"Citizen Héron is impatient, Sir Percy," resumed Chauvelin after
a while, "so I must be brief. Lady Blakeney, as well as citizen St.
Just, will accompany us on this expedition to whithersoever you may
lead us. They will be the hostages which we will hold against your
own good faith. At the slightest suspicion&mdash;a mere suspicion
perhaps&mdash;that you have played us false, at a hint that you
have led us into an ambush, or that the whole of this expedition
has been but a trick on your part to effect your own escape, or if
merely our hope of finding Capet at the end of our journey is
frustrated, the lives of our two hostages belong to us, and your
friend and your wife will be summarily shot before your eyes."</p>

<p>Outside the rain pattered against the window-panes, the gale
whistled mournfully among the stunted trees, but within this room
not a sound stirred the deadly stillness of the air, and yet at
this moment hatred and love, savage lust and sublime
self-abnegation&mdash;the most power full passions the heart of man
can know&mdash;held three men here enchained; each a slave to his
dominant passion, each ready to stake his all for the satisfaction
of his master. Héron was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said with a fierce oath, "what are we waiting for?
The prisoner knows how he stands. Now we can go."</p>

<p>"One moment, citizen," interposed Chauvelin, his quiet manner
contrasting strangely with his colleague's savage mood. "You have
quite understood, Sir Percy," he continued, directly addressing the
prisoner, "the conditions under which we are all of us about to
proceed on this journey?"</p>

<p>"All of us?" said Blakeney slowly. "Are you taking it for
granted then that I accept your conditions and that I am prepared
to proceed on the journey?"</p>

<p>"If you do not proceed on the journey," cried Héron with savage
fury, "I'll strangle that woman with my own hands&mdash;now!"</p>

<p>Blakeney looked at him for a moment or two through half-closed
lids, and it seemed then to those who knew him well, to those who
loved him and to the man who hated him, that the mighty sinews
almost cracked with the passionate desire to kill. Then the sunken
eyes turned slowly to Marguerite, and she alone caught the
look&mdash;it was a mere flash, of a humble appeal for pardon.</p>

<p>It was all over in a second; almost immediately the tension on
the pale face relaxed, and into the eyes there came that look of
acceptance&mdash;nearly akin to fatalism&mdash;an acceptance of
which the strong alone are capable, for with them it only comes in
the face of the inevitable.</p>

<p>Now he shrugged his broad shoulders, and once more turning to
Héron he said quietly:</p>

<p>"You leave me no option in that case. As you have remarked
before, citizen Héron, why should we wait any longer? Surely we can
now go."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>Chapter 43. The Dreary
Journey</h2>

<p>Rain! Rain! Rain! Incessant, monotonous and dreary! The wind had
changed round to the southwest. It blew now in great gusts that
sent weird, sighing sounds through the trees, and drove the heavy
showers into the faces of the men as they rode on, with heads bent
forward against the gale.</p>

<p>The rain-sodden bridles slipped through their hands, bringing
out sores and blisters on their palms; the horses were fidgety,
tossing their heads with wearying persistence as the wet trickled
into their ears, or the sharp, intermittent hailstones struck their
sensitive noses.</p>

<p>Three days of this awful monotony, varied only by the halts at
wayside inns, the changing of troops at one of the guard-houses on
the way, the reiterated commands given to the fresh squad before
starting on the next lap of this strange, momentous way; and all
the while, audible above the clatter of horses' hoofs, the rumbling
of coach-wheels&mdash;two closed carriages, each drawn by a pair of
sturdy horses; which were changed at every halt. A soldier on each
box urged them to a good pace to keep up with the troopers, who
were allowed to go at an easy canter or light jog-trot, whatever
might prove easiest and least fatiguing. And from time to time
Héron's shaggy, gaunt head would appear at the window of one of the
coaches, asking the way, the distance to the next city or to the
nearest wayside inn; cursing the troopers, the coachman, his
colleague and every one concerned, blaspheming against the
interminable length of the road, against the cold and against the
wet.</p>

<p>Early in the evening on the second day of the journey he had met
with an accident. The prisoner, who presumably was weak and weary,
and not over steady on his feet, had fallen up against him as they
were both about to re-enter the coach after a halt just outside
Amiens, and citizen Héron had lost his footing in the slippery mud
of the road. His head came in violent contact with the step, and
his right temple was severely cut. Since then he had been forced to
wear a bandage across the top of his face, under his sugar-loaf
hat, which had added nothing to his beauty, but a great deal to the
violence of his temper. He wanted to push the men on, to force the
pace, to shorten the halts; but Chauvelin knew better than to allow
slackness and discontent to follow in the wake of over-fatigue.</p>

<p>The soldiers were always well rested and well fed, and though
the delay caused by long and frequent halts must have been just as
irksome to him as it was to Héron, yet he bore it imperturbably,
for he would have had no use on this momentous journey for a
handful of men whose enthusiasm and spirit had been blown away by
the roughness of the gale, or drowned in the fury of the constant
downpour of rain.</p>

<p>Of all this Marguerite had been conscious in a vague, dreamy
kind of way. She seemed to herself like the spectator in a moving
panoramic drama, unable to raise a finger or to do aught to stop
that final, inevitable ending, the cataclysm of sorrow and misery
that awaited her, when the dreary curtain would fall on the last
act, and she and all the other spectators&mdash;Armand, Chauvelin,
Héron, the soldiers&mdash;would slowly wend their way home, leaving
the principal actor behind the fallen curtain, which never would be
lifted again.</p>

<p>After that first halt in the guard-room of the Rue Ste. Anne she
had been bidden to enter a second hackney coach, which, followed
the other at a distance of fifty mètres or so, and was, like that
other, closely surrounded by a squad of mounted men.</p>

<p>Armand and Chauvelin rode in this carriage with her; all day she
sat looking out on the endless monotony of the road, on the drops
of rain that pattered against the window-glass, and ran down from
it like a perpetual stream of tears.</p>

<p>There were two halts called during the day&mdash;one for dinner
and one midway through the afternoon&mdash;when she and Armand
would step out of the coach and be led&mdash;always with soldiers
close around them&mdash;to some wayside inn, where some sort of a
meal was served, where the atmosphere was close and stuffy and
smelt of onion soup and of stale cheese.</p>

<p>Armand and Marguerite would in most cases have a room to
themselves, with sentinels posted outside the door, and they would
try and eat enough to keep body and soul together, for they would
not allow their strength to fall away before the end of the journey
was reached.</p>

<p>For the night halt&mdash;once at Beauvais and the second night
at Abbeville&mdash;they were escorted to a house in the interior of
the city, where they were accommodated with moderately clean
lodgings. Sentinels, however, were always at their doors; they were
prisoners in all but name, and had little or no privacy; for at
night they were both so tired that they were glad to retire
immediately, and to lie down on the hard beds that had been
provided for them, even if sleep fled from their eyes, and their
hearts and souls were flying through the city in search of him who
filled their every thought.</p>

<p>Of Percy they saw little or nothing. In the daytime food was
evidently brought to him in the carriage, for they did not see him
get down, and on those two nights at Beauvais and Abbeville, when
they caught sight of him stepping out of the coach outside the
gates of the barracks, he was so surrounded by soldiers that they
only saw the top of his head and his broad shoulders towering above
those of the men.</p>

<p>Once Marguerite had put all her pride, all her dignity by, and
asked citizen Chauvelin for news of her husband.</p>

<p>"He is well and cheerful, Lady Blakeney," he had replied with
his sarcastic smile. "Ah!" he added pleasantly, "those English are
remarkable people. We, of Gallic breed, will never really
understand them. Their fatalism is quite Oriental in its quiet
resignation to the decree of Fate. Did you know, Lady Blakeney,
that when Sir Percy was arrested he did not raise a hand. I
thought, and so did my colleague, that he would have fought like a
lion. And now, that he has no doubt realised that quiet submission
will serve him best in the end, he is as calm on this journey as I
am myself. In fact," he concluded complacently, "whenever I have
succeeded in peeping into the coach I have invariably found Sir
Percy Blakeney fast asleep."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;" she murmured, for it was so difficult to speak to
this callous wretch, who was obviously mocking her in her
misery&mdash;"he&mdash;you&mdash;you are not keeping him in
irons?"</p>

<p>"No! Oh no!" replied Chauvelin with perfect urbanity. "You see,
now that we have you, Lady Blakeney, and citizen St. Just with us
we have no reason to fear that that elusive Pimpernel will spirit
himself away."</p>

<p>A hot retort had risen to Armand's lips. The warm Latin blood in
him rebelled against this intolerable situation, the man's sneers
in the face of Marguerite's anguish. But her restraining, gentle
hand had already pressed his. What was the use of protesting, of
insulting this brute, who cared nothing for the misery which he had
caused so long as he gained his own ends?</p>

<p>And Armand held his tongue and tried to curb his temper, tried
to cultivate a little of that fatalism which Chauvelin had said was
characteristic of the English. He sat beside his sister, longing to
comfort her, yet feeling that his very presence near her was an
outrage and a sacrilege. She spoke so seldom to him, even when they
were alone, that at times the awful thought which had more than
once found birth in his weary brain became crystallised and more
real. Did Marguerite guess? Had she the slightest suspicion that
the awful cataclysm to which they were tending with every
revolution of the creaking coach-wheels had been brought about by
her brother's treacherous hand?</p>

<p>And when that thought had lodged itself quite snugly in his mind
he began to wonder whether it would not be far more simple, far
more easy, to end his miserable life in some manner that might
suggest itself on the way. When the coach crossed one of those
dilapidated, parapetless bridges, over abysses fifty mètres deep,
it might be so easy to throw open the carriage door and to take one
final jump into eternity.</p>

<p>So easy&mdash;but so damnably cowardly.</p>

<p>Marguerite's near presence quickly brought him back to himself.
His life was no longer his own to do with as he pleased; it
belonged to the chief whom he had betrayed, to the sister whom he
must endeavour to protect.</p>

<p>Of Jeanne now he thought but little. He had put even the memory
of her by&mdash;tenderly, like a sprig of lavender pressed between
the faded leaves of his own happiness. His hand was no longer fit
to hold that of any pure woman&mdash;his hand had on it a deep
stain, immutable, like the brand of Cain.</p>

<p>Yet Marguerite beside him held his hand and together they looked
out on that dreary, dreary road and listened to the patter of the
rain and the rumbling of the wheels of that other coach on
ahead&mdash;and it was all so dismal and so horrible, the rain, the
soughing of the wind in the stunted trees, this landscape of mud
and desolation, this eternally grey sky.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch44" id="ch44"></a>Chapter 44. The Halt At Crécy</h2>

<p>"Now, then, citizen, don't go to sleep; this is Crécy, our last
halt!"</p>

<p>Armand woke up from his last dream. They had been moving
steadily on since they left Abbeville soon after dawn; the rumble
of the wheels, the swaying and rocking of the carriage, the
interminable patter of the rain had lulled him into a kind of
wakeful sleep.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had already alighted from the coach. He was helping
Marguerite to descend. Armand shook the stiffness from his limbs
and followed in the wake of his sister. Always those miserable
soldiers round them, with their dank coats of rough blue cloth, and
the red caps on their heads! Armand pulled Marguerite's hand
through his arm, and dragged her with him into the house.</p>

<p>The small city lay damp and grey before them; the rough pavement
of the narrow street glistened with the wet, reflecting the dull,
leaden sky overhead; the rain beat into the puddles; the
slate-roofs shone in the cold wintry light.</p>

<p>This was Crécy! The last halt of the journey, so Chauvelin had
said. The party had drawn rein in front of a small one-storied
building that had a wooden verandah running the whole length of its
front.</p>

<p>The usual low narrow room greeted Armand and Marguerite as they
entered; the usual mildewed walls, with the colour wash flowing
away in streaks from the unsympathetic beam above; the same device,
"Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite!" scribbled in charcoal above the
black iron stove; the usual musty, close atmosphere, the usual
smell of onion and stale cheese, the usual hard straight benches
and central table with its soiled and tattered cloth.</p>

<p>Marguerite seemed dazed and giddy; she had been five hours in
that stuffy coach with nothing to distract her thoughts except the
rain-sodden landscape, on which she had ceaselessly gazed since the
early dawn.</p>

<p>Armand led her to the bench, and she sank down on it, numb and
inert, resting her elbows on the table and her head in her
hands.</p>

<p>"If it were only all over!" she sighed involuntarily. "Armand,
at times now I feel as if I were not really sane&mdash;as if my
reason had already given way! Tell me, do I seem mad to you at
times?"</p>

<p>He sat down beside her and tried to chafe her little cold
hands.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and without waiting for
permission Chauvelin entered the room.</p>

<p>"My humble apologies to you, Lady Blakeney," he said in his
usual suave manner, "but our worthy host informs me that this is
the only room in which he can serve a meal. Therefore I am forced
to intrude my presence upon you."</p>

<p>Though he spoke with outward politeness, his tone had become
more peremptory, less bland, and he did not await Marguerite's
reply before he sat down opposite to her and continued to talk
airily.</p>

<p>"An ill-conditioned fellow, our host," he said&mdash;"quite
reminds me of our friend Brogard at the Chat Gris in Calais. You
remember him, Lady Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"My sister is giddy and over-tired," interposed Armand firmly.
"I pray you, citizen, to have some regard for her."</p>

<p>"All regard in the world, citizen St. Just," protested Chauvelin
jovially. "Methought that those pleasant reminiscences would cheer
her. Ah! here comes the soup," he added, as a man in blue blouse
and breeches, with sabots on his feet, slouched into the room,
carrying a tureen which he incontinently placed upon the table. "I
feel sure that in England Lady Blakeney misses our excellent
<i>croûtes-au-pot</i>, the glory of our <i>bourgeois</i>
cookery&mdash;Lady Blakeney, a little soup?"</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Do try and eat something, little mother," Armand whispered in
her ear; "try and keep up your strength for his sake, if not for
mine."</p>

<p>She turned a wan, pale face to him, and tried to smile.</p>

<p>"I'll try, dear," she said.</p>

<p>"You have taken bread and meat to the citizens in the coach?"
Chauvelin called out to the retreating figure of mine host.</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted the latter in assent.</p>

<p>"And see that the citizen soldiers are well fed, or there will
be trouble."</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted the man again. After which he banged the door to
behind him.</p>

<p>"Citizen Héron is loath to let the prisoner out of his sight,"
explained Chauvelin lightly, "now that we have reached the last,
most important stage of our journey, so he is sharing Sir Percy's
mid-day meal in the interior of the coach."</p>

<p>He ate his soup with a relish, ostentatiously paying many small
attentions to Marguerite all the time. He ordered meat for
her&mdash;bread, butter&mdash;asked if any dainties could be got.
He was apparently in the best of tempers.</p>

<p>After he had eaten and drunk he rose and bowed ceremoniously to
her.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Lady Blakeney," he said, "but I must confer with
the prisoner now, and take from him full directions for the
continuance of our journey. After that I go to the guard-house,
which is some distance from here, right at the other end of the
city. We pick up a fresh squad here, twenty hardened troopers from
a cavalry regiment usually stationed at Abbeville. They have had
work to do in this town, which is a hot-bed of treachery. I must go
inspect the men and the sergeant who will be in command. Citizen
Héron leaves all these inspections to me; he likes to stay by his
prisoner. In the meanwhile you will be escorted back to your coach,
where I pray you to await my arrival, when we change guard first,
then proceed on our way."</p>

<p>Marguerite was longing to ask him many questions; once again she
would have smothered her pride and begged for news of her husband,
but Chauvelin did not wait. He hurried out of the room, and Armand
and Marguerite could hear him ordering the soldiers to take them
forthwith back to the coach.</p>

<p>As they came out of the inn they saw the other coach some fifty
mètres further up the street. The horses that had done duty since
leaving Abbeville had been taken out, and two soldiers in ragged
shirts, and with crimson caps set jauntily over their left ear,
were leading the two fresh horses along. The troopers were still
mounting guard round both the coaches; they would be relieved
presently.</p>

<p>Marguerite would have given ten years of her life at this moment
for the privilege of speaking to her husband, or even of seeing
him&mdash;of seeing that he was well. A quick, wild plan sprang up
in her mind that she would bribe the sergeant in command to grant
her wish while citizen Chauvelin was absent. The man had not an
unkind face, and he must be very poor&mdash;people in France were
very poor these days, though the rich had been robbed and luxurious
homes devastated ostensibly to help the poor.</p>

<p>She was about to put this sudden thought into execution when
Héron's hideous face, doubly hideous now with that bandage of
doubtful cleanliness cutting across his brow, appeared at the
carriage window.</p>

<p>He cursed violently and at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"What are those d----d aristos doing out there?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Just getting into the coach, citizen," replied the sergeant
promptly.</p>

<p>And Armand and Marguerite were immediately ordered back into the
coach.</p>

<p>Héron remained at the window for a few moments longer; he had a
toothpick in his hand which he was using very freely.</p>

<p>"How much longer are we going to wait in this cursed hole?" he
called out to the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Only a few moments longer, citizen. Citizen Chauvelin will be
back soon with the guard."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the clatter of cavalry horses on the
rough, uneven pavement drew Marguerite's attention. She lowered the
carriage window and looked out. Chauvelin had just returned with
the new escort. He was on horseback; his horse's bridle, since he
was but an indifferent horseman, was held by one of the
troopers.</p>

<p>Outside the inn he dismounted; evidently he had taken full
command of the expedition, and scarcely referred to Héron, who
spent most of his time cursing at the men or the weather when he
was not lying half-asleep and partially drunk in the inside of the
carriage.</p>

<p>The changing of the guard was now accomplished quietly and in
perfect order. The new escort consisted of twenty mounted men,
including a sergeant and a corporal, and of two drivers, one for
each coach. The <i>cortège</i> now was filed up in marching order;
ahead a small party of scouts, then the coach with Marguerite and
Armand closely surrounded by mounted men, and at a short distance
the second coach with citizen Héron and the prisoner equally well
guarded.</p>

<p>Chauvelin superintended all the arrangements himself. He spoke
for some few moments with the sergeant, also with the driver of his
own coach. He went to the window of the other carriage, probably in
order to consult with citizen Héron, or to take final directions
from the prisoner, for Marguerite, who was watching him, saw him
standing on the step and leaning well forward into the interior,
whilst apparently he was taking notes on a small tablet which he
had in his hand.</p>

<p>A small knot of idlers had congregated in the narrow street; men
in blouses and boys in ragged breeches lounged against the verandah
of the inn and gazed with inexpressive, stolid eyes on the
soldiers, the coaches, the citizen who wore the tricolour scarf.
They had seen this sort of thing before now&mdash;aristos being
conveyed to Paris under arrest, prisoners on their way to or from
Amiens. They saw Marguerite's pale face at the carriage window. It
was not the first woman's face they had seen under like
circumstances, and there was no special interest about this aristo.
They were smoking or spitting, or just lounging idly against the
balustrade. Marguerite wondered if none of them had wife, sister,
or mother, or child; if every sympathy, every kind of feeling in
these poor wretches had been atrophied by misery or by fear.</p>

<p>At last everything was in order and the small party ready to
start.</p>

<p>"Does any one here know the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, close
by the park of the Château d'Ourde?" asked Chauvelin, vaguely
addressing the knot of gaffers that stood closest to him.</p>

<p>The men shook their heads. Some had dimly heard of the Château
d'Ourde; it was some way in the interior of the forest of Boulogne,
but no one knew about a chapel; people did not trouble about
chapels nowadays. With the indifference so peculiar to local
peasantry, these men knew no more of the surrounding country than
the twelve or fifteen league circle that was within a walk of their
sleepy little town.</p>

<p>One of the scouts on ahead turned in his saddle and spoke to
citizen Chauvelin:</p>

<p>"I think I know the way pretty well; citizen Chauvelin," he
said; "at any rate, I know it as far as the forest of
Boulogne."</p>

<p>Chauvelin referred to his tablets.</p>

<p>"That's good," he said; "then when you reach the mile-stone that
stands on this road at the confine of the forest, bear sharply to
your right and skirt the wood until you see the hamlet
of&mdash;Le&mdash;something. Le&mdash;Le&mdash;yes&mdash;Le
Crocq&mdash;that's it in the valley below."</p>

<p>"I know Le Crocq, I think," said the trooper.</p>

<p>"Very well, then; at that point it seems that a wide road
strikes at right angles into the interior of the forest; you follow
that until a stone chapel with a colonnaded porch stands before you
on your left, and the walls and gates of a park on your right. That
is so, is it not, Sir Percy?" he added, once more turning towards
the interior of the coach.</p>

<p>Apparently the answer satisfied him, for he gave the quick word
of command, "<i>En avant!</i>" then turned back towards his own
coach and finally entered it.</p>

<p>"Do you know the Château d'Ourde, citizen St. Just?" he asked
abruptly as soon as the carriage began to move.</p>

<p>Armand woke&mdash;as was habitual with him these days&mdash;from
some gloomy reverie.</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen," he replied. "I know it."</p>

<p>"And the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I know it too."</p>

<p>Indeed, he knew the château well, and the little chapel in the
forest, whither the fisher-folk from Portel and Boulogne came on a
pilgrimage once a year to lay their nets on the miracle-working
relic. The chapel was disused now. Since the owner of the château
had fled no one had tended it, and the fisher-folk were afraid to
wander out, lest their superstitious faith be counted against them
by the authorities, who had abolished <i>le bon Dieu</i>.</p>

<p>But Armand had found refuge there eighteen months ago, on his
way to Calais, when Percy had risked his life in order to save
him&mdash;Armand&mdash;from death. He could have groaned aloud with
the anguish of this recollection. But Marguerite's aching nerves
had thrilled at the name.</p>

<p>The Château d'Ourde! The Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre! That was
the place which Percy had mentioned in his letter, the place where
he had given rendezvous to de Batz. Sir Andrew had said that the
Dauphin could not possibly be there, yet Percy was leading his
enemies thither, and had given the rendezvous there to de Batz. And
this despite that whatever plans, whatever hopes, had been born in
his mind when he was still immured in the Conciergerie prison must
have been set at naught by the clever counter plot of Chauvelin and
Héron.</p>

<p>"At the merest suspicion that you have played us false, at a
hint that you have led us into an ambush, or if merely our hopes of
finding Capet at the end of the journey are frustrated, the lives
of your wife and of your friend are forfeit to us, and they will
both be shot before your eyes."</p>

<p>With these words, with this precaution, those cunning fiends had
effectually not only tied the schemer's hands, but forced him
either to deliver the child to them or to sacrifice his wife and
his friend.</p>

<p>The <i>impasse</i> was so horrible that she could not face it
even in her thoughts. A strange, fever-like heat coursed through
her veins, yet left her hands icy-cold; she longed for, yet
dreaded, the end of the journey&mdash;that awful grappling with the
certainty of coming death. Perhaps, after all, Percy, too, had
given up all hope. Long ago he had consecrated his life to the
attainment of his own ideals; and there was a vein of fatalism in
him; perhaps he had resigned himself to the inevitable, and his
only desire now was to give up his life, as he had said, in the
open, beneath God's sky, to draw his last breath with the
storm-clouds tossed through infinity above him, and the murmur of
the wind in the trees to sing him to rest.</p>

<p>Crécy was gradually fading into the distance, wrapped in a
mantle of damp and mist. For a long while Marguerite could see the
sloping slate roofs glimmering like steel in the grey afternoon
light, and the quaint church tower with its beautiful lantern,
through the pierced stonework of which shone patches of the leaden
sky.</p>

<p>Then a sudden twist of the road hid the city from view; only the
outlying churchyard remained in sight, with its white monuments and
granite crosses, over which the dark yews, wet with the rain and
shaken by the gale, sent showers of diamond-like sprays.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch45" id="ch45"></a>Chapter 45. The Forest Of
Boulogne</h2>

<p>Progress was not easy, and very slow along the muddy road; the
two coaches moved along laboriously, with wheels creaking and
sinking deeply from time to time in the quagmire.</p>

<p>When the small party finally reached the edge of the wood the
greyish light of this dismal day had changed in the west to a dull
reddish glow&mdash;a glow that had neither brilliance nor
incandescence in it; only a weird tint that hung over the horizon
and turned the distance into lines of purple.</p>

<p>The nearness of the sea made itself already felt; there was a
briny taste in the damp atmosphere, and the trees all turned their
branches away in the same direction against the onslaught of the
prevailing winds.</p>

<p>The road at this point formed a sharp fork, skirting the wood on
either side, the forest lying like a black close mass of spruce and
firs on the left, while the open expanse of country stretched out
on the right. The south-westerly gale struck with full violence
against the barrier of forest trees, bending the tall crests of the
pines and causing their small dead branches to break and fall with
a sharp, crisp sound like a cry of pain.</p>

<p>The squad had been fresh at starting; now the men had been four
hours in the saddle under persistent rain and gusty wind; they were
tired, and the atmosphere of the close, black forest so near the
road was weighing upon their spirits.</p>

<p>Strange sounds came to them from out the dense network of
trees&mdash;the screeching of night-birds, the weird call of the
owls, the swift and furtive tread of wild beasts on the prowl. The
cold winter and lack of food had lured the wolves from their
fastnesses&mdash;hunger had emboldened them, and now, as gradually
the grey light fled from the sky, dismal howls could be heard in
the distance, and now and then a pair of eyes, bright with the
reflection of the lurid western glow, would shine momentarily out
of the darkness like tiny glow-worms, and as quickly vanish
away.</p>

<p>The men shivered&mdash;more with vague superstitious fear than
with cold. They would have urged their horses on, but the wheels of
the coaches stuck persistently in the mud, and now and again a halt
had to be called so that the spokes and axles might be cleared.</p>

<p>They rode on in silence. No one had a mind to speak, and the
mournful soughing of the wind in the pine-trees seemed to check the
words on every lip. The dull thud of hoofs in the soft road, the
clang of steel bits and buckles, the snorting of the horses alone
answered the wind, and also the monotonous creaking of the wheels
ploughing through the ruts.</p>

<p>Soon the ruddy glow in the west faded into soft-toned purple and
then into grey; finally that too vanished. Darkness was drawing in
on every side like a wide, black mantle pulled together closer and
closer overhead by invisible giant hands.</p>

<p>The rain still fell in a thin drizzle that soaked through caps
and coats, made the bridles slimy and the saddles slippery and
damp. A veil of vapour hung over the horses' cruppers, and was
rendered fuller and thicker every moment with the breath that came
from their nostrils. The wind no longer blew with gusty
fury&mdash;its strength seemed to have been spent with the grey
light of day&mdash;but now and then it would still come sweeping
across the open country, and dash itself upon the wall of forest
trees, lashing against the horses' ears, catching the corner of a
mantle here, an ill-adjusted cap there, and wreaking its
mischievous freak for a while, then with a sigh of satisfaction
die, murmuring among the pines.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a halt, much shouting, a volley of oaths from
the drivers, and citizen Chauvelin thrust his head out of the
carriage window.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The scouts, citizen," replied the sergeant, who had been riding
close to the coach door all this while; "they have returned."</p>

<p>"Tell one man to come straight to me and report."</p>

<p>Marguerite sat quite still. Indeed, she had almost ceased to
live momentarily, for her spirit was absent from her body, which
felt neither fatigue, nor cold, nor pain. But she heard the
snorting of the horse close by as its rider pulled him up sharply
beside the carriage door.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Chauvelin curtly.</p>

<p>"This is the cross-road, citizen," replied the man; "it strikes
straight into the wood, and the hamlet of Le Crocq lies down in the
valley on the right."</p>

<p>"Did you follow the road in the wood?"</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen. About two leagues from here there is a clearing
with a small stone chapel, more like a large shrine, nestling among
the trees. Opposite to it the angle of a high wall with large
wrought-iron gates at the corner, and from these a wide drive leads
through a park."</p>

<p>"Did you turn into the drive?"</p>

<p>"Only a little way, citizen. We thought we had best report first
that all is safe."</p>

<p>"You saw no one?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"The château, then, lies some distance from the gates?"</p>

<p>"A league or more, citizen. Close to the gates there are
outhouses and stabling, the disused buildings of the home farm, I
should say."</p>

<p>"Good! We are on the right road, that is clear. Keep ahead with
your men now, but only some two hundred mètres or so. Stay!" he
added, as if on second thoughts. "Ride down to the other coach and
ask the prisoner if we are on the right track."</p>

<p>The rider turned his horse sharply round. Marguerite heard the
clang of metal and the sound of retreating hoofs.</p>

<p>A few moments later the man returned.</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen," he reported, "the prisoner says it is quite
right. The Château d'Ourde lies a full league from its gates. This
is the nearest road to the chapel and the château. He says we
should reach the former in half an hour. It will be very dark in
there," he added with a significant nod in the direction of the
wood.</p>

<p>Chauvelin made no reply, but quietly stepped out of the coach.
Marguerite watched him, leaning out of the window, following his
small trim figure as he pushed his way past the groups of mounted
men, catching at a horse's bit now and then, or at a bridle, making
a way for himself amongst the restless, champing animals, without
the slightest hesitation or fear.</p>

<p>Soon his retreating figure lost its sharp outline silhouetted
against the evening sky. It was enfolded in the veil of vapour
which was blown out of the horses' nostrils or rising from their
damp cruppers; it became more vague, almost ghost-like, through the
mist and the fast-gathering gloom.</p>

<p>Presently a group of troopers hid him entirely from her view,
but she could hear his thin, smooth voice quite clearly as he
called to citizen Héron.</p>

<p>"We are close to the end of our journey now, citizen," she heard
him say. "If the prisoner has not played us false little Capet
should be in our charge within the hour."</p>

<p>A growl not unlike those that came from out the mysterious
depths of the forest answered him.</p>

<p>"If he is not," and Marguerite recognised the harsh tones of
citizen Héron&mdash;"if he is not, then two corpses will be rotting
in this wood tomorrow for the wolves to feed on, and the prisoner
will be on his way back to Paris with me."</p>

<p>Some one laughed. It might have been one of the troopers, more
callous than his comrades, but to Marguerite the laugh had a
strange, familiar ring in it, the echo of something long since past
and gone.</p>

<p>Then Chauvelin's voice once more came clearly to her ear:</p>

<p>"My suggestion, citizen," he was saying, "is that the prisoner
shall now give me an order&mdash;couched in whatever terms he may
think necessary&mdash;but a distinct order to his friends to give
up Capet to me without any resistance. I could then take some of
the men with me, and ride as quickly as the light will allow up to
the château, and take possession of it, of Capet, and of those who
are with him. We could get along faster thus. One man can give up
his horse to me and continue the journey on the box of your coach.
The two carriages could then follow at foot pace. But I fear that
if we stick together complete darkness will overtake us and we
might find ourselves obliged to pass a very uncomfortable night in
this wood."</p>

<p>"I won't spend another night in this suspense&mdash;it would
kill me," growled Héron to the accompaniment of one of his choicest
oaths. "You must do as you think right&mdash;you planned the whole
of this affair&mdash;see to it that it works out well in the
end."</p>

<p>"How many men shall I take with me? Our advance guard is here,
of course."</p>

<p>"I couldn't spare you more than four more men&mdash;I shall want
the others to guard the prisoners."</p>

<p>"Four men will be quite sufficient, with the four of the advance
guard. That will leave you twelve men for guarding your prisoners,
and you really only need to guard the woman&mdash;her life will
answer for the others."</p>

<p>He had raised his voice when he said this, obviously intending
that Marguerite and Armand should hear.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go ahead," he continued, apparently in answer to an
assent from his colleague. "Sir Percy, will you be so kind as to
scribble the necessary words on these tablets?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause, during which Marguerite heard plainly
the long and dismal cry of a night bird that, mayhap, was seeking
its mate. Then Chauvelin's voice was raised again.</p>

<p>"I thank you," he said; "this certainly should be quite
effectual. And now, citizen Héron, I do not think that under the
circumstances we need fear an ambuscade or any kind of
trickery&mdash;you hold the hostages. And if by any chance I and my
men are attacked, or if we encounter armed resistance at the
château, I will despatch a rider back straightway to you,
and&mdash;well, you will know what to do."</p>

<p>His voice died away, merged in the soughing of the wind, drowned
by the clang of metal, of horses snorting, of men living and
breathing. Marguerite felt that beside her Armand had shuddered,
and that in the darkness his trembling hand had sought and found
hers.</p>

<p>She leaned well out of the window, trying to see. The gloom had
gathered more closely in, and round her the veil of vapour from the
horses' steaming cruppers hung heavily in the misty air. In front
of her the straight lines of a few fir trees stood out dense and
black against the greyness beyond, and between these lines purple
tints of various tones and shades mingled one with the other,
merging the horizon line with the sky. Here and there a more solid
black patch indicated the tiny houses of the hamlet of Le Crocq far
down in the valley below; from some of these houses small lights
began to glimmer like blinking yellow eyes. Marguerite's gaze,
however, did not rest on the distant landscape&mdash;it tried to
pierce the gloom that hid her immediate surroundings; the mounted
men were all round the coach&mdash;more closely round her than the
trees in the forest. But the horses were restless, moving all the
time, and as they moved she caught glimpses of that other coach and
of Chauvelin's ghostlike figure, walking rapidly through the mist.
Just for one brief moment she saw the other coach, and Héron's head
and shoulders leaning out of the window. His sugar-loaf hat was on
his head, and the bandage across his brow looked like a sharp, pale
streak below it.</p>

<p>"Do not doubt it, citizen Chauvelin," he called out loudly in
his harsh, raucous voice, "I shall know what to do; the wolves will
have their meal to-night, and the guillotine will not be cheated
either."</p>

<p>Armand put his arm round his sister's shoulders and gently drew
her back into the carriage.</p>

<p>"Little mother," he said, "if you can think of a way whereby my
life would redeem Percy's and yours, show me that way now."</p>

<p>But she replied quietly and firmly:</p>

<p>"There is no way, Armand. If there is, it is in the hands of
God."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch46" id="ch46"></a>Chapter 46. Others In The
Park</h2>

<p>Chauvelin and his picked escort had in the meanwhile detached
themselves from the main body of the squad. Soon the dull thud of
their horses' hoofs treading the soft ground came more
softly&mdash;then more softly still as they turned into the wood,
and the purple shadows seemed to enfold every sound and finally to
swallow them completely.</p>

<p>Armand and Marguerite from the depth of the carriage heard
Héron's voice ordering his own driver now to take the lead. They
sat quite still and watched, and presently the other coach passed
them slowly on the road, its silhouette standing out ghostly and
grim for a moment against the indigo tones of the distant
country.</p>

<p>Héron's head, with its battered sugar-loaf hat, and the soiled
bandage round the brow, was as usual out of the carriage window. He
leered across at Marguerite when he saw the outline of her face
framed by the window of the carriage.</p>

<p>"Say all the prayers you have ever known, citizeness," he said
with a loud laugh, "that my friend Chauvelin may find Capet at the
château, or else you may take a last look at the open country, for
you will not see the sun rise on it to-morrow. It is one or the
other, you know."</p>

<p>She tried not to look at him; the very sight of him filled her
with horror&mdash;that blotched, gaunt face of his, the fleshy
lips, that hideous bandage across his face that hid one of his
eyes! She tried not to see him and not to hear him laugh.</p>

<p>Obviously he too laboured under the stress of great excitement.
So far everything had gone well; the prisoner had made no attempt
at escape, and apparently did not mean to play a double game. But
the crucial hour had come, and with it darkness and the mysterious
depths of the forest with their weird sounds and sudden flashes of
ghostly lights. They naturally wrought on the nerves of men like
Héron, whose conscience might have been dormant, but whose ears
were nevertheless filled with the cries of innocent victims
sacrificed to their own lustful ambitions and their blind,
unreasoning hates.</p>

<p>He gave sharp orders to the men to close up round the carriages,
and then gave the curt word of command:</p>

<p>"<i>En avant!</i>"</p>

<p>Marguerite could but strain her ears to listen. All her senses,
all her faculties had merged into that of hearing, rendering it
doubly keen. It seemed to her that she could distinguish the faint
sound&mdash;that even as she listened grew fainter and fainter
yet&mdash;of Chauvelin and his squad moving away rapidly into the
thickness of the wood some distance already ahead.</p>

<p>Close to her there was the snorting of horses, the clanging and
noise of moving mounted men. Héron's coach had taken the lead; she
could hear the creaking of its wheels, the calls of the driver
urging his beasts.</p>

<p>The diminished party was moving at foot-pace in the darkness
that seemed to grow denser at every step, and through that silence
which was so full of mysterious sounds.</p>

<p>The carriage rolled and rocked on its springs; Marguerite, giddy
and overtired, lay back with closed eyes, her hand resting in that
of Armand. Time, space and distance had ceased to be; only Death,
the great Lord of all, had remained; he walked on ahead, scythe on
skeleton shoulder, and beckoned patiently, but with a sure, grim
hand.</p>

<p>There was another halt, the coach-wheels groaned and creaked on
their axles, one or two horses reared with the sudden drawing up of
the curb.</p>

<p>"What is it now?" came Héron's hoarse voice through the
darkness.</p>

<p>"It is pitch-dark, citizen," was the response from ahead. "The
drivers cannot see their horses' ears. They wait to know if they
may light their lanthorns and then lead their horses."</p>

<p>"They can lead their horses," replied Héron roughly, "but I'll
have no lanthorns lighted. We don't know what fools may be lurking
behind trees, hoping to put a bullet through my head&mdash;or
yours, sergeant&mdash;we don't want to make a lighted target of
ourselves&mdash;what? But let the drivers lead their horses, and
one or two of you who are riding greys might dismount too and lead
the way&mdash;the greys would show up perhaps in this cursed
blackness."</p>

<p>While his orders were being carried out, he called out once
more:</p>

<p>"Are we far now from that confounded chapel?"</p>

<p>"We can't be far, citizen; the whole forest is not more than six
leagues wide at any point, and we have gone two since we turned
into it."</p>

<p>"Hush!" Héron's voice suddenly broke in hoarsely. "What was
that? Silence, I say. Damn you&mdash;can't you hear?"</p>

<p>There was a hush&mdash;every ear straining to listen; but the
horses were not still&mdash;they continued to champ their bits, to
paw the ground, and to toss their heads, impatient to get on. Only
now and again there would come a lull even through these
sounds&mdash;a second or two, mayhap, of perfect, unbroken
silence&mdash;and then it seemed as if right through the darkness a
mysterious echo sent back those same sounds&mdash;the champing of
bits, the pawing of soft ground, the tossing and snorting of
animals, human life that breathed far out there among the
trees.</p>

<p>"It is citizen Chauvelin and his men," said the sergeant after a
while, and speaking in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Silence&mdash;I want to hear," came the curt,
hoarsely-whispered command.</p>

<p>Once more every one listened, the men hardly daring to breathe,
clinging to their bridles and pulling on their horses' mouths,
trying to keep them still, and again through the night there came
like a faint echo which seemed to throw back those sounds that
indicated the presence of men and of horses not very far away.</p>

<p>"Yes, it must be citizen Chauvelin," said Héron at last; but the
tone of his voice sounded as if he were anxious and only half
convinced; "but I thought he would be at the château by now."</p>

<p>"He may have had to go at foot-pace; it is very dark, citizen
Héron," remarked the sergeant.</p>

<p>"<i>En avant</i>, then," quoth the other; "the sooner we come up
with him the better."</p>

<p>And the squad of mounted men, the two coaches, the drivers and
the advance section who were leading their horses slowly restarted
on the way. The horses snorted, the bits and stirrups clanged, and
the springs and wheels of the coaches creaked and groaned dismally
as the ramshackle vehicles began once more to plough the carpet of
pine-needles that lay thick upon the road.</p>

<p>But inside the carriage Armand and Marguerite held one another
tightly by the hand.</p>

<p>"It is de Batz&mdash;with his friends," she whispered scarce
above her breath.</p>

<p>"De Batz?" he asked vaguely and fearfully, for in the dark he
could not see her face, and as he did not understand why she should
suddenly be talking of de Batz he thought with horror that mayhap
her prophecy anent herself had come true, and that her mind wearied
and over-wrought&mdash;had become suddenly unhinged.</p>

<p>"Yes, de Batz," she replied. "Percy sent him a message, through
me, to meet him&mdash;here. I am not mad, Armand," she added more
calmly. "Sir Andrew took Percy's letter to de Batz the day that we
started from Paris."</p>

<p>"Great God!" exclaimed Armand, and instinctively, with a sense
of protection, he put his arms round his sister. "Then, if
Chauvelin or the squad is attacked&mdash;if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said calmly; "if de Batz makes an attack on
Chauvelin, or if he reaches the château first and tries to defend
it, they will shoot us...Armand, and Percy."</p>

<p>"But is the Dauphin at the Château d'Ourde?"</p>

<p>"No, no! I think not."</p>

<p>"Then why should Percy have invoked the aid of de Batz? Now,
when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she murmured helplessly. "Of course, when he
wrote the letter he could not guess that they would hold us as
hostages. He may have thought that under cover of darkness and of
an unexpected attack he might have saved himself had he been alone;
but now&mdash;now that you and I are here&mdash;Oh! it is all so
horrible, and I cannot understand it all."</p>

<p>"Hark!" broke in Armand, suddenly gripping her arm more
tightly.</p>

<p>"Halt!" rang the sergeant's voice through the night.</p>

<p>This time there was no mistaking the sound; already it came from
no far distance. It was the sound of a man running and panting, and
now and again calling out as he ran.</p>

<p>For a moment there was stillness in the very air, the wind
itself was hushed between two gusts, even the rain had ceased its
incessant pattering. Héron's harsh voice was raised in the
stillness.</p>

<p>"What is it now?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"A runner, citizen," replied the sergeant, "coming through the
wood from the right."</p>

<p>"From the right?" and the exclamation was accompanied by a
volley of oaths; "the direction of the château? Chauvelin has been
attacked; he is sending a messenger back to me.
Sergeant&mdash;sergeant, close up round that coach; guard your
prisoners as you value your life, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest of his words were drowned in a yell of such violent
fury that the horses, already over-nervous and fidgety, reared in
mad terror, and the men had the greatest difficulty in holding them
in. For a few minutes noisy confusion prevailed, until the men
could quieten their quivering animals with soft words and gentle
pattings.</p>

<p>Then the troopers obeyed, closing up round the coach wherein
brother and sister sat huddled against one another.</p>

<p>One of the men said under his breath:</p>

<p>"Ah! but the citizen agent knows how to curse! One day he will
break his gullet with the fury of his oaths."</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the runner had come nearer, always at the same
breathless speed.</p>

<p>The next moment he was challenged:</p>

<p>"<i>Qui va là?</i>"</p>

<p>"A friend!" he replied, panting and exhausted. "Where is citizen
Héron?"</p>

<p>"Here!" came the reply in a voice hoarse with passionate
excitement. "Come up, damn you. Be quick!"</p>

<p>"A lanthorn, citizen," suggested one of the drivers.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;not now. Here! Where the devil are we?"</p>

<p>"We are close to the chapel on our left, citizen," said the
sergeant.</p>

<p>The runner, whose eyes were no doubt accustomed to the gloom,
had drawn nearer to the carriage.</p>

<p>"The gates of the château," he said, still somewhat
breathlessly, "are just opposite here on the right, citizen. I have
just come through them."</p>

<p>"Speak up, man!" and Héron's voice now sounded as if choked with
passion. "Citizen Chauvelin sent you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He bade me tell you that he has gained access to the
château, and that Capet is not there."</p>

<p>A series of citizen Héron's choicest oaths interrupted the man's
speech. Then he was curtly ordered to proceed, and he resumed his
report.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin rang at the door of the château; after a
while he was admitted by an old servant, who appeared to be in
charge, but the place seemed otherwise absolutely
deserted&mdash;only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what? Go on; what is it?"</p>

<p>"As we rode through the park it seemed to us as if we were being
watched, and followed. We heard distinctly the sound of horses
behind and around us, but we could see nothing; and now, when I ran
back, again I heard. There are others in the park to-night besides
us, citizen."</p>

<p>There was silence after that. It seemed as if the flood of
Héron's blasphemous eloquence had spent itself at last.</p>

<p>"Others in the park!" And now his voice was scarcely above a
whisper, hoarse and trembling. "How many? Could you see?"</p>

<p>"No, citizen, we could not see; but there are horsemen lurking
round the château now. Citizen Chauvelin took four men into the
house with him and left the others on guard outside. He bade me
tell you that it might be safer to send him a few more men if you
could spare them. There are a number of disused farm buildings
quite close to the gates, and he suggested that all the horses be
put up there for the night, and that the men come up to the château
on foot; it would be quicker and safer, for the darkness is
intense."</p>

<p>Even while the man spoke the forest in the distance seemed to
wake from its solemn silence, the wind on its wings brought sounds
of life and movement different from the prowling of beasts or the
screeching of night-birds. It was the furtive advance of men, the
quick whispers of command, of encouragement, of the human animal
preparing to attack his kind. But all in the distance still, all
muffled, all furtive as yet.</p>

<p>"Sergeant!" It was Héron's voice, but it too was subdued, and
almost calm now; "can you see the chapel?"</p>

<p>"More clearly, citizen," replied the sergeant. "It is on our
left; quite a small building, I think."</p>

<p>"Then dismount, and walk all round it. See that there are no
windows or door in the rear."</p>

<p>There was a prolonged silence, during which those distant sounds
of men moving, of furtive preparations for attack, struck
distinctly through the night.</p>

<p>Marguerite and Armand, clinging to one another, not knowing what
to think, nor yet what to fear, heard the sounds mingling with
those immediately round them, and Marguerite murmured under her
breath:</p>

<p>"It is de Batz and some of his friends; but what can they do?
What can Percy hope for now?"</p>

<p>But of Percy she could hear and see nothing. The darkness and
the silence had drawn their impenetrable veil between his unseen
presence and her own consciousness. She could see the coach in
which he was, but Héron's hideous personality, his head with its
battered hat and soiled bandage, had seemed to obtrude itself
always before her gaze, blotting out from her mind even the
knowledge that Percy was there not fifty yards away from her.</p>

<p>So strong did this feeling grow in her that presently the awful
dread seized upon her that he was no longer there; that he was
dead, worn out with fatigue and illness brought on by terrible
privations, or if not dead that he had swooned, that he was
unconscious&mdash;his spirit absent from his body. She remembered
that frightful yell of rage and hate which Héron had uttered a few
minutes ago. Had the brute vented his fury on his helpless,
weakened prisoner, and stilled forever those lips that, mayhap, had
mocked him to the last?</p>

<p>Marguerite could not guess. She hardly knew what to hope.
Vaguely, when the thought of Percy lying dead beside his enemy
floated through her aching brain, she was almost conscious of a
sense of relief at the thought that at least he would be spared the
pain of the final, inevitable cataclysm.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch47" id="ch47"></a>Chapter 47. The Chapel Of The Holy
Sepulchre</h2>

<p>The sergeant's voice broke in upon her misery.</p>

<p>The man had apparently done as the citizen agent had ordered,
and had closely examined the little building that stood on the
left&mdash;a vague, black mass more dense than the surrounding
gloom.</p>

<p>"It is all solid stone, citizen," he said; "iron gates in front,
closed but not locked, rusty key in the lock, which turns quite
easily; no windows or door in the rear."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite certain, citizen; it is plain, solid stone at the back,
and the only possible access to the interior is through the iron
gate in front."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>Marguerite could only just hear Héron speaking to the sergeant.
Darkness enveloped every form and deadened every sound. Even the
harsh voice which she had learned to loathe and to dread sounded
curiously subdued and unfamiliar. Héron no longer seemed inclined
to storm, to rage, or to curse. The momentary danger, the thought
of failure, the hope of revenge, had apparently cooled his temper,
strengthened his determination, and forced his voice down to a
little above a whisper. He gave his orders clearly and firmly, and
the words came to Marguerite on the wings of the wind with strange
distinctness, borne to her ears by the darkness itself, and the
hush that lay over the wood.</p>

<p>"Take half a dozen men with you, sergeant," she heard him say,
"and join citizen Chauvelin at the chateau. You can stable your
horses in the farm buildings close by, as he suggests and run to
him on foot. You and your men should quickly get the best of a
handful of midnight prowlers; you are well armed and they only
civilians. Tell citizen Chauvelin that I in the meanwhile will take
care of our prisoners. The Englishman I shall put in irons and lock
up inside the chapel, with five men under the command of your
corporal to guard him, the other two I will drive myself straight
to Crécy with what is left of the escort. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen."</p>

<p>"We may not reach Crécy until two hours after midnight, but
directly I arrive I will send citizen Chauvelin further
reinforcements, which, however, I hope may not prove necessary, but
which will reach him in the early morning. Even if he is seriously
attacked, he can, with fourteen men he will have with him, hold out
inside the castle through the night. Tell him also that at dawn two
prisoners who will be with me will be shot in the courtyard of the
guard-house at Crécy, but that whether he has got hold of Capet or
not he had best pick up the Englishman in the chapel in the morning
and bring him straight to Crécy, where I shall be awaiting him
ready to return to Paris. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen."</p>

<p>"Then repeat what I said."</p>

<p>"I am to take six men with me to reinforce citizen Chauvelin
now."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you, citizen, will drive straight back to Crécy, and will
send us further reinforcements from there, which will reach us in
the early morning."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We are to hold the château against those unknown marauders if
necessary until the reinforcements come from Crécy. Having routed
them, we return here, pick up the Englishman whom you will have
locked up in the chapel under a strong guard commanded by Corporal
Cassard, and join you forthwith at Crécy."</p>

<p>"This, whether citizen Chauvelin has got hold of Capet or
not."</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen, I understand," concluded the sergeant
imperturbably; "and I am also to tell citizen Chauvelin that the
two prisoners will be shot at dawn in the courtyard of the
guard-house at Crécy."</p>

<p>"Yes. That is all. Try to find the leader of the attacking
party, and bring him along to Crécy with the Englishman; but unless
they are in very small numbers do not trouble about the others. Now
<i>en avant</i>; citizen Chauvelin might be glad of your help.
And&mdash;stay&mdash;order all the men to dismount, and take the
horses out of one of the coaches, then let the men you are taking
with you each lead a horse, or even two, and stable them all in the
farm buildings. I shall not need them, and could not spare any of
my men for the work later on. Remember that, above all, silence is
the order. When you are ready to start, come back to me here."</p>

<p>The sergeant moved away, and Marguerite heard him transmitting
the citizen agent's orders to the soldiers. The dismounting was
carried on in wonderful silence&mdash;for silence had been one of
the principal commands&mdash;only one or two words reached her
ears.</p>

<p>"First section and first half of second section fall in, right
wheel. First section each take two horses on the lead. Quietly now
there; don't tug at his bridle&mdash;let him go."</p>

<p>And after that a simple report:</p>

<p>"All ready, citizen!"</p>

<p>"Good!" was the response. "Now detail your corporal and two men
to come here to me, so that we may put the Englishman in irons, and
take him at once to the chapel, and four men to stand guard at the
doors of the other coach."</p>

<p>The necessary orders were given, and after that there came the
curt command:</p>

<p>"<i>En avant!</i>"</p>

<p>The sergeant, with his squad and all the horses, was slowly
moving away in the night. The horses' hoofs hardly made a noise on
the soft carpet of pine-needles and of dead fallen leaves, but the
champing of the bits was of course audible, and now and then the
snorting of some poor, tired horse longing for its stable.</p>

<p>Somehow in Marguerite's fevered mind this departure of a squad
of men seemed like the final flitting of her last hope; the slow
agony of the familiar sounds, the retreating horses and soldiers
moving away amongst the shadows, took on a weird significance.
Héron had given his last orders. Percy, helpless and probably
unconscious, would spend the night in that dank chapel, while she
and Armand would be taken back to Crécy, driven to death like some
insentient animals to the slaughter.</p>

<p>When the grey dawn would first begin to peep through the
branches of the pines Percy would be led back to Paris and the
guillotine, and she and Armand will have been sacrificed to the
hatred and revenge of brutes.</p>

<p>The end had come, and there was nothing more to be done.
Struggling, fighting, scheming, could be of no avail now; but she
wanted to get to her husband; she wanted to be near him now that
death was so imminent both for him and for her.</p>

<p>She tried to envisage it all, quite calmly, just as she knew
that Percy would wish her to do. The inevitable end was there, and
she would not give to these callous wretches here the gratuitous
spectacle of a despairing woman fighting blindly against adverse
Fate.</p>

<p>But she wanted to go to her husband. She felt that she could
face death more easily on the morrow if she could but see him once,
if she could but look once more into the eyes that had mirrored so
much enthusiasm, such absolute vitality and whole-hearted
self-sacrifice, and such an intensity of love and passion; if she
could but kiss once more those lips that had smiled through life,
and would smile, she knew, even in the face of death.</p>

<p>She tried to open the carriage door, but it was held from
without, and a harsh voice cursed her, ordering her to sit
still.</p>

<p>But she could lean out of the window and strain her eyes to see.
They were by now accustomed to the gloom, the dilated pupils taking
in pictures of vague forms moving like ghouls in the shadows. The
other coach was not far, and she could hear Héron's voice, still
subdued and calm, and the curses of the men. But not a sound from
Percy.</p>

<p>"I think the prisoner is unconscious," she heard one of the men
say.</p>

<p>"Lift him out of the carriage, then," was Héron's curt command;
"and you go and throw open the chapel gates."</p>

<p>Marguerite saw it all. The movement, the crowd of men, two
vague, black forms lifting another one, which appeared heavy and
inert, out of the coach, and carrying it staggering up towards the
chapel.</p>

<p>Then the forms disappeared, swallowed up by the more dense mass
of the little building, merged in with it, immovable as the stone
itself.</p>

<p>Only a few words reached her now.</p>

<p>"He is unconscious."</p>

<p>"Leave him there, then; he'll not move!"</p>

<p>"Now close the gates!"</p>

<p>There was a loud clang, and Marguerite gave a piercing scream.
She tore at the handle of the carriage door.</p>

<p>"Armand, Armand, go to him!" she cried; and all her
self-control, all her enforced calm, vanished in an outburst of
wild, agonising passion. "Let me get to him, Armand! This is the
end; get me to him, in the name of God!"</p>

<p>"Stop that woman screaming," came Héron's voice clearly through
the night. "Put her and the other prisoner in
irons&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>But while Marguerite expended her feeble strength in a mad,
pathetic effort to reach her husband, even now at this last hour,
when all hope was dead and Death was so nigh, Armand had already
wrenched the carriage door from the grasp of the soldier who was
guarding it. He was of the South, and knew the trick of charging an
unsuspecting adversary with head thrust forward like a bull inside
a ring. Thus he knocked one of the soldiers down and made a quick
rush for the chapel gates.</p>

<p>The men, attacked so suddenly and in such complete darkness, did
not wait for orders. They closed in round Armand; one man drew his
sabre and hacked away with it in aimless rage.</p>

<p>But for the moment he evaded them all, pushing his way through
them, not heeding the blows that came on him from out the darkness.
At last he reached the chapel. With one bound he was at the gate,
his numb fingers fumbling for the lock, which he could not see.</p>

<p>It was a vigorous blow from Héron's fist that brought him at
last to his knees, and even then his hands did not relax their
hold; they gripped the ornamental scroll of the gate, shook the
gate itself in its rusty hinges, pushed and pulled with the
unreasoning strength of despair. He had a sabre cut across his
brow, and the blood flowed in a warm, trickling stream down his
face. But of this he was unconscious; all that he wanted, all that
he was striving for with agonising heart-beats and cracking sinews,
was to get to his friend, who was lying in there unconscious,
abandoned&mdash;dead, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Curse you," struck Héron's voice close to his ear. "Cannot some
of you stop this raving maniac?"</p>

<p>Then it was that the heavy blow on his head caused him a
sensation of sickness, and he fell on his knees, still gripping the
ironwork.</p>

<p>Stronger hands than his were forcing him to loosen his hold;
blows that hurt terribly rained on his numbed fingers; he felt
himself dragged away, carried like an inert mass further and
further from that gate which he would have given his lifeblood to
force open.</p>

<p>And Marguerite heard all this from the inside of the coach where
she was imprisoned as effectually as was Percy's unconscious body
inside that dark chapel. She could hear the noise and scramble, and
Héron's hoarse commands, the swift sabre strokes as they cut
through the air.</p>

<p>Already a trooper had clapped irons on her wrists, two others
held the carriage doors. Now Armand was lifted back into the coach,
and she could not even help to make him comfortable, though as he
was lifted in she heard him feebly moaning. Then the carriage doors
were banged to again.</p>

<p>"Do not allow either of the prisoners out again, on peril of
your lives!" came with a vigorous curse from Héron.</p>

<p>After which there was a moment's silence; whispered commands
came spasmodically in deadened sound to her ear.</p>

<p>"Will the key turn?"</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen."</p>

<p>"All secure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, citizen. The prisoner is groaning."</p>

<p>"Let him groan."</p>

<p>"The empty coach, citizen? The horses have been taken out."</p>

<p>"Leave it standing where it is, then; citizen Chauvelin will
need it in the morning."</p>

<p>"Armand," whispered Marguerite inside the coach, "did you see
Percy?"</p>

<p>"It was so dark," murmured Armand feebly; "but I saw him, just
inside the gates, where they had laid him down. I heard him
groaning. Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear!" she said. "We can do nothing more, only die, as he
lived, bravely and with a smile on our lips, in memory of him."</p>

<p>"Number 35 is wounded, citizen," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"Curse the fool who did the mischief," was the placid response.
"Leave him here with the guard."</p>

<p>"How many of you are there left, then?" asked the same voice a
moment later.</p>

<p>"Only two, citizen; if one whole section remains with me at the
chapel door, and also the wounded man."</p>

<p>"Two are enough for me, and five are not too many at the chapel
door." And Héron's coarse, cruel laugh echoed against the stone
walls of the little chapel. "Now then, one of you get into the
coach, and the other go to the horses' heads; and remember,
Corporal Cassard, that you and your men who stay here to guard that
chapel door are answerable to the whole nation with your lives for
the safety of the Englishman."</p>

<p>The carriage door was thrown open, and a soldier stepped in and
sat down opposite Marguerite and Armand. Héron in the meanwhile was
apparently scrambling up the box. Marguerite could hear him
muttering curses as he groped for the reins, and finally gathered
them into his hand.</p>

<p>The springs of the coach creaked and groaned as the vehicle
slowly swung round; the wheels ploughed deeply through the soft
carpet of dead leaves.</p>

<p>Marguerite felt Armand's inert body leaning heavily against her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Are you in pain, dear?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>He made no reply, and she thought that he had fainted. It was
better so; at least the next dreary hours would flit by for him in
the blissful state of unconsciousness. Now at last the heavy
carriage began to move more evenly. The soldier at the horses'
heads was stepping along at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>Marguerite would have given much even now to look back once more
at the dense black mass, blacker and denser than any shadow that
had ever descended before on God's earth, which held between its
cold, cruel walls all that she loved in the world.</p>

<p>But her wrists were fettered by the irons, which cut into her
flesh when she moved. She could no longer lean out of the window,
and she could not even hear. The whole forest was hushed, the wind
was lulled to rest; wild beasts and night-birds were silent and
still. And the wheels of the coach creaked in the ruts, bearing
Marguerite with every turn further and further away from the man
who lay helpless in the chapel of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch48" id="ch48"></a>Chapter 48. The Waning Moon</h2>

<p>Armand had wakened from his attack of faintness, and brother and
sister sat close to one another, shoulder touching shoulder. That
sense of nearness was the one tiny spark of comfort to both of them
on this dreary, dreary way.</p>

<p>The coach had lumbered on unceasingly since all
eternity&mdash;so it seemed to them both. Once there had been a
brief halt, when Héron's rough voice had ordered the soldier at the
horses' heads to climb on the box beside him, and once&mdash;it had
been a very little while ago&mdash;a terrible cry of pain and
terror had rung through the stillness of the night. Immediately
after that the horses had been put at a more rapid pace, but it had
seemed to Marguerite as if that one cry of pain had been repeated
by several others which sounded more feeble and soon appeared to be
dying away in the distance behind.</p>

<p>The soldier who sat opposite to them must have heard the cry
too, for he jumped up, as if wakened from sleep, and put his head
out of the window.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that cry, citizen?" he asked.</p>

<p>But only a curse answered him, and a peremptory command not to
lose sight of the prisoners by poking his head out of the
window.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the cry?" asked the soldier of Marguerite as he
made haste to obey.</p>

<p>"Yes! What could it be?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"It seems dangerous to drive so fast in this darkness," muttered
the soldier.</p>

<p>After which remark he, with the stolidity peculiar to his kind,
figuratively shrugged his shoulders, detaching himself, as it were,
of the whole affair.</p>

<p>"We should be out of the forest by now," he remarked in an
undertone a little while later; "the way seemed shorter
before."</p>

<p>Just then the coach gave an unexpected lurch to one side, and
after much groaning and creaking of axles and springs it came to a
standstill, and the citizen agent was heard cursing loudly and then
scrambling down from the box.</p>

<p>The next moment the carriage-door was pulled open from without,
and the harsh voice called out peremptorily:</p>

<p>"Citizen soldier, here&mdash;quick!&mdash;quick!&mdash;curse
you!&mdash;we'll have one of the horses down if you don't
hurry!"</p>

<p>The soldier struggled to his feet; it was never good to be slow
in obeying the citizen agent's commands. He was half-asleep and no
doubt numb with cold and long sitting still; to accelerate his
movements he was suddenly gripped by the arm and dragged
incontinently out of the coach.</p>

<p>Then the door was slammed to again, either by a rough hand or a
sudden gust of wind, Marguerite could not tell; she heard a cry of
rage and one of terror, and Héron's raucous curses. She cowered in
the corner of the carriage with Armand's head against her shoulder,
and tried to close her ears to all those hideous sounds.</p>

<p>Then suddenly all the sounds were hushed and all around
everything became perfectly calm and still&mdash;so still that at
first the silence oppressed her with a vague, nameless dread. It
was as if Nature herself had paused, that she might listen; and the
silence became more and more absolute, until Marguerite could hear
Armand's soft, regular breathing close to her ear.</p>

<p>The window nearest to her was open, and as she leaned forward
with that paralysing sense of oppression a breath of pure air
struck full upon her nostrils and brought with it a briny taste as
if from the sea.</p>

<p>It was not quite so dark; and there was a sense as of open
country stretching out to the limits of the horizon. Overhead a
vague greyish light suffused the sky, and the wind swept the clouds
in great rolling banks right across that light.</p>

<p>Marguerite gazed upward with a more calm feeling that was akin
to gratitude. That pale light, though so wan and feeble, was thrice
welcome after that inky blackness wherein shadows were less dark
than the lights. She watched eagerly the bank of clouds driven by
the dying gale.</p>

<p>The light grew brighter and faintly golden, now the banks of
clouds&mdash;storm-tossed and fleecy&mdash;raced past one another,
parted and reunited like veils of unseen giant dancers waved by
hands that controlled infinite space&mdash;advanced and rushed and
slackened speed again&mdash;united and finally torn asunder to
reveal the waning moon, honey-coloured and mysterious, rising as if
from an invisible ocean far away.</p>

<p>The wan pale light spread over the wide stretch of country,
throwing over it as it spread dull tones of indigo and of blue.
Here and there sparse, stunted trees with fringed gaunt arms
bending to prevailing winds proclaimed the neighbourhood of the
sea.</p>

<p>Marguerite gazed on the picture which the waning moon had so
suddenly revealed; but she gazed with eyes that knew not what they
saw. The moon had risen on her right&mdash;there lay the
east&mdash;and the coach must have been travelling due north,
whereas Crécy...</p>

<p>In the absolute silence that reigned she could perceive from
far, very far away, the sound of a church clock striking the
midnight hour; and now it seemed to her supersensitive senses that
a firm footstep was treading the soft earth, a footstep that drew
nearer&mdash;and then nearer still.</p>

<p>Nature did pause to listen. The wind was hushed, the night-birds
in the forest had gone to rest. Marguerite's heart beat so fast
that its throbbings choked her, and a dizziness clouded her
consciousness.</p>

<p>But through this state of torpor she heard the opening of the
carriage door, she felt the onrush of that pure, briny air, and she
felt a long, burning kiss upon her hands.</p>

<p>She thought then that she was really dead, and that God in His
infinite love had opened to her the outer gates of Paradise.</p>

<p>"My love!" she murmured.</p>

<p>She was leaning back in the carriage and her eyes were closed,
but she felt that firm fingers removed the irons from her wrists,
and that a pair of warm lips were pressed there in their stead.</p>

<p>"There, little woman, that's better so&mdash;is it not? Now let
me get hold of poor old Armand!"</p>

<p>It was Heaven, of course, else how could earth hold such
heavenly joy?</p>

<p>"Percy!" exclaimed Armand in an awed voice.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear!" murmured Marguerite feebly; "we are in Heaven you
and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Whereupon a ringing laugh woke the echoes of the silent
night.</p>

<p>"In Heaven, dear heart!" And the voice had a delicious earthly
ring in its whole-hearted merriment. "Please God, you'll both be at
Portel with me before dawn."</p>

<p>Then she was indeed forced to believe. She put out her hands and
groped for him, for it was dark inside the carriage; she groped,
and felt his massive shoulders leaning across the body of the
coach, while his fingers busied themselves with the irons on
Armand's wrist.</p>

<p>"Don't touch that brute's filthy coat with your dainty fingers,
dear heart," he said gaily. "Great Lord! I have worn that wretch's
clothes for over two hours; I feel as if the dirt had penetrated to
my bones."</p>

<p>Then with that gesture so habitual to him he took her head
between his two hands, and drawing her to him until the wan light
from without lit up the face that he worshipped, he gazed his fill
into her eyes.</p>

<p>She could only see the outline of his head silhouetted against
the wind-tossed sky; she could not see his eyes, nor his lips, but
she felt his nearness, and the happiness of that almost caused her
to swoon.</p>

<p>"Come out into the open, my lady fair," he murmured, and though
she could not see, she could feel that he smiled; "let God's pure
air blow through your hair and round your dear head. Then, if you
can walk so far, there's a small half-way house close by here. I
have knocked up the none too amiable host. You and Armand could
have half an hour's rest there before we go further on our
way."</p>

<p>"But you, Percy?&mdash;are you safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'dear, we are all of us safe until morning&mdash;time
enough to reach Le Portel, and to be aboard the <i>Daydream</i>
before mine amiable friend M. Chambertin has discovered his worthy
colleague lying gagged and bound inside the chapel of the Holy
Sepulchre. By Gad! how old Héron will curse&mdash;the moment he can
open his mouth!"</p>

<p>He half helped, half lifted her out of the carriage. The strong
pure air suddenly rushing right through to her lungs made her feel
faint, and she almost fell. But it was good to feel herself
falling, when one pair of arms amongst the millions on the earth
were there to receive her.</p>

<p>"Can you walk, dear heart?" he asked. "Lean well on me&mdash;it
is not far, and the rest will do you good."</p>

<p>"But you, Percy&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed, and the most complete joy of living seemed to
resound through that laugh. Her arm was in his, and for one moment
he stood still while his eyes swept the far reaches of the country,
the mellow distance still wrapped in its mantle of indigo, still
untouched by the mysterious light of the waning moon.</p>

<p>He pressed her arm against his heart, but his right hand was
stretched out towards the black wall of the forest behind him,
towards the dark crests of the pines in which the dying wind sent
its last mournful sighs.</p>

<p>"Dear heart," he said, and his voice quivered with the intensity
of his excitement, "beyond the stretch of that wood, from far away
over there, there are cries and moans of anguish that come to my
ear even now. But for you, dear, I would cross that wood to-night
and re-enter Paris to-morrow. But for you, dear&mdash;but for you,"
he reiterated earnestly as he pressed her closer to him, for a
bitter cry had risen to her lips.</p>

<p>She went on in silence. Her happiness was great&mdash;as great
as was her pain. She had found him again, the man whom she
worshipped, the husband whom she thought never to see again on
earth. She had found him, and not even now&mdash;not after those
terrible weeks of misery and suffering unspeakable&mdash;could she
feel that love had triumphed over the wild, adventurous spirit, the
reckless enthusiasm, the ardour of self-sacrifice.</p>

Eldorado</h2>

<p>It seems that in the pocket of Héron's coat there was a
letter-case with some few hundred francs. It was amusing to think
that the brute's money helped to bribe the ill-tempered keeper of
the half-way house to receive guests at midnight, and to ply them
well with food, drink, and the shelter of a stuffy coffee-room.</p>

<p>Marguerite sat silently beside her husband, her hand in his.
Armand, opposite to them, had both elbows on the table. He looked
pale and wan, with a bandage across his forehead, and his glowing
eyes were resting on his chief.</p>

<p>"Yes! you demmed young idiot," said Blakeney merrily, "you
nearly upset my plan in the end, with your yelling and screaming
outside the chapel gates."</p>

<p>"I wanted to get to you, Percy. I thought those brutes had got
you there inside that building."</p>

<p>"Not they!" he exclaimed. "It was my friend Héron whom they had
trussed and gagged, and whom my amiable friend M. Chambertin will
find in there to-morrow morning. By Gad! I would go back if only
for the pleasure of hearing Héron curse when first the gag is taken
from his mouth."</p>

<p>"But how was it all done, Percy? And there was de
Batz&mdash;"</p>

<p>"De Batz was part of the scheme I had planned for mine own
escape before I knew that those brutes meant to take Marguerite and
you as hostages for my good behaviour. What I hoped then was that
under cover of a tussle or a fight I could somehow or other
contrive to slip through their fingers. It was a chance, and you
know my belief in bald-headed Fortune, with the one solitary hair.
Well, I meant to grab that hair; and at the worst I could but die
in the open and not caged in that awful hole like some noxious
vermin. I knew that de Batz would rise to the bait. I told him in
my letter that the Dauphin would be at the Château d'Ourde this
night, but that I feared the revolutionary Government had got wind
of this fact, and were sending an armed escort to bring the lad
away. This letter Ffoulkes took to him; I knew that he would make a
vigorous effort to get the Dauphin into his hands, and that during
the scuffle that one hair on Fortune's head would for one second
only, mayhap, come within my reach. I had so planned the expedition
that we were bound to arrive at the forest of Boulogne by
nightfall, and night is always a useful ally. But at the
guard-house of the Rue Ste. Anne I realised for the first time that
those brutes had pressed me into a tighter corner than I had
pre-conceived."</p>

<p>He paused, and once again that look of recklessness swept over
his face, and his eyes&mdash;still hollow and circled&mdash;shone
with the excitement of past memories.</p>

<p>"I was such a weak, miserable wretch, then," he said, in answer
to Marguerite's appeal. "I had to try and build up some strength,
when&mdash;Heaven forgive me for the sacrilege&mdash;I had
unwittingly risked your precious life, dear heart, in that blind
endeavour to save mine own. By Gad! it was no easy task in that
jolting vehicle with that noisome wretch beside me for sole
company; yet I ate and I drank and I slept for three days and two
nights, until the hour when in the darkness I struck Héron from
behind, half-strangled him first, then gagged him, and finally
slipped into his filthy coat and put that loathsome bandage across
my head, and his battered hat above it all. The yell he gave when
first I attacked him made every horse rear&mdash;you must remember
it&mdash;the noise effectually drowned our last scuffle in the
coach. Chauvelin was the only man who might have suspected what had
occurred, but he had gone on ahead, and bald-headed Fortune had
passed by me, and I had managed to grab its one hair. After that it
was all quite easy. The sergeant and the soldiers had seen very
little of Héron and nothing of me; it did not take a great effort
to deceive them, and the darkness of the night was my most faithful
friend. His raucous voice was not difficult to imitate, and
darkness always muffles and changes every tone. Anyway, it was not
likely that those loutish soldiers would even remotely suspect the
trick that was being played on them. The citizen agent's orders
were promptly and implicitly obeyed. The men never even thought to
wonder that after insisting on an escort of twenty he should drive
off with two prisoners and only two men to guard them. If they did
wonder, it was not theirs to question. Those two troopers are
spending an uncomfortable night somewhere in the forest of
Boulogne, each tied to a tree, and some two leagues apart one from
the other. And now," he added gaily, "<i>en voiture</i>, my fair
lady; and you, too, Armand. 'Tis seven leagues to Le Portel, and we
must be there before dawn."</p>

<p>"Sir Andrew's intention was to make for Calais first, there to
open communication with the <i>Daydream</i> and then for Le
Portel," said Marguerite; "after that he meant to strike back for
the Château d'Ourde in search of me."</p>

<p>"Then we'll still find him at Le Portel&mdash;I shall know how
to lay hands on him; but you two must get aboard the
<i>Daydream</i> at once, for Ffoulkes and I can always look after
ourselves."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was one hour after midnight when&mdash;refreshed with food
and rest&mdash;Marguerite, Armand and Sir Percy left the half-way
house. Marguerite was standing in the doorway ready to go. Percy
and Armand had gone ahead to bring the coach along.</p>

<p>"Percy," whispered Armand, "Marguerite does not know?"</p>

<p>"Of course she does not, you young fool," retorted Percy
lightly. "If you try and tell her I think I would smash your
head."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;" said the young man with sudden vehemence; "can
you bear the sight of me? My God! when I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't think, my good Armand&mdash;not of that anyway. Only
think of the woman for whose sake you committed a crime&mdash;if
she is pure and good, woo her and win her&mdash;not just now, for
it were foolish to go back to Paris after her, but anon, when she
comes to England and all these past days are forgotten&mdash;then
love her as much as you can, Armand. Learn your lesson of love
better than I have learnt mine; do not cause Jeanne Lange those
tears of anguish which my mad spirit brings to your sister's eyes.
You were right, Armand, when you said that I do not know how to
love!"</p>

<p>But on board the <i>Daydream</i>, when all danger was past,
Marguerite felt that he did.</p>
