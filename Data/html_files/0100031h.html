</div>
<br>

<p class="first">I HAD a vague recollection of having heard my
friend Edward Malone, of the <i>Gazette</i>, speak of Professor
Challenger, with whom he had been associated in some remarkable
adventures. I am so busy, however, with my own profession, and my
firm has been so overtaxed with orders, that I know little of what
is going on in the world outside my own special interests. My
general recollection was that Challenger has been depicted as a
wild genius of a violent and intolerant disposition. I was greatly
surprised to receive a business communication from him which was in
the following terms:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">14 (Bis) , Enmore Gardens, Kensington.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I have occasion to engage the services of an
expert in Artesian borings. I will not conceal from you that my
opinion of experts is not a high one, and that I have usually found
that a man who, like myself, has a well-equipped brain can take a
sounder and broader view than the man who professes a special
knowledge (which, alas, is so often a mere profession) , and is
therefore limited in his outlook. None the less, I am disposed to
give you a trial. Looking down the list of Artesian authorities, a
certain oddity&mdash;I had almost written absurdity&mdash;in your
name attracted my attention, and I found upon inquiry that my young
friend, Mr. Edward Malone, was actually acquainted with you. I am
therefore writing to say that I should be glad to have an interview
with you, and that if you satisfy my requirements, and my standard
is no mean one, I may be inclined to put a most important matter
into your hands. I can say no more at present as the matter is of
extreme secrecy, which can only be discussed by word of mouth. I
beg, therefore, that you will at once cancel any engagement which
you may happen to have, and that you will call upon me at the above
address at 10.30 in the morning of next Friday. There is a scraper
as well as a mat, and Mrs. Challenger is most particular.</p>

<p class="letter">I remain, Sir, as I began,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">George Edward
Challenger</span>.</p>

<p><br>
I handed this letter to my chief clerk to answer, and he informed
the Professor that Mr. Peerless Jones would be glad to keep the
appointment as arranged. It was a perfectly civil business note,
but it began with the phrase: 'Your letter (undated) has been
received.'</p>

<p><br>
This drew a second epistle from the Professor:</p>
<br>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</i> he said and his writing
looked like a barbed-wire fence&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">I observe that you animadvert upon the trifle
that my letter was undated. Might I draw your attention to the fact
that, as some return for a monstrous taxation, our Government is in
the habit of affixing a small circular sign or stamp upon the
outside on the envelope which notifies the date of posting? Should
this sign be missing or illegible your remedy lies with the proper
postal authorities. Meanwhile, I would ask you to confine your
observations to matters which concern the business over which I
consult you, and to cease to comment upon the form which my own
letters may assume.</p>

<p><br>
It was clear to me that I was dealing with a lunatic, so I thought
it well before I went any further in the matter to call upon my
friend Malone, whom I had known since the old days when we both
played Rugger for Richmond. I found him the same jolly Irishman as
ever, and much amused at my first brush with Challenger.</p>

<p>'That's nothing, my boy,' said he. 'You'll feel as if you had
been skinned alive when you have been with him five minutes. He
beats the world for offensiveness.'</p>

<p>'But why should the world put up with it?'</p>

<p>'They don't. If you collected all the libel actions and all the
rows and all the police-court assaults&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Assaults!'</p>

<p>'Bless you, he would think nothing of throwing you downstairs if
you have a disagreement. He is a primitive cave-man in a lounge
suit. I can see him with a club in one hand and a jagged bit of
flint in the other. Some people are born out of their proper
century, but he is born out of his millennium. He belongs to the
early neolithic or thereabouts.'</p>

<p>'And he a professor!'</p>

<p>'There is the wonder of it! It's the greatest brain in Europe,
with a driving force behind it that can turn all his dreams into
facts. They do all they can to hold him back for his colleagues
hate him like poison, but a lot of trawlers might as well try to
hold back the <em>Berengaria</em>. He simply ignores them and
steams on his way.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said I, 'one thing is clear. I don't want to have
anything to do with him. I'll cancel that appointment.'</p>

<p>'Not a bit of it. You will keep it to the minute&mdash;and mind
that it is to the minute or you will hear of it.'</p>

<p>'Why should I?'</p>

<p>'Well, I'll tell you. First of all, don't take too seriously
what I have said about old Challenger. Everyone who gets close to
him learns to love him. There is no real harm in the old bear. Why,
I remember how he carried an Indian baby with the smallpox on his
back for a hundred miles from the back country down to the Madeira
river. He is big every way. He won't hurt if you get right with
him.'</p>

<p>'I won't give him the chance.'</p>

<p>'You will be a fool if you don't. Have you ever heard of the
Hengist Down Mystery&mdash;the shaft-sinking on the South
Coast?'</p>

<p>'Some secret coal-mining exploration, I understand.'</p>

<p>Malone winked. 'Well, you can put it down as that if you like.
You see, I am in the old man's confidence, and I can't say anything
until he gives the word. But I may tell you this, for it has been
in the Press. A man, Betterton, who made his money in rubber, left
his whole estate to Challenger some years ago, with the provision
that it should be used in the interests of science. It proved to be
an enormous sum&mdash;several millions. Challenger then bought a
property at Hengist Down, in Sussex. It was worthless land on the
north edge of the chalk country, and he got a large tract of it,
which he wired off. There was a deep gully in the middle of it.
Here he began to make an excavation. He announced'&mdash;here
Malone winked again&mdash;'that there was petroleum in England and
that he meant to prove it. He built a little model village with a
colony of well-paid workers who are all sworn to keep their mouths
shut. The gully is wired off as well as the estate, and the place
is guarded by bloodhounds. Several pressmen have nearly lost their
lives, to say nothing of the seats of their trousers, from these
creatures. It's a big operation, and Sir Thomas Morden's firm has
it in hand, but they also are sworn to secrecy. Clearly the time
has come when Artesian help is needed. Now, would you not be
foolish to refuse such a job as that, with all the interest and
experience and a big fat cheque at the end of it&mdash;to say
nothing of rubbing shoulders with the most wonderful man you have
ever met or are ever likely to meet?'</p>

<p>Malone's arguments prevailed, and Friday morning found me on my
way to Enmore Gardens, I took such particular care to be in time
that I found myself at the door twenty minutes too soon. I was
waiting in the street when it struck me that I recognized the
Rolls-Royce with the silver arrow mascot at the door. It was
certainly that of Jack Devonshire, the junior partner of the great
Morden firm. I had always known him as the most urbane of men, so
that it was rather a shock to me when he suddenly appeared, and
standing outside the door he raised both his hands, to heaven and
said with great fervour: 'Damn him! Oh, damn him!'</p>

<p>'What is up, Jack? You seem peeved this morning.'</p>

<p>'Hullo, Peerless! Are you in on this job, too?'</p>

<p>'There seems a chance of it.'</p>

<p>'Well, you find it chastening to the temper.'</p>

<p>'Rather more so than yours can stand, apparently.'</p>

<p>'Well, I should say so. The butler's message to me was: "The
Professor desired me to say, sir, that he was rather busy at
present eating an egg, and that if you would call at some more
convenient time he would very likely see you." That was the message
delivered by a servant. I may add that I had called to collect
forty-two thousand pounds that he owes us.'</p>

<p>I whistled.</p>

<p>'You can't get your money?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, he is all right about money. I'll do the old gorilla
the justice to say that he is open-handed with money. But he pays
when he likes and how he likes, and he cares for nobody. However,
you go and try your luck and see how you like it.' With that he
flung himself into his motor and was off.</p>

<p>I waited with occasional glances at my watch until the zero hour
should arrive. I am, if I may say so, a fairly hefty individual,
and a runner-up for the Belsize Boxing Club middle- weights, but I
have never faced an interview with such trepidation as this. It was
not physical, for I was confident I could hold my own if this
inspired lunatic should attack me, but it was a mixture of feelings
in which fear of some public scandal and dread of losing a
lucrative contract were mingled. However, things are always easier
when imagination ceases and action begins. I snapped up my watch
and made for the door.</p>

<p>It was opened by an old wooden-faced butler, a man who bore an
expression, or an absence of expression, which gave the impression
that he was so inured to shocks that nothing on earth would
surprise him.</p>

<p>'By appointment, sir?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>He glanced at a list in his hand.</p>

<p>'Your name, sir?... Quite so, Mr. Peerless Jones.... Ten-
thirty. Everything is in order. We have to be careful, Mr. Jones,
for we are much annoyed by journalists. The Professor, as you may
be aware, does not approve of the Press. This way, sir. Professor
Challenger is now receiving.'</p>

<p>The next instant I found myself in the presence. I believe that
my friend, Ted Malone, has described the man in his 'Lost World'
yarn better than I can hope to do, so I'll leave it at that. All I
was aware of was a huge trunk of a man behind a mahogany desk, with
a great spade-shaped black beard and two large grey eyes half
covered with insolent drooping eyelids. His big head sloped back,
his beard bristled forward, and his whole appearance conveyed one
single impression of arrogant intolerance. 'Well, what the devil do
you want?' was written all over him. I laid my card on the
table.</p>

<p>'Ah yes,' he said, picking it up and handling it as if he
disliked the smell of it. 'Of course. You are the expert so-
called. Mr. Jones&mdash;Mr. Peerless Jones. You may thank your
godfather, Mr. Jones, for it was this ludicrous prefix which first
drew my attention to you.'</p>

<p>'I am here, Professor Challenger, for a business interview and
not to discuss my own name,' said I, with all the dignity I could
master.</p>

<p>'Dear me, you seem to be a very touchy person, Mr. Jones. Your
nerves are in a highly irritable condition. We must walk warily in
dealing with you, Mr. Jones. Pray sit down and compose yourself. I
have been reading your little brochure upon the reclaiming of the
Sinai Peninsula. Did you write it yourself?'</p>

<p>'Naturally, sir. My name is on it.'</p>

<p>'Quite so! Quite so! But it does not always follow, does it?
However, I am prepared to accept your assertion. The book is not
without merit of a sort. Beneath the dullness of the diction one
gets glimpses of an occasional idea. There are germs of thought
here and there. Are you a married man?'</p>

<p>'No, sir. I am not.'</p>

<p>'Then there is some chance of your keeping a secret.'</p>

<p>'If I promised to do so, I would certainly keep my promise. 'So
you say. My young friend, Malone'&mdash;he spoke as if Ted were ten
years of age &mdash;'has a good opinion of you. He says that I may
trust you. This trust is a very great one, for I am engaged just
now in one of the greatest experiments&mdash;I may even say the
greatest experiment&mdash;in the history of the world. I ask for
your participation.'</p>

<p>'I shall be honoured.'</p>

<p>'It is indeed an honour. I will admit that I should have shared
my labours with no one were it not that the gigantic nature of the
undertaking calls for the highest technical skill. Now, Mr. Jones,
having obtained your promise of inviolable secrecy, I come down to
the essential point. It is this&mdash; that the world upon which we
live is itself a living organism, endowed, as I believe, with a
circulation, a respiration, and a nervous system of its own.'
Clearly the man was a lunatic.</p>

<p>'Your brain, I observe,' he continued, 'fails to register. But
it will gradually absorb the idea. You will recall how a moor or
heath resembles the hairy side of a giant animal. A certain analogy
runs through all nature. You will then consider the secular rise
and fall of land, which indicates the slow respiration of the
creature. Finally, you will note the fidgetings and scratchings
which appear to our Lilliputian perceptions as earthquakes and
convulsions.'</p>

<p>'What about volcanoes?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Tut, tut! They correspond to the heat spots upon our own
bodies.'</p>

<p>My brain whirled as I tried to find some answer to these
monstrous contentions.</p>

<p>'The temperature!' I cried. 'Is it not a fact that it rises
rapidly as one descends, and that the centre of the earth is liquid
heat?'</p>

<p>He waved my assertion aside.</p>

<p>'You are probably aware, sir, since Council schools are now
compulsory, that the earth is flattened at the poles. This means
that the pole is nearer to the centre than any other point and
would therefore be most affected by this heat of which you spoke.
It is notorious, of course, that the conditions of the poles are
tropical, is it not?'</p>

<p>'The whole idea is utterly new to me.'</p>

<p>'Of course it is. It is the privilege of the original thinker to
put forward ideas which are new and usually unwelcome to the common
clay. Now, sir, what is this?' He held up a small object which he
had picked from the table.</p>
<br>
<a id="pic2" name="pic2"></a>
<div align="center"><img src="0100031h-images/WTWS-02.png" alt=

<p class="caption">"Now, sir, what is this?" He held up a small<br>
object which he had picked from the table.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>'I should say it is a sea-urchin.'</p>

<p>'Exactly!' he cried, with an air of exaggerated surprise, as
when an infant has done something clever. 'It is a sea-
urchin&mdash;a common <em>echinus</em>. Nature repeats itself in
many forms regardless of the size. This <em>echinus</em> is a
model, a prototype, of the world. You perceive that it is roughly
circular, but flattened at the poles. Let us then regard the world
as a huge <em>echinus</em>. What are your objections?'</p>
<br>
<a id="pic3" name="pic3"></a>
<div align="center"><img src="0100031h-images/WTWS-03.png" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"I should say it is a sea urchin," I answered.
The man was clearly mad.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>My chief objection was that the thing was too absurd for
argument, but I did not dare to say so. I fished around for some
less sweeping assertion.</p>

<p>'A living creature needs food,' I said. 'Where could the world
sustain its huge bulk?'</p>

<p>'An excellent point&mdash;excellent!' said the Professor, with a
huge air of patronage. 'You have a quick eye for the obvious,
though you are slow in realizing the more subtle implications. How
does the world get nourishment? Again we turn to our little friend
the <em>echinus</em>. The water which surrounds it flows through
the tubes of this small creature and provides its nutrition.'</p>

<p>'Then you think that the water&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, sir. The ether. The earth browses upon a circular path in
the fields of space, and as it moves the ether is continually
pouring through it and providing its vitality. Quite a flock of
other little world-<em>echini</em> are doing the same thing, Venus,
Mars, and the rest, each with its own field for grazing.'</p>

<p>The man was clearly mad, but there was no arguing with him. He
accepted my silence as agreement and smiled at me in most
beneficent fashion.</p>

<p>'We are coming on, I perceive,' said he. 'Light is beginning to
break in. A little dazzling at first, no doubt, but we will soon
get used to it. Pray give me your attention while I found one or
two more observations upon this little creature in my hand.</p>

<p>'We will suppose that on this outer hard rind there were certain
infinitely small insects which crawled upon the surface. Would the
<em>echinus</em> ever be aware of their existence?'</p>

<p>'I should say not.'</p>

<p>'You can well imagine then, that the earth has not the least
idea of the way in which it is utilized by the human race. It is
quite unaware of this fungus growth of vegetation and evolution of
tiny animalcules which has collected upon it during its travels
round the sun as barnacles gather upon the ancient vessel. That is
the present state of affairs, and that is what I propose to
alter.'</p>

<p>I stared in amazement. 'You propose to alter it?'</p>

<p>'I propose to let the earth know that there is at least one
person, George Edward Challenger, who calls for
attention&mdash;who, indeed, insists upon attention. It is
certainly the first intimation it has ever had of the sort.'</p>

<p>'And how, sir, will you do this?'</p>

<p>'Ah, there we get down to business. You have touched the spot. I
will again call your attention to this interesting little creature
which I hold in my hand. It is all nerves and sensibility beneath
that protective crust. Is it not evident that if a parasitic
animalcule desired to call its attention it would sink a hole in
its shell and so stimulate its sensory apparatus?'</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>'Or, again, we will take the case of the homely flea or a
mosquito which explores the surface of the human body. We may be
unaware of its presence. But presently, when it sinks its proboscis
through the skin, which is our crust, we are disagreeably reminded
that we are not altogether alone. My plans now will no doubt begin
to dawn upon you. Light breaks in the darkness.'</p>

<p>'Good heavens! You propose to sink a shaft through the earth's
crust?'</p>

<p>He closed his eyes with ineffable complacency.</p>

<p>'You see before you,' he said, 'the first who will ever pierce
that horny hide. I may even put it in the present tense and say who
has pierced it.'</p>

<p>'You have done it!'</p>

<p>'With the very efficient aid of Morden and think I may say that
I have done it. Several years of constant work which has been
carried on night and day, and conducted by every known species of
drill, borer, crusher, and explosive, has at last brought us to our
goal.'</p>

<p>'You don't mean to say you are through the crust!'</p>

<p>'If your expressions denote bewilderment they may pass. If they
denote incredulity&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, sir, nothing of the kind.'</p>

<p>'You will accept my statement without question. We are through
the crust. It was exactly fourteen thousand four hundred and
forty-two yards thick, or roughly eight miles. In the course of our
sinking it may interest you to know that we have exposed a fortune
in the matter of coal-beds which would probably in the long run
defray the cost of the enterprise. Our chief difficulty has been
the springs of water in the lower chalk and Hastings sands, but
these we have overcome. The last stage has now been reached
&mdash;and the last stage is none other than Mr. Peerless Jones.
You, sir, represent the mosquito. Your Artesian borer takes the
place of the stinging proboscis. The brain has done its work. Exit
the thinker. Enter the mechanical one, the peerless one, with his
rod of metal. Do I make myself clear?'</p>

<p>'You talk of eight miles!' I cried. 'Are you aware, sir, that
five thousand feet is considered nearly the limit for Artesian
borings? I am acquainted with one in upper Silesia which is six
thousand two hundred feet deep, but it is looked upon as a
wonder.'</p>

<p>'You misunderstand me, Mr. Peerless. Either my explanation or
your brain is at fault, and I will not insist upon which. I am well
aware of the limits of Artesian borings, and it is not likely that
I would have spent millions of pounds upon my colossal tunnel if a
six-inch boring would have met my needs. All that I ask you is to
have a drill ready which shall be as sharp as possible, not more
than a hundred feet in length, and operated by an electric motor.
An ordinary percussion drill driven home by a weight will meet
every requirement.</p>

<p>'Why by an electric motor?'</p>

<p>'I am here, Mr. Jones, to give orders, not reasons. Before we
finish it may happen&mdash;it may, I say, happen&mdash;that your
very life may depend upon this drill being started from a distance
by electricity. It can, I presume, be done?'</p>

<p>'Certainly it can be done.'</p>

<p>'Then prepare to do it. The matter is not yet ready for your
actual presence, but your preparations may now be made. I have
nothing more to say.'</p>

<p>'But it is essential,' I expostulated, 'that you should let me
know what soil the drill is to penetrate. Sand, or clay, or chalk
would each need different treatment.'</p>

<p>'Let us say jelly,' said Challenger. 'Yes, we will for the
present suppose that you have to sink your drill into jelly. And
now, Mr. Jones, I have matters of some importance to engage my
mind, so I will wish you good morning. You can draw up a formal
contract with mention of your charges for my Head of Works.'</p>

<p>I bowed and turned, but before I reached the door my curiosity
overcame me. He was already writing furiously with a quill pen
screeching over the paper, and he looked up angrily at my
interruption.</p>

<p>'Well, sir, what now? I had hoped you were gone.</p>

<p>'I only wished to ask you, sir, what the object of so
extraordinary an experiment can be?'</p>

<p>'Away, sir, away!' he cried, angrily. 'Raise your mind above the
base mercantile and utilitarian needs of commerce. Shake off your
paltry standards of business. Science seeks knowledge. Let the
knowledge lead us where it will, we still must seek it. To know
once for all what we are, why we are, where we are, is that not in
itself the greatest of all human aspirations? Away, sir, away!'</p>

<p>His great black head was bowed over his papers once more and
blended with his beard. The quill pen screeched more shrilly than
ever. So I left him, this extraordinary man, with my head in a
whirl at the thought of the strange business in which I now found
myself to be his partner.</p>

<p>When I got back to my office I found Ted Malone waiting with a
broad grin upon his face to know the result of my interview.</p>

<p>'Well!' he cried. 'None the worse? No case of assault and
battery? You must have handled him very tactfully. What do you
think of the old boy?'</p>

<p>'The most aggravating, insolent, intolerant, self-opinionated
man I have ever met, but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Exactly!' cried Malone. 'We all come to that "but." Of course,
he is all you say and a lot more, but one feels that so big a man
is not to be measured in our scale, and that we can endure from him
what we would not stand from any other living mortal. Is that not
so?'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know him well enough yet to say, but I will admit
that if he is not a mere bullying megalomaniac, and if what he says
is true, then he certainly is in a class by himself. But is it
true?'</p>

<p>'Of course it is true. Challenger always delivers the goods.
Now, where are you exactly in the matter? Has he told you about
Hengist Down?'</p>

<p>'Yes, in a sketchy sort of way.'</p>

<p>'Well, you may take it from me that the whole thing is
colossal&mdash;colossal in conception and colossal in execution. He
hates pressmen, but I am in his confidence, for he knows that I
will publish no more than he authorizes. Therefore I have his
plans, or some of his plans. He is such a deep old bird that one
never is sure if one has really touched bottom. Anyhow, I know
enough to assure you that Hengist Down is a practical proposition
and nearly completed. My advice to you now is simply to await
events, and meanwhile to get your gear all ready. You'll hear soon
enough either from him or from me.'</p>

<p>As it happened, it was from Malone himself that I heard. He came
round quite early to my office some weeks later, as the bearer of a
message.</p>

<p>'I've come from Challenger' said he.</p>

<p>'You are like the pilot fish to the shark.'</p>

<p>'I'm proud to be anything to him. He really is a wonder. He has
done it all right. It's your turn now, and then he is ready to ring
up the curtain.'</p>

<p>'Well, I can't believe it until I see it, but I have everything
ready and loaded on a lorry. I could start it off at any
moment.'</p>

<p>'Then do so at once. I've given you a tremendous character for
energy and punctuality, so mind you don't let me down. In the
meantime, come down with me by rail and I will give you an idea of
what has to be done.'</p>

<p>It was a lovely spring morning&mdash;May 22nd, to be
exact&mdash;when we made that fateful journey which brought me on
to a stage which is destined to be historical. On the way Malone
handed me a note from Challenger which I was to accept as my
instructions.</p>
<br>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</i> (it ran)&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Upon arriving at Hengist Down you will put
yourself at the disposal of Mr. Barforth, the Chief Engineer, who
is in possession of my plans. My young friend, Malone, the bearer
of this, is also in touch with me and may protect me from any
personal contact. We have now experienced certain phenomena in the
shaft at and below the fourteen thousand-foot level which fully
bear out my views as to the nature of a planetary body, but some
more sensational proof is needed before I can hope to make an
impression upon the torpid intelligence of the modern scientific
world. That proof you are destined to afford, and they to witness.
As you descend in the lifts you will observe, presuming that you
have the rare quality of observation, that you pass in succession
the secondary chalk beds, the coal measures, some Devonian and
Cambrian indications, and finally the granite, through which the
greater part of our tunnel is conducted. The bottom is now covered
with tarpaulin, which I order you not to tamper with, as any clumsy
handling of the sensitive inner cuticle of the earth might bring
about premature results. At my instruction, two strong beams have
been laid across the shaft twenty feet above the bottom, with a
space between them. This space will act as a clip to hold up your
Artesian tube. Fifty feet of drill will suffice, twenty of which
will project below the beams, so that the point of the drill comes
nearly down to the tarpaulin. As you value your life do not let it
go further. Thirty feet will then project upwards in the shaft, and
when you have released it we may assume that not less than forty
feet of drill will bury itself in the earth's substance. As this
substance is very soft I find that you will probably need no
driving power, and that simply a release of the tube will suffice
by its own weight to drive it into the layer which we have
uncovered. These instructions would seem to be sufficient for any
ordinary intelligence, but I have little doubt that you will need
more, which can be referred to me through our young friend,
Malone.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">George Edward
Challenger</span>.</p>

<p><br>
It can be imagined that when we arrived at the station of
Storrington, near the northern foot of the South Downs, I was in a
state of considerable nervous tension. A weather-worn Vauxhall
thirty landaulette was awaiting us, and bumped us for six or seven
miles over by-paths and lanes which, in spite of their natural
seclusion, were deeply rutted and showed every sign of heavy
traffic. A broken lorry lying in the grass at one point showed that
others had found it rough going as well as we. Once a huge piece of
machinery which seemed to be the valves and piston of a hydraulic
pump projected itself, all rusted, from a clump of furze.</p>

<p>'That's Challenger's doing,' said Malone, grinning.</p>

<p>'Said it was one-tenth of an inch out of estimate, so he simply
chucked it by the wayside.'</p>

<p>'With a lawsuit to follow, no doubt.'</p>

<p>'A lawsuit! My dear chap, we should have a court of our own. We
have enough to keep a judge busy for a year. Government too. The
old devil cares for no one. Rex v. George Challenger and George
Challenger v. Rex. A nice devil's dance the two will have from one
court to another. Well, here we are. All right, Jenkins, you can
let us in!'</p>

<p>A huge man with a notable cauliflower ear was peering into the
car, a scowl of suspicion upon his face. He relaxed and saluted as
he recognized my companion.</p>

<p>'All right, Mr. Malone. I thought it was the American Associated
Press.'</p>

<p>'Oh, they are on the track, are they?'</p>

<p>'They to-day, and the <i>Times</i> yesterday. Oh, they are
buzzing round proper. Look at that!' He indicated a distant dot
upon the sky-line.</p>

<p>'See that glint ! That's the telescope of the Chicago Daily
News. Yes, they are fair after us now. I've seen 'em in rows, same
as the crows, along the Beacon yonder.'</p>

<p>'Poor old Press gang!' said Malone, as we entered a gate in a
formidable barbed wire fence. 'I am one of them myself, and I know
how it feels.</p>

<p>At this moment we heard a plaintive bleat behind us of 'Malone!
Ted Malone!' It came from a fat little man who had just arrived
upon a motor-bike and was at present struggling in the Herculean
grasp of the gatekeeper.</p>

<p>'Here, let me go!' he sputtered. 'Keep your hands off! Malone,
call off this gorilla of yours.'</p>

<p class="caption">"Here, let me go!" he sputtered. "Keep your

</div>
<br>

<p>'Let him go, Jenkins! He's a friend of mine!' cried Malone.
'Well, old bean, what is it? What are you after in these parts?
Fleet Street is your stamping ground&mdash;not the wilds of
Sussex.'</p>

<p>'You know what I am after perfectly well,' said our visitor.
'I've got the assignment to write a story about Hengist Down and I
can't go home without the copy.'</p>

<p>'Sorry, Roy, but you can't get anything here. You'll have to
stay on that side of the wire. If you want more you must go and see
Professor Challenger and get his leave.'</p>

<p>'I've been,' said the journalist, ruefully. 'I went this
morning.'</p>

<p>'Well, what did he say?'</p>

<p>'He said he would put me through the window.'</p>

<p>Malone laughed.</p>

<p>'And what did you say?'</p>

<p>'I said, "What's wrong with the door?" and I skipped through it
just to show there was nothing wrong with it. It was no time for
argument. I just went. What with that bearded Assyrian bull in
London, and this Thug down here, who has ruined my clean celluloid,
you seem to be keeping queer company, Ted Malone.'</p>

<p>'I can't help you, Roy; I would if I could. They say in Fleet
Street that you have never been beaten, but you are up against it
this time. Get back to the office, and if you just wait a few days
I'll give you the news as soon as the old man allows.'</p>

<p>'No chance of getting in?'</p>

<p>'Not an earthly.'</p>

<p>'Money no object?'</p>

<p>'You should know better than to say that.'</p>

<p>'They tell me it's a short cut to New Zealand.'</p>

<p>'It will be a short cut to the hospital if you butt in here,
Roy. Good-bye, now. We have some work to do of our own.</p>

<p>'That's Roy Perkins, the war correspondent,' said Malone as we
walked across the compound. 'We've broken his record, for he is
supposed to be undefeatable. It's his fat, little innocent face
that carries him through everything. We were on the same staff
once. Now there'&mdash;he pointed to a cluster of pleasant red-
roofed bungalows&mdash;'are the quarters of the men. They are a
splendid lot of picked workers who are paid far above ordinary
rates. They have to be bachelors and teetotallers, and under oath
of secrecy. I don't think there has been any leakage up to now.
That field is their football ground and the detached house is their
library and recreation room. The old man is some organizer, I can
assure you. This is Mr. Barforth, the head engineer-in-
charge.'</p>

<p>A long, thin, melancholy man with deep lines of anxiety upon his
face had appeared before us. 'I expect you are the Artesian
engineer,' said he, in a gloomy voice. 'I was told to expect you. I
am glad you've come, for I don't mind telling you that the
responsibility of this thing is getting on my nerves. We work away,
and I never know if it's a gush of chalk water, or a seam of coal,
or a squirt of petroleum, or maybe a touch of hell fire that is
coming next. We've been spared the last up to now, but you may make
the connection for all I know.'</p>

<p class="caption">"We work away, and I never know if it's a gush

</div>
<br>

<p>'Is it so hot down there?'</p>

<p>'Well, it's hot. There's no denying it. And yet maybe it is not
hotter than the barometric pressure and the confined space might
account for. Of course, the ventilation is awful. We pump the air
down, but two-hour shifts are the most the men can do&mdash;and
they are willing lads too. The Professor was down yesterday, and he
was very pleased with it all. You had best join us at lunch, and
then you will see it for yourself.'</p>

<p>After a hurried and frugal meal we were introduced with loving
assiduity upon the part of the manager to the contents of his
engine-house, and to the miscellaneous scrap-heap of disused
implements with which the grass was littered. On one side was a
huge dismantled Arrol hydraulic shovel, with which the first
excavations had been rapidly made. Beside it was a great engine
which worked a continuous steel rope on which the skips were
fastened which drew up the debris by successive stages from the
bottom of the shaft. In the power-house were several Escher Wyss
turbines of great horse-power running at one hundred and forty
revolutions a minute and governing hydraulic accumulators which
evolved a pressure of fourteen hundred pounds per square inch,
passing in three-inch pipes down the shaft and operating four rock
drills with hollow cutters of the Brandt type. Abutting upon the
engine-house was the electric house supplying power for a very
large lighting instalment, and next to that again was an extra
turbine of two hundred horse-power, which drove a ten-foot fan
forcing air down a twelve-inch pipe to the bottom of the workings.
All these wonders were shown with many technical explanations by
their proud operator, who was well on his way to boring me stiff,
as I may in turn have done my reader. There came a welcome
interruption, however, when I heard the roar of wheels and rejoiced
to see my Leyland three-tonner come rolling and heaving over the
grass, heaped up with tools and sections of tubing, and bearing my
foreman, Peters, and a very grimy assistant in front. The two of
them set to work at once to unload my stuff and to carry it in.
Leaving them at their work, the manager, with Malone and myself,
approached the shaft.</p>

<p>It was a wondrous place, on a very much larger scale than I had
imagined. The spoil banks, which represented the thousands of tons
removed, had been built up into a great horseshoe around it, which
now made a considerable hill. In the concavity of this horseshoe,
composed of chalk, clay, coal, and granite, there rose up a bristle
of iron pillars and wheels from which the pumps and the lifts were
operated. They connected with the brick power building which filled
up the gap in the horseshoe. Beyond it lay the open mouth of the
shaft, a huge yawning pit, some thirty or forty feet in diameter,
lined and topped with brick and cement. As I craned my neck over
the side and gazed down into the dreadful abyss, which I had been
assured was eight miles deep, my brain reeled at the thought of
what it represented. The sunlight struck the mouth of it
diagonally, and I could only see some hundreds of yards of dirty
white chalk, bricked here and there where the surface had seemed
unstable. Even as I looked, however, I saw, far, far down in the
darkness, a tiny speck of light, the smallest possible dot, but
clear and steady against the inky background.</p>

<p>'What is that light?' I asked.</p>

<p>Malone bent over the parapet beside me.</p>

<p>'That's one of the cages coming up,' said he. 'Rather wonderful,
is it not? That is a mile or more from us, and that little gleam is
a powerful arc lamp. It travels quickly, and will be here in a few
minutes.'</p>

<p>Sure enough the pin-point of light came larger and larger, until
it flooded the tube with its silvery radiance, and I had to turn
away my eyes from its blinding glare. A moment later the iron cage
clashed up to the landing stage, and four men crawled out of it and
passed on to the entrance.</p>

<p>'Nearly all in,' said Malone. 'It is no joke to do a two-hour
shift at that depth. Well, some of your stuff is ready to hand
here. I suppose the best thing we can do is to go down. Then you
will be able to judge the situation for yourself.'</p>

<p>There was an annexe to the engine-house into which he led me. A
number of baggy suits of the lightest tussore material were hanging
from the wall. Following Malone's example I took off every stitch
of my clothes, and put on one of these suits, together with a pair
of rubber-soled slippers. Malone finished before I did and left the
dressing-room. A moment later I heard a noise like ten dog-fights
rolled into one, and rushing out I found my friend rolling on the
ground with his arms round the workman who was helping to stack my
artesian tubing. He was endeavouring to tear something from him to
which the other was most desperately clinging. But Malone was too
strong for him, tore the object out of his grasp, and danced upon
it until it was shattered to pieces. Only then did I recognize that
it was a photographic camera. My grimy-faced artisan rose ruefully
from the floor.</p>

<p>'Confound you, Ted Malone!' said he. 'That was a new ten- guinea
machine.'</p>
<br>
<a id="pic6" name="pic6"></a>
<div align="center"><img src="0100031h-images/WTWS-06.png" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"Confound you, Ted Malone! That was a new
ten-guinea machine."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>'Can't help it, Roy. I saw you take the snap, and there was only
one thing to do.'</p>

<p>'How the devil did you get mixed up with my outfit?' I asked,
with righteous indignation.</p>

<p>The rascal winked and grinned. 'There are always and means,'
said he.</p>

<p>'But don't blame your foreman. He thought it was just a rag. I
swapped clothes with his assistant, and in I came.'</p>

<p>'And out you go,' said Malone. 'No use arguing, Roy. If
Challenger were here he would set the dogs on you. I've been in a
hole myself so I won't be hard, but I am watch-dog here, and I can
bite as well as bark. Come on! Out you march!'</p>

<p>So our enterprising visitor was marched by two grinning workmen
out of the compound. So now the public will at last understand the
genesis of that wonderful four-column article headed 'Mad Dream of
a Scientist' with the subtitle. 'A Bee-line to Australia,' which
appeared in The Adviser some days later and brought Challenger to
the verge of apoplexy, and the editor of The Adviser to the most
disagreeable and dangerous interview of his lifetime. The article
was a highly-coloured and exaggerated account of the adventure of
Roy Perkins, 'our experienced war correspondent' and it contained
such purple passages as 'this hirsute bully of Enmore Gardens,' 'a
compound guarded by barbed wire, plug-uglies, and bloodhounds,' and
finally, 'I was dragged from the edge of the Anglo-Australian
tunnel by two ruffians, the more savage being a jack-of-all trades
whom I had previously known by sight as a hanger-on of the
journalistic profession, while the other, a sinister figure in a
strange tropical garb, was posing as an Artesian engineer, though
his appearance was more reminiscent of Whitechapel.' Having ticked
us off in this way, the rascal had an elaborate description of
rails at the pit mouth, and of a zigzag excavation by which
funicular trains were to burrow into the earth.</p>

<p>The only practical inconvenience arising from the article was
that it notably increased that line of loafers who sat upon the
South Downs waiting for something to happen. The day came when it
did happen and when they wished themselves elsewhere.</p>

<p>My foreman with his faked assistant had littered the place with
all my apparatus, my bellbox, my crowsfoot, the V-drills, the rods,
and the weight, but Malone insisted that we disregard all that and
descend ourselves to the lowest level. To this end we entered the
cage, which was of latticed steel, and in the company of the chief
engineer we shot down into the bowels of the earth. There were a
series of automatic lifts, each with its own operating station
hollowed out in the side of the excavation. They operated with
great speed, and the experience was more like a vertical railway
journey than the deliberate fall which we associate with the
British lift.</p>

<p>Since the cage was latticed and brightly illuminated, we had a
clear view of the strata which we passed. I was conscious of each
of them as we flashed past. There were the sallow lower chalk, the
coffee-coloured Hastings beds, the lighter Ashburnham beds, the
dark carboniferous clays, and then, gleaming in the electric light,
band after band of jet-black, sparkling coal alternating with the
rings of clay. Here and there brickwork had been inserted, but as a
rule the shaft was self-supported, and one could but marvel at the
immense labour and mechanical skill which it represented. Beneath
the coal-beds I was conscious of jumbled strata of a concrete-like
appearance, and then we shot down into the primitive granite, where
the quartz crystals gleamed and twinkled as if the dark walls were
sown with the dust of diamonds. Down we went and ever
down&mdash;lower now than ever mortals had ever before penetrated.
The archaic rocks varied wonderfully in colour, and I can never
forget one broad belt of rose-coloured felspar, which shone with an
unearthly beauty before our powerful lamps. Stage after stage, and
lift after lift, the air getting ever closer and hotter until even
the light tussore garments were intolerable and the sweat was
pouring down into those rubber-soled slippers. At last, just as I
was thinking that I could stand it no more, the last lift came to a
stand and we stepped out upon a circular platform which had been
cut in the rock. I noticed that Malone gave a curiously suspicious
glance round at the walls as he did so. If I did not know him to be
amongst the bravest of men, I should say that he was exceedingly
nervous.</p>

<p>'Funny-looking stuff,' said the chief engineer, passing his hand
over the nearest section of rock. He held it to the light and
showed that it was glistening with a curious slimy scum. 'There
have been shiverings and tremblings down here. I don't know what we
are dealing with. The Professor seems pleased with it, but it's all
new to me.'</p>

<p>'I am bound to say I've seen that wall fairly shake itself,'
said Malone. 'Last time I was down here we fixed those two cross-
beams for your drill, and when we cut into it for the supports it
winced at every stroke. The old man's theory seemed absurd in solid
old London town, but down here, eight miles under the surface, I am
not so sure about it.'</p>

<p>'If you saw what was under that tarpaulin you would be even less
sure,' said the engineer. 'All this lower rock cut like cheese, and
when we were through it we came on a new formation like nothing on
earth. "Cover it up! Don't touch it!" said the Professor. So we
tarpaulined it according to his instructions, and there it
lies.</p>

<p>'Could we not have a look?'</p>

<p>A frightened expression came over the engineer's lugubrious
countenance.</p>

<p>'It's no joke disobeying the Professor,' said he. 'He is so damn
cunning, too, that you never know what check he has set on you.
However, we'll have a peep and chance it.'</p>

<p>He turned down our reflector lamp so that the light gleamed upon
the black tarpaulin. Then he stooped and, seizing a rope which
connected up with the corner of the covering, he disclosed
half-a-dozen square yards of the surface beneath it.</p>

<p>It was a most extraordinary and terrifying sight. The floor
consisted of some greyish material, glazed and shiny, which rose
and fell in slow palpitation. The throbs were not direct, but gave
the impression of a gentle ripple or rhythm, which ran across the
surface. This surface itself was not entirely homogeneous, but
beneath it, seen as through ground glass, there were dim whitish
patches or vacuoles, which varied constantly in shape and size. We
stood all three gazing spell-bound at this extraordinary sight.</p>

<p>'Does look rather like a skinned animal,' said Malone, in an
awed whisper. 'The old man may not be so far out with his blessed
<em>echinus</em>.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord!' I cried. 'And am I to plunge a harpoon into that
beast!'</p>

<p>'That's your privilege, my son,' said Malone, 'and, sad to
relate, unless I give it a miss in baulk, I shall have to be at
your side when you do it.'</p>

<p>'Well, I won't,' said the head engineer, with decision.</p>

<p>'I was never clearer on anything than I am on that. If the old
man insists, then I resign my portfolio. Good Lord, look at
that!'</p>

<p>The grey surface gave a sudden heave upwards, welling towards us
as a wave does when you look down from the bulwarks. Then it
subsided and the dim beatings and throbbings continued as before.
Barforth lowered the rope and replaced the tarpaulin.</p>

<p>'Seemed almost as if it knew we were here,' said he.</p>

<p>'Why should it swell up towards us like that? I expect the light
had some sort of effect upon it.'</p>

<p>'What am I expected to do now?' I asked. Mr. Barforth pointed to
two beams which lay across the pit just under the stopping place of
the lift. There was an interval of about nine inches between
them.</p>

<p>'That was the old man's idea,' said he. 'I think I could have
fixed it better, but you might as well try to argue with a mad
buffalo. It is easier and safer just to do whatever he says. His
idea is that you should use your six-inch bore and fasten it in
some way between these supports.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't think there would be much difficulty about that,'
I answered. 'I'll take the job over as from to-day.'</p>

<p>It was, as one might imagine, the strangest experience of my
very varied life which has included well-sinking in every continent
upon earth. As Professor Challenger was so insistent that the
operation should be started from a distance, and as I began to see
a good deal of sense in his contention, I had to plan some method
of electric control, which was easy enough as the pit was wired
from top to bottom. With infinite care my foreman, Peters, and I
brought down our lengths of tubing and stacked them on the rocky
ledge. Then we raised the stage of the lowest lift so as to give
ourselves room. As we proposed to use the percussion system, for it
would not do to trust entirely to gravity, we hung our
hundred-pound weight over a pulley beneath the lift, and ran our
tubes down beneath it with a V-shaped terminal. Finally, the rope
which held the weight was secured to the side of the shaft in such
a way that an electrical discharge would release it. It was
delicate and difficult work done in a more than tropical heat, and
with the ever-present feeling that a slip of a foot or the dropping
of a tool upon the tarpaulin beneath us might bring about some
inconceivable catastrophe. We were awed, too, by our surroundings.
Again and again I have seen a strange quiver and shiver pass down
the walls, and have even felt a dull throb against my hands as I
touched them. Neither Peters nor I were very sorry when we
signalled for the last time that we were ready for the surface, and
were able to report to Mr. Barforth that Professor Challenger could
make his experiment as soon as he chose.</p>

<p>And it was not long that we had to wait. Only three days after
my date of completion my notice arrived.</p>

<p>It was an ordinary invitation card such as one uses for 'at
homes,' and it ran thus:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">PROFESSOR G.E. CHALLENGER,<br>
F.R.S., MD., D.Sc., etc.<br>

of so many honorary degrees and appointments that<br>

requests the attendance of<br>
MR. JONES (no lady)<br>

<p><br>
I found that Malone had just received a similar missive over which
he was chuckling.</p>

<p>'It is mere swank sending it to us,' said he. 'We have to be
there whatever happens, as the hangman said to the murderer. But I
tell you this has set all London buzzing. The old man is where he
likes to be, with a pin-point limelight right on his hairy old
head.'</p>

<p>And so at last the great day came. Personally I thought it well
to go down the night before so as to be sure that everything was in
order. Our borer was fixed in position, the weight was adjusted,
the electric contacts could be easily switched on, and I was
satisfied that my own part in this strange experiment would be
carried out without a hitch. The electric controls were operated at
a point some five hundred yards from the mouth of the shaft, to
minimize any personal danger. When on the fateful morning, an ideal
English summer day, I came to the surface with my mind assured, I
climbed half-way up the slope of the Down in order to have a
general view of the proceedings.</p>

<p>All the world seemed to be coming to Hengist Down. As far as we
could see the roads were dotted with people. Motor-cars came
bumping and swaying down the lanes, and discharged their passengers
at the gate of the compound. This was in most cases the end of
their progress. A powerful band of janitors waited at the entrance,
and no promises or bribes, but only the production of the coveted
buff tickets, could get them any farther. They dispersed therefore
and joined the vast crowd which was already assembling on the side
of the hill and covering the ridge with a dense mass of spectators.
The place was like Epsom Downs on the Derby Day. Inside the
compound certain areas had been wired-off, and the various
privileged people were conducted to the particular pen to which
they had been allotted. There was one for peers, one for members of
the House of Commons, and one for the heads of learned societies
and the men of fame in the scientific world, including Le Pellier
of the Sorbonne and Dr. Driesinger of the Berlin Academy. A special
reserved enclosure with sandbags and a corrugated iron roof was set
aside for three members of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>At a quarter past eleven a succession of chars-a-bancs brought
up specially-invited guests from the station and I went down into
the compound to assist at the reception. Professor Challenger stood
by the select enclosure, resplendent in frock-coat, white
waistcoat, and burnished top-hat, his expression a blend of
overpowering and almost offensive benevolence, mixed with most
portentous self-importance.</p>

<p>'Clearly a typical victim of the Jehovah complex,' as one of his
critics described him. He assisted in conducting and occasionally
in propelling his guests into their proper places, and then, having
gathered the elite of the company around him, he took his station
upon the top of a convenient hillock and looked around him with the
air of the chairman who expects some welcoming applause. As none
was forthcoming, he plunged at once into his subject, his voice
booming to the farthest extremities of the enclosure.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' he roared, 'upon this occasion I have no need to
include the ladies. If I have not invited them to be present with
us this morning it is not, I can assure you, for want of
appreciation, for I may say'&mdash;with elephantine humour and mock
modesty&mdash;'that the relations between us upon both sides have
always been excellent, and indeed intimate. The real reason is that
some small element of danger is involved in our experiment, though
it is not sufficient to justify the discomposure which I see upon
many of your faces. It will interest the members of the Press to
know that I have reserved very special seats for them upon the
spoil banks which immediately overlook the scene of the operation.
They have shown an interest which is sometimes indistinguishable
from impertinence in my affairs, so that on this occasion at least
they cannot complain that I have been remiss in studying their
convenience. If nothing happens, which is always possible, I have
at least done my best for them. If, on the other hand, something
does happen, they will be in an excellent position to experience
and record it, should they ultimately feel equal to the task.</p>

<p>'It is, as you will readily understand, impossible for a man of
science to explain to what I may describe, without undue
disrespect, as the common herd, the various reasons for his
conclusions or his actions. I hear some unmannerly interruptions,
and I will ask the gentleman with the horn spectacles to cease
waving his umbrella. (A voice: "Your description of your guests,
sir, is most offensive.") Possibly it is my phrase, "the common
herd," which has ruffled the gentleman. Let us say, then, that my
listeners are a most uncommon herd. We will not quibble over
phrases. I was about to say, before I was interrupted by this
unseemly remark, that the whole matter is very fully and lucidly
discussed in my forthcoming volume upon the earth, which I may
describe with all due modesty as one of the epoch-making books of
the world's history. (General interruption and cries of "Get down
to the facts!" "What are we here for?" "Is this a practical joke?")
I was about to make the matter clear, and if I have any further
interruption I shall be compelled to take means to preserve decency
and order, the lack of which is so painfully obvious. The position
is, then, that I have sunk a shaft through the crust of the earth
and that I am about to try the effect of a vigorous stimulation of
its sensory cortex, a delicate operation which will be carried out
by my subordinates, Mr. Peerless Jones, a self-styled expert in
Artesian borings, and Mr. Edward Malone, who represents myself upon
this occasion. The exposed and sensitive substance will be pricked,
and how it will react is a matter for conjecture. If you will now
kindly take your seats these two gentlemen will descend into the
pit and make the final adjustments. I will then press the electric
button upon this table and the experiment will be complete.'</p>

<p>An audience after one of Challenger's harangues usually felt as
if, like the earth, its protective epidermis had been pierced and
its nerves laid bare. This assembly was no exception, and there was
a dull murmur of criticism and resentment as they returned to their
places.</p>

<p>Challenger sat alone on the top of the mound, a small table
beside him, his black mane and beard vibrating with excitement, a
most portentous figure. Neither Malone nor I could admire the
scene, however, for we hurried off upon our extraordinary errand.
Twenty minutes later we were at the bottom of the shaft, and had
pulled the tarpaulin from the exposed surface.</p>

<p class="caption">Twenty minutes later, we were at the bottom of

and had pulled the tarpaulin from the exposed surface.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>It was an amazing sight which lay before us. By some strange
cosmic telepathy the old planet seemed to know that an unheard-of
liberty was about to be attempted. The exposed surface was like a
boiling pot. Great grey bubbles rose and burst with a crackling
report. The air-spaces and vacuoles below the skin separated and
coalesced in an agitated activity. The transverse ripples were
stronger and faster in their rhythm than before. A dark purple
fluid appeared to pulse in the tortuous anastomoses of channels
which lay under the surface. The throb of life was in it all. A
heavy smell made the air hardly fit for human lungs.</p>

<p>My gaze was fixed upon this strange spectacle when Malone at my
elbow gave a sudden gasp of alarm. 'My God, Jones!' he cried. 'Look
there!'</p>
<br>
<a id="pic8" name="pic8"></a>
<div align="center"><img src="0100031h-images/WTWS-08.png" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"My God, Jones!" he cried. "Look there!"</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>I gave one glance, and the next instant I released the electric
connection and I sprang into the lift. 'Come on!' I cried. 'It may
be a race for life!'</p>

<p>What we had seen was indeed alarming. The whole lower shaft, it
would seem, had shared in the increased activity which we had
observed below, and the walls were throbbing and pulsing in
sympathy. This movement had reacted upon the holes in which the
beams rested, and it was clear that a very little further
retraction&mdash;a matter of inches&mdash;the beams would fall. If
they did so then the sharp end of my rod would, of course,
penetrate the earth quite independently of the electric release.
Before that happened it was vital that Malone and I should be out
of the shaft. To be eight miles down in the earth with the chance
any instant of some extraordinary convulsion taking place was a
terrible prospect. We fled wildly for the surface.</p>

<p>Shall either of us ever forget that nightmare journey? The lifts
whizzed and buzzed and yet the minutes seemed to be hours. As we
reached each stage we sprang out, jumped into the next lift,
touched the release and flew onwards. Through the steel latticed
roof we could see far away the little circle of light which marked
the mouth of the shaft. Now it grew wider and wider, until it came
full circle and our glad eyes rested upon the brickwork of the
opening. Up we shot, and up&mdash;and then at last in a glad moment
of joy and thankfulness we sprang out of our prison and had our
feet upon the green sward once more. But it was touch and go. We
had not gone thirty paces from the shaft when far down in the
depths my iron dart shot into the nerve ganglion of old Mother
Earth and the great moment had arrived.</p>

<p>What was it happened? Neither Malone nor I was in a position to
say, for both of us were swept off our feet as by a cyclone and
swirled along the grass, revolving round and round like two curling
stones upon an ice rink.</p>
<br>
<a id="pic9" name="pic9"></a>
<div align="center"><img src="0100031h-images/WTWS-09.png" alt=

<p class="caption">Both of us were swept off our feet as by a

</div>
<br>

<p>At the same time our ears were assailed by the most horrible
yell that ever yet was heard. Who is there of all the hundreds who
have attempted it who has ever yet described adequately that
terrible cry? It was a howl in which pain, anger, menace, and the
outraged majesty of Nature all blended into one hideous shriek.</p>
<br>
<a id="pic10" name="pic10"></a>
<div align="center"><img src="0100031h-images/WTWS-10.png" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">It was a howl in which pain, anger, menace, and

</div>
<br>

<p>For a full minute it lasted, a thousand sirens in one,
paralysing all the great multitude with its fierce insistence, and
floating away through the still summer air until it went echoing
along the whole South Coast and even reached our French neighbours
across the Channel. No sound in history has ever equalled the cry
of the injured Earth.</p>

<p>Dazed and deafened, Malone and I were aware of the shock and of
the sound, but it is from the narrative of others that we learned
the other details of that extraordinary scene.</p>

<p>The first emergence from the bowels of the earth consisted of
the lift cages. The other machinery being against the walls escaped
the blast, but the solid floors of the cages took the full force of
the upward current. When several separate pellets are placed in a
blow-pipe they still shoot forth in their order and separately from
each other. So the fourteen lift cages appeared one after the other
in the air, each soaring after the other, and describing a glorious
parabola which landed one of them in the sea near Worthing pier,
and a second one in a field not far from Chichester. Spectators
have averred that of all the strange sights that they had ever seen
nothing could exceed that of the fourteen lift cages sailing
serenely through the blue heavens.</p>

<p>Then came the geyser. It was an enormous spout of vile treacly
substance of the consistence of tar, which shot up into the air to
a height which has been computed at two thousand feet. An
inquisitive aeroplane, which had been hovering over the scene, was
picked off as by an Archie and made a forced landing, man and
machine buried in filth. This horrible stuff, which had a most
penetrating and nauseous odour, may have represented the life blood
of the planet, or it may be, as Professor Driesinger and the Berlin
School maintain, that it is a protective secretion, analogous to
that of the skunk, which Nature has provided in order to defend
Mother Earth from intrusive Challengers. If that were so the prime
offender, seated on his throne upon the hillock, escaped
untarnished, while the unfortunate Press were so soaked and
saturated, being in the direct line of fire, that none of them was
capable of entering decent society for many weeks. This gush of
putridity was blown southwards by the breeze, and descended upon
the unhappy crowd who had waited so long and so patiently upon the
crest of the Downs to see what would happen. There were no
casualties. No home was left desolate, but many were made
odoriferous, and still carry within their walls some souvenir of
that great occasion.</p>

<p>And then came the closing of the pit. As Nature slowly closes a
wound from below upwards, so does the Earth with extreme rapidity
mend any rent which is made in its vital substance. There was a
prolonged high-pitched crash as the sides of the shaft came
together, the sound, reverberating from the depths and then rising
higher and higher until with a deafening bang the brick circle at
the orifice flattened out and clashed together, while a tremor like
a small earthquake shook down the spoil banks and piled a pyramid
fifty feet high of debris and broken iron over the spot where the
hole had been. Professor Challenger's experiment was not only
finished, it was buried from human sight for ever. If it were not
for the obelisk which has now been erected by the Royal Society it
is doubtful if our descendants would ever know the exact site of
that remarkable occurrence.</p>

<p>And then came the grand finale. For a long period after these
successive phenomena there was a hush and a tense stillness as folk
reassembled their wits and tried to realize exactly what had
occurred and how it had come about. And then suddenly the mighty
achievement, the huge sweep of the conception, the genius and
wonder of the execution, broke upon their minds. With one impulse
they turned upon Challenger. From every part of the field there
came the cries of admiration, and from his hillock he could look
down upon the lake of upturned faces broken only by the rise and
fall of the waving handkerchiefs. As I look back I see him best as
I saw him then. He rose from his chair, his eyes half closed, a
smile of conscious merit upon his face, his left hand upon his hip,
his right buried in the breast of his frock-coat. Surely that
picture will be fixed for ever, for I heard the cameras clicking
round me like crickets in a field.</p>

<p>The June sun shone golden upon him as he turned gravely bowing
to each quarter of the compass. Challenger the super scientist,
Challenger the arch-pioneer, Challenger the first man of all men
whom Mother Earth had been compelled to recognize.</p>

<p>Only a word by way of epilogue. It is of course well known that
the effect of the experiment was a world-wide one. It is true that
nowhere did the injured planet emit such a howl as at the actual
point of penetration, but she showed that she was indeed one entity
by her conduct elsewhere. Through every vent and every volcano she
voiced her indignation. Hecla bellowed until the Icelanders feared
a cataclysm. Vesuvius blew its head off. Etna spewed up a quantity
of lava, and a suit of half-a- million lira damages has been
decided against Challenger in the Italian Courts for the
destruction of vineyards. Even in Mexico and in the belt of Central
America there were signs of intense Plutonic indignation, and the
howls of Stromboli filled the whole Eastern Mediterranean. It has
been the common ambition of mankind to set the whole world talking.
To set the whole world screaming was the privilege of Challenger
alone.</p>
