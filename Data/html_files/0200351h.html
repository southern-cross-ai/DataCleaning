<h2>1 - THE "CANARY"</h2>

<p>In the offices of the Homicide Bureau of the Detective Division
of the New York Police Department, on the third floor of the police
headquarters building in Centre Street, there is a large steel
filing cabinet; and within it, among thousands of others of its
kind, there reposes a small green index card on which is typed:
"ODELL, MARGARET. 184 West 71st Street. Sept. 10. Murder: Strangled
about 11 P.M. Apartment ransacked. Jewelry stolen. Body found by
Amy Gibson, maid."</p>

<p>Here, in a few commonplace words, is the bleak, unadorned
statement of one of the most astonishing crimes in the police
annals of this country&mdash;a crime so contradictory, so baffling,
so ingenious, so unique, that for many days the best minds of the
police department and the district attorney's office were
completely at a loss as to even a method of approach. Each line of
investigation only tended to prove that Margaret Odell could not
possibly have been murdered. And yet, huddled on the great silken
davenport in her living room lay the girl's strangled body, giving
the lie to so grotesque a conclusion.</p>

<p>The true story of this crime, as it eventually came to light
after a disheartening period of utter darkness and confusion,
revealed many strange and bizarre ramifications, many dark recesses
of man's unexplored nature, and the uncanny subtlety of a human
mind sharpened by desperate and tragic despair. And it also
revealed a hidden page of passional melodrama which, in its essence
and organisms, was no less romantic and fascinating than that
vivid, theatrical section of the <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i>
which deals with the fabulous love of Baron Nucingen for Esther van
Gobseck, and with the unhappy Torpille's tragic death.</p>

<p>Margaret Odell was a product of the bohemian demimonde of
Broadway&mdash;a scintillant figure who seemed somehow to typify
the gaudy and spurious romance of transient gaiety. For nearly two
years before her death she had been the most conspicuous and, in a
sense, popular figure of the city's night life. In our
grandparents' day she might have had conferred upon her that
somewhat questionable designation "the toast of the town"; but
today there are too many aspirants for this classification, too
many cliques and violent schisms in the Lepidoptera of our cafe
life, to permit of any one competitor being thus singled out. But,
for all the darlings of both professional and lay press agents,
Margaret Odell was a character of unquestioned fame in her little
world.</p>

<p>Her notoriety was due in part to certain legendary tales of her
affairs with one or two obscure potentates in the backwashes of
Europe. She had spent two years abroad after her first success in
<i>The Bretonne Maid</i>&mdash;a popular musical comedy in which
she had been mysteriously raised from obscurity to the rank of
"star"&mdash;and, one may cynically imagine, her press agent took
full advantage of her absence to circulate vermilion tales of her
conquests.</p>

<p>Her appearances went far toward sustaining her somewhat
equivocal fame. There was no question that she was beautiful in a
hard, slightly flamboyant way. I remember seeing her dancing one
night at the Antlers Club&mdash;a famous rendezvous for
postmidnight pleasure-seekers, run by the notorious Red Raegan.*
She impressed me then as a girl of uncommon loveliness, despite the
calculating, predatory cast of her features. She was of medium
height, slender, graceful in a leonine way, and, I thought, a
trifle aloof and even haughty in manner&mdash;a result, perhaps, of
her reputed association with European royalty. She had the
traditional courtesan's full, red lips, and the wide, mongoose eyes
of Rossetti's "Blessed Damozel." There was in her face that strange
combination of sensual promise and spiritual renunciation with
which the painters of all ages have sought to endow their
conceptions of the Eternal Magdalene. Hers was the type of face,
voluptuous and with a hint of mystery, which rules man's emotions
and, by subjugating his mind, drives him to desperate deeds.</p>

<p>* The Antlers Club has since been closed by the police; and Red
Raegan is now serving a long term in Sing Sing for grand
larceny.</p>

<p>Margaret Odell had received the sobriquet of Canary as a result
of a part she had played in an elaborate ornithological ballet of
the <i>Follies,</i> in which each girl had been gowned to represent
a variety of bird. To her had fallen the role of canary; and her
costume of white and yellow satin, together with her mass of
shining golden hair and pink and white complexion, had
distinguished her in the eyes of the spectators as a creature of
outstanding charm. Before a fortnight had passed&mdash;so
eulogistic were her press notices, and so unerringly did the
audience single her out for applause&mdash;the "Bird Ballet" was
changed to the "Canary Ballet," and Miss Odell was promoted to the
rank of what might charitably be called <i>premiere danseuse,</i>
at the same time having a solo waltz and a song* interpolated for
the special display of her charms and talents.</p>

<p>* Written especially for her by B. G. De Sylva.</p>

<p>She had quitted the <i>Follies</i> at the close of the season,
and during her subsequent spectacular career in the haunts of
Broadway's night life she had been popularly and familiarly called
the Canary. Thus it happened that when her dead body was found,
brutally strangled, in her apartment, the crime immediately became
known, and was always thereafter referred to, as the Canary
murder.</p>

<p>My own participation in the investigation of the Canary murder
case&mdash;or rather my role of Boswellian
spectator&mdash;constituted one of the most memorable experiences
of my life. At the time of Margaret Odell's murder John F.-X.
Markham was district attorney of New York, having taken office the
preceding January. I need hardly remind you that during the four
years of his incumbency he distinguished himself by his almost
uncanny success as a criminal investigator. The praise which was
constantly accorded him, however, was highly distasteful to him;
for, being a man with a keen sense of honor, he instinctively
shrank from accepting credit for achievements not wholly his own.
The truth is that Markham played only a subsidiary part in the
majority of his most famous criminal cases. The credit for their
actual solution belonged to one of Markham's very close friends,
who refused, at the time, to permit the facts to be made
public.</p>

<p>This man was a young social aristocrat, whom, for purposes of
anonymity, I have chosen to call Philo Vance.</p>

<p>Vance had many amazing gifts and capabilities. He was an art
collector in a small way, a fine amateur pianist, and a profound
student of aesthetics and psychology. Although an American, he had
largely been educated in Europe, and still retained a slight
English accent and intonation. He had a liberal independent income,
and spent considerable time fulfilling the social obligations which
devolved on him as a result of family connections; but he was
neither an idler nor a dilettante. His manner was cynical and
aloof; and those who met him only casually set him down as a snob.
But knowing Vance, as I did, intimately, I was able to glimpse the
real man beneath the surface indications; and I knew that his
cynicism and aloofness, far from being a pose, sprang instinctively
from a nature which was at once sensitive and solitary.</p>

<p>Vance was not yet thirty-five, and, in a cold, sculptural
fashion, was impressively good-looking. His face was slender and
mobile; but there was a stern, sardonic expression to his features,
which acted as a barrier between him and his fellows. He was not
emotionless, but his emotions were, in the main, intellectual. He
was often criticized for his asceticism, yet I have seen him
exhibit rare bursts of enthusiasm over an aesthetic or
psychological problem. However, he gave the impression of remaining
remote from all mundane matters; and, in truth, he looked upon life
like a dispassionate and impersonal spectator at a play, secretly
amused and debonairly cynical at the meaningless futility of it
all. Withal, he had a mind avid for knowledge, and few details of
the human comedy that came within his sphere of vision escaped
him.</p>

<p>It was as a direct result of this intellectual inquisitiveness
that he became actively, though unofficially, interested in
Markham's criminal investigations.</p>

<p>I kept a fairly complete record of the cases in which Vance
participated as a kind of <i>amicus curiae,</i> little thinking
that I would ever be privileged to make them public; but Markham,
after being defeated, as you remember, on a hopelessly split ticket
at the next election, withdrew from politics; and last year Vance
went abroad to live, declaring he would never return to America. As
a result, I obtained permission from both of them to publish my
notes in full. Vance stipulated only that I should not reveal his
name; but otherwise no restrictions were placed upon me.</p>

<p>I have related elsewhere* the peculiar circumstances which led
to Vance's participation in criminal research, and how, in the face
of almost insuperable contradictory evidence, he solved the
mysterious shooting of Alvin Benson. The present chronical deals
with his solution of Margaret Odell's murder, which took place in
the early fall of the same year, and which, you will recall,
created an even greater sensation than its predecessor.#</p>

<p>* "The Benson Murder Case"</p>

<p># The Loeb-Leopold crime, the Dorothy King case, and the
Hall-Mills murder came later; but the Canary murder proved fully as
conspicuous a case as the Nan Patterson-"Caesar" Young affair,
Durant's murder of Blanche Lamont and Minnie Williams in San
Francisco, the Molineux arsenic-poisoning case, and the Carlyle
Harris morphine murder. To find a parallel in point of public
interest one must recall the Borden double-murder in Fall River,
the Thaw case, the shooting of Elwell, and the Rosenthal
murder.</p>

<p>A curious set of circumstances was accountable for the way in
which Vance was shouldered with this new investigation. Markham for
weeks had been badgered by the antiadministration newspapers for
the signal failures of his office in obtaining convictions against
certain underworld offenders whom the police had turned over to him
for prosecution. As a result of prohibition a new and dangerous,
and wholly undesirable, kind of night life had sprung up in New
York. A large number of well-financed cabarets, calling themselves
nightclubs, had made their appearance along Broadway and in its
side streets; and already there had been an appalling number of
serious crimes, both passional and monetary, which, it was said,
had had their inception in these unsavory resorts.</p>

<p>At last, when a case of murder accompanying a holdup and jewel
robbery in one of the family hotels uptown was traced directly to
plans and preparations made in one of the nightclubs, and when two
detectives of the Homicide Bureau investigating the case were found
dead one morning in the neighborhood of the club, with bullet
wounds in their backs, Markham decided to pigeonhole the other
affairs of his office and take a hand personally in the intolerable
criminal conditions that had arisen.*</p>

<p>* The case referred to here was that of Mrs. Elinor Quiggly, a
wealthy widow living at the Adlon Hotel in West 96th Street. She
was found on the morning of September 5 suffocated by a gag which
had been placed on her by robbers who had evidently followed her
home from the Club Turque&mdash;a small but luxurious all-night
cafe at 89 West 48th Street. The killing of the two detectives,
McQuade and Cannison, was, the police believe, due to the fact that
they were in possession of incriminating evidence against the
perpetrators of the crime. Jewelry amounting to over $50,000 was
stolen from the Quiggly apartment.</p>

<h2>2 - FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW</h2>

<p><i>(Sunday, September 9)</i>
</p>

<p>On the day following his decision, Markham and Vance and I were
sitting in a secluded corner of the lounge room of the Stuyvesant
Club. We often came together there, for we were all members of the
club, and Markham frequently used it as a kind of unofficial uptown
headquarters.*</p>

<p>* The Stuyvesant was a large club, somewhat in the nature of a
glorified hotel; and its extensive membership was drawn largely
from the political, legal, and financial ranks.</p>

<p>"It's bad enough to have half the people in this city under the
impression that the district attorney's office is a kind of
high-class collection agency," he remarked that night, "without
being necessitated to turn detective because I'm not given
sufficient evidence, or the right kind of evidence, with which to
secure convictions."</p>

<p>Vance looked up with a slow smile and regarded him
quizzically.</p>

<p>"The difficulty would seem to be," he returned, with an indolent
drawl, "that the police, being unversed in the exquisite
abracadabra of legal procedure, labor under the notion that
evidence which would convince a man of ordin'ry intelligence, would
also convince a court of law. A silly notion, don't y' know.
Lawyers don't really want evidence; they want erudite
technicalities. And the average policeman's brain is too forthright
to cope with the pedantic demands of jurisprudence."</p>

<p>"It's not as bad as that," Markham retorted, with an attempt at
good nature, although the strain of the past few weeks had tended
to upset his habitual equanimity. "If there weren't rules of
evidence, grave injustice would too often be done innocent persons.
And even a criminal is entitled to protection in our courts."</p>

<p>Vance yawned mildly.</p>

<p>"Markham, you should have been a pedagogue. It's positively
amazin' how you've mastered all the standard oratorical replies to
criticism. And yet, I'm unconvinced. You remember the Wisconsin
case of the kidnapped man whom the courts declared presumably dead.
Even when he reappeared, hale and hearty, among his former
neighbors, his status of being presumably dead was not legally
altered. The visible and demonstrable fact that he was actually
alive was regarded by the court as an immaterial and impertinent
side issue.*...Then there's the touchin' situation&mdash;so
prevalent in this fair country&mdash;of a man being insane in one
state and sane in another...Really, y' know, you can't expect a
mere lay intelligence, unskilled in the benign processes of legal
logic, to perceive such subtle nuances. Your layman, swaddled in
the darkness of ordin'ry common sense, would say that a person who
is a lunatic on one bank of a river would still be a lunatic if he
was on the opposite bank. And he'd also hold&mdash;erroneously, no
doubt&mdash;that if a man was living, he would presumably be
alive."</p>

<p>* The case to which Vance referred, I ascertained later, was
Shatterham <i>v</i>. Shatterham, 417 Mich., 79&mdash;a testamentary
case.</p>

<p>"Why this academic dissertation?" asked Markham, this time a bit
irritably.</p>

<p>"It seems to touch rather vitally on the source of your present
predicament," Vance explained equably. "The police, not being
lawyers, have apparently got you into hot water, what?...Why not
start an agitation to send all detectives to law school?"</p>

<p>"You're a great help," retorted Markham.</p>

<p>Vance raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

<p>"Why disparage my suggestion? Surely you must perceive that it
has merit. A man without legal training, when he knows a thing to
be true, ignores all incompetent testimony to the contr'ry, and
clings to the facts. A court of law listens solemnly to a mass of
worthless testimony, and renders a decision not on the facts but
according to a complicated set of rules. The result, d' ye see, is
that a court often acquits a prisoner, realizing full well that he
is guilty. Many a judge has said, in effect, to a culprit, 'I know,
and the jury knows, that you committed the crime, but in view of
the legally admissible evidence, I declare you innocent. Go and sin
again.'"</p>

<p>Markham grunted. "I'd hardly endear myself to the people of this
country if I answered the current strictures against me by
recommending law courses for the police department."</p>

<p>"Permit me, then, to suggest the alternative of Shakespeare's
butcher: 'Let's kill all the lawyers.'"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it's a situation, not a utopian theory, that has
to be met."</p>

<p>"And just how," asked Vance lazily, "do you propose to reconcile
the sensible conclusions of the police with what you touchingly
call correctness of legal procedure?"</p>

<p>"To begin with," Markham informed him, "I've decided henceforth
to do my own investigating of all important nightclub criminal
cases. I called a conference of the heads of my departments
yesterday, and from now on there's going to be some real activity
radiating direct from my office. I intend to produce the kind of
evidence I need for convictions."</p>

<p>Vance slowly took a cigarette from his case and tapped it on the
arm of his chair. "Ah! So you are going to substitute the
conviction of the innocent for the acquittal of the guilty?"</p>

<p>Markham was nettled; turning in his chair, he frowned at Vance.
"I won't pretend not to understand your remark," he said
acidulously. "You're back again on your favorite theme of the
inadequacy of circumstantial evidence as compared with your
psychological theories and aesthetic hypotheses."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed Vance carelessly. "Y' know, Markham, your
sweet and charmin' faith in circumstantial evidence is positively
disarming. Before it, the ordin'ry powers of ratiocination are
benumbed. I tremble for the innocent victims you are about to
gather into your legal net. You'll eventually make the mere
attendance at any cabaret a frightful hazard."</p>

<p>Markham smoked awhile in silence. Despite the seeming bitterness
at times in the discussions of these two men, there was at bottom
no animosity in their attitude toward each other. Their friendship
was of long standing, and, despite the dissimilarity of their
temperaments and the marked difference in their points of view, a
profound mutual respect formed the basis of their intimate
relationship.</p>

<p>At length Markham spoke. "Why this sweeping deprecation of
circumstantial evidence? I admit that at times it may be
misleading; but it often forms powerful presumptive proof of guilt.
Indeed, Vance, one of our greatest legal authorities has
demonstrated that it is the most powerful actual evidence in
existence. Direct evidence, in the very nature of crime, is almost
always unavailable. If the courts had to depend on it, the great
majority of criminals would still be at large."</p>

<p>"I was under the impression that this precious majority had
always enjoyed its untrammeled freedom."</p>

<p>Markham ignored the interruption. "Take this example: A dozen
adults see an animal running across the snow, and testify that it
was a chicken; whereas a child sees the same animal, and declares
it was a duck. They thereupon examine the animal's footprints and
find them to be the webfooted tracks made by a duck. Is it not
conclusive, then, that the animal was a duck and not a chicken,
despite the preponderance of direct evidence?"</p>

<p>"I'll grant you your duck," acceded Vance indifferently.</p>

<p>"And having gratefully accepted the gift," pursued Markham, "I
propound a corollary: A dozen adults see a human figure crossing
the snow, and take oath it was a woman; whereas a child asserts
that the figure was a man. Now, will you not also grant that the
circumstantial evidence of a man's footprints in the snow would
supply incontrovertible proof that it was, in fact, a man, and not
a woman?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, my dear Justinian," replied Vance, stretching his
legs languidly in front of him; "unless, of course, you could show
that a human being possesses no higher order of brain than a
duck."</p>

<p>"What have brains to do with it?" Markham asked impatiently.
"Brains don't affect one's footprints."</p>

<p>"Not those of a duck, certainly. But brains might very
well&mdash;and, no doubt, often do&mdash;affect the footprints of a
human being."</p>

<p>"Am I having a lesson in anthropology, Darwinian adaptability,
or merely metaphysical speculation?"</p>

<p>"In none of those abstruse subjects," Vance assured him. "I'm
merely stating a simple fact culled from observation."</p>

<p>"Well, according to your highly and peculiarly developed
processes of reasoning, would the circumstantial evidence of those
masculine footprints indicate a man or a woman?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily either," Vance answered, "or, rather, a
possibility of each. Such evidence, when applied to a human
being&mdash;to a creature, that is, with a reasoning
mind&mdash;would merely mean to me that the figure crossing the
snow was either a man in his own shoes or a woman in man's shoes;
or perhaps, even, a long-legged child. In short, it would convey to
my purely unlegal intelligence only that the tracks were made by
some descendant of the <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> wearing men's
shoes on his nether limbs&mdash;sex and age unknown. A duck's
spoors, on the other hand, I might be tempted to take at their face
value."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to observe," said Markham, "that at least you
repudiate the possibility of a duck dressing itself up in the
gardener's boots."</p>

<p>Vance was silent for a moment; then he said, "The trouble with
you modern Solons, d' ye see, is that you attempt to reduce human
nature to a formula; whereas the truth is that man, like life, is
infinitely complex. He's shrewd and tricky&mdash;skilled for
centuries in all the most diabolical chicaneries. He is a creature
of low cunning, who, even in the normal course of his vain and
idiotic struggle for existence, instinctively and deliberately
tells ninety-nine lies to one truth. A duck, not having had the
heaven-kissing advantages of human civilization, is a
straightforward and eminently honest bird."</p>

<p>"How," asked Markham, "since you jettison all the ordinary means
of arriving at a conclusion, would you decide the sex or species of
this person who left the masculine footprints in the snow?"</p>

<p>Vance blew a spiral of smoke toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>"First, I'd repudiate all the evidence of the twelve astigmatic
adults and the one bright-eyed child. Next, I'd ignore the
footprints in the snow. Then, with a mind unprejudiced by dubious
testimony and uncluttered with material clues, I'd determine the
exact nature of the crime which this fleeing person had committed.
After having analyzed its various factors, I could infallibly tell
you not only whether the culprit was a man or a woman, but I could
describe his habits, character, and personality. And I could do all
this whether the fleeing figure left male or female or kangaroo
tracks, or used stilts, or rode off on a velocipede, or levitated
without leaving tracks at all."</p>

<p>Markham smiled broadly. "You'd be worse than the police in the
matter of supplying me legal evidence, I fear."</p>

<p>"I, at least, wouldn't procure evidence against some
unsuspecting person whose boots had been appropriated by the real
culprit," retorted Vance. "And, y' know, Markham, as long as you
pin your faith to footprints, you'll inevitably arrest just those
persons whom the actual criminals want you to&mdash;namely, persons
who have had nothing to do with the criminal conditions you're
about to investigate."</p>

<p>He became suddenly serious.</p>

<p>"See here, old man; there are some shrewd intelligences at
present allied with what the theologians call the powers of
darkness. The surface appearances of many of these crimes that are
worrying you are palpably deceptive. Personally, I don't put much
stock in the theory that a malevolent gang of cutthroats have
organized an American camorra and made the silly nightclubs their
headquarters. The idea is too melodramatic. It smacks too much of
the gaudy journalistic imagination; it's too Eug&egrave;ne Sue-ish.
Crime isn't a mass instinct except during wartime, and then it's
merely an obscene sport. Crime, d' ye see, is a personal and
individual business. One doesn't make up a <i>partie
car&eacute;e</i> for a murder as one does for a bridge
game...Markham, old dear, don't let this romantic criminological
idea lead you astray. And don't scrutinize the figurative
footprints in the snow too closely. They'll confuse you most
horribly&mdash;you're far too trustin' and literal for this wicked
world. I warn you that no clever criminal is going to leave his own
footprints for your tape measure and calipers."</p>

<p>He sighed deeply and gave Markham a look of bantering
commiseration. "And have you paused to consider that your first
case may even be devoid of footprints?...Alas! What, then, will you
do?"</p>

<p>"I could overcome that difficulty by taking you along with me,"
suggested Markham, with a touch of irony. "How would you like to
accompany me on the next important case that breaks?"</p>

<p>"I am ravished by the idea," said Vance.</p>

<p>Two days later the front pages of our metropolitan press carried
glaring headlines telling of the murder of Margaret Odell.</p>

<h2>3 - THE MURDER</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 11; 8:30 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>It was barely half past eight on that momentous morning of
September the 11th when Markham brought word to us of the
event.</p>

<p>I was living temporarily with Vance at his home in East 38th
Street&mdash;a large remodeled apartment occupying the two top
floors of a beautiful mansion. For several years I had been Vance's
personal legal representative and adviser, having resigned from my
father's law firm of Van Dine, Davis, and Van Dine to devote myself
to his needs and interests. His affairs were by no means
voluminous, but his personal finances, together with his numerous
purchases of paintings and <i>objets d'art,</i> occupied my full
time without burdening me. This monetary and legal stewardship was
eminently congenial to my tastes; and my friendship with Vance,
which had dated from our undergraduate days at Harvard, supplied
the social and human element in an arrangement which otherwise
might easily have degenerated into one of mere drab routine.</p>

<p>On this particular morning I had risen early and was working in
the library when Currie, Vance's valet and majordomo, announced
Markham's presence in the living room. I was considerably
astonished at this early morning visit, for Markham well knew that
Vance, who rarely rose before noon, resented any intrusion upon his
matutinal slumbers. And in that moment I received the curious
impression that something unusual and portentous was toward.</p>

<p>I found Markham pacing restlessly up and down, his hat and
gloves thrown carelessly on the center table. As I entered he
halted and looked at me with harassed eyes. He was a moderately
tall man, clean-shaven, gray-haired, and firmly set up. His
appearance was distinguished, and his manner courteous and kindly.
But beneath his gracious exterior there was an aggressive
sternness, an indomitable, grim strength, that gave one the sense
of dogged efficiency and untiring capability.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Van," he greeted me, with impatient
perfunctoriness. "There's been another half-world murder&mdash;the
worst and ugliest thus far..." He hesitated and regarded me
searchingly. "You recall my chat with Vance at the club the other
night? There was something damned prophetic in his remarks. And you
remember I half promised to take him along on the next important
case. Well, the case has broken&mdash;with a vengeance. Margaret
Odell, whom they called the Canary, has been strangled in her
apartment; and from what I just got over the phone, it looks like
another nightclub affair. I'm headed for the Odell apartment
now...What about rousing out the sybarite?"</p>

<p>"By all means," I agreed, with an alacrity which, I fear, was in
large measure prompted by purely selfish motives. The Canary! If
one had sought the city over for a victim whose murder would stir
up excitement, there could have been but few selections better
calculated to produce this result.</p>

<p>Hastening to the door, I summoned Currie and told him to call
Vance at once.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, sir&mdash;" began Currie, politely hesitant.</p>

<p>"Calm your fears," cut in Markham. "I'll take all responsibility
for waking him at this indecent hour."</p>

<p>Currie sensed an emergency and departed.</p>

<p>A minute or two later Vance, in an elaborately embroidered silk
kimono and sandals, appeared at the living room door.</p>

<p>"My word!" he greeted us, in mild astonishment, glancing at the
clock. "Haven't you chaps gone to bed yet?"</p>

<p>He strolled to the mantel and selected a gold-tipped
R&eacute;gie cigarette from a small Florentine humidor.</p>

<p>Markham's eyes narrowed; he was in no mood for levity.</p>

<p>"The Canary has been murdered," I blurted out.</p>

<p>Vance held his wax vesta poised and gave me a look of indolent
inquisitiveness. "Whose canary?"</p>

<p>"Margaret Odell was found strangled this morning," amended
Markham brusquely. "Even <i>you</i><i>,</i> wrapped in your scented
cotton-wool, have heard of her. And you can realize the
significance of the crime. I'm personally going to look for those
footprints in the snow; and if you want to come along, as you
intimated the other night, you'll have to get a move on."</p>

<p>Vance crushed out his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Margaret Odell, eh?&mdash;Broadway's blond Aspasia&mdash;or was
it Phryne who had the <i>coiffure d'or?</i>...Most distressin'!"
Despite his offhand manner, I could see he was deeply interested.
"The base enemies of law and order are determined to chivvy you
most horribly, aren't they, old dear? Deuced inconsiderate of
'em!...Excuse me while I seek habiliments suitable to the
occasion."</p>

<p>He disappeared into his bedroom, while Markham took out a large
cigar and resolutely prepared it for smoking, and I returned to the
library to put away the papers on which I had been working.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes Vance reappeared, dressed for the
street.</p>

<p><i>"Bien, mon vieux,"</i> he announced gaily, as Currie handed
him his hat and gloves and a malacca cane. <i>"Allons-y!"</i></p>

<p>We rode uptown along Madison Avenue, turned into Central Park,
and came out by the West 72d Street entrance. Margaret Odell's
apartment was at 184 West 71st Street, near Broadway; and as we
drew up to the curb, it was necessary for the patrolman on duty to
make a passage for us through the crowd that had already gathered
as a result of the arrival of the police.</p>

<p>Feathergill, an assistant district attorney, was waiting in the
main hall for his chief's arrival.</p>

<p>"It's too bad, sir," he lamented. "A rotten show all round. And
just at this time!..." He shrugged his shoulders
discouragingly.</p>

<p>"It may collapse quickly," said Markham, shaking the other's
hand. "How are things going? Sergeant Heath phoned me right after
you called, and said that, at first glance, the case looked a bit
stubborn."</p>

<p>"Stubborn?" repeated Feathergill lugubriously. "It's downright
impervious. Heath is spinning round like a turbine. He was called
off the Boyle case, by the way, to devote his talents to this new
shocker. Inspector Moran arrived ten minutes ago and gave him the
official imprimatur."</p>

<p>"Well, Heath's a good man," declared Markham. "We'll work it
out...Which is the apartment?"</p>

<p>Feathergill led the way to a door at the rear of the main hall.
"Here you are, sir," he announced. "I'll be running along now. I
need sleep. Good luck!" And he was gone.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to give a brief description of the house
and its interior arrangement, for the somewhat peculiar structure
of the building played a vital part in the seemingly insoluble
problem posed by the murder.</p>

<p>The house, which was a four-story stone structure originally
built as a residence, had been remodeled, both inside and outside,
to meet the requirements of an exclusive individual apartment
dwelling. There were, I believe, three or four separate suites on
each floor; but the quarters upstairs need not concern us. The main
floor was the scene of the crime, and here there were three
apartments and a dentist's office.</p>

<p>The main entrance to the building was directly on the street,
and extending straight back from the front door was a wide hallway.
Directly at the rear of this hallway, and facing the entrance, was
the door to the Odell apartment, which bore the numeral "3." About
halfway down the front hall, on the right-hand side, was the
stairway leading to the floors above; and directly beyond the
stairway, also on the right, was a small reception room with a wide
archway instead of a door. Directly opposite to the stairway, in a
small recess, stood the telephone switchboard. There was no
elevator in the house.</p>

<p>Another important feature of this ground-floor plan was a small
passageway at the rear of the main hall and at right angles to it,
which led past the front walls of the Odell apartment to a door
opening on a court at the west side of the building. This court was
connected with the street by an alley four feet wide.</p>

<p>In the accompanying diagram this arrangement of the ground floor
can be easily visualized, and I suggest that the reader fix it in
his mind; for I doubt if ever before so simple and obvious an
architectural design played such an important part in a criminal
mystery. By its very simplicity and almost conventional
familiarity&mdash;indeed, by its total lack of any puzzling
complications&mdash;it proved so baffling to the investigators that
the case threatened, for many days, to remain forever
insoluble.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="0200351h-01.gif">
</p>

<p>As Markham entered the Odell apartment that morning Sergeant
Ernest Heath came forward at once and extended his hand. A look of
relief passed over his broad, pugnacious features and it was
obvious that the animosity and rivalry which always exist between
the detective division and the district attorney's office during
the investigation of any criminal case had no place in his attitude
on this occasion.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come, sir," he said, and meant it.</p>

<p>He then turned to Vance with a cordial smile, and held out his
hand.*</p>

<p>* Heath had become acquainted with Vance during the
investigation of the Benson murder case two months previously.</p>

<p>"So the amachoor sleuth is with us again!" His tone held a
friendly banter.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," murmured Vance. "How's your induction coil working
this beautiful September morning, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"I'd hate to tell you!" Then Heath's face grew suddenly grave,
and he turned to Markham. "It's a raw deal, sir. Why in hell
couldn't they have picked someone besides the Canary for their
dirty work? There's plenty of Janes on Broadway who coulda faded
from the picture without causing a second alarm; but they gotta go
and bump off the Queen of Sheba!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, William M. Moran, the commanding officer of the
detective bureau, came into the little foyer and performed the
usual handshaking ceremony. Though he had met Vance and me but once
before, and then casually, he remembered us both and addressed us
courteously by name.</p>

<p>"Your arrival," he said to Markham, in a well-bred, modulated
voice, "is very welcome. Sergeant Heath will give you what
preliminary information you want. I'm still pretty much in the dark
myself&mdash;only just arrived."</p>

<p>"A lot of information <i>I've</i> got to give," grumbled Heath,
as he led the way into the living room.</p>

<p>Margaret Odell's apartment was a suite of two fairly large rooms
connected by a wide archway draped with heavy damask portieres. The
entrance door from the main hall of the building led into a small
rectangular foyer about eight feet long and four feet deep, with
double Venetian-glass doors opening into the main room beyond.
There was no other entrance to the apartment, and the bedroom could
be reached only through the archway from the living room.</p>

<p>There was a large davenport, covered with brocaded silk, in
front of the fireplace in the left-hand wall of the living room,
with a long narrow library table of inlaid rosewood extending along
its back. On the opposite wall, between the foyer and the archway
into the bedroom, hung a triplicate Marie Antoinette mirror,
beneath which stood a mahogany gate-legged table. On the far side
of the archway, near the large oriel window, was a baby grand
Steinway piano with a beautifully designed and decorated case of
Louis-Seize ornamentation. In the corner to the right of the
fireplace was a spindle-legged escritoire and a square hand-painted
wastepaper basket of vellum. To the left of the fireplace stood one
of the loveliest Boule cabinets I have ever seen. Several excellent
reproductions of Boucher, Fragonard, and Watteau hung about the
walls. The bedroom contained a chest of drawers, a dressing table,
and several gold-leaf chairs. The whole apartment seemed eminently
in keeping with the Canary's fragile and evanescent
personality.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="0200351h-02.gif">
</p>

<p>As we stepped from the little foyer into the living room and
stood for a moment looking about, a scene bordering on wreckage met
our eyes. The rooms had apparently been ransacked by someone in a
frenzy of haste, and the disorder of the place was appalling.</p>

<p>"They didn't exactly do the job in dainty fashion," remarked
Inspector Moran.</p>

<p>"I suppose we oughta be grateful they didn't blow the joint up
with dynamite," returned Heath acridly.</p>

<p>But it was not the general disorder that most attracted us. Our
gaze was almost immediately drawn and held by the body of the dead
girl, which rested in an unnatural, semirecumbent attitude in the
corner of the davenport nearest to where we stood. Her head was
turned backward, as if by force, over the silken tufted upholstery;
and her hair had come unfastened and lay beneath her head and over
her bare shoulder like a frozen cataract of liquid gold. Her face,
in violent death, was distorted and unlovely. Her skin was
discolored; her eyes were staring; her mouth was open, and her lips
were drawn back. Her neck, on either side of the thyroid cartilage,
showed ugly dark bruises. She was dressed in a flimsy evening gown
of black Chantilly lace over cream-colored chiffon, and across the
arm of the davenport had been thrown an evening cape of
cloth-of-gold trimmed with ermine.</p>

<p>There were evidences of her ineffectual struggle with the person
who had strangled her. Besides the disheveled condition of her
hair, one of the shoulder straps of her gown had been severed, and
there was a long rent in the fine lace across her breast. A small
corsage of artificial orchids had been torn from her bodice, and
lay crumpled in her lap. One satin slipper had fallen off, and her
right knee was twisted inward on the seat of the davenport, as if
she had sought to lift herself out of the suffocating clutches of
her antagonist. Her fingers were still flexed, no doubt as they had
been at the moment of her capitulation to death, when she had
relinquished her grip upon the murderer's wrists.</p>

<p>The spell of horror cast over us by the sight of the tortured
body was broken by the matter-of-fact tones of Heath.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Markham, she was evidently sitting in the corner
of this settee when she was grabbed suddenly from behind."</p>

<p>Markham nodded. "It must have taken a pretty strong man to
strangle her so easily."</p>

<p>"I'll say!" agreed Heath. He bent over and pointed to the girl's
fingers, on which showed several abrasions. "They stripped her
rings off, too; and they didn't go about it gentle, either." Then
he indicated a segment of fine platinum chain, set with tiny
pearls, which hung over one of her shoulders. "And they grabbed
whatever it was hanging around her neck, and broke the chain doing
it. They weren't overlooking anything, or losing any time...A
swell, gentlemanly job. Nice and refined."</p>

<p>"Where's the medical examiner?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>"He's coming," Heath told him. "You can't get Doc Doremus to go
anywheres without his breakfast."</p>

<p>"He may find something else&mdash;something that doesn't
show."</p>

<p>"There's plenty showing for me," declared Heath. "Look at this
apartment. It wouldn't be much worse if a Kansas cyclone had struck
it."</p>

<p>We turned from the depressing spectacle of the dead girl and
moved toward the center of the room.</p>

<p>"Be careful not to touch anything, Mr. Markham," warned Heath.
"I've sent for the fingerprint experts&mdash;they'll be here any
minute now."</p>

<p>Vance looked up in mock astonishment.</p>

<p>"Fingerprints? You don't say&mdash;really! How
delightful!&mdash;Imagine a johnnie in this enlightened day leaving
his fingerprints for you to find."</p>

<p>"All crooks aren't clever, Mr. Vance," declared Heath
combatively.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! They'd never be apprehended if they were. But,
after all, Sergeant, even an authentic fingerprint merely means
that the person who made it was dallying around at some time or
other. It doesn't indicate guilt."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," conceded Heath doggedly. "But I'm here to tell you
that if I get any good honest-to-God fingerprints outa this
devastated area, it's not going so easy with the bird that made
'em."</p>

<p>Vance appeared to be shocked. "You positively terrify me,
Sergeant. Henceforth I shall adopt mittens as a permanent addition
to my attire. I'm always handling the furniture and the teacups and
the various knickknacks in the houses where I call, don't y'
know."</p>

<p>Markham interposed himself at this point and suggested they make
a tour of inspection while waiting for the medical examiner.</p>

<p>"They didn't add anything much to the usual methods," Heath
pointed out. "Killed the girl, and then ripped things wide
open."</p>

<p>The two rooms had apparently been thoroughly ransacked. Clothes
and various articles were strewn about the floor. The doors of both
clothes closets (there was one in each room) were open, and to
judge from the chaos in the bedroom closet, it had been hurriedly
searched; although the closet off the living room, which was given
over to the storage of infrequently used items, appeared to have
been ignored. The drawers of the dressing table and chest had been
partly emptied on to the floor, and the bedclothes had been
snatched away and the mattress turned back. Two chairs and a small
occasional table were upset; several vases were broken, as if they
had been searched and then thrown down in the wrath of
disappointment; and the Marie Antoinette mirror had been broken.
The escritoire was open, and its pigeonholes had been emptied in a
jumbled pile upon the blotter. The doors of the Boule cabinet swung
wide, and inside there was the same confusion of contents that
marked the interior of the escritoire. The bronze-and-porcelain
lamp on the end of the library table was lying on its side, its
satin shade torn where it had struck the sharp corner of a silver
bonbonni&egrave;re.</p>

<p>Two objects in the general disarray particularly attracted my
attention&mdash;a black metal document box of the kind purchasable
at any stationery store, and a large jewel case of sheet steel with
a circular inset lock. The latter of these objects was destined to
play a curious and sinister part in the investigation to
follow.</p>

<p>The document box, which was now empty, had been placed on the
library table, next to the overturned lamp. Its lid was thrown
back, and the key was still in the lock. In all the litter and
disorganization of the room, this box seemed to be the one
outstanding indication of calm and orderly activity on the part of
the wrecker.</p>

<p>The jewel case, on the other hand, had been violently wrenched
open. It sat on the dressing table in the bedroom, dented and
twisted out of shape by the terrific leverage that had been
necessary to force it, and beside it lay a brass-handled, cast iron
poker which had evidently been brought from the living room and
used as a makeshift chisel with which to prize open the lock.</p>

<p>Vance had glanced but casually at the different objects in the
rooms as we made our rounds, but when he came to the dressing
table, he paused abruptly. Taking out his monocle, he adjusted it
carefully, and leaned over the broken jewel case.</p>

<p>"Most extr'ordin'ry!" he murmured, tapping the edge of the lid
with his gold pencil. "What do you make of that, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath had been eyeing Vance with narrowed lids as the latter
bent over the dressing table.</p>

<p>"What's in your mind, Mr. Vance?" he, in turn, asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, more than you could ever guess," Vance answered lightly.
"But just at the moment I was toying with the idea that this steel
case was never torn open by that wholly inadequate iron poker,
what?"</p>

<p>Heath nodded his head approvingly. "So you, too, noticed that,
did you?...And you're dead right. That poker might've twisted the
box a little, but it never snapped that lock."</p>

<p>He turned to Inspector Moran.</p>

<p>"That's the puzzler I've sent for 'Prof' Brenner to clean
up&mdash;<i>if</i> he can. The jimmying of that jewel case looks to
me like a high-class professional job. No Sunday school
superintendent did it."</p>

<p>Vance continued for a while to study the box, but at length he
turned away with a perplexed frown.</p>

<p>"I say!" he commented. "Something devilish queer took place here
last night."</p>

<p>"Oh, not so queer," Heath amended. "It was a thorough job, all
right, but there's nothing mysterious about it."</p>

<p>Vance polished his monocle and put it away.</p>

<p>"If you go to work on that basis, Sergeant," he returned
carelessly, "I greatly fear you'll run aground on a reef. And may
kind Heaven bring you safe to shore!"</p>

<h2>4 - THE PRINT OF A HAND</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 11, 9:30 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>A few minutes after we had returned to the living room Doctor
Doremus, the chief medical examiner, arrived, jaunty and energetic.
Immediately in his train came three other men, one of whom carried
a bulky camera and a folded tripod. These were Captain Dubois and
Detective Bellamy, fingerprint experts, and Peter Quackenbush, the
official photographer.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" exclaimed Doctor Doremus. "Quite a gathering
of the clans. More trouble, eh?...I wish your friends, Inspector,
would choose a more respectable hour for their little differences.
This early rising upsets my liver."</p>

<p>He shook hands with everybody in a brisk, businesslike
manner.</p>

<p>"Where's the body?" he demanded breezily, looking about the
room. He caught sight of the girl on the davenport. "Ah! A
lady."</p>

<p>Stepping quickly forward, he made a rapid examination of the
dead girl, scrutinizing her neck and fingers, moving her arms and
head to determine the condition of <i>rigor mortis,</i> and finally
unflexing her stiffened limbs and laying her out straight on the
long cushions, preparatory to a more detailed necropsy.</p>

<p>The rest of us moved toward the bedroom, and Heath motioned to
the fingerprint men to follow.</p>

<p>"Go over everything," he told them. "But take a special look at
this jewel case and the handle of this poker, and give that
document box in the other room a close
up&mdash;and&mdash;down."</p>

<p>"Right," assented Captain Dubois. "We'll begin in here while the
doc's busy in the other room." And he and Bellamy set to work.</p>

<p>Our interest naturally centered on the captain's labors. For
fully five minutes we watched him inspecting the twisted steel
sides of the jewel case and the smooth, polished handle of the
poker. He held the objects gingerly by their edges, and, placing a
jeweler's glass in his eye, flashed his pocket light on every
square inch of them. At length he put them down, scowling.</p>

<p>"No fingerprints here," he announced. "Wiped clean."</p>

<p>"I mighta known it," grumbled Heath. "It was a professional job,
all right." He turned to the other expert. "Found anything,
Bellamy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to help," was the grumpy reply. "A few old smears with
dust over 'em."</p>

<p>"Looks like a washout," Heath commented irritably; "though I'm
hoping for something in the other room."</p>

<p>At this moment Doctor Doremus came into the bedroom and, taking
a sheet from the bed, returned to the davenport and covered the
body of the murdered girl. Then he snapped shut his case and,
putting on his hat at a rakish angle, stepped forward with the air
of a man in great haste to be on his way.</p>

<p>"Simple case of strangulation from behind," he said, his words
running together. "Digital bruises about the front of the throat;
thumb bruises in the suboccipital region. Attack must have been
unexpected. A quick, competent job though deceased evidently
battled a little."</p>

<p>"How do you suppose her dress became torn, Doctor?" asked
Vance.</p>

<p>"Oh, that? Can't tell. She may have done it
herself&mdash;instinctive motions of clutching for air."</p>

<p>"Not likely though, what?"</p>

<p>"Why not? The dress was torn and the bouquet was ripped off, and
the fellow who was choking her had both hands on her throat. Who
else could've done it?"</p>

<p>Vance shrugged his shoulders and began lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>Heath, annoyed by his apparently inconsequential interruption,
put the next question.</p>

<p>"Don't those marks on the fingers mean that her rings were
stripped off?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. They're fresh abrasions. Also, there's a couple of
lacerations on the left wrist and slight contusions on the thenar
eminence, indicating that a bracelet may have been forcibly pulled
over her hand."</p>

<p>"That fits O.K.," pronounced Heath, with satisfaction. "And it
looks like they snatched a pendant of some kind off her neck."</p>

<p>"Probably," indifferently agreed Doctor Doremus. "The piece of
chain had cut into her flesh a little behind the right
shoulder."</p>

<p>"And the time?"</p>

<p>"Nine or ten hours ago. Say, about eleven thirty&mdash;maybe a
little before. Not after midnight, anyway." He had been teetering
restlessly on his toes. "Anything else?"</p>

<p>Heath pondered.</p>

<p>"I guess that's all, doc," he decided. "I'll get the body to the
mortuary right away. Let's have the postmortem as soon as you
can."</p>

<p>"You'll get a report in the morning." And despite his apparent
eagerness to be off, Doctor Doremus stepped into the bedroom and
shook hands with Heath and Markham and Inspector Moran before he
hurried out.</p>

<p>Heath followed him to the door, and I heard him direct the
officer outside to telephone the Department of Public Welfare to
send an ambulance at once for the girl's body.</p>

<p>"I positively adore that official archiater of yours," Vance
said to Markham. "Such detachment! Here are you stewing most
distressingly over the passing of one damsel fair and frail, and
that blithe <i>medicus</i> is worrying only over a sluggish liver
brought on by early rising."</p>

<p>"What has he to be upset over?" complained Markham. "The
newspapers are not riding him with spurs...And by the way, what was
the point of your questions about the torn dress?"</p>

<p>Vance lazily inspected the tip of his cigarette. "Consider," he
said. "The lady was evidently taken by surprise; for, had there
been a struggle beforehand, she would not have been strangled from
behind while sitting down. Therefore, her gown and corsage were
undoubtedly intact at the time she was seized. But, despite the
conclusion of your dashing Paracelsus, the damage to her toilet was
not of a nature that could have been self-inflicted in her struggle
for air. If she had felt the constriction of the gown across her
breast, she would have snatched the bodice itself by putting her
fingers inside the band. But, if you noticed, her bodice was
intact; the only thing that had been torn was the deep lace flounce
on the outside; and it had been torn, or rather ripped, by a strong
lateral pull; whereas, in the circumstances, any wrench on her part
would have been downward or outward."</p>

<p>Inspector Moran was listening intently, but Heath seemed
restless and impatient; apparently he regarded the torn gown as
irrelevant to the simple main issue.</p>

<p>"Moreover," Vance went on, "there is the corsage. If she herself
had torn it off while being strangled, it would doubtless have
fallen to the floor; for, remember, she offered considerable
resistance. Her body was twisted sidewise; her knee was drawn up,
and one slipper had been kicked off. Now, no bunch of silken posies
is going to remain in a lady's lap during such a commotion. Even
when ladies sit still, their gloves and handbags and handkerchiefs
and programs and serviettes are forever sliding off of their laps
onto the floor, don't y' know."</p>

<p>"But if your argument's correct," protested Markham, "then, the
tearing of the lace and the snatching off of the corsage could have
been done only after she was dead. And I can't see any object in
such senseless vandalism."</p>

<p>"Neither can I," sighed Vance. "It's all devilish queer."</p>

<p>Heath looked up at him sharply. "That's the second time you've
said that. But there's nothing what you'd call queer about this
mess. It is a straightaway case." He spoke with an overtone of
insistence, like a man arguing against his own insecurity of
opinion. "The dress might've been torn almost anytime," he went on
stubbornly. "And the flower might've got caught in the lace of her
skirt so it couldn't roll off."</p>

<p>"And how would you explain the jewel case, Sergeant?" asked
Vance.</p>

<p>"Well, the fellow might've tried the poker and then, finding it
wouldn't work, used his jimmy."</p>

<p>"If he had the efficient jimmy," countered Vance, "why did he go
to the trouble of bringing the silly poker from the living
room?"</p>

<p>The sergeant shook his head perplexedly.</p>

<p>"You never can tell why some of these crooks act the way they
do."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" Vance chided him. "There should be no such word as
<i>never</i> in the bright lexicon of detecting."</p>

<p>Heath regarded him sharply. "Was there anything else that struck
you as queer?" His subtle doubts were welling up again.</p>

<p>"Well, there's the lamp on the table in the other room."</p>

<p>We were standing near the archway between the two rooms, and
Heath turned quickly and looked blankly at the fallen lamp.</p>

<p>"I don t see anything queer about that."</p>

<p>"It has been upset&mdash;eh, what?" suggested Vance.</p>

<p>"What if it has?" Health was frankly puzzled. "Damn near
everything in this apartment has been knocked crooked."</p>

<p>"Ah! But there's a reason for most of the other things having
been disturbed&mdash;like the drawers and pigeonholes and closets
and vases. They all indicate a search; they're consistent with a
raid for loot. But that lamp, now, d' ye see, doesn't fit into the
picture. It's a false note. It was standing on the opposite end of
the table to where the murder was committed, at least five feet
away; and it couldn't possibly have been knocked over in the
struggle...No, it won't do. It's got no business being upset, any
more than that pretty mirror over the gate-legged table has any
business being broken. That's why it's queer."</p>

<p>"What about those chairs and the little table?" asked Heath,
pointing to two small gilded chairs which had been overturned, and
a fragile tip-table that lay on its side near the piano.</p>

<p>"Oh, they fit into the ensemble," returned Vance. "They're all
light pieces of furniture which could easily have been knocked
over, or thrown aside, by the hasty gentleman who rifled these
rooms."</p>

<p>"The lamp might've been knocked over in the same way," argued
Heath. Vance shook his head. "Not tenable, Sergeant. It has a solid
bronze base and isn't at all top-heavy; and, being set well back on
the table, it wasn't in anyone's way...That lamp was upset
deliberately."</p>

<p>The sergeant was silent for a while. Experience had taught him
not to underestimate Vance's observations; and, I must confess, as
I looked at the lamp lying on its side on the end of the library
table, well removed from any of the other disordered objects in the
room, Vance's argument seemed to possess considerable force. I
tried hard to fit it into a hasty reconstruction of the crime but
was utterly unable to do so.</p>

<p>"Anything else that don't seem to fit into the picture?" Heath
at length asked.</p>

<p>Vance pointed with his cigarette toward the clothes closet in
the living room. This closet was alongside of the foyer, in the
corner near the Boule cabinet, directly opposite to the end of the
davenport.</p>

<p>"You might let your mind dally a moment with the condition of
that clothes press," suggested Vance carelessly. "You will note
that, though the door's ajar, the contents have not been touched.
And it's about the only area in the apartment that hasn't been
disturbed."</p>

<p>Heath walked over and looked into the closet.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, I'll admit that's queer," he finally
conceded.</p>

<p>Vance had followed him indolently and stood gazing over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"And my word!" he exclaimed suddenly. "The key's on the inside
of the lock. Fancy that, now! One can't lock a closet door with the
key on the inside&mdash;can one, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"The key may not mean anything," Heath observed hopefully.
"Maybe the door was never locked. Anyhow, we'll find out about that
pretty soon. I'm holding the maid outside, and I'm going to have
her on the carpet as soon as the captain finishes his job
here."</p>

<p>He turned to Dubois, who, having completed his search for
fingerprints in the bedroom, was now inspecting the piano.</p>

<p>"Any luck yet?"</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"Gloves," he answered succinctly.</p>

<p>"Same here," supplemented Bellamy gruffly, on his knees before
the escritoire.</p>

<p>Vance, with a sardonic smile, turned and walked to the window,
where he stood looking out and smoking placidly, as if his entire
interest in the case had evaporated.</p>

<p>At this moment the door from the main hall opened, and a short,
thin little man, with gray hair and a scraggly gray beard, stepped
inside and stood blinking against the vivid sunlight.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Professor," Heath greeted the newcomer. "Glad to
see you. I've got something nifty, right in your line."</p>

<p>Deputy Inspector Conrad Brenner was one of that small army of
obscure, but highly capable, experts who are connected with the New
York Police Department, and who are constantly being consulted on
abstruse technical problems, but whose names and achievements
rarely get into the public prints. His specialty was locks and
burglars' tools; and I doubt if, even among those exhaustively
painstaking criminologists of the University of Lausanne, there was
a more accurate reader of the evidential signs left by the
implements of housebreakers. In appearance and bearing he was like
a withered little college professor.* His black, unpressed suit was
old-fashioned in cut; and he wore a very high stiff collar, like
<i>a fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> clergyman, with a narrow black string
tie. His gold-rimmed spectacles were so thick-lensed that the
pupils of his eyes gave the impression of acute belladonna
poisoning.</p>

<p>* It is an interesting fact that for the nineteen years he had
been connected with the New York Police Department, he had been
referred to, by his superiors and subordinates alike, as "the
Professor."</p>

<p>When Heath had spoken to him, he merely stood staring with a
sort of detached expectancy; he seemed utterly unaware that there
was anyone else in the room. The sergeant, evidently familiar with
the little man's idiosyncrasies of manner, did not wait for a
response, but started at once for the bedroom.</p>

<p>"This way, please, Professor," he directed cajolingly, going to
the dressing table and picking up the jewel case. "Take a squint at
this and tell me what you see."</p>

<p>Inspector Brenner followed Heath, without looking to right or
left, and, taking the jewel case, went silently to the window and
began to examine it. Vance, whose interest seemed suddenly to be
reawakened, came forward and stood watching him.</p>

<p>For fully five minutes the little expert inspected the case,
holding it within a few inches of his myopic eyes. Then he lifted
his glance to Heath and winked several times rapidly.</p>

<p>"Two instruments were used in opening this case." His voice was
small and high-pitched, but there was in it an undeniable quality
of authority. "One bent the lid and made several fractures on the
baked enamel. The other was, I should say, a steel chisel of some
kind, and was used to break the lock. The first instrument, which
was blunt, was employed amateurishly, at the wrong angle of
leverage; and the effort resulted only in twisting the overhang of
the lid. But the steel chisel was inserted with a knowledge of the
correct point of oscillation, where a minimum of leverage would
produce the counteracting stress necessary to displace the
lockbolts."</p>

<p>"A professional job?" suggested Heath.</p>

<p>"Highly so," answered the inspector, again blinking. "That is to
say, the forcing of the lock was professional. And I would even go
so far as to advance the opinion that the instrument used was one
especially constructed for such illegal purposes."</p>

<p>"Could this have done the job?" Heath held out the poker.</p>

<p>The other looked at it closely and turned it over several times.
"It might have been the instrument that bent the cover, but it was
not the one used for prying open the lock. This poker is cast iron
and would have snapped under any great pressure; whereas this box
is of cold rolled eighteen-gauge steel plate, with an inset
cylinder pin-tumbler lock taking a paracentric key. The leverage
force necessary to distort the flange sufficiently to lift the lid
could have been made only by a steel chisel."</p>

<p>"Well, that's that." Heath seemed well satisfied with Inspector
Brenner's conclusion. "I'll send the box down to you, Professor,
and you can let me know what else you find out."</p>

<p>"I'll take it along, if you have no objection." And the little
man tucked it under his arm and shuffled out without another
word.</p>

<p>Heath grinned at Markham. "Queer bird. He ain't happy unless
he's measuring jimmy marks on doors and windows and things. He
couldn't wait till I sent him the box. He'll hold it lovingly on
his lap all the way down in the subway, like a mother with a
baby."</p>

<p>Vance was still standing near the dressing table, gazing
perplexedly into space. "Markham," he said, "the condition of that
jewel case is positively astounding. It's unreasonable,
illogical&mdash;insane. It complicates the situation most damnably.
That steel box simply couldn't have been chiseled open by a
professional burglar...and yet, don't y' know, it actually
was."</p>

<p>Before Markham could reply, a satisfied grunt from Captain
Dubois attracted our attention. "I've got something for you,
Sergeant," he announced.</p>

<p>We moved expectantly into the living room. Dubois was bending
over the end of the library table almost directly behind the place
where Margaret Odell's body had been found. He took out an
insufflator, which was like a very small hand bellows, and blew a
fine light-yellow powder evenly over about a square foot of the
polished rosewood surface of the table top. Then he gently blew
away the surplus powder, and there appeared the impression of a
human hand distinctly registered in saffron. The bulb of the thumb
and each fleshy hummock between the joints of the fingers and
around the palm stood out like tiny circular islands. All the
papillary ridges were clearly discernible. The photographer then
hooked his camera to a peculiar adjustable tripod and, carefully
focusing his lens, took two flashlight pictures of the hand
mark.</p>

<p>"This ought to do." Dubois was pleased with his find. "It's the
right hand&mdash;a clear print&mdash;and the guy who made it was
standing right behind the dame...And it's the newest print in the
place."</p>

<p>"What about this box?" Heath pointed to the black document box
on the table near the overturned lamp.</p>

<p>"Not a mark&mdash;wiped clean."</p>

<p>Dubois began putting away his paraphernalia.</p>

<p>"I say, Captain Dubois," interposed Vance, "did you take a good
look at the inside doorknob of that clothes press?"</p>

<p>The man swung about abruptly and gave Vance a glowering look.
"People ain't in the habit of handling the inside knobs of closet
doors. They open and shut closets from the outside."</p>

<p>Vance raised his eyebrows in simulated astonishment.</p>

<p>"Do they, now, really?&mdash;Fancy that!...Still, don't y' know,
if one were inside the closet, one couldn't reach the outside
knob."</p>

<p>"The people <i>I</i> know don't shut themselves in clothes
closets." Dubois' tone was ponderously sarcastic.</p>

<p>"You positively amaze me!" declared Vance. "All the people I
know are addicted to the habit&mdash;a sort of daily pastime, don't
y' know."</p>

<p>Markham, always diplomatic, intervened. "What idea have you
about that closet, Vance?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I wish I had one," was the dolorous answer. "It's because
I can't, for the life of me, make sense of its neat and orderly
appearance that I'm so interested in it. Really, y' know, it should
have been artistically looted."</p>

<p>Heath was not entirely free from the same vague misgivings that
were disturbing Vance, for he turned to Dubois and said, "You might
go over the knob, Captain. As this gentleman says, there's
something funny about the condition of that closet."</p>

<p>Dubois, silent and surly, went to the closet door and sprayed
his yellow powder over the inside knob. When he had blown the loose
particles away, he bent over it with his magnifying glass. At
length he straightened up and gave Vance a look of ill-natured
appraisal.</p>

<p>"There's fresh prints on it, all right," he grudgingly admitted;
"and, unless I'm mistaken, they were made by the same hand as those
on the table. Both thumb marks are ulnar loops, and the index
fingers are both whorl patterns...Here, Pete," he ordered the
photographer, "make some shots of that knob."</p>

<p>When this had been done, Dubois, Bellamy, and the photographer
left us. A few minutes later, after an interchange of pleasantries,
Inspector Moran also departed. At the door he passed two men in the
white uniforms of interns, who had come to take away the girl's
body.</p>

<h2>5 - THE BOLTED DOOR</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 11; 10:30 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Markham and Heath and Vance and I were now alone in the
apartment. Dark, low-hanging clouds had drifted across the sun, and
the gray spectral light intensified the tragic atmosphere of the
rooms. Markham had lighted a cigar, and stood leaning against the
piano, looking about him with a disconsolate but determined air.
Vance had moved over to one of the pictures on the side wall of the
living room&mdash;Boucher's "La Berg&egrave;re Endormie" I think it
was&mdash;and stood looking at it with cynical contempt.</p>

<p>"Dimpled nudities, gamboling Cupids and woolly clouds for royal
cocottes," he commented. His distaste for all the painting of the
French decadence under Louis XV was profound. "One wonders what
pictures courtesans hung in their boudoirs before the invention of
these amorous eclogues, with their blue verdure and beribboned
sheep."</p>

<p>"I'm more interested at present in what took place in this
particular boudoir last night," retorted Markham impatiently.</p>

<p>"There's not much doubt about that, sir," said Heath
encouragingly. "And I've an idea that when Dubois checks up those
fingerprints with our files, we'll about know who did it."</p>

<p>Vance turned toward him with a rueful smile. "You're so
trusting, Sergeant. I, in turn, have an idea that, long before this
touchin' case is clarified, you'll wish the irascible captain with
the insect powder had never found those fingerprints." He made a
playful gesture of emphasis. "Permit me to whisper into your ear
that the person who left his sign manuals on yonder rosewood table
and cutglass doorknob had nothing whatever to do with the
precipitate demise of the fair Mademoiselle Odell."</p>

<p>"What is it you suspect?" demanded Markham sharply.</p>

<p>"Not a thing, old dear," blandly declared Vance. "I'm wandering
about in a mental murk as empty of signposts as interplanetary
space. The jaws of darkness do devour me up; I'm in the dead vast
and middle of the night. My mental darkness is Egyptian, Stygian,
Cimmerian&mdash;I'm in a perfect Erebus of tenebrosity."</p>

<p>Markham's jaw tightened in exasperation; he was familiar with
this evasive loquacity of Vance's. Dismissing the subject, he
addressed himself to Heath.</p>

<p>"Have you done any questioning of the people in the house
here?"</p>

<p>"I talked to Odell's maid and to the janitor and the switchboard
operators, but I didn't go much into details&mdash;I was waiting
for you. I'll say this, though: what they did tell me made my head
swim. If they don't back down on some of their statements, we're up
against it."</p>

<p>"Let's have them in now, then," suggested Markham; "the maid
first." He sat down on the piano bench with his back to the
keyboard.</p>

<p>Heath rose but, instead of going to the door, walked to the
oriel window. "There's one thing I want to call your attention to,
sir, before you interview these people, and that's the matter of
entrances and exits in this apartment."</p>

<p>He drew aside the gold-gauze curtain. "Look at that iron
grating. All the windows in this place, including the ones in the
bathroom, are equipped with iron bars just like these. It's only
eight or ten feet to the ground here, and whoever built this house
wasn't taking any chances of burglars getting in through the
windows."</p>

<p>He released the curtain and strode into the foyer. "Now, there's
only one entrance to this apartment, and that's this door here
opening off the main hall. There isn't a transom or an airshaft or
a dumbwaiter in the place, and that means that the only
way&mdash;<i>the only way</i>&mdash;that anybody can get in or out
of this apartment is through this door. Just keep that fact in your
mind, sir, while you're listening to the stories of these
people...Now, I'll have the maid brought in."</p>

<p>In response to Heath's order a detective led in a mulatto woman
about thirty years old. She was neatly dressed and gave one the
impression of capability. When she spoke, it was with a quiet,
clear enunciation which attested to a greater degree of education
than is ordinarily found in members of her class.</p>

<p>Her name, we learned, was Amy Gibson; and the information
elicited by Markham's preliminary questioning consisted of the
following facts:</p>

<p>She had arrived at the apartment that morning a few minutes
after seven, and, as was her custom, had let herself in with her
own key, as her mistress generally slept till late.</p>

<p>Once or twice a week she came early to do sewing and mending for
Miss Odell before the latter arose. On this particular morning she
had come early to make an alteration in a gown.</p>

<p>As soon as she had opened the door, she had been confronted by
the disorder of the apartment, for the Venetian-glass doors of the
foyer were wide open; and almost simultaneously she had noticed the
body of her mistress on the davenport.</p>

<p>She had called at once to Jessup, the night telephone operator
then on duty, who, after one glance into the living room, had
notified the police. She had then sat down in the public reception
room and waited for the arrival of the officers.</p>

<p>Her testimony had been simple and direct and intelligently
stated. If she was nervous or excited, she managed to keep her
feelings well under control.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Markham, after a short pause, "let us go back
to last night. At what time did you leave Miss Odell?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes before seven, sir," the woman answered, in a
colorless, even tone which seemed to be characteristic of her
speech.</p>

<p>"Is that your usual hour for leaving?"</p>

<p>"No; I generally go about six. But last night Miss Odell wanted
me to help her dress for dinner."</p>

<p>"Don't you always help her dress for dinner?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. But last night she was going with some gentleman to
dinner and the theater, and wanted to look specially nice."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Markham leaned forward. "And who was this gentleman?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir&mdash;Miss Odell didn't say."</p>

<p>"And you couldn't suggest who it might have been?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say, sir."</p>

<p>"And when did Miss Odell tell you that she wanted you to come
early this morning?"</p>

<p>"When I was leaving last night."</p>

<p>"So she evidently didn't anticipate any danger, or have any fear
of her companion."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look that way." The woman paused, as if considering.
"No, I know she didn't. She was in good spirits."</p>

<p>Markham turned to Heath.</p>

<p>"Any other questions you want to ask, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Heath removed an unlighted cigar from his mouth, and bent
forward, resting his hands on his knees.</p>

<p>"What jewelry did this Odell woman have on last night?" he
demanded gruffly.</p>

<p>The maid's manner became cool and a bit haughty.</p>

<p>"Miss Odell"&mdash;she emphasized the "Miss," by way of
reproaching him for the disrespect implied in his
omission&mdash;"wore all her rings, five or six of them, and three
bracelets&mdash;one of square diamonds, one of rubies, and one of
diamonds and emeralds. She also had on a sunburst of pear-shaped
diamonds on a chain round her neck, and she carried a platinum
lorgnette set with diamonds and pearls."</p>

<p>"Did she own any other jewelry?"</p>

<p>"A few small pieces, maybe, but I'm not sure."</p>

<p>"And did she keep 'em in the steel jewel case in the room?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when she wasn't wearing them." There was more than a
suggestion of sarcasm in the reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought maybe she kept 'em locked up when she had 'em
on." Heath's antagonism had been aroused by the maid's attitude; he
could not have failed to note that she had consistently omitted the
punctilious "sir" when answering him. He now stood up and pointed
loweringly to the black document box on the rosewood table.</p>

<p>"Ever see that before?"</p>

<p>The woman nodded indifferently. "Many times."</p>

<p>"Where was it generally kept?"</p>

<p>"In that thing." She indicated the Boule cabinet with a motion
of the head.</p>

<p>"What was in the box?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?"</p>

<p>"You don't know&mdash;huh?" Heath thrust out his jaw, but his
bullying attitude had no effect upon the impassive maid.</p>

<p>"I've got no idea," she replied calmly. "It was always kept
locked, and I never saw Miss Odell open it."</p>

<p>The sergeant walked over to the door of the living room
closet.</p>

<p>"See that key?" he asked angrily.</p>

<p>Again the woman nodded; but this time I detected a look of mild
astonishment in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Was that key always kept on the inside of the door?"</p>

<p>"No, it was always on the outside."</p>

<p>Heath shot Vance a curious look. Then, after a moment's frowning
contemplation of the knob, he waved his hand to the detective who
had brought the maid in.</p>

<p>"Take her back to the reception room, Snitkin, and get a
detailed description from her of all the Odell jewelry...And keep
her outside; I'll want her again."</p>

<p>When Snitkin and the maid had gone out, Vance lay back lazily on
the davenport, where he had sat during the interview, and sent a
spiral of cigarette smoke toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Rather illuminatin', what?" he remarked. "The dusky demoiselle
got us considerably forrader. Now we know that the closet key is on
the wrong side of the door, and that our <i>fille de joie</i> went
to the theater with one of her favorite <i>inamorati,</i> who
presumably brought her home shortly before she took her departure
from this wicked world."</p>

<p>"You think that's helpful, do you?" Heath's tone was
contemptuously triumphant. "Wait till you hear the crazy story the
telephone operator's got to tell."</p>

<p>"All right, Sergeant," put in Markham impatiently. "Suppose we
get on with the ordeal."</p>

<p>"I'm going to suggest, Mr. Markham, that we question the janitor
first. And I'll show you why." Heath went to the entrance door of
the apartment, and opened it. "Look here for just a minute,
sir."</p>

<p>He stepped out into the main hall and pointed down the little
passageway on the left. It was about ten feet in length and ran
between the Odell apartment and the blank rear wall of the
reception room. At the end of it was a solid oak door which gave on
the court at the side of the house.</p>

<p>"That door," explained Heath, "is the only side or rear entrance
to this building; and when that door is bolted, nobody can get into
the house except by the front entrance. You can't even get into the
building through the other apartments, for every window on this
floor is barred. I checked up on that point as soon as I got
here."</p>

<p>He led the way back into the living room.</p>

<p>"Now, after I'd looked over the situation this morning," he went
on, "I figured that our man had entered through that side door at
the end of the passageway, and had slipped into this apartment
without the night operator seeing him. So I tried the side door to
see if it was open. But it was bolted on the inside&mdash;not
locked, mind you, but bolted. And it wasn't a slip bolt, either,
that could have been jimmied or worked open from the outside, but a
tough old-fashioned turn bolt of solid brass...And now I want you
to hear what the janitor's got to say about it."</p>

<p>Markham nodded acquiescence, and Heath called an order to one of
the officers in the hall. A moment later a stolid, middle-aged
German, with sullen features and high cheekbones, stood before us.
His jaw was clamped tight, and he shifted his eyes from one to the
other of us suspiciously.</p>

<p>Heath straightway assumed the role of inquisitor. "What time do
you leave here at night?" He had, for some reason, assumed a
belligerent manner.</p>

<p>"Six o'clock&mdash;sometimes earlier, sometimes later." The man
spoke in a surly monotone. He was obviously resentful at this
unexpected intrusion upon his orderly routine.</p>

<p>"And what time do you get here in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock, regular."</p>

<p>"What time did you go home last night?"</p>

<p>"About six&mdash;maybe quarter past."</p>

<p>Heath paused and finally lighted the cigar on which he had been
chewing at intervals during the past hour.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me about that side door," he went on, with
undiminished aggressiveness. "You told me you lock it every night
before you leave&mdash;is that right?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ja</i>&mdash;that's right." The man nodded his head
affirmatively several times. "Only I don't lock it&mdash;I bolt
it."</p>

<p>"All right, you bolt it, then." As Heath talked his cigar bobbed
up and down between his lips; smoke and words came simultaneously
from his mouth. "And last night you bolted it as usual about six
o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Maybe a quarter past," the janitor amended, with Germanic
precision.</p>

<p>"You're sure you bolted it last night?" The question was almost
ferocious.</p>

<p><i>"Ja, ja.</i> Sure, I am. I do it every night. I never
miss."</p>

<p>The man's earnestness left no doubt that the door in question
had indeed been bolted on the inside at about six o'clock of the
previous evening. Heath, however, belabored the point for several
minutes, only to be reassured doggedly that the door had been
bolted. At last the janitor was dismissed.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, Sergeant," remarked Vance with an amused
smile, "that honest Rheinlander bolted the door."</p>

<p>"Sure, he did," spluttered Heath, "and I found it still bolted
this morning at quarter of eight. That's just what messes things up
so nice and pretty. If that door was bolted from six o'clock last
evening until eight o'clock this morning, I'd appreciate having
someone drive up in a hearse and tell me how the Canary's little
playmate got in here last night. And I'd also like to know how he
got out."</p>

<p>"Why not through the main entrance?" asked Markham. "It seems
the only logical way left, according to your own findings."</p>

<p>"That's how I had it figured out, sir," returned Heath. "But
wait till you hear what the phone operator has to say."</p>

<p>"And the phone operator's post," mused Vance, "is in the main
hall halfway between the front door and this apartment. Therefore,
the gentleman who caused all the disturbance hereabouts last night
would have had to pass within a few feet of the operator both on
arriving and departing&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"That's it!" snapped Heath. "And, according to the operator, no
such person came or went."</p>

<p>Markham seemed to have absorbed some of Heath's irritability.
"Get the fellow in here, and let me question him," he ordered.</p>

<p>Heath obeyed with a kind of malicious alacrity.</p>

<h2>6 - A CALL FOR HELP</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 11; 11 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Jessup made a good impression from the moment he entered the
room. He was a serious, determined-looking man in his early
thirties, rugged and well built; and there was a squareness to his
shoulders that carried a suggestion of military training. He walked
with a decided limp&mdash;his right foot dragged
perceptibly&mdash;and I noted that his left arm had been stiffened
into a permanent arc, as if by an unreduced fracture of the elbow.
He was quiet and reserved, and his eyes were steady and
intelligent. Markham at once motioned him to a wicker chair beside
the closet door, but he declined it, and stood before the district
attorney in a soldierly attitude of respectful attention. Markham
opened the interrogation with several personal questions. It
transpired that Jessup had been a sergeant in the World War,* had
twice been seriously wounded, and had been invalided home shortly
before the armistice. He had held his present post of telephone
operator for over a year.</p>

<p>* His full name was William Elmer Jessup, and he had been
attached to the 308th Infantry of the 77th Division of the Overseas
Forces.</p>

<p>"Now, Jessup," continued Markham, "there are things connected
with last night's tragedy that you can tell us."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." There was no doubt that this ex-soldier would tell
us accurately anything he knew, and also that, if he had any doubt
as to the correctness of his information, he would frankly say so.
He possessed all the qualities of a careful and well-trained
witness.</p>

<p>"First of all, what time did you come on duty last night?"</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock, sir." There was no qualification to this blunt
statement; one felt that Jessup would arrive punctually at whatever
hour he was due. "It was my short shift. The day man and myself
alternate in long and short shifts."</p>

<p>"And did you see Miss Odell come in last night after the
theater?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Everyone who comes in has to pass the
switchboard."</p>

<p>"What time did she arrive?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been more than a few minutes after
eleven."</p>

<p>"Was she alone?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. There was a gentleman with her."</p>

<p>"Do you know who he was?"</p>

<p>"I don't know his name, sir. But I have seen him several times
before when he has called on Miss Odell."</p>

<p>"You could describe him, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He's tall and clean-shaven except for a very short
gray moustache, and is about forty-five, I should say. He
looks&mdash;if you understand me, sir&mdash;like a man of wealth
and position."</p>

<p>Markham nodded. "And now, tell me: did he accompany Miss Odell
into her apartment or did he go immediately away?"</p>

<p>"He went in with Miss Odell and stayed about half an hour."</p>

<p>Markham's eyes brightened, and there was a suppressed eagerness
in his next words. "Then he arrived about eleven, and was alone
with Miss Odell in her apartment until about half past eleven.
You're sure of these facts?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's correct," the man affirmed.</p>

<p>Markham paused and leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Now, Jessup, think carefully before answering: did any one else
call on Miss Odell at any time last night?"</p>

<p>"No one, sir," was the unhesitating reply.</p>

<p>"How can you be so sure?"</p>

<p>"I would have seen them, sir. They would have had to pass the
switchboard in order to reach this apartment."</p>

<p>"And don't you ever leave the switchboard?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>"No, sir," the man assured him vigorously, as if protesting
against the implication that he would desert a post of duty. "When
I want a drink of water, or go to the toilet, I use the little
lavatory in the reception room; but I always hold the door open and
keep my eye on the switchboard in case the pilot light should show
up for a telephone call. Nobody could walk down the hall, even if I
was in the lavatory, without my seeing them."</p>

<p>One could well believe that the conscientious Jessup kept his
eye at all times on the switchboard lest a call should flash and go
unanswered. The man's earnestness and reliability were obvious; and
there was no doubt in any of our minds, I think, that if Miss Odell
had had another visitor that night, Jessup would have known of
it.</p>

<p>But Heath, with the thoroughness of his nature, rose quickly and
stepped out into the main hall. In a moment he returned, looking
troubled but satisfied.</p>

<p>"Right!" He nodded to Markham. "The lavatory door's on a direct
unobstructed line with the switchboard."</p>

<p>Jessup took no notice of this verification of his statement, and
stood, his eyes attentively on the district attorney, awaiting any
further questions that might be asked him. There was something both
admirable and confidence-inspiring in his unruffled demeanor.</p>

<p>"What about last night?" resumed Markham. "Did you leave the
switchboard often, or for long?"</p>

<p>"Just once, sir; and then only to go to the lavatory for a
minute or two. But I watched the board the whole time."</p>

<p>"And you'd be willing to state on oath that no one else called
on Miss Odell from ten o'clock on, and that no one, except her
escort, left her apartment after that hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I would."</p>

<p>He was plainly telling the truth, and Markham pondered several
moments before proceeding.</p>

<p>"What about the side door?"</p>

<p>"That's kept locked all night, sir. The janitor bolts it when he
leaves and unbolts it in the morning. I never touch it."</p>

<p>Markham leaned back and turned to Heath.</p>

<p>"The testimony of the janitor and Jessup here," he said, "seems
to limit the situation pretty narrowly to Miss Odell's escort. If,
as seems reasonable to assume, the side door was bolted all night,
and if no other caller came or went through the front door, it
looks as if the man we wanted to find was the one who brought her
home."</p>

<p>Heath gave a short, mirthless laugh. "That would be fine, sir,
if something else hadn't happened around here last night." Then to
Jessup: "Tell the district attorney the rest of the story about
this man."</p>

<p>Markham looked toward the operator with expectant interest; and
Vance, lifting himself on one elbow, listened attentively.</p>

<p>Jessup spoke in a level voice, with the alert and careful manner
of a soldier reporting to his superior officer.</p>

<p>"It was just this, sir. When the gentleman came out of Miss
Odell's apartment at about half past eleven, he stopped at the
switchboard and asked me to get him a Yellow Taxicab. I put the
call through, and while he was waiting for the car, Miss Odell
screamed and called for help. The gentleman turned and rushed to
the apartment door, and I followed quickly behind him. He knocked;
but at first there was no answer. Then he knocked again, and at the
same time called out to Miss Odell and asked her what was the
matter. This time she answered. She said everything was all right,
and told him to go home and not to worry. Then he walked back with
me to the switchboard, remarking that he guessed Miss Odell must
have fallen asleep and had a nightmare. We talked for a few minutes
about the war, and then the taxicab came. He said good night and
went out, and I heard the car drive away."</p>

<p>It was plain to see that this epilogue of the departure of Miss
Odell's anonymous escort completely upset Markham's theory of the
case. He looked down at the floor with a baffled expression and
smoked vigorously for several moments. At last he said:</p>

<p>"How long was it after this man came out of the apartment that
you heard Miss Odell scream?"</p>

<p>"About five minutes. I had put my connection through to the
taxicab company, and it was a minute or so later that she
screamed."</p>

<p>"Was the man near the switchboard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. In fact, he had one arm resting on it."</p>

<p>"How many times did Miss Odell scream? And just what did she say
when she called for help?"</p>

<p>"She screamed twice and then cried, 'Help! Help!'"</p>

<p>"And when the man knocked on the door the second time, what did
he say?"</p>

<p>"As near as I can recollect, sir, he said, 'Open the door,
Margaret! What's the trouble?'"</p>

<p>"And can you remember her exact words when she answered
him?"</p>

<p>Jessup hesitated and frowned reflectively. "As I recall, she
said, 'There's nothing the matter. I'm sorry I screamed.
Everything's all right, so please go home, and don't worry.'...Of
course, that may not be exactly what she said, but it was something
very close to it."</p>

<p>"You could hear her plainly through the door, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. These doors are not very thick."</p>

<p>Markham rose and began pacing meditatively. At length, halting
in front of the operator, he asked another question:</p>

<p>"Did you hear any other suspicious sounds in this apartment
after the man left?"</p>

<p>"Not a sound of any kind, sir," Jessup declared. "Someone from
outside the building, however, telephoned Miss Odell about ten
minutes later, and a man's voice answered from her apartment."</p>

<p>"What's this!" Markham spun round, and Heath sat up at
attention, his eyes wide. "Tell me every detail of that call."</p>

<p>Jessup complied unemotionally.</p>

<p>"About twenty minutes to twelve a trunk light flashed on the
board, and when I answered it, a man asked for Miss Odell. I
plugged the connection through, and after a short wait the receiver
was lifted from her phone&mdash;you can tell when a receiver's
taken off the hook, because the guide light on the board goes
out&mdash;and a man's voice answered 'Hello.' I pulled the
listening-in key over, and, of course, didn't hear any more."</p>

<p>There was silence in the apartment for several minutes. Then
Vance, who had been watching Jessup closely during the interview,
spoke.</p>

<p>"By the bye, Mr. Jessup," he asked carelessly, "were you
yourself, by any chance, a bit fascinated&mdash;let us say&mdash;by
the charming Miss Odell?"</p>

<p>For the first time since entering the room the man appeared ill
at ease. A dull flush overspread his cheeks. "I thought she was a
very beautiful lady," he answered resolutely.</p>

<p>Markham gave Vance a look of disapproval, and then addressed
himself abruptly to the operator. "That will be all for the moment,
Jessup."</p>

<p>The man bowed stiffly and limped out.</p>

<p>"This case is becoming positively fascinatin'," murmured Vance,
relaxing once more upon the davenport.</p>

<p>"It's comforting to know that someone's enjoying it." Markham's
tone was irritable. "And what, may I ask, was the object of your
question concerning Jessup's sentiments toward the dead woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a vagrant notion struggling in my brain," returned
Vance. "And then, y' know, a bit of <i>boudoir racontage</i> always
enlivens a situation, what?"</p>

<p>Heath, rousing himself from gloomy abstraction, spoke up.</p>

<p>"We've still got the fingerprints, Mr. Markham. And I'm thinking
that they're going to locate our man for us."</p>

<p>"But even if Dubois does identify those prints," said Markham,
"we'll have to show how the owner of them got into this place last
night. He'll claim, of course, they were made prior to the
crime."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a sure thing," declared Heath stubbornly, "that
there was some man in here last night when Odell got back from the
theater, and that he was still here until after the other man left
at half past eleven. The woman's screams and the answering of that
phone call at twenty minutes to twelve prove it. And since Doc
Doremus said that the murder took place before midnight, there's no
getting away from the fact that the guy who was hiding in here did
the job."</p>

<p>"That appears incontrovertible," agreed Markham. "And I'm
inclined to think it was someone she knew. She probably screamed
when he first revealed himself, and then, recognizing him, calmed
down and told the other man out in the hall that nothing was the
matter...Later on he strangled her."</p>

<p>"And, I might suggest," added Vance, "that his place of hiding
was that clothes press."</p>

<p>"Sure," the sergeant concurred. "But what's bothering me is how
he got in here. The day operator who was at the switchboard until
ten last night told me that the man who called and took Odell out
to dinner was the only visitor she had."</p>

<p>Markham gave a grunt of exasperation.</p>

<p>"Bring the day man in here," he ordered. "We've got to
straighten this thing out. <i>Somebody</i> got in here last night,
and before I leave, I'm going to find out how it was done."</p>

<p>Vance gave him a look of patronizing amusement.</p>

<p>"Y' know, Markham," he said, "I'm not blessed with the gift of
psychic inspiration, but I have one of those strange, indescribable
feelings, as the minor poets say, that if you really contemplate
remaining in this bestrewn boudoir till you've discovered how the
mysterious visitor gained admittance here last night, you'd do
jolly well to send for your toilet access'ries and several changes
of fresh linen&mdash;not to mention your pyjamas. The chap who
engineered this little soiree planned his entrance and exit most
carefully and perspicaciously."</p>

<p>Markham regarded Vance dubiously but made no reply.</p>

<h2>7 - A NAMELESS VISITOR</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 11; 11:15 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Heath had stepped out into the hall, and now returned with the
day telephone operator, a sallow, thin young man who, we learned,
was named Spively. His almost black hair, which accentuated the
pallor of his face, was sleeked back from his forehead with pomade;
and he wore a very shallow moustache which barely extended beyond
the alae of his nostrils. He was dressed in an exaggeratedly dapper
fashion, in a dazzling chocolate-colored suit cut very close to his
figure, a pair of cloth-topped buttoned shoes, and a pink shirt
with a stiff turn-over collar to match. He appeared nervous, and
immediately sat down in the wicker chair by the door, fingering the
sharp creases of his trousers, and running the tip of his tongue
over his lips.</p>

<p>Markham went straight to the point.</p>

<p>"I understand you were at the switchboard yesterday afternoon
and last night until ten o'clock. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>Spively swallowed hard and nodded his head. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What time did Miss Odell go out to dinner?"</p>

<p>"About seven o'clock. I'd just sent to the restaurant next door
for some sandwiches&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did she go alone?" Markham interrupted his explanation.</p>

<p>"No. A fella called for her."</p>

<p>"Did you know this 'fella'?"</p>

<p>"I'd seen him a couple of times calling on Miss Odell, but I
didn't know who he was."</p>

<p>"What did he look like?" Markham's question was uttered with
hurried impatience.</p>

<p>Spively's description of the girl's escort tallied with Jessup's
description of the man who had accompanied her home, though Spively
was more voluble and less precise than Jessup had been. Patently,
Miss Odell had gone out at seven and returned at eleven with the
same man.</p>

<p>"Now," resumed Markham, putting an added stress on his words, "I
want to know who else called on Miss Odell between the time she
went out to dinner and ten o'clock when you left the
switchboard."</p>

<p>Spively was puzzled by the question, and his thin arched
eyebrows lifted and contracted. "I&mdash;don't understand," he
stammered. "How could any one call on Miss Odell when she was
out?"</p>

<p>"Someone evidently did," said Markham. "And he got into her
apartment and was there when she returned at eleven."</p>

<p>The youth's eyes opened wide, and his lips fell apart. "My God,
sir!" he exclaimed. "So that's how they murdered her!&mdash;laid in
wait for her!..." He stopped abruptly, suddenly realizing his own
proximity to the mysterious chain of events that had led up to the
crime. "But nobody got into her apartment while I was on duty," he
blurted, with frightened emphasis. "Nobody! I never left the board
from the time she went out until quitting time."</p>

<p>"Couldn't anyone have come in the side door?"</p>

<p>"What! Was it unlocked?" Spively's tone was startled. "It never
is unlocked at night. The janitor bolts it when he leaves at
six."</p>

<p>"And you didn't unbolt it last night for any purpose?
Think!"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't!" He shook his head earnestly.</p>

<p>"And you are positive that no one got into the apartment through
the front door after Miss Odell left?"</p>

<p>"Positive! I tell you I didn't leave the board the whole time,
and nobody could've got by me without my knowing it. There was only
one person that called and asked for her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! So someone did call!" snapped Markham. "When was it? And
what happened?&mdash;Jog your memory before you answer."</p>

<p>"It wasn't anything important," the youth assured him, genuinely
frightened. "Just a fella who came in and rang her bell and went
right out again."</p>

<p>"Never mind whether it was important or not." Markham's tone was
cold and peremptory. "What time did he call?"</p>

<p>"About half past nine."</p>

<p>"And who was he?"</p>

<p>"A young fella I've seen come here several times to see Miss
Odell. I don't know his name."</p>

<p>"Tell me exactly what took place," pursued Markham.</p>

<p>Again Spively swallowed hard and wetted his lips.</p>

<p>"It was like this," he began, with effort. "The fella came in
and started walking down the hall and I said to him, 'Miss Odell
isn't in.' But he kept on going and said, 'Oh, well, I'll ring the
bell anyway to make sure.' A telephone call came through just then,
and I let him go on. He rang the bell and knocked on the door, but
of course there wasn't any answer; and pretty soon he came on back
and said, 'I guess you were right.' Then he tossed me half a dollar
and went out."</p>

<p>"You actually saw him go out?" There was a note of
disappointment in Markham's voice.</p>

<p>"Sure, I saw him go out. He stopped just inside the front door
and lit a cigarette. Then he opened the door and turned toward
Broadway."</p>

<p>"'One by one the rosy petals fall,'" came Vance's indolent
voice. "A most amusin' situation!"</p>

<p>Markham was loath to relinquish his hope in the criminal
possibilities of this one caller who had come and gone at half past
nine.</p>

<p>"What was this man like?" he asked. "Can you describe him?"</p>

<p>Spively sat up straight, and when he answered, it was with an
enthusiasm that showed he had taken special note of the
visitor.</p>

<p>"He was good-looking, not so old&mdash;maybe thirty. And he had
on a full-dress suit and patent-leather pumps, and a pleated silk
shirt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, what?" demanded Vance, in simulated unbelief, leaning
over the back of the davenport. "A silk shirt with evening dress!
Most extr'ordin'ry!"</p>

<p>"Oh, a lot of the best dressers are wearing them," Spively
explained, with condescending pride. "It's all the fashion for
dancing."</p>

<p>"You don't say&mdash;really!" Vance appeared dumbfounded. "I
must look into this...And, by the bye, when this Beau Brummel of
the silk shirt paused by the front door, did he take his cigarette
from a long flat silver case carried in his lower waistcoat
pocket?"</p>

<p>The youth looked at Vance in admiring astonishment.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Simple deduction," Vance explained, resuming his recumbent
posture. "Large metal cigarette cases carried in the waistcoat
pocket somehow go with silk shirts for evening wear."</p>

<p>Markham, clearly annoyed at the interruption, cut in sharply
with a demand for the operator to proceed with his description.</p>

<p>"He wore his hair smoothed down," Spively continued, "and you
could see it was kind of long; but it was cut in the latest style.
And he had a small waxed moustache; and there was a big carnation
in the lapel of his coat, and he had on chamois gloves..."</p>

<p>"My word!" murmured Vance. "A gigolo!"</p>

<p>Markham, with the incubus of the nightclubs riding him heavily,
frowned and took a deep breath. Vance's observation evidently had
launched him on an unpleasant train of thought.</p>

<p>"Was this man short or tall?" he asked next.</p>

<p>"He wasn't so tall&mdash;about my height," Spively explained.
"And he was sort of thin."</p>

<p>There was an easily recognizable undercurrent of admiration in
his tone, and I felt that this youthful telephone operator had seen
in Miss Odell's caller a certain physical and sartorial ideal. This
palpable admiration, coupled with the somewhat <i>outr&eacute;</i>
clothes affected by the youth, permitted us to read between the
lines of his remarks a fairly accurate description of the man who
had unsuccessfully rung the dead girl's bell at half past nine the
night before.</p>

<p>When Spively had been dismissed, Markham rose and strode about
the room, his head enveloped in a cloud of cigar smoke, while Heath
sat stolidly watching him, his brows knit.</p>

<p>Vance stood up and stretched himself.</p>

<p>"The absorbin' problem, it would seem, remains <i>in statu
quo,"</i> he remarked airily. "How, oh, how, did the fair
Margaret's executioner get in?"</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Markham," rumbled Heath sententiously, "I've been
thinking that the fellow may have come here earlier in the
afternoon&mdash;say, before that side door was locked. Odell
herself may have let him in and hidden him when the other man came
to take her to dinner."</p>

<p>"It looks that way," Markham admitted. "Bring the maid in here
again, and we'll see what we can find out."</p>

<p>When the woman had been brought in, Markham questioned her as to
her actions during the afternoon, and learned that she had gone out
at about four to do some shopping and had returned about half past
five.</p>

<p>"Did Miss Odell have any visitor with her when you got
back?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," was the prompt answer. "She was alone."</p>

<p>"Did she mention that anyone had called?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Now," continued Markham, "could anyone have been hidden in this
apartment when you went home at seven?"</p>

<p>The maid was frankly astonished and even a little horrified.
"Where could anyone hide?" she asked, looking round the
apartment.</p>

<p>"There are several possible places," Markham suggested: "in the
bathroom, in one of the clothes closets, under the bed, behind the
window draperies..."</p>

<p>The woman shook her head decisively. "No one could have been
hidden," she declared. "I was in the bathroom half a dozen times,
and I got Miss Odell's gown out of the clothes closet in the
bedroom. As soon as it began to get dark, I drew all the window
shades myself. And as for the bed, it's built almost down to the
floor; no one could squeeze under it." (I glanced closely at the
bed and realized that this statement was quite true.)</p>

<p>"What about the clothes closet in this room?" Markham put the
question hopefully, but again the maid shook her head.</p>

<p>"Nobody was in there. That's where I keep my own hat and coat,
and I took them out myself when I was getting ready to go. I even
put away one of Miss Odell's old dresses in that closet before I
left."</p>

<p>"And you are absolutely certain," reiterated Markham, "that no
one could have been hidden anywhere in these rooms at the time you
went home?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to remember if the key of this clothes closet was
on the inside or the outside of the lock when you opened the door
to get your hat?"</p>

<p>The woman paused and looked thoughtfully at the closet door. "It
was on the outside, where it always was," she announced, after
several moments' reflection. "I remember because it caught in the
chiffon of the old dress I put away."</p>

<p>Markham frowned and then resumed his questioning. "You say you
don't know the name of Miss Odell's dinner companion last night.
Can you tell us the names of any men she was in the habit of going
out with?"</p>

<p>"Miss Odell never mentioned any names to me," the woman said.
"She was very careful about it, too&mdash;secretive, you might say.
You see, I'm only here in the daytime, and the gentlemen she knew
generally came in the evening."</p>

<p>"And you never heard her speak of anyone of whom she was
frightened&mdash;anyone she had reason to fear?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;although there was one man she was trying to get
rid of. He was a bad character&mdash;I wouldn't have trusted him
anywhere&mdash;and I told Miss Odell she'd better look out for him.
But she'd known him a long time, I guess, and had been pretty soft
on him once."</p>

<p>"How do you happen to know this?"</p>

<p>"One day, about a week ago," the maid explained, "I came in
after lunch, and he was with her in the other room. They didn't
hear me, because the portieres were drawn. He was demanding money,
and when she tried to put him off, he began threatening her. And
she said something that showed she'd given him money before. I made
a noise, and then they stopped arguing; and pretty soon he went
out."</p>

<p>"What did this man look like?" Markham's interest was
reviving.</p>

<p>"He was kind of thin&mdash;not very tall&mdash;and I'd say he
was around thirty. He had a hard face&mdash;good-looking, some
would say&mdash;and pale blue eyes that gave you the shivers. He
always wore his hair greased back, and he had a little yellow
moustache pointed at the ends."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Vance. "Our gigolo!"</p>

<p>"Has this man been here since?" asked Markham.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir&mdash;not when I was here."</p>

<p>"That will be all," said Markham; and the woman went out.</p>

<p>"She didn't help us much," complained Heath.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Vance. "I think she did remarkably well. She
cleared up several moot points."</p>

<p>"And just what portions of her information do you consider
particularly illuminating?" asked Markham, with ill-concealed
annoyance.</p>

<p>"We now know, do we not," rejoined Vance serenely, "that no one
was lying <i>perdu</i> in here when the <i>bonne</i> departed
yesterevening."</p>

<p>"Instead of that fact being helpful," retorted Markham, "I'd say
it added materially to the complications of the situation."</p>

<p>"It would appear that way, wouldn't it, now? But, then&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;it may prove to be your brightest and most comfortin'
clue...Furthermore, we learned that someone evidently locked
himself in that clothes press, as witness the shifting of the key,
and that, moreover, this occulation did not occur until the abigail
had gone, or, let us say, after seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Heath with sour facetiousness; "when the side door
was bolted and an operator was sitting in the front hall, who
swears nobody came in that way."</p>

<p>"It is a bit mystifyin'," Vance conceded sadly.</p>

<p>"Mystifying? It's impossible!" grumbled Markham.</p>

<p>Heath, who was now staring with meditative pugnacity into the
closet, shook his head helplessly.</p>

<p>"What I don't understand," he ruminated, "is why, if the fellow
was hiding in the closet, he didn't ransack it when he came out,
like he did all the rest of the apartment."</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Vance, "you've put your finger on the crux of
the matter...Y' know, the neat, undisturbed aspect of that closet
rather suggests that the crude person who rifled these charming
rooms omitted to give it his attention because it was locked on the
inside and he couldn't open it."</p>

<p>"Come, come!" protested Markham. "That theory implies that there
were two unknown persons in here last night."</p>

<p>Vance sighed. "Harrow and alas! I know it. And we can't
introduce even one into this apartment logically...Distressin',
ain't it?"</p>

<p>Heath sought consolation in a new line of thought.</p>

<p>"Anyway," he submitted, "we know that the fancy fellow with the
patent-leather pumps who called here last night at half past nine
was probably Odell's lover, and was grafting on her."</p>

<p>"And in just what recondite way does that obvious fact help to
roll the clouds away?" asked Vance. "Nearly every modern Delilah
has an avaricious <i>amoroso.</i> It would be rather singular if
there wasn't such a chap in the offing, what?"</p>

<p>"That's all right, too," returned Heath. "But I'll tell you
something, Mr. Vance, that maybe you don't know. The men that these
girls lose their heads over are generally crooks of some
kind&mdash;professional criminals, you understand. That's why,
knowing that this job was the work of a professional, it don't
leave me cold, as you might say, to learn that this fellow who was
threatening Odell and grafting on her was the same one who was
prowling round here last night...And I'll say this, too: the
description of him sounds a whole lot like the kind of high-class
burglars that hang out at these swell all-night cafes."</p>

<p>"You're convinced, then," asked Vance mildly, "that this job, as
you call it, was done by a professional criminal?"</p>

<p>Heath was almost contemptuous in his reply. "Didn't the guy wear
gloves and use a jimmy? It was a yeggman's job, all right."</p>

<h2>8 - THE INVISIBLE MURDERER</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 11; 11:45 A.M.</i>
</p>

<p>Markham went to the window and stood, his hands behind him,
looking down into the little paved rear yard. After several minutes
he turned slowly.</p>

<p>"The situation, as I see it," he said, "boils down to
this:&mdash;The Odell girl has an engagement for dinner and the
theater with a man of some distinction. He calls for her a little
after seven, and they go out together. At eleven o'clock they
return. He goes with her into her apartment and remains half an
hour. He leaves at half past eleven and asks the phone operator to
call him a taxi. While he is waiting the girl screams and calls for
help, and, in response to his inquiries, she tells him nothing is
wrong and bids him go away. The taxi arrives, and he departs in it.
Ten minutes later someone telephones her, and a man answers from
her apartment. This morning she is found murdered, and the
apartment ransacked."</p>

<p>He took a long draw on his cigar.</p>

<p>"Now, it is obvious that when she and her escort returned last
night, there was another man in this place somewhere; and it is
also obvious that the girl was alive after her escort had departed.
Therefore, we must conclude that the man who was already in the
apartment was the person who murdered her. This conclusion is
further corroborated by Doctor Doremus's report that the crime
occurred between eleven and twelve. But since her escort did not
leave till half past eleven, and spoke with her after that time, we
can put the actual hour of the murder as between half past eleven
and midnight...These are the inferable facts from the evidence thus
far adduced."</p>

<p>"There's not much getting away from 'em," agreed Heath.</p>

<p>"At any rate, they're interestin'," murmured Vance.</p>

<p>Markham, walking up and down earnestly, continued: "The features
of the situation revolving round these inferable facts are as
follows:&mdash;There was no one hiding in the apartment at seven
o'clock&mdash;the hour the maid went home. Therefore, the murderer
entered the apartment later. First, then, let us consider the side
door. At six o'clock, an hour before the maid's departure, the
janitor bolted it on the inside, and both operators disavow
emphatically that they went near it. Moreover, you, Sergeant, found
it bolted this morning. Hence, we may assume that the door was
bolted on the inside all night, and that nobody could have entered
that way. Consequently, we are driven to the inevitable alternative
that the murderer entered by the front door. Now, let us consider
this other means of entry. The phone operator who was on duty until
ten o'clock last night asserts positively that the only person who
entered the front door and passed down the main hall to this
apartment was a man who rang the bell and, getting no answer,
immediately walked out again. The other operator, who was on duty
from ten o'clock until this morning, asserts with equal
positiveness that no one entered the front door and passed the
switchboard coming to this apartment. Add to all this the fact that
every window on this floor is barred, and that no one from upstairs
can descend into the main hall without coming face to face with the
operator, and we are, for the moment, confronted with an
impasse."</p>

<p>Heath scratched his head and laughed mirthlessly. "It don't make
sense, does it, sir?"</p>

<p>"What about the next apartment?" asked Vance, "the one with the
door facing the rear passageway&mdash;No. 2, I think?"</p>

<p>Heath turned to him patronizingly. "I looked into that the first
thing this morning. Apartment No. 2 is occupied by a single woman;
and I woke her up at eight o'clock and searched the place. Nothing
there. Anyway, you have to walk past the switchboard to reach her
apartment the same as you do to reach this one; and nobody called
on her or left her apartment last night. What's more, Jessup, who's
a shrewd sound lad, told me this woman is a quiet, ladylike sort,
and that she and Odell didn't even know each other."</p>

<p>"You're so thorough, Sergeant!" murmured Vance.</p>

<p>"Of course," put in Markham, "it would have been possible for
someone from the other apartment to have slipped in here behind the
operator's back between seven and eleven, and then to have slipped
back after the murder. But as Sergeant Heath's search this morning
failed to uncover anyone, we can eliminate the possibility of our
man having operated from that quarter."</p>

<p>"I dare say you're right," Vance indifferently admitted. "But it
strikes me, Markham old dear, that your own affectin'
recapitulation of the situation jolly well eliminates the
possibility of your man's having operated from any quarter...And
yet he came in, garroted the unfortunate damsel, and
departed&mdash;eh, what?...It's a charmin' little problem. I
wouldn't have missed it for worlds."</p>

<p>"It's uncanny," pronounced Markham gloomily.</p>

<p>"It's positively spiritualistic," amended Vance. "It has the
caressin' odor of a s&eacute;ance. Really, y' know, I'm beginning
to suspect that some medium was hovering in the vicinage last night
doing some rather tip-top materializations...I say, Markham, could
you get an indictment against an ectoplasmic emanation?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't no spook that made those fingerprints," growled
Heath, with surly truculence.</p>

<p>Markham halted his nervous pacing and regarded Vance irritably.
"Damn it! This is rank nonsense. The man got in some way, and he
got out, too. There's something wrong somewhere. Either the maid is
mistaken about someone being here when she left, or else one of
those phone operators went to sleep and won't admit it."</p>

<p>"Or else one of 'em's lying," supplemented Heath.</p>

<p>Vance shook his head. "The dusky <i>fille de chambre,</i> I'd
say, is eminently trustworthy. And if there was any doubt about
anyone's having come in the front door unnoticed, the lads on the
switchboard would, in the present circumstances, be only too eager
to admit it...No, Markham, you'll simply have to approach this
affair from the astral plane, so to speak."</p>

<p>Markham grunted his distaste of Vance's jocularity. "That line
of investigation I leave to you with your metaphysical theories and
esoteric hypotheses."</p>

<p>"But, consider," protested Vance banteringly. "You've proved
conclusively&mdash;or, rather, you've demonstrated
legally&mdash;that no one could have entered or departed from this
apartment last night; and, as you've often told me, a court of law
must decide all matters, not in accord with the known or suspected
facts, but according to the evidence; and the evidence in this case
would prove a sound alibi for every corporeal being extant. And
yet, it's not exactly tenable, d' ye see, that the lady strangled
herself. If only it had been poison, what an exquisite and
satisfyin' suicide case you'd have!...Most inconsiderate of her
homicidal visitor not to have used arsenic instead of his
hands!"</p>

<p>"Well, he strangled her," pronounced Heath. "Furthermore, I'll
lay my money on the fellow who called here last night at half past
nine and couldn't get in. He's the bird I want to talk to."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Vance produced another cigarette. "I shouldn't say, to
judge from our description of him, that his conversation would
prove particularly fascinatin'."</p>

<p>An ugly light came into Heath's eyes. "We've got ways," he said
through his teeth, "of getting damn interesting conversation outta
people who haven't no great reputation for repartee."</p>

<p>Vance sighed. "How the Four Hundred needs you, my Sergeant!"</p>

<p>Markham looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I've got pressing work at the office," he said, "and all this
talk isn't getting us anywhere." He put his hand on Heath's
shoulder. "I leave you to go ahead. This afternoon I'll have these
people brought down to my office for another
questioning&mdash;maybe I can jog their memories a bit...You've got
some line of investigation planned?"</p>

<p>"The usual routine," replied Heath drearily. "I'll go through
Odell's papers, and I'll have three or four of my men check up on
her."</p>

<p>"You'd better get after the Yellow Taxicab Company right away,"
Markham suggested. "Find out, if you can, who the man was who left
here at half past eleven last night, and where he went."</p>

<p>"Do you imagine for one moment," asked Vance, "that if this man
knew anything about the murder, he would have stopped in the hall
and asked the operator to call a taxi for him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't look for much in that direction." Markham's tone
was almost listless. "But the girl may have said something to him
that'll give us a lead."</p>

<p>Vance shook his head facetiously. "O welcome pure-ey'd Faith,
white-handed Hope, thou hovering angel, girt with golden
wings!"</p>

<p>Markham was in no mood for chaffing. He turned to Heath, and
spoke with forced cheeriness. "Call me up later this afternoon. I
may get some new evidence out of the outfit we've just
interviewed...And," he added, "be sure to put a man on guard here.
I want this apartment kept just as it is until we see a little more
light."</p>

<p>"I'll attend to that," Heath assured him.</p>

<p>Markham and Vance and I went out and entered the car. A few
minutes later we were winding rapidly across town through Central
Park.</p>

<p>"Recall our recent <i>conversazione</i> about footprints in the
snow?" asked Vance, as we emerged into Fifth Avenue and headed
south.</p>

<p>Markham nodded abstractedly.</p>

<p>"As I remember," mused Vance, "in the hypothetical case you
presented there were not only footprints but a dozen or more
witnesses&mdash;including a youthful prodigy&mdash;who saw a figure
of some kind cross the hibernal landscape...<i>Grau, teurer Freund,
ist alle Theorie!</i> Here you are in a most beastly pother because
of the disheartenin' fact that there are neither footprints in the
snow nor witnesses who saw a fleeing figure. In short, you are
bereft of both direct and circumstantial evidence...Sad, sad."</p>

<p>He wagged his head dolefully.</p>

<p>"Y' know, Markham, it appears to me that the testimony in this
case constitutes conclusive legal proof that no one could have been
with the deceased at the hour of her passing, and that,
<i>ergo,</i> she is presumably alive. The strangled body of the
lady is, I take it, simply an irrelevant circumstance from the
standpoint of legal procedure. I know that you learned lawyers
won't admit a murder without a body; but how, in sweet Heaven's
name, do you get around a <i>corpus delicti</i> without a
murder?"</p>

<p>"You're talking nonsense," Markham rebuked him, with a show of
anger.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," agreed Vance. "And yet, it's a distressin' thing
for a lawyer not to have footprints of some kind, isn't it, old
dear? It leaves one so up in the air."</p>

<p>Suddenly Markham swung round. <i>"You,</i> of course, don't need
footprints, or any other kind of material clues," he flung at Vance
tauntingly. <i>"You</i> have powers of divination such as are
denied ordinary mortals. If I remember correctly, you informed me,
somewhat grandiloquently, that, knowing the nature and conditions
of a crime, you could lead me infallibly to the culprit, whether he
left footprints or not. You recall that boast?...Well, here's a
crime, and the perpetrator left no footprints coming or going. Be
so kind as to end my suspense by confiding in me who killed the
Odell girl."</p>

<p>Vance's serenity was not ruffled by Markham's ill-humored
challenge. He sat smoking lazily for several minutes; then he
leaned over and flicked his cigarette ash out of the window.</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, Markham," he rejoined evenly, "I'm half inclined
to look into this silly murder. I think I'll wait, though, and see
whom the nonplussed Heath turns up with his inquiries."</p>

<p>Markham grunted scoffingly and sank back on the cushions. "Your
generosity wrings me," he said.</p>

<h2>9 - THE PACK IN FULL CRY</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 11; afternoon)</i>
</p>

<p>On our way downtown that morning we were delayed for a
considerable time in the traffic congestion just north of Madison
Square, and Markham anxiously looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"It's past noon," he said. "I think I'll stop at the club and
have a bite of lunch...I presume that eating at this early hour
would be too plebeian for so exquisite a hothouse flower as
you."</p>

<p>Vance considered the invitation.</p>

<p>"Since you deprived me of my breakfast," he decided, "I'll
permit you to buy me some eggs
<i>B&eacute;n&eacute;dictine."</i></p>

<p>A few minutes later we entered the almost empty grill of the
Stuyvesant Club and took a table near one of the windows looking
southward over the treetops of Madison Square.</p>

<p>Shortly after we had given our order a uniformed attendant
entered and, bowing deferentially at the district attorney's elbow,
held out an unaddressed communication sealed in one of the club's
envelopes. Markham read it with an expression of growing curiosity,
and as he studied the signature a look of mild surprise came into
his eyes. At length he looked up and nodded to the waiting
attendant. Then, excusing himself, he left us abruptly. It was
fully twenty minutes before he returned.</p>

<p>"Funny thing," he said. "That note was from the man who took the
Odell woman to dinner and the theater last night...A small world,"
he mused. "He's staying here at the club&mdash;he's a nonresident
member and makes it his headquarters when he's in town."</p>

<p>"You know him?" Vance put the question disinterestedly.</p>

<p>"I've met him several times&mdash;chap named Spotswoode."
Markham seemed perplexed. "He's a man of family, lives in a country
house on Long Island, and is regarded generally as a highly
respectable member of society&mdash;one of the last persons I'd
suspect of being mixed up with the Odell girl. But, according to
his own confession, he played around a good deal with her during
his visits to New York&mdash;'sowing a few belated wild oats,' as
he expressed it&mdash;and last night took her to Francelle's for
dinner and to the Winter Garden afterwards."</p>

<p>"Not my idea of an intellectual, or even edifyin', evening,"
commented Vance. "And he selected a deuced unlucky day for it I
say, imagine opening the morning paper and learning that your
<i>petite dame</i> of the preceding evening had been strangled!
Disconcertin', what?"</p>

<p>"He's certainly disconcerted," said Markham. "The early
afternoon papers were out about an hour ago, and he'd been phoning
my office every ten minutes, when I suddenly walked in here. He's
afraid his connection with the girl will leak out and disgrace
him."</p>

<p>"And won't it?"</p>

<p>"I hardly see the necessity. No one knows who her escort was
last evening; and since he obviously had nothing to do with the
crime, what's to be gained by dragging him into it? He told me the
whole story, and offered to stay in the city as long as I wanted
him to."</p>

<p>"I infer, from the cloud of disappointment that enveloped you
when you returned just now, that his story held nothing hopeful for
you in the way of clues."</p>

<p>"No," Markham admitted. "The girl apparently never spoke to him
of her intimate affairs; and he couldn't give me a single helpful
suggestion. His account of what happened last night agreed
perfectly with Jessup's. He called for the girl at seven, brought
her home at about eleven, stayed with her half an hour or so, and
then left her. When he heard her call for help, he was frightened,
but on being assured by her there was nothing wrong, he concluded
she had dozed off into a nightmare, and thought no more of it. He
drove direct to the club here, arriving about ten minutes to
twelve. Judge Redfern, who saw him descend from the taxi, insisted
on his coming upstairs and playing poker with some men who were
waiting in the judge's rooms for him. They played until three
o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"Your Long Island Don Juan has certainly not supplied you with
any footprints in the snow."</p>

<p>"Anyway, his coming forward at this time closes one line of
inquiry over which we might have wasted considerable time."</p>

<p>"If many more lines of inquiry are closed," remarked Vance
dryly, "you'll be in a distressin' dilemma, don't y' know."</p>

<p>"There are enough still open to keep me busy," said Markham,
pushing back his plate and calling for the check. He rose; then
pausing, regarded Vance meditatingly. "Are you sufficiently
interested to want to come along?"</p>

<p>"Eh, what? My word!...Charmed, I'm sure. But, I say, sit down
just a moment&mdash;there's a good fellow!&mdash;till I finish my
coffee."</p>

<p>I was considerably astonished at Vance's ready acceptance,
careless and bantering though it was, for there was an exhibition
of old Chinese prints at the Montross Galleries that afternoon,
which he had planned to attend. A Riokai and a Moyeki, said to be
very fine examples of Sung painting, were to be shown; and Vance
was particularly eager to acquire them for his collection.</p>

<p>We rode with Markham to the Criminal Courts building and,
entering by the Franklin Street door, took the private elevator to
the district attorney's spacious but dingy private office, which
overlooked the gray-stone ramparts of the Tombs. Vance seated
himself in one of the heavy leather-upholstered chairs near the
carved oak table on the right of the desk and lighted a cigarette
with an air of cynical amusement.</p>

<p>"I await with anticipat'ry delight the grinding of the wheels of
justice," he confided, leaning back lazily.</p>

<p>"You are doomed not to hear the first turn of those wheels,"
retorted Markham. "The initial revolution will take place outside
of this office." And he disappeared through a swinging door which
led to the judge's chambers.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he returned and sat down in the high-backed
swivel chair at his desk, with his back to the four tall narrow
windows in the south wall of the office.</p>

<p>"I just saw Judge Redfern," he explained&mdash;"it happened to
be the midday recess&mdash;and he verified Spotswoode's statement
in regard to the poker game. The judge met him outside of the club
at ten minutes before midnight, and was with him until three in the
morning. He noted the time because he had promised his guests to be
back at half past eleven and was twenty minutes late."</p>

<p>"Why all this substantiation of an obviously unimportant fact?"
asked Vance.</p>

<p>"A matter of routine," Markham told him, slightly impatient. "In
a case of this kind every factor, however seemingly remote to the
main issue, must be checked."</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, Markham"&mdash;Vance laid his head back on the
chair and gazed dreamily at the ceiling&mdash;"one would think that
this eternal routine, which you lawyer chaps worship so devoutly,
actually got one somewhere occasionally; whereas it never gets one
anywhere. Remember the Red Queen in 'Through the
Looking-Glass&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I'm too busy at present to debate the question of routine
<i>versus</i> inspiration," Markham answered brusquely, pressing a
button beneath the edge of his desk.</p>

<p>Swacker, his youthful and energetic secretary, appeared at the
door which communicated with a narrow inner chamber between the
district attorney's office and the main waiting room.</p>

<p>"Yes, Chief?" The secretary's eyes gleamed expectantly behind
his enormous horn-rimmed glasses.</p>

<p>"Tell Ben to send me in a man at once."*</p>

<p>* "Ben" was Colonel Benjamin Hanlon, the commanding officer of
the Detective Division attached to the district attorney's
office.</p>

<p>Swacker went out through the corridor door, and a minute or two
later a suave, rotund man, dressed immaculately and wearing a
pince-nez, entered, and stood before Markham with an ingratiating
smile.</p>

<p>"Morning, Tracy." Markham's tone was pleasant but curt. "Here's
a list of four witnesses in connection with the Odell case that I
want brought down here at once&mdash;the two phone operators, the
maid, and the janitor. You'll find them at 184 West 71st Street.
Sergeant Heath is holding them there."</p>

<p>"Right, sir." Tracy took the memorandum, and with a priggish,
but by no means inelegant, bow went out.</p>

<p>During the next hour Markham plunged into the general work that
had accumulated during the forenoon, and I was amazed at the man's
tremendous vitality and efficiency. He disposed of as many
important matters as would have occupied the ordinary businessman
for an entire day. Swacker bobbed in and out with electric energy,
and various clerks appeared at the touch of a buzzer, took their
orders, and were gone with breathless rapidity. Vance, who had
sought diversion in a tome of famous arson trials, looked up
admiringly from time to time and shook his head in mild reproach at
such spirited activity.</p>

<p>It was just half past two when Swacker announced the return of
Tracy with the four witnesses; and for two hours Markham questioned
and cross-questioned them with a thoroughness and an insight that
even I, as a lawyer, had rarely seen equaled. His interrogation of
the two phone operators was quite different from his casual
questioning of them earlier in the day; and if there had been a
single relevant omission in their former testimony, it would
certainly have been caught now by Markham's grueling catechism. But
when, at last, they were told they could go, no new information had
been brought to light. Their stories now stood firmly grounded: no
one&mdash;with the exception of the girl herself and her escort,
and the disappointed visitor at half past nine&mdash;had entered
the front door and passed down the hall to the Odell apartment from
seven o'clock on; and no one had passed out that way. The janitor
reiterated stubbornly that he had bolted the side door a little
after six, and no amount of wheedling or aggression could shake his
dogged certainty on that point. Amy Gibson, the maid, could add
nothing to her former testimony. Markham's intensive examination of
her produced only repetitions of what she had already told him.</p>

<p>Not one new possibility&mdash;not one new suggestion&mdash;was
brought out. In fact, the two hours' interlocutory proceedings
resulted only in closing up every loophole in a seemingly
incredible situation. When, at half past four, Markham sat back in
his chair with a weary sigh, the chance of unearthing a promising
means of approach to the astonishing problem seemed more remote
than ever.</p>

<p>Vance closed his treatise on arson and threw away his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Markham old chap"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"this case
requires umbilicular contemplation, not routine. Why not call in an
Egyptian seeress with a <i>flair</i> for crystal-gazing?"</p>

<p>"If this sort of thing goes on much longer," returned Markham
dispiritedly, "I'll be tempted to take your advice."</p>

<p>Just then Swacker looked in through the door to say that
Inspector Brenner was on the wire. Markham picked up the telephone
receiver, and as he listened he jotted down some notes on a pad.
When the call had ended, he turned to Vance.</p>

<p>"You seemed disturbed over the condition of the steel jewel case
we found in the bedroom. Well, the expert on burglar tools just
called up; and he verifies his opinion of this morning. The case
was pried open with a specially-made cold chisel such as only a
professional burglar would carry or would know how to use. It had
an inch-and-three-eighths beveled bit and a one-inch flat handle.
It was an old instrument&mdash;there was a peculiar nick in the
blade&mdash;and is the same one that was used in a successful
housebreak on upper Park Avenue early last summer... Does that
highly exciting information ameliorate your anxiety?"</p>

<p>"Can't say that it does." Vance had again become serious and
perplexed. "In fact, it makes the situation still more fantastic...
I could see a glimmer of light&mdash;eerie and unearthly, perhaps,
but still a perceptible illumination&mdash;in all this murkiness if
it wasn't for that jewel case and the steel chisel."</p>

<p>Markham was about to answer when Swacker again looked in and
informed him that Sergeant Heath had arrived and wanted to see
him.</p>

<p>Heath's manner was far less depressed than when we had taken
leave of him that morning. He accepted the cigar Markham offered
him, and seating himself at the conference table in front of the
district attorney's desk, drew out a battered notebook.</p>

<p>"We've had a little good luck," he began. "Burke and
Emery&mdash;two of the men I put on the case&mdash;got a line on
Odell at the first place they made inquiries. From what they
learned, she didn't run around with many men&mdash;limited herself
to a few live wires, and played the game with what you'd call
<i>finesse...</i> The principal one&mdash;the man who's been seen
most with her&mdash;is Charles Cleaver."</p>

<p>Markham sat up. "I know Cleaver&mdash;if it's the same one."</p>

<p>"It's him, all right," declared Heath. "Former Brooklyn Tax
Commissioner; been interested in a poolroom for pony-betting over
in Jersey City ever since. Hangs out at the Stuyvesant Club, where
he can hobnob with his old Tammany Hall cronies."</p>

<p>"That's the one," nodded Markham. "He's a kind of professional
gay dog&mdash;known as Pop, I believe."</p>

<p>Vance gazed into space.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he murmured. "So old Pop Cleaver was also
entangled with our subtle and sanguine Dolores. She certainly
couldn't have loved him for his <i>beaux yeux."</i></p>

<p>"I thought, sir," went on Heath, "that, seeing as how Cleaver is
always in and out of the Stuyvesant Club, you might ask him some
questions about Odell. He ought to know something."</p>

<p>"Glad to, Sergeant." Markham made a note on his pad. "I'll try
to get in touch with him tonight...Anyone else on your list?"</p>

<p>"There's a fellow named Mannix&mdash;Louis Mannix&mdash;who met
Odell when she was in the 'Follies'; but she chucked him over a
year ago, and they haven't been seen together since. He's got
another girl now. He's the head of the firm of Mannix and Levine,
fur importers, and is one of your nightclub rounders&mdash;a heavy
spender. But I don't see much use of barking up that tree&mdash;his
affair with Odell went cold too long ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Markham; "I think we can eliminate him."</p>

<p>"I say, if you keep up this elimination much longer," observed
Vance, "you won't have anything left but the lady's corpse."</p>

<p>"And then, there's the man who took her out last night," pursued
Heath. "Nobody seems to know his name&mdash;he must've been one of
those discreet, careful old boys. I thought at first he might have
been Cleaver, but the descriptions don't tally...And by the way,
sir, here's a funny thing: when he left Odell last night he took
the taxi down to the Stuyvesant Club and got out there."</p>

<p>Markham nodded. "I know all about that, Sergeant. And I know who
the man was; and it wasn't Cleaver."</p>

<p>Vance was chuckling. "The Stuyvesant Club seems to be well in
the forefront of this case," he said. "I do hope it doesn't suffer
the sad fate of the Knickerbocker Athletic."*</p>

<p>* Vance was here referring to the famous Molineux case, which,
in 1898, sounded the death knell of the old Knickerbocker Athletic
Club at Madison Avenue and 45th Street. But it was commercialism
that ended the Stuyvesant's career. This club, which stood on the
north side of Madison Square, was razed a few years later to make
room for a skyscraper.</p>

<p>Heath was intent on the main issue.</p>

<p>"Who was the man, Mr. Markham?"</p>

<p>Markham hesitated, as if pondering the advisability of taking
the other into his confidence. Then he said: "I'll tell you his
name, but in strict confidence. The man was Kenneth
Spotswoode."</p>

<p>He then recounted the story of his being called away from lunch,
and of his failure to elicit any helpful suggestions from
Spotswoode. He also informed Heath of his verification of the man's
statements regarding his movements after meeting Judge Redfern at
the club.</p>

<p>"And," added Markham, "since he obviously left the girl before
she was murdered, there's no necessity to bother him. In fact, I
gave him my word I'd keep him out of it for his family's sake."</p>

<p>"If you're satisfied, sir, I am." Heath closed his notebook and
put it away. "There's just one other little thing. Odell used to
live on 110th Street, and Emery dug up her former landlady and
learned that this fancy guy the maid told us about used to call on
her regularly."</p>

<p>"That reminds me, Sergeant." Markham picked up the memorandum he
had made during Inspector Brenner's phone call. "Here's some data
the Professor gave me about the forcing of the jewel case."</p>

<p>Heath studied the paper with considerable eagerness. "Just as I
thought!" He nodded his head with satisfaction. "Clear-cut
professional job, by somebody who's been in the line of work
before."</p>

<p>Vance roused himself. "Still, if such is the case," he said,
"why did this experienced burglar first use the insufficient poker?
And why did he overlook the living room clothes press?"</p>

<p>"I'll find all that out, Mr. Vance, when I get my hands on him,"
asserted Heath, with a hard look in his eyes. "And the guy I want
to have a nice quiet little chat with is the one with the pleated
silk shirt and the chamois gloves."</p>

<p><i>"Chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t,"</i> sighed Vance. "For
myself, I have no yearning whatever to hold converse with him.
Somehow, I can't just picture a professional looter trying to rend
a steel box with a cast iron poker."</p>

<p>"Forget the poker," Heath advised gruffly. "He jimmied the box
with a steel chisel; and that same chisel was used last summer in
another burglary on Park Avenue. What about
<i>that</i><i>?"</i></p>

<p>"Ah! That's what torments me, Sergeant. If it wasn't for that
disturbin' fact, d' ye see, I'd be lightsome and <i>sans souci</i>
this afternoon, inviting my soul over a dish of tea at
Claremont."</p>

<p>Detective Bellamy was announced, and Heath sprang to his feet.
"That'll mean news about those fingerprints," he prophesied
hopefully.</p>

<p>Bellamy entered unemotionally and walked up to the district
attorney's desk.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Dubois sent me over," he said. "He thought you'd want the
report on those Odell prints." He reached into his pocket and drew
out a small flat folder which, at a sign from Markham, he handed to
Heath. "We identified 'em. Both made by the same hand, like Cap'n
Dubois said: and that hand belonged to Tony Skeel."</p>

<p>"'Dude' Skeel, eh?" The sergeant's tone was vibrant with
suppressed excitement. "Say, Mr. Markham, that gets us somewhere.
Skeel's an ex-convict and an artist in his line."</p>

<p>He opened the folder and took out an oblong card and a sheet of
blue paper containing eight or ten lines of typewriting. He studied
the card, gave a satisfied grunt, and handed it to Markham. Vance
and I stepped up and looked at it. At the top was the familiar
rogues' gallery photograph showing the full face and profile of a
regular-featured youth with thick hair and a square chin. His eyes
were wide-set and pale, and he wore a small, evenly trimmed
moustache with waxed, needlepoint ends. Below the double photograph
was a brief tabulated description of its sitter, giving his name,
aliases, residence, and Bertillon measurements, and designating the
character of his illegal profession. Underneath were ten little
squares arranged in two rows, each containing a fingerprint impress
made in black ink&mdash;the upper row being the impressions of the
right hand, the lower row those of the left.</p>

<p>"So that's the <i>arbiter elegantiarum</i> who introduced the
silk shirt for full-dress wear! My word!" Vance regarded the
identification card satirically. "I wish he'd start a craze for
gaiters with dinner jackets&mdash;these New York theaters are
frightfully drafty in winter."</p>

<p>Heath put the card back in the folder and glanced over the
typewritten paper that had accompanied it.</p>

<p>"He's our man, and no mistake, Mr. Markham. Listen to this:
'Tony (Dude) Skeel. Two years Elmira Reformatory, 1902 to 1904. One
year in the Baltimore County jail for petit larceny, 1906. Three
years in San Quentin for assault and robbery, 1908 to 1911.
Arrested Chicago for housebreaking, 1912; case dismissed. Arrested
and tried for burglary in Albany, 1913; no conviction. Served two
years and eight months in Sing-Sing for housebreaking and burglary,
1914 to 1916.'" He folded the paper and put it, with the card, into
his breast pocket. "Sweet little record."</p>

<p>"That dope what you wanted?" asked the imperturbable
Bellamy.</p>

<p>"I'll say!" Heath was almost jovial.</p>

<p>Bellamy lingered expectantly with one eye on the district
attorney; and Markham, as if suddenly remembering something, took
out a box of cigars and held it out.</p>

<p>"Much obliged, sir," said Bellamy, helping himself to two Mi
Favoritas; and putting them into his waistcoat pocket with great
care, he went out.</p>

<p>"I'll use your phone now, if you don't mind, Mr. Markham," said
Heath.</p>

<p>He called the Homicide Bureau.</p>

<p>"Look up Tony Skeel&mdash;Dude Skeel&mdash;pronto, and bring him
in as soon as you find him," were his orders to Snitkin. "Get his
address from the files and take Burke and Emery with you. If he's
hopped it, send out a general alarm and have him picked
up&mdash;some of the boys'll have a line on him. Lock him up
without booking him, see?...And, listen. Search his room for
burglar tools: he probably won't have any laying around, but I
specially want a one-and-three-eighths-inch chisel with a nick in
the blade...I'll be at headquarters in half an hour."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and rubbed his hands together.</p>

<p>"Now we're sailing," he rejoiced.</p>

<p>Vance had gone to the window and stood staring down on the
"Bridge of Sighs," his hands thrust deep into his pockets. Slowly
he turned, and fixed Heath with a contemplative eye.</p>

<p>"It simply won't do, don't y' know," he asserted. "Your friend,
the Dude may have ripped open that bally box, but his head isn't
the right shape for the rest of last evening's performance."</p>

<p>Heath was contemptuous. "Not being a phrenologist, I'm going by
the shape of his fingerprints."</p>

<p>"A woeful error in the technic of criminal approach, <i>sergente
mio,"</i> replied Vance dulcetly. "The question of culpability in
this case isn't so simple as you imagine. It's deuced complicated.
And this glass of fashion and mold of form whose portrait you're
carryin' next to your heart has merely added to its intricacy."</p>

<h2>10 - A FORCED INTERVIEW</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 11; 8 P.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Markham dined at the Stuyvesant Club, as was his custom, and at
his invitation Vance and I remained with him. He no doubt figured
that our presence at the dinner table would act as a bulwark
against the intrusion of casual acquaintances; for he was in no
mood for the pleasantries of the curious. Rain had begun to fall
late in the afternoon, and when dinner was over, it had turned into
a steady downpour which threatened to last well into the night.
Dinner over, the three of us sought a secluded corner of the lounge
room, and settled ourselves for a protracted smoke.</p>

<p>We had been there less than a quarter of an hour when a slightly
rotund man, with a heavy, florid face and thin gray hair, strolled
up to us with a stealthy, self-assured gait, and wished Markham a
jovial good evening. Though I had not met the newcomer I knew him
to be Charles Cleaver.</p>

<p>"Got your note at the desk saying you wanted to see me." He
spoke with a voice curiously gentle for a man of his size; but, for
all its gentleness, there was in it a timbre of calculation and
coldness.</p>

<p>Markham rose and, after shaking hands, introduced him to Vance
and me&mdash;though, it seemed, Vance had known him slightly for
some time. He took the chair Markham indicated, and, producing a
Corona Corona, he carefully cut the end with a gold clipper
attached to his heavy watch chain, rolled the cigar between his
lips to dampen it and lighted it in closely cupped hands.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Cleaver," began Markham, "but, as
you probably have read, a young woman by the name of Margaret Odell
was murdered last night in her apartment in 71st Street..."</p>

<p>He paused. He seemed to be considering just how he could best
broach a subject so obviously delicate; and perhaps he hoped that
Cleaver would volunteer the fact of his acquaintance with the girl.
But not a muscle of the man's face moved; and, after a moment,
Markham continued.</p>

<p>"In making inquiries into the young woman's life I learned that
you, among others, were fairly well acquainted with her."</p>

<p>Again he paused. Cleaver lifted his eyebrows almost
imperceptibly but said nothing.</p>

<p>"The fact is," went on Markham, a trifle annoyed by the other's
deliberately circumspect attitude, "my report states that you were
seen with her on many occasions during a period of nearly two
years. Indeed, the only inference to be drawn from what I've
learned is that you were more than casually interested in Miss
Odell."</p>

<p>"Yes?" The query was as noncommittal as it was gentle.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated Markham. "And I may add, Mr. Cleaver, that this
is not the time for pretenses or suppressions. I am talking to you
tonight, in large measure <i>ex officio,</i> because it occurred to
me that you could give me some assistance in clearing the matter
up. I think it only fair to say that a certain man is now under
grave suspicion, and we hope to arrest him very soon. But, in any
event, we will need help, and that is why I requested this little
chat with you at the club."</p>

<p>"And how can I assist you?" Cleaver's face remained blank; only
his lips moved as he put the question.</p>

<p>"Knowing this young woman as well as you did," explained Markham
patiently, "you are no doubt in possession of some
information&mdash;certain facts or confidences, let us
say&mdash;which would throw light on her brutal, and apparently
unexpected, murder."</p>

<p>Cleaver was silent for some time. His eyes had shifted to the
wall before him, but otherwise his features remained set.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't accommodate you," he said at length.</p>

<p>"Your attitude is not quite what might be expected in one whose
conscience is entirely clear," returned Markham, with a show of
resentment.</p>

<p>The man turned a mildly inquisitive gaze upon the district
attorney.</p>

<p>"What has my knowing the girl to do with her being murdered? She
didn't confide in me who her murderer was to be. She didn't even
tell me that she knew anyone who intended to strangle her. If she'd
known, she most likely could have avoided being murdered."</p>

<p>Vance was sitting close to me, a little removed from the others,
and, leaning over, murmured in my ear <i>sotto voce:</i> "Markham's
up against another lawyer&mdash;poor dear!...A crumplin'
situation."</p>

<p>But however inauspiciously this interlocutory skirmish may have
begun, it soon developed into a grim combat which ended in
Cleaver's complete surrender. Markham, despite his suavity and
graciousness, was an unrelenting and resourceful antagonist; and it
was not long before he had forced from Cleaver some highly
significant information.</p>

<p>In response to the man's ironically evasive rejoinder, he turned
quickly and leaned forward.</p>

<p>"You're not on the witness stand in your own defense, Mr.
Cleaver," he said sharply, "however much you appear to regard
yourself as eligible for that position."</p>

<p>Cleaver glared back fixedly without replying; and Markham, his
eyelids level, studied the man opposite, determined to decipher all
he could from the other's phlegmatic countenance. But Cleaver was
apparently just as determined that his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>
should decipher absolutely nothing; and the features that met
Markham's scrutiny were as arid as a desert. At length Markham sank
back in his chair.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter particularly," he remarked indifferently,
"whether you discuss the matter or not here in the club tonight. If
you prefer to be brought to my office in the morning by a sheriff
with a subpoena, I'll be only too glad to accommodate you."</p>

<p>"That's up to you," Cleaver told him hostilely.</p>

<p>"And what's printed in the newspapers about it will be up to the
reporters," rejoined Markham. "I'll explain the situation to them
and give them a verbatim report of the interview."</p>

<p>"But I've nothing to tell you." The other's tone was suddenly
conciliatory; the idea of publicity was evidently highly
distasteful to him.</p>

<p>"So you informed me before," said Markham coldly. "Therefore I
wish you good evening."</p>

<p>He turned to Vance and me with the air of a man who had
terminated an unpleasant episode.</p>

<p>Cleaver, however, made no move to go. He smoked thoughtfully for
a minute or two; then he gave a short, hard laugh which did not
even disturb the contours of his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" he grumbled, with forced good nature. "As you said,
I'm not on the witness stand...What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"I've told you the situation." Markham's voice betrayed a
curious irritation. "You know the sort of thing I want. How did
this Odell girl live? Who were her intimates? Who would have been
likely to want her out of the way? What enemies had
she?&mdash;Anything that might lead us to an explanation of her
death...And incidentally," he added with tartness, "anything
that'll eliminate yourself from any suspected participation, direct
or indirect, in the affair."</p>

<p>Cleaver stiffened at these last words and started to protest
indignantly. But immediately he changed his tactics. Smiling
contemptuously, he took out a leather pocket case and, extracting a
small folded paper, handed it to Markham.</p>

<p>"I can eliminate myself easily enough," he proclaimed, with easy
confidence. "There's a speeding summons from Boonton, New Jersey.
Note the date and the time: September the tenth&mdash;last
night&mdash;at half past eleven. Was driving down to Hopatcong, and
was ticketed by a motorcycle cop just as I had passed Boonton and
was heading for Mountain Lakes. Got to appear in court there
tomorrow morning. Damn nuisance, these country constables." He gave
Markham a long, calculating look. "You couldn't square it for me,
could you? It's a rotten ride to Jersey, and I've got a lot to do
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Markham, who had inspected the summons casually, put it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to it for you," he promised, smiling amiably. "Now
tell me what you know."</p>

<p>Cleaver puffed meditatively on his cigar. Then, leaning back and
crossing his knees, he spoke with apparent candor.</p>

<p>"I doubt if I know much that'll help you...I liked the Canary,
as she was called&mdash;in fact, was pretty much attached to her at
one time. Did a number of foolish things; wrote her a lot of
damn-fool letters when I went to Cuba last year. Even had my
picture taken with her down at Atlantic City." He made a
self-condemnatory grimace. "Then she began to get cool and distant;
broke several appointments with me. I raised the devil with her,
but the only answer I got was a demand for money..."</p>

<p>He stopped and looked down at his cigar ash. A venomous hatred
gleamed from his narrowed eyes, and the muscles of his jowls
hardened.</p>

<p>"No use lying about it. She had those letters and things, and
she touched me for a neat little sum before I got 'em back..."</p>

<p>"When was this?"</p>

<p>There was a momentary hesitation. "Last June," Cleaver replied.
Then he hurried on: "Mr. Markham"&mdash;his voice was
bitter&mdash;"I don't want to throw mud on a dead person; but that
woman was the shrewdest, coldest-blooded blackmailer it's ever been
my misfortune to meet. And I'll say this, too: I wasn't the only
easy mark she squeezed. She had others on her string...I happen to
know she once dug into old Louey Mannix for a plenty&mdash;he told
me about it."</p>

<p>"Could you give me the names of any of these other men?" asked
Markham, attempting to dissemble his eagerness. "I've already heard
of the Mannix episode."</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't." Cleaver spoke regretfully. "I've seen the
Canary here and there with different men; and there's one in
particular I've noticed lately. But they were all strangers to
me."</p>

<p>"I suppose the Mannix affair is dead and buried by this
time?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ancient history. You won't get any line on the
situation from that angle. But there are others&mdash;more recent
than Mannix&mdash;who might bear looking into, if you could find
them. I'm easygoing myself; take things as they come. But there's a
lot of men who'd go red-headed if she did the things to them that
she did to me."</p>

<p>Cleaver, despite his confession, did not strike me as easygoing,
but rather as a cold, self-contained, nerveless person whose
immobility was at all times dictated by policy and expediency.</p>

<p>Markham studied him closely.</p>

<p>"You think, then, her death may have been due to vengeance on
the part of some disillusioned admirer?"</p>

<p>Cleaver carefully considered his answer. "Seems reasonable," he
said finally. "She was riding for a fall."</p>

<p>There was a short silence; then Markham asked: "Do you happen to
know of a young man she was interested in&mdash;good-looking,
small, blond moustache, light blue eyes&mdash;named Skeel?"</p>

<p>Cleaver snorted derisively. "That wasn't the Canary's
specialty&mdash;she let the young ones alone, as far as I
know."</p>

<p>At this moment a pageboy approached Cleaver and bowed. "Sorry to
disturb you, sir, but there's a phone call for your brother. Party
said it was important and, as your brother isn't in the club now,
the operator thought you might know where he'd gone."</p>

<p>"How would I know?" fumed Cleaver. "Don't ever bother me with
his calls."</p>

<p>"Your brother in the city?" asked Markham casually. "I met him
years ago. He's a San Franciscan, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;rabid Californian. He's visiting New York for a
couple of weeks so he'll appreciate Frisco more when he gets
back."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that this information was given reluctantly; and
I got the impression that Cleaver, for some reason, was annoyed.
But Markham, apparently, was too absorbed in the problem before him
to take notice of the other's disgruntled air, for he reverted at
once to the subject of the murder. "I happen to know one man who
has been interested in the Odell woman recently; he may be the same
one you've seen her with&mdash;tall, about forty-five, and wears a
gray, closed-cropped moustache." (He was, I knew, describing
Spotswoode.)</p>

<p>"That's the man," averred Cleaver. "Saw them together only last
week at Mouquin's."</p>

<p>Markham was disappointed. "Unfortunately, he's checked off the
list...But there must be somebody who was in the girl's confidence.
You're sure you couldn't cudgel your brains to my advantage?"</p>

<p>Cleaver appeared to think.</p>

<p>"If it's merely a question of someone who had her confidence,"
he said, "I might suggest Doctor Lindquist&mdash;first name's
Ambroise, I think; and he lives somewhere in the Forties near
Lexington Avenue. But I don't know that he'd be of any value to
you. Still, he was pretty close to her at one time."</p>

<p>"You mean that this Doctor Lindquist might have been interested
in her otherwise than professionally?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like to say." Cleaver smoked for a while as if
inwardly debating the situation. "Anyway, here are the facts:
Lindquist is one of these exclusive society specialists&mdash;a
neurologist he calls himself&mdash;and I believe he's the head of a
private sanitarium of some kind for nervous women. He must have
money, and, of course, his social standing is a vital asset to
him&mdash;just the sort of man the Canary might have selected as a
source of income. And I know this: he came to see her a good deal
oftener than a doctor of his type would be apt to. I ran into him
one night at her apartment, and when she introduced us, he wasn't
even civil."</p>

<p>"It will at least bear looking into," replied Markham
unenthusiastically. "You've no one else in mind who might know
something helpful?"</p>

<p>Cleaver shook his head.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no one."</p>

<p>"And she never mentioned anything to you that indicated she was
in fear of anyone, or anticipated trouble?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. Fact is, I was bowled over by the news. I never
read any paper but the morning <i>Herald</i>&mdash;except, of
course, <i>The Daily Racing Form</i> at night. And as there was no
account of the murder in this morning's paper, I didn't hear about
it until just before dinner. The boys in the billiard room were
talking about it, and I went out and looked at an afternoon paper.
If it hadn't been for that, I might not have known of it till
tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>Markham discussed the case with him until half past eight but
could elicit no further suggestions. Finally Cleaver rose to
go.</p>

<p>"Sorry I couldn't give you more help," he said. His rubicund
face was beaming now, and he shook hands with Markham in the
friendliest fashion.</p>

<p>"You wangled that viscid old sport rather cleverly, don't y'
know," remarked Vance, when Cleaver had gone. "But there's
something deuced queer about him. The transition from his gambler's
glassy stare to his garrulous confidences was too
sudden&mdash;suspiciously sudden, in fact. I may be evil-minded,
but he didn't impress me as a luminous pillar of truth. Maybe it's
because I don't like those cold, boiled eyes of his&mdash;somehow
they didn't harmonize with his gushing imitation of openhearted
frankness."</p>

<p>"We can allow him something for his embarrassing position,"
suggested Markham charitably. "It isn't exactly pleasant to admit
having been taken in and blackmailed by a charmer."</p>

<p>"Still, if he got his letters back in June, why did he continue
paying court to the lady? Heath reported he was active in that
sector right up to the end."</p>

<p>"He may be the complete amorist," smiled Markham.</p>

<p>"Some like Abra, what?&mdash;</p>

<p>'Abra was ready ere I call'd her name;<br>
And, though I call'd another, Abra came.'</p>

<p>Maybe&mdash;yes. He might qualify as a modern Cayley
Drummle."</p>

<p>"At any rate, he gave us, in Doctor Lindquist, a possible source
of information."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed Vance. "And that's about the only point of
his whole passionate unfoldment that I particularly put any stock
in, because it was the only point he indicated with any decent
reticence...My advice is that you interview this Aesculapius of the
fair sex without further delay."</p>

<p>"I'm dog-tired," objected Markham. "Let it wait till
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Vance glanced at the great clock over the stone mantel.</p>

<p>"It's latish, I'll admit, but why not, as Pittacus advised,
seize time by the forelock?</p>

<p>'Who lets slip fortune, her shall never find:<br>
Occasion once past by, is a bald behind.'</p>

<p>But the elder Cato anticipated Cowley. In his 'Disticha de
Moribus' he wrote: <i>Fronte capillata&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>"Come!" pleaded Markham, rising. "Anything to dam this flow of
erudition."</p>

<h2>11 - SEEKING INFORMATION</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday September 11; 9 P.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Ten minutes later we were ringing the bell of a stately old
brownstone house in East 44th Street.</p>

<p>A resplendently caparisoned butler opened the door, and Markham
presented his card.</p>

<p>"Take this to the doctor at once and say that it's urgent."</p>

<p>"The doctor is just finishing dinner," the stately seneschal
informed him, and conducted us into a richly furnished reception
room, with deep, comfortable chairs, silken draperies, and subdued
lights.</p>

<p>"A typical gynecologist's seraglio," observed Vance, looking
around. "I'm sure the pasha himself is a majestic and elegant
personage."</p>

<p>The prediction proved true. Doctor Lindquist entered the room a
moment later inspecting the district attorney's card as if it had
been a cuneiform inscription whose import he could not quite
decipher. He was a tall man in his late forties, with bushy hair
and eyebrows, and a complexion abnormally pale. His face was long,
and, despite the asymmetry of his features, he might easily have
been called handsome. He was in dinner clothes, and he carried
himself with the self-conscious precision of a man unduly impressed
with his own importance. He seated himself at a kidney-shaped desk
of carved mahogany and lifted his eyes with polite inquiry to
Markham.</p>

<p>"To what am I indebted for the honor of this call?" he asked in
a studiously melodious voice, lingering over each word caressingly.
"You are most fortunate to have found me in," he added, before
Markham could speak. "I confer with patients only by appointment."
One felt that he experienced a certain humiliation at having
received us without elaborate ceremonial preliminaries.</p>

<p>Markham, whose nature was opposed to all circumlocution and
pretense, came direct to the point.</p>

<p>"This isn't a professional consultation, Doctor; but it happens
that I want to speak to you about one of your former
patients&mdash;a Miss Margaret Odell."</p>

<p>Doctor Lindquist regarded the gold paperweight before him with
vacantly reminiscent eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Miss Odell. I was just reading of her violent end. A
most unfortunate and tragic affair...In just what way can I be of
service to you?&mdash;You understand, of course, that the
relationship between a physician and his patient is one of sacred
confidence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand that thoroughly," Markham assured him abruptly.
"On the other hand, it is the sacred duty of every citizen to
assist the authorities in bringing a murderer to justice. And if
there is anything you can tell me which will help toward that end,
I shall certainly expect you to tell me."</p>

<p>The doctor raised his hand slightly in polite protestation. "I
shall, of course, do all I can to assist you, if you will but
indicate your desires."</p>

<p>"There's no need to beat about the bush, Doctor," said Markham.
"I know that Miss Odell was a patient of yours for a long time; and
I realize that it is highly possible, not to say probable, that she
told you certain personal things which may have direct bearing on
her death."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Mr.&mdash;," Doctor Lindquist glanced
ostentatiously at the card, "ah&mdash;Markham, my relations with
Miss Odell were of a purely professional character."</p>

<p>"I had understood, however," ventured Markham, "that, while what
you say may be technically true, nevertheless there was an
informality, let me say, in that relationship. Perhaps I may state
it better by saying that your professional attitude transcended a
merely scientific interest in her case."</p>

<p>I heard Vance chuckle softly; and I myself could hardly suppress
a smile at Markham's verbose and orbicular accusation. But Doctor
Lindquist, it seemed, was in no wise disconcerted. Assuming an air
of beguiling pensiveness, he said: "I will confess, in the
interests of strict accuracy, that during my somewhat protracted
treatment of her case, I came to regard the young woman with a
certain&mdash;shall I say, fatherly liking? But I doubt if she was
even aware of this mild sentiment on my part."</p>

<p>The corners of Vance's mouth twitched slightly. He was sitting
with drowsy eyes, watching the doctor with a look of studious
amusement.</p>

<p>"And she never at any time told you of any private or personal
affairs that were causing her anxiety?" persisted Markham.</p>

<p>Doctor Lindquist pyramided his fingers, and appeared to give the
question his undivided thought.</p>

<p>"No, I can't recall a single statement of that nature." His
words were measured and urbane. "I know, naturally, in a general
way, her manner of living; but the details, you will readily
perceive, were wholly outside my province as a medical consultant.
The disorganization of her nerves was due&mdash;so my diagnosis led
me to conclude&mdash;to late hours, excitement, irregular and rich
eating&mdash;what, I believe, is referred to vulgarly as going the
pace. The modern woman, in this febrile age, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When did you see her last, may I ask?" Markham interrupted
impatiently.</p>

<p>The doctor made a pantomime of eloquent surprise.</p>

<p>"When did I see her last?...Let me see." He could, apparently,
recall the occasion only with considerable difficulty. "A fortnight
ago, perhaps&mdash;though it may have been longer. I really can't
recall...Shall I refer to my files?"</p>

<p>"That won't be necessary," said Markham. He paused and regarded
the doctor with a look of disarming affability. "And was this last
visit a paternal or merely a professional one?"</p>

<p>"Professional, of course." Doctor Lindquist's eyes were
impassive and only mildly interested; but his face, I felt, was by
no means the unedited reflection of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Did the meeting take place here or at her apartment?"</p>

<p>"I believe I called on her at her home."</p>

<p>"You called on her a great deal, Doctor&mdash;so I am
informed&mdash;and at rather unconventional hours...Is this
entirely in accord with your practice of seeing patients only by
appointment?"</p>

<p>Markham's tone was pleasant; but from the nature of his question
I knew that he was decidedly irritated by the man's bland
hypocrisy, and felt that he was deliberately withholding relevant
information.</p>

<p>Before Doctor Lindquist could reply, however, the butler
appeared at the door and silently indicated an extension telephone
on a taboret beside the desk. With an unctuously murmured apology,
the doctor turned and lifted the receiver.</p>

<p>Vance took advantage of this opportunity to scribble something
on a piece of paper and pass it surreptitiously to Markham.</p>

<p>His call completed, Doctor Lindquist drew himself up haughtily
and faced Markham with chilling scorn.</p>

<p>"Is it the function of the district attorney," he asked
distantly, "to harrass respectable physicians with insulting
questions? I did not know that it was illegal&mdash;or even
original, for that matter&mdash;for a doctor to visit his
patients."</p>

<p>"I am not discussing <i>now</i>"&mdash;Markham emphasized the
adverb&mdash;"your infractions of the law; but since you suggest a
possibility which, I assure you, was not in my mind, would you be
good enough to tell me&mdash;merely as a matter of form&mdash;where
you were last night between eleven and twelve?"</p>

<p>The question produced a startling effect. Doctor Lindquist
became suddenly like a tautly drawn rope, and rising slowly and
stiffly, he glared, with cold intense venom, at the district
attorney. His velvety mask had fallen off; and I detected another
emotion beneath his repressed anger: his expression cloaked a fear,
and his wrath but partly veiled a passionate uncertainty.</p>

<p>"My whereabouts last night is no concern of yours." He spoke
with great effort, his breath coming and going noisily.</p>

<p>Markham waited, apparently unmoved, his eyes riveted on the
trembling man before him. This calm scrutiny completely broke down
the other's self-control.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by forcing yourself in here with your
contemptible insinuations?" he shouted. His face, now livid and
mottled, was hideously contorted; his hands made spasmodic
movements; and his whole body shook as with a tremor. "Get out of
here&mdash;you and your two myrmidons! Get out, before I have you
thrown out!"</p>

<p>Markham, himself enraged now, was about to reply, when Vance
took him by the arm.</p>

<p>"The doctor is gently hinting that we go," he said. And with
amazing swiftness he spun Markham round and led him firmly out of
the room.</p>

<p>When we were again in the taxicab on our way back to the club,
Vance sniggered gaily. "A sweet specimen, that! Paranoia. Or, more
likely, manic-depressive insanity&mdash;the <i>folie</i>
<i>circulaire</i> type: recurring periods of maniacal excitement
alternating with periods of the clearest sanity, don't y' know.
Anyway, the doctor's disorder belongs in the category of
psychoses&mdash;associated with the maturation or waning of the
sexual instinct. He's just the right age, too. Neurotic
degenerate&mdash;that's what this oily Hippocrates is. In another
minute he would have attacked you...My word! It's a good thing I
came to the rescue. Such chaps are about as safe as
rattlesnakes."</p>

<p>He shook his head in a mock discouragement.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, Markham, old thing," he added, "you should
study the cranial indications of your fellow man more
carefully&mdash;<i>vultus</i> <i>est index animi.</i> Did you, by
any chance, note the gentleman's wide rectangular forehead, his
irregular eyebrows, and pale luminous eyes, and his outstanding
ears with their thin upper rims, their pointed tragi and split
lobes?...A clever devil, this Ambroise&mdash;but a moral imbecile.
Beware of those pseudopyriform faces, Markham; leave their
Apollonian Greek suggestiveness to misunderstood women."</p>

<p>"I wonder what he really knows?" grumbled Markham irritably.</p>

<p>"Oh, he knows something&mdash;rest assured of that! And if only
we knew it, too, we'd be considerably further along in the
investigation. Furthermore, the information he is hiding is
somewhat unpleasantly connected with himself. His euphoria is a bit
shaken. He frightfully overdid the grand manner; his valedict'ry
fulmination was the true expression of his feeling toward us."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Markham. "That question about last night acted
like a petard. What prompted you to suggest my asking it?"</p>

<p>"A number of things&mdash;his gratuitous and obviously
mendacious statement that he had just read of the murder; his
wholly insincere homily on the sacredness of professional
confidences; the cautious and Pecksniffian confession of his
fatherly regard for the girl; his elaborate struggle to remember
when he had last seen her&mdash;this particularly, I think, made me
suspicious; and then, the psychopathic indicants of his
physiognomy."</p>

<p>"Well," admitted Markham, "the question had its effect...I feel
that I shall see this fashionable M.D. again."</p>

<p>"You will," iterated Vance. "We took him unawares. But when he
has had time to ponder the matter and concoct an appealin' tale,
he'll become downright garrulous...Anyhow, the evening is over, and
you can meditate on buttercups till the morrow."</p>

<p>But the evening was not quite over as far as the Odell case was
concerned. We had been back in the lounge room of the club but a
short time when a man walked by the corner in which we sat, and
bowed with formal courtesy to Markham. Markham, to my surprise,
rose and greeted him, at the same time indicating a chair.</p>

<p>"There's something further I wanted to ask you, Mr. Spotswoode,"
he said, "if you can spare a moment."</p>

<p>At the mention of the name I regarded the man closely, for, I
confess, I was not a little curious about the anonymous escort who
had taken the girl to dinner and the theater the night before.
Spotswoode was a typical New England aristocrat, inflexible, slow
in his movements, reserved, and quietly but modishly dressed. His
hair and moustache were slightly gray&mdash;which, no doubt,
enhanced the pinkness of his complexion. He was just under six feet
tall and well proportioned, but a trifle angular.</p>

<p>Markham introduced him to Vance and me, and briefly explained
that we were working with him on the case and that he had thought
it best to take us fully into his confidence.</p>

<p>Spotswoode gave him a dubious look but immediately bowed his
acceptance of the decision.</p>

<p>"I'm in your hands, Mr. Markham," he replied, in a well-bred but
somewhat high-pitched voice, "and I concur, of course, with
whatever you think advisable." He turned to Vance with an
apologetic smile. "I'm in a rather unpleasant position and
naturally feel a little sensitive about it."</p>

<p>"I'm something of an antinomian," Vance pleasantly informed him.
"At any rate, I'm not a moralist; so my attitude in the matter is
quite academic."</p>

<p>Spotswoode laughed softly. "I wish my family held a similar
point of view; but I'm afraid they would not be so tolerant of my
foibles."</p>

<p>"It's only fair to tell you, Mr. Spotswoode," interposed
Markham, "that there is a bare possibility I may have to call you
as a witness."</p>

<p>The man looked up quickly, his face clouding over, but he made
no comment.</p>

<p>"The fact is," continued Markham, "we are about to make an
arrest, and your testimony may be needed to establish the time of
Miss Odell's return to her apartment, and also to substantiate the
fact that there was presumably someone in her room after you had
left. Her screams and calls for help, which you heard, may prove
vital evidence in obtaining a conviction."</p>

<p>Spotswoode seemed rather appalled at the thought of his
relations with the girl becoming public, and for several minutes he
sat with averted eyes.</p>

<p>"I see your point," he acknowledged at length. "But it would be
a terrible thing for me if the fact of my delinquencies became
known."</p>

<p>"That contingency may be entirely avoided," Markham encouraged
him. "I promise you that you will not be called upon unless it is
absolutely necessary...And now, what I especially wanted to ask you
is this: do you happen to know a Doctor Lindquist, who, I
understand, was Miss Odell's personal physician?"</p>

<p>Spotswoode was frankly puzzled. "I never heard the name," he
answered. "In fact, Miss Odell never mentioned any doctor to
me."</p>

<p>"And did you ever hear her mention the name of Skeel...or refer
to any one as Tony?"</p>

<p>"Never." His answer was emphatic.</p>

<p>Markham lapsed into a disappointed silence. Spotswoode, too, was
silent; he sat as if in a revery.</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Markham," he said, after several minutes, "I
ought to be ashamed to admit it, but the truth is I cared a good
deal for the girl. I suppose you've kept her apartment intact..."
He hesitated, and a look almost of appeal came into his eyes. "I'd
like to see it again if I could."</p>

<p>Markham regarded him sympathetically but finally shook his
head.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do. You'd be sure to be recognized by the
operator&mdash;or there might be a reporter about&mdash;and then
I'd be unable to keep you out of the case."</p>

<p>The man appeared disappointed but did not protest; and for
several minutes no one spoke. Then Vance raised himself slightly in
his chair.</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Spotswoode, do you happen to remember anything
unusual occurring last night during the half hour you remained with
Miss Odell after the theater?"</p>

<p>"Unusual?" the man's manner was eloquent of his astonishment.
"To the contrary. We chatted awhile, and then, as she seemed tired,
I said good night and came away, making a luncheon appointment with
her for today."</p>

<p>"And yet, it now seems fairly certain that some other man was
hiding in the apartment when you were there."</p>

<p>"There's little doubt on that point," agreed Spotswoode, with
the suggestion of a shudder. "And her screams would seem to
indicate that he came forth from hiding a few minutes after I
went."</p>

<p>"And you had no suspicion of the fact when you heard her call
for help?"</p>

<p>"I did at first&mdash;naturally. But when she assured me that
nothing was the matter, and told me to go home, I attributed her
screams to a nightmare. I knew she had been tired, and I had left
her in the wicker chair near the door, from where her screams
seemed to come; so I naturally concluded she had dozed off and
called out in her sleep...If only I hadn't taken so much for
granted!"</p>

<p>"It's a harrowin' situation." Vance was silent for a while; then
he asked: "Did you, by any chance, notice the door of the living
room closet? Was it open or closed?"</p>

<p>Spotswoode frowned, as if attempting to visualize the picture;
but the result was a failure.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was closed. I probably would have noticed it if it
had been open."</p>

<p>"Then, you couldn't say if the key was in the lock or not?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no! I don't even know if it ever had a key."</p>

<p>The case was discussed for another half hour; then Spotswoode
excused himself and left us.</p>

<p>"Funny thing," ruminated Markham, "how a man of his upbringing
could be so attracted by the empty-headed, butterfly type."</p>

<p>"I'd say it was quite natural," returned Vance..."You're such an
incorrigible moralist, Markham."</p>

<h2>12 - CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</h2>

<p><i>(Wednesday, September 12; 9 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>The following day, which was Wednesday, not only brought forth
an important and, as it appeared, conclusive development in the
Odell case but marked the beginning of Vance's active cooperation
in the proceedings. The psychological elements in the case had
appealed to him irresistibly, and he felt, even at this stage of
the investigation, that a final answer could never be obtained
along the usual police lines. At his request Markham had called for
him at a little before nine o'clock, and we had driven direct to
the district attorney's office.</p>

<p>Heath was waiting impatiently when we arrived. His eager and
covertly triumphant expression plainly indicated good news.</p>

<p>"Things are breaking fine and dandy," he announced, when we had
sat down. He himself was too elated to relax, and stood between
Markham's desk rolling a large black cigar between his fingers. "We
got the Dude&mdash;six o'clock yesterday evening&mdash;and we got
him right. One of the C. O. boys, named Riley, who was patroling
Sixth Avenue in the Thirties, saw him swing off a surface car and
head for McAnerny's Pawn Shop. Right away Riley wigwags the traffic
officer on the corner and follows the Dude into McAnerny's. Pretty
soon the traffic officer comes in with a patrolman, who he's picked
up; and the three of 'em nab our stylish friend in the act of
pawning this ring."</p>

<p>He tossed a square solitaire diamond in a filigreed platinum
setting on the district attorney's desk.</p>

<p>"I was at the office when they brought him in, and I sent
Snitkin with the ring up to Harlem to see what the maid had to say
about it, and she identified it as belonging to Odell."</p>

<p>"But, I say, it wasn't a part of the <i>bijouterie</i> the lady
was wearing that night, was it, Sergeant?" Vance put the question
casually.</p>

<p>Heath jerked about and eyed him with sullen calculation.</p>

<p>"What if it wasn't? It came out of that jimmied jewel
case&mdash;or I'm Ben Hur."</p>

<p>"Of course it did," murmured Vance, lapsing into lethargy.</p>

<p>"And that's where we're in luck," declared Heath, turning back
to Markham. "It connects Skeel directly with the murder and the
robbery."</p>

<p>"What has Skeel to say about it?" Markham was leaning forward
intently. "I suppose you questioned him."</p>

<p>"I'll say we did," replied the sergeant; but his tone was
troubled. "We had him up all night giving him the works. And the
story he tells is this: he says the girl gave him the ring a week
ago, and that he didn't see her again until the afternoon of the
day before yesterday. He came to her apartment between four and
five&mdash;you remember the maid said she was out then&mdash;and
entered and left the house by the side door, which was unlocked at
that time. He admits he called again at half past nine that night,
but he says that when he found she was out, he went straight home
and stayed there. His alibi is that he sat up with his landlady
till after midnight playing Khun Khan and drinking beer. I hopped
up to his place this morning, and the old girl verified it. But
that don't mean anything. The house he lives in is a pretty tough
hangout, and this landlady, besides being a heavy boozer, has been
up the river a coupla times for shoplifting."</p>

<p>"What does Skeel say about the fingerprints?"</p>

<p>"He says, of course, he made 'em when he was there in the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"And the one on the closet doorknob?"</p>

<p>Heath gave a derisive grunt.</p>

<p>"He's got an answer for that, too&mdash;says he thought he heard
someone coming in, and locked himself in the clothes closet. Didn't
want to be seen and spoil any game Odell mighta been playing."</p>

<p>"Most considerate of him to keep out of the way of the <i>belles
poires,"</i> drawled Vance. "Touchin' loyalty, what?"</p>

<p>"You don't believe the rat, do you, Mr. Vance?" asked Heath,
with indignant surprise.</p>

<p>"Can't say that I do. But our Antonio at least spins a
consistent yarn."</p>

<p>"Too damn consistent to suit me," growled the sergeant.</p>

<p>"That's all you could get out of him?" It was plain that Markham
was not pleased with the results of Heath's third degree of
Skeel.</p>

<p>"That's about all, sir. He stuck to his story like a leech."</p>

<p>"You found no chisel in his room?"</p>

<p>Heath admitted that he hadn't. "But you couldn't expect him to
keep it around," he added.</p>

<p>Markham pondered the facts for several minutes. "I can't see
that we've got a very good case, however much we may be convinced
of Skeel's guilt. His alibi may be thin, but taken in connection
with the phone operator's testimony, I'm inclined to think it would
hold tight in court."</p>

<p>"What about the ring, sir?" Heath was desperately disappointed.
"And what about his threats, and his fingerprints, and his record
of similar burglaries?"</p>

<p>"Contributory factors only," Markham explained. "What we need
for a murder is more than a <i>prima facie</i> case. A good
criminal lawyer could have him discharged in twenty minutes, even
if I could secure an indictment. It's not impossible, you know,
that the woman gave him the ring a week ago&mdash;you recall that
the maid said he was demanding money from her about that time. And
there's nothing to show that the fingerprints were not actually
made late Monday afternoon. Moreover, we can't connect him in any
way with the chisel, for we don't know who did the Park Avenue job
last summer. His whole story fits the facts perfectly; and we
haven't anything contradictory to offer."</p>

<p>Heath shrugged helplessly; all the wind had been taken out of
his sails.</p>

<p>"What do you want done with him?" he asked desolately.</p>

<p>Markham considered&mdash;he, too, was discomfited.</p>

<p>"Before I answer, I think I'll have a go at him myself."</p>

<p>He pressed a buzzer and ordered a clerk to fill out the
necessary requisition. When it had been signed in duplicate, he
sent Swacker with it to Ben Hanlon.</p>

<p>"Do ask him about those silk shirts," suggested Vance. "And find
out, if you can, if he considers a white waistcoat <i>de
rigueur</i> with a dinner jacket."</p>

<p>"This office isn't a male millinery shop," snapped Markham.</p>

<p>"But, Markham dear, you won't learn anything else from this
Petronius."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later a deputy sheriff from the Tombs entered with
his handcuffed prisoner.</p>

<p>Skeel's appearance that morning belied his sobriquet of "Dude."
He was haggard and pale; his ordeal of the previous night had left
its imprint upon him. He was unshaven; his hair was uncombed; the
ends of his moustache drooped; and his cravat was awry. But despite
his bedraggled condition, his manner was jaunty and contemptuous.
He gave Heath a defiant leer and faced the district attorney with
swaggering indifference.</p>

<p>To Markham's questions he doggedly repeated the same story he
had told Heath. He clung tenaciously to every detail of it with the
ready accuracy of a man who had painstakingly memorized a lesson
and was thoroughly familiar with it. Markham coaxed, threatened,
bullied. All hint of his usual affability was gone; he was like an
inexorable dynamic machine. But Skeel, whose nerves seemed to be
made of iron, withstood the vicious fire of his cross-questioning
without wincing; and, I confess, his resistance somewhat aroused my
admiration despite my revulsion toward him and all he stood
for.</p>

<p>After half an hour Markham gave up, completely baffled in his
efforts to elicit any damaging admissions from the man. He was
about to dismiss him when Vance rose languidly and strolled to the
district attorney's desk. Seating himself on the edge of it, he
regarded Skeel with impersonal curiosity.</p>

<p>"So you're a devotee of Khun Khan, eh?" he remarked
indifferently. "Silly game, what? More interestin' than Conquain or
Rum, though. Used to be played in the London clubs. Of East Indian
origin, I believe...You still play it with two decks, I suppose,
and permit round-the-corner mating?"</p>

<p>An involuntary frown gathered on Skeel's forehead. He was used
to violent district attorneys and familiar with the bludgeoning
methods of the police, but here was a type of inquisitor entirely
new to him; and it was plain that he was both puzzled and
apprehensive. He decided to meet this novel antagonist with a smirk
of arrogant amusement.</p>

<p>"By the bye," continued Vance, with no change in tone, "can
anyone hidden in the clothes press of the Odell living room see the
davenport through the keyhole?"</p>

<p>Suddenly all trace of a smile was erased from the man's
features.</p>

<p>"And I say," Vance hurried on, his eyes fixed steadily on the
other, "why didn't you give the alarm?"</p>

<p>I was watching Skeel closely, and though his set expression did
not alter, I saw the pupils of his eyes dilate. Markham, also, I
think, noted this phenomenon.</p>

<p>"Don't bother to answer," pursued Vance, as the man opened his
lips to speak. "But tell me: didn't the sight shake you up a
bit?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Skeel retorted with
sullen impertinence. But, for all his sangfroid, one sensed an
uneasiness in his manner. There was an overtone of effort in his
desire to appear indifferent, which robbed his words of complete
conviction.</p>

<p>"Not a pleasant situation, that." Vance ignored his retort. "How
did you feel, crouching there in the dark, when the closet doorknob
was turned and someone tried to get in?" His eyes were boring into
the man, though his voice retained its casual intonation.</p>

<p>The muscles of Skeel's face tightened, but he did not speak.</p>

<p>"Lucky thing you took the precaution of locking yourself
in&mdash;eh, what?" Vance went on. "Suppose he'd got the door
open&mdash;my word! Then what?..."</p>

<p>He paused and smiled with a kind of silky sweetness which was
more impressive than any glowering aggression.</p>

<p>"I say, did you have your steel chisel ready for him? Maybe he'd
have been too quick and strong for you&mdash;maybe there would have
been thumbs pressing against your larnyx, too, before you could
have struck him&mdash;eh?...Did you think of that, there in the
dark?...No, not precisely a pleasant situation. A bit gruesome, in
fact."</p>

<p>"What are you raving about?" Skeel spat out insolently. "You're
balmy." But his swagger had been forgotten, and a look akin to
horror had passed across his face. This slackening of pose was
momentary, however; almost at once his smirk returned, and his head
swayed in contempt.</p>

<p>Vance sauntered back to his chair and stretched himself in it
listlessly, as if all his interest in the case had again
evaporated.</p>

<p>Markham had watched the little drama attentively, but Heath had
sat smoking with ill-concealed annoyance. The silence that followed
was broken by Skeel.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I'm to be railroaded. Got it all planned, have
you?...Try and railroad me!" He laughed harshly. "My lawyer's Abe
Rubin, and you might phone him that I'd like to see him."*</p>

<p>* Abe Rubin was at that time the most resourceful and
unscrupulous criminal lawyer in New York. Since his disbarment two
years ago, little has been heard from him.</p>

<p>Markham, with a gesture of annoyance, waved to the deputy
sheriff to take Skeel back to the Tombs.</p>

<p>"What were you trying to get at?" he asked Vance when the man
was gone.</p>

<p>"Just an elusive notion in the depths of my being struggling for
the light." Vance smoked placidly a moment. "I thought Mr. Skeel
might be persuaded to pour out his heart to us. So I wooed him with
words."</p>

<p>"That's just bully," gibed Heath. "I was expecting you any
minute to ask him if he played mumbly-peg or if his grandmother was
a hootowl."</p>

<p>"Sergeant, dear Sergeant," pleaded Vance, "don't be unkind. I
simply couldn't endure it...And really, now, didn't my chat with
Mr. Skeel suggest a possibility to you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Heath, "that he was hiding in the closet when Odell
was killed. But where does that get us? It lets Skeel out, although
the job was a professional one, and he was caught red-handed with
some of the swag."</p>

<p>He turned disgustedly to the district attorney.</p>

<p>"And now what, sir?"</p>

<p>"I don't like the look of things," Markham complained. "If Skeel
has Abe Rubin to defend him, we won't stand a chance with the case
we've got. I feel convinced he was mixed up in it; but no judge
will accept my personal feelings as evidence."</p>

<p>"We could turn the Dude loose and have him tailed," suggested
Heath grudgingly. "We might catch him doing something that'll give
the game away."</p>

<p>Markham considered.</p>

<p>"That might be a good plan," he acceded. "We'll certainly get no
more evidence on him as long as he's locked up."</p>

<p>"It looks like our only chance, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well," agreed Markham. "Let him think we're through with
him; he may get careless. I'll leave the whole thing to you,
Sergeant. Keep a couple of good men on him day and night. Something
may happen."</p>

<p>Heath rose, an unhappy man. "Right, sir. I'll attend to it."</p>

<p>"And I'd like to have more data on Charles Cleaver," added
Markham. "Find out what you can of his relations with the Odell
girl. Also, get me a line on Doctor Ambroise Lindquist. What's his
history? What are his habits? You know the kind of thing. He
treated the girl for some mysterious or imaginary ailment; and I
think he has something up his sleeve. But don't go near him
personally&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>Heath jotted the name down in his notebook, without
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"And before you set your stylish captive free," put in Vance,
yawning, "you might, don't y' know, see if he carries a key that
fits the Odell apartment."</p>

<p>Heath jerked up short and grinned. "Now, that idea's got some
sense to it...Funny I didn't think of it myself." And, shaking
hands with all of us, he went out.</p>

<h2>13 - AN ERSTWHILE GALLANT</h2>

<p><i>(Wednesday, September 12; 10:30 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Swacker was evidently waiting for an opportunity to interrupt,
for, when Sergeant Heath had passed through the door, he at once
stepped into the room.</p>

<p>"The reporters are here, sir," he announced, with a wry face.
"You said you'd see them at ten thirty."</p>

<p>In response to a nod from his chief, he held open the door, and
a dozen or more newspaper men came trooping in.</p>

<p>"No questions, please, this morning," Markham begged pleasantly.
"It's too early in the game. But I'll tell you all I know...I agree
with Sergeant Heath that the Odell murder was the work of a
professional criminal&mdash;the same who broke into Arnheim's house
on Park Avenue last summer."</p>

<p>Briefly he told of Inspector Brenner's findings in connection
with the chisel. "We've made no arrest, but one may be expected in
the very near future. In fact, the police have the case well in
hand but are going carefully in order to avoid any chance of an
acquittal. We've already recovered some of the missing
jewelry..."</p>

<p>He talked to the reporters for five minutes or so, but he made
no mention of the testimony of the maid or the phone operators, and
carefully avoided the mention of any names.</p>

<p>When we were again alone, Vance chuckled admiringly.</p>

<p>"A masterly evasion, my dear Markham! Legal training has its
advantages&mdash;decidedly it has its advantages...'We've recovered
some of the missing jewelry!' Sweet winged words! Not an
untruth&mdash;oh, no!&mdash;but how deceivin'! Really, y' know, I
must devote more time to the caressin' art of <i>suggestio
falsi</i> and <i>suppressio veri.</i> You should be crowned with an
anadem of myrtle."</p>

<p>"Leaving all that to one side," Markham rejoined impatiently,
"suppose you tell me, now that Heath's gone, what was in your mind
when you applied your verbal voodooism to Skeel. What was all the
conjurer-talk about dark closets, and alarums, and pressing thumbs,
and peering through keyholes?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, I didn't think my little chit-chat was so cryptic,"
answered Vance. "The <i>recherch&eacute;</i> Tony was undoubtedly
ambuscaded <i>&agrave; la sourdine</i> in the clothes press at some
time during the fatal evening; and I was merely striving, in my
amateurish way, to ascertain the exact hour of his
concealment."</p>

<p>"And did you?"</p>

<p>"Not conclusively." Vance shook his head sadly. "Y' know,
Markham, I'm the proud possessor of a theory&mdash;it's vague and
obscure and unsubtantial; and it's downright unintelligible. And
even if it were verified, I can't see how it would help us any, for
it would leave the situation even more incomprehensible than it
already is...I almost wish I hadn't questioned Heath's Beau Nash.
He upset my ideas frightfully."</p>

<p>"From what I could gather, you seem to think it possible that
Skeel witnessed the murder. That couldn't, by any stretch of the
imagination, be your precious theory?"</p>

<p>"That's part of it, anyway."</p>

<p>"My dear Vance, you do astonish me!" Markham laughed outright.
"Skeel, then, according to you, is innocent; but he keeps his
knowledge to himself, invents an alibi, and doesn't even tattle
when he's arrested...It won't hold water."</p>

<p>"I know," sighed Vance. "It's a veritable sieve. And yet, the
notion haunts me&mdash;it rides me like a hag&mdash;it eats into my
vitals."</p>

<p>"Do you realize that this mad theory of yours presupposes that,
when Spotswoode and Miss Odell returned from the theater, there
were <i>two</i> men hidden in the apartment&mdash;two men
<i>unknown to each other</i>&mdash;namely Skeel and your
hypothetical murderer?"</p>

<p>"Of course I realize it; and the thought of it is breaking down
my reason."</p>

<p>"Furthermore, they must have entered the apartment separately
and hidden separately...How, may I ask, did they get in? And how
did they get out? And which one caused the girl to scream after
Spotswoode had left? And what was the other one doing in the
meantime? And if Skeel was a passive spectator, horrified and mute,
how do you account for his breaking open the jewel case and
securing the ring&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop! Don't torture me so," Vance pleaded. "I know I'm
insane. Been given to hallucinations since birth;
but&mdash;Merciful Heaven!&mdash;I've never before had one as crazy
as this."</p>

<p>"On that point at least, my dear Vance, we are in complete and
harmonious agreement," smiled Markham.</p>

<p>Just then Swacker came in and handed Markham a letter.</p>

<p>"Brought by messenger, and marked 'immediate,'" he
explained.</p>

<p>The letter, written on heavy engraved stationery, was from
Doctor Lindquist, and explained that between the hours of 11 P.M.
and 1 A.M. on Monday night he had been in attendance on a patient
at his sanitarium. It also apologized for his actions when asked
regarding his whereabouts, and offered a wordy, but not
particularly convincing, explanation of his conduct. He had had an
unusually trying day, it seemed&mdash;neurotic cases were trying,
at best&mdash;and the suddenness of our visit, together with the
apparently hostile nature of Markham's questions, had completely
upset him. He was more than sorry for his outburst, he said, and
stood ready to assist in any way he could. It was unfortunate for
all concerned, he added, that he had lost his temper, for it would
have been a simple matter for him to explain about Monday
night.</p>

<p>"He has thought the situation over calmly," said Vance, "and
hereby offers you a neat little alibi which, I think, you will have
difficulty in shaking...An artful beggar&mdash;like all these
unbalanced pseudopsychiatrists. Observe: he was with a patient. To
be sure! What patient? Why, one too ill to be questioned...There
you are. A cul-de-sac masquerading as an alibi. Not bad, what?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't interest me overmuch." Markham put the letter away.
"That pompous professional ass could never have got into the Odell
apartment without having been seen; and I can't picture him
sneaking in by devious means." He reached for some papers..."And
now, if you don't object, I'll make an effort to earn my $15,000
salary."</p>

<p>But Vance, instead of making a move to go, sauntered to the
table and opened a telephone directory.</p>

<p>"Permit me a suggestion, Markham," he said, after a moment's
search. "Put off your daily grind for a bit, and let's hold polite
converse with Mr. Louis Mannix. Y' know, he's the only presumptive
swain of the inconstant Margaret, so far mentioned, who hasn't been
given an audience. I hanker to gaze upon him and hearken to his
rune. He'd make the family circle complete, so to speak...He still
holds forth in Maiden Lane, I see; and it wouldn't take long to
fetch him here."</p>

<p>Markham had swung half round in his chair at the mention of
Mannix's name. He started to protest, but he knew from experience
that Vance's suggestions were not the results of idle whims; and he
was silent for several moments weighing the matter. With
practically every other avenue of inquiry closed for the moment, I
think the idea of questioning Mannix rather appealed to him.</p>

<p>"All right," he consented, ringing for Swacker; "though I don't
see how he can help. According to Heath, the Odell girl gave him
his <i>cong&eacute;</i> a year ago."</p>

<p>"He may still have hay on his horns, or, like Hotspur, be drunk
with choler. You can't tell." Vance resumed his chair. "With such a
name, he'd bear investigation <i>ipso facto."</i></p>

<p>Markham sent Swacker for Tracy; and when the latter arrived,
suave and beaming, he was given instructions to take the district
attorney's car and bring Mannix to the office.</p>

<p>"Get a subpoena," said Markham; "and use it if necessary."</p>

<p>Half an hour or so later Tracy returned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mannix made no difficulty about coming," he reported. "Was
quite agreeable, in fact. He's in the waiting room now."</p>

<p>Tracy was dismissed, and Mannix was ushered in.</p>

<p>He was a large man, and he walked with the forced elasticity of
gait which epitomizes the silent struggle of incipiently corpulent
middle age to deny the onrush of the years and cling to the
semblance of youth. He carried a slender wanghee cane; and his
checkered suit, brocaded waistcoat, pearl-gray gaiters, and gaily
beribboned Homburg hat gave him an almost foppish appearance. But
these various indications of sportiveness were at once forgotten
when one inspected his features. His small eyes were bright and
crafty; his nose was bibative, and appeared disproportionately
small above his thick, sensual lips and prognathous jaw. There was
an oiliness and shrewdness in the man's manner which were at once
repulsive and arresting.</p>

<p>At a gesture from Markham he sat down on the edge of a chair,
placing a podgy hand on each knee. His attitude was one of alert
suspicion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mannix," said Markham, an engaging note of apology in his
voice, "I am sorry to have discommoded you; but the matter in hand
is both serious and urgent...A Miss Margaret Odell was murdered
night before last, and in the course of inquiries we learned that
you had at one time known her quite well. It occurred to me that
you might be in possession of some facts about her that would
assist us in our investigation."</p>

<p>A saponaceous smile, meant to be genial, parted the man's heavy
lips.</p>

<p>"Sure, I knew the Canary&mdash;a long time ago, y' understand."
He permitted himself a sigh. "A fine, high-class girl, if I do say
so. A good looker and a good dresser. Too damn bad she didn't go on
with the show business. But"&mdash;he made a repudiative motion
with his hand&mdash;"I haven't seen the lady, y' understand, for
over a year&mdash;not to speak to, if you know what I mean."</p>

<p>Mannix clearly was on his guard, and his beady little eyes did
not once leave the district attorney's face.</p>

<p>"You had a quarrel with her perhaps?" Markham asked the question
incuriously.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I wouldn't go so far as to say we quarreled. No."
Mannix paused, seeking the correct word. "You might say we
disagreed&mdash;got tired of the arrangement and decided to
separate; kind of drifted apart. Last thing I told her was, if she
ever needed a friend, she'd know where to find me."</p>

<p>"Very generous of you," murmured Markham. "And you never renewed
your little affair?"</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;never. Don't remember ever speaking to her from
that day to this."</p>

<p>"In view of certain things I've learned, Mr.
Mannix"&mdash;Markham's tone was regretful&mdash;"I must ask you a
somewhat personal question. Did she ever make an attempt to
blackmail you?"</p>

<p>Mannix hesitated, and his eyes seemed to grow even smaller, like
those of a man thinking rapidly.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" he replied, with belated emphasis. "Not at all.
Nothing of the kind." He raised both hands in protest against the
thought. Then he asked furtively: "What gave you such an idea?"</p>

<p>"I have been told," explained Markham, "that she had extorted
money from one or two of her admirers."</p>

<p>Mannix made a wholly unconvincing grimace of astonishment. "Well
well! You don't tell me! Can it be possible?" He peered shrewdly at
the district attorney. "Maybe it was Charlie Cleaver she
blackmailed&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>Markham picked him up quickly.</p>

<p>"Why do you say Cleaver?"</p>

<p>Again Mannix waved his thick hand, this time deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"No special reason, y' understand. Just thought it might be
him...No special reason."</p>

<p>"Did Cleaver ever tell you he'd been blackmailed?"</p>

<p>"Cleaver tell me?...Now, I ask you, Mr. Markham: why should
Cleaver tell me such a story&mdash;why should he?"</p>

<p>"And you never told Cleaver that the Odell girl had blackmailed
you?"</p>

<p>"Positively not!" Mannix gave a scornful laugh which was far too
theatrical to have been genuine. "Me tell Cleaver I'd been
blackmailed? Now, that's funny, that is."</p>

<p>"Then, why did you mention Cleaver a moment ago?"</p>

<p>"No reason at all&mdash;like I told you...He knew the Canary;
but that ain't no secret."</p>

<p>Markham dropped the subject. "What do you know about Miss
Odell's relations with a Doctor Ambroise Lindquist?"</p>

<p>Mannix was now obviously perplexed. "Never heard of
him&mdash;no, never. She didn't know him when I was taking her
around."</p>

<p>"Whom else besides Cleaver did she know well?"</p>

<p>Mannix shook his head ponderously.</p>

<p>"Now, that I couldn't say&mdash;positively I couldn't say. Seen
her with this man and that, same as everybody saw her; but who they
were I don't know&mdash;absolutely."</p>

<p>"Ever hear of Tony Skeel?" Markham quickly leaned over and met
the other's gaze inquiringly.</p>

<p>Once more Mannix hesitated, and his eyes glittered
calculatingly. "Well, now that you ask me, I believe I did hear of
the fellow. But I couldn't swear to it, y' understand...What makes
you think I heard of this Skeel fellow?"</p>

<p>Markham ignored the question.</p>

<p>"Can you think of no one who might have borne Miss Odell a
grudge, or had cause to fear her?"</p>

<p>Mannix was volubly emphatic on the subject of his complete
ignorance of any such person; and after a few more questions, which
elicited only denials, Markham let him go.</p>

<p>"Not bad at all, Markham old thing&mdash;eh, what?" Vance seemed
pleased with the conference. "Wonder why he's so coy? Not a nice
person, this Mannix. And he's so fearful lest he be informative.
Again, I wonder why. He was so careful&mdash;oh, so careful."</p>

<p>"He was sufficiently careful, at any rate, not to tell us
anything," declared Markham gloomily.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't say that, don't y' know." Vance lay back and smoked
placidly. "A ray of light filtered through here and there. Our
fur-importing philogynist denied he'd been blackmailed&mdash;which
was obviously untrue&mdash;and tried to make us believe that he and
the lovely Margaret cooed like turtledoves at
parting&mdash;Tosh!...And then, that mention of Cleaver. That
wasn't spontaneous&mdash;dear me, no. Brother Mannix and
spontaneity are as the poles apart. He had a reason for bringing
Cleaver in; and I fancy that if you knew what that reason was,
you'd feel like flinging roses riotously, and that sort of thing.
Why Cleaver? That <i>secret-de-Polichinelle</i> explanation was a
bit weak. The orbits of these two paramours cross somewhere. On
that point, at least, Mannix inadvertently enlightened
us...Moreover, it's plain that he doesn't know our fashionable
healer with the satyr ears. But, on the other hand, he's aware of
the existence of Mr. Skeel, and would rather like to deny the
acquaintance...So&mdash;<i>voil&agrave; l'affaire.</i> Plenty of
information; but&mdash;my word!&mdash;what to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I give it up," acknowledged Markham hopelessly.</p>

<p>"I know; it's a sad sad world," Vance commiserated him. "But you
must face the olla podrida with a bright eye. It's time for lunch,
and a fillet of sole <i>Margu&eacute;ry</i> will cheer you no
end."</p>

<p>Markham glanced at the clock and permitted himself to be led to
the Lawyers Club.</p>

<h2>14 - VANCE OUTLINES A THEORY</h2>

<p><i>(Wednesday, September 12; evening)</i>
</p>

<p>Vance and I did not return to the district attorney's office
after lunch, for Markham had a busy afternoon before him, and
nothing further was likely to transpire in connection with the
Odell case until Sergeant Heath had completed his investigations of
Cleaver and Doctor Lindquist. Vance had seats for Giordano's
<i>Madame Sans-G&ecirc;ne,</i> and two o'clock found us at the
Metropolitan. Though the performance was excellent, Vance was too
<i>distrait</i> to enjoy it; and it was significant that, after the
opera, he directed the chauffeur to the Stuyvesant Club. I knew he
had a tea appointment, and that he had planned to motor to Longue
Vue for dinner; and the fact that he should have dismissed these
social engagements from his mind in order to be with Markham showed
how intensely the problem of the murder had absorbed his
interest.</p>

<p>It was after six o'clock when Markham came in, looking harassed
and tired. No mention of the case was made during dinner, with the
exception of Markham's casual remark that Heath had turned in his
reports on Cleaver and doctor Lindquist and Mannix. (It seemed
that, immediately after lunch, he had telephoned to the sergeant to
add Mannix's name to the two others as a subject for inquiry.) It
was not until we had retired to our favorite corner of the lounge
room that the topic of the murder was brought up for
discussion.</p>

<p>And that discussion, brief and one-sided, was the beginning of
an entirely new line of investigation&mdash;a line which, in the
end, led to the guilty person.</p>

<p>Markham sank wearily into his chair. He had begun to show the
strain of the last two days of fruitless worry. His eyes were a
trifle heavy, and there was a grim tenacity in the lines of his
mouth. Slowly and deliberately he lighted a cigar, and took several
deep inhalations.</p>

<p>"Damn the newspapers!" he grumbled. "Why can't they let the
district attorney's office handle its business in its own
way?...Have you seen the afternoon papers? They're all clamoring
for the murderer. You'd think I had him up my sleeve."</p>

<p>"You forget, my dear chap," grinned Vance, "that we are living
under the benign and upliftin' reign of Democritus, which confers
upon every ignoramus the privilege of promiscuously criticising his
betters."</p>

<p>Markham snorted. "I don't complain about criticism; it's the
lurid imagination of these bright young reporters that galls me.
They're trying to turn this sordid crime into a spectacular Borgia
melodrama, with passion running rampant, and mysterious influences
at work, and all the pomp and trappings of a medieval
romance...You'd think even a schoolboy could see that it was only
an ordinary robbery and murder of the kind that's taking place
regularly throughout the country."</p>

<p>Vance paused in the act of lighting a cigarette, and his
eyebrows lifted. Turning, he regarded Markham with a look of mild
incredulity. "I say! Do you really mean to tell me that your
statement for the press was given out in good faith?"</p>

<p>Markham looked up in surprise. "Certainly it was...What do you
mean by 'good faith'?"</p>

<p>Vance smiled indolently. "I rather thought, don't y' know, that
your oration to the reporters was a bit of strategy to lull the
real culprit into a state of false security, and to give you a
clear field for investigation."</p>

<p>Markham contemplated him a moment.</p>

<p>"See here, Vance," he demanded irritably, "what are you driving
at?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all&mdash;really, old fellow," the other assured him
affably. "I knew that Heath was deadly sincere about his belief in
Skeel's guilt, but it never occurred to me, d' ye see, that you
yourself actually regarded the crime as one committed by a
professional burglar. I foolishly thought that you let Skeel go
this morning in the hope that he would lead you somehow to the
guilty person. I rather imagined you were spoofing the trusting
sergeant by pretending to fall in with his silly notion."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see! Still clinging to your weird theory that a brace of
villains were present, hiding in separate clothes closets, or
something of the kind." Markham made no attempt to temper his
sarcasm. "A sapient idea&mdash;so much more intelligent that
Heath's!"</p>

<p>"I know it's weird. But it happens not to be any weirder than
your theory of a lone yeggman."</p>

<p>"And for what reason, pray," persisted Markham, with
considerable warmth, "do you consider the yeggman theory
weird?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reason that it was not the crime of a
professional thief at all, but the willfully deceptive act of a
particularly clever man who doubtless spent weeks in its
preparation."</p>

<p>Markham sank back in his chair and laughed heartily. "Vance, you
have contributed the one ray of sunshine to an otherwise gloomy and
depressing case."</p>

<p>Vance bowed with mock humility.</p>

<p>"It gives me great pleasure," was his dulcet rejoinder, "to be
able to bring even a wisp of light into so clouded a mental
atmosphere."</p>

<p>A brief silence followed. Then Markham asked, "Is this
fascinating and picturesque conclusion of yours regarding the
highly intellectual character of the Odell woman's murderer based
on your new and original psychological methods of deduction?" There
was no mistaking the ridicule in his voice.</p>

<p>"I arrived at it," explained Vance sweetly, "by the same process
of logic I used in determining the guilt of Alvin Benson's
murderer."</p>

<p>Markham smiled. <i>"Touch&eacute;!...</i> Don't think I'm so
ungrateful as to belittle the work you did in that case. But this
time, I fear, you've permitted your theories to lead you hopelessly
astray. The present case is what the police call an open-and-shut
affair."</p>

<p>"Particularly shut," amended Vance dryly. "And both you and the
police are in the distressin' situation of waiting inactively for
your suspected victim to give the game away."</p>

<p>"I'll admit the situation is not all one could desire." Markham
spoke morosely. "But even so, I can't see that there's any
opportunity in this affair for your recondite psychological
methods. The thing's too obvious&mdash;that's the trouble. What we
need now is evidence, not theories. If it wasn't for the spacious
and romantic imaginings of the newspaper men, public interest in
the case would already have died out."</p>

<p>"Markham," said Vance quietly, but with unwonted seriousness,
"if that's what you really believe, then you may as well drop the
case now; for you're foredoomed to failure. You think it's an
obvious crime. But let me tell you, it's a subtle crime, if ever
there was one. And it's as clever as it is subtle. No common
criminal committed it&mdash;believe me. It was done by a man of
very superior intellect and astoundin' ingenuity."</p>

<p>Vance's assured, matter-of-fact tone had a curiously convincing
quality; and Markham, restraining his impulse to scoff, assumed an
air of indulgent irony.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "by what cryptic mental process you arrived
at so fantastic a conclusion."</p>

<p>"With pleasure." Vance took a few puffs on his cigarette and
lazily watched the smoke curl upward.*</p>

<p>* I sent a proof of the following paragraphs to Vance, and he
edited and corrected them; so that, as they now stand, they
represent his theories in practically his own words.</p>

<p>"Y' know, Markham," he began, in his emotionless drawl, "every
genuine work of art has a quality which the critics call
<i>&eacute;lan</i>&mdash;namely, enthusiasm and spontaneity. A
copy, or imitation, lacks that distinguishing characteristic; it's
too perfect, too carefully done, too exact. Even enlightened scions
of the law, I fancy, are aware that there is bad drawing in
Botticelli and disproportions in Rubens, what? In an original, d'
ye see, such flaws don't matter. But an imitator never puts 'em in:
he doesn't dare&mdash;he's too intent on getting all the details
correct. The imitator works with a self-consciousness and a
meticulous care which the artist, in the throes of creative labor,
never exhibits. And here's the point: there's no way of imitating
that enthusiasm and spontaneity&mdash;that
<i>&eacute;lan</i>&mdash;which an original painting possesses.
However closely a copy may resemble an original, there's a vast
psychological difference between them. The copy breathes an air of
insincerity, of ultra-perfection, of conscious effort...You follow
me, eh?"</p>

<p>"Most instructive, my dear Ruskin."</p>

<p>Vance meekly bowed his appreciation, and proceeded pleasantly.
"Now, let us consider the Odell murder. You and Heath are agreed
that it is a commonplace, brutal, sordid, unimaginative crime. But,
unlike you two bloodhounds on the trail, I have ignored its mere
appearances and have analyzed its various factors&mdash;I have
looked at it psychologically, so to speak. And I have discovered
that it is not a genuine and sincere crime&mdash;that is to say, an
original&mdash;but only a sophisticated, self-conscious and clever
imitation, done by a skilled copyist. I grant you it is correct and
typical in every detail. But just there is where it fails, don't y'
know. Its technic is too good, its craftsmanship too perfect. The
ensemble, as it were, is not convincing&mdash;it lacks
<i>&eacute;lan.</i> Aesthetically speaking, it has all the earmarks
of a <i>tour de force.</i> Vulgarly speaking, it's a fake." He
paused and gave Markham an engaging smile. "I trust this somewhat
oracular peroration has not bored you."</p>

<p>"Pray continue," urged Markham, with exaggerated politeness. His
manner was jocular, but something in his tone led me to believe
that he was seriously interested.</p>

<p>"What is true of art is true of life," Vance resumed placidly.
"Every human action, d' ye see, conveys unconsciously an impression
either of genuineness or of spuriousness&mdash;of sincerity or
calculation. For example, two men at table eat in a similar way,
handle their knives and forks in the same fashion, and apparently
do the identical things. Although the sensitive spectator cannot
put his finger on the points of difference, he nonetheless senses
at once which man's breeding is genuine and instinctive and which
man's is imitative and self-conscious."</p>

<p>He blew a wreath of smoke toward the ceiling and settled more
deeply into his chair.</p>

<p>"Now, Markham, just what are the universally recognized features
of a sordid crime of robbery and murder?...Brutality, disorder,
haste, ransacked drawers, cluttered desks, broken jewel cases,
rings stripped from the victim's fingers, severed pendant chains,
torn clothing, tipped-over chairs, upset lamps, broken vases,
twisted draperies, strewn floors, and so forth. Such are the
accepted immemorial indications&mdash;eh, what? But&mdash;consider
a moment, old chap. Outside of fiction and the drama, in how many
crimes do they <i>all</i> appear&mdash;all in perfect ordination,
and without a single element to contradict the general effect? That
is to say, how many actual crimes are technically perfect in their
settings?...None! And why? Simply because nothing actual in this
life&mdash;nothing that is spontaneous and genuine&mdash;runs to
accepted form in every detail. The law of chance and fallibility
invariably steps in."</p>

<p>He made a slight indicative gesture.</p>

<p>"But regard this particular crime: look at it closely. What do
you find? You will perceive that its <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i>
has been staged, and its drama enacted, down to every minute
detail&mdash;like a Zola novel. It is almost mathematically
perfect. And therein, d' ye see, lies the irresistible inference of
its having been carefully premeditated and planned. To use an art
term, it is a tickled-up crime. Therefore, its conception was not
spontaneous...And yet, don't y' know, I can't point out any
specific flaw; for its great flaw lies in its being flawless. And
nothing flawless, my dear fellow, is natural or genuine."</p>

<p>Markham was silent for a while.</p>

<p>"You deny even the remote possibility of a common thief having
murdered the girl?" he asked at length; and now there was no hint
of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p>"If a common thief did it," contended Vance, "then there's no
science of psychology, there are no philosophic truths, and there
are no laws of art. If it was a genuine crime of robbery, then, by
the same token, there is no difference whatever between an old
master and a clever technician's copy."</p>

<p>"You'd entirely eliminate robbery as the motive, I take it."</p>

<p>"The robbery," Vance affirmed, "was only a manufactured detail.
The fact that the crime was committed by a highly astute person
indicates unquestionably that there was a far more potent motive
behind it. Any man capable of so ingenious and clever a piece of
deception is obviously a person of education and imagination; and
he most certainly would not have run the stupendous risk of killing
a woman unless he had feared some overwhelming
disaster&mdash;unless, indeed, her continuing to live would have
caused him greater mental anguish, and would have put him in
greater jeopardy, even than the crime itself. Between two colossal
dangers, he chose the murder as the lesser."</p>

<p>Markham did not speak at once; he seemed lost in reflection. But
presently he turned and, fixing Vance with a dubious stare, said,
"What about that chiselled jewel box? A professional burglar's
jimmy wielded by an experienced hand doesn't fit into your
aesthetic hypothesis&mdash;it is, in fact, diametrically opposed to
such a theory."</p>

<p>"I know it only too well." Vance nodded slowly. "And I've been
harried and hectored by that steel chisel ever since I beheld the
evidence of its work that first morning...Markham, that chisel is
the one genuine note in an otherwise spurious performance. It's as
if the real artist had come along at the moment the copyist had
finished his faked picture, and painted in a single small object
with the hand of a master."</p>

<p>"But doesn't that bring us back inevitably to Skeel?"</p>

<p>"Skeel&mdash;ah, yes. That's the explanation, no doubt; but not
the way you conceive it. Skeel ripped the box open&mdash;I don't
question that; but&mdash;deuce take it!&mdash;it's the only thing
he did do; it's the only thing that was left for him to do. That's
why he got only a ring which La Belle Marguerite was not wearing
that night. All her other baubles&mdash;to wit, those that adorned
her&mdash;had been stripped from her and were gone."</p>

<p>"Why are you so positive on this point?"</p>

<p>"The poker, man&mdash;the poker!...Don't you see? That
amateurish assault upon the jewel case with a cast iron coal
prodder couldn't have been made <i>after</i> the case had been
prized open&mdash;it would have had to be made
<i>before</i><i>.</i> And that seemingly insane attempt to break
steel with cast iron was part of the stage setting. The real
culprit didn't care if he got the case open or not. He merely
wanted it to look as if he had <i>tried</i> to get it open; so he
used the poker and then left it lying beside the dented box."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean." This point, I think, impressed Markham
more strongly than any other Vance had raised; for the presence of
the poker on the dressing table had not been explained away either
by Heath or Inspector Brenner..."Is that the reason you questioned
Skeel as if he might have been present when your other visitor was
there?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. By the evidence of the jewel case I knew he either was
in the apartment when the bogus crime of robbery was being staged,
or else had come upon the scene when it was over and the stage
director had cleared out...From his reactions to my questions I
rather fancy he was present."</p>

<p>"Hiding in the closet?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That would account for the closet not having been
disturbed. As I see it, it wasn't ransacked, for the simple and
rather grotesque reason that the elegant Skeel was locked within.
How else could that one clothes press have escaped the rifling
activities of the pseudoburglar? He wouldn't have omitted it
deliberately, and he was far too thoroughgoing to have overlooked
it accidentally. Then there are the fingerprints on the
knob..."</p>

<p>Vance lightly tapped on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Markham old dear, you simply must build your
conception of the crime on this hypothesis and proceed accordingly.
If you don't, each edifice you rear will come toppling about your
ears."</p>

<h2>15 - FOUR POSSIBILITIES</h2>

<p><i>(Wednesday, September 12; evening)</i>
</p>

<p>When Vance finished speaking, there was a long silence. Markham,
impressed by the other's earnestness, sat in a brown study. His
ideas had been shaken. The theory of Skeel's guilt, to which he had
clung from the moment of the identification of the fingerprints,
had, it must be admitted, not entirely satisfied him, although he
had been able to suggest no alternative. Now Vance had
categorically repudiated this theory and at the same time had
advanced another which, despite its indefiniteness, had
nevertheless taken into account all the physical points of the
case; and Markham, at first antagonistic, had found himself, almost
against his will, becoming more and more sympathetic to this new
point of view.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Vance!" he said. "I'm not in the least convinced by
your theatrical theory. And yet, I feel a curious undercurrent of
plausibility in your analyses...I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned sharply, and scrutinized the other steadfastly for a
moment.</p>

<p>"Look here! Have you anyone in mind as the protagonist of the
drama you've outlined?"</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, I haven't the slightest notion as to who killed
the lady," Vance assured him. "But if you are ever to find the
murderer, you must look for a shrewd, superior man with nerves of
iron, who was in imminent danger of being irremediably ruined by
the girl&mdash;a man of inherent cruelty and vindictiveness; a
supreme egoist; a fatalist more or less; and, I'm inclined to
believe, something of a madman."</p>

<p>"Mad!"</p>

<p>"Oh, not a lunatic, just a madman, a perfectly normal, logical,
calculating madman&mdash;same as you and I and Van here. Only, our
hobbies are harmless, d' ye see. This chap's mania is outside your
preposterously revered law. That's why you're after him. If his
aberration were stamp collecting or golf, you wouldn't give him a
second thought. But his perfectly rational <i>penchant</i> for
eliminating <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;es</i> ladies who bothered him
fills you with horror; it's not <i>your</i> hobby. Consequently,
you have a hot yearning to flay him alive."</p>

<p>"I'll admit," said Markham coolly, "that a homicidal mania is my
idea of madness."</p>

<p>"But he didn't have a homicidal mania, Markham old thing. You
miss all the fine distinctions in psychology. This man was annoyed
by a certain person, and set to work, masterfully and reasonably,
to do away with the source of his annoyance. And he did it with
surpassin' cleverness. To be sure, his act was a bit grisly. But
when, if ever, you get your hands on him, you'll be amazed to find
how normal he is. And able, too&mdash;oh, able no end."</p>

<p>Again Markham lapsed into a long, thoughtful silence. At last he
spoke.</p>

<p>"The only trouble with your ingenious deductions is that they
don't accord with the known circumstances of the case. And facts,
my dear Vance, are still regarded by a few of us old-fashioned
lawyers as more or less conclusive."</p>

<p>"Why this needless confession of your shortcomings?" inquired
Vance whimsically. Then, after a moment: "Let me have the facts
which appear to you antagonistic to my deductions."</p>

<p>"Well, there are only four men of the type you describe who
could have had any remote reason for murdering the Odell woman.
Heath's scouts went into her history pretty thoroughly, and for
over two years&mdash;that is, since her appearance in the
'Follies'&mdash;the only <i>personae gratae</i> at her apartment
have been Mannix, Doctor Lindquist, Pop Cleaver, and, of course,
Spotswoode. The Canary was a bit exclusive, it seems; and no other
man got near enough to her even to be considered as a possible
murderer."</p>

<p>"It appears, then, that you have a complete quartet to draw on."
Vance's tone was apathetic. "What do you crave&mdash;a
regiment?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Markham patiently. "I crave only one logical
possibility. But Mannix was through with the girl over a year ago;
Cleaver and Spotswoode both have watertight alibis; and that leaves
only Doctor Lindquist, whom I can't exactly picture as a strangler
and meretricious burglar, despite his irascibility. Moreover, he,
too, has an alibi; and it may be a genuine one."</p>

<p>Vance wagged his head. "There's something positively pathetic
about the childlike faith of the legal mind."</p>

<p>"It does cling to rationality at times, doesn't it?" observed
Markham.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!" Vance rebuked him. "The presumption implied in
that remark is most immodest. If you could distinguish between
rationality and irrationality you wouldn't be a lawyer&mdash;you'd
be a god...No; you're going at this thing the wrong way. The real
factors in the case are not what you call the known circumstances,
but the unknown quantities&mdash;the human <i>x</i>'s, so to
speak&mdash;the personalities, or natures, of your quartet."</p>

<p>He lit a fresh cigarette, and lay back, closing his eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you know of these four <i>cavalieri
serventi</i>&mdash;you say Heath has turned in his report. Who were
their mamas? What do they eat for breakfast? Are they susceptible
to poison ivy?...Let's have Spotswoode's dossier first. Do you know
anything about him?"</p>

<p>"In a general way," returned Markham. "Old Puritan stock, I
believe&mdash;governors, burgomasters, a few successful traders.
All Yankee forebears&mdash;no intermixture. As a matter of fact,
Spotswoode represents the oldest and hardiest of the New England
aristocracy&mdash;although I imagine the so-called wine of the
Puritans has become pretty well diluted by now. His affair with the
Odell girl is hardly consonant with the older Puritans'
mortification of the flesh."</p>

<p>"It's wholly consonant, though, with the psychological reactions
which are apt to follow the inhibitions produced by such
mortification," submitted Vance. "But what does he do? Whence
cometh his lucre?"</p>

<p>"His father manufactured automobile accessories, made a fortune
at it, and left the business to him. He tinkers at it, but not
seriously, though I believe he has designed a few
appurtenances."</p>

<p>"I do hope the hideous cut-glass olla for holding paper bouquets
is not one of them. The man who invented that tonneau decoration is
capable of any fiendish crime."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been Spotswoode, then," said Markham
tolerantly, "for he certainly can't qualify as your potential
strangler. We know the girl was alive after he left her, and that,
during the time she was murdered, he was with Judge Redfern...Even
you, friend Vance, couldn't manipulate those facts to the
gentleman's disadvantage."</p>

<p>"On that, at least, we agree," conceded Vance. "And that's all
you know of the gentleman?"</p>

<p>"I think that's all, except that he married a well-to-do
woman&mdash;a daughter of a Southern senator, I believe."</p>

<p>"Doesn't help any...And now, let's have Mannix's history."</p>

<p>Markham referred to a typewritten sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"Both parents immigrants&mdash;came over in the steerage.
Original name Mannikiewicz, or something like that. Born on the
East Side; learned the fur business in his father's retail shop in
Hester Street; worked for the Sanfrasco Cloak Company and got to be
factory foreman. Saved his money and sweetened the pot by
manipulating real estate; then went into the fur business for
himself and steadily worked up to his present opulent state. Public
school and night commercial college. Married in 1900 and divorced a
year later. Lives a gay life&mdash;helps support the nightclubs,
but never gets drunk. I suppose he comes under the head of a
spender and wine opener. Has invested some money in musical
comedies and always has a stage beauty in tow. Runs to
blondes."</p>

<p>"Not very revealin'," sighed Vance. "The city is full of
Mannixes...What did you garner in connection with our bon-ton
medico?"</p>

<p>"The city has its quota of Doctor Lindquists, too, I fear. He
was brought up in a small Middle-West bailiwick&mdash;French and
Magyar extraction; took his M.D. from the Ohio State Medical,
practiced in Chicago&mdash;some shady business there, but never
convicted; came to Albany and got in on the X-ray-machine craze;
invented a breast pump and formed a stock company&mdash;made a
small fortune out of it; went to Vienna for two years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, the Freudian motif!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;returned to New York and opened a private sanitarium;
charged outrageous prices and thereby endeared himself to the
<i>nouveau riche.</i> Has been at the endearing process ever since.
Was defendant in a breach-of-promise suite some years ago, but the
case was settled out of court. He's not married."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't be," commented Vance. "Such gentry never are...
Interestin' summary, though&mdash;yes, decidedly interestin'. I'm
tempted to develop a psychoneurosis and let Ambroise treat me. I do
so want to know him better. And where&mdash;oh, where&mdash;was
this egregious healer at the moment of our erring sister's demise?
Ah, who can tell, my Markham; who knows&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>"In any event, I don't think he was murdering anyone."</p>

<p>"You're so prejudicial!" said Vance. "But let us move
reluctantly on. What's your <i>portrait parl&eacute;</i> of
Cleaver? The fact that he's familiarly called Pop is helpful as a
starter. You simply couldn't imagine Beethoven being called Shorty,
or Bismarck being referred to as Snookums."</p>

<p>"Cleaver has been a politician all of his life&mdash;a Tammany
Hall 'regular.' Was a ward boss at twenty-five; ran a Democratic
club of some kind in Brooklyn for a time; was an alderman for two
terms and practiced general law. Was appointed Tax Commissioner;
left politics and raised a small racing stable. Later secured an
illegal gambling concession at Saratoga; and now operates a
poolroom in Jersey City. He's what you might call a professional
sport. Loves his liquor."</p>

<p>"No marriages?"</p>

<p>"None on the records. But see here: Cleaver's out of it. He was
ticketed in Boonton that night at half past eleven."</p>

<p>"Is that, by any chance, the watertight alibi you mentioned a
moment ago?"</p>

<p>"In any primitive legal way I considered it as such." Markham
resented Vance's question. "The summons was handed him at half past
eleven; it's so marked and dated. And Boonton is fifty miles from
here&mdash;a good two hours' motor ride. Therefore, Cleaver
unquestionably left New York about half past nine; and even if he'd
driven directly back, he couldn't have reached here until long
after the time the medical examiner declared the girl was dead. As
a matter of routine, I investigated the summons and even spoke by
phone to the officer who issued it. It was genuine enough&mdash;I
ought to know: I had it quashed."</p>

<p>"Did this Boonton Dogberry know Cleaver by sight?"</p>

<p>"No, but he gave me an accurate description of him. And
naturally he took the car's number."</p>

<p>Vance looked at Markham with open-eyed sorrow.</p>

<p>"My dear Markham&mdash;my very dear Markham&mdash;can't you see
that all you've actually proved is that a bucolic traffic Nemesis
handed a speed-violation summons to a smooth-faced, middle-aged,
stout man who was driving Cleaver's car near Boonton at half past
eleven on the night of the murder?...And, my word! Isn't that
exactly the sort of alibi the old boy would arrange if he intended
taking the lady's life at midnight or thereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Come, come!" laughed Markham. "That's a bit too far-fetched.
You'd give every lawbreaker credit for concocting schemes of the
most diabolical cunning."</p>

<p>"So I would," admitted Vance apathetically. "And&mdash;d' ye
know?&mdash;rather fancy that's just the kind of schemes a
lawbreaker would concoct, if he was planning a murder, and his own
life was at stake. What really amazes me is the na&iuml;ve
assumption of you investigators that a murderer gives no
intelligent thought whatever to his future safety. It's rather
touchin', y' know."</p>

<p>Markham grunted. "Well, you can take it from me, it was Cleaver
himself who got the summons."</p>

<p>"I dare say you're right," Vance conceded. "I merely suggested
the possibility of deception, don't y' know. The only point I
really insist on is that the fascinatin' Miss Odell was killed by a
man of subtle and superior mentality."</p>

<p>"And I, in turn," irritably rejoined Markham, "insist that the
only men of that type who touched her life intimately enough to
have had any reason to do it are Mannix, Cleaver, Lindquist, and
Spotswoode. And I further insist that not one of them can be
regarded as a promising possibility."</p>

<p>"I fear I must contradict you, old dear," said Vance serenely.
"They're all possibilities&mdash;and one of them is guilty."</p>

<p>Markham glared at him derisively.</p>

<p>"Well, well! So the case is settled! Now, if you'll but indicate
which is the guilty one, I'll arrest him at once and return to my
other duties."</p>

<p>"You're always in such haste," Vance lamented. "Why leap and
run? The wisdom of the world's philosophers is against it.
<i>Festina lente,</i> says Caesar; or, as Rufus has it,
<i>Festinatio tarda est.</i> And the Koran says quite frankly that
haste is of the Devil. Shakespeare was constantly belittling speed:
'He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes'; and, 'Wisely, and
slow; they stumble that run fast.' Then there was
Moli&egrave;re&mdash;remember <i>Sganarelle?&mdash;: 'Le trop de
promptitude &agrave; l'erreur nous expose.'</i> Chaucer also held
similar views. 'He hasteth wel,' said he, 'that wysely can abyde.'
Even God's common people have embalmed the idea in numberless
proverbs: 'Good and quickly seldom meet'; and 'Hasty men never want
woe&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Markham rose with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Hell! I'm going home before you start a bedtime story," he
growled.</p>

<p>The ironical aftermath of this remark was that Vance did tell a
"bedtime story" that night; but he told it to me in the seclusion
of his own library; and the gist of it was this:</p>

<p>"Heath is committed, body and soul, to a belief in Skeel's
guilt; and Markham is as effectively strangled with legal red tape
as the poor Canary was strangled with powerful hands. <i>Eheu,</i>
Van! There's nothing left for me but to set forth tomorrow <i>a
cappella,</i> like Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq, and see what can be
done in the noble cause of justice. I shall ignore both Heath and
Markham, and become as a pelican of the wilderness, an owl of the
desert, a sparrow alone upon the housetop...Really, y' know, I'm no
avenger of society, but I do detest an unsolved problem."</p>

<h2>16 - SIGNIFICANT DISCLOSURES</h2>

<p><i>(Thursday, September 13; forenoon)</i>
</p>

<p>Greatly to Currie's astonishment Vance gave instructions to be
called at nine o'clock the following morning; and at ten o'clock we
were sitting on his little roof garden having breakfast in the
mellow mid-September sunshine.</p>

<p>"Van," he said to me, when Currie had brought us our second cup
of coffee, "however secretive a woman may be, there's always
someone to whom she unburdens her soul. A confidant is an essential
to the feminine temperament. It may be a mother, or a lover, or a
priest, or a doctor, or, more generally, a girl chum. In the
Canary's case we haven't a mother or a priest. Her lover, the
elegant Skeel, was a potential enemy; and we're pretty safe in
ruling out her doctor&mdash;she was too shrewd to confide in such a
creature as Lindquist. The girl chum, then, remains. And today we
seek her." He lit a cigarette and rose. "But, first, we must visit
Mr. Benjamin Browne of Seventh Avenue."</p>

<p>Benjamin Browne was a well-known photographer of stage
celebrities, with galleries in the heart of the city's theatrical
district; and as we entered the reception room of his luxurious
studio later that morning my curiosity as to the object of our
visit was at the breaking point. Vance went straight to the desk,
behind which sat a young woman with flaming red hair and
mascaro-shaded eyes, and bowed in his most dignified manner. Then,
taking a small unmounted photograph from his pocket, he laid it
before her.</p>

<p>"I am producing a musical comedy, mademoiselle," he said, "and I
wish to communicate with the young lady who left this picture of
herself with me. Unfortunately I've misplaced her card; but as her
photograph bore the imprint of Browne's, I thought you might be
good enough to look in your files and tell me who she is and where
I may find her."</p>

<p>He slipped a five-dollar bill under the edge of the blotter, and
waited with an air of innocent expectancy.</p>

<p>The young woman looked at him quizzically, and I thought I
detected the hint of a smile at the corners of her artfully rouged
lips. But after a moment she took the photograph without a word and
disappeared through a rear door. Ten minutes later she returned and
handed Vance the picture. On the back of it she had written a name
and address.</p>

<p>"The young lady is Miss Alys La Fosse, and she lives at the
Belafield Hotel." There was now no doubt as to her smile. "You
really shouldn't be so careless with the addresses of your
applicants&mdash;some poor girl might lose an engagement." And her
smile suddenly turned into soft laughter.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," replied Vance, with mock seriousness, "in the
future I shall be guided by your warning." And with another
dignified bow, he went out.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he said, as we emerged into Seventh Avenue.
"Really, y' know, I should have disguised myself as an impresario,
with a gold-headed cane, a derby, and a purple shirt. That young
woman is thoroughly convinced that I'm contemplating an
intrigue...A jolly smart <i>t&ecirc;te-rouge,</i> that."</p>

<p>He turned into a florist's shop at the corner, and selecting a
dozen American Beauties, addressed them to "Benjamin Browne's
Receptionist."</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "let us stroll to the Belafield, and seek an
audience with Alys."</p>

<p>As we walked across town Vance explained.</p>

<p>"That first morning, when we were inspecting the Canary's rooms,
I was convinced that the murder would never be solved by the usual
elephantine police methods. It was a subtle and well-planned crime,
despite its obvious appearances. No routine investigation would
suffice. Intimate information was needed. Therefore, when I saw
this photograph of the xanthous Alys half hidden under the litter
of papers on the escritoire, I reflected: 'Ah! A girl friend of the
departed Margaret's. She may know just the things that are needed.'
So, when the Sergeant's broad back was turned, I put the picture in
my pocket. There was no other photograph about the place, and this
one bore the usual sentimental inscription. 'Ever thine,' and was
signed 'Alys.' I concluded, therefore, that Alys had played
Anactoria to the Canary's Sappho. Of course I erased the
inscription before presenting the picture to the penetrating sibyl
at Browne's...And here we are at the Belafield, hopin' for a bit of
enlightenment."</p>

<p>The Belafield was a small, expensive apartment-hotel in the East
Thirties, which, to judge from the guests to be seen in the
Americanized Queen Anne lobby, catered to the well-off sporting
set. Vance sent his card up to Miss La Fosse, and received the
message that she would see him in a few minutes. The few minutes,
however, developed into three-quarters of an hour, and it was
nearly noon when a resplendent bellboy came to escort us to the
lady's apartment.</p>

<p>Nature had endowed Miss La Fosse with many of its arts, and
those that Nature had omitted, Miss La Fosse herself had supplied.
She was slender and blond. Her large blue eyes were heavily lashed,
but though she looked at one with a wide-eyed stare, she was unable
to disguise their sophistication. Her toilet had been made with
elaborate care; and as I looked at her, I could not help thinking
what an excellent model she would have been for Ch&eacute;ret's
pastel posters.</p>

<p>"So you are Mr. Vance," she cooed. "I've often seen your name in
<i>Town Topics."</i></p>

<p>Vance gave a shudder.</p>

<p>"And this is Mr. Van Dine," he said sweetly, "&mdash;a mere
attorney, who, thus far, has been denied the pages of that
fashionable weekly."</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" (I am sure Miss La Fosse had spoken the
line in a play; she made of the invitation an impressive
ceremonial.) "I really don't know why I should have received you.
But I suppose you called on business. Perhaps you wish me to appear
at a society bazaar, or something of the kind. But I'm so busy, Mr.
Vance. You simply can't imagine how occupied I am with my work...I
just love my work," she added, with an ecstatic sigh.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure there are many thousands of others who love it,
too," returned Vance, in his best drawing-room manner. "But
unfortunately I have no bazaar to be graced by your charming
presence. I have come on a much more serious matter...You were a
very close friend of Miss Margaret Odell's&mdash;"</p>

<p>The mention of the Canary's name brought Miss La Fosse suddenly
to her feet. Her ingratiating air of affected elegance had quickly
disappeared. Her eyes flashed, and their lids drooped harshly. A
sneer distorted the lines of her cupid's-bow mouth, and she tossed
her head angrily.</p>

<p>"Say, listen! Who do you think you are? I don't know nothing,
and I got nothing to say. So run along&mdash;you and your
lawyer."</p>

<p>But Vance made no move to obey. He took out his cigarette case
and carefully selected a R&eacute;gie.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I smoke? And won't you have one? I import them
direct from my agent in Constantinople. They're exquisitely
blended."</p>

<p>The girl snorted, and gave him a look of cold disdain. The
doll-baby had become a virago.</p>

<p>"Get yourself outa my apartment, or I'll call the house
detective." She turned to the telephone on the wall at her
side.</p>

<p>Vance waited until she had lifted the receiver.</p>

<p>"If you do that, Miss La Fosse, I'll order you taken to the
district attorney's office for questioning," he told her
indifferently, lighting his cigarette and leaning back in his
chair.</p>

<p>Slowly she replaced the receiver and turned. "What's your game,
anyway?...Suppose I did know Margy&mdash;then what? And where do
you fit into the picture?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I don't fit in at all." Vance smiled pleasantly. "But,
for that matter, nobody seems to fit in. The truth is, they're
about to arrest a poor blighter for killing your friend, who wasn't
in the tableau, either. I happen to be a friend of the district
attorney's; and I know exactly what's being done. The police are
scouting round in a perfect frenzy of activity, and it's hard to
say what trail they'll strike next. I thought, don't y' know, I
might save you a lot of unpleasantness by a friendly little
chat...Of course," he added, "if you prefer to have me give your
name to the police, I'll do so, and let them hold the audience in
their own inimitable but crude fashion. I might say, however, that,
as yet, they are blissfully unaware of your relationship with Miss
Odell, and that, if you are reasonable, I see no reason why they
should be informed of it."</p>

<p>The girl had stood, one hand on the telephone, studying Vance
intently. He had spoken carelessly and with a genial inflection;
and she at length resumed her seat.</p>

<p>"Now, won't you have one of my cigarettes?" he asked, in a tone
of gracious reconciliation.</p>

<p>Mechanically she accepted his offer, keeping her eyes on him all
the time, as if attempting to determine how far he was to be
trusted.</p>

<p>"Who are they thinking of arresting?" She asked the question
with scarcely a movement of her features.</p>

<p>"A johnny named Skeel. Silly idea, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Him!" Her tone was one of mingled contempt and disgust. "That
cheap crook? He hasn't got nerve enough to strangle a cat."</p>

<p>"Precisely. But that's no reason for sending him to the electric
chair, what?" Vance leaned forward and smiled engagingly. "Miss La
Fosse, if you will talk to me for five minutes, and forget I'm a
stranger, I'll give you my word of honor not to let the police or
the district attorney know anything about you. I'm not connected
with the authorities, but somehow I dislike the idea of seeing the
wrong man punished. And I'll promise to forget the source of any
information you will be kind enough to give me. If you will trust
me, it will be infinitely easier for you in the end."</p>

<p>The girl made no answer for several minutes. She was, I could
see, trying to estimate Vance; and evidently she decided that, in
any case, she had nothing to lose&mdash;now that her friendship
with the Canary had been discovered&mdash;by talking to this man
who had promised her immunity from further annoyance.</p>

<p>"I guess you're all right," she said, with a reservation of
dubiety; "but I don't know why I should think so." She paused.
"But, look here: I was told to keep out of this. And if I don't
keep out of it, I'm apt to be back hoofing it in the chorus again.
And that's no life for a sweet young thing like me with extravagant
tastes&mdash;believe me, my friend!"</p>

<p>"That calamity will never befall you through any lack of
discretion on my part," Vance assured her, with good-natured
earnestness... "Who told you to keep out of it?"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;fianc&eacute;" She spoke somewhat coquettishly. "He's
very well known and he's afraid there might be scandal if I got
mixed up in the case as a witness, or anything like that."</p>

<p>"I can readily understand his feelings." Vance nodded
sympathetically. "And who, by the bye, is this luckiest of
men?"</p>

<p>"Say! You're good." She complimented him with a coy <i>moue.</i>
"But I'm not announcing my engagement yet."</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid," begged Vance. "You know perfectly well that I
could find out his name by making a few inquiries. And if you drove
me to learn the facts elsewhere, then my promise to keep your name
a secret would no longer bind me."</p>

<p>Miss La Fosse considered this point.</p>

<p>"I guess you could find out all right...so I might as well tell
you&mdash;only I'm trusting to your word to protect me." She opened
her eyes wide and gave Vance a melting look. "I know you wouldn't
let me down."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss La Fosse!" His tone was one of pained
surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, my fianc&eacute; is Mr. Mannix, and he's the head of a
big fur-importing house...You see"&mdash;she became clingingly
confidential&mdash;"Louey&mdash;that is, Mr. Mannix&mdash;used to
go round with Margy. That's why he didn't want me to get mixed up
in the affair. He said the police might bother him with questions,
and his name might get into the papers. And that would hurt his
commercial standing."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," murmured Vance. "And do you happen to know
where Mr. Mannix was Monday night?"</p>

<p>The girl looked startled.</p>

<p>"Of course I know. He was right here with me from half past ten
until two in the morning. We were discussing a new musical show he
was interested in; and he wanted me to take the leading role."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it will be a success." Vance spoke with disarming
friendliness. "Were you home alone all Monday evening?"</p>

<p>"Hardly." The idea seemed to amuse her. "I went to the
<i>Scandals</i>&mdash;but I came home early. I knew Louey&mdash;Mr.
Mannix&mdash;was coming."</p>

<p>"I trust he appreciated your sacrifice." Vance, I believe, was
disappointed by this unexpected alibi of Mannix's. It was, indeed,
so final that further interrogation concerning it seemed futile.
After a momentary pause; he changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Tell me; what do you know about a Mr. Charles Cleaver? He was a
friend of Miss Odell's."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pop's all right." The girl was plainly relieved by this
turn in the conversation. "A good scout. He was certainly gone on
Margy. Even after she threw him over for Mr. Spotswoode, he was
faithful, as you might say&mdash;always running after her, sending
her flowers and presents. Some men are like that. Poor old Pop! He
even phoned me Monday night to call up Margy for him and try to
arrange a party. Maybe if I'd done it, she wouldn't be dead
now...It's a funny world, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no end funny." Vance smoked calmly for a minute; I could
not help admiring his self-control. "What time did Mr. Cleaver
phone you Monday night&mdash;do you recall?" From his voice one
would have thought the question of no importance.</p>

<p>"Let me see..." She pursed her lips prettily. "It was just ten
minutes to twelve. I remember that the little chime clock on the
mantel over there was striking midnight, and at first I couldn't
hear Pop very well. You see, I always keep my clock ten minutes
fast so I'll never be late for an appointment."</p>

<p>Vance compared the clock with his watch.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's ten minutes fast. And what about the party?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was too busy talking about the new show, and I had to
refuse. Anyway, Mr. Mannix didn't want to have a party that
night...It wasn't my fault was it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," Vance assured her. "Work comes before
pleasure&mdash;especially work as important as yours...And now,
there is one other man I want to ask you about, and then I won't
bother you any more.&mdash;What was the situation between Miss
Odell and Doctor Lindquist?"</p>

<p>Miss La Fosse became genuinely perturbed.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you were going to ask me about him." There was
apprehension in her eyes. "I don't know just what to say. He was
wildly in love with Margy; and she led him on, too. But she was
sorry for it afterward, because he got jealous&mdash;like a crazy
person. He used to pester the life out of her. And once&mdash;do
you know!&mdash;he threatened to shoot her and then shoot himself.
I told Margy to look out for him. But she didn't seem to be afraid.
Anyway, I think she was taking awful chances...Oh! Do you think it
could have been&mdash;do you really think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"And wasn't there anyone else," Vance interrupted, "who might
have felt the same way? Anyone Miss Odell had reason to fear?"</p>

<p>"No." Miss La Fosse shook her head. "Margy didn't know many men
intimately. She didn't change often, if you know what I mean. There
wasn't anybody else outside of those you've mentioned, except, of
course, Mr. Spotswoode. He cut Pop out several months ago. She went
to dinner with him Monday night, too. I wanted her to go to the
<i>Scandals</i> with me&mdash;that's how I know."</p>

<p>Vance rose and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"You've been very kind. And you have nothing whatever to fear.
No one shall ever know of our little visit this morning."</p>

<p>"Who do you think killed Margy?" There was genuine emotion in
the girl's voice. "Louey says it was probably some burglar who
wanted her jewels."</p>

<p>"I'm too wise to sow discord in this happy m&eacute;nage by even
questioning Mr. Mannix's opinion," said Vance half banteringly. "No
one <i>knows</i> who's guilty; but the police agree with Mr.
Mannix."</p>

<p>For a moment the girl's doubts returned, and she gave Vance a
searching look. "Why are you so interested? You didn't know Margy,
did you? She never mentioned you."</p>

<p>Vance laughed. "My dear child! I only wish I knew why I am so
deuced concerned in this affair. 'Pon my word, I can't give you
even the sketchiest explanation...No, I never met Miss Odell. But
it would offend my sense of proportion if Mr. Skeel were punished
and the real culprit went free. Maybe I'm getting sentimental. A
sad fate, what?"</p>

<p>"I guess I'm getting soft, too." She nodded her head, still
looking Vance square in the eyes. "I risked my happy home to tell
you what I did, because somehow I believed you...Say, you weren't
stringing me, by any chance?"</p>

<p>Vance put his hand to his heart, and became serious.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss La Fosse, when I leave here it will be as though I
had never entered. Dismiss me and Mr. Van Dine here from your
mind."</p>

<p>Something in his manner banished her misgivings, and she bade us
a kittenish farewell.</p>

<h2>17 - CHECKING AN ALIBI</h2>

<p><i>(Thursday, September 13; afternoon)</i>
</p>

<p>"My sleuthing goes better," exulted Vance, when we were again in
the street. "Fair Alys was a veritable mine of
information&mdash;eh, what? Only, you should have controlled
yourself better when she mentioned her beloved's name&mdash;really,
you should, Van old thing. I saw you jump and heard you heave. Such
emotion is unbecoming in a lawyer."</p>

<p>From a booth in a drugstore near the hotel he telephoned
Markham: "I am taking you to lunch. I have numerous confidences I
would pour into your ear." A debate ensued, but in the end Vance
emerged triumphant; and a moment later a taxicab was driving us
downtown.</p>

<p>"Alys is clever&mdash;there are brains in that fluffy head," he
ruminated. "She's much smarter than Heath; she knew at once that
Skeel wasn't guilty. Her characterization of the immaculate Tony
was inelegant but how accurate&mdash;oh, how accurate! And you
noticed, of course, how she trusted me. Touchin', wasn't it?...It's
a knotty problem, Van. Something's amiss somewhere."</p>

<p>He was silent, smoking, for several blocks.</p>

<p>"Mannix...Curious he should crop up again. And he issued orders
to Alys to keep mum. Now, why? Maybe the reason he gave her was the
real one. Who knows? On the other hand, was he with his
<i>ch&egrave;re amie</i> from half past ten till early morning?
Well, well. Again, who knows? Something queer about that business
discussion...Then Cleaver. He called up just ten minutes before
midnight&mdash;oh, yes, he called up. That wasn't a fairytale. But
how could he telephone from a speeding car? He couldn't. Maybe he
really wanted to have a party with his recalcitrant Canary, don't
y' know. But, then, why the brummagem alibi? Funk? Maybe. But why
the circuitousness? Why didn't he call his lost love direct? Ah,
perhaps he did! Someone certainly called her by phone at twenty
minutes to twelve. We must look into that, Van... Yes, he may have
called her, and then when a man answered&mdash;who the deuce was
that man, anyway?&mdash;he may have appealed to Alys. Quite
natural, y' know. Anyway, he wasn't in Boonton. Poor Markham! How
upset he'll be when he finds out!...But what really worries me is
that story of the doctor. Jealous mania: it squares with Ambroise's
character perfectly. He's the kind that does go off his head. I
knew his confession of paternalism was a red herring. My word! So
the doctor was making threats and flourishing pistols, eh? Bad,
bad. I don't like it. With those ears of his, he wouldn't hesitate
to pull the trigger. Paranoia&mdash;that's it. Delusions of
persecution. Probably thought the girl and Pop&mdash;or maybe the
girl and Spotswoode&mdash;were plotting his misery and laughing at
him. You can't tell about those chaps. They're deep and they're
dangerous. The canny Alys had him sized up&mdash;warned the Canary
against him...Taken by and large, it's a devilish tangle. Anyway, I
feel rather bucked. We're moving&mdash;oh, undoubtedly we're
moving&mdash;though in what direction I can't even guess. It's
beastly annoyin'."</p>

<p>Markham was waiting for us at the Bankers' Club. He greeted
Vance irritably. "What have you got to tell me that's so damned
important?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't get ratty." Vance was beaming. "How's your lodestar,
Skeel, behaving?"</p>

<p>"So far he's done everything that's pure and refined except join
the Christian Endeavor Society."</p>

<p>"Sunday's coming. Give him time...So you're not happy, Markham
dear?"</p>

<p>"Was I dragged away from another engagement to report on my
state of mind?"</p>

<p>"No need. Your state of mind's execrable...Cheerio! I've brought
you something to think about."</p>

<p>"Damn it! I've got too much to think about now."</p>

<p>"Here, have some brioche." Vance gave the order for lunch
without consulting either of us. "And now for my revelations.
<i>Imprimis:</i> Pop Cleaver wasn't in Boonton last Monday night.
He was very much in the midst of our modern Gomorrah, trying to
arrange a midnight party."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" snorted Markham. "I lave in the font of your
wisdom. His alter ego, I take it, was on the road to Hopatcong. The
supernatural leaves me cold."</p>

<p>"You may be as pancosmic as you choose. Cleaver was in New York
at midnight Monday, craving excitement."</p>

<p>"What about the summons for speeding?"</p>

<p>"That's for you to explain. But if you'll take my advice, you'll
send for this Boonton catchpole and let him have a look at Pop. If
he says Cleaver is the man he ticketed, I'll humbly do away with
myself."</p>

<p>"Well! That makes it worth trying. I'll have the officer at the
Stuyvesant Club this afternoon and I'll point out Cleaver to him...
What other staggering revelations have you in store?"</p>

<p>"Mannix will bear looking into."</p>

<p>Markham put down his knife and fork and leaned back. "I'm
overcome! Such Himalayan sagacity! With that evidence against him,
he should be arrested at once...Vance, my dear old friend, are you
feeling quite normal? No dizzy spells lately? No shooting pains in
the head? Knee jerks all right?"</p>

<p>"Furthermore, Doctor Lindquist was wildly infatuated with the
Canary, and insanely jealous. Recently threatened to take a pistol
and hold a little pogrom of his own."</p>

<p>"That's better." Markham sat up. "Where did you get this
information?"</p>

<p>"Ah! That's my secret."</p>

<p>Markham was annoyed.</p>

<p>"Why so mysterious?"</p>

<p>"Needs must, old chap. Gave my word and all that sort of thing.
And I'm a bit quixotic, don't y' know&mdash;too much Cervantes in
my youth." He spoke lightly, but Markham knew him too well to push
the question.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes after we had returned to the district
attorney's office, Heath came in.</p>

<p>"I got something else on Mannix, sir; thought you might want to
add it to the report I turned in yesterday. Burke secured a picture
of him and showed it to the phone operators at Odell's house. Both
of 'em recognized it. He's been there several times, but it wasn't
the Canary he called on. It was the woman in Apartment 2. She's
named Frisbee and used to be one of Mannix's fur models. He's been
to see her several times during the past six months and has taken
her out once or twice; but he hasn't called on her for a month or
more...Any good?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell." Markham shot Vance an inquisitive look. "But
thanks for the information, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"By the bye," said Vance dulcetly, when Heath had left us, "I'm
feeling tophole. No pains in the head; no dizzy spells. Knee jerks
perfect."</p>

<p>"Delighted. Still, I can't charge a man with murder because he
calls on his fur model."</p>

<p>"You're so hasty! Why should you charge him with murder?" Vance
rose and yawned. "Come, Van. I'd rather like to gaze on Perneb's
tomb at the Metropolitan this afternoon. Could you bear it?" At the
door he paused. "I say, Markham, what about the Boonton bailiff?"
Markham rang for Swacker. "I'll see to it at once. Drop in at the
club around five, if you feel like it. I'll have the officer there
then, as Cleaver is sure to come in before dinner."</p>

<p>When Vance and I returned to the club late that afternoon,
Markham was stationed in the lounge room facing the main door of
the rotunda; and beside him sat a tall, heavyset, bronzed man of
about forty, alert but ill at ease.</p>

<p>"Traffic Officer Phipps arrived from Boonton a little while
ago," said Markham, by way of introduction. "Cleaver is expected at
any moment now. He has an appointment here at half past five."</p>

<p>Vance drew up a chair.</p>

<p>"I do hope he's a punctual beggar."</p>

<p>"So do I," returned Markham viciously. "I'm looking forward to
your <i>felo-de-se."</i></p>

<p>"'Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair,'" murmured
Vance.</p>

<p>Less than ten minutes later Cleaver entered the rotunda from the
street, paused at the desk, and sauntered into the lounge room.
There was no escaping the observation point Markham had chosen; and
as he walked by us he paused and exchanged greetings. Markham
detained him a moment with a few casual questions; and then Cleaver
passed on.</p>

<p>"That the man you ticketed, Officer?" asked Markham, turning to
Phipps.</p>

<p>Phipps was scowling perplexedly. "It looks something like him,
sir; there's a kind of resemblance. But it ain't him." He shook his
head. "No, sir; it ain't him. The fellow I hung a summons on was
stouter than this gent and wasn't as tall."</p>

<p>"You're positive?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;no mistake. The guy I tagged tried to argue with
me and then he tried to slip me a flyer to forget it. I had my
headlight on him full."</p>

<p>Phipps was dismissed with a substantial <i>pourboire.</i></p>

<p><i>"Vae misero mihi!"</i> sighed Vance. "My worthless existence
is to be prolonged. Sad. But you must try to bear it...I say,
Markham, what does Pop Cleaver's brother look like?"</p>

<p>"That's it," nodded Markham. "I've met his brother; he's shorter
and stouter...This thing is getting beyond me. I think I'll have it
out with Cleaver now."</p>

<p>He started to rise, but Vance forced him back into his seat.</p>

<p>"Don't be impetuous. Cultivate patience. Cleaver's not going to
do a bunk; and there are one or two prelimin'ry steps strongly
indicated. Mannix and Lindquist still seduce my curiosity."</p>

<p>Markham clung to his point. "Neither Mannix nor Lindquist is
here now, and Cleaver is. And I want to know why he lied to me
about that summons."</p>

<p>"I can tell you that," said Vance. "He wanted you to think he
was in the wilds of New Jersey at midnight Monday. Simple,
what?"</p>

<p>"The inference is a credit to your intelligence! But I hope you
don't seriously think that Cleaver is guilty. It's possible he
knows something; but I certainly cannot picture him as a
strangler."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"He's not the type. It's inconceivable&mdash;even if there were
evidence against him."</p>

<p>"Ah! The psychological judgment! You eliminate Cleaver because
you don't think his nature harmonizes with the situation. I say,
doesn't that come perilously near being an esoteric
hypothesis?&mdash;or a metaphysical deduction?...However, I don't
entirely agree with you in your application of the theory to
Cleaver. That fish-eyed gambler has unsuspected potentialities for
evil. But with the theory itself I am wholly in accord. And behold,
my dear Markham: you yourself apply psychology in its abecedarian
implications, yet ridicule my application of it in its higher
developments. Consistency may be the hobgoblin of little minds, y'
know, but it's nonetheless a priceless jewel... How about a cup of
tea?"</p>

<p>We sought the Palm Room and sat down at a table near the
entrance. Vance ordered oolong tea, but Markham and I took black
coffee. A very capable four-piece orchestra was playing
Tchaikovsky's <i>Casse-Noisette Suite,</i> and we sat restfully in
the comfortable chairs without speaking. Markham was tired and
dispirited, and Vance was busy with the problem that had absorbed
him continuously since Tuesday morning. Never before had I seen him
so preoccupied.</p>

<p>We had been there perhaps half an hour when Spotswoode strolled
in. He stopped and spoke, and Markham asked him to join us. He,
too, appeared depressed, and his eyes showed signs of worry.</p>

<p>"I hardly dare ask you, Mr. Markham," he said diffidently, after
he had ordered a ginger ale, "but how do my chances stand now of
being called as a witness?"</p>

<p>"That fate is certainly no nearer than when I last saw you,"
Markham replied. "In fact, nothing has happened to change the
situation materially."</p>

<p>"And the man you had under suspicion?"</p>

<p>"He's still under suspicion, but no arrest has been made. We're
hoping, however, that something will break before long."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you still want me to remain in the city?"</p>

<p>"If you can arrange it&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Spotswoode was silent for a time; then he said, "I don't want to
appear to shirk any responsibility&mdash;and perhaps it may seem
wholly selfish for me even to suggest it&mdash;but, in any event,
wouldn't the testimony of the telephone operator as to the hour of
Miss Odell's return and her calls for help be sufficient to
establish the facts, without my corroboration?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that, of course; and if it is at all possible
to prepare the case for the prosecution without summoning you to
appear, I assure you it will be done. At the moment, I can see no
necessity of your being called as a witness. But one never knows
what may turn up. If the defense hinges on a question of exact
time, and the operator's testimony is questioned or disqualified
for any reason, you may be required to come forward. Otherwise
not."</p>

<p>Spotswoode sipped his ginger ale. A little of his depression
seemed to have departed.</p>

<p>"You're very generous, Mr. Markham. I wish there was some
adequate way of thanking you." He looked up hesitantly. "I presume
you are still opposed to my visiting the apartment...I know you
think me unreasonable and perhaps sentimental; but the girl
represented something in my life that I find very difficult to tear
out. I don't expect you to understand it&mdash;I hardly understand
it myself."</p>

<p>"I think it's easily understandable, don't y' know," remarked
Vance, with a sympathy I had rarely seen him manifest. "Your
attitude needs no apology. History and fable are filled with the
same situation, and the protagonists have always exhibited
sentiments similar to yours. Your most famous prototype, of course,
was Odysseus on the citron-scented isle of Ogygia with the
fascinatin' Calypso. The soft arms of sirens have gone snaking
round men's necks ever since the red-haired Lilith worked her
devastatin' wiles on the impressionable Adam. We're all sons of
that racy old boy."</p>

<p>Spotswoode smiled. "You at least give me an historic
background," he said. Then he turned to Markham. "What will become
of Miss Odell's possessions&mdash;her furniture and so forth?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Heath heard from an aunt of hers in Seattle," Markham
told him. "She's on her way to New York, I believe, to take over
what there is of the estate."</p>

<p>"And everything will be kept intact until then?"</p>

<p>"Probably longer, unless something unexpected happens. Anyway,
until then."</p>

<p>"There are one or two little trinkets I'd like to keep,"
Spotswoode confessed, a bit shamefacedly, I thought.</p>

<p>After a few more minutes of desultory talk he rose and, pleading
an engagement, bade us good afternoon.</p>

<p>"I hope I can keep his name clear of the case," said Markham,
when he had gone.</p>

<p>"Yes; his situation is not an enviable one," concurred Vance.
"It's always sad to be found out. The moralist would set it down to
retribution."</p>

<p>"In this instance chance was certainly on the side of
righteousness. If he hadn't chosen Monday night for the Winter
Garden, he might now be in the bosom of his family, with nothing
more troublesome to bother him than a guilty conscience."</p>

<p>"It certainly looks that way." Vance glanced at his watch. "And
your mention of the Winter Garden reminds me. Do you mind if we
dine early? Frivolity beckons me tonight. I'm going to the
<i>Scandals."</i></p>

<p>We both looked at him as though he had taken leave of his
senses.</p>

<p>"Don't be so horrified, my Markham. Why should I not indulge an
impulse?...And, incidentally, I hope to have glad tidings for you
by lunchtime tomorrow."</p>

<h2>18 - THE TRAP</h2>

<p><i>(Friday, September 14; noon)</i>
</p>

<p>Vance slept late the following day. I had accompanied him to the
<i>Scandals</i> the night before, utterly at a loss to understand
his strange desire to attend a type of entertainment which I knew
he detested. At noon he ordered his car, and instructed the
chauffeur to drive to the Belafield Hotel.</p>

<p>"We are about to call again on the allurin' Alys," he said. "I'd
bring posies to lay at her shrine, but I fear dear Mannix might
question her unduly about them."</p>

<p>Miss La Fosse received us with an air of crestfallen
resentment.</p>

<p>"I might've known it!" She nodded her head with sneering
perception. "I suppose you've come to tell me the cops found out
about me without the slightest assistance from you." Her disdain
was almost magnificent. "Did you bring 'em with you?...A swell guy
<i>you</i> are!&mdash;But it's my own fault for being a damn
fool."</p>

<p>Vance waited unmoved until she had finished her contemptuous
tirade. Then he bowed pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, I merely dropped in to pay my respects, and to
tell you that the police have turned in their report of Miss
Odell's acquaintances, and that your name was not mentioned on it.
You seemed a little worried yesterday on that score, and it
occurred to me I could set your mind wholly at ease."</p>

<p>The vigilance of her attitude relaxed. "Is that straight?...My
God! I don't know what would happen if Louey'd find out I'd been
blabbing."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he won't find out, unless you choose to tell him...
Won't you be generous and ask me to sit down a moment?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;I'm so sorry. I'm just having my coffee. Please
join me." She rang for two extra services.</p>

<p>Vance had drunk two cups of coffee less than half an hour
before, and I marveled at his enthusiasm for this atrocious hotel
beverage.</p>

<p>"I was a belated spectator of the <i>Scandals</i> last night,"
he remarked in a negligent, conversational tone. "I missed the
revue earlier in the season. How is it you yourself were so late in
seeing it?"</p>

<p>"I've been so busy," she confided. "I was rehearsing for 'A Pair
of Queens'; but the production's been postponed. Louey couldn't get
the theater he wanted."</p>

<p>"Do you like revues?" asked Vance. "I should think they'd be
more difficult for the principals than the ordin'ry musical
comedy."</p>

<p>"They are." Miss La Fosse adopted a professional air. "And
they're unsatisfactory. The individual is lost in them. There's no
real scope for one's talent. They're breathless if you know what I
mean."</p>

<p>"I should imagine so." Vance bravely sipped his coffee. "And
yet, there were several numbers in the <i>Scandals</i> that you
could have done charmingly; they seemed particularly designed for
you. I thought of you doing them, and&mdash;d' ye know?&mdash;the
thought rather spoiled my enjoyment of the young lady who appeared
in them."</p>

<p>"You flatter me, Mr. Vance. But, really, I have a good voice.
I've studied very hard. And I learned dancing with Professor
Markoff."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" (I'm sure Vance had never heard the name before, but
his exclamation seemed to imply that he regarded Professor Markoff
as one of the world's most renowned ballet masters.) "Then, you
certainly should have been starred in the <i>Scandals.</i> The
young lady I have in mind sang rather indifferently, and her
dancing was most inadequate. Moreover, she was many degrees your
inferior in personality and attractiveness...Confess: didn't you
have just a little desire Monday night to be singing the 'Chinese
Lullaby' song?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know." Miss La Fosse carefully considered the
suggestion. "They kept the lights awfully low; and I don't look so
well in cerise. But the costumes were adorable, weren't they?"</p>

<p>"On you they certainly would have been adorable...What color are
you partial to?"</p>

<p>"I love the orchid shades," she told him enthusiastically;
"though I don't look at all bad in turquoise blue. But an artist
once told me I should always wear white. He wanted to paint my
portrait, but the gentleman I was engaged to then didn't like
him."</p>

<p>Vance regarded her appraisingly.</p>

<p>"I think your artist friend was right. And, y' know, the St.
Moritz scene in the <i>Scandals</i> would have suited you
perfectly. The little brunette who sang the snow song, all in
white, was delightful; but really, now, she should have had golden
hair. Dusky beauties belong to the southern climes. And she
impressed me as lacking the sparkle and vitality of a Swiss resort
in midwinter. You could have supplied those qualities
admirably."</p>

<p>"Yes; I'd have liked that better than the Chinese number, I
think. White fox is my favorite fur, too. But, even so, in a revue
you're on in one number and off in another. When it's all over,
you're forgotten." She sighed unhappily.</p>

<p>Vance set down his cup and looked at her with whimsically
reproachful eyes. After a moment he said, "My dear, why did you fib
to me about the time Mr. Mannix returned to you last Monday night?
It wasn't a bit nice of you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Miss La Fosse exclaimed in frightened
indignation, drawing herself up into an attitude of withering
hauteur.</p>

<p>"You see," explained Vance, "the St. Moritz scene of the
<i>Scandals</i> doesn't go on until nearly eleven, and it closes
the bill. So you couldn't possible have seen it and also received
Mr. Mannix here at half past ten. Come. What time did he arrive
here Monday night?"</p>

<p>The girl flushed angrily. "You're pretty slick, aren't you? You
shoulda been a cop...Well, what if I didn't get home till after the
show? Any crime in that?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," answered Vance mildly. "Only a little breach of
good faith in telling me you came home early." He bent forward
earnestly. "I'm not here to make you trouble. On the contr'ry, I'd
like to protect you from any distress or bother. You see, if the
police go nosing round, they may run on to you. But if I'm able to
give the district attorney accurate information about certain
things connected with Monday night, there'll be no danger of the
police being sent to look for you."</p>

<p>Miss La Fosse's eyes grew suddenly hard, and her brow crinkled
with determination. "Listen! I haven't got anything to hide, and
neither has Louey. But if Louey asks me to say he's somewhere at
half past ten, I'm going to say it&mdash;see? That's my idea of
friendship. Louey had some good reason to ask it, too, or he
wouldn't have done it. However, since you're so smart, and have
accused me of playing unfair, I'm going to tell you that he didn't
get in till after midnight. But if anybody else asks me about it,
I'll see 'em in hell before I tell 'em anything but the
half-past-ten story. Get that?"</p>

<p>Vance bowed. "I get it; and I like you for it."</p>

<p>"But don't go away with the wrong idea," she hurried on, her
eyes sparkling with fervor. "Louey may not have got here till after
midnight, but if you think he knows anything about Margy's death,
you're crazy. He was through with Margy a year ago. Why, he hardly
knew she was on earth. And if any fool cop gets the notion in his
head that Louey was mixed up in the affair, I'll alibi him&mdash;so
help me God!&mdash;if it's the last thing I do in this world."</p>

<p>"I like you more and more," said Vance; and when she gave him
her hand at parting he lifted it to his lips.</p>

<p>As we rode downtown Vance was thoughtful. We were nearly to the
Criminal Courts Building before he spoke.</p>

<p>"The primitive Alys rather appeals to me," he said. "She's much
too good for the oleaginous Mannix...Women are so shrewd&mdash;and
so gullible. A woman can read a man with almost magical insight;
but, on the other hand, she is inexpressibly blind when it comes to
<i>her</i> man. Witness sweet Alys's faith in Mannix. He probably
told her he was slaving at the office Monday night. Naturally, she
doesn't believe it; but she knows&mdash;<i>knows</i><i>,</i> mind
you&mdash;that her Louey just couldn't have been concerned in the
Canary's death. Ah, well, let us hope she's right and that Mannix
is not apprehended&mdash;at least not until her new show is
financed...My word! If this being a detective involves many more
revues, I shall have to resign. Thank Heaven, though, the lady
didn't attend the cinema Monday night!"</p>

<p>When we arrived at the District Attorney's office we found Heath
and Markham in consultation. Markham had a pad before him, several
pages of which were covered with tabulated and annotated entries. A
cloud of cigar smoke enveloped him. Heath sat facing him, his
elbows on the table, his chin resting in his hands. He looked
pugnacious but disconsolate.</p>

<p>"I'm going over the case with the sergeant," Markham explained,
with a brief glance in our direction. "We're trying to get all the
salient points down in some kind of order, to see if there are any
connecting links we've overlooked. I've told the sergeant about the
doctor's infatuation and his threats, and of the failure of Traffic
Officer Phipps to identify Cleaver. But the more we learn, the
worse, apparently, the jumble grows."</p>

<p>He picked up the sheets of paper and fastened them together with
a clip. "The truth is, we haven't any real evidence against
anybody. There are suspicious circumstances connected with Skeel
and Doctor Lindquist and Cleaver; and our interview with Mannix
didn't precisely allay suspicions in his direction, either. But
when we come right down to it, what's the situation! We've got some
fingerprints of Skeel, which might have been made late Monday
afternoon. Doctor Lindquist goes berserk when we ask him where he
was Monday night, and then offers us a weak alibi. He admits a
fatherly interest in the girl, whereas he's really in love with
her&mdash;a perfectly natural bit of mendacity. Cleaver lent his
car to his brother and lied about it, so that I'd think he was in
Boonton Monday at midnight. And Mannix gives us a number of shifty
answers to our questions concerning his relations with the girl...
Not an embarrassment of riches."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say your information was exactly negligent,"
observed Vance, taking a chair beside the sergeant. "It may all
prove devilish valuable if only it could be put together properly.
The difficulty, it appears to me, is that certain parts of the
puzzle are missing. Find 'em, and I'll warrant everything will fit
beautifully&mdash;like a mosaic."</p>

<p>"Easy enough to say 'find 'em,'" grumbled Markham. "The trouble
is to know where to look."</p>

<p>Heath relighted his dead cigar and made an impatient
gesture.</p>

<p>"You can't get away from Skeel. He's the boy that did it, and,
if it wasn't for Abe Rubin, I'd sweat the truth outa him. And by
the way, Mr. Vance, he had his own private key to the Odell
apartment, all right." He glanced at Markham hesitantly. "I don't
want to look as if I was criticising, sir, but I got a feeling
we're wasting time chasing after these gentlemen friends of
Odell&mdash;Cleaver and Mannix and this here doctor."</p>

<p>"You may be right." Markham seemed inclined to agree with him.
"However, I'd like to know why Lindquist acted the way he did."</p>

<p>"Well, that might help some," Heath compromised. "If the doc was
so far gone on Odell as to threaten to shoot her, and if he went
off his head when you asked him to alibi himself, maybe he could
tell us something. Why not throw a little scare into him? His
record ain't any too good, anyway."</p>

<p>"An excellent idea," chimed in Vance.</p>

<p>Markham looked up sharply. Then he consulted his appointment
book. "I'm fairly free this afternoon, so suppose you bring him
down here, Sergeant. Get a subpoena if you have to&mdash;only see
that he comes. And make it as soon after lunch as you can." He
tapped on the desk irritably. "If I don't do anything else, I'm
going to eliminate some of this human flotsam that's cluttering up
the case. And Lindquist is as good as any to start with. I'll
either develop these various suspicious circumstances into
something workable or I'll root them up. Then we'll see where we
stand."</p>

<p>Heath shook hands pessimistically and went out.</p>

<p>"Poor hapless man!" sighed Vance, looking after him. "He giveth
way to all the pangs and fury of despair."</p>

<p>"And so would you," snapped Markham, "if the newspapers were
butchering you for a political holiday. By the way, weren't you to
be a harbinger of glad tidings this noon, or something of the
sort?"</p>

<p>"I believe I did hold out some such hope." Vance sat looking
meditatively out of the window for several minutes. "Markham, this
fellow Mannix lures me like a magnet. He irks and whirrets me. He
infests my slumbers. He's the raven on my bust of Pallas. He
plagues me like a banshee."</p>

<p>"Does this jeremiad come under the head of tidings?"</p>

<p>"I sha'n't rest peacefully," pursued Vance, "until I know where
Louey the furrier was between eleven o'clock and midnight Monday.
He was somewhere he shouldn't have been. And you, Markham, must
find out. Please make Mannix the second offensive in your assault
upon the flotsam. He'll parley, with the right amount of pressure.
Be brutal, old dear; let him think you suspect him of the
throttling. Ask him about the fur model&mdash;what's her
name?&mdash;Frisbee&mdash;" He stopped short and knit his brows.
"My eye&mdash;oh, my eye! I wonder...Yes, yes, Markham; you must
question him about the fur model. Ask him when he saw her last, and
try to look wise and mysterious when you're doing it."</p>

<p>"See here, Vance"&mdash;Markham was exasperated&mdash;"you've
been harping on Mannix for three days. What's keeping your nose to
that scent?"</p>

<p>"Intuition&mdash;sheer intuition. My psychic temperament, don't
y' know."</p>

<p>"I'd believe that if I hadn't known you for fifteen years."
Markham inspected him shrewdly, then shrugged his shoulders. "I'll
have Mannix on the tapis when I'm through with Lindquist."</p>

<h2>19 - THE DOCTOR EXPLAINS</h2>

<p><i>(Friday, September 14; 2 P.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>We lunched in the district attorney's private sanctum; and at
two o'clock Doctor Lindquist was announced. Heath accompanied him,
and, from the expression on the sergeant's face, it was plain he
did not at all like his companion.</p>

<p>The doctor, at Markham's request, seated himself facing the
district attorney's desk.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this new outrage?" he demanded coldly.
"Is it your prerogative to force a citizen to leave his private
affairs in order to be bullied?"</p>

<p>"It's my duty to bring murderers to justice," replied Markham,
with equal coldness. "And if any citizen considers that giving aid
to the authorities is an outrage, that's <i>his</i> prerogative. If
you have anything to fear by answering my questions, Doctor, you
are entitled to have your attorney present. Would you care to phone
him to come here now and give you legal protection?"</p>

<p>Doctor Lindquist hesitated. "I need no legal protection, sir.
Will you be good enough to tell me at once why I was brought
here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; to explain a few points which have been discovered
regarding your relationship with Miss Odell, and to
elucidate&mdash;if you care to&mdash;your reasons for deceiving me,
at our last conference, in regard to that relationship."</p>

<p>"You have, I infer, been prying unwarrantably into my private
affairs. I had heard that such practices were once common in
Russia..."</p>

<p>"If the prying was unwarranted, you can, Doctor Lindquist,
easily convince me on that point; and whatever we may have learned
concerning you will be instantly forgotten. It is true, is it not,
that your interest in Miss Odell went somewhat beyond mere paternal
affection?"</p>

<p>"Are not even a man's sacred sentiments respected by the police
of this country?" There was insolent scorn in the doctor's
tone.</p>

<p>"Under some conditions, yes; under others, no." Markham
controlled his fury admirably. "You need not answer me, of course;
but, if you choose to be frank, you may possibly save yourself the
humiliation of being questioned publicly by the people's attorney
in a court of law."</p>

<p>Doctor Lindquist winced and considered the matter at some
length. "And if I admit that my affection for Miss Odell was other
than paternal&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>Markham accepted the question as an affirmation.</p>

<p>"You were intensely jealous of her, were you not, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Jealousy," Doctor Lindquist remarked, with an air of ironic
professionalism, "is not an unusual accompaniment to an
infatuation. Authorities such as Kraft-Ebing, Moll, Freud,
Ferenczi, and Adler, I believe, regard it as an intimate
psychological corollary of amatory attraction."</p>

<p>"Most instructive." Markham nodded his head appreciatively. "I
am to assume, then, that you were infatuated with&mdash;or, let us
say, amatorily attracted by&mdash;Miss Odell, and that on occasions
you exhibited the intimate psychological corollary of
jealousy?"</p>

<p>"You may assume what you please. But I fail to understand why my
emotions are any of your affair."</p>

<p>"Had your emotions not led you to highly questionable and
suspicious acts, I would not be interested in them. But I have it
on unimpeachable authority that your emotions so reacted on your
better judgment that you threatened to take Miss Odell's life and
also your own. And, in view of the fact that the young woman has
since been murdered, the law naturally&mdash;and
reasonably&mdash;is curious."</p>

<p>The doctor's normally pale face seemed to turn yellow, and his
long splay fingers tightened over the arms of his chair; but
otherwise he sat immobile and rigidly dignified, his eyes fixed
intently on the district attorney.</p>

<p>"I trust," added Markham, "you will not augment my suspicions by
any attempt at denial."</p>

<p>Vance was watching the man closely. Presently he leaned
forward.</p>

<p>"I say, Doctor, what method of extermination did you threaten
Miss Odell with?"</p>

<p>Doctor Lindquist jerked round, thrusting his head toward Vance.
He drew in a long rasping breath, and his whole frame became tense.
Blood suffused his cheeks; and there was a twitching of the muscles
about his mouth and throat. For a moment I was afraid he was going
to lose his self-control. But after a moment's effort he steadied
himself.</p>

<p>"You think perhaps I threatened to strangle her?" His words were
vibrant with the intensity of his passionate anger. "And you would
like to turn my threat into a noose to hang me?&mdash;Paugh!" He
paused, and when he spoke again, his voice had become calmer. "It
is quite true I once inadvisedly attempted to frighten Miss Odell
with a threat to kill her and to commit suicide. But if your
information is as accurate as you would have me believe, you are
aware that I threatened her with a revolver. It is the weapon, I
believe, that is conventionally mentioned when making empty
threats. I certainly would not have threatened her with thuggee,
even had I contemplated so abominable an act."</p>

<p>"True," nodded Vance. "And it's a rather good point, don't y'
know."</p>

<p>The doctor was evidently encouraged by Vance's attitude. He
again faced Markham and elaborated his confession. "A threat, I
presume you know, is rarely the forerunner of a violent deed. Even
a brief study of the human mind would teach you that a threat is
<i>prima facie</i> evidence of one's innocence. A threat,
generally, is made in anger, and acts as its own safety valve." He
shifted his eyes. "I am not a married man; my emotional life has
not been stabilized, as it were; and I am constantly coming in
close contact with hypersensitive and overwrought people. During a
period of abnormal susceptibility I conceived an infatuation for
the young woman, an infatuation which she did not
reciprocate&mdash;certainly not with an ardor commensurate with my
own. I suffered deeply; and she made no effort to mitigate my
sufferings. Indeed, I suspected her, more than once, of
deliberately and perversely torturing me with other men. At any
rate, she took no pains to hide her infidelities from me. I confess
that once or twice I was almost distracted. And it was in the hope
of frightening her into a more amenable and considerate attitude
that I threatened her. I trust that you are a sufficiently
discerning judge of human nature to believe me."</p>

<p>"Leaving that point for a moment," answered Markham
noncommittally, "will you give me more specific information as to
your whereabouts Monday night?"</p>

<p>Again I noted a yellow tinge creep over the man's features, and
his body stiffened perceptibly. But when he spoke, it was with his
habitual suavity.</p>

<p>"I considered that my note to you covered that question
satisfactorily. What did I omit?"</p>

<p>"What was the name of the patient on whom you were calling that
night?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Anna Breedon. She is the widow of the late Amos H. Breedon
of the Breedon National Bank of Long Branch."</p>

<p>"And you were with her, I believe you stated, from eleven until
one?"</p>

<p>"That is correct."</p>

<p>"And was Mrs. Breedon the only witness to your presence at the
sanitarium between those hours?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid that is so. You see, after ten o'clock at night I
never ring the bell. I let myself in with my own key."</p>

<p>"And I suppose that I may be permitted to question Mrs.
Breedon?"</p>

<p>Doctor Lindquist was profoundly regretful. "Mrs. Breedon is a
very ill woman. She suffered a tremendous shock at the time of her
husband's death last summer, and has been practically in a
semiconscious condition ever since. There are times when I even
fear for her reason. The slightest disturbance of excitement might
produce very serious results."</p>

<p>He took a newspaper cutting from a gold-edged letter case and
handed it to Markham.</p>

<p>"You will observe that this obituary notice mentions her
prostration and confinement in a private sanitarium. I have been
her physician for years."</p>

<p>Markham, after glancing at the cutting, handed it back. There
was a short silence broken by a question from Vance.</p>

<p>"By the bye, Doctor, what is the name of the night nurse at your
sanitarium?"</p>

<p>Doctor Lindquist looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"My night nurse? Why&mdash;what has she to do with it? She was
very busy Monday night. I can't understand...Well, if you want her
name I have no objection. It's Finckle&mdash;Miss Amelia
Finckle."</p>

<p>Vance wrote down the name and, rising, carried the slip of paper
to Heath.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, bring Miss Finckle here tomorrow morning at eleven,"
he said, with a slight lowering of one eyelid.</p>

<p>"I sure will, sir. Good idea." His manner boded no good for Miss
Finckle.</p>

<p>A cloud of apprehension spread over Doctor Lindquist's face.</p>

<p>"Forgive me if I say that I am insensible to the sanity of your
cavalier methods." His tone betrayed only contempt. "May I hope
that for the present your inquisition is ended?"</p>

<p>"I think that will be all, Doctor," returned Markham politely.
"May I have a taxicab called for you?"</p>

<p>"Your consideration overwhelms me. But my car is below." And
Doctor Lindquist haughtily withdrew.</p>

<p>Markham immediately summoned Swacker and sent him for Tracy. The
detective came at once, polishing his pince-nez and bowing affably.
One would have taken him for an actor rather than a detective, but
his ability in matters requiring delicate handling was a byword in
the department.</p>

<p>"I want you to fetch Mr. Louis Mannix again," Markham told him.
"Bring him here at once; I'm waiting to see him."</p>

<p>Tracy bowed genially and, adjusting his glasses, departed on his
errand.</p>

<p>"And now," said Markham, fixing Vance with a reproachful look,
"I want to know what your idea was in putting Lindquist on his
guard about the night nurse. Your brain isn't at par this
afternoon. Do you think I didn't have the nurse in mind? And now
you've warned him. He'll have until eleven tomorrow morning to
coach her in her answers. Really, Vance, I can't conceive of
anything better calculated to defeat us in our attempt to
substantiate the man's alibi."</p>

<p>"I did put a little fright into him, didn't I?" Vance grinned
complacently. "Whenever your antagonist begins talking
exaggeratedly about the insanity of your notions, he's already
deuced hot under the collar. But, Markham old thing, don't burst
into tears over my mental shortcomings. If you and I both thought
of the nurse, don't you suppose the wily doctor also thought of
her? If this Miss Finckle were the type that could be suborned, he
would have enlisted her perjurious service two days ago, and she
would have been mentioned, along with the comatose Mrs. Breedon, as
a witness to his presence at the sanitarium Monday night. The fact
that he avoided all reference to the nurse shows that she's not to
be wheedled into swearing falsely...No, Markham. I deliberately put
him on his guard. Now he'll have to do something before we question
Miss Finckle. And I'm vain enough to think I know what it'll
be."</p>

<p>"Let me get this right," put in Heath. "Am I, or am I not, to
round up the Finckle woman tomorrow morning?"</p>

<p>"There'll be no need," said Vance. "We are doomed, I fear, not
to gaze upon this Florence Nightingale. A meeting between us is
about the last thing the doctor would desire."</p>

<p>"That may be true," admitted Markham. "But don't forget that he
may have been up to something Monday night wholly unconnected with
the murder, that he simply doesn't want known."</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;quite. And yet, nearly everyone who knew the Canary
seems to have selected Monday night for the indulgence of <i>sub
rosa</i> peccadilloes. It's a bit thick, what? Skeel tries to make
us believe he was immersed in Khun Khan. Cleaver was&mdash;if you
take his word for it&mdash;touring the countryside in Jersey's lake
district. Lindquist wants us to picture him as comforting the
afflicted. And Mannix, I happen to know, has gone to some trouble
to build up an alibi in case we get nosey. All of 'em, in fact,
were doing something they don't want us to know about. Now, what
was it? And why did they, of one accord, select the night of the
murder for mysterious affairs which they don't dare mention, even
to clear themselves of suspicion? Was there an invasion of efreets
in the city that night? Was there a curse on the world, driving men
to dark bawdy deeds? Was there Black Magic abroad? I think
not."</p>

<p>"I'm laying my money on Skeel," declared Heath stubbornly. "I
know a professional job when I see it. And you can't get away from
those fingerprints and the Professor's report on the chisel."</p>

<p>Markham was sorely perplexed. His belief in Skeel's guilt had, I
knew, been undermined in some measure by Vance's theory that the
crime was the carefully premeditated act of a shrewd and educated
man. But now he seemed to swing irresolutely back to Heath's point
of view.</p>

<p>"I'll admit," he said, "that Lindquist and Cleaver and Mannix
don't inspire one with a belief in their innocence. But since
they're all tarred with the same stick, the force of suspicion
against them is somewhat dispersed. After all, Skeel is the only
logical aspirant for the role of strangler. He's the only one with
a visible motive; and he's the only one against whom there's any
evidence."</p>

<p>Vance sighed wearily. "Yes, yes. Fingerprints&mdash;chisel
marks. You're such a trustin' soul, Markham. Skeel's fingerprints
are found in the apartment; therefore, Skeel strangled the lady. So
beastly simple. Why bother further? A <i>chose
jug&eacute;e</i>&mdash;an adjudicated case. Send Skeel to the
chair, and that's that!...It's effective, y' know, but is it
art?"</p>

<p>"In your critical enthusiasm you understate our case against
Skeel," Markham reminded him testily.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll grant that your case against him is ingenious. It's so
deuced ingenious I just haven't the heart to reject it. But most
popular truth is mere ingenuity&mdash;that's why it's so
wrong-headed. Your theory would appeal strongly to the popular
mind. And yet, y' know, Markham, it isn't true."</p>

<p>The practical Heath was unmoved. He sat stolidly, scowling at
the table. I doubt if he had even heard the exchange of opinions
between Markham and Vance.</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Markham," he said, like one unconsciously voicing
an obscure line of thought, "if we could show how Skeel got in and
out of Odell's apartment, we'd have a better case against him. I
can't figure it out&mdash;it's got me stopped. So, I've been
thinking we oughta get an architect to go over those rooms. The
house is an oldtimer&mdash;God knows when it was originally
built&mdash;and there may be some way of getting into it that we
haven't discovered yet."</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul!" Vance stared at him in satirical wonderment.
"You're becoming downright romantic! Secret passageways, hidden
doors, stairways between the walls. So that's it, is it? Oh, my
word!... Sergeant, beware of the cinema. It has ruined many a good
man. Try grand opera for a while&mdash;it's more borin' but less
corruptin'."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Mr. Vance." Apparently Heath himself did not
relish the architectural idea particularly. "But as long as we
don't know how Skeel got in, it's just as well to make sure of a
few ways he didn't get in."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Sergeant," said Markham. "I'll get an
architect on the job at once." He rang for Swacker and gave the
necessary instructions.</p>

<p>Vance extended his legs and yawned.</p>

<p>"All we need now is a Favorite of the Harem, a few blackamoors
with palm-leaf fans, and some <i>pizzicato</i> music."</p>

<p>"You will joke, Mr. Vance." Heath lit a fresh cigar. "But even
if the architect don't find anything wrong with the apartment,
Skeel's liable to give his hand away 'most any time."</p>

<p>"I'm pinnin' my childish faith on Mannix," said Vance. "I don't
know why I should; but he's not a nice man, and he's suppressing
something. Markham, don't you dare let him go until he tells you
where he was Monday night. And don't forget to hint mysteriously
about the fur model."</p>

<h2>20 - A MIDNIGHT WITNESS</h2>

<p><i>(Friday, September 14; 3:30 P.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>In less than half an hour Mannix arrived. Heath relinquished his
seat to the newcomer and moved to a large chair beneath the
windows. Vance had taken a place at the small table on Markham's
right where he was able to face Mannix obliquely.</p>

<p>It was patent that Mannix did not relish the idea of another
interview. His little eyes shifted quickly about the office,
lingered suspiciously for a moment on Heath, and at last came to
rest on the district attorney. He was more vigilant even than
during his first visit; and his greeting to Markham, while fulsome,
had in it a note of trepidation. Nor was Markham's air calculated
to put him at ease. It was an ominous, indomitable Public
Prosecutor who motioned him to be seated. Mannix laid his hat and
cane on the table and sat down on the edge of his chair, his back
as perpendicular as a flagpole.</p>

<p>"I'm not at all satisfied with what you told me Wednesday, Mr.
Mannix," Markham began, "and I trust you won't necessitate me to
take drastic steps to find out what you know about Miss Odell's
death."</p>

<p>"What I know!" Mannix forced a smile intended to be disarming.
"Mr. Markham&mdash;Mr. Markham!" He seemed oilier than usual as he
spread his hands in hopeless appeal. "If I knew anything, believe
me, I would tell you&mdash;positively I would tell you."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to hear it. Your willingness makes my task
easier. First, then, please tell me where you were at midnight
Monday."</p>

<p>Mannix's eyes slowly contracted until they looked like two tiny
shining disks, but otherwise the man did not move. After what
seemed an interminable pause, he spoke.</p>

<p>"I should tell you where I was Monday? Why should I have to do
that?...Maybe I'm suspected of the murder&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>"You're not suspected now. But your apparent unwillingness to
answer my question is certainly suspicious. Why don't you care to
have me know where you were?"</p>

<p>"I got no reason to keep it from you, y' understand." Mannix
shrugged. "I got nothing to be ashamed of&mdash;absolutely!...I had
a lot of accounts to go over at the office&mdash;winter-season
stocks. I was down at the office until ten o'clock&mdash;maybe
later. Then at half past ten&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do!" Vance's voice cut in tartly. "No need to drag
anyone else into this thing."</p>

<p>He spoke with a curious significance of emphasis, and Mannix
studied him craftily, trying to read what knowledge, if any, lay
behind his words. But he received no enlightenment from Vance's
features. The warning, however, had been enough to halt him.</p>

<p>"You don't want to know where I was at half past ten?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly," said Vance. "We want to know where you were
at midnight. And it won't be necess'ry to mention anyone who saw
you at that time. When you tell us the truth, we'll know it." He
himself had assumed the air of wisdom and mystery that he had
deputed to Markham earlier in the afternoon. Without breaking faith
with Alys La Fosse, he had sowed the seeds of doubt in Mannix's
mind.</p>

<p>Before the man could frame an answer, Vance stood up and leaned
impressively over the district attorney's desk.</p>

<p>"You know a Miss Frisbee. Lives in 71st Street; accurately
speaking&mdash;at number 184; to be more exact&mdash;in the house
where Miss Odell lived; to put it precisely&mdash;in Apartment
Number 2. Miss Frisbee was a former model of yours. Sociable girl:
still charitable to the advances of her erstwhile
employer&mdash;meanin' yourself. When did you see her last, Mr.
Mannix?...Take your time about answering. You may want to think it
over."</p>

<p>Mannix took his time. It was a full minute before he spoke, and
then it was to put another question.</p>

<p>"Haven't I got a right to call on a lady&mdash;-haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Therefore, why should a question about so obviously
correct and irreproachable an episode make you uneasy?"</p>

<p>"Me uneasy?" Mannix, with considerable effort, produced a grin.
"I'm just wondering what you got in your mind, asking me about my
private affairs."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. Miss Odell was murdered at about midnight
Monday. No one came or went through the front door of the house,
and the side door was locked. The only way any one could have
entered her apartment was by way of Apartment 2; and nobody who
knew Miss Odell ever visited Apartment 2 except yourself."</p>

<p>At these words Mannix leaned over the table, grasping the edge
of it with both hands for support. His eyes were wide and his
sensual lips hung open. But it was not fear that one read in his
attitude; it was sheer amazement. He sat for a moment staring at
Vance, stunned and incredulous.</p>

<p>"That's what you think, is it? No one could've got in or out
except by Apartment 2, because the side door was locked?" He gave a
short, vicious laugh. "If that side door didn't happen to be locked
Monday night, where'd I stand then&mdash;huh? Where'd I stand?"</p>

<p>"I rather think you'd stand with us&mdash;with the district
attorney." Vance was watching him like a cat.</p>

<p>"Sure I would!" spat Mannix. "And let me tell you something, my
friend: that's just where I stand&mdash;absolutely!" He swung
heavily about and faced Markham. "I'm a good fellow, y' understand,
but I've kept my mouth shut long enough...<i>That side door wasn't
locked Monday night. And I know who sneaked out of it at five
minutes to twelve</i>!"</p>

<p><i>"&Ccedil;a marche!"</i> murmured Vance, reseating himself and
calmly lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>Markham was too astonished to speak at once; and Heath sat
stock-still, his cigar halfway to his mouth.</p>

<p>At length Markham leaned back and folded his arms.</p>

<p>"I think you'd better tell us the whole story, Mr. Mannix." His
voice held a quality which made the request an imperative.</p>

<p>Mannix, too, settled back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going to tell it&mdash;believe me, I'm going to tell
it. You had the right idea. I spent the evening with Miss Frisbee.
No harm in that, though."</p>

<p>"What time did you go there?"</p>

<p>"After office hours&mdash;half past five, quarter to six. Came
up in the subway, got off at 72d, and walked over."</p>

<p>"And you entered the house through the front door?"</p>

<p>"No. I walked down the alleyway and went in the side
door&mdash;like I generally do. It's nobody's business who I call
on, and what the telephone operator in the front hall don't know
don't hurt him."</p>

<p>"That's all right so far," observed Heath. "The janitor didn't
bolt the side door until after six."</p>

<p>"And did you stay the entire evening, Mr. Mannix?" asked
Markham.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;till just before midnight. Miss Frisbee cooked the
dinner, and I'd brought along a bottle of wine. Social little
party&mdash;just the two of us. And I didn't go outside the
apartment, understand, until five minutes to twelve. You can get
the lady down here and ask her. I'll call her up now and tell her
to explain the exact situation about Monday night. I'm not asking
you to take my word for it&mdash;positively not."</p>

<p>Markham made a gesture dismissing the suggestion.</p>

<p>"What took place at five minutes to twelve?"</p>

<p>Mannix hesitated, as if loath to come to the point.</p>

<p>"I'm a good fellow, y' understand. And a friend's a friend.
But&mdash;I ask you&mdash;is that any reason why I should get in
wrong for something I didn't have absolutely nothing to do
with?"</p>

<p>He waited for an answer, but receiving none, continued.</p>

<p>"Sure, I'm right. Anyway, here's what happened. As I said, I was
calling on the lady. But I had another date for later that night;
so a few minutes before midnight I said good-bye and started to go.
Just as I opened the door I saw someone sneaking away from the
Canary's apartment down the little back hall to the side door.
There was a light in the hall, and the door of Apartment 2 faces
that side door. I saw the fellow as plain as I see
you&mdash;positively as plain."</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you got to know, it was Pop Cleaver."</p>

<p>Markham's head jerked slightly.</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Mr. Markham&mdash;nothing at all. I didn't think much
about it, y' understand. I knew Pop was chasing after the Canary,
and I just supposed he'd been calling on her. But I didn't want Pop
to see me&mdash;none of his business where I spend my time. So I
waited quietly till he went out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the side door?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Then I went out the same way. I was going to leave by the
front door, because I knew the side door was always locked at
night. But when I saw Pop go out that way, I said to myself I'd do
the same. No sense giving your business away to a telephone
operator if you haven't got to&mdash;no sense at all. So I went out
the same way I came in. Picked up a taxi on Broadway, and
went&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough!" Again Vance's command cut him short.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right&mdash;all right." Mannix seemed content to end
his statement at this point. "Only, y' understand, I don't want you
to think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We don't."</p>

<p>Markham was puzzled at these interruptions, but made no
comment.</p>

<p>"When you read of Miss Odell's death," he said, "why didn't you
come to the police with this highly important information?"</p>

<p>"I should get mixed up in it!" exclaimed Mannix in surprise. "I
got enough trouble without looking for it&mdash;plenty."</p>

<p>"An exigent course," commented Markham with open disgust. "But
you nevertheless suggested to me, after you knew of the murder,
that Cleaver was being blackmailed by Miss Odell."</p>

<p>"Sure I did. Don't that go to show I wanted to do the right
thing by you&mdash;giving you a valuable tip?"</p>

<p>"Did you see anyone else that night in the halls or
alleyway?"</p>

<p>"Nobody&mdash;absolutely nobody."</p>

<p>"Did you hear anyone in the Odell apartment&mdash;anyone
speaking or moving about, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Didn't hear a thing." Mannix shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p>"And you're certain of the time you saw Cleaver go
out&mdash;five minutes to twelve?"</p>

<p>"Positively. I looked at my watch, and I said to the lady: 'I'm
leaving the same day I came; it won't be tomorrow for five minutes
yet.'"</p>

<p>Markham went over his story point by point, attempting by
various means to make him admit more than he had already told. But
Mannix neither added to his statement nor modified it in any
detail; and after half an hour's cross-examination he was permitted
to go.</p>

<p>"We've found one missing piece of the puzzle, at any rate,"
commented Vance. "I don't see now just how it fits into the
complete pattern, but it's helpful and suggestive. And, I say, how
beautifully my intuition about Mannix was verified, don't y'
know!"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course&mdash;your precious intuition." Markham looked
at him sceptically. "Why did you shut him up twice when he was
trying to tell me something?"</p>

<p><i>"O, tu ne sauras jamais,"</i> recited Vance. "I simply can't
tell you, old dear. Awfully sorry, and all that."</p>

<p>His manner was whimsical, but Markham knew that at such times
Vance was at heart most serious, and he did not press the question.
I could not help wondering if Miss La Fosse realized just how
secure she had been in putting her faith in Vance's integrity.</p>

<p>Heath had been considerably shaken by Mannix's story.</p>

<p>"I don't savvy that side door being unlocked," he complained.
"How the hell did it get bolted again on the inside after Mannix
went out? And who unbolted it after six o'clock?"</p>

<p>"In God's good time, my sergeant, all things will be revealed,"
said Vance.</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;and maybe not. But if we do find out, you can take
it from me that the answer'll be Skeel. He's the bird we gotta get
the goods on. Cleaver is no expert jimmy artist; and neither is
Mannix."</p>

<p>"Just the same, there was a very capable technician on hand that
night, and it wasn't your friend the Dude, though he was probably
the Donatello who sculptured open the jewel case."</p>

<p>"A pair of 'em, was there? That's your theory, is it, Mr. Vance?
You said that once before; and I'm not saying you're wrong. But if
we can hang any part of it on Skeel, we'll make him come across as
to who his pal was."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a pal, Sergeant. It was more likely a stranger."</p>

<p>Markham sat glowering into space.</p>

<p>"I don't at all like the Cleaver end of this affair," he said.
"There's been something damned wrong about him ever since
Monday."</p>

<p>"And I say," put in Vance, "doesn't the gentleman's false alibi
take on a certain shady significance now, what? You apprehend, I
trust, why I restrained you from questioning him about it at the
club yesterday. I rather fancied that if you could get Mannix to
pour out his heart to you, you'd be in a stronger position to draw
a few admissions from Cleaver. And behold? Again the triumph of
intuition! With what you now know about him, you can chivvy him
most unconscionably&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"And that's precisely what I'm going to do." Markham rang for
Swacker. "Get hold of Charles Cleaver," he ordered irritably.
"Phone him at the Stuyvesant Club and also his home&mdash;he lives
round the corner from the club in West 27th Street. And tell him I
want him to be here in half an hour, or I'll send a couple of
detectives to bring him in handcuffs."</p>

<p>For five minutes Markham stood before the window, smoking
agitatedly, while Vance, with a smile of amusement, busied himself
with <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i> Heath got himself a drink of
water, and took a turn up and down the room. Presently Swacker
reentered.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Chief, but there's nothing doing. Cleaver's gone into
the country somewhere. Won't be back till late tonight."</p>

<p>"Hell!...All right&mdash;that'll do." Markham turned to Heath.
"You have Cleaver rounded up tonight, Sergeant, and bring him in
here tomorrow morning at nine."</p>

<p>"He'll be here, sir!" Heath paused in his pacing and faced
Markham. "I've been thinking, sir; and there's one thing that keeps
coming up in my mind, so to speak. You remember that black document
box that was setting on the living room table? It was empty; and
what a woman generally keeps in that kind of a box is letters and
things like that. Well, now, here's what's been bothering me: that
box wasn't jimmied open&mdash;it was unlocked with a key. And,
anyway, a professional crook don't take letters and documents...You
see what I mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant of mine!" exclaimed Vance. "I abase myself before you!
I sit at your feet!...The document box&mdash;the tidily opened,
empty document box! Of course. Skeel didn't open it&mdash;never in
this world! That was the other chap's handiwork."</p>

<p>"What was in your mind about that box, Sergeant?" asked
Markham.</p>

<p>"Just this, sir. As Mr. Vance has insisted right along, there
mighta been someone besides Skeel in that apartment during the
night. And you told me that Cleaver admitted to you he'd paid Odell
a lot of money last June to get back his letters. But suppose he
never paid that money; suppose he went there Monday night and took
those letters. Wouldn't he have told you just the story he did
about buying 'em back? Maybe that's how Mannix happened to see him
there."</p>

<p>"That's not unreasonable," Markham acknowledged. "But where does
it lead us?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if Cleaver did take 'em Monday night, he mighta held
on to 'em. And if any of those letters were dated later than last
June, when he says he bought 'em back, then we'd have the goods on
him."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"As I say, sir, I've been thinking...Now, Cleaver is outa town
today; and if we could get hold of those letters..."</p>

<p>"It might prove helpful, of course," said Markham coolly,
looking the sergeant straight in the eye. "But such a thing is
quite out of the question."</p>

<p>"Still and all," mumbled Heath. "Cleaver's been pulling a lot of
raw stuff on you, sir."</p>

<h2>21 - A CONTRADICTION IN DATES</h2>

<p><i>(Saturday, September 15; 9 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>The next morning Markham and Vance and I breakfasted together at
the Prince George, and arrived at the district attorney's office a
few minutes past nine. Heath, with Cleaver in tow, was waiting in
the reception room.</p>

<p>To judge by Cleaver's manner as he entered, the sergeant had
been none too considerate of him. He strode belligerently to the
district attorney's desk and fixed a cold, resentful eye on
Markham.</p>

<p>"Am I, by any chance, under arrest?" he demanded softly, but it
was the rasping, suppressed softness of wrathful indignation.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Markham curtly. "But if you were, you'd have
only yourself to blame. Sit down."</p>

<p>Cleaver hesitated, and took the nearest chair.</p>

<p>"Why was I routed out of bed at seven thirty by this detective
of yours"&mdash;he jerked his thumb toward Heath&mdash;"and
threatened with patrol wagons and warrants because I objected to
such high-handed and illegal methods?"</p>

<p>"You were merely threatened with legal procedure if you refused
to accept my invitation voluntarily. This is my short day at the
office; and there was some explaining I wanted from you without
delay."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I'll explain anything to you under these
conditions!" For all his nerveless poise, Cleaver was finding it
difficult to control himself. "I'm no pickpocket that you can drag
in here when it suits your convenience and put through a third
degree."</p>

<p>"That's eminently satisfactory to me." Markham spoke ominously.
"But since you refuse to do your explaining as a free citizen, I
have no other course than to alter your present status." He turned
to Heath. "Sergeant, go across the hall and have Ben swear out a
warrant for Charles Cleaver. Then lock this gentleman up."</p>

<p>Cleaver gave a start and caught his breath sibilantly. "On what
charge?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The murder of Margaret Odell."</p>

<p>The man sprang to his feet. The color had gone from his face,
and the muscles of his jowls worked spasmodically. "Wait! You're
giving me a raw deal. And you'll lose out, too. You couldn't make
that charge stick in a thousand years."</p>

<p>"Maybe not. But if you don't want to talk here, I'll make you
talk in court."</p>

<p>"I'll talk here," Cleaver sat down again. "What do you want to
know?"</p>

<p>Markham took out a cigar and lit it with deliberation. "First:
why did you tell me you were in Boonton Monday night?"</p>

<p>Cleaver apparently had expected the question. "When I read of
the Canary's death, I wanted an alibi; and my brother had just
given me the summons he'd been handed in Boonton. It was a
ready-made alibi right in my hand. So I used it."</p>

<p>"Why did you need an alibi?"</p>

<p>"I didn't need it; but I thought it might save me trouble.
People knew I'd been running round with the Odell girl; and some of
them knew she'd been blackmailing me&mdash;I'd told 'em, like a
damn fool. I told Mannix, for instance. We'd both been stung."</p>

<p>"Is that your only reason for concocting this alibi?" Markham
was watching him sharply.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it reason enough? Blackmail would have constituted a
motive, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"It takes more than a motive to arouse unpleasant
suspicion."</p>

<p>"Maybe so. Only I didn't want to be drawn into it. You can't
blame me for trying to keep clear of it."</p>

<p>Markham leaned over with a threatening smile. "The fact that
Miss Odell had blackmailed you wasn't your only reason for lying
about the summons. It wasn't even your main reason."</p>

<p>Cleaver's eyes narrowed, but otherwise he was like a graven
image. "You evidently know more about it than I do." He managed to
make his words sound casual.</p>

<p>"Not more, Mr. Cleaver," Markham corrected him, "but nearly as
much. Where were you between eleven o'clock and midnight
Monday?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's one of the things you know."</p>

<p>"You're right. You were in Miss Odell's apartment."</p>

<p>Cleaver sneered, but he did not succeed in disguising the shock
that Markham's accusation caused him.</p>

<p>"If that's what you think, then it happens you don't know, after
all. I haven't put foot in her apartment for two weeks."</p>

<p>"I have the testimony of reliable witnesses to the
contrary."</p>

<p>"Witnesses!" The word seemed to force itself from Cleaver's
compressed lips.</p>

<p>Markham nodded. "You were seen coming out of Miss Odell's
apartment and leaving the house by the side door at five minutes to
twelve on Monday night."</p>

<p>Cleaver's jaw sagged slightly, and his labored breathing was
quite audible.</p>

<p>"And between half past eleven and twelve o'clock," pursued
Markham's relentless voice, "Miss Odell was strangled and robbed.
What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>For a long time there was tense silence. Then Cleaver spoke.</p>

<p>"I've got to think this thing out."</p>

<p>Markham waited patiently. After several minutes Cleaver drew
himself together and squared his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you what I did that night, and you can take
it or leave it." Again he was the cold, self-contained gambler. "I
don't care how many witnesses you've got; it's the only story
you'll ever get out of me. I should have told you in the first
place, but I didn't see any sense of stepping into hot water if I
wasn't pushed in. You might have believed me last Tuesday, but now
you've got something in your head, and you want to make an arrest
to shut up the newspapers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell your story," ordered Markham. "If it's straight, you
needn't worry about the newspapers."</p>

<p>Cleaver knew in his heart that this was true. No one, not even
his bitterest political enemies, had ever accused Markham of buying
kudos with any act of injustice, however small.</p>

<p>"There's not much to tell, as a matter of fact," the man began.
"I went to Miss Odell's house a little before midnight, but I
didn't enter her apartment; I didn't even ring her bell."</p>

<p>"Is that your customary way of paying visits?"</p>

<p>"Sounds fishy, doesn't it? But it's the truth, nevertheless. I
intended to see her&mdash;that is, I wanted to&mdash;but when I
reached her door, something made me change my mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a moment. How did you enter the house?"</p>

<p>"By the side door, the one off the alleyway. I always used it
when it was open. Miss Odell requested me to, so that the telephone
operator wouldn't see me coming in so often."</p>

<p>"And the door was unlocked at that time Monday night?"</p>

<p>"How else could I have got in by it? A key wouldn't have done me
any good, even if I'd had one, for the door locks by a bolt on the
inside. I'll say this, though: that's the first time I ever
remember finding the door unlocked at night."</p>

<p>"All right. You went in the side entrance. Then what?"</p>

<p>"I walked down the rear hall and listened at the door of Miss
Odell's apartment for a minute. I thought there might be someone
else with her, and I didn't want to ring unless she was
alone..."</p>

<p>"Pardon my interrupting, Mr. Cleaver," interposed Vance. "But
what made you think someone else was there?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>"Was it," prompted Vance, "because you had telephoned to Miss
Odell a little while before, and had been answered by a man's
voice?"</p>

<p>Cleaver nodded slowly. "I can't see any particular point in
denying it...Yes, that's the reason."</p>

<p>"What did this man say to you?"</p>

<p>"Damn little. He said 'Hello,' and when I asked to speak to Miss
Odell, he informed me she wasn't in, and hung up."</p>

<p>Vance addressed himself to Markham. "That, I think, explains
Jessup's report of the brief phone call to the Odell apartment at
twenty minutes to twelve."</p>

<p>"Probably." Markham spoke without interest. He was intent on
Cleaver's account of what happened later and he took up the
interrogation at the point where Vance had interrupted.</p>

<p>"You say you listened at the apartment door. What caused you to
refrain from ringing?"</p>

<p>"I heard a man's voice inside."</p>

<p>Markham straightened up.</p>

<p>"A man's voice? You're sure?"</p>

<p>"That's what I said." Cleaver was matter of fact about it. "A
man's voice. Otherwise I'd have rung the bell."</p>

<p>"Could you identify the voice?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. It was very indistinct; and it sounded a little hoarse.
It wasn't anyone's voice I was familiar with; but I'd be inclined
to say it was the same one that answered me over the phone."</p>

<p>"Could you make out anything that was said?"</p>

<p>Cleaver frowned and looked past Markham through the open window.
"I know what the words sounded like," he said slowly. "I didn't
think anything of them at the time. But after reading the papers
the next day, those words came back to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What were the words?" Markham cut in impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well, as near as I could make out, they were: 'Oh, my God! Oh,
my God!'&mdash;repeated two or three times."</p>

<p>This statement seemed to bring a sense of horror into the dreary
old office&mdash;a horror all the more potent because of the
casual, phlegmatic way in which Cleaver repeated that cry of
anguish. After a brief pause Markham asked, "When you heard this
man's voice, what did you do?"</p>

<p>"I walked softly back down the rear hall and went out again
through the side door. Then I went home."</p>

<p>A short silence ensued. Cleaver's testimony had been in the
nature of a surprise; but it fitted perfectly with Mannix's
statement.</p>

<p>Presently Vance lifted himself out of the depths of his chair.
"I say, Mr. Cleaver, what were you doing between twenty minutes to
twelve, when you phoned Miss Odell, and five minutes to twelve,
when you entered the side door of her apartment house?"</p>

<p>"I was riding uptown in the subway from 23d Street," came the
answer after a short pause.</p>

<p>"Strange&mdash;very strange." Vance inspected the tip of his
cigarette. "Then you couldn't possibly have phoned to anyone during
that fifteen minutes&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered Alys La Fosse's statement that Cleaver had
telephoned to her on Monday night at ten minutes to twelve. Vance,
by his question, had, without revealing his own knowledge, created
a state of uncertainty in the other's mind. Afraid to commit
himself too emphatically, Cleaver resorted to an evasion.</p>

<p>"It's possible, is it not, that I could have phoned someone
after leaving the subway at 72d Street and before I walked the
block to Miss Odell's house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," murmured Vance. "Still, looking at it
mathematically, if you phoned Miss Odell at twenty minutes to
twelve, and then entered the subway, rode to 72d Street, walked a
block to 71st, went into the building, listened at her door, and
departed at five minutes to twelve&mdash;making the total time
consumed only fifteen minutes&mdash;you'd scarcely have sufficient
leeway to stop en route and phone to anyone. However, I sha'n't
press the point. But I'd really like to know what you did between
eleven o'clock and twenty minutes to twelve, when you phoned to
Miss Odell."</p>

<p>Cleaver studied Vance intently for a moment. "To tell you the
truth, I was upset that night. I knew Miss Odell was out with
another man&mdash;she'd broken an appointment with me&mdash;and I
walked the streets for an hour or more, fuming and fretting."</p>

<p>"Walked the streets?" Vance frowned.</p>

<p>"That's what I said." Cleaver spoke with animus. Then, turning,
he gave Markham a long, calculating look. "You remember I once
suggested to you that you might learn something from a Doctor
Lindquist... Did you ever get after him?"</p>

<p>Before Markham could answer, Vance broke in. "Ah! That's
it!&mdash;Doctor Lindquist! Well, well&mdash;of course!...So, Mr.
Cleaver, you were walking the streets? The <i>streets,</i> mind
you! Precisely! You state the fact, and I echo the word
<i>streets</i><i>.</i> And you&mdash;apparently out of a clear
sky&mdash;ask about Doctor Lindquist. Why Doctor Lindquist? No one
has mentioned him. But that word <i>streets</i>&mdash;that's the
connection. The streets and Doctor Lindquist are one&mdash;same as
Paris and springtime are one. Neat, very neat... And now I've got
another piece to the puzzle."</p>

<p>Markham and Heath looked at him as if he had suddenly gone mad.
He calmly selected a R&eacute;gie from his case and proceeded to
light it. Then he smiled beguilingly at Cleaver.</p>

<p>"The time has come, my dear sir, for you to tell us when and
where you met Doctor Lindquist while roaming the streets Monday
night. If you don't, 'pon my word, I'll come pretty close to doing
it for you."</p>

<p>A full minute passed before Cleaver spoke; and during that time
his cold, staring eyes never moved from the district attorney's
face.</p>

<p>"I've already told most of the story; so here's the rest." He
gave a soft mirthless laugh. "I went to Miss Odell's house a little
before half past eleven&mdash;thought she might be home by that
time. There I ran into Doctor Lindquist standing in the entrance to
the alleyway. He spoke to me and told me someone was with Miss
Odell in her apartment. Then I walked round the corner to the
Ansonia Hotel. After ten minutes or so I telephoned Miss Odell,
and, as I said, a man answered. I waited another ten minutes and
phoned a friend of Miss Odell's, hoping to arrange a party; but,
failing, I walked back to the house. The doctor had disappeared,
and I went down the alleyway and in the side door. After listening
a minute, as I told you, and hearing a man's voice, I came away and
went home...That's everything."</p>

<p>At that moment Swacker came in and whispered something to Heath.
The sergeant rose with alacrity and followed the secretary out of
the room. Almost at once he returned, bearing a bulging manila
folder. Handing it to Markham, he said something in a low voice
inaudible to the rest of us. Markham appeared both astonished and
displeased. Waving the sergeant back to his seat, he turned to
Cleaver.</p>

<p>"I'll have to ask you to wait in the reception room for a few
minutes. Another urgent matter has just arisen."</p>

<p>Cleaver went out without a word, and Markham opened the folder.
"I don't like this sort of thing, Sergeant. I told you so yesterday
when you suggested it."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir." Heath, I felt, was not as contrite as his
tone indicated. "But if those letters and things are all right, and
Cleaver hasn't been lying to us about 'em, I'll have my man put 'em
back so's no one'll ever know they were taken. And if they do make
Cleaver out a liar, then we've got a good excuse for grabbing
'em."</p>

<p>Markham did not argue the point. With a gesture of distaste he
began running through the letters, looking particularly at the
dates. Two photographs he put back after a cursory glance; and one
piece of paper, which appeared to contain a pen-and-ink sketch of
some kind, he tore up with disgust and threw into the wastebasket.
Three letters, I noticed, he placed to one side. After five
minutes' inspection of the others, he returned them to the folder.
Then he nodded to Heath.</p>

<p>"Bring Cleaver back." He rose and, turning, gazed out of the
window.</p>

<p>As soon as Cleaver was again seated before the desk, Markham
said, without looking round, "You told me it was last June that you
bought your letters back from Miss Odell. Do you recall the
date?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," said Cleaver easily. "It was early in the month,
though&mdash;during the first week, I think."</p>

<p>Markham now spun about and pointed to the three letters he had
segregated.</p>

<p>"How, then, do you happen to have in your possession
compromising letters which you wrote to Miss Odell from the
Adirondacks late in July?"</p>

<p>Cleaver's self-control was perfect. After a moment's stoical
silence, he merely said in a mild, quiet voice, "You of course came
by those letters legally."</p>

<p>Markham was stung, but he was also exasperated by the other's
persistent deceptions.</p>

<p>"I regret to confess," he said, "that they were taken from your
apartment&mdash;though, I assure you, it was against my
instructions. But since they have come unexpectedly into my
possession, the wisest thing you can do is to explain them. There
was an empty document box in Miss Odell's apartment the morning her
body was found, and, from all appearances, it had been opened
Monday night."</p>

<p>"I see." Cleaver laughed harshly. "Very well. The fact
is&mdash;though I frankly don't expect you to believe me&mdash;I
didn't pay my blackmail to Miss Odell until the middle of August,
about three weeks ago. That's when all my letters were returned. I
told you it was June in order to set back the date as far as
possible. The older the affair was, I figured, the less likelihood
there'd be of your suspecting me."</p>

<p>Markham stood fingering the letters undecidedly. It was Vance
who put an end to his irresolution.</p>

<p>"I rather think, don't y' know," he said, "that you'd be safe in
accepting Mr. Cleaver's explanation and returning his
billets-doux."</p>

<p>Markham, after a momentary hesitation, picked up the manila
folder and, replacing the three letters, handed it to Cleaver.</p>

<p>"I wish you to understand that I did not sanction the
appropriating of this correspondence. You'd better take it home and
destroy it&mdash;I won't detain you any longer now. But please
arrange to remain where I can reach you if necessary."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to run away," said Cleaver; and Heath directed
him to the elevator.</p>

<h2>22 - A TELEPHONE CALL</h2>

<p><i>(Saturday, September 15; 10 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Heath returned to the office, shaking his head hopelessly.
"There musta been a regular wake at Odell's Monday night."</p>

<p>"Quite," agreed Vance. "A midnight conclave of the lady's
admirers. Mannix was there, unquestionably; and he saw Cleaver; and
Cleaver saw Lindquist; and Lindquist saw Spotswoode&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Humph! But nobody saw Skeel."</p>

<p>"The trouble is," said Markham, "we don't know how much of
Cleaver's story is true. And, by the way, Vance, do you believe he
really bought his letters back in August?"</p>

<p>"If only we knew! Dashed confusin', ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Anyway," argued Heath, "Cleaver's statement about phoning Odell
at twenty minutes to twelve, and a man answering, is verified by
Jessup's testimony. And I guess Cleaver saw Lindquist all right
that night, for it was him who first tipped us off about the doc.
He took a chance doing it, because the doc was liable to tell us he
saw Cleaver."</p>

<p>"But if Cleaver had an allurin' alibi," said Vance, "he could
simply have said the doctor was lying. However, whether you accept
Cleaver's absorbin' legend or not, you can take my word for it
there was a visitor, other than Skeel, in the Odell apartment that
night."</p>

<p>"That's all right, too," conceded Heath reluctantly. "But, even
so, this other fellow is only valuable to us as a possible source
of evidence against Skeel."</p>

<p>"That may be true, Sergeant." Markham frowned perplexedly.
"Only, I'd like to know how that side door was unbolted and then
rebolted on the inside. We know now that it was open around
midnight, and that Mannix and Cleaver both used it."</p>

<p>"You worry so over trifles," said Vance negligently. "The door
problem will solve itself once we discover who was keeping company
with Skeel in the Canary's gilded cage."</p>

<p>"I should say it boils down to Mannix, Cleaver, and Lindquist.
They were the only three at all likely to be present; and if we
accept Cleaver's story in its essentials, each of them had an
opportunity of getting into the apartment between half past eleven
and midnight."</p>

<p>"True. But you have only Cleaver's word that Lindquist was in
the neighborhood. And that evidence, uncorroborated, can't be
accepted as the lily-white truth."</p>

<p>Heath stirred suddenly and looked at the clock. "Say, what about
that nurse you wanted at eleven o'clock?"</p>

<p>"I've been worrying horribly about her for an hour." Vance
appeared actually troubled. "Really, y' know, I haven't the
slightest desire to meet the lady. I'm hoping for a revelation,
don't y' know. Let's wait for the doctor until half past ten,
Sergeant."</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when Swacker informed Markham
that Doctor Lindquist had arrived on a mission of great urgency. It
was an amusing situation. Markham laughed outright, while Heath
stared at Vance with uncomprehending astonishment.</p>

<p>"It's not necromancy, Sergeant," smiled Vance. "The doctor
realized yesterday that we were about to catch him in a falsehood;
so he decided to forestall us by explaining personally. Simple,
what?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Heath's look of wonderment disappeared.</p>

<p>As Doctor Lindquist entered the room I noted that his habitual
urbanity had deserted him. His air was at once apologetic and
apprehensive. That he was laboring under some great strain was
evident.</p>

<p>"I've come, sir," he announced, taking the chair Markham
indicated, "to tell you the truth about Monday night."</p>

<p>"The truth is always welcome, Doctor," said Markham
encouragingly.</p>

<p>Doctor Lindquist bowed agreement.</p>

<p>"I deeply regret that I did not follow that course at our first
interview. But at that time I had not weighed the matter
sufficiently; and, having once committed myself to a false
statement, I felt I had no option but to abide by it. However,
after more mature consideration, I have come to the conclusion that
frankness is the wiser course. The fact is, sir, I was not with
Mrs. Breedon Monday night between the hours I mentioned. I remained
at home until about half past ten. Then I went to Miss Odell's
house, arriving a little before eleven. I stood outside in the
street until half past eleven; then I returned home."</p>

<p>"Such a bare statement needs considerable amplification."</p>

<p>"I realize it, sir; and I am prepared to amplify it." Doctor
Lindquist hesitated, and a strained look came into his white face.
His hands were tightly clenched. "I had learned that Miss Odell was
going to dinner and the theater with a man named Spotswoode; and
the thought of it began to prey on my mind. It was Spotswoode to
whom I owed the alienation of Miss Odell's affections; and it was
his interference that had driven me to my threat against the young
woman. As I sat at home that night, letting my mind dwell morbidly
on the situation, I was seized by the impulse to carry out that
threat. Why not, I asked myself, end the intolerable situation at
once? And why not include Spotswoode in the debacle?..."</p>

<p>As he talked he became more and more agitated. The nerves about
his eyes had begun to twitch, and his shoulders jerked like those
of a man attempting vainly to control a chill.</p>

<p>"Remember, sir, I was suffering agonies, and my hatred of
Spotswoode seemed to cloud my reason. Scarcely realizing what I was
doing, and yet operating under an irresistible determination, I put
my automatic in my pocket and hurried out of the house. I thought
Miss Odell and Spotswoode would be returning from the theater soon,
and I intended to force my way into the apartment and perform the
act I had planned...From across the street I saw them enter the
house&mdash;it was about eleven then&mdash;but, when I came face to
face with the actuality, I hesitated. I delayed my revenge;
I&mdash;I played with the idea, getting a kind of insane
satisfaction out of it&mdash;knowing they were now at my
mercy..."</p>

<p>His hands were shaking as with a coarse tremor; and the
twitching about his eyes had increased.</p>

<p>"For half an hour I waited, gloating. Then, as I was about to go
in and have it over with, a man named Cleaver came along and saw
me. He stopped and spoke. I thought he might be going to call on
Miss Odell, so I told him she already had a visitor. He then went
on toward Broadway, and while I was waiting for him to turn the
corner, Spotswoode came out of the house and jumped into a taxicab
that had just driven up...My plan had been thwarted&mdash;I had
waited too long. Suddenly I seemed to awake as from some terrible
nightmare. I was almost in a state of collapse, but I managed to
get home...That's what happened&mdash;so help me God!"</p>

<p>He sank back weakly in his chair. The suppressed nervous
excitement that had fired him while he spoke had died out, and he
appeared listless and indifferent. He sat several minutes breathing
stertorously, and twice he passed his hand vaguely across his
forehead. He was in no condition to be questioned, and finally
Markham sent for Tracy and gave orders that he was to be taken to
his home.</p>

<p>"Temporary exhaustion from hysteria," commented Vance
indifferently. "All these paranoia lads are hyperneurasthenic.
He'll be in a psychopathic ward in another year."</p>

<p>"That's as may be, Mr. Vance," said Heath, with an impatience
that repudiated all enthusiasm for the subject of abnormal
psychology. "What interests me just now is the way all these
fellows' stories hang together."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Markham. "There is undeniably a groundwork of
truth in their statements."</p>

<p>"But please observe," Vance pointed out, "that their stories do
not eliminate any one of them as a possible culprit. Their tales,
as you say, synchronize perfectly; and yet, despite all that neat
coordination, any one of the three could have got into the Odell
apartment that night. For instance: Mannix could have entered from
Apartment 2 before Cleaver came along and listened; and he could
have seen Cleaver going away when he himself was leaving the Odell
apartment. Cleaver could have spoken to the doctor at half past
eleven, walked to the Ansonia, returned a little before twelve,
gone into the lady's apartment, and come out just as Mannix opened
Miss Frisbee's door. Again, the excitable doctor may have gone in
after Spotswoode came out at half past eleven, stayed twenty
minutes or so, and departed before Cleaver returned from the
Ansonia...No; the fact that their stories dovetail doesn't in the
least tend to exculpate any one of them."</p>

<p>"And," supplemented Markham, "that cry of 'Oh, my God!' might
have been made by either Mannix or Lindquist&mdash;provided Cleaver
really heard it."</p>

<p>"He heard it unquestionably," said Vance. "Someone in the
apartment was invoking the Deity around midnight. Cleaver hasn't
sufficient sense of the dramatic to fabricate such a thrillin'
<i>bonne-bouche."</i></p>

<p>"But if Cleaver actually heard that voice," protested Markham,
"then, he is automatically eliminated as a suspect."</p>

<p>"Not at all, old dear. He may have heard it after he had come
out of the apartment, and realized then, for the first time, that
someone had been hidden in the place during his visit."</p>

<p>"Your man in the clothes closet, I presume you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of course...You know, Markham, it might have been the
horrified Skeel, emerging from his hiding place upon a scene of
tragic wreckage, who let out that evangelical invocation."</p>

<p>"Except," commented Markham, with sarcasm, "Skeel doesn't
impress me as particularly religious."</p>

<p>"Oh, that?" Vance shrugged. "A point in substantiation.
Irreligious persons call on God much more than Christians. The only
true and consistent theologians, don't y' know, are the
atheists."</p>

<p>Heath, who had been sitting in gloomy meditation, took his cigar
from his mouth and heaved a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes," he rumbled, "I'm willing to admit somebody besides Skeel
got into Odell's apartment, and that the Dude hid in the clothes
closet. But, if that's so, then, this other fellow didn't see
Skeel; and it's not going to do us a whole lot of good even if we
identify him."</p>

<p>"Don't fret on that point, Sergeant," Vance counselled him
cheerfully. "When you've identified this other mysterious visitor,
you'll be positively amazed how black care will desert you. You'll
rubricate the hour you find him. You'll leap gladsomely in the air.
You'll sing a roundelay."</p>

<p>"The hell I will!" said Heath.</p>

<p>Swacker came in with a typewritten memorandum and put it on the
district attorney's desk. "The architect just phoned in this
report."</p>

<p>Markham glanced it over; it was very brief. "No help here," he
said. "Walls solid. No waste space. No hidden entrances."</p>

<p>"Too bad, Sergeant," sighed Vance. "You'll have to drop the
cinema idea...Sad."</p>

<p>Heath grunted and looked disconsolate. "Even without no other
way of getting in or out except that side door," he said to
Markham, "couldn't we get an indictment against Skeel, now that we
know the door was unlocked Monday night?"</p>

<p>"We might, Sergeant. But our chief snag would be to show how it
was originally unlocked and then rebolted after Skeel left. And Abe
Rubin would concentrate on that point. No, we'd better wait awhile
and see what develops."</p>

<p>Something "developed" at once. Swacker entered and informed the
sergeant that Snitkin wanted to see him immediately.</p>

<p>Snitkin came in, visibly agitated, accompanied by a wizened,
shabbily dressed little man of about sixty, who appeared awed and
terrified. In the detective's hand was a small parcel wrapped in
newspaper, which he laid on the district attorney's desk with an
air of triumph.</p>

<p>"The Canary's jewelry," he announced. "I've checked it up from
the list the maid gave me, and it's all there."</p>

<p>Heath sprang forward, but Markham was already untying the
package with nervous fingers. When the paper had been opened, there
lay before us a small heap of dazzling trinkets&mdash;several rings
of exquisite workmanship, three magnificent bracelets, a sparkling
sunburst, and a delicately wrought lorgnette. The stones were all
large and of unconventional cut.</p>

<p>Markham looked up from them inquisitively, and Snitkin, not
waiting for the inevitable question, explained.</p>

<p>"This man Potts found 'em. He's a street cleaner, and he says
they were in one of the D. S. C. cans at 23d Street near the
Flatiron Building. He found 'em yesterday afternoon, so he says,
and took 'em home. Then he got scared and brought 'em to Police
Headquarters this morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Potts, the "white-wing," was trembling visibly.</p>

<p>"Thass right, sir&mdash;thass right," he assured Markham, with
frightened eagerness. "I allus look into any bundles I find. I
didn't mean no harm takin' 'em home, sir. I wasn't gonna keep 'em.
I laid awake worryin' all night, an' this mornin', as soon as I got
a chance, I took 'em to the p'lice." He shook so violently I was
afraid he was going to break down completely.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Potts," Markham told him in a kindly voice.
Then to Snitkin: "Let the man go&mdash;only get his full name and
address."</p>

<p>Vance had been studying the newspaper in which the jewels had
been wrapped.</p>

<p>"I say, my man," he asked, "is this the original paper you found
them in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;the same. I ain't touched nothin'."</p>

<p>"Right-o."</p>

<p>Mr. Potts, greatly relieved, shambled out, followed by
Snitkin.</p>

<p>"The Flatiron Building is directly across Madison Square from
the Stuyvesant Club," observed Markham, frowning.</p>

<p>"So it is." Vance then pointed to the left-hand margin of the
newspaper that held the jewels. "And you'll notice that this
<i>Herald</i> of yesterday has three punctures evidently made by
the pins of a wooden holder such as is generally used in a club's
reading room."</p>

<p>"You got a good eye, Mr. Vance." Heath nodded, inspecting the
newspaper.</p>

<p>"I'll see about this." Markham viciously pressed a button. "They
keep their papers on file for a week at the Stuyvesant Club."</p>

<p>When Swacker appeared, he asked that the club's steward be got
immediately on the telephone. After a short delay, the connection
was made. At the end of five minutes' conversation Markham hung up
the receiver and gave Heath a baffled look.</p>

<p>"The club takes two <i>Heralds.</i> Both of yesterday's copies
are there, on the rack."</p>

<p>"Didn't Cleaver once tell us he read nothing but <i>The
Herald</i>&mdash;that and some racing sheet at night?" Vance put
the question offhandedly.</p>

<p>"I believe he did." Markham considered the suggestion. "Still,
both the club <i>Heralds</i> are accounted for." He turned to
Heath. "When you were checking up on Mannix, did you find out what
clubs he belonged to?"</p>

<p>"Sure." The sergeant took out his notebook and riffled the pages
for a minute or two. "He's a member of the Furriers' and the
Cosmopolis."</p>

<p>Markham pushed the telephone toward him.</p>

<p>"See what you can find out."</p>

<p>Heath was fifteen minutes at the task. "A blank," he announced
finally. "The Furriers' don't use holders, and the Cosmopolis don't
keep any back numbers."</p>

<p>"What about Mr. Skeel's clubs, Sergeant?" asked Vance,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know the finding of that jewelry gums up my theory about
Skeel," said Heath, with surly ill nature. "But what's the good of
rubbing it in? Still, if you think I'm going to give that bird a
clean bill of health just because the Odell swag was found in a
trashcan, you're mighty mistaken. Don't forget we're watching the
Dude pretty close. He may have got leery, and tipped off some pal
he'd cached the jewels with."</p>

<p>"I rather fancy the experienced Skeel would have turned his
booty over to a professional receiver. But even had he passed it on
to a friend, would this friend have been likely to throw it away
because Skeel was worried?"</p>

<p>"Maybe not. But there's some explanation for those jewels being
found, and when we get hold of it, it won't eliminate Skeel."</p>

<p>"No; the explanation won't eliminate Skeel," said Vance;
"but&mdash;my word!&mdash;how it'll change his <i>locus
standi."</i></p>

<p>Heath contemplated him with shrewdly appraising eyes. Something
in Vance's tone had apparently piqued his curiosity and set him to
wondering. Vance had too often been right in his diagnoses of
persons and things for the sergeant to ignore his opinions
wholly.</p>

<p>But before he could answer, Swacker stepped alertly into the
room, his eyes animated.</p>

<p>"Tony Skeel's on the wire, Chief, and wants to speak to
you."</p>

<p>Markham, despite his habitual reserve, gave a start. "Here,
Sergeant," he said quickly. "Take that extension phone on the table
and listen in." He nodded curtly to Swacker, who disappeared to
make the connection. Then he took up the receiver of his own
telephone and spoke to Skeel.</p>

<p>For a minute or so he listened. Then, after a brief argument, he
concurred with some suggestion that had evidently been made; and
the conversation ended.</p>

<p>"Skeel craves an audience, I gather," said Vance. "I've rather
been expecting it, y' know."</p>

<p>"Yes. He's coming here tomorrow at ten."</p>

<p>"And he hinted that he knew who slew the Canary&mdash;eh,
what?"</p>

<p>"That's just what he did say. He promised to tell me the whole
story tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"He's the lad that's in a position to do it," murmured
Vance.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Markham," said Heath, who still sat with his hand on
the telephone, gazing at the instrument with dazed incredulity, "I
don't see why you don't have him brought here today."</p>

<p>"As you heard, Sergeant, Skeel insisted on tomorrow and
threatened to say nothing if I forced the issue. It's just as well
not to antagonize him. We might spoil a good chance of getting some
light on this case if I ordered him brought here and used pressure.
And tomorrow suits me. It'll be quiet around here then. Moreover,
your man's watching Skeel, and he won't get away."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, sir. The Dude's touchy and he can give a
swell imitation of an oyster when he feels like it." The sergeant
spoke with feeling.</p>

<p>"I'll have Swacker here tomorrow to take down his statement,"
Markham went on; "and you'd better put one of your men on the
elevator. The regular operator is off Sundays. Also, plant a man in
the hall outside and put another one in Swacker's office."</p>

<p>Vance stretched himself luxuriously and rose.</p>

<p>"Most considerate of the gentleman to call up at this time,
don't y' know. I had a longing to see the Monets at Durand-Ruel's
this afternoon, and I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to drag
myself away from this fascinatin' case. Now that the apocalypse has
been definitely scheduled for tomorrow, I'll indulge my taste for
Impressionism...<i>&Agrave; demain,</i> Markham. Bye-bye,
Sergeant."</p>

<h2>23 - THE TEN-O'CLOCK APPOINTMENT</h2>

<p><i>(Sunday, September 16; 10 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>A fine drizzle was falling the next morning when we rose; and a
chill&mdash;the first forerunner of winter&mdash;was in the air. We
had breakfast in the library at half past eight, and at nine
o'clock Vance's car, which had been ordered the night before,
called for us. We rode down Fifth Avenue, now almost deserted in
its thick blanket of yellow fog, and called for Markham at his
apartment in West 12th Street. He was waiting for us in front of
the house and stepped quickly into the car with scarcely a word of
greeting. From his anxious, preoccupied look I knew that he was
depending a good deal on what Skeel had to tell him.</p>

<p>We had turned into West Broadway beneath the Elevated tracks
before any of us spoke. Then Markham voiced a doubt which was
plainly an articulation of his troubled ruminations.</p>

<p>"I'm wondering if, after all, this fellow Skeel can have any
important information to give us. His phone call was very strange.
Yet he spoke confidently enough regarding his knowledge. No
dramatics, no request for immunity&mdash;just a plain, assured
statement that he knew who murdered the Odell girl, and had decided
to come clean."</p>

<p>"It's certain he himself didn't strangle the lady," pronounced
Vance. "My theory, as you know, is that he was hiding in the
clothes press when the shady business was being enacted; and all
along I've clung lovingly to the idea that he was <i>au secret</i>
to the entire proceedings. The keyhole of that closet door is on a
direct line with the end of the davenport where the lady was
strangled; and if a rival was operating at the time of his
concealment, it's not unreasonable to assume that he peered
forth&mdash;eh, what? I questioned him on this point, you remember;
and he didn't like it a bit."</p>

<p>"But, in that case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. There are all kinds of erudite objections to my
wild dream. Why didn't he give the alarm? Why didn't he tell us
about it before? Why this? and why that?...I make no claim to
omniscience, y' know; I don't even pretend to have a logical
explanation for the various <i>traits d'union</i> of my vagary. My
theory is only sketched in, as it were. But I'm convinced,
nevertheless, that the modish Tony knows who killed his <i>bona
roba</i> and looted her apartment."</p>

<p>"But of the three persons who possibly could have got into the
Odell apartment that night&mdash;namely, Mannix, Cleaver, and
Lindquist&mdash;Skeel evidently knows only one&mdash;Mannix."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure. And Mannix, it would seem, is the only one of
the trio who knows Skeel...An interestin' point."</p>

<p>Heath met us at the Franklin Street entrance to the Criminal
Courts Building. He, too, was anxious and subdued and he shook
hands with us in a detached manner devoid of his usual
heartiness.</p>

<p>"I've got Snitkin running the elevator," he said, after the
briefest of salutations. "Burke's in the hall upstairs, and Emery
is with him, waiting to be let into Swacker's office."</p>

<p>We entered the deserted and almost silent building and rode up
to the fourth floor. Markham unlocked his office door and we passed
in.</p>

<p>"Guilfoyle, the man who's tailing Skeel," Heath explained, when
we were seated, "is to report by phone to the Homicide Bureau as
soon as the Dude leaves his rooms."</p>

<p>It was now twenty minutes to ten. Five minutes later Swacker
arrived. Taking his stenographic notebook, he stationed himself
just inside of the swinging door of Markham's private sanctum,
where he could hear all that was said without being seen. Markham
lit a cigar, and Heath followed suit. Vance was already smoking
placidly. He was the calmest person in the room, and lay back
languorously in one of the great leather chairs as though immune to
all cares and vicissitudes. But I could tell by the overdeliberate
way he flicked his ashes into the receiver that he, too, was
uneasy.</p>

<p>Five or six minutes passed in complete silence. Then the
sergeant gave a grunt of annoyance. "No, sir," he said, as if
completing some unspoken thought, "I can't get a slant on this
business. The finding of that jewelry, now, all nicely wrapped
up...and then the Dude offering to squeal...There's no sense to
it."</p>

<p>"It's tryin', I know, Sergeant; but it's not altogether
senseless." Vance was gazing lazily at the ceiling. "The chap who
confiscated those baubles didn't have any use for them. He didn't
want them, in fact&mdash;they worried him abominably."</p>

<p>The point was too complex for Heath. The previous day's
developments had shaken the foundation of all his arguments; and he
lapsed again into brooding silence.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock he rose impatiently and, going to the hall door,
looked out. Returning, he compared his watch with the office clock
and began pacing restlessly. Markham was attempting to sort some
papers on his desk, but presently he pushed them aside with an
impatient gesture.</p>

<p>"He ought to be coming along now," he remarked, with an effort
at cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"He'll come," growled Heath, "or he'll get a free ride." And he
continued his pacing.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he turned abruptly and went out into the
hall. We could hear him calling to Snitkin down the elevator shaft,
but when he came back into the office, his expression told us that
as yet there was no news of Skeel.</p>

<p>"I'll call up the bureau," he decided, "and see what Guilfoyle
had to report. At least we'll know then when the Dude left his
house."</p>

<p>But when the sergeant had been connected with police
headquarters, he was informed that Guilfoyle had as yet made no
report.</p>

<p>"That's damn funny," he commented, hanging up the receiver.</p>

<p>It was now twenty minutes past ten. Markham was growing restive.
The tenacity with which the Canary murder case had resisted all his
efforts toward a solution had filled him with discouragement; and
he had hoped, almost desperately, that this morning's interview
with Skeel would clear up the mystery, or at least supply him with
information on which definite action could be taken. Now, with
Skeel late for this all-important appointment, the strain was
becoming tense.</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair nervously and, going to the window,
gazed out into the dark haze of fine rain. When he returned to his
desk his face was set.</p>

<p>"I'll give our friend until half past ten," he said grimly. "If
he isn't here then, Sergeant, you'd better call up the local
station house and have them send a patrol wagon for him."</p>

<p>There was another few minutes of silence. Vance lolled in his
chair with half-closed eyes, but I noticed that, though he still
held his cigarette, he was not smoking. His forehead was puckered
by a frown, and he was very quiet. I knew that some unusual problem
was occupying him. His lethargy had in it a quality of intentness
and concentration.</p>

<p>As I watched him he suddenly sat up straight, his eyes open and
alert. He tossed his dead cigarette into the receiver with a jerky
movement that attested to some inner excitation.</p>

<p>"Oh, my word!" he exclaimed. "It really can't be, y' know! And
yet"&mdash;his face darkened&mdash;"and yet, by Jove, that's
it!...What an ass I've been&mdash;what an unutterable
ass!...Oh!"</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, then stood looking down at the floor like
a man dazed, afraid of his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Markham, I don't like it&mdash;I don't like it at all." He
spoke almost as if he were frightened. "I tell you, there's
something terrible going on&mdash;something uncanny. The thought of
it makes my flesh creep...I must be getting old and sentimental,"
he added, with an effort at lightness; but the look in his eyes
belied his tone. "Why didn't I see this thing yesterday?...But I
let it go on..."</p>

<p>We were all staring at him in amazement. I had never seen him
affected in this way before, and the fact that he was habitually so
cynical and aloof, so adamant to emotion and impervious to outside
influences, gave his words and actions an impelling and impressive
quality.</p>

<p>After a moment he shook himself slightly, as if to throw off the
pall of horror that had descended upon him, and, stepping to
Markham's desk, he leaned over, resting on both hands.</p>

<p>"Don't you see?" he asked. "Skeel's not coming. No use to
wait&mdash;no use of our having come here in the first place. We
have to go to him. He's waiting for us...Come! Get your hat."</p>

<p>Markham had risen, and Vance took him firmly by the arm.</p>

<p>"You needn't argue," he persisted. "You'll have to go to him
sooner or later. You might as well go now, don't y' know. My word!
What a situation!"</p>

<p>He had led Markham, astonished and but mildly protesting, into
the middle of the room, and he now beckoned to Heath with his free
hand.</p>

<p>"You, too, Sergeant. Sorry you had all this trouble. My fault. I
should have foreseen this thing. A devilish shame; but my mind was
on Monets all yesterday afternoon...You know where Skeel
lives?"</p>

<p>Heath nodded mechanically. He had fallen under the spell of
Vance's strange and dynamic importunities.</p>

<p>"Then, don't wait. And, Sergeant! You'd better bring Burke or
Snitkin along. They won't be needed here&mdash;nobody'll be needed
here any more today."</p>

<p>Heath looked inquiringly to Markham for counsel; his
bewilderment had thrown him into a state of mute indecision.
Markham nodded his approval of Vance's suggestions, and, without a
word, slipped into his raincoat. A few minutes later the four of
us, accompanied by Snitkin, had entered Vance's car and were
lurching uptown. Swacker had been sent home; the office had been
locked up; and Burke and Emery had departed for the Homicide Bureau
to await further instructions.</p>

<p>Skeel lived in 35th Street, near the East River, in a dingy, but
once pretentious, house which formerly had been the residence of
some old family of the better class. It now had an air of
dilapidation and decay; there was rubbish in the areaway; and a
large sign announcing rooms for rent was posted in one of the
ground-floor windows.</p>

<p>As we drew up before it Heath sprang to the street and looked
sharply about him. Presently he espied an unkempt man slouching in
the doorway of a grocery store diagonally opposite, and beckoned to
him. The man shambled over furtively.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Guilfoyle," the sergeant told him. "We're
paying the Dude a social visit. What's the trouble? Why didn't you
report?"</p>

<p>Guilfoyle looked surprised. "I was told to phone in when he left
the house, sir. But he ain't left yet. Mallory tailed him home last
night round ten o'clock, and I relieved Mallory at nine this
morning. The Dude's still inside."</p>

<p>"Of course he's still inside, Sergeant," said Vance, a bit
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Where's his room situated, Guilfoyle?" asked Heath.</p>

<p>"Second floor, at the back."</p>

<p>"Right. We're going in. Stand by."</p>

<p>"Look out for him," admonished Guilfoyle. "He's got a gat."</p>

<p>Heath took the lead up the worn steps which led from the
pavement to the little vestibule. Without ringing, he roughly
grasped the doorknob and shook it. The door was unlocked, and we
stepped into the stuffy lower hallway.</p>

<p>A bedraggled woman of about forty, in a disreputable dressing
gown, and with hair hanging in strings over her shoulders, emerged
suddenly from a rear door and came toward us unsteadily, her bleary
eyes focused on us with menacing resentment.</p>

<p>"Say!" she burst out, in a rasping voice. "What do youse mean by
bustin' in like this on a respectable lady?" And she launched forth
upon a stream of profane epithets.</p>

<p>Heath, who was nearest her, placed his large hand over her face,
and gave her a gentle but firm shove backward.</p>

<p>"You keep outa this, Cleopatra!" he advised her, and began to
ascend the stairs.</p>

<p>The second-floor hallway was dimly lighted by a small flickering
gas jet, and at the rear we could distinguish the outlines of a
single door set in the middle of the wall.</p>

<p>"That'll be Mr. Skeel's abode," observed Heath.</p>

<p>He walked up to it and, dropping one hand in his right coat
pocket, turned the knob. But the door was locked. He then knocked
violently upon it and, placing his ear to the jamb, listened.
Snitkin stood directly behind him, his hand also in his pocket. The
rest of us remained a little in the rear.</p>

<p>Heath had knocked a second time when Vance's voice spoke up from
the semidarkness. "I say, Sergeant, you're wasting time with all
that formality."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," came the answer after a moment of what
seemed unbearable silence.</p>

<p>Heath bent down and looked at the lock. Then he took some
instrument from his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole.</p>

<p>"You're right," he repeated. "The key's gone."</p>

<p>He stepped back and, balancing on his toes like a sprinter, sent
his shoulders crashing against the panel directly over the knob.
But the lock held.</p>

<p>"Come on, Snitkin," he ordered.</p>

<p>The two detectives hurled themselves against the door. At the
third onslaught there was a splintering of wood and a tearing of
the lock's bolt through the molding. The door swung drunkenly
inward.</p>

<p>The room was in almost complete darkness. We all hesitated on
the threshold, while Snitkin crossed warily to one of the windows
and sent the shade clattering up. The yellow-gray light filtered
in, and the objects of the room at once took definable form. A
large, old-fashioned bed projected from the wall on the right.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Snitkin, pointing; and something in his voice sent
a shiver over me.</p>

<p>We pressed forward. On the foot of the bed, at the side toward
the door, sprawled the crumpled body of Skeel. Like the Canary, he
had been strangled. His head hung back over the footboard, his face
a hideous distortion. His arms were outstretched, and one leg
trailed over the edge of the mattress, resting on the floor.</p>

<p>"Thuggee," murmured Vance. "Lindquist mentioned it.
Curious!"</p>

<p>Heath stood staring fixedly at the body, his shoulders hunched.
His normal ruddiness of complexion was gone, and he seemed like a
man hypnotized.</p>

<p>"Mother o' God!" he breathed, awestricken. And, with an
involuntary motion, he crossed himself.</p>

<p>Markham was shaken also. He set his jaw rigidly.</p>

<p>"You're right, Vance." His voice was strained and unnatural.
"Something sinister and terrible has been going on here...There's a
fiend loose in this town&mdash;a werewolf."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that, old man." Vance regarded the murdered
Skeel critically. "No, I wouldn't say that. Not a werewolf. Just a
desperate human being. A man of extremes, perhaps, but quite
rational, and logical&mdash;oh, how deuced logical!"</p>

<h2>24 - AN ARREST</h2>

<p><i>(Sunday, P.M., Monday, A.M.; September 16-17)</i>
</p>

<p>The investigation into Skeel's death was pushed with great vigor
by the authorities. Doctor Doremus, the medical examiner, arrived
promptly and declared that the crime had taken place between ten
o'clock and midnight. Immediately Vance insisted that all the men
who were known to have been intimately acquainted with the Odell
girl&mdash;Mannix, Lindquist, Cleaver, and Spotswoode&mdash;be
interviewed at once and made to explain where they were during
these two hours. Markham agreed without hesitation and gave the
order to Heath, who at once put four of his men on the task.</p>

<p>Mallory, the detective who had shadowed Skeel the previous
night, was questioned regarding possible visitors; but inasmuch as
the house where Skeel lived accommodated over twenty roomers, who
were constantly coming and going at all hours, no information could
be gained through that channel. All that Mallory could say
definitely was that Skeel had returned home at about ten o'clock,
and had not come out again. The landlady, sobered and subdued by
the tragedy, repudiated all knowledge of the affair. She explained
that she had been "ill" in her room from dinnertime until we had
disturbed her recuperation the next morning. The front door, it
seemed, was never locked, since her tenants objected to such an
unnecessary inconvenience. The tenants themselves were questioned,
but without result; they were not of a class likely to give
information to the police, even had they possessed any.</p>

<p>The fingerprint experts made a careful examination of the room
but failed to find any marks except Skeel's own. A thorough search
through the murdered man's effects occupied several hours; but
nothing was discovered that gave any hint of the murderer's
identity. A .38 Colt automatic, fully loaded, was found under one
of the pillows on the bed; and eleven hundred dollars, in bills of
large denomination, was taken from a hollow brass curtain rod.
Also, under a loose board in the hall, the missing steel chisel,
with the fissure in the blade, was found. But these items were of
no value in solving the mystery of Skeel's death; and at four
o'clock in the afternoon the room was closed with an emergency
padlock and put under guard.</p>

<p>Markham and Vance and I had remained several hours after our
discovery of the body. Markham had taken immediate charge of the
case and had conducted the interrogation of the tenants. Vance had
watched the routine activities of the police with unwonted
intentness, and had even taken part in the search. He had seemed
particularly interested in Skeel's evening clothes, and had
examined them garment by garment. Heath had looked at him from time
to time, but there had been neither contempt nor amusement in the
sergeant's glances.</p>

<p>At half past two Markham departed, after informing Heath that he
would be at the Stuyvesant Club during the remainder of the day;
and Vance and I went with him. We had a belated luncheon in the
empty grill.</p>

<p>"This Skeel episode rather knocks the foundation from under
everything," Markham said dispiritedly, as our coffee was
served.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;not that," Vance answered. "Rather, let us say
that it has added a new column to the edifice of my giddy
theory."</p>

<p>"Your theory&mdash;yes. It's about all that's left to go on."
Markham sighed. "It has certainly received substantiation this
morning... Remarkable how you called the turn when Skeel failed to
show up."</p>

<p>Again Vance contradicted him.</p>

<p>"You overestimate my little flutter in forensics, Markham dear.
You see, I assumed that the lady's strangler knew of Skeel's offer
to you. That offer was probably a threat of some kind on Skeel's
part; otherwise he wouldn't have set the appointment a day ahead.
He no doubt hoped the victim of his threat would become amenable in
the meantime. And that money hidden in the curtain rod leads me to
think he was blackmailing the Canary's murderer and had been
refused a further donation just before he phoned you yesterday.
That would account, too, for his having kept his guilty knowledge
to himself all this time."</p>

<p>"You may be right. But now we're worse off than ever, for we
haven't even Skeel to guide us."</p>

<p>"At least we've forced our elusive culprit to commit a second
crime to cover up his first, don't y' know. And when we have
learned what the Canary's various amorists were doing last night
between ten and twelve, we may have something suggestive on which
to work. By the bye, when may we expect this thrillin'
information?"</p>

<p>"It depends upon what luck Heath's men have. Tonight sometime,
if everything goes well."</p>

<p>It was, in fact, about half past eight when Heath telephoned the
reports. But here again Markham seemed to have drawn a blank. A
less satisfactory account could scarcely be imagined. Doctor
Lindquist had suffered a "nervous stroke" the preceding afternoon,
and had been taken to the Episcopal Hospital. He was still there
under the care of two eminent physicians whose word it was
impossible to doubt; and it would be a week at least before he
would be able to resume his work. This report was the only definite
one of the four, and it completely exonerated the doctor from any
participation in the previous night's crime.</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence neither Mannix, nor Cleaver, nor
Spotswoode could furnish a satisfactory alibi. All three of them,
according to their statements, had remained at home the night
before. The weather had been inclement; and though Mannix and
Spotswoode admitted to having been out earlier in the evening, they
stated that they had returned home before ten o'clock. Mannix lived
in an apartment hotel, and, as it was Saturday night, the lobby was
crowded, so that no one would have been likely to see him come in.
Cleaver lived in a small private apartment house without a doorman
or hall-boys to observe his movements. Spotswoode was staying at
the Stuyvesant Club, and since his rooms were on the third floor,
he rarely used the elevator. Moreover, there had been a political
reception and dance at the club the previous night, and he might
have walked in and out at random a dozen times without being
noticed.</p>

<p>"Not what you'd call illuminatin'," said Vance, when Markham had
given him this information.</p>

<p>"It eliminates Lindquist, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Quite. And, automatically, it eliminates him as an object of
suspicion in the Canary's death also; for these two crimes are part
of a whole&mdash;integers of the same problem. They complement each
other. The latter was conceived in relation to the first&mdash;was,
in fact, a logical outgrowth of it."</p>

<p>Markham nodded.</p>

<p>"That's reasonable enough. Anyway, I've passed the combative
stage. I think I'll drift for a while on the stream of your theory
and see what happens."</p>

<p>"What irks me is the disquietin' feeling that positively nothing
will happen unless we force the issue. The lad who maneuvered those
two obits had real bean in him."</p>

<p>As he spoke Spotswoode entered the room and looked about as if
searching for someone. Catching sight of Markham, he came briskly
forward, with a look of inquisitive perplexity.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for intruding, sir," he apologized, nodding
pleasantly to Vance and me, "but a police officer was here this
afternoon inquiring as to my whereabouts last night. It struck me
as strange, but I thought little of it until I happened to see the
name of Tony Skeel in the headlines of a 'special' tonight and read
he had been strangled. I remember you asked me regarding such a man
in connection with Miss Odell, and I wondered if, by any chance,
there could be any connection between the two murders, and if I
was, after all, to be drawn into the affair."</p>

<p>"No, I think not," said Markham. "There seemed a possibility
that the two crimes were related; and, as a matter of routine, the
police questioned all the close friends of Miss Odell in the hope
of turning up something suggestive. You may dismiss the matter from
your mind. I trust," he added, "the officer was not unpleasantly
importunate."</p>

<p>"Not at all." Spotswoode's look of anxiety disappeared. "He was
extremely courteous but a bit mysterious. Who was this man
Skeel?"</p>

<p>"A half-world character and ex-burglar. He had some hold on Miss
Odell, and, I believe, extorted money from her."</p>

<p>A cloud of angry disgust passed over Spotswoode's face. "A
creature like that deserves the fate that overtook him."</p>

<p>We chatted on various matters until ten o'clock, when Vance rose
and gave Markham a reproachful look.</p>

<p>"I'm going to try to recover some lost sleep. I'm
temperamentally unfitted for a policeman's life."</p>

<p>Despite this complaint, however, nine o'clock the next morning
found him at the district attorney's office. He had brought several
newspapers with him, and was reading, with much amusement, the
first complete accounts of Skeel's murder. Monday was generally a
busy day for Markham and he arrived at the office before half past
eight in an effort to clean up some pressing routine matters before
proceeding with his investigation of the Odell case. Heath, I knew,
was to come for a conference at ten o'clock. In the meantime there
was nothing for Vance to do but read the newspapers; and I occupied
myself in like manner.</p>

<p>Punctually at ten Heath arrived, and from his manner it was
plain that something had happened to cheer him immeasurably. He was
almost jaunty, and his formal, self-satisfied salutation to Vance
was like that of a conqueror to a vanquished adversary. He shook
hands with Markham with more than his customary punctility.</p>

<p>"Our troubles are over, sir," he said, and paused to light his
cigar. "I've arrested Jessup."</p>

<p>It was Vance who broke the dramatic silence following this
astounding announcement.</p>

<p>"In the name of Heaven&mdash;what for?"</p>

<p>Heath turned deliberately, in no wise abashed by the other's
tone.</p>

<p>"For the murder of Margaret Odell and Tony Skeel."</p>

<p>"Oh, my aunt! Oh, my precious aunt!" Vance sat up and stared at
him in amazement. "Sweet angels of Heaven, come down and solace
me!"</p>

<p>Heath's complacency was unshaken. "You won't need no angels, or
aunts either, when you hear what I've found out about this fellow.
I've got him tied up in a sack, ready to hand to the jury."</p>

<p>The first wave of Markham's astonishment had subsided. "Let's
have the story, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Heath settled himself in a chair. He took a few moments to
arrange his thoughts.</p>

<p>"It's like this, sir. Yesterday afternoon I got to thinking.
Here was Skeel murdered, same like Odell, after he'd promised to
squeal; and it certainly looked as though the same guy had
strangled both of 'em. Therefore, I concluded that there musta been
two guys in the apartment Monday night&mdash;the Dude and the
murderer&mdash;just like Mr. Vance has been saying all along. Then
I figured that they knew each other pretty well, because not only
did the other fellow know where the Dude lived, but he musta been
wise to the fact that the Dude was going to squeal yesterday. It
looked to me, sir, like they had pulled the Odell job
together&mdash;which is why the Dude didn't squeal in the first
place. But after the other fellow lost his nerve and threw the
jewelry away, Skeel thought he'd play safe by turning state's
evidence, so he phoned you."</p>

<p>The sergeant smoked a moment.</p>

<p>"I never put much stock in Mannix and Cleaver and the doc. They
weren't the kind to do a job like that, and they certainly weren't
the kind that would be mixed up with a jailbird like Skeel. So I
stood all three of 'em to one side and began looking around for a
bad egg&mdash;somebody who'd have been likely to be Skeel's
accomplice. But first I tried to figure out what you might call the
physical obstacles in the case&mdash;that is, the snags we were up
against in our reconstruction of the crime."</p>

<p>Again he paused.</p>

<p>"Now, the thing that's been bothering us most is that side door.
How did it get unbolted after six o'clock? And who bolted it again
after the crime? Skeel musta come in by it before eleven, because
he was in the apartment when Spotswoode and Odell returned from the
theater; and he probably went out by it after Cleaver had come to
the apartment at about midnight. But that wasn't explaining how it
got bolted again on the inside. Well, sir, I studied over this for
a long time yesterday and then I went up to the house and took
another look at the door. Young Spively was running the
switchboard, and I asked him where Jessup was, for I wanted to ask
him some questions. And Spively told me he'd quit his job the day
before&mdash;Saturday afternoon!"</p>

<p>Heath waited to let this fact sink in.</p>

<p>"I was on my way downtown before the idea came to me. Then it
hit me sudden-like; and the whole case broke wide open. Mr.
Markham, nobody but Jessup coulda opened that side door and locked
it again&mdash;nobody. Figure it out for yourself, sir&mdash;though
I guess you've pretty well done it already. Skeel couldn't've done
it. And there wasn't nobody else to do it."</p>

<p>Markham had become interested and leaned forward.</p>

<p>"After this idea had hit me," Heath continued, "I decided to
take a chance; so I got outa the subway at the Penn Station and
phoned Spively for Jessup's address. Then I got my first good news:
Jessup lived on Second Avenue, right around the corner from Skeel!
I picked up a coupla men from the local station and went to his
house. We found him packing up his things, getting ready to go to
Detroit. We locked him up, and I took his fingerprints and sent 'em
to Dubois. I thought I might get a line on him that way, because
crooks don't generally begin with a job as big as the Canary
prowl."</p>

<p>Heath permitted himself a grin of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, Dubois nailed him up! His name ain't Jessup at all.
The William part is all right, but his real moniker is Benton. He
was convicted of assault and battery in Oakland in 1909 and served
a year in San Quentin when Skeel was a prisoner there. He was also
grabbed as a lookout in a bank robbery in Brooklyn in 1914, but
didn't come to trial&mdash;that's how we happen to have his
fingerprints at Headquarters. When we put him on the grill last
night, he said he changed his name after the Brooklyn racket and
enlisted in the army. That's all we could get outa him; but we
didn't need any more. Now, here are the facts: Jessup has served
time for assault and battery. He was mixed up in a bank robbery.
Skeel was a fellow prisoner of his. He's got no alibi for Saturday
night when Skeel was killed and he lives round the corner. He quit
his job suddenly Saturday afternoon. He's husky and strong and
could easily have done the business. He was planning his getaway
when we nabbed him. <i>And</i><i>&mdash;</i>he's the only person
who could've unbolted and rebolted that side door Monday night...Is
that a case, or ain't it, Mr. Markham?"</p>

<p>Markham sat several minutes in thought.</p>

<p>"It's a good case as far as it goes," he said slowly. "But what
was his motive in strangling the girl?"</p>

<p>"That's easy. Mr. Vance here suggested it the first day. You
remember he asked Jessup about his feelings for Odell; and Jessup
turned red and got nervous."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" exclaimed Vance. "Am I to be made responsible for
any part of this priceless lunacy?...True, I pried into the chap's
emotions toward the lady; but that was before anything had come to
light. I was bein' careful&mdash;tryin' to test each possibility as
it arose."</p>

<p>"Well, that was a lucky question of yours, just the same." Heath
turned back to Markham. "As I see it: Jessup was stuck on Odell,
and she told him to trot along and sell his papers. He got all
worked up over it, sitting there night after night, seeing these
other guys calling on her. Then Skeel comes along, and, recognizing
him, suggests burglarizing Odell's apartment. Skeel can't do the
job without help, for he has to pass the phone operator coming and
going; and as he's been there before, he'd be recognized. Jessup
sees a chance of getting even with Odell and putting the blame on
someone else; so the two of 'em cook up the job for Monday night.
When Odell goes out, Jessup unlocks the side door, and the Dude
lets himself into the apartment with his own key. Then Odell and
Spotswoode arrive unexpectedly. Skeel hides in the closet, and
after Spotswoode has gone, he accidentally makes a noise, and Odell
screams. He steps out, and when she sees who he is, she tells
Spotswoode it's a mistake. Jessup now knows Skeel has been
discovered, and decides to make use of the fact. Soon after
Spotswoode has gone, he enters the apartment with a passkey. Skeel,
thinking it's somebody else, hides again in the closet; and then
Jessup grabs the girl and strangles her, intending to let Skeel get
the credit for it. But Skeel comes out of hiding and they talk it
over. Finally they come to an agreement, and proceed with their
original plan to loot the place. Jessup tries to open the jewel
case with the poker, and Skeel finishes the job with his chisel.
Then they go out. Skeel leaves by the side door, and Jessup rebolts
it. The next day Skeel hands the swag to Jessup to keep till things
blow over; and Jessup gets scared and throws it away. Then they
have a row. Skeel decides to tell everything, so he can get out
from under; and Jessup, suspecting he's going to do it, goes round
to his house Saturday night and strangles him like he did
Odell."</p>

<p>Heath made a gesture of finality and sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Clever&mdash;deuced clever," murmured Vance. "Sergeant, I
apologize for my little outburst a moment ago. Your logic is
irreproachable. You've reconstructed the crime beautifully. You've
solved the case...It's wonderful&mdash;simply wonderful. But it's
wrong."</p>

<p>"It's right enough to send Mr. Jessup to the chair."</p>

<p>"That's the terrible thing about logic," said Vance. "It so
often leads one irresistably to a false conclusion."</p>

<p>He stood up and walked across the room and back, his hands in
his coat pockets. When he came abreast of Heath he halted.</p>

<p>"I say, Sergeant; if somebody else could have unlocked that side
door and then rebolted it again after the crime, you'd be willing
to admit that it would weaken your case against Jessup&mdash;eh,
what?"</p>

<p>Heath was in a generous mood.</p>

<p>"Sure. Show me someone else who coulda done that, and I'll admit
that maybe I'm wrong."</p>

<p>"Skeel could have done it, Sergeant. And he did do
it&mdash;without anyone knowing it."</p>

<p>"Skeel! This ain't the age of miracles, Mr. Vance."</p>

<p>Vance swung about and faced Markham. "Listen! I'm telling you
Jessup's innocent." He spoke with a fervor that amazed me. "And I'm
going to prove it to you&mdash;some way. My theory is pretty
complete; it's deficient only in one or two small points; and, I'll
confess, I haven't yet been able to put a name to the culprit. But
it's the right theory, Markham, and it's diametrically opposed to
the sergeant's. Therefore, you've got to give me an opportunity to
demonstrate it before you proceed against Jessup. Now, I can't
demonstrate it here; so you and Heath must come over with me to the
Odell house. It won't take over an hour. But if it took a week,
you'd have to come just the same."</p>

<p>He stepped nearer to the desk.</p>

<p>"I know that it was Skeel, and not Jessup, who unbolted that
door before the crime and rebolted it afterward."</p>

<p>Markham was impressed.</p>

<p>"You know this&mdash;you know it for a fact?"</p>

<p>"Yes! And I know how he did it!"</p>

<h2>25 - VANCE DEMONSTRATES</h2>

<p><i>(Monday, September 17; 11:30 A.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Half an hour later we entered the little apartment house in 71st
Street. Despite the plausibility of Heath's case against Jessup,
Markham was not entirely satisfied with the arrest; and Vance's
attitude had sown further seeds of doubt in his mind. The strongest
point against Jessup was that relating to the bolting and unbolting
of the side door; and when Vance had asserted that he was able to
demonstrate how Skeel could have manipulated his own entrance and
exit, Markham, though only partly convinced, had agreed to
accompany him. Heath, too, was interested, and, though
supercilious, had expressed a willingness to go along.</p>

<p>Spively, scintillant in his chocolate-colored suit, was at the
switchboard and stared at us apprehensively. But when Vance
suggested pleasantly that he take a ten-minute walk round the
block, he appeared greatly relieved and lost no time in
complying.</p>

<p>The officer on guard outside of the Odell apartment came forward
and saluted.</p>

<p>"How goes it?" asked Heath. "Any visitors?"</p>

<p>"Only one&mdash;a toff who said he'd known the Canary and wanted
to see the apartment. I told him to get an order from you or the
district attorney."</p>

<p>"That was correct, Officer," said Markham; then, turning to
Vance: "Probably Spotswoode, poor devil."</p>

<p>"Quite," murmured Vance. "So persistent! Rosemary and all
that...Touchin'."</p>

<p>Heath told the officer to go for a half-hour's stroll; and we
were left alone.</p>

<p>"And now, Sergeant," said Vance cheerfully, "I'm sure you know
how to operate a switchboard. Be so kind as to act as Spively's
understudy for a few minutes&mdash;there's a good fellow...But,
first, please bolt the side door&mdash;and be sure that you bolt it
securely, just as it was on the fatal night."</p>

<p>Heath grinned good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Sure thing." He put his forefinger to his lips mysteriously,
and crouching, tiptoed down the hall like a burlesque detective in
a farce. After a few moments he came tiptoeing back to the
switchboard, his finger still on his lips. Then, glancing
surreptitiously about him with globular eyes, he put his mouth to
Vance's ear.</p>

<p>"His-s-st!" he whispered. "The door's bolted. Gr-r-r..." He sat
down at the switchboard. "When does the curtain go up, Mr.
Vance?"</p>

<p>"It's up, Sergeant." Vance fell in with Heath's jocular mood.
"Behold! The hour is half past nine on Monday night. You are
Spively&mdash;not nearly so elegant; and you forgot the
moustache&mdash;but still Spively. And I am the bedizened Skeel.
For the sake of realism, please try to imagine me in chamois gloves
and a pleated silk shirt. Mr. Markham and Mr. Van Dine here
represent 'the many-headed monster of the pit.'&mdash;And, by the
bye, Sergeant, let me have the key to the Odell apartment; Skeel
had one, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Heath produced the key and handed it over, still grinning.</p>

<p>"A word of stage direction," Vance continued. "When I have
departed by the front door, you are to wait exactly three minutes,
and then knock at the late Canary's apartment."</p>

<p>He sauntered to the front door and, turning, walked back toward
the switchboard. Markham and I stood behind Heath in the little
alcove, facing the front of the building.</p>

<p>"Enter Mr. Skeel!" announced Vance. "Remember, it's half past
nine." Then, as he came abreast of the switchboard: "Dash it all!
You forgot your lines, Sergeant. You should have told me that Miss
Odell was out. But it doesn't matter...Mr. Skeel continues to the
lady's door...thus."</p>

<p>He walked past us, and we heard him ring the apartment bell.
After a brief pause, he knocked on the door. Then he came back down
the hall.</p>

<p>"I guess you were right," he said, quoting the words of Skeel as
reported by Spively; and went on to the front door. Stepping out
into the street, he turned toward Broadway.</p>

<p>For exactly three minutes we waited. None of us spoke. Heath had
become serious, and his accelerated puffing on his cigar bore
evidence of his state of expectancy. Markham was frowning
stoically. At the end of the three minutes Heath rose and hurried
up the hall, with Markham and me at his heels. In answer to his
knock, the apartment door was opened from the inside. Vance was
standing in the little foyer.</p>

<p>"The end of the first act," he greeted us airly. "Thus did Mr.
Skeel enter the lady's boudoir Monday night after the side door had
been bolted, without the operator's seeing him."</p>

<p>Heath narrowed his eyes but said nothing. Then he suddenly swung
round and looked down the rear passageway to the oak door at the
end. The handle of the bolt was in a vertical position, showing
that the catch had been turned and that the door was unbolted.
Heath regarded it for several moments; then he turned his eyes
toward the switchboard. Presently he let out a gleeful whoop.</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Vance&mdash;very good!" he proclaimed, nodding
his head knowingly. "That was easy, though. And it don't take
psychology to explain it. After you rang the apartment bell, you
ran down this rear hallway and unbolted the door. Then you ran back
and knocked. After that you went out the front entrance, turned
toward Broadway, swung round across the street, came in the alley,
walked in the side door, and quietly let yourself into the
apartment behind our backs."</p>

<p>"Simple, wasn't it?" agreed Vance.</p>

<p>"Sure." The sergeant was almost contemptuous. "But that don't
get you nowhere. Anybody coulda figured it out if that had been the
only problem connected with Monday night's operations. But it's the
rebolting of that side door, after Skeel had gone, that's been
occupying my mind. Skeel might've&mdash;<i>might've</i><i>,</i>
mind you&mdash;got in the way you did. But he couldn't have got out
that way, because the door was bolted the next morning. And if
there was someone here to bolt the door after him, then that same
person could've unbolted the door for him earlier, without his
doing the ten-foot dash down the rear hall to unbolt the door
himself at half past nine. So I don't see that your interesting
little drama helps Jessup out any."</p>

<p>"Oh, but the drama isn't over," Vance replied. "The curtain is
about to go up on the next act."</p>

<p>Heath lifted his eyes sharply.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" His tone was one of almost jeering incredulity, but his
expression was searching and dubious. "And you're going to show us
how Skeel got out and bolted the door on the inside without
Jessup's help?"</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I intend to do, my sergeant."</p>

<p>Heath opened his mouth to speak but thought better of it.
Instead, he merely shrugged his shoulders and gave Markham a sly
look.</p>

<p>"Let us repair to the public atrium," proceeded Vance; and he
led us into the little reception room diagonally opposite to the
switchboard. This room as I have explained, was just beyond the
staircase, and along its rear wall ran the little passageway to the
side door. (A glance at the accompanying diagram will clarify the
arrangement.)</p>

<p><img alt="" src="0200351h-03.gif">
</p>

<p>Vance shepherded us ceremoniously to chairs and cocked his eye
at the sergeant.</p>

<p>"You will be so good as to rest here until you hear me knock at
the side door. Then come and open it for me." He went toward the
archway. "Once more I personate the departed Mr. Skeel; so picture
me again <i>en grande tenue</i>&mdash;sartorially radiant...The
curtain ascends."</p>

<p>He bowed and, stepping from the reception room into the main
hall, disappeared round the corner into the rear passageway.</p>

<p>Heath shifted his position restlessly and gave Markham a
questioning troubled look. "Will he pull it off, sir, do you
think?" All jocularity had gone out of his tone.</p>

<p>"I can't see how." Markham was scowling. "If he does, though, it
will knock the chief underpinning from your theory of Jessup's
guilt."</p>

<p>"I'm not worrying," declared Heath. "Mr. Vance knows a lot; he's
got ideas. But how in hell&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a loud knocking on the side door. The
three of us sprang up simultaneously and hurried round the corner
of the main hall. The rear passageway was empty. There was no door
or aperture of any kind on either side of it. It consisted of two
blank walls; and at the end, occupying almost its entire width, was
the oak door which led to the court. Vance could have disappeared
only through that oak door. And the thing we all noticed at
once&mdash;for our eyes had immediately sought it&mdash;was the
horizontal position of the bolt handle. This meant that the door
was bolted.</p>

<p>Heath was not merely astonished&mdash;he was dumbfounded.
Markham had halted abruptly, and stood staring down the empty
passageway as if he saw a ghost. After a momentary hesitation Heath
walked rapidly to the door. But he did not open it at once. He went
down on his knees before the lock and scrutinized the bolt
carefully. Then he took out his pocket knife and inserted the blade
into the crack between the door and the casing. The point halted
against the inner moulding, and the edge of the blade scraped upon
the circular bolt. There was no question that the heavy oak casings
and mouldings of the door were solid and well fitted, and that the
bolt had been securely thrown from the inside. Heath, however, was
still suspicious and, grasping the doorknob, he tugged at it
violently. But the door held firmly. At length he threw the bolt
handle to a vertical position and opened the door. Vance was
standing in the court, placidly smoking and inspecting the
brickwork of the alley wall.</p>

<p>"I say, Markham," he remarked, "here's a curious thing. This
wall, d' ye know, must be very old. It wasn't built in these latter
days of breathless efficiency. The beauty-loving mason who erected
it laid the bricks in Flemish bond instead of the Running&mdash;or
Stretcher&mdash;bond of our own restless age. And up there a
bit"&mdash;he pointed toward the rear yard&mdash;"is a Rowlock and
Checkerboard pattern. Very neat and very pretty&mdash;more pleasing
even than the popular English Cross bond. And the mortar joints are
all V-tooled...Fancy!"</p>

<p>Markham was fuming. "Damn it, Vance! I'm not building brick
walls. What I want to know is how you got out here and left the
door bolted on the inside."</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" Vance crushed out his cigarette and reentered the
building. "I merely made use of a bit of clever criminal mechanism.
It's very simple, like all truly effective appliances&mdash;oh,
simple beyond words. I blush at its simplicity...Observe!"</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a tiny pair of tweezers to the end of
which was tied a piece of purple twine about four feet long.
Placing the tweezers over the vertical bolt handle, he turned them
at a very slight angle to the left and then ran the twine under the
door so that about a foot of it projected over the sill. Stepping
into the court, he closed the door. The tweezers still held the
bolt handle as in a vise, and the string extended straight to the
floor and disappeared under the door into the court. The three of
us stood watching the bolt with fascinated attention. Slowly the
string became taut, as Vance gently pulled upon the loose end
outside, and then the downward tug began slowly but surely to turn
the bolt handle. When the bolt had been thrown and the handle was
in a horizontal position, there came a slight jerk on the string.
The tweezers were disengaged from the bolt handle and fell
noiselessly to the carpeted floor. Then as the string was pulled
from without, the tweezers disappeared under the crack between the
bottom of the door and the sill.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="0200351h-04.gif">
</p>

<p>"Childish, what?" commented Vance, when Heath had let him in.
"Silly, too, isn't it? And yet, Sergeant dear, that's how the
deceased Tony left these premises last Monday night...But let's go
into the lady's apartment, and I'll tell you a story. I see that
Mr. Spively has returned from his promenade; so he can resume his
telephonic duties and leave us free for a <i>causerie."</i></p>

<p>"When did you think up that hocus-pocus with the tweezers and
string?" demanded Markham irritably, when we were seated in the
Odell living room.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it up at all, don't y' know," Vance told him
carelessly, selecting a cigarette with annoying deliberation. "It
was Mr. Skeel's idea. Ingenious lad&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"Come, come!" Markham's equanimity was at last shaken. "How can
you possibly know that Skeel used this means of locking himself
out?"</p>

<p>"I found the little apparatus in his evening clothes yesterday
morning."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Heath belligerently. "You took that outa Skeel's
room yesterday during the search without saying anything about
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, only after your ferrets had passed it by. In fact, I didn't
even look at the gentleman's clothes until your experienced
searchers had inspected them and relocked the wardrobe door. Y'
see, Sergeant, this little thingumbob was stuffed away in one of
the pockets of Skeel's dress waistcoat, under the silver cigarette
case. I'll admit I went over his evening suit rather lovin'ly. He
wore it, y' know, on the night the lady departed this life, and I
hoped to find some slight indication of his collaboration in the
event. When I found this little eyebrow plucker, I hadn't the
slightest inkling of its significance. And the purple twine
attached to it bothered me frightfully, don't y' know. I could see
that Mr. Skeel didn't pluck his eyebrows; and even if he had been
addicted to the practice, why the twine? The tweezers are a
delicate little gold affair&mdash;just what the ravishin' Margaret
might have used; and last Tuesday morning I noticed a small lacquer
tray containing similar toilet accessories on her dressing table
near the jewel case. But that wasn't all."</p>

<p>He pointed to the little vellum wastebasket beside the
escritoire, in which lay a large crumpled mass of heavy paper.</p>

<p>"I also noticed that piece of discarded wrapping-paper stamped
with the name of a well-known Fifth Avenue novelty shop; and this
morning, on my way downtown, I dropped in at the shop and learned
that they make a practice of tying up their bundles with purple
twine. Therefore, I concluded that Skeel had taken the tweezers and
the twine from this apartment during his visit here that eventful
night...Now, the question was: Why should he have spent his time
tying strings to eyebrow pluckers? I confess, with maidenly
modesty, that I couldn't find an answer. But this morning when you
told of arresting Jessup and emphasized the rebolting of the side
door after Skeel's departure, the fog lifted, the sun shone, the
birds began to sing. I became suddenly mediumistic; I had a psychic
seizure. The whole <i>modus operandi</i> came to me&mdash;as they
say&mdash;in a flash...I told you, Markham old thing, it would take
spiritualism to solve this case."</p>

<h2>26 - RECONSTRUCTING THE CRIME</h2>

<p><i>(Monday, September 17; noon)</i>
</p>

<p>When Vance finished speaking, there was several minutes'
silence. Markham sat deep in his chair glaring into space. Heath,
however, was watching Vance with a kind of grudging admiration. The
cornerstone in the foundation of his case against Jessup had been
knocked out, and the structure he had built was tottering
precariously. Markham realized this, and the fact played havoc with
his hopes.</p>

<p>"I wish your inspirations were more helpful," he grumbled,
turning his gaze upon Vance. "This latest revelation of yours puts
us back almost to where we started from."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be pessimistic. Let us face the future with a bright
eye...Want to hear my theory?&mdash;it's fairly bulging with
possibilities." He arranged himself comfortably in his chair.
"Skeel needed money&mdash;no doubt his silk shirts were running
low&mdash;and after his unsuccessful attempt to extort it from the
lady a week before her demise, he came here last Monday night. He
had learned she would be out, and he intended to wait for her; for
she had probably refused to receive him in the custom'ry social
way. He knew the side door was bolted at night, and, as he didn't
want to be seen entering the apartment, he devised the little
scheme of unbolting the door for himself under cover of a futile
call at half past nine. The unbolting accomplished, he returned via
the alleyway, and let himself into the apartment at some time
before eleven. When the lady returned with an escort, he quickly
hid in the clothes closet, and remained there until the escort had
departed. Then he came forth, and the lady, startled by his sudden
appearance, screamed. But, on recognizing him, she told Spotswoode,
who was now hammering at the door, that it was all a mistake. So
Spotswoode ran along and played poker. A financial discussion
between Skeel and the lady&mdash;probably a highly acrimonious
tiff&mdash;ensued. In the midst of it the telephone rang, and Skeel
snatched off the receiver and said the Canary was out. The tiff was
resumed; but presently another suitor appeared on the scene.
Whether he rang the bell or let himself in with a key I can't
say&mdash;probably the latter, for the phone operator was unaware
of his visit. Skeel hid himself a second time in the closet and
luckily took the precaution of locking himself in. Also, he quite
naturally put his eye to the keyhole to see who the second intruder
was."</p>

<p>Vance pointed to the closet door.</p>

<p>"The keyhole, you will observe, is on a line with the davenport;
and as Skeel peered out into the room he saw a sight that froze his
blood. The new arrival&mdash;in the midst, perhaps, of some
endearing sentence&mdash;seized the lady by the throat and
proceeded to throttle her...Imagine Skeel's emotions, my dear
Markham. There he was, crouching in a dark closet, and a few feet
from him stood a murderer in the act of strangling a lady!
<i>Pauvre Antoine!</i> I don't wonder he was petrified and
speechless. He saw what he imagined to be maniacal fury in the
strangler's eyes; and the strangler must have been a fairly
powerful creature, whereas Skeel was slender and almost
undersized...No, <i>merci.</i> Skeel wasn't having any. He lay
doggo. And I can't say that I blame the beggar, what?"</p>

<p>He made a gesture of interrogation.</p>

<p>"What did the strangler do next? Well, well; we'll probably
never know, now that Skeel, the horrified witness, has gone to his
Maker. But I rather imagine he got out that black document box,
opened it with a key he had taken from the lady's handbag, and
extracted a goodly number of incriminating documents. Then, I
fancy, the fireworks began. The gentleman proceeded to wreck the
apartment in order to give the effect of a professional burglary.
He tore the lace on the lady's gown and severed the shoulder strap;
snatched her orchid corsage and threw it in her lap; stripped off
her rings and bracelets; and tore the pendant from its chain. After
that he upset the lamp, rifled the escritoire, ransacked the Boule
cabinet, broke the mirror, overturned the chairs, tore the
draperies...And all the time Skeel kept his eye glued to the
keyhole with fascinated horror, afraid to move, terrified lest he
be discovered and sent to join his erstwhile <i>inamorata,</i> for
by now he was no doubt thoroughly convinced that the man outside
was a raving lunatic. I can't say that I envy Skeel his
predicament; it was ticklish, y' know. Rather! And the devastation
went on. He could hear it even when the operations had passed from
out his radius of vision. And he himself was caught like a rat in a
trap, with no means of escape. A harrowin' situation&mdash;my
word!"</p>

<p>Vance smoked a moment and then shifted his position
slightly.</p>

<p>"Y' know, Markham, I imagine that the worst moment in the whole
of Skeel's checkered career came when that mysterious wrecker tried
to open the closet door behind which he was crouching. Fancy! There
he was cornered, and not two inches from him stood, apparently, a
homicidal maniac trying to get to him, rattling that thin barricade
of white pine...Can you picture the blighter's relief when the
murderer finally released the knob and turned away? It's a wonder
he didn't collapse from the reaction. But he didn't. He listened
and watched in a sort of hypnotic panic, until he heard the invader
leave the apartment. Then, weak-kneed and in a cold sweat, he came
forth and surveyed the battlefield."</p>

<p>Vance glanced about him.</p>

<p>"Not a pretty sight&mdash;eh, what? And there on the davenport
reclined the lady's strangled body. That corpse was Skeel's
dominant horror. He staggered to the table to look at it, and
steadied himself with his right hand&mdash;that's how you got your
fingerprints, Sergeant. Then the realization of his own position
suddenly smote him. Here he was alone with a murdered person. He
was known to have been intimate with the lady; and he was a burglar
with a record. Who would believe that he was innocent? And though
he had probably recognized the man who had negotiated the business,
he was in no position to tell his story. Everything was against
him&mdash;his sneaking in, his presence in the house at half past
nine, his relations with the girl, his profession, his reputation.
He hadn't a chance in the world...I say, Markham, would <i>you</i>
have credited his tale?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," retorted Markham. "Go on with your theory."
He and Heath had been listening with rapt interest.</p>

<p>"My theory from this point on," resumed Vance, "is what you
might term self-developing. It proceeds on its own inertia, so to
speak.&mdash;Skeel was confronted by the urgent problem of getting
away and covering up his tracks. His mind in this emergency became
keen and highly active; his life was forfeit if he didn't succeed.
He began to think furiously. He could have left by the side door at
once without being seen; but then, the door would have been
unbolted. And this fact, taken in connection with his earlier visit
that night, would have suggested his manner of unbolting the
door...No, that method of escape wouldn't do&mdash;decidedly it
wouldn't do. He knew he was likely, in any event, to be suspected
of the murder, in view of his shady association with the lady and
his general character. Motive, place, opportunity, time, means,
conduct, and his own record&mdash;all were against him. Either he
must cover up his tracks, don't y' know, or else his career as a
Lothario was at an end. A sweet dilemma! He realized, of course,
that if he could get out and leave that side door bolted on the
inside, he'd be comparatively safe. No one could then explain how
he had come in or gone out. It would establish his only possible
alibi&mdash;a negative one, to be sure; but, with a good lawyer, he
could probably make it hold. Doubtless he searched for other means
of escape, but found himself confronted with obstacles on every
hand. The side door was his only hope. How could it be worked?"</p>

<p>Vance rose and yawned.</p>

<p>"That's my caressin' theory. Skeel was caught in a trap, and
with his shrewd, tricky brain he figured his way out. He may have
roamed up and down these two rooms for hours before he hit on his
plan; and it's not unlikely that he appealed to the Deity with an
occasional 'Oh, my God!' As for his using the tweezers, I'm
inclined to think the mechanism of the idea came to him almost
immediately&mdash;Y' know, Sergeant, this locking of a door on the
inside is an old trick. There are any number of recorded cases of
it in the criminal literature of Europe. Indeed, in Professor Hans
Gross's handbook of criminology there's a whole chapter on the
devices used by burglars for illegal entries and exits.* But all
such devices have had to do with the locking, not the bolting, of
doors. The principle, of course, is the same, but the technic is
different. To lock a door on the inside, a needle, or strong
slender pin, is inserted through the bow of the key and pulled
downward with a string. But on the side door of this house there is
no lock and key; nor is there a bow in the bolt handle.&mdash;Now,
the resourceful Skeel, while pacing nervously about, looking for
something that might offer a suggestion, probably espied the
tweezers on the lady's dressing table&mdash;no lady nowadays is
without these little eyebrow pluckers, don't y' know&mdash;and
immediately his problem was solved. It remained only to test the
device. Before departing, however, he chiseled open the jewel case
which the other chap had merely dented, and found the solitaire
diamond ring that he later attempted to pawn. Then he erased, as he
thought, all his fingerprints, forgetting to wipe off the inside
doorknob of the closet and overlooking the hand mark on the table.
After that he let himself out quietly and rebolted the side door
the same as I did, stuffing the tweezers in his waistcoat pocket
and forgetting them."</p>

<p>* The treatise referred to by Vance was <i>Handbuch f&uuml;r
Untersuchungsrichter als System der Kriminalistik.</i></p>

<p>Heath nodded his head oracularly.</p>

<p>"A crook, no matter how clever he is, always overlooks
something."</p>

<p>"Why single out crooks for your criticism, Sergeant?" asked
Vance lazily. "Do you know of anybody in this imperfect world who
doesn't always overlook something?" He gave Heath a benignant
smile. "Even the police, don't y' know, overlooked the
tweezers."</p>

<p>Heath grunted. His cigar had gone out, and he relighted it
slowly and thoroughly. "What do you think, Mr. Markham?"</p>

<p>"The situation doesn't become much clearer," was Markham's
gloomy comment.</p>

<p>"My theory isn't exactly a blindin' illumination," said Vance.
"Yet I wouldn't say that it left things in pristine darkness. There
are certain inferences to be drawn from my vagaries. To wit: Skeel
either knew or recognized the murderer; and once he had made good
his escape from the apartment and had regained a modicum of
self-confidence, he undoubtedly blackmailed his homicidal confrere.
His death was merely another manifestation of our <i>inconnu's</i>
bent for ridding himself of persons who annoyed him. Furthermore,
my theory accounts for the chiseled jewel case, the fingerprints,
the unmolested closet, the finding of the gems in the refuse
tin&mdash;the person who took them really didn't want them, y'
know&mdash;and Skeel's silence. It also explains the unbolting and
bolting of the side door."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Markham. "It seems to clarify everything but the
one all important point&mdash;the identity of the murderer."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Vance. "Let's go to lunch."</p>

<p>Heath, morose and confused, departed for police headquarters;
and Markham, Vance, and I rode to Delmonico's, where we chose the
main dining room in preference to the grill.</p>

<p>"The case now would seem to center in Cleaver and Mannix," said
Markham, when we had finished our luncheon. "If your theory that
the same man killed both Skeel and the Canary is correct, then
Lindquist is out of it, for he certainly was in the Episcopal
Hospital Saturday night."</p>

<p>"Quite," agreed Vance. "The doctor is unquestionably
eliminated...Yes: Cleaver and Mannix&mdash;they're the allurin'
twins. Don't see any way to go beyond them." He frowned and sipped
his coffee. "My original quartet is dwindling, and I don't like it.
It narrows the thing down too much&mdash;there's no scope for the
mind, as it were, in only two choices. What if we should succeed in
eliminating Cleaver and Mannix? Where would we be&mdash;eh, what?
Nowhere&mdash;simply nowhere. And yet, one of the quartet is
guilty; let's cling to that consolin' fact. It can't be Spotswoode
and it can't be Lindquist. Cleaver and Mannix remain: two from four
leaves two. Simple arithmetic, what? The only trouble is, this case
isn't simple. Lord, no!&mdash;I say, how would the equation work
out if we used algebra, or spherical trigonometry, or differential
calculus? Let's cast it in the fourth dimension&mdash;or the fifth,
or the sixth..." He held his temples in both hands. "Oh, promise,
Markham&mdash;promise me that you'll hire a kind, gentle keeper for
me."</p>

<p>"I know how you feel. I've been in the same mental state for a
week."</p>

<p>"It's the quartet idea that's driving me mad," moaned Vance. "It
wrings me to have my tetrad lopped off in such brutal fashion. I'd
set my young trustin' heart on that quartet, and now it's only a
pair. My sense of order and proportion has been outraged...I want
my quartet."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to be satisfied with two of them,"
Markham returned wearily. "One of them can't qualify, and one is in
bed. You might send some flowers to the hospital if it would cheer
you any."</p>

<p>"One is in bed&mdash;one is in bed," repeated Vance. "Well,
well&mdash;to be sure! And one from four leaves three. More
arithmetic. Three!...On the other hand, there is no such thing as a
straight line. All lines are curved; they transcribe circles in
space. They look straight, but they're not. Appearances, y
know&mdash;so deceptive!...Let's enter the silence, and substitute
mentation for sight."</p>

<p>He gazed up out of the great windows into Fifth Avenue. For
several moments he sat smoking thoughtfully. When he spoke again,
it was in an even, deliberate voice.</p>

<p>"Markham, would it be difficult for you to invite Mannix and
Cleaver and Spotswoode to spend an evening&mdash;this evening, let
us say&mdash;in your apartment?"</p>

<p>Markham set down his cup with a clatter and regarded Vance
narrowly. "What new harlequinade is this?"</p>

<p>"Fie on you! Answer my question."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I might arrange it," replied Markham
hesitantly. "They're all more or less under my jurisdiction at
present."</p>

<p>"So that such an invitation would be rather in line with the
situation&mdash;eh, what? And they wouldn't be likely to refuse
you, old dear&mdash;would they?"</p>

<p>"No, I hardly think so..."</p>

<p>"And if, when they had assembled in your quarters, you should
propose a few hands of poker, they'd probably accept, without
thinking the suggestion strange?"</p>

<p>"Probably," said Markham, nonplussed at Vance's amazing request.
"Cleaver and Spotswoode both play, I know; and Mannix doubtless
knows the game. But why poker? Are you serious, or has your
threatened dementia already overtaken you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm deuced serious." Vance's tone left no doubt as to the
fact. "The game of poker, d' ye see, is the crux of the matter. I
knew Cleaver was an old hand at the game; and Spotswoode, of
course, played with Judge Redfern last Monday night. So that gave
me a basis for my plan. Mannix, we'll assume, also plays."</p>

<p>He leaned forward, speaking earnestly.</p>

<p>"Nine-tenths of poker, Markham, is psychology; and if one
understands the game, one can learn more of a man's inner nature at
a poker table in an hour than during a year's casual association
with him. You rallied me once when I said I could lead you to the
perpetrator of any crime by examining the factors of the crime
itself. But naturally I must know the man to whom I am to lead you;
otherwise I cannot relate the psychological indications of the
crime to the culprit's nature. In the present case, I know the kind
of man who committed the crime; but I am not sufficiently
acquainted with the suspects to point out the guilty one. However,
after our game of poker I hope to be able to tell you who planned
and carried out the Canary's murder."*</p>

<p>* Recently I ran across an article by Doctor George A. Dorsey,
professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, and author
of "Why We Behave Like Human Beings," which bore intimate testimony
to the scientific accuracy of Vance's theory. In it Doctor Dorsey
said: "Poker is a cross-section of life. The way a man behaves in a
poker game is the way he behaves in life...His success or failure
lies in the way his physical organism responds to the stimuli
supplied by the game...I have studied humanity all my life from the
anthropologic and psychological viewpoint. And I have yet to find a
better laboratory exercise than to observe the manners of men as
they see my raise and come back at me...The psychologist's
verbalized, visceral, and manual behaviors are functioning at their
highest in a poker game...I can truthfully say that I learned about
men from poker."</p>

<p>Markham gazed at him in blank astonishment. He knew that Vance
played poker with amazing skill and that he possessed an uncanny
knowledge of the psychological elements in the game; but he was
unprepared for the latter's statement that he might be able to
solve the Odell murder by means of it. Yet Vance had spoken with
such undoubted earnestness that Markham was impressed. I knew what
was passing in his mind almost as well as if he had voiced his
thoughts. He was recalling the way in which Vance had, in a former
murder case, put his finger unerringly on the guilty man by a
similar process of psychological deduction. And he was also telling
himself that, however incomprehensible and seemingly extravagant
Vance's requests were, there was always a fundamentally sound
reason behind them.</p>

<p>"Damn it!" he muttered at last. "The whole scheme seems
idiotic...And yet, if you really want a game of poker with these
men, I've no special objection. It'll get you nowhere&mdash;I'll
tell you that beforehand. It's stark nonsense to suppose that you
can find the guilty man by such fantastic means."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," sighed Vance, "a little futile recreation will do us
no harm."</p>

<p>"But why do you include Spotswoode?"</p>

<p>"Really, y' know, I haven't the slightest notion&mdash;except,
of course, that he's one of my quartet. And we'll need an extra
hand."</p>

<p>"Well, don't tell me afterwards that I'm to lock him up for
murder. I'd have to draw the line. Strange as it may seem to your
layman's mind, I wouldn't care to prosecute a man, knowing that it
was physically impossible for him to have committed the crime."</p>

<p>"As to that," drawled Vance, "the only obstacles that stand in
the way of physical impossibilities are material facts. And
material facts are notoriously deceivin'. Really, y' know, you
lawyers would do better if you ignored them entirely."</p>

<p>Markham did not deign to answer such heresy, but the look he
gave Vance was most expressive.</p>

<h2>27 - A GAME OF POKER</h2>

<p><i>(Monday, September 17; 9 P.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Vance and I went home after lunch, and at about four o'clock
Markham telephoned to say that he had made the necessary
arrangements for the evening with Spotswoode, Mannix, and Cleaver.
Immediately following this confirmation Vance left the house and
did not return until nearly eight o'clock. Though I was filled with
curiosity at so unusual a proceeding, he refused to enlighten me.
But when, at a quarter to nine, we went downstairs to the waiting
car, there was a man I did not know in the tonneau; and I at once
connected him with Vance's mysterious absence.</p>

<p>"I've asked Mr. Allen to join us tonight," Vance vouchsafed,
when he had introduced us. "You don't play poker, and we really
need another hand to make the game interestin', y' know. Mr. Allen,
by the bye, is an old antagonist of mine."</p>

<p>The fact that Vance would, apparently without permission, bring
an uninvited guest to Markham's apartment amazed me but little more
than the appearance of the man himself. He was rather short, with
sharp, shrewd features; and what I saw of his hair beneath his
jauntily tipped hat was black and sleek, like the painted hair on
Japanese dolls. I noted, too, that his evening tie was enlivened by
a design of tiny white forget-me-nots, and that his shirtfront was
adorned with diamond studs.</p>

<p>The contrast between him and the immaculately stylish and
meticulously correct Vance was aggressively evident. I wondered
what could be the relationship between them. Obviously it was
neither social nor intellectual.</p>

<p>Cleaver and Mannix were already on hand when we were ushered
into Markham's drawing room, and a few minutes later Spotswoode
arrived. The amenities of introduction over, we were soon seated
comfortably about the open log fire, smoking, and sipping very
excellent Scotch highballs. Markham had, of course, accepted the
unexpected Mr. Allen cordially, but his occasional glances in the
latter's direction told me he was having some difficulty in
reconciling the man's appearance with Vance's sponsorship.</p>

<p>A tense atmosphere lay beneath the spurious and affected
affability of the little gathering. Indeed, the situation was
scarcely conducive to spontaneity. Here were three men each of whom
was known to the others to have been interested in the same woman;
and the reason for their having been brought together was the fact
that this woman had been murdered. Markham, however, handled the
situation with such tact that he largely succeeded in giving each
one the feeling of being a disinterested spectator summoned to
discuss an abstract problem. He explained at the outset that the
"conference" had been actuated by his failure to find any approach
to the problem of the murder. He hoped, he said, by a purely
informal discussion, divested of all officialism and coercion, to
turn up some suggestion that might lead to a fruitful line of
inquiry. His manner was one of friendly appeal, and when he
finished speaking, the general tension had been noticeably
relaxed.</p>

<p>During the discussion that followed I was interested in the
various attitudes of the men concerned. Cleaver spoke bitterly of
his part in the affair, and was more self-condemnatory than
suggestive. Mannix was voluble and pretentiously candid, but
beneath his comments ran a strain of apologetic wariness.
Spotswoode, unlike Mannix, seemed loath to discuss the matter and
maintained a consistently reticent attitude. He responded politely
to Markham's questions, but he did not succeed entirely in hiding
his resentment at thus being dragged into a general discussion.
Vance had little to say, limiting himself to occasional remarks
directed always to Markham. Allen did not speak but sat
contemplating the others with a sort of canny amusement.</p>

<p>The entire conversation struck me as utterly futile. Had Markham
really hoped to garner information from it, he would have been
woefully disappointed. I realized, though, that he was merely
endeavoring to justify himself for having taken so unusual a step
and to pave the way for the game of poker which Vance had
requested. When the time came to broach the subject, however, there
was no difficulty about it.</p>

<p>It was exactly eleven o'clock when he made the suggestion. His
tone was gracious and unassuming; but by couching his invitation in
terms of a personal request, he practically precluded declination.
But his verbal strategy, I felt, was unnecessary. Both Cleaver and
Spotswoode seemed genuinely to welcome the opportunity of dropping
a distasteful discussion in favor of playing cards; and Vance and
Allen, of course, concurred instantly. Mannix alone declined. He
explained that he knew the game only slightly and disliked it;
though he expressed an enthusiastic desire to watch the others.
Vance urged him to reconsider but without success; and Markham
finally ordered his man to arrange the table for five.</p>

<p>I noticed that Vance waited until Allen had taken his place, and
then dropped into the chair at his right. Cleaver took the seat at
Allen's left. Spotswoode sat at Vance's right; and then came
Markham. Mannix drew up his chair midway behind Markham and
Cleaver. Thus:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="0200351h-05.gif">
</p>

<p>Cleaver first named a rather moderate limit, but Spotswoode at
once suggested much larger stakes. Then Vance went still higher,
and as both Markham and Allen signified their agreement, his figure
was accepted. The prices placed on the chips somewhat took my
breath away, and even Mannix whistled softly.</p>

<p>That all five men at the table were excellent players became
obvious before the game had progressed ten minutes. For the first
time that night Vance's friend Allen seemed to have found his
milieu and to be wholly at ease.</p>

<p>Allen won the first two hands, and Vance the third and fourth.
Spotswoode then had a short run of good luck, and a little later
Markham took a large jackpot, which put him slightly in the lead.
Cleaver was the only loser thus far; but in another half-hour he
had succeeded in recovering a large portion of his losses. After
that Vance forged steadily ahead, only to relinquish his winning
streak to Allen. Then for a while the fortunes of the game were
rather evenly distributed. But later on both Cleaver and Spotswoode
began to lose heavily. By half past twelve a grim atmosphere had
settled over the party; for so high were the stakes, and so rapidly
did the betting pyramid, that even for men of means&mdash;such as
all these players undoubtedly were&mdash;the amounts which
continually changed hands represented very considerable items.</p>

<p>Just before one o'clock, when the fever of the game had reached
a high point, I saw Vance glance quickly at Allen and pass his
handkerchief across his forehead. To a stranger the gesture would
have appeared perfectly natural; but, so familiar was I with
Vance's mannerisms, I immediately recognized its artificiality. And
simultaneously I noticed that it was Allen who was shuffling the
cards preparatory to dealing. Some smoke from his cigar evidently
went into his eye at that moment, for he blinked, and one of the
cards fell to the floor. Quickly retrieving it, he reshuffled the
deck and placed it before Vance to cut.</p>

<p>The hand was a jackpot, and there was a small fortune in chips
already on the table. Cleaver, Markham, and Spotswoode passed. The
decision thus reached Vance, and he opened for an unusually large
amount. Allen at once laid down his hand, but Cleaver stayed. Then
Markham and Spotswoode both dropped out, leaving the entire play
between Vance and Cleaver. Cleaver drew one card, and Vance, who
had opened, drew two. Vance made a nominal wager, and Cleaver
raised it substantially. Vance in turn raised Cleaver, but only for
a small amount; and Cleaver again raised Vance&mdash;this time for
an even larger sum than before. Vance hesitated, and called him.
Cleaver exposed his hand triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Straight flush&mdash;jack high," he announced. "Can you beat
that?"</p>

<p>"Not on a two-card draw," said Vance ruefully. He put his cards
down to show his openers. He had four kings.</p>

<p>About half an hour later Vance again took out his handkerchief
and passed it across his forehead. As before, I noted that it was
Allen's deal, and also that the hand was a jackpot which had been
twice sweetened. Allen paused to take a drink of his highball and
to light his cigar. Then, after Vance had cut the cards, he dealt
them.</p>

<p>Cleaver, Markham, and Spotswoode passed, and again Vance opened,
for the full amount of the pot. No one stayed except Spotswoode;
and this time it was a struggle solely between him and Vance.
Spotswoode asked for one card; and Vance stood pat. Then there
followed a moment of almost breathless silence. The atmosphere
seemed to me to be electrically charged, and I think the others
sensed it too, for they were watching the play with a curiously
strained intentness. Vance and Spotswoode, however, appeared frozen
in attitudes of superlative calm. I watched them closely, but
neither revealed the slightest indication of any emotion.</p>

<p>It was Vance's first bet. Without speaking he moved a stack of
yellow chips to the center of the table&mdash;it was by far the
largest wager that had been made during the game. But immediately
Spotswoode measured another stack alongside of it. Then he coolly
and deftly counted the remainder of his chips, and pushed them
forward with the palm of his hand, saying quietly, "The limit."</p>

<p>Vance shrugged almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"The pot, sir, is yours." He smiled pleasantly at Spotswoode and
put down his hand face up, to establish his openers. He had held
four aces!</p>

<p>"Gad! That's poker!" exclaimed Allen, chuckling.</p>

<p>"Poker?" echoed Markham. "To lay down four aces with all that
money at stake?"</p>

<p>Cleaver also grunted his astonishment, and Mannix pursed his
lips disgustedly.</p>

<p>"I don't mean any offense, y' understand, Mr. Vance," he said.
"But looking at that play from a strictly business standpoint, I'd
say you quit too soon."</p>

<p>Spotswoode glanced up.</p>

<p>"You gentlemen wrong Mr. Vance," he said. "He played his hand
perfectly. His withdrawal, even with four aces, was scientifically
correct."</p>

<p>"Sure it was," agreed Allen. "Oh, boy! What a battle that
was!"</p>

<p>Spotswoode nodded and, turning to Vance, said, "Since the exact
situation is never likely to occur again, the least I can do, by
way of showing my appreciation of your remarkable perception, is to
gratify your curiosity. I held nothing."</p>

<p>Spotswoode put down his hand and extended his fingers gracefully
toward the upturned cards. There were revealed a five, six, seven,
and eight of clubs, and a knave of hearts.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I follow your reasoning, Mr. Spotswoode,"
Markham confessed. "Mr. Vance had you beaten&mdash;and he
quit."</p>

<p>"Consider the situation," Spotswoode replied, in a suave, even
voice. "I most certainly would have opened so rich a pot, had I
been able to, after Mr. Cleaver and you had passed. But since I
nevertheless stayed after Mr. Vance had opened for so large an
amount, it goes without saying that I must have had either a
four-straight, a four-flush, or a four-straight-flush. I believe I
may state without immodesty that I am too good a player to have
stayed otherwise..."</p>

<p>"And I assure you, Markham," interrupted Vance, "that Mr.
Spotswoode is too good a player to have stayed unless he had
actually had a four-straight-flush. That is the only hand he would
have been justified in backing at the betting odds of two to one.
You see, I had opened for the amount in the pot, and Mr. Spotswoode
had to put up half the amount of the money on the table in order to
stay&mdash;making it a two-to-one bet. Now, these odds are not
high, and any nonopening hand smaller than a four-straight-flush
would not have warranted the risk. As it was, he had, with a
one-card draw, two chances in forty-seven of making a
straight-flush, nine chances in forty-seven of making a flush, and
eight chances in forty-seven of making a straight; so that he had
nineteen chances in forty-seven&mdash;or more than one chance in
three&mdash;of strengthening his hand into either a straight-flush,
a flush, or a straight."</p>

<p>"Exactly," assented Spotswoode. "However, after I had drawn my
one card, the only possible question in Mr. Vance's mind was
whether or not I had made my straight-flush. If I had not made
it&mdash;or had merely drawn a straight or a flush&mdash;Mr. Vance
figured, and figured rightly, that I would not have seen his large
bet and also have raised it the limit. To have done so, in those
circumstances, would have been irrational poker. Not one player in
a thousand would have taken such a risk on a mere bluff. Therefore,
had Mr. Vance not laid down his four aces when I raised him, he
would have been foolhardy in the extreme. It turned out, of course,
that I was actually bluffing; but that does not alter the fact that
the correct and logical thing was for Mr. Vance to quit."</p>

<p>"Quite true," Vance agreed. "As Mr. Spotswoode says, not one
player in a thousand would have wagered the limit without having
filled his straight-flush, knowing I had a pat hand. Indeed, one
might also say that Mr. Spotswoode, by doing so, has added another
decimal point to the psychological subtleties of the game; for, as
you see, he analyzed my reasoning, and carried his own reasoning a
step further."</p>

<p>Spotswoode acknowledged the compliment with a slight bow; and
Cleaver reached for the cards and began to shuffle them. But the
tension had been broken, and the game was not resumed.</p>

<p>Something, however, seemed to have gone wrong with Vance. For a
long while he sat frowning at his cigarette and sipping his
highball in troubled abstraction. At last he rose and walked to the
mantel, where he stood studying a C&eacute;zanne watercolor he had
given Markham years before. His action was a typical indication of
his inner puzzlement.</p>

<p>Presently, when there came a lull in the conversation, he turned
sharply and looked at Mannix.</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Mannix"&mdash;he spoke with only casual
curiosity&mdash;"how does it happen you've never acquired a taste
for poker? All good businessmen are gamblers at heart."</p>

<p>"Sure they are," Mannix replied, with pensive deliberation. "But
poker, now, isn't my idea of gambling&mdash;positively not. It's
got too much science. And it ain't quick enough for me&mdash;it
hasn't got the kick in it, if you know what I mean. Roulette's my
speed. When I was in Monte Carlo last summer, I dropped more money
in ten minutes than you gentlemen lost here this whole evening. But
I got action for my money."</p>

<p>"I take it, then, you don't care for cards at all."</p>

<p>"Not to play games with." Mannix had become expansive. "I don't
mind betting money on the draw of a card, for instance. But no two
out of three, y' understand. I want my pleasures to come rapid."
And he snapped his thick fingers several times in quick succession
to demonstrate the rapidity with which he desired to have his
pleasures come.</p>

<p>Vance sauntered to the table and carelessly picked up a deck of
cards. "What do you say to cutting once for a thousand
dollars?"</p>

<p>Mannix rose instantly. "You're on!"</p>

<p>Vance handed the cards over, and Mannix shuffled them. Then he
put them down and cut. He turned up a ten. Vance cut and showed a
king.</p>

<p>"A thousand I owe you," said Mannix, with no more concern than
if it had been ten cents.</p>

<p>Vance waited without speaking, and Mannix eyed him craftily.</p>

<p>"I'll cut with you again&mdash;two thousand this time. Yes?"</p>

<p>Vance raised his eyebrows. "Double?...By all means." He shuffled
the cards and cut a seven.</p>

<p>Mannix's hand swooped down and turned a five.</p>

<p>"Well, that's three thousand I owe you," he said. His little
eyes had now narrowed into slits, and he held his cigar clamped
tightly between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Like to double it again&mdash;eh, what?" Vance asked. "Four
thousand this time?"</p>

<p>Markham looked at Vance in amazement, and over Allen's face
there came an expression of almost ludicrous consternation.
Everyone present, I believe, was astonished at the offer, for
obviously Vance knew that he was giving Mannix tremendous odds by
permitting successive doubling. In the end he was sure to lose. I
believe Markham would have protested if at that moment Mannix had
not snatched the cards from the table and begun to shuffle
them.</p>

<p>"Four thousand it is!" he announced, putting down the deck and
cutting. He turned up the queen of diamonds. "You can't beat the
lady&mdash;positively not!" He was suddenly jovial.</p>

<p>"I fancy you're right," murmured Vance; and he cut a trey.</p>

<p>"Want some more?" asked Mannix, with good-natured
aggressiveness.</p>

<p>"That's enough." Vance seemed bored. "Far too excitin'. I
haven't your rugged constitution, don't y' know."</p>

<p>He went to the desk and made out a check to Mannix for a
thousand dollars. Then he turned to Markham and held out his hand.
"Had a jolly evening and all that sort of thing...And, don't
forget: we lunch together tomorrow. One o'clock at the club,
what?"</p>

<p>Markham hesitated. "If nothing interferes."</p>

<p>"But really, y' know, it mustn't," insisted Vance. "You've no
idea how eager you are to see me."</p>

<p>He was unusually silent and thoughtful during the ride home. Not
one explanatory word could I get out of him. But when he bade me
good night he said, "There's a vital part of the puzzle still
missing, and until it's found, none of it has any meaning."</p>

<h2>28 - THE GUILTY MAN</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 18; 1 P.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Vance slept late the following morning and spent the hour or so
before lunch checking a catalog of ceramics which were to be
auctioned next day at the Anderson Galleries. At one o'clock we
entered the Stuyvesant Club and joined Markham in the grill.</p>

<p>"The lunch is on you, old thing," said Vance. "But I'll make it
easy. All I want is a rasher of English bacon, a cup of coffee, and
a croissant."</p>

<p>Markham gave him a mocking smile.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you're economizing after your bad luck of last
night."</p>

<p>Vance's eyebrows went up. "I rather fancied my luck was most
extr'ordin'ry."</p>

<p>"You held four of a kind twice and lost both hands."</p>

<p>"But, y' see," blandly confessed Vance, "I happened to know both
times exactly what cards my opponents held."</p>

<p>Markham stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Quite so," Vance assured him. "I had arranged before the game,
d' ye see, to have those particular hands dealt." He smiled
benignly. "I can't tell you, old chap, how I admire your delicacy
in not referring to my rather unique guest, Mr. Allen, whom I had
the bad taste to introduce so unceremoniously into your party. I
owe you an explanation and an apology. Mr. Allen is not what one
would call a charming companion. He is deficient in the patrician
elegancies, and his display of jewelry was a bit
vulgar&mdash;though I infinitely preferred his diamond studs to his
piebald tie. But Mr. Allen has his points&mdash;decidedly he has
his points. He ranks with Andy Blakely, Canfield, and Honest John
Kelly as an indoor soldier of fortune. In fact, our Mr. Allen is
none other than Doc Wiley Allen, of fragrant memory."</p>

<p>"Doc Allen! Not the notorious old crook who ran the Eldorado
Club?"</p>

<p>"The same. And, incidentally, one of the cleverest card
manipulators in a once lucrative but shady profession."</p>

<p>"You mean this fellow Allen stacked the cards last night?"
Markham was indignant.</p>

<p>"Only for the two hands you mentioned. Allen, if you happen to
remember, was the dealer both times. I, who purposely sat on his
right, was careful to cut the cards in accordance with his
instructions. And you really must admit that no stricture can
possibly attach to my deception, inasmuch as the only beneficiaries
of Allen's manipulations were Cleaver and Spotswoode. Although
Allen did deal me four of a kind on each occasion, I lost heavily
both times."</p>

<p>Markham regarded Vance for a moment in puzzled silence and then
laughed good-naturedly. "You appear to have been in a philanthropic
mood last night. You practically gave Mannix a thousand dollars by
permitting him to double the stakes on each draw. A rather quixotic
procedure, I should say."</p>

<p>"It all depends on one's point of view, don't y' know. Despite
my financial losses&mdash;which, by the bye, I have every intention
of charging up to your office budget&mdash;the game was most
successful...Y' see, I attained the main object of my evening's
entertainment."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember!" said Markham vaguely, as if the matter, being
of slight importance, had for the moment eluded his memory. "I
believe you were going to ascertain who murdered the Odell
girl."</p>

<p>"Amazin' memory!...Yes, I let fall the hint that I might be able
to clarify the situation today."</p>

<p>"And whom am I to arrest?"</p>

<p>Vance took a drink of coffee and slowly lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I'm quite convinced, y' know, that you won't believe me," he
returned in an even, matter-of-fact voice. "But it was Spotswoode
who killed the girl."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me!" Markham spoke with undisguised irony. "So
it was Spotswoode! My dear Vance, you positively bowl me over. I
would telephone Heath at once to polish up his handcuffs, but,
unfortunately, miracles&mdash;such as strangling persons from
across town&mdash;are not recognized possibilities in this day and
age...Do let me order you another croissant."</p>

<p>Vance extended his hands in a theatrical gesture of exasperated
despair. "For an educated, civilized man, Markham, there's
something downright primitive about the way you cling to optical
illusions. I say, y' know, you're exactly like an infant who really
believes that the magician generates a rabbit in a silk hat, simply
because he sees it done."</p>

<p>"Now you're becoming insulting."</p>

<p>"Rather!" Vance pleasantly agreed. "But something drastic must
be done to disentangle you from the Lorelei of legal facts. You're
so deficient in imagination, old thing."</p>

<p>"I take it that you would have me close my eyes and picture
Spotswoode sitting upstairs here in the Stuyvesant Club and
extending his arms to 71st Street. But I simply couldn't do it. I'm
a commonplace chap. Such a vision would strike me as ludicrous; it
would smack of a hasheesh dream...You yourself don't use
<i>Cannabis indica,</i> do you?"</p>

<p>"Put that way, the idea does sound a bit supernatural. And yet:
<i>Certum est quia impossibile est.</i> I rather like that maxim,
don't y' know; for, in the present case, the impossible is true.
Oh, Spotswoode's guilty&mdash;no doubt about it. And I'm going to
cling tenaciously to that apparent hallucination. Moreover, I'm
going to try to lure you into its toils; for your own&mdash;as we
absurdly say&mdash;good name is at stake. As it happens, Markham,
you are at this moment shielding the real murderer from
publicity."</p>

<p>Vance had spoken with the easy assurance that precludes
argument; and from the altered expression on Markham's face I could
see he was moved.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "how you arrived at your fantastic belief in
Spotswoode's guilt."</p>

<p>Vance crushed out his cigarette and folded his arms on the
table.</p>

<p>"We begin with my quartet of possibilities&mdash;Mannix,
Cleaver, Lindquist, and Spotswoode. Realizing, as I did, that the
crime was carefully planned with the sole object of murder, I knew
that only someone hopelessly ensnared in the lady's net could have
done it. And no suitor outside of my quartet could have been thus
enmeshed, or we would have learned of him. Therefore, one of the
four was guilty. Now, Lindquist was eliminated when we found out
that he was bedridden in a hospital at the time of Skeel's murder;
for obviously the same person committed both crimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," interrupted Markham, "Spotswoode had an equally good
alibi for the night of the Canary's murder. Why eliminate one and
not the other?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, but I can't agree with you. Being prostrated at a known
place surrounded by incorruptible and disinterested witnesses, both
preceding and during an event, is one thing; but being actually on
the ground, as Spotswoode was that fatal evening, within a few
minutes of the time the lady was murdered, and then being alone in
a taxicab for fifteen minutes or so following the event&mdash;that
is another thing. No one, as far as we know, actually saw the lady
alive after Spotswoode took his departure."</p>

<p>"But the proof of her having been alive and spoken to him is
incontestable."</p>

<p>"Granted. I admit that a dead woman doesn't scream and call for
help and then converse with her murderer."</p>

<p>"I see." Markham spoke with sarcasm. "You think it was Skeel,
disguising his voice."</p>

<p>"Lord no! What a priceless notion! Skeel didn't want anyone to
know he was there. Why should he have staged such a masterpiece of
idiocy? That certainly isn't the explanation. When we find the
answer it will be reasonable and simple."</p>

<p>"That's encouraging," smiled Markham. "But proceed with your
reason for Spotswoode's guilt."</p>

<p>"Three of my quartet, then, were potential murderers," Vance
resumed. "Accordingly, I requested an evening of social relaxation,
that I might put them under the psychological microscope, as it
were. Although Spotswoode's ancestry was wholly consistent with his
having been the guilty one, nevertheless I confess I thought that
Cleaver or Mannix had committed the crime; for, by their own
statements, either of them could have done it without contradicting
any of the known circumstances of the situation. Therefore, when
Mannix declined your invitation to play poker last night, I put
Cleaver to the first test. I wig-wagged to Mr. Allen, and he
straightway proceeded to perform his first feat of
prestidigitation."</p>

<p>Vance paused and looked up.</p>

<p>"You perhaps recall the circumstances? It was a jackpot. Allen
dealt Cleaver a four-straight-flush and gave me three kings. The
other hands were so poor that everyone else was compelled to drop
out. I opened, and Cleaver stayed. On the draw, Allen gave me
another king, and gave Cleaver the card he needed to complete his
straight-flush. Twice I bet a small amount, and each time Cleaver
raised me. Finally I called him, and, of course, he won. He
couldn't help but win d' ye see. He was betting on a sure thing.
Since I opened the pot and drew two cards, the highest hand I could
possibly have held would have been four of a kind. Cleaver knew
this, and having a straight-flush, he also knew, before he raised
my bet, that he had me beaten. At once I realized that he was not
the man I was after."</p>

<p>"By what reasoning?"</p>

<p>"A poker player, Markham, who would bet on a sure thing is one
who lacks the egotistical self-confidence of the highly subtle and
supremely capable gambler. He is not a man who will take hazardous
chances and tremendous risks, for he possesses, to some degree,
what the psychoanalysts call an inferiority complex, and
instinctively he grasps at every possible opportunity of protecting
and bettering himself. In short, he is not the ultimate,
unadulterated gambler. And the man who killed the Odell girl was a
supreme gambler who would stake everything on a single turn of the
wheel, for, in killing her, that is exactly what he did. And only a
gambler whose paramount self-confidence would make him scorn,
through sheer egotism, to bet on a sure thing, could have committed
such a crime. Therefore, Cleaver was eliminated as a suspect."</p>

<p>Markham was now listening intently.</p>

<p>"The test to which I put Spotswoode a little later," Vance went
on, "had originally been intended for Mannix, but he was out of the
game. That didn't matter, however, for, had I been able to
eliminate both Cleaver and Spotswoode, then Mannix would
undoubtedly have been the guilty man. Of course I would have
planned something else to substantiate the fact; but, as it was,
that wasn't necessary...The test I applied to Spotswoode was pretty
well explained by the gentleman himself. As he said, not one player
in a thousand would have wagered the limit against a pat hand, when
he himself held nothing. It was tremendous&mdash;superb! It was
probably the most remarkable bluff ever made in a game of poker. I
couldn't help admiring him when he calmly shoved forward all his
chips, knowing, as I did, that he held nothing. He staked
everything, d' ye see, wholly on his conviction that he could
follow my reasoning step by step and, in the last analysis, outwit
me. It took courage and daring to do that. And it also took a
degree of self-confidence which would never have permitted him to
bet on a sure thing. The psychological principles involved in that
hand were identical with those of the Odell crime. I threatened
Spotswoode with a powerful hand&mdash;a pat hand&mdash;just as the
girl, no doubt, threatened him; and instead of
compromising&mdash;instead of calling me or laying down&mdash;he
outreached me; he resorted to one supreme coup, though it meant
risking everything...My word, Markham! Can't you see how the man's
character, as revealed in that amazing gesture, dovetails with the
psychology of the crime?"</p>

<p>Markham was silent for a while; he appeared to be pondering the
matter. "But you yourself, Vance, were not satisfied at the time,"
he submitted at length. "In fact, you looked doubtful and
worried."</p>

<p>"True, old dear. I was no end worried. The psychological proof
of Spotswoode's guilt came so dashed unexpectedly&mdash;I wasn't
looking for it, don't y' know. After eliminating Cleaver I had a
<i>parti pris,</i> so to speak, in regard to Mannix; for all the
material evidence in favor of Spotswoode's innocence&mdash;that is,
the seeming physical impossibility of his having strangled the
lady&mdash;had, I admit, impressed me. I'm not perfect, don't y'
know. Being unfortunately human, I'm still susceptible to the
malicious animal magnetism about facts and appearances, which you
lawyer chaps are continuously exuding over the earth like some vast
asphyxiating effluvium. And even when I found that Spotswoode's
psychological nature fitted perfectly with all the factors of the
crime, I still harbored a doubt in regard to Mannix. It was barely
possible that he would have played the hand just as Spotswoode
played it. That is why, after the game was over, I tackled him on
the subject of gambling. I wanted to check his psychological
reactions."</p>

<p>"Still, he staked everything on one turn of the wheel, as you
put it."</p>

<p>"Ah! But not in the same sense that Spotswoode did. Mannix is a
cautious and timid gambler as compared with Spotswoode. To begin
with, he had an equal chance and an even bet, whereas Spotswoode
had no chance at all&mdash;his hand was worthless. And yet
Spotswoode wagered the limit on a pure bit of mental calculation.
That was gambling in the higher ether. On the other hand, Mannix
was merely tossing a coin, with an even chance of winning.
Furthermore, no calculation of any kind entered into it; there was
no planning, no figuring, no daring. And, as I have told you from
the start, the Odell murder was premeditated and carefully worked
out with shrewd calculation and supreme daring... And what true
gambler would ask an adversary to double a bet on the second flip
of the coin, and then accept an offer to redouble on the third
flip? I purposely tested Mannix in that way, so as to preclude any
possibility of error. Thus I not only eliminated him, I expunged
him, eradicated him, wiped him out utterly. It cost me a thousand
dollars, but it purged my mind of any lingering doubt. I then knew,
despite all the contr'ry material indications, that Spotswoode had
done away with the lady."</p>

<p>"You make your case theoretically plausible. But, practically,
I'm afraid I can't accept it." Markham was more impressed, I felt,
than he cared to admit. "Damn it, man!" he exploded after a moment.
"Your conclusion demolishes all the established landmarks of
rationality and sane credibility.&mdash;Just consider the facts."
He had now reached the argumentative stage of his doubt. "You say
Spotswoode is guilty. Yet we know, on irrefutable evidence, that
five minutes after he came out of the apartment, the girl screamed
and called for help. He was standing by the switchboard, and,
accompanied by Jessup, he went to the door and carried on a brief
conversation with her. She was certainly alive then. Then he went
out the front door, entered a taxicab, and drove away. Fifteen
minutes later he was joined by Judge Redfern as he alighted from
the taxicab in front of the club here&mdash;nearly forty blocks
away from the apartment house! It would have been impossible for
him to have made the trip in less time; and, moreover, we have the
chauffeur's record. Spotswoode simply did not have either the
opportunity or the time to commit the murder between half past
eleven and ten minutes of twelve, when Judge Redfern met him. And,
remember, he played poker in the club here until three in the
morning&mdash;hours after the murder took place."</p>

<p>Markham shook his head with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Vance, there's no human way to get round those facts. They're
firmly established; and they preclude Spotswoode's guilt as
effectively and finally as though he had been at the North Pole
that night."</p>

<p>Vance was unmoved.</p>

<p>"I admit everything you say," he rejoined. "But as I have stated
before, when material facts and psychological facts conflict, the
material facts are wrong. In this case, they may not actually be
wrong, but they're deceptive."</p>

<p>"Very well, <i>magnus Apollo!"</i> The situation was too much
for Markham's exacerbated nerves. "Show me how Spotswoode could
have strangled the girl and ransacked the apartment, and I'll order
Heath to arrest him."</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, I can't do it," expostulated Vance. "Omniscience
was denied me. But&mdash;deuce take it!&mdash;I think I've done
rather well in pointing out the culprit. I never agreed to expound
his technic, don't y' know."</p>

<p>"So! Your vaunted penetration amounts only to that, does it?
Well, well! Here and now I become a professor of the higher mental
sciences, and I pronounce solemnly that Doctor Crippen murdered the
Odell girl. To be sure, Crippen's dead; but that fact doesn't
interfere with my newly adopted psychological means of deduction.
Crippen's nature, you see, fits perfectly with all the esoteric and
recondite indications of the crime. Tomorrow I'll apply for an
order of exhumation."</p>

<p>Vance looked at him with waggish reproachfulness and sighed.
"Recognition of my transcendent genius, I see, is destined to be
posthumous. <i>Omnia post obitum fingit majora vetustas.</i> In the
meantime I bear the taunts and jeers of the multitude with a stout
heart. 'My head is bloody, but unbowed.'"</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and then seemed to become absorbed with
some line of thought.</p>

<p>"Markham," he said, after several minutes, "I've a concert at
three o'clock, but there's an hour to spare. I want to take another
look at that apartment and its various approaches. Spotswoode's
trick&mdash;and I'm convinced it was nothing more than a
trick&mdash;was enacted there; and if we are ever to find the
explanation, we shall have to look for it on the scene."</p>

<p>I had got the impression that Markham, despite his emphatic
denial of the possibility of Spotswoode's guilt, was not entirely
unconvinced. Therefore, I was not surprised when, with only a
halfhearted protest, he assented to Vance's proposal to revisit the
Odell apartment.</p>

<h2>29 - BEETHOVEN'S "ANDANTE"</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 18; 2 P.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>Less than half an hour later we again entered the main hall of
the little apartment building in 71st Street. Spively, as usual,
was on duty at the switchboard. Just inside the public reception
room the officer on guard reclined in an easy chair, a cigar in his
mouth. On seeing the district attorney, he rose with forced
alacrity.</p>

<p>"When you going to open things up, Mr. Markham?" he asked. "This
rest cure is ruinin' my health."</p>

<p>"Very soon, I hope, Officer," Markham told him. "Any more
visitors?"</p>

<p>"Nobody, sir." The man stifled a yawn.</p>

<p>"Let's have your key to the apartment. Have you been
inside?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Orders were to stay out here."</p>

<p>We passed into the dead girl's living room. The shades were
still up, and the sunlight of midday was pouring in. Nothing
apparently had been touched; not even the overturned chairs had
been righted. Markham went to the window and stood, his hands
behind him, surveying the scene despondently. He was laboring under
a growing uncertainty, and he watched Vance with a cynical
amusement which was far from spontaneous.</p>

<p>Vance, after lighting a cigarette, proceeded to inspect the two
rooms, letting his eyes rest searchingly on the various disordered
objects. Presently he went into the bathroom and remained several
minutes. When he came out he carried a towel with several dark
smudges on it.</p>

<p>"This is what Skeel used to erase his fingerprints," he said,
tossing the towel on the bed.</p>

<p>"Marvelous!" Markham rallied him. "That, of course, convicts
Spotswoode."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! But it helps substantiate my theory of the crime." He
walked to the dressing table and sniffed at a tiny silver atomizer.
"The lady used Coty's Chypre," he murmured. "Why <i>will</i> they
all do it?"</p>

<p>"And just what does that help substantiate?"</p>

<p>"Markham dear, I'm absorbing atmosphere. I'm attuning my soul to
the apartment's vibrations. Do let me attune in peace. I may have a
visitation at any moment&mdash;a revelation from Sinai, as it
were."</p>

<p>He continued his round of investigation and at last passed out
into the main hall, where he stood, one foot holding open the door,
looking about him with curious intentness. When he returned to the
living room, he sat down on the edge of the rosewood table and
surrendered himself to gloomy contemplation. After several minutes
he gave Markham a sardonic grin.</p>

<p>"I say! This <i>is</i> a problem. Dash it all, it's
uncanny!"</p>

<p>"I had an idea," scoffed Markham, "that sooner or later you'd
revise your deductions in regard to Spotswoode."</p>

<p>Vance stared idly at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"You're devilish stubborn, don't y' know. Here I am trying to
extricate you from a deuced unpleasant predicament, and all you do
is to indulge in caustic observations calculated to damp my
youthful ardor."</p>

<p>Markham left the window and seated himself on the arm of the
davenport facing Vance. His eyes held a worried look.</p>

<p>"Vance, don't get me wrong. Spotswoode means nothing in my life.
If he did this thing, I'd like to know it. Unless this case is
cleared up, I'm in for an ungodly walloping by the newspapers. It's
not to my interests to discourage any possibility of a solution.
But your conclusion about Spotswoode is impossible. There are too
many contradictory facts."</p>

<p>"That's just it, don't y' know. The contradic'try indications
are far too perfect. They fit together too beautifully; they're
almost as fine as the forms in a Michelangelo statue. They're too
carefully coordinated, d' ye see, to have been merely a haphazard
concatenation of circumstances. They signify conscious design."</p>

<p>Markham rose and, slowly returning to the window, stood looking
out into the little rear yard.</p>

<p>"If I could grant your premise that Spotswoode killed the girl,"
he said, "I could follow your syllogism. But I can't very well
convict a man on the grounds that his defense is too perfect."</p>

<p>"What we need, Markham, is inspiration. The mere contortions of
the sibyl are not enough." Vance took a turn up and down the room.
"What really infuriates me is that I've been outwitted. And by a
manufacturer of automobile access'ries!...It's most
humiliatin'."</p>

<p>He sat down at the piano and played the opening bars of Brahms's
Capriccio No. 1. "Needs tuning," he muttered; and, sauntering to
the Boule cabinet, he ran his finger over the marquetry. "Pretty
and all that," he said, "but a bit fussy. Good example, though. The
deceased's aunt from Seattle should get a very fair price for it."
He regarded a pendent girandole at the side of the cabinet. "Rather
nice, that, if the original candles hadn't been supplanted with
modern frosted bulbs." He paused before the little china clock on
the mantel. "Gingerbread. I'm sure it kept atrocious time." Passing
on to the escritoire, he examined it critically. "Imitation French
Renaissance. But rather dainty, what?" Then his eye fell on the
wastepaper basket, and he picked it up. "Silly idea," he commented,
"&mdash;making a basket out of vellum. The artistic triumph of some
lady interior decorator, I'll wager. Enough vellum here to bind a
set of Epictetus. But why ruin the effect with hand-painted
garlands? The aesthetic instinct has not as yet invaded these fair
States&mdash;decidedly not."</p>

<p>Setting the basket down, he studied it meditatively for a
moment. Then he leaned over and took from it the piece of crumpled
wrapping paper to which he had referred the previous day.</p>

<p>"This doubtless contained the lady's last purchase on earth," he
mused. "Very touchin'. Are you sentimental about such trifles,
Markham? Anyway, the purple string round it was a godsend to
Skeel...What knickknack, do you suppose, paved the way for the
frantic Tony's escape?"</p>

<p>He opened the paper, revealing a broken piece of corrugated
cardboard and a large square dark-brown envelope.</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure! Phonograph records." He glanced about the
apartment. "But, I say, where did the lady keep the bally
machine?"</p>

<p>"You'll find it in the foyer," said Markham wearily, without
turning. He knew that Vance's chatter was only the outward
manifestation of serious and perplexed thinking; and he was waiting
with what patience he could muster.</p>

<p>Vance sauntered idly through the glass doors into the little
reception hall, and stood gazing abstractedly at a console
phonograph of Chinese Chippendale design which stood against the
wall at one end. The squat cabinet was partly covered with a prayer
rug, and upon it sat a polished bronze flower bowl.</p>

<p>"At any rate, it doesn't look phonographic," he remarked. "But
why the prayer rug?" He examined it casually.
"Anatolian&mdash;probably called a Caesarian for sale purposes. Not
very valuable&mdash;too much on the Oushak type...Wonder what the
lady's taste in music was. Victor Herbert, doubtless." He turned
back the rug and lifted the lid of the cabinet. There was a record
already on the machine, and he leaned over and looked at it.</p>

<p>"My word! The Andante from Beethoven's C-Minor Symphony!" he
exclaimed cheerfully. "You know the movement, of course, Markham.
The most perfect Andante ever written." He wound up the machine. "I
think a little music might clear the atmosphere and volatilize our
perturbation, what?"</p>

<p>Markham paid no attention to his banter; he was still gazing
dejectedly out of the window.</p>

<p>Vance started the motor, and placing the needle on the record,
returned to the living room. He stood staring at the davenport,
concentrating on the problem in hand. I sat in the wicker chair by
the door waiting for the music. The situation was getting on my
nerves, and I began to feel fidgety. A minute or two passed, but
the only sound which came from the phonograph was a faint
scratching. Vance looked up with mild curiosity, and walked back to
the machine. Inspecting it cursorily, he once more set it in
operation. But though he waited several minutes, no music came
forth.</p>

<p>"I say! That's deuced queer, y' know," he grumbled, as he
changed the needle and rewound the motor.</p>

<p>Markham had now left the window and stood watching him with
good-natured tolerance. The turntable of the phonograph was
spinning, and the needle was tracing its concentric revolutions;
but still the instrument refused to play. Vance, with both hands on
the cabinet, was leaning forward, his eyes fixed on the silently
revolving record with an expression of amused bewilderment.</p>

<p>"The sound box is probably broken," he said. "Silly machines,
anyway."</p>

<p>"The difficulty, I imagine," Markham chided him, "lies in your
patrician ignorance of so vulgar and democratic a mechanism. Permit
me to assist you."</p>

<p>He moved to Vance's side, and I stood looking curiously over his
shoulder. Everything appeared to be in order, and the needle had
now almost reached the end of the record. But only a faint
scratching was audible.</p>

<p>Markham stretched forth his hand to lift the sound box. But his
movement was never completed.</p>

<p>At that moment the little apartment was filled with several
terrifying treble screams, followed by two shrill calls for help. A
cold chill swept my body, and there was a tingling at the roots of
my hair.</p>

<p>After a short silence, during which the three of us remained
speechless, the same feminine voice said in a loud, distinct tone:
<i>"No; nothing is the matter. I'm sorry.</i>...<i>Everything is
all right...Please go home, and don't worry."</i></p>

<p>The needle had come to the end of the record. There was a slight
click, and the automatic device shut off the motor. The almost
terrifying silence that followed was broken by a sardonic chuckle
from Vance.</p>

<p>"Well, old dear," he remarked languidly, as he strolled back
into the living room, "so much for your irrefutable facts!"</p>

<p>There came a loud knocking on the door, and the officer on duty
outside looked in with a startled face.</p>

<p>"It's all right," Markham informed him in a husky voice. "I'll
call you when I want you."</p>

<p>Vance lay down on the davenport and took out another cigarette.
Having lighted it, he stretched his arms far over his head and
extended his legs, like a man in whom a powerful physical tension
had suddenly relaxed.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, Markham, we've all been babes in the woods," he
drawled. "An incontrovertible alibi&mdash;my word! If the law
supposes that, as Mr. Bumble said, the law is a ass, a
idiot.&mdash;Oh, Sammy, Sammy, vy worn't there a
alleybi!...Markham, I blush to admit it, but it's you and I who've
been the unutterable asses."</p>

<p>Markham had been standing by the instrument like a man dazed,
his eyes riveted hypnotically on the telltale record. Slowly he
came into the room and threw himself wearily into a chair.</p>

<p>"Those precious facts of yours!" continued Vance. "Stripped of
their carefully disguised appearance, what are
they?&mdash;Spotswoode prepared a phonograph record&mdash;a simple
enough task. Everyone makes 'em nowadays&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. He told me he had a workshop at his home on Long Island
where he tinkered a bit."</p>

<p>"He really didn't need it, y' know. But it facilitated things,
no doubt. The voice on the record is merely his own in
falsetto&mdash;better for the purpose than a woman's, for it's
stronger and more penetrating. As for the label, he simply soaked
it off an ordin'ry record, and pasted it on his own. He brought the
lady several new records that night, and concealed this one among
them. After the theater he enacted his gruesome little drama and
then carefully set the stage so that the police would think it was
a typical burglar's performance. When this had been done, he placed
the record on the machine, set it going, and calmly walked out. He
had placed the prayer rug and bronze bowl on the cabinet of the
machine to give the impression that the phonograph was rarely used.
And the precaution worked, for no one thought of looking into it.
Why should they?...Then he asked Jessup to call a
taxicab&mdash;everything quite natural, y' see. While he was
waiting for the car the needle reached the recorded screams. They
were heard plainly: it was night, and the sounds carried
distinctly. Moreover, being filtered through a wooden door, their
phonographic timbre was well disguised. And, if you'll note, the
enclosed horn is directed toward the door, not three feet
away."</p>

<p>"But the synchronization of his questions and the answers on the
record...?"</p>

<p>"The simplest part of it. You remember Jessup told us that
Spotswoode was standing with one arm on the switchboard when the
screams were heard. He merely had his eye on his wristwatch. The
moment he heard the cry, he calculated the intermission on the
record and put his question to the imagin'ry lady at just the right
moment to receive the record's response. It was all carefully
figured out beforehand; he no doubt rehearsed it in his laborat'ry.
It was deuced simple, and practically proof against failure. The
record is a large one&mdash;twelve-inch diameter, I should
say&mdash;and it requires about five minutes for the needle to
traverse it. By putting the screams at the end, he allowed himself
ample time to get out and order a taxicab. When the car at last
came, he rode direct to the Stuyvesant Club, where he met Judge
Redfern and played poker till three. If he hadn't met the judge,
rest assured he would have impressed his presence on someone else
so as to have established an alibi."</p>

<p>Markham shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"Good God! No wonder he importuned me on every possible occasion
to let him visit this apartment again. Such a damning piece of
evidence as that record must have kept him awake at night."</p>

<p>"Still, I rather fancy that if I hadn't discovered it, he would
have succeeded in getting possession of it as soon as your
<i>sergent-de-ville</i> was removed. It was annoyin' to be
unexpectedly barred from the apartment, but I doubt if it worried
him much. He would have been on hand when the Canary's aunt took
possession, and the retrieving of the record would have been
comparatively easy. Of course the record constituted a hazard, but
Spotswoode isn't the type who'd shy at a low bunker of that kind.
No, the thing was planned scientifically enough. He was defeated by
sheer accident."</p>

<p>"And Skeel?"</p>

<p>"He was another unfortunate circumstance. He was hiding in the
closet there when Spotswoode and the lady came in at eleven. It was
Spotswoode whom he saw strangle his erstwhile <i>amoureuse</i> and
rifle the apartment. Then, when Spotswoode went out, he came forth
from hiding. He was probably looking down at the girl when the
phonograph emitted its blood-chilling wails...My word! Fancy being
in a cold funk, gazing at a murdered woman, and then hearing
piercing screams behind you! It was a bit too much even for the
hardened Tony. I don't wonder he forgot all caution and put his
hand on the table to steady himself...And then came Spotswoode's
voice through the door, and the record's answer. This must have
puzzled Skeel. I imagine he thought for a moment he'd lost his
reason. But pretty soon the significance of it dawned on him; and I
can see him grinning to himself. Obviously he knew who the murderer
was&mdash;it would not have been in keeping with his character had
he failed to learn the identities of the Canary's admirers. And now
there had fallen into his lap, like manna from heaven, the most
perfect opportunity for blackmail that any such charmin' young
gentleman could desire. He doubtless indulged himself with roseate
visions of a life of opulence and ease at Spotswoode's expense.
When Cleaver phoned a few minutes later, he merely said the lady
was out, and then set to work planning his own departure."</p>

<p>"But I don't see why he didn't take the record with him."</p>

<p>"And remove from the scene of the crime the one piece of
unanswerable evidence?...Bad strategy, Markham. If he himself had
produced the record later, Spotswoode would simply have denied all
knowledge of it, and accused the blackmailer of a plot. Oh, no;
Skeel's only course was to leave it and apply for an enormous
settlement from Spotswoode at once. And I imagine that's what he
did. Spotswoode no doubt gave him something on account and promised
him the rest anon, hoping in the meantime to retrieve the record.
When he failed to pay, Skeel phoned you and threatened to tell
everything, thinking to spur Spotswoode to action...Well, he
spurred him&mdash;but not to the action desired. Spotswoode
probably met him by appointment last Saturday night, ostensibly to
hand over the money, but instead, throttled the chap. Quite in
keeping with his nature, don't y' know...Stout fella,
Spotswoode."</p>

<p>"The whole thing...it's amazing."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't say that, now. Spotswoode had an unpleasant task to
perform and he set about it in a cool, logical, forthright,
businesslike manner. He had decided that his little Canary must die
for his peace of mind; she'd probably made herself most annoyin'.
So he arranged the date&mdash;like any judge passing sentence on a
prisoner at the bar&mdash;and then proceeded to fabricate an alibi.
Being something of a mechanic, he arranged a mechanical alibi. The
device he chose was simple and obvious enough&mdash;no tortuosities
or complications. And it would have succeeded but for what the
insurance companies piously call an act of God. No one can foresee
accidents, Markham; they wouldn't be accidental if one could. But
Spotswoode certainly took every precaution that was humanly
possible. It never occurred to him that you would thwart his every
effort to return here and confiscate the record; and he couldn't
anticipate my taste in music, nor know that I would seek solace in
the tonal art. Furthermore, when one calls on a lady, one doesn't
expect that another suitor is going to hide himself in the clothes
press. It isn't done, don't y' know...All in all, the poor johnny
was beaten by a run of abominable luck."</p>

<p>"You overlook the fiendishness of the crime," Markham reproached
him tartly.</p>

<p>"Don't be so confoundedly moral, old thing. Everyone's a
murderer at heart. The person who has never felt a passionate
hankering to kill someone is without emotions. And do you think
it's ethics or theology that stays the average person from
homicide? Dear no! It's lack of courage&mdash;the fear of being
found out, or haunted, or cursed with remorse. Observe with what
delight the people <i>en masse</i>&mdash;to wit, the
state&mdash;put men to death and then gloat over it in the
newspapers. Nations declare war against one another on the
slightest provocation, so they can, with immunity, vent their lust
for slaughter. Spotswoode, I'd say, is merely a rational animal
with the courage of his convictions."</p>

<p>"Society unfortunately isn't ready for your nihilistic
philosophy just yet," said Markham. "And during the intervening
transition human life must be protected."</p>

<p>He rose resolutely and, going to the telephone, called up
Heath.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," he ordered, "get a John-Doe warrant and meet me
immediately at the Stuyvesant Club. Bring a man with
you&mdash;there's an arrest to be made."</p>

<p>"At last the law has evidence after its own heart," chirped
Vance, as he lazily donned his topcoat and picked up his hat and
stick. "What a grotesque affair your legal procedure is, Markham!
Scientific knowledge&mdash;the facts of psychology&mdash;mean
nothing to you learned Solons. But a phonograph record&mdash;ah!
There, now, is something convincing, irrefragable, final,
what?"</p>

<p>On our way out Markham beckoned to the officer on guard. "Under
no conditions," he said, "is anyone to enter this apartment until I
return&mdash;not even with a signed permit."</p>

<p>When we had entered the taxicab, he directed the chauffeur to
the club.</p>

<p>"So the newspapers want action, do they? Well, they're going to
get it...You've helped me out of a nasty hole, old man."</p>

<p>As he spoke, his eyes turned to Vance. And that look conveyed a
profounder gratitude than any words could have expressed.</p>

<h2>30 - THE END</h2>

<p><i>(Tuesday, September 18; 3:30 P.M.)</i>
</p>

<p>It was exactly half past three when we entered the rotunda of
the Stuyvesant Club. Markham at once sent for the manager and held
a few words of private conversation with him. The manager then
hastened away and was gone about five minutes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Spotswoode is in his rooms," he informed Markham, on
returning. "I sent the electrician up to test the light bulbs. He
reports that the gentleman is alone, writing at his desk."</p>

<p>"And the room number?"</p>

<p>"Three forty-one." The manager appeared perturbed. "There won't
be any fuss, will there, Mr. Markham?"</p>

<p>"I don't look for any." Markham's tone was chilly. "However, the
present matter is considerably more important than your club."</p>

<p>"What an exaggerated point of view!" sighed Vance when the
manager had left us. "The arrest of Spotswoode, I'd say, was the
acme of futility. The man isn't a criminal, don't y' know; he has
nothing in common with Lombroso's <i>Uomo Delinquente.</i> He's
what one might term a philosophic behaviorist."</p>

<p>Markham grunted but did not answer. He began pacing up and down
agitatedly, keeping his eyes expectantly on the main entrance.
Vance sought a comfortable chair and settled himself in it with
placid unconcern.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Heath and Snitkin arrived. Markham at once led
them into an alcove and briefly explained his reason for summoning
them.</p>

<p>"Spotswoode's upstairs now," he said. "I want the arrest made as
quietly as possible."</p>

<p>"Spotswoode!" Heath repeated the name in astonishment. "I don't
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't have to see&mdash;yet," Markham cut in sharply. "I'm
taking all responsibility for the arrest. And you're getting the
credit&mdash;if you want it. That suit you?"</p>

<p>Heath shrugged his shoulders. "It's all right with me...anything
you say, sir." He shook his head uncomprehendingly. "But what about
Jessup?"</p>

<p>"We'll keep him locked up. Material witness."</p>

<p>We ascended in the elevator and emerged at the third floor.
Spotswoode's rooms were at the end of the hall, facing the Square.
Markham, his face set grimly, led the way.</p>

<p>In answer to his knock Spotswoode opened the door and, greeting
us pleasantly, stepped aside for us to enter.</p>

<p>"Any news yet?" he asked, moving a chair forward.</p>

<p>At this moment he got a clear view of Markham's face in the
light, and at once he sensed the minatory nature of our visit.
Though his expression did not alter, I saw his body suddenly go
taut. His cold, indecipherable eyes moved slowly from Markham's
face to Heath and Snitkin. Then his gaze fell on Vance and me, who
were standing a little behind the others, and he nodded
stiffly.</p>

<p>No one spoke; yet I felt that an entire tragedy was somehow
being enacted, and that each actor heard and understood every
word.</p>

<p>Markham remained standing, as if reluctant to proceed. Of all
the duties of his office, I knew that the arrest of malefactors was
the most distasteful to him. He was a worldly man, with the worldly
man's tolerance for the misfortunes of evil. Heath and Snitkin had
stepped forward and now waited with passive alertness for the
district attorney's order to serve the warrant.</p>

<p>Spotswoode's eyes were again on Markham. "What can I do for you,
sir?" His voice was calm and without the faintest quaver.</p>

<p>"You can accompany these officers, Mr. Spotswoode," Markham told
him quietly, with a slight inclination of his head toward the two
imperturbable figures at his side. "I arrest you for the murder of
Margaret Odell."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Spotswoode's eyebrows lifted mildly. "Then you
have&mdash;discovered something?"</p>

<p>"The Beethoven Andante."</p>

<p>Not a muscle of Spotswoode's face moved; but after a short pause
he made a barely perceptible gesture of resignation. "I can't say
that it was wholly unexpected," he said evenly, with the tragic
suggestion of a smile; "especially as you thwarted every effort of
mine to secure the record. But then...the fortunes of the game are
always uncertain." His smile faded, and his manner became grave.
"You have acted generously toward me, Mr. Markham, in shielding me
from the <i>canaille;</i> and because I appreciate that courtesy I
should like you to know that the game I played was one in which I
had no alternative."</p>

<p>"Your motive, however powerful," said Markham, "cannot extenuate
your crime."</p>

<p>"Do you think I seek extenuation?" Spotswoode dismissed the
imputation with a contemptuous gesture. "I'm not a schoolboy. I
calculated the consequences of my course of action and, after
weighing the various factors involved, decided to risk it. It was a
gamble, to be sure; but it's not my habit to complain about the
misfortunes of a deliberately planned risk. Furthermore, the choice
was practically forced upon me. Had I not gambled in this instance,
I stood to lose heavily nevertheless."</p>

<p>His face grew bitter.</p>

<p>"This woman, Mr. Markham, had demanded the impossible of me. Not
content with bleeding me financially, she demanded legal
protection, position, social prestige&mdash;such things as only my
name could give her. She informed me I must divorce my wife and
marry her. I wonder if you apprehend the enormity of that
demand?...You see, Mr. Markham, I love my wife, and I have children
whom I love. I will not insult your intelligence by explaining how,
despite my conduct, such a thing is entirely possible...And yet,
this woman commanded me to wreck my life and crush utterly those I
held dear, solely to gratify her petty, ridiculous ambition! When I
refused, she threatened to expose our relations to my wife, to send
her copies of the letters I had written, to sue me
publicly&mdash;in fine, to create such a scandal that, in any
event, my life would be ruined, my family disgraced, my home
destroyed."</p>

<p>He paused and drew a deep inspiration.</p>

<p>"I have never been partial to halfway measures," he continued
impassively. "I have no talent for compromise. Perhaps I am a
victim of my heritage. But my instinct is to play out a hand to the
last chip&mdash;to force whatever danger threatens. And for just
five minutes, a week ago, I understood how the fanatics of old
could, with a calm mind and a sense of righteousness, torture their
enemies who threatened them with spiritual destruction...I chose
the only course which might save those I love from disgrace and
suffering. It meant taking a desperate risk. But the blood within
me was such that I did not hesitate, and I was fired by the agony
of a tremendous hate. I staked my life against a living death, on
the remote chance of attaining peace. And I lost."</p>

<p>Again he smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the fortunes of the game...But don't think for a
minute that I am complaining or seeking sympathy. I have lied to
others perhaps, but not to myself. I detest a whiner&mdash;a
self-excuser. I want you to understand that."</p>

<p>He reached to the table at his side and took up a small
limp-leather volume. "Only last night I was reading Wilde's 'De
Profundis.' Had I been gifted with words, I might have made a
similar confession. Let me show you what I mean so that, at least,
you won't attribute to me the final infamy of cravenness."</p>

<p>He opened the book, and began reading in a voice whose very
fervor held us all silent:</p>

<p>"'I brought about my own downfall. No one, be he high or low,
need be ruined by any other hand than his own. Readily as I confess
this, there are many who will, at this time at least, receive the
confession sceptically. And although I thus mercilessly accuse
myself, bear in mind that I do so without offering any excuse.
Terrible as is the punishment inflicted upon me by the world, more
terrible is the ruin I have brought upon myself...In the dawn of
manhood I recognized my position...I enjoyed an honored name, an
eminent social position...Then came the turning-point. I had become
tired of dwelling on the heights&mdash;and descended by my own will
into the depths...I satisfied my desires wherever it suited me, and
passed on. I forgot that every act, even the most insignificant act
of daily life, in some degree, makes or unmakes the character; and
every occurrence which transpires in the seclusion of the chamber
will some day be proclaimed from the housetops. I lost control of
myself. I was no longer at the helm, and knew it not. I had become
a slave to pleasure...One thing only is left to me&mdash;complete
humility.'"</p>

<p>He tossed the book aside.</p>

<p>"You understand now, Mr. Markham?"</p>

<p>Markham did not speak for several moments.</p>

<p>"Do you care to tell me about Skeel?" he at length asked.</p>

<p>"That swine!" Spotswoode sneered his disgust. "I could murder
such creatures every day and regard myself as a benefactor of
society... Yes, I strangled him, and I would have done it before,
only the opportunity did not offer...It was Skeel who was hiding in
the closet when I returned to the apartment after the theater, and
he must have seen me kill the woman. Had I known he was behind that
locked closet door, I would have broken it down and wiped him out
then. But how was I to know? It seemed natural that the closet
might have been kept locked&mdash;I didn't give it a second
thought...And the next night he telephoned me to the club here. He
had first called my home on Long Island and learned that I was
staying here. I had never seen him before&mdash;didn't know of his
existence. But, it seems, he had equipped himself with a knowledge
of my identity&mdash;probably some of the money I gave to the woman
went to him. What a muck heap I had fallen into!...When he phoned,
he mentioned the phonograph, and I knew he had found out something.
I met him in the Waldorf lobby, and he told me the truth: there was
no doubting his word. When he saw I was convinced, he demanded so
enormous a sum that I was staggered."</p>

<p>Spotswoode lit a cigarette with steady fingers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Markham, I am no longer a rich man. The truth is, I am on
the verge of bankruptcy. The business my father left me has been in
a receiver's hands for nearly a year. The Long Island estate on
which I live belongs to my wife. Few people know these things, but
unfortunately they are true. It would have been utterly impossible
for me to raise the amount Skeel demanded, even had I been inclined
to play the coward. I did, however, give him a small sum to keep
him quiet for a few days, promising him all he asked as soon as I
could convert some of my holdings. I hoped in the interim to get
possession of the record and thus spike his guns. But in that I
failed; and so, when he threatened to tell you everything, I agreed
to bring the money to his home late Saturday night. I kept the
appointment, with the full intention of killing him. I was careful
about entering, but he had helped me by explaining when and how I
could get in without being seen. Once there, I wasted no time. The
first moment he was off his guard I seized him&mdash;and gloried in
the act. Then, locking the door and taking the key, I walked out of
the house quite openly, and returned here to the club.&mdash;That's
all, I think."</p>

<p>Vance was watching him musingly.</p>

<p>"So when you raised my bet last night," he said, "the amount
represented a highly important item in your exchequer."</p>

<p>Spotswoode smiled faintly. "It represented practically every
cent I had in the world."</p>

<p>"Astonishin'! And would you mind if I asked you why you selected
the label of Beethoven's Andante for your record?"</p>

<p>"Another miscalculation," the man said wearily. "It occurred to
me that if anyone should, by any chance, open the phonograph before
I could return and destroy the record, he wouldn't be as likely to
want to hear the classics as he would a more popular
selection."</p>

<p>"And one who detests popular music had to find it! I fear, Mr.
Spotswoode, that an unkind fate sat in at your game."</p>

<p>"Yes...If I were religiously inclined, I might talk poppycock
about retribution and divine punishment."</p>

<p>"I'd like to ask you about the jewelry," said Markham. "It's not
sportsmanlike to do it, and I wouldn't suggest it, except that
you've already confessed voluntarily to the main points at
issue."</p>

<p>"I shall take no offense at any question you desire to ask,
sir," Spotswoode answered. "After I had recovered my letters from
the document box, I turned the rooms upside down to give the
impression of a burglary&mdash;being careful to use gloves, of
course. And I took the woman's jewelry for the same reason.
Parenthetically, I had paid for most of it. I offered it as a sop
to Skeel, but he was afraid to accept it; and finally I decided to
rid myself of it. I wrapped it in one of the club newspapers and
threw it in a wastebin near the Flatiron Building."</p>

<p>"You wrapped it in the morning <i>Herald,</i>" put in Heath.
"Did you know that Pop Cleaver reads nothing but the
<i>Herald?"</i></p>

<p>"Sergeant!" Vance's voice was a cutting reprimand. "Certainly
Mr. Spotswoode was not aware of that fact&mdash;else he would not
have selected the <i>Herald."</i></p>

<p>Spotswoode smiled at Heath with pitying contempt. Then, with an
appreciative glance at Vance, he turned back to Markham.</p>

<p>"An hour or so after I had disposed of the jewels, I was
assailed by the fear that the package might be found and the paper
traced. So I bought another <i>Herald</i> and put it on the rack."
He paused. "Is that all?"</p>

<p>Markham nodded.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;that's all; except that I must now ask you to
go with these officers."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Spotswoode quietly, "there's a small favor
I have to ask of you, Mr. Markham. Now that the blow has fallen, I
wish to write a certain note&mdash;to my wife. But I want to be
alone when I write it. Surely you understand that desire. It will
take but a few moments. Your men may stand at the door&mdash;I
can't very well escape...The victor can afford to be generous to
that extent."</p>

<p>Before Markham had time to reply, Vance stepped forward and
touched his arm.</p>

<p>"I trust," he interposed, "that you won't deem it necess'ry to
refuse Mr. Spotswoode's request."</p>

<p>Markham looked at him hesitantly.</p>

<p>"I guess you've pretty well earned the right to dictate, Vance,"
he acquiesced.</p>

<p>Then he ordered Heath and Snitkin to wait outside in the hall,
and he and Vance and I went into the adjoining room. Markham stood,
as if on guard, near the door; but Vance, with an ironical smile,
sauntered to the window and gazed out into Madison Square.</p>

<p>"My word, Markham!" he declared. "There's something rather
colossal about that chap. Y' know, one can't help admiring him.
He's so eminently sane and logical."</p>

<p>Markham made no response. The drone of the city's midafternoon
noises, muffled by the closed windows, seemed to intensify the
ominous silence of the little bedchamber where we waited.</p>

<p>Then came a sharp report from the other room.</p>

<p>Markham flung open the door. Heath and Snitkin were already
rushing toward Spotswoode's prostrate body, and were bending over
it when Markham entered. Immediately he wheeled about and glared at
Vance, who now appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"He's shot himself!"</p>

<p>"Fancy that," said Vance.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you knew he was going to do that?" Markham
spluttered.</p>

<p>"It was rather obvious, don't y' know."</p>

<p>Markham's eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p>"And you deliberately interceded for him&mdash;to give him the
opportunity?"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, my dear fellow!" Vance reproached him. "Pray don't
give way to conventional moral indignation. However
unethical&mdash;theoretically&mdash;it may be to take another's
life, a man's own life is certainly his to do with as he chooses.
Suicide is his inalienable right. And under the paternal tyranny of
our modern democracy, I'm rather inclined to think it's about the
only right he has left, what?"</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch and frowned.</p>

<p>"D' ye know, I've missed my concert, bothering with your beastly
affairs," he complained amiably, giving Markham an engaging smile;
"and now you're actually scolding me. 'Pon my word, old fellow,
you're deuced ungrateful!"</p>
