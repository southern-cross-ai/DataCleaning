    The Tent of Mystery</b></h2>
  <p>Sir Hannibal Trevick was a personage at St. Ewalds.  Certainly he lacked money to support the dignity of his name, and therefore had  been compelled to let Trevick Grange to a South African millionaire, and take  up his abode in the Dower House at the Cornish watering-place. But he came of  an old and distinguished family, and possessed to all appearances great force  of character. Also, he was an ardent churchman, and a philanthropist. Finally,  he had a most charming daughter, who was both clever and beautiful: two things  not invariably found together.</p>
  <p>Dericka Trevick &mdash; her quaint Christian name was a  source of wonder to archaeologists, since it was that of the Babylonian  fish-goddess, could have figured as Titania at a fairy solemnity. She was small  and slender, golden-haired and blue-eyed, with a bright manner and a mercurial  temperament. Such a description gives an impression of insipidity and  shallowness. But Dericka was neither insipid nor shallow. Her will was strong,  her judgement quick and unerring, and she ruled the Dower House. Sir Hannibal  obeyed her, although he saved his dignity by pretending that such obedience was  but fatherly kindness, which could refuse nothing to his household fairy. She  dominated the mild, lean governess, Miss Warry, who had taught her everything,  and she kept a tight hand over the three domestics who formed Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s  modest establishment. In spite of her looks and manner Dericka was strong, and  could have passed for an Elizabeth or Catherine in embryo.</p>
  <p>All the same, she was popular, and therefore all the  young men of St. Ewalds were bound to her chariot-wheels. But she favoured none  of these as they were too bucolic and tame. Her heart had been given for over  six months to a smart young barrister from London, who was called Oswald Forde.  Sir Hannibal approved, for Forde was a rising man, and might yet become a K. C.  or a judge; but as yet there was no open engagement. Dericka was only twenty,  and Forde twenty-seven, so there was time enough for a mutual experiment as to  whether they would suit one another before before attempting matrimony.</p>
  <p>Forde came to St. Ewalds to bask in the smiles of  beauty whenever he could manage, and thus found himself at the fete given by  Sir Hannibal in aid of the Fishermen&rsquo;s Chapel, which was being built on a  promontory just outside the town. It was a splendidly warm autumn day, and the  spacious grounds of the Dower House were occupied by all the fashion and wealth  of the place. The square, ugly building &mdash; it was Georgian and comfortable &mdash;  looked out over the waters of St. Ewalds Bay, and possessed garden far too  large for the size of the mansion. These sloped down to a fringe of ragged  rocks, barricading smooth stretches of sand upon which broke the white Atlantic  billows. What with foreign plants and native trees, and late blooming flowers  of all kinds bordering the green lawns, the place was very lovely, and the  tents erected here and there for the fete made it look like an encampment.  People were buying and selling, and eating and drinking, and dancing, and  playing games in the hot sunshine, and Sir Hannibal secretly assured himself  with much satisfaction that the fete would bring in much money to the chapel.  He liked to play the Lord of the Manor even on a small scale, and regarded  those who attended the fete as so many worshippers who came to adore him &mdash;  which they certainly did in a most snobbish manner.</p>
  <p>As Sir Hannibal was a widower, with a daughter who  would soon be married, at least so said the gossips, many young ladies had, as  the saying goes, set their caps at him. He seemed to favour Miss Anne Stretton,  a dark-eyed, handsome woman, who was studying art, and had just enough to keep  a roof over her head and dress well, which she invariably did. Sir Hannibal, as  Miss Stretton knew, was poor, but then he had a position, and was, as she  guessed, fairly manageable. It was worth her while to be Lady Trevick, and that  position she was determined to occupy, even though her heart drew her in the direction  of Ralph Penrith, a dissipated-looking man, whose pedigree was long and whose  income was extremely small. These two were at the fete, and talked together a  great deal, perhaps, on Miss Stretton&rsquo;s part, to arouse the jealousy of Sir  Hannibal, and force him into an ardently-wished-for proposal.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have scarcely given me a word,&rsquo; complained Sir  Hannibal, advancing to where Miss Stretton sat along with his rival. &lsquo;Will you  not accept my arm and walk round the grounds?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; assented the lady, alertly, and shot a  glance at Penrith, whose face grew dark, &lsquo;but I cannot stay long. Mr. Penrith&rsquo;s  mother has asked me to stay for a few days, and he drives me out to the Manor  House at four o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is three now,&rsquo; said Penrith, looking at his watch;  &lsquo;you have an hour to explore the grounds, Miss Stretton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It will not take us long to drive five miles,&rsquo; she  replied carelessly, and walked away with the baronet, leaving Penrith sullen  and silent. After a time he strolled away to the tent where drinks were sold  and enjoyed himself there in his own gross way.</p>
  <p>Miss Stretton looked sideways at her companion as they  strolled among the visitors. She saw a well-preserved man of over fifty who  might pass for forty, and could not but admire his alert military looks and  perfect dress. Catching her gaze Sir Hannibal smiled, and examined her in his  turn. She was certainly handsome &mdash; quite a fine woman, although it could be  seen that later in life she would become stout and heavy. Her eyes were dark,  and she knew how to use them, and her frock was all that could be desired, even  by so fastidious a man as Sir Hannibal Trevick.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are very cruel to me,&rsquo; he murmured in her ear.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;On the contrary,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton, smiling. &lsquo;I  should blame you. I have been here for half an hour and this is the first time  that I have set eyes on you. But for Mr. Penrith I should have been sadly  neglected. These St. Ewald people look down upon a poor artist.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They are jealous, dear lady. You are fit to be a  queen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am a queen, without a kingdom,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton  meaningly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You shall have one soon,&rsquo; replied Sir Hannibal  significantly. &lsquo;A small kingdom, it is true, but still one wherein you can  reign supreme.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The size does not matter so long as love rules.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And love would rule, were you the queen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That so much depends on my subjects,&rsquo; replied the  lady, quickly, and cast another look on him, which made the elderly heart of  Sir Hannibal beat faster than it had done for years.</p>
  <p>They were in a secluded part of the grounds overlooking  the beach, and undoubtedly after so propitious an opening Trevick would have  proposed, but that he was interrupted. He had just opened his mouth to speak,  and Miss Stretton, with a heightened colour, was getting ready to accept him,  when Dericka appeared along with Forde. With his dark looks and her golden  beauty they made a comely couple, but Sir Hannibal frowned all the same. His  frown was reflected on the face of the calm queenly woman beside him. Dericka,  glancing from one to the other, drew her own conclusions. She knew what Miss  Stretton desired, and, not liking her, congratulated herself on thus preventing  a proposal. Forde saw nothing, and shook hands with Anne; but Dericka saw  everything with the quickness of a woman who is in love herself, and at once  proceeded to detach her father from this too fascinating adventuress &mdash; as she  characterised Miss Anne Stretton.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are wanted, papa,&rsquo; she said quickly. &lsquo;Mr. Bowring  is waiting for you in the library.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Bowring!&rsquo; echoed Sir Hannibal, growing red and  looking fierce; &lsquo;and what may Mr. Bowring want?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I really do not know. He came over from the Grange in  his motor-car and seems very anxious to see you &mdash; on business, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He might have chosen a day when I was less busy,&rsquo;  retorted Trevick, and seemed inclined to deny himself to the untoward visitor.  But on second thoughts he turned away towards the house. &lsquo;I must see him, I  suppose,&rsquo; he said ill-humouredly; &lsquo;something to do with the Grange, I expect.  He is a most expensive tenant in spite of his being a millionaire. He always  wants something done. Miss Stretton, will you excuse? Dericka, please look  after Miss Stretton.&rsquo; And he went away with a last look at Anne, who stood  silent, drawing figures on the sandy path with the tip of her sun-shade.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have you had some refreshment?&rsquo; Dericka asked her  formally.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thanks, yes,&rsquo; replied Miss Stretton with a sweet  smile, and with rage in her heart at the interruption. &lsquo;Now I must buy  something.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Or you can have your fortune told,&rsquo; said Forde  smiling. &lsquo;Go to the Tent of Mystery. Miss Warry is there, and she really tells  the most wonderful things.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Has she told your fortune?&rsquo; asked Miss Stretton with  a glance at Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is very easy to read,&rsquo; answered Forde, smiling  again.</p>
  <p>Anne tossed her head. &lsquo;How superstitious you are.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I believe that there are more things in heaven and  earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy,&rsquo; retorted the young man dryly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Poor Shakespeare; what a mis-quotation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Give the credit to Bacon,&rsquo; laughed Dericka, who  scarcely knew what to say to a woman she so much disliked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am not clever enough to decide the  Bacon&mdash;Shakespeare controversy, Miss Trevick. You are, I understand?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You praise me too much, Miss Stretton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>How far the battle of words would have gone it is  impossible to say, but the presence of Forde restrained the feminine war, and  the situation was adjusted by a glance between the two women. Then Miss  Stretton turned away with a laugh &mdash; a society laugh, to hide deeper feelings,  and left the lovers alone. &lsquo;You can talk Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; she called back  mockingly.</p>
  <p>Dericka rather talked Lady Macbeth. &lsquo;How I hate that  woman,&rsquo; she said clenching her small fist; &lsquo;an adventuress, and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is too severe, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No it isn&rsquo;t. She came here pretending to paint  pictures, but in reality to look for a husband.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Rumour gives Penrith to her in that capacity.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And my knowledge of her scheming gives her my  father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pooh! Sir Hannibal is too old to think of marriage.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A man is never too old to be cajoled by a woman,&rsquo;  said Dericka, tartly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; replied Oswald gaily; &lsquo;even my  twenty-seven venerable years have not saved me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka pinched his arm. &lsquo;You donkey.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A really nice girl would have put in an adjective.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You silly donkey!&rsquo; Where upon the young man kissed  her, and a lovers&rsquo; interlude followed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When will you allow me to ask Sir Hannibal?&rsquo; demanded  the barrister softly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To-morrow, before you go back to town. But papa will  not make any objection, dearest. He has just enough to live on, and will be  very glad to place his burden &mdash; I am the burden, if you please &mdash; on someone  else&rsquo;s shoulders.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dear burden,&rsquo; murmured Forde, taking her in his arms.  Then, when he descended to earth again, &lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Bowring help your father?  I heard that they were old friends.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Old enemies, rather,&rsquo; said Dericka with a cloud  over-shadowing her fair face. &lsquo;Mr. Bowring knew papa in Africa years ago, when  I was a little baby. When he made his money he asked papa to let him have the  Grange, and pays him a good rent. But papa and Mr. Bowring hardly ever speak  and never visit one another.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But Mr. Bowring is with him now?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, and I am going into the house to see what is the  matter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is no need,&rsquo; urged Forde, restraining her.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is every need,&rsquo; replied Dericka determinedly. &lsquo;Papa  in many things is a mere baby, and I have to do everything; besides, he has a  very quick temper, and Mr. Bowring is a very rough man. Should they quarrel,  and that is not unlikely, I don&rsquo;t know what may happen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me go with you to the house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, stop here. People always smile when they see us  together.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who cares for their smiling? We are as good as  engaged.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wait until our engagement is announced,&rsquo; said Dericka  quickly, &lsquo;then I won&rsquo;t mind. But I hate gossip, until my position is assured  with papa&rsquo;s approval.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, then you do count Sir Hannibal as something?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course. I like to do things in order. Papa, to the  outward world, is a person of character and with a strong will. But he has my  character and my will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a terrible wife I shall have,&rsquo; said Oswald  jokingly; &lsquo;you will rule me in every way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then I shall begin now,&rsquo; said the girl, laughing, but  with a fond look at his handsome face. &lsquo;Stop here and I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I  know why Mr. Bowring has come. Papa cannot do business without me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Somewhat annoyed, Forde lighted a cigarette and leaned  over the brick wall to watch the billows rolling on the shore, while Dericka  walked quickly to the house. She had cause for uneasiness, as she had heard her  father express anything but amiable sentiments towards his tenant. Mr. Bowring  was a rough man, as she had said, for she had met him once or twice, and having  lived in lawless lands he was not likely to be bound by social rules. Sir  Hannibal, weak and refined, would have no chance against his rugged strength,  nor indeed would he have any chance did Bowring do business with him. The South  African, fighting for his own hand, was always trying to get the better of his  landlord with regard to the Grange, and would have done so on three occasions but  for Dericka&rsquo;s shrewdness. Bowring bore no grudge towards the girl for her  interference, and rather seemed to admire her for her cleverness of getting the  better of him.</p>
  <p>But Dericka&rsquo;s fears as to a fracas proved to be vain,  for when she reached the front door she met Sir Hannibal and his visitor,  issuing therefrom. The baronet certainly appeared to be agitated, but Bowring  presented a calm aspect.</p>
  <p>The millionaire was a man of bronze, grey as an old  wolf, with shaggy hair fringing a bald head, and shaggy eyebrows overhanging  piercing grey eyes. His long beard was also shaggy, but his skin, in spite of  his sixty years, was fresh and pink as that of the girl who gazed at him. With  the contempt for appearance in which wealthy men indulge on occasions, he wore  a shabby suit of black, with an African felt hat, and carried in his ungloved  hands a queer twisted stick, carved and painted by the hands of some Zulu  witch-doctor. Beside Sir Hannibal, polished, stately, accurately dressed, and  eminently refined, John Bowring looked like a savage, but a savage dowered with  a powerful brain.</p>
  <p>Man of bronze as he was the keen grey eyes lighted  when they fell on Dericka, gazing fascinated by his strength.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good-day, missy,&rsquo; he said in a deep, harsh voice, yet  in a kindly manner. &lsquo;We have finished our conversation, and now your father &mdash;  my old friend,&rsquo; he cast a side glance on the baronet as he spoke, &lsquo;wants to see  the fun.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka will conduct you round the grounds,&rsquo; said  Trevick hurriedly. &lsquo;Where is Miss Stretton, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In the Tent of Mystery,&rsquo; replied the girl carelessly;  &lsquo;at least, I advised her to go there and have her fortune told.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal looked hard at his daughter, trying to  discover if her words were double-edged. But she met his gaze serenely, and  presently the baronet hurried away. Bowring turned to address the girl with  something like a chuckle when behind him appeared a mild face and a lean, gaunt  figure, in sad-coloured feminine garments.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, Sophy, are you not in the tent?&rsquo; said Dericka,  recognising her governess with surprise.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I just came in for a few minutes,&rsquo; said Miss Warry  timidly. &lsquo;It is trying work telling fortunes. I read Miss Stretton&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did you read?&rsquo; asked Dericka, curiously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sorrow and trouble and wickedness,&rsquo; said the sibyl  solemnly, and again the old millionaire chuckled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you really profess to tell the future?&rsquo; he asked  contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I really do,&rsquo; said the mild governess, nettled by his  disbelief, &lsquo;and if you will come with me to the tent I can tell yours.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My future is already my past,&rsquo; said Bowring harshly;  &lsquo;you can tell me nothing likely to interest me. However, I wish to give some  money to the chapel, and as I give nothing for nothing I may as well buy a few  fairy stories with my guinea.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I may make mistakes,&rsquo; said Miss Warry simply and  blinked with her tired old eyes, &lsquo;and sometimes I do, as I am not sufficiently  conversant with the psychic life. But I do occasionally foretell things which  really happen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let us see what will happen to me,&rsquo; said Bowring  jokingly, and with a grim smile walked after Miss Warry, who floated &mdash; the term  is very appropriate, for she did not walk like an ordinary human being &mdash;  towards the Tent of Mystery.</p>
  <p>It was now about four o&rsquo;clock, and Dericka saw her  father bidding farewell to Miss Stretton, who was hanging on the arm of the  still sulky-looking Mr. Penrith. The baronet seemed to be younger than ever as  he basked in the smiles of the adventuress. &lsquo;For she is that,&rsquo; insisted Dericka  to herself, &lsquo;and wants to marry papa for his position.&rsquo; It never occurred to  the girl, who, after all, was young in experience, that the adventuress might  seek money also, and that she was not likely to find in the pockets of Sir  Hannibal Trevick.</p>
  <p>Dericka saw the three disappear down the short avenue,  at the foot of which, presumably, waited the dog-cart of Penrith, wherein he  proposed to drive Miss Stretton over the moorland to his mother&rsquo;s place. She  then walked about amongst the visitors, exchanging a few words, and making  herself agreeable. Chance brought her in front of the Tent of Mystery, and from  it there issued Bowring, looking somewhat white, followed by the governess.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me?&rsquo; asked Miss Warry severely &mdash;  that is, as severely as her mildness would permit.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Bowring harshly, &lsquo;you talk nonsense.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet you seem to be upset,&rsquo; said Dericka suddenly, and  looking at him in a curious, puzzled way.</p>
  <p>Bowring wiped the perspiration from his high, bald  forehead.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have had a turn,&rsquo; he said gruffly, &lsquo;but from  nothing that woman told me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The governess had again retired into the tent, and  Dericka, thinking that the fortune-telling was at an end, was about to conduct  the millionaire to the refreshment stall, when Miss Warry again appeared,  holding an envelope in her hand. &lsquo;Mr. Bowring,&rsquo; she called, and some people  turned at the sound of the name.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he asked gruffly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In this envelope I have written a prophecy which I  read in your hand. It will be fulfilled before tomorrow. The envelope is  sealed, and if what I have written here occurs, then the truth of my art will  be made manifest.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Bowring took the sealed envelope and thrust it into  his pocket. &lsquo;I shall look at it tomorrow night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It may be too late!&rsquo; said the sibyl solemnly, and  vanished into the tent.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Chapter  II<br>
    The Prophecy Fulfilled</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;What does she mean by that?&rsquo; asked Bowring sharply,  when the governess had disappeared to foretell the futures of fresh dupes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said Dericka. Then she pointed to the  pocket into which the millionaire had slipped the sealed letter. &lsquo;You can  learn, if you read what is written.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Bowring took the letter out and twisted it in his  gnarled, lean hands in a thoughtful manner. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said abruptly, and after  some meditation. &lsquo;If it is good, it can wait; if evil, I must meet it blindly,  as it is best that the future should be hidden from our eyes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet you went in there to inquire?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I wanted to give my guinea to the chapel. I  give nothing for nothing. In that way I made my money. It is all rubbish, this  fortune telling,&rsquo; he added, looking keenly at Dericka. &lsquo;Has Miss Warry ever  told your fortune?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. By the cards and by the hand, and by looking  into the crystal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you believe what she said?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka blushed, and looked away in the distance to  where Oswald Forde appeared, sauntering idly in search of her, with a  cigarette.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I should like to believe,&rsquo; she said softly.</p>
  <p>Bowring&rsquo;s eyes followed her, and he also saw the  handsome young fellow. The sight appeared to annoy him, and he frowned.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are foolish, girl,&rsquo; he said roughly. &lsquo;We make our  own fortunes, good or bad, and it needs no palmistry to tell that as we sow, so  shall we reap.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka, her eyes still fastened on her lover, who  paused to talk with a pretty girl, defended what Miss Warry called &lsquo;her art&rsquo;.  In a musing voice she replied. &lsquo;To some natures,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the veil between  the seen and the unseen is very thin. Such natures may have a premonition which  turns out true, or they may read by the present the doubtful future. I have  known several of Sophia&rsquo;s prophecies come true in the end.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sophia?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Warry. She is my governess, and has been for  many a long day, but shortly she is leaving us, as the success of her  fortune-telling has made her desirous to earn money in that way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If she sets up in London,&rsquo; said Bowring grimly, &lsquo;she  will be haled before the magistrates as a swindler, and quite right too. The  woman&rsquo;s a fool.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She is a very good, kind woman, Mr. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo;&mdash; the millionaire shrugged his large shoulders  &mdash;&lsquo;she certainly has a strong advocate in you, Miss Trevick. Where is your  father?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Somewhere about,&rsquo; said Dericka, looking round. &lsquo;Do  you wish to see him again?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not at once; though I would like to see him before  five o&rsquo;clock, when I must leave. It is a long drive to Trevick Grange, but my  motor is swift, and I&rsquo;ll get home very rapidly. I want to have a chat to you  before I go away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;With me?&rsquo; Dericka looked surprised. There was little  in common between this old man and herself.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He led the way towards a secluded corner where there  was a garden seat, and nodded that she should follow, with the air of a man who  is accustomed to be obeyed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your father and I have been talking about you,&rsquo; he  said abruptly, when Dericka was seated.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; Dericka replied coldly, and fastened her  brilliant blue eyes on the rugged face. She was not going to commit herself by  asking questions until she knew how the land lay. Bowring, as she intuitively  saw, was a man to be delicately handled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You seem to be a girl with a head on your shoulders.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thank you for the compliment. But why pay it to me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have heard of the way in which you manage this  house, and your father, who is, and always was, a simple man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because he was with me out in Africa years and years  ago, when you were a tiny girl. He came home about the time your mother died,  and came home, too, without a penny. Now I,&rsquo; the millionaire expanded his chest  in a grandiloquent fashion, &lsquo;I have made my fortune! I am worth a great deal of  money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So I understand,&rsquo; said Dericka coldly; &lsquo;but what has  all this to do with me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am coming to that. It has a great deal to do with  you. I rented the Grange from your father, not because I wanted it, but so as  to help him. I pay a fancy rent, upon which he lives.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have no right to talk to me like this,&rsquo; said  Dericka, reddening. &lsquo;After all, my father is my father, and your old  association in South Africa does not give you the right to insult him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The millionaire was immovable.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are a girl of spirit,&rsquo; he said approvingly. &lsquo;I  like you none the worse for it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;With your permission,&rsquo; said Dericka, rising, and  speaking sarcastically, &lsquo;I will join our visitors and attend to my duties.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Join that young popinjay there,&rsquo; said Bowring,  nodding his head in the direction of Forde. &lsquo;I see well what it means.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; Dericka looked angry, and really felt angry.  &lsquo;My private affairs have nothing to do with you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They have a great deal to do with me, as your father  and I agreed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me reply by asking another question, my dear.  When Miss Warry told your fortune did she say who was to be your husband?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I refuse to answer that question,&rsquo; said Dericka with  spirit; but all the same she did answer it by looking again at Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Bowring, looking also; &lsquo;he is not to be  your husband.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I chose for myself, Mr. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a little spitfire you are. Listen. I want to  help your father as he is my old friend and is poor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never knew that my father and you were friends.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We have both been very thick, certainly,&rsquo; said  Bowring grimly. &lsquo;He has kept away from me, and I from him. But today, I came  over to make it up. We have done so, although it was not an easy task. Your  father so far forgot himself as to threaten me with death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ridiculous!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So I told him,&rsquo; said Bowring quietly; &lsquo;but for  reasons connected with South Africa he would not be sorry to see me in my  coffin. However, I managed to make him understand that his interest and mine  are identical, and proposed a new arrangement.&rsquo; He paused.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said Dericka, interrogatively.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I intend to pay your father a larger rent and help  him out of his present difficulties, of which you are cognisant, if you &mdash; you,  Miss Trevick &mdash; will marry my son Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka rose with a bewildered air.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Marry your son &mdash; that idiot?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is not quite an idiot,&rsquo; said Bowring in vexed  tones, &lsquo;although his will is weak. All the better for a woman of your managing  capability, my dear. Morgan wants a woman who can handle him firmly, and from  what I have heard of you, Miss Trevick, you are the woman who would make Morgan  a good wife. Also, you are a girl of old family, and the daughter of a baronet.  Against these advantages I set my money. If you will marry Morgan and turn him  into something resembling a man, I will give you your old family seat of the  Grange, and allow you and your husband ten thousand a year. When I die you will  get the lot of my money. Also, I will put your father&rsquo;s affairs right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you serious?&rsquo; demanded the girl, with a red spot  on either cheek.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perfectly. I never waste words.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Neither do I. Wait!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She walked away, leaving Bowring wondering what she  was about to do, and speedily returned with Oswald Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have asked this gentleman to come,&rsquo; said Dericka  coldly, &lsquo;so that he and you may hear my answer. Oswald, Mr. Bowring and my  father have decided that I shall marry Morgan, the son of this man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka, you will not, when I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When you love me,&rsquo; she finished, and placing her arms  round his neck she kissed him fondly. Then, turning to Bowring, who looked on  grimly at this comedy, she said promptly, &lsquo;Do you require any further answer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What does all this mean?&rsquo; asked Forde in angry tones.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It means that Mr. Bowring wanted to buy me and that I  am not for sale. It means, Oswald, that I will marry you whenever you like.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It means also,&rsquo; broke in Bowring, perfectly composed,  &lsquo;that if you do not obey your father and marry my son, Sir Hannibal Trevick,  baronet as he is, will be disgraced.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Disgraced! What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I advise you to ask your father that,&rsquo; said Bowring  sarcastically. &lsquo;You will find that he is on my side, and is anxious to call  Morgan his son-inlaw. For the rest, I can wait. He pulled out his watch and  glanced at it. &lsquo;Five o&rsquo;clock; I must go. I&rsquo;ll return tomorrow to see if your  conversation with your father has modified your attitude. Good-day!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When the millionaire had gone Dericka stared after him  in consternation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What does he mean?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Blackmail,&rsquo; said Forde quietly. &lsquo;My legal experience  tells me that much. Your father was in South Africa and apparently got into  some scrape. This man knows all about it, and unless you marry this Morgan  Bowring he will tell all the world something, which your father would rather  keep concealed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oswald,&rsquo; said Dericka rapidly, &lsquo;my father is weak and  foolish in many ways. But I do not believe that he has done, or would do,  anything disgraceful.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then why is this man so certain that you will marry  at his bidding?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka passed her hand across her forehead with a  weary air.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;This Morgan Bowring is  half an idiot &mdash; a most dreadful person to look upon. Were he sane I would not  marry him, much less when I know, what all St. Ewalds knows, that the man is  not responsible for his actions in a great measure. My father would never  consent to my marrying him. I am sure of that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde was silent. He knew that Sir Hannibal was a  selfish man, and probably had pages in his past life which he would not like  read by the world. To save himself from a single pang he would sacrifice  Dericka without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. But he did not tell this to the girl for  obvious reasons, and remained awkwardly silent. It was the girl who first  recovered her speech.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I shall see my father at once,&rsquo; she said decisively,  &lsquo;and confront him with Mr. Bowring before he leaves this place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde acquiesced, but a search for the master of the  house was in vain. Sir Hannibal was not to be found in any of the rooms, nor in  the gardens. People, having exhausted the pleasures of the fete, were already  leaving, and Dericka, with Forde at her heels, went down to the gates thinking  to find her father there, saying farewell to some of his visitors. Instead she  found Mr. Bowring getting into a 50-hp. Hadrian machine, more like a racer than  a simple motor-car for travelling country roads. Bowring addressed her:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I cannot find my old friend Sir Hannibal,&rsquo; he said  with something like a sneer, &lsquo;or I should have told him of our conversation.  But I&rsquo;ll come again tomorrow. Good evening.&rsquo; And as the chauffeur placed his  hands on the wheel the motor swung off with a powerful hum, like a gigantic  bee.</p>
  <p>Dericka stared after the machine, but found nothing to  say. Then she went back with Forde to again search for Sir Hannibal, and again  was unsuccessful.</p>
  <p>What Bowring thought of the girl&rsquo;s defiance it is  impossible to say. He sat thinking deeply, sometimes with a grim smile, and  again with a frown corrugating his brows. The chauffeur, a quiet, fair young  fellow called Donalds, engineered the racer &mdash; for the Hadrian certainly was  that, from the speed she was going at &mdash; up the High Street of St. Ewalds and  out into the open country. Many people stopped to look at that low, rakish form  painted grey, and looking uncanny, which ran up the steep ascent of the street  like a fly up a wall. Everyone knew Bowring, and envied him the wealth which  could command such a vehicle.</p>
  <p>But when the steep ascent was mounted the machine ran  smoothly along a level road until she topped the next and slid round a sloping  curve, which dropped her into a valley. Then again came a rise, and she slipped  forward humming into wild waste lands.</p>
  <p>On all sides stretched the naked moorland, covered  with heather and gorse, and huge grey stones lying here and there as though a  Cornish giant had dropped a handful of pebbles from his pocket. On either side,  here and there rose rounded hills, topped with cromlechs and rocking-stones,  and streaked with purple lights. The west flared with the vivid colours of the  sunset, delicately pink, and melting on the horizon into sheets of shimmering  gold. To the left were the bleak hills bathed in the imperial purple of the  setting sun; to the right the cold blue of the trembling ocean, with white  waves near shore tumbling amongst the black jagged rocks. Bowring knew the  landscape well, and troubled himself very little about the beauty it took on  under the changing hues of the western sky. He was thinking of many things &mdash;  perhaps of his past, which rumour said was not all that could be desired. But  of one thing he certainly was thinking, and that was the firm face of the  fairy-like creature who had defied him. He wondered that so frail a form could  contain so brave a spirit. Dericka was the very wife for the half-mad Morgan,  and would bring good blood into the family. Then he, John Bowring, millionaire,  could die in peace, leaving the firm foundations of a county family.</p>
  <p>So the old man dreamed, while the car buzzed along the  smooth road, swooping into hollows, soaring up ascents, and, spinning like a  live thing, sped along endless levels. About three miles from St. Ewalds came a  long downward stretch of road, which afforded Donalds the chance of letting his  machine go. And go she did, with a roar and a rush like a live bombshell. The  keen air cut sharply against their faces as they hummed down the long descent.  At the foot the road took a sharp turn under some high banks, above which  stretched the purple of the moorland. With Bowring dreaming, and Donalds  exulting in the speed of the powerful machine, the car swept round the curve at  a tremendous rate. But once round, and with another short road descending  before her to a second corner, she had scarcely darted forward a short distance  when right in front loomed up a huge mass of granite in the very centre of the  roadway. With a cry of horror Donalds put on the brakes. But it was too late.  The Hadrian met the mass of granite full, and the two men were hurled into the  air, above a smashed mass of steel and iron, smoking and hissing.</p>
  <p>It was like a nightmare. The chauffeur was tossed like  a cork down a bank and fell on a soft bed of purple heather, narrowly missing a  mighty stone, which would have killed him. Dazed and confused, and not knowing  how time was passing, Donalds painfully climbed up to the road again. He saw,  as in a dream, the broken motor-car, vague and doubtful-looking in the twilight,  and saw also his master struggling to his feet. As Bowring straightened  himself, swaying to and fro, a man leaped down from the high bank, and without  hesitation, put a revolver to the old man&rsquo;s ear. The next moment Bowring fell  as the report rang out, and Donalds, gasping with horror, weak from loss of  blood, and confused by the shock, fell fainting down the bank, to all  appearances as dead as the old millionaire.</p>
  <p>But the shot had attracted attention. The murderer  heard a shout, and without hesitation regained the top of the steep bank and  vanished amidst the purple heather. Scarcely had he done so when round the  corner came several labourers at full speed. They were quarrymen employed in  breaking stones in an old quarry which belonged to Trevick Grange. These ran  forward, exclaiming at what they saw. The whole appearance of the wreckage told  a story &mdash; the broken car, the insensible man, and the great mass of granite in  the centre of the road.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But the shot?&rsquo; said one man, picking up Bowring&rsquo;s  body. He dropped it with a cry of horror. &lsquo;Look!&rsquo; he cried, and pointed to the  head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Murder!&rsquo; said several voices, and the quarrymen  looked at one another in the fast gathering twilight.</p>
  <p>The sounds of wheels were heard rattling furiously,  and round the second corner, whence the quarrymen had appeared, rushed a  dog-cart bearing Penrith and Miss Stretton.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; they asked. &lsquo;We heard a shot,  and came back.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bowring&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; said a man with a civilised accent.  &lsquo;Shot!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dead! Shot!&rsquo; cried Penrith, while Miss Stretton  shrieked, and he leaped down with a horrified face. &lsquo;Let me see.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>While he examined the body Anne Stretton, with a white  face and trembling lips, alighted also. Near the body her quick eye caught  sight of an envelope. Picking this up she tore it open.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It might contain something likely to say who killed  him,&rsquo; she said shaking; &lsquo;perhaps the assassin left it here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What does it say?&rsquo; asked Penrith, while the quarrymen  crowded round and one struck a match for her to read the letter by.</p>
  <p>She read slowly: &lsquo;You will be killed before you reach  home this evening!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was a dead silence, and all looked at the body.  The prophecy had been fulfilled.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter  III<br>
    Queer Evidence</b></h2>
  <p>The violent death of John Bowring caused, as was  natural, an immense sensation in the district. Not only because crime was  comparatively rare in those sparsely-inhabited parts, but also on account of  the position and great wealth of the victim. The news ran like wildfire through  the countryside, and the local reporters gathered like vultures round the  famous corpse. But the evidence they picked up was scanty, as the police,  ignorant themselves of many things, were reticent. No one knew why Bowring had  been murdered, but there was a grim determination about the crime which revealed  very clearly that the assassin had made up his mind that the millionaire should  not escape. Failing with the granite rock, he had made certain with the  revolver, and therefore must have had some extremely strong motive to induce  him to place, so to speak, his neck twice in the hangman&rsquo;s noose.</p>
  <p>Then came out the fact of the sealed letter. Anne  Stretton might have chattered, or some of the quarrymen to whom she read the  single prophetic line might have told the story, or Miss Sophia Warry, proud of  her powers, might have boasted of her achievement. No one knew exactly how the  rumour got about, but certainly within four-and-twenty hours there were few  people who had not heard of the strangely-fulfilled prophecy, and this  introduction of a psychic element gave the case a weird interest, which removed  it from the category of commonplace crime.</p>
  <p>The body was taken by the quarrymen to Trevick Grange,  which stood a couple of miles from the scene of death, amongst the wild Cornish  moors. It was a rambling, two-storey house of rough grey stone, roofed with  bluish slates, and covered with ivy and lichen, as though it were indeed  natural to the soil. The mansion amidst its circle of wind-clipt trees, and  fronting the changeful waters of the Atlantic, looked picturesque, but  uncommonly grim; as autochthonic as the early British dwellings further up the  moorlands. For centuries the Trevicks had dwelt there, and not always in the  most reputable way; but pecuniary necessities had forced the present baronet to  let the family seat to John Bowring, and retire to the more cheerful Dower  House at St. Ewalds. So the body of the millionaire, who in life had lorded it  under the ancient roof, was placed in the guest chamber, and the house was  given over to a mourning atmosphere, which suited its sinister looks.</p>
  <p>Of course, Sir Hannibal was greatly shocked. He and  the dead man had not been very good friends, although they had passed through  many adventures in the waste lands of South Africa. All the same, it was  terrible to think that a man full of life and health and ambitious schemes  should so suddenly be removed from the physical sphere, and in so horrible a  manner. Also, Sir Hannibal recognised that he had lost a good tenant. No one  would pay him so excellent a rent; and, moreover, the solitary situation of  Trevick Grange rendered it somewhat difficult to let, even at a moderate price.  Sir Hannibal, being intensely selfish, was sorry for John Bowring, but he was  more sorry for himself, and grumbled greatly as he drove out to the inquest  with Dericka and Miss Warry. The last-named lady had come by particular  request, as the coroner wished to know how she has so accurately foretold the  death of the millionaire; and Dericka accompanied her old governess to support  her in the ordeal. Not that Miss Warry anticipated trouble when being examined,  for she was rather glad to display her cleverness; but she felt that Dericka  would be a comfort to her at so proud a moment.</p>
  <p>And along the road beside them streamed carts and  carriages and motor-cars and bicycles of all kinds. Everybody seemed to be  going to the old Grange, being drawn there mostly by morbid curiosity. The  place where the death had happened was like a fair, as sightseers were  exploring every inch of the ground, and some enterprising individuals had  erected tents for the sale of refreshments. The granite rock itself had been  blasted to atoms as it impeded the traffic, but the place whence it had fallen  could be seen in the jagged rent overhead and the raw earth, which gaped  through the heather. Some wiseacres insisted that the mass had fallen of its  own accord, as wind and rain and sunshine had undermined its foundations; but  others pointed out that the stone must have been purposely pushed over the  cliff, whereon it had been balanced, since the herbage around was trampled and  broken. And from the position of the rock, as it was remembered, a powerful man  with an iron lever could easily have overturned the same to crash down on the  highway below.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who the dickens can have done it?&rsquo; mused Sir  Hannibal, as with his party he drove through the chattering crowd.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We cannot tell until the inquest is over,&rsquo; said  Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And perhaps not even then,&rsquo; piped Miss Warry, casting  a side glance at the baronet, whom she greatly admired. &lsquo;No one was about the  road at the time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The quarry is near at hand,&rsquo; suggested Miss Trevick;  &lsquo;perhaps the men working there may have seen someone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So far as that goes,&rsquo; remarked Sir Hannibal,  judiciously, &lsquo;Donalds, the chauffeur, saw the murderer, though he did not recognise  him. In the twilight recognition would certainly be difficult, let alone the  confused state in which the man&rsquo;s brain must have been.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Had Mr. Bowring any enemies?&rsquo; asked Miss Warry  artlessly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Any amount,&rsquo; replied the baronet grimly. &lsquo;Every  successful man has, you know. But I don&rsquo;t see what anyone had to gain from  killing him. I presume Bowring&rsquo;s wealth goes to his son?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To that half-witted creature?&rsquo; exclaimed Dericka  quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; and he is not so mad as people make him out to  be.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly too mad for me to marry,&rsquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, that is all ended with Bowring&rsquo;s death,&rsquo; said Sir  Hannibal a trifle uneasily. &lsquo;He certainly did propose something of that sort.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And it made you angry,&rsquo; said Miss Warry with apparent  innocence.</p>
  <p>The baronet turned on her sharply:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why do you say that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I went into the house while you were closeted with  Mr. Bowring in the library, and I heard your voice raised in anger.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so. And my anger was on account of what Dericka  has said. It was impertinent of Bowring to propose that his son should marry my  daughter. Apart from the fact that Morgan is what the Scotch call &ldquo;a daftie&rdquo;,  neither his birth nor his position are fitted to make him my son-inlaw.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But he will be rich now,&rsquo; protested Miss Warry,  casting down her grey-green eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If he had a million I would not marry him,&rsquo; cried  Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And he has a million,&rsquo; murmured the governess.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal looked at her uneasily, and after  clearing his throat and considering for a moment or so, he gave a perfectly  unnecessary explanation:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bowring and myself were not very good friends,&rsquo; he  said slowly, &lsquo;as he treated me very badly in Africa. Still, he was a good  tenant, and his death&rsquo;&mdash; he cast a sidelong glance at the governess, such as she  had earlier cast at him &mdash;&lsquo;his death,&rsquo; he added emphatically, &lsquo;will be very  harmful to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am sure it will,&rsquo; murmured the governess meekly.</p>
  <p>And still Sir Hannibal did not look satisfied.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;See that place?&rsquo;&mdash; he pointed with his whip towards  the picturesque grey mass of the Grange, which was now only a short distance  away &mdash;&lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t everybody&rsquo;s money, and Bowring paid me a splendid rent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; asked Miss Warry quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because liked the house,&rsquo; retorted Sir Hannibal  sharply; &lsquo;but, as I was about to say when you interrupted me &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am so sorry, Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As I was about to say, no one else will pay the same  rent, or pay it so regularly. Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s death is a great &mdash; a very great  blow to me, Miss Warry. I am sure you agree with me, Dericka?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied his daughter, rather surprised  that Trevick should take all this trouble to explain what seemed to her to be a  perfectly obvious fact. &lsquo;However, Morgan may stay on here, with Mrs. Krent, the  housekeeper, to look after him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; said the baronet, frowning.  &lsquo;She is a scheming, meddlesome woman, who came with Bowring from Africa. I  expect she has been trying to get Morgan to marry her daughter Jenny.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am sorry for Jenny, if that is the case,&rsquo; replied  Dericka calmly. &lsquo;She is too pretty a girl to be thrown away on that half-mad  oaf.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Morgan is rich,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal as the carriage  passed up the avenue of his ancestral seat, &lsquo;and Jenny hasn&rsquo;t a penny. It would  be a good match for her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It would be a sin,&rsquo; cried Miss Trevick emphatically.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal shrugged his aristocratic shoulders.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that, my dear. Morgan is sickly, and may  not live long; his widow will be able to make a most advantageous second  marriage. I almost wish,&rsquo; he added with an attempt at jocularity, &lsquo;that you had  married the creature, Dericka. Then, when he was laid beside Bowring you would  be able to keep your poor father in his old age and renew the splendours of the  Trevick family.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry raised her little eyes as Sir Hannibal made  this speech, and gave him a piercing glance.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The marriage can take place still, can it not, Sir  Hannibal?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If Dericka consents,&rsquo; laughed the baronet, but still  uneasily.</p>
  <p>Indignation had hitherto kept Dericka silent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I would rather die,&rsquo; she burst out at last, when the  carriage stopped before the porch of the Grange. &lsquo;Morgan is mad and dangerous.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! no!&rsquo; protested Sir Hannibal, &lsquo;very harmless.  Bowring assured me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Bowring made the best of what could not be  helped,&rsquo; retorted his daughter. &lsquo;I say that Morgan is dangerous, and falls into  wild beast rages. Your jest is a poor one, father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps it was not a jest,&rsquo; tittered Miss Warry,  meaningly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, it was,&rsquo; said the baronet quickly; &lsquo;merely a  jest, though perhaps not in the best possible taste.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I agree with you there,&rsquo; said Dericka coldly;  &lsquo;especially as I am really engaged to Oswald.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have not given my consent to that, Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you will,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I marry for love,  father, not for money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet you should know the value of money,&rsquo; groaned  Trevick, entering the house.</p>
  <p>Dericka&rsquo;s blue eyes flashed with sapphire lights, and  but for the publicity of the place she might have made some retort. Sir  Hannibal hitherto had always been ready to approve of Forde&rsquo;s wooing, penniless  barrister though he was; but since Bowring&rsquo;s visit and proposal of marriage on  behalf of his idiot son, he had wavered considerably. Dericka almost thought  that Sir Hannibal wished her to marry the semi-lunatic for the sake of the  money. And Miss Warry deepened this impression.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your father is sorry that the money should be lost,&rsquo;  she whispered as they walked towards the room in which the inquest was to be  held. &lsquo;Why not marry Morgan Bowring, and when he dies be a rich widow and  become Mr. Forde&rsquo;s beloved wife?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Marry that?&rsquo; said Dericka in a fierce whisper, and  pointed with her pretty, scornful chin towards a weak-looking man who sat next  to a stout elderly woman and beside a pretty doll-like girl. &lsquo;Are you out of  your senses, Sophia?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry, as she always did when at a loss for a  reply, tittered in a nervous manner, and meekly subsided into a chair between  Sir Hannibal and his daughter.</p>
  <p>Morgan Bowring&rsquo;s wandering eyes rested on the  newcomers. He passed over Sir Hannibal and the faded governess with  indifference, but he looked with passionate eagerness at Dericka&rsquo;s beautiful  face. There was something almost savage in his fixed regard. But Dericka was,  as has been said, a girl of unusually strong character, and she was not going  to be outstared by one whom she regarded as a lunatic. Her blue eyes met his  grey eyes with a hard dominating look, and a quiver passed over the animal  countenance of Morgan. The light died out of his face, and with a kind of a  whimper he suddenly grasped the hand of the stout, elderly woman, who  undoubtedly was Mrs. Krent, the housekeeper. At once she turned to soothe him,  and flashed an angry glance on Dericka. But that young lady having achieved her  object in letting Morgan know that she was stronger than he, looked indolently  round the room, and began to take an interest in the proceedings.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As we have inspected the body,&rsquo; said the coroner, a  lean man with a mild, sheeplike face, and no very great intelligence in his  dull eyes, &lsquo;we will now hear the evidence. Inspector Quill.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The inspector related how the body had been found, and  how Bowring had come by his death. He detailed what he had discovered  concerning the fall of the stone, which amounted to nothing. Quill insisted  that the stone had been forcibly overturned, but although, as he admitted, he  had examined the quarrymen, he could not learn who had cast down the rock. Nor,  as the inspector again stated, had the quarrymen seen any suspicious person  haunting the neighbourhood. He proposed to call several witnesses, and first  named Donalds, the chauffeur, who alone had caught a glimpse of the criminal.</p>
  <p>Donalds, who still looked ill from his shaking, had  very little to say. He had been pitched down the bank when the car rushed  against the stone, and on struggling up again, half dazed with the shock, he  had dimly seen a man leap down the cliff whence the stone had fallen and blow  out the brains of his staggering master. But Donalds could not say whether the  man was short or tall, fair or dark, lean or stout. He caught but a glimpse of  the crime and the criminal, and then had fainted. He had, as he said, never  noticed the granite rock particularly when it had swung overhead in its  accustomed place.</p>
  <p>The doctor then appeared, a local practitioner who had  been summoned to examine the body when it had been taken to the Grange. The  deceased, he stated, had been shaken by the shock of the car smashing against  the granite rock, but apparently, from the absence of marks, and the condition  of the body, had been very little hurt. He would undoubtedly have been himself  in a couple of days, as he would have merely suffered from shock. And even at  the age of the deceased the shock would not have caused death. The revolver  wound was different. The weapon had been placed so close to the dead man&rsquo;s head  that the hair had been scorched. The brains had been blown out, and death must  have been instantaneous. As the bullet had gone right through the head and had  spent its force whistling across the moor, it could not be found, so it was  impossible to gain any clue in that direction.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent&rsquo;s evidence amounted to the fact that she  had come with Mr. Bowring from Africa as she had been, and still was, the nurse  of his son, who could not be left to himself. So far as she knew the deceased  had no enemies, and had no fear of meeting with a violent death. He had left  the Grange in very good spirits to go to Trevick&rsquo;s fete, and she (the witness)  had been more astonished than anyone else when the body was brought home.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal Trevick gave evidence that he had known  Bowring in Africa. He disagreed with Mrs. Krent, as Bowring undoubtedly had  many enemies, although witness knew of none who would have gone so far as  murder. The deceased had been quite cheerful at the fete, and had gone away in  good spirits, intending to call the next day on witness. So far as Sir Hannibal  knew, the deceased had no expectation of meeting with a violent death, and Sir  Hannibal protested that he could throw no light on the subject. After a few  final remarks as to the loss he had sustained by the death of a good tenant,  witness stepped down.</p>
  <p>So far nothing had been educed likely to reveal why  Bowring had been murdered, and there was not, in all the evidence procurable, a  single clue to the identity of the brutal assassin. The onlookers became  slightly bored as they heard the many prosaic facts set forth, but everyone  woke up and looked alert when Miss Warry was called. It was to hear the truth  of the governess&rsquo;s strange prophecy that the majority of the listeners had  come.</p>
  <p>Miss Warry stated that the deceased had entered the  tent an avowed sceptic, and had challenged her to give some proof that her  psychic information was absolutely true. She read his hand, and looked into the  crystal. In a way which Miss Warry declined to explain, as it would not be  understood by the uninitiated, she had discovered that Bowring would die before  he reached home. This prophecy, as she called it, she had written down and had  placed it in an envelope. On the death occurring the letter had been opened by  Miss Stretton, who was present, and the truth of her art became apparent. To  all this the coroner listened sceptically, and many of the jury with profound  awe. They were prepared to accept Miss Warry as a second Deborah in those  superstitious parts.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come now,&rsquo; said the coroner testily, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t expect  us to believe this hocus-pocus.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I expect you to believe nothing,&rsquo; said Miss Warry  coolly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did anything occur which might make you think that  Mr. Bowring anticipated meeting with an accident?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry meditated.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was certainly the Death&rsquo;s Head,&rsquo; she said  thoughtfully. &lsquo;He assuredly was afraid of the Death&rsquo;s Head.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter  IV<br>
    The Will</b></h2>
  <p>When Miss Warry, with the air of an accomplished  actress, pronounced those strange words &mdash;&lsquo;He assuredly was afraid of the  Death&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;&mdash; an eloquent silence followed. What she meant no one knew; the  coroner least of all.</p>
  <p>But Dericka started and looked up suddenly as a memory  crossed her mind. Sir Hannibal, who sat beside her, had been looking down while  Miss Warry gave her evidence, but, while not starting as his daughter had done,  he raised his eyes slowly and directed a long, piercing glance at the  governess.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, she was gazing in his direction, and  their eyes met. Trevick&rsquo;s were the first to fall. And all this comedy was  noticed by Mrs. Krent, who, since Dericka had attracted the attention of  Morgan, had kept her eyes fixed venomously on father and daughter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you mean by that speech?&rsquo; asked the coroner,  puzzled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, it is easily explained.&rsquo; Miss Warry tossed her  head as she spoke. For the first time in her tame life she found herself on the  stage of life, so to speak, and an object of interest to an admiring crowd, who  regarded her as a sibyl. In the midst of a dead silence she explained herself.  &lsquo;The skull in the tent, you know,&rsquo; said Miss Warry.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am still in the dark. I must ask you to be more  explicit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;At the fete,&rsquo; said the witness, &lsquo;I occupied a tent in  order to tell fortunes. It was hung with red cloth, and there was a small round  table covered with a black silk shawl. On the table were a pack of cards and a  crystal; also a magnifying glass to read more clearly the lines of the hands of  those who desired to know the future. All this,&rsquo; added Miss Warry, with a  glance of supreme contempt at the obtuse coroner, &lsquo;doubtless strikes you as what  you call hocus-pocus.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It strikes me as fraudulent,&rsquo; said the coroner dryly.  &lsquo;No one can foretell the future.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I abide by what I wrote in the sealed envelope, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah. That is the point at which we wish to arrive. You  must have had information to enable you to say that Mr. Bowring would not live  longer than the evening?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; cried Miss Warry indignantly, &lsquo;do you mean to  say that I am an accomplice before the fact?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not exactly; but you saw something in the deceased&rsquo;s  demeanour, or he said something which enabled you to guess that he anticipated  meeting with a violent death? You gambled, so to speak, on the chance?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing of the sort. I read in his hand, with the  cards, and by the crystal, that he would die before he reached home.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet you said that he was frightened by the death&rsquo;s  head?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So he was. When he entered the tent he saw it on the  table, and at once grew perfectly white. I thought he would have fallen, and  perhaps he would have, had I not caught his arm. He murmured something about &ldquo;The  third time &mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; asked the coroner eagerly.</p>
  <p>Miss Warry grew tart.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How can I talk, sir, when you interrupt me? Mr.  Bowring, I repeat, said something about &ldquo;The third time.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The third time of seeing the skull?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose so. At least his eyes were fixed on it when  he made the remark. What it meant I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you not ask him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As I am a woman, and possess my fair share of  curiosity, I did,&rsquo; admitted the witness, &lsquo;but he refused to tell me why the  sight of the death&rsquo;s head caused him such emotion.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did he say in reply?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Merely that the heat of the day had overcome him, and  that he was not superstitious, and that he only wanted to get something for the  guinea he gave me as he didn&rsquo;t believe in fortune-telling.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you say that he would die before he got home?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. I merely read his character, and he said that I  read it all wrong. Which,&rsquo; said Miss Warry, drawing herself up, &lsquo;was a story,  as I am quite sure that I read him correctly; and he wasn&rsquo;t at all a nice man  either,&rsquo; she ended spitefully.</p>
  <p>The coroner passed this very feminine speech over.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you did not say that he was within a short  distance of meeting a violent death?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No; and, what is more, I didn&rsquo;t know that Mr. Bowring  would meet with a violent death. I saw by the card and in his hand, and in the  crystal, that he would die &mdash; no more. I wrote down the words so that after his  death the truth of what I said should become apparent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I see.&rsquo; The coroner looked more puzzled than ever. He  was too physical to believe in the psychic, and yet all that Miss Warry had  said was true. The sealed letter with its fulfilled prophecy was a stern fact  which could not be proved false. And on the face of it the meek little  governess could have had nothing to do with the millionaire&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did the death&rsquo;s head excite the fears of the  deceased?&rsquo; asked the coroner, wondering in what way he could best pursue the  examination.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I told you before that Mr. Bowring refused to  explain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where is the skull?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was a movement of surprise in the room.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rsquo; repeated the coroner. &lsquo;Yet I presume  you placed the skull on the table yourself so as to add to the effect of your  fortune-telling?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did nothing of the sort,&rsquo; said Miss Warry angrily.  &lsquo;When I returned to the tent I found the skull on the table. I thought Sir  Hannibal had placed it there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I?&rsquo; cried the baronet, starting to his feet and  looking very white. &lsquo;No, I never saw any skull.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then I don&rsquo;t know who brought it,&rsquo; said Miss Warry.  &lsquo;Miss Trevick did not, because I asked her. I went into the house to get  something, when Mr. Bowring was with Sir Hannibal in the library, and when I  returned to the tent the skull was on the table. I saw Mr. Bowring immediately  afterwards. When I gave him the sealed paper, and he went away, I came out  before the tent, and remained chatting for a few minutes. When I re-entered the  skull was gone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then someone must have placed the skull there while  you were in the house, and while you chatted before the tent after Mr.  Bowring&rsquo;s departure someone must have removed the skull?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Miss Warry. &lsquo;I thought it odd, and spoke  to Miss Trevick; but she knew nothing about the matter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This is true,&rsquo; said Dericka calmly, while all eyes  were fastened eagerly on her face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I also could have nothing to do with it,&rsquo; said  Sir Hannibal with a forced laugh, &lsquo;since I was talking with Mr. Bowring in the  library at the time when, according to Miss Warry, the skull must have been  placed in the tent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Was there a skull in the house, Sir Hannibal?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not to my knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What kind of a skull was it?&rsquo; said the coroner,  addressing Miss Warry. And the governess shuddered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A horrible thing,&rsquo; she said in a faltering voice.  &lsquo;Quite like a nightmare. It was not very large, but it was coloured scarlet,  and round the forehead to the back was a broad band of silver, like a crown.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Everyone was interested in this strange description.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wonder you did not take charge of such a queer  thing, Miss Warry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I would have done so, but it vanished.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But how did it vanish?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I really cannot say,&rsquo; snapped the witness, who was  growing weary of this cross-questioning. &lsquo;It was in the tent when I went in to  tell Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s fortune, and vanished when I returned after he went away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did anyone else besides yourself and Mr. Bowring see  it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not to my knowledge. Have you quite done with me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the coroner mechanically. And Miss Warry,  looking very tired, stepped down.</p>
  <p>Her evidence was so strange that he hesitated whether  to believe it or not. Such a person might very well, as he thought, be the  victim of an hallucination. Or again, the tale of this red skull might be a  made-up story to advertise herself. On the other hand, the sealed letter was a  fact.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is all the evidence, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the coroner  after a pause.</p>
  <p>There was some chatter, and then the coroner made a  speech in which he recapitulated all that had been discovered, and dwelt on the  extraordinary evidence of the governess. But all his explanations could not  throw any light on the mystery which undoubtedly environed the death of the  millionaire. It did not take the jury long to consider their verdict, for the  evidence left them completely in the dark. All that could be discovered was  that Bowring had been shot by an unknown person who had failed to murder him by  upsetting the motor-car.</p>
  <p>A verdict of wilful murder against some person or  persons unknown was brought in, and the inquest was at an end.</p>
  <p>Then the reporters who had been taking voluminous  notes rushed away to build up the odd tale of Miss Warry into sensational  articles. Everyone agreed that the case was more mysterious than ever, and Sir  Hannibal was quite annoyed when he heard for the first time of the scarlet  skull.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You should have told me of this,&rsquo; he said angrily.</p>
  <p>Miss Warry, who was the person spoken to &mdash; and the  conversation took place in the Dower House drawing-room, after dinner &mdash; looked  down meekly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never thought it would interest you,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I  certainly mentioned it to Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you speak?&rsquo; asked Sir Hannibal, turning on  his daughter, who was writing a letter to Forde detailing all that had happened  at the inquest, for the young barrister had returned to London.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was no necessity,&rsquo; she answered, raising her  eyes for a moment. &lsquo;I thought someone at the fete might have placed the skull  in the tent as a joke. Certainly, had I known at the time that it frightened  Mr. Bowring, or that he was to die, I should have made enquiries. But it will  be impossible now to find out who placed it in the tent, or for what reason.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was placed there to frighten Bowring,&rsquo; said  Trevick angrily, &lsquo;so the person must have known that he was to have his fortune  told, and also must have known something of Bowring&rsquo;s past life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know much,&rsquo; said Miss Warry meaningly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; assented Sir Hannibal; &lsquo;much that is bad, and  much that is good, for Bowring was a strange mixture of good and evil. But I  can safely say that I know nothing about a Death&rsquo;s Head, coloured scarlet. It  is extremely strange. I shall ask Mrs. Krent what she knows likely to throw  light on the matter when I go over to hear the will read at the Grange.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka looked up suddenly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you go to hear the will read?&rsquo; she asked quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly. Gratton, the lawyer, has come down from  London to attend the funeral and look into things. He wrote saying that I was  to attend the reading of the will, so I am going. Perhaps Bowring has  remembered me for a trifle; or it may be that he wishes me to be the guardian  of Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Or, perhaps,&rsquo; said Miss Warry, with a titter, and her  eyes fixed on the baronet, &lsquo;poor Mr. Bowring has left his property to Dericka,  on condition that she marries his son.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is extremely unlikely,&rsquo; said Dericka coolly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know so much about that, since Mr. Bowring  had the marriage in his mind on the very day of his death,&rsquo; snapped Miss Warry.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You talk nonsense,&rsquo; said Dericka, with great  calmness, and rising with the letter to Forde in her hand. &lsquo;And now, Sophia,  you may as well tell my father that you intend to leave us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Sir Hannibal, wheeling round from the  window at which he was smoking a particularly fine cigar. &lsquo;You, Miss Warry &mdash;  who have been with us since Dericka was a baby &mdash; leave us?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Miss Warry bashfully. &lsquo;I must make  provision for my old age, and the emoluments here,&rsquo;&mdash; with a viperish glance at  Sir Hannibal &mdash;&lsquo;are not regularly paid.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I cannot make money out of nothing,&rsquo; said the baronet  colouring slightly, for Miss Warry&rsquo;s speech touched his pride; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll pay up  before you go, although I think you are unwise to leave us. How the dickens can  you make your living?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry coloured in her turn, and with anger:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I am not quite so helpless as all that, Sir  Hannibal,&rsquo; she said shrilly. &lsquo;This truth I told about poor Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s death  has made my fame. I am going to London to set up as a fortune teller.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get into the hands of the police.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll have powerful influence at my back.  Everyone will come to me, for my prophecy about this death has made a great  sensation. I&rsquo;ll make a lot of money, and retire in a few years.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But that prophecy was all rubbish,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal  angrily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was nothing of the sort. It was true, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you really read all that in Bowring&rsquo;s hand?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry gave him an odd glance.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I really did,&rsquo; she said in a solemn tone. &lsquo;You are a  sceptic, but for once you and other jesters have been compelled to acknowledge  the truth.&rsquo; And with this Parthian shot the governess left the room, with less  meekness than she usually showed, and certainly with less veneration for the  idol of her fancy, as Trevick had been.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She has altered altogether,&rsquo; said Dericka, looking at  her father. &lsquo;The success of this prophecy has sent her mad. She used to be  quiet, and now is noisy, and really has been quite rude to me. I am glad she is  going.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; said Trevick with a gloomy air, &lsquo;only it  looks as though the rats were leaving a sinking ship. Without Bowring&rsquo;s  assistance I really don&rsquo;t know what to do for ready money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wait till you hear the will read,&rsquo; said Dericka  slipping her arm within that of Sir Hannibal in a caressing manner. &lsquo;The poor  man may have remembered you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Humph! It&rsquo;s very unlike Bowring if he has. However,  you must come over and listen with me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why? &mdash; it is not necessary?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, it is. I cannot face that gloomy house and that  scowling housekeeper alone. Of course, if you are afraid of Morgan &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am afraid of nothing,&rsquo; interrupted Dericka with a  quiet smile, and spoke truly, for she had no fear. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you, father,  and perhaps we may hear of something to our advantage, as the papers put it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She ended with a laugh which passed into a sigh. It  was very hard on the girl to grub amongst sordid cares when she wished to be  free and happy. But a sense of duty left her no option. Sir Hannibal was like a  large child, and unless she guided him he would get into trouble. Dericka  longed for the day when he would marry a second time, and select a capable,  managing woman who would look after him. Then she could become Oswald&rsquo;s wife  and have at least a few years of happiness.</p>
  <p>Thus it came about that Sir Hannibal drove his  daughter over to the Grange after the funeral. The body of John Bowring was  laid to rest in the St. Ewalds churchyard. Mrs. Krent, prompted by ambition for  the fame of her dead master, had suggested the family vault of the Trevicks, in  the little village church near the Grange. But Sir Hannibal refused, and so the  millionaire was laid to rest in a less aristocratic grave. All the population  of St. Ewalds turned out to follow the mourning coaches &mdash; not because Bowring  had been popular, but simply on account of the notoriety of his death.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent was there with Morgan, who, dressed in a  new black suit, looked more uncouth and ungainly than ever. And when the  service was ended those immediately concerned with Bowring went to the Grange  to hear how the dead man had disposed of his worldly goods.</p>
  <p>The listeners to the will were gathered in the great  drawing-room, a sombre-looking apartment, which looked out on to the terrace of  grim grey stone. Mr. Gratton, the London lawyer, a smart-looking young fellow,  read the will.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent, as usual, placed Morgan between herself  and her pretty, doll-like daughter, and Sir Hannibal sat near the window with  Dericka by his side. There were many people present who had done business with  Mr. Bowring, and also a crowd of servants at the door. No one anticipated any  surprise from hearing the will read &mdash; Mrs. Krent, least of all. It was thought  that without doubt Bowring would leave all the property to Morgan, who was his  only son, with perhaps an indication as to guardianship. And Mrs. Krent hoped  and prayed that she would be appointed to look after the weak-minded heir.  There would be some fine pickings out of so wealthy an estate. Therefore Mrs.  Krent was uneasy on seeing Sir Hannibal present. She thought that Bowring, in  spite of his unconcealed enmity to the baronet, might have made him Morgan&rsquo;s  guardian, in which case she would be turned out of house and home.</p>
  <p>But Mrs. Krent never expected to hear what she did hear;  nor did anyone else.</p>
  <p>After various legacies to servants and friends, it was  found that the whole of the property was left to Sir Hannibal Trevick.</p>
  <p>Morgan was disinherited, and the baronet was the heir.  Mrs. Krent rose with fire in her eyes, and screamed with rage.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You,&rsquo; she foamed, shaking her fist; &lsquo;you killed  Bowring for this.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter  V<br>
    After&mdash;Events</b></h2>
  <p>Mrs. Krent was beside herself with anger as she hurled  her very direct accusation at Sir Hannibal. At any time the stout elderly  woman, with her little pig&rsquo;s eyes and red face and dyed yellow hair, would not  have been considered beautiful: but at the present moment, with her features  distorted with rage, she looked like a virago of the Revolution. It is no  exaggeration to say that Mrs. Krent, had she possessed the power, would have  there and then murdered the lucky baronet. Indeed, she half flung herself  forward to scratch his face, and only the frightened clutch of her daughter  prevented her from doing so. If ever a woman saw red and went baresark, Mrs. Krent  was that woman. She was as one possessed by a devil.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal never quailed: his courage was too high  for that. Without rising he stuck his glass in his eye and calmly surveyed the  infuriated creature. If he was a trifle paler than usual no one saw it, save  Miss Warry, who kept a vigilant eye on his every movement. Why she should do so  was not quite clear: but she certainly watched her employer rather than Mrs.  Krent. Everyone else in the room, alarmed at the savagery of the housekeeper,  looked at one another in consternation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You murdered my master,&rsquo; bellowed Mrs. Krent,  clenching her fat hands and quivering with passion.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal never moved a muscle.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Such an accusation is not worth rebutting,&rsquo; said he  with easy assurance. &lsquo;My late friend &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Friend!&rsquo; scoffed the housekeeper. &lsquo;Why you and him  quarrelled cat and doglike when you met.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As you were never, to my recollection, present at any  of our interviews, Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; retorted the other dryly, &lsquo;I scarcely see how  you can substantiate that statement.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know! I know!&rsquo; muttered the woman cowering a  trifle. &lsquo;Bowring never liked you. Him and you in Africa &mdash; oh, yes, you may  wriggle, sir; all the same, you daren&rsquo;t tell of your doings.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Gratton&rsquo;&mdash; Sir Hannibal, still cool and unshaken,  and addressing himself to the lawyer &mdash;&lsquo;I apologise for this interruption to  your reading of the will. I am the more annoyed,&rsquo; he added, fixing a cold eye  on Mrs. Krent, who was calming down rapidly, &lsquo;that it should have taken place  in my house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your house!&rsquo; screamed the housekeeper, angered again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;By inheritance from my own ancestors, Mrs. Krent, and  now by legacy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said the smart young lawyer, speaking to  Mrs. Krent, &lsquo;that you had better sit down. I have not finished reading the  will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, mother,&rsquo; urged Jenny, pulling her parent&rsquo;s  skirts. &lsquo;You are frightening Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The disinherited son did indeed look frightened. His  usually pale face was grey with fear, his large eyes looked furtively here and  there as if to seek a refuge, and he licked his scarlet lips &mdash; they were  unhealthily red &mdash; in a nervous manner. Dericka, who had sat unmoved throughout  the scene, stared at the creature curiously, and wondered that Bowring should  have dared to ask her to marry such a person. She wondered more that her father  should have even thought of consenting to the match. But now there was no need  that she should be sacrificed like another Iphigenia, since the desired money  had come to Sir Hannibal on no conditions. At the same time Dericka wondered  why John Bowring had made such a will. Meanwhile Mr. Gratton resumed his  interrupted reading. Then it became apparent that there was some sort of  condition, although its fulfilment depended upon Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s personal view  of the matter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I should like,&rsquo; read the lawyer, rustling the  important-looking document, &lsquo;that my old friend Trevick should marry his  daughter to my son Morgan for reasons he knows of, and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; interrupted Sir Hannibal, raising one  white hand. &lsquo;I know of no reason why such a marriage should take place. If the  legacy is contingent on such a match I decline to accept it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is not contingent,&rsquo; answered Mr. Gratton, calmly.  &lsquo;In any case you inherit the property. But my late client suggests that Miss  Trevick should marry young Mr. Bowring,&rsquo; and he glanced at Morgan, who was  looking with sudden eager interest at Dericka.</p>
  <p>That young lady sat cool and composed, as though the  discussion did not concern her.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And if Miss Trevick refuses to marry Morgan?&rsquo; asked  Mrs. Krent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As she does refuse,&rsquo; put in Dericka in a clear, hard  voice.</p>
  <p>Gratton shrugged his shoulders. &lsquo;Things remain as they  are,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;In any case, Sir Hannibal inherits.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Am I a pauper?&rsquo; demanded Morgan, speaking for the  first time, in a thick, heavy, hesitating voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no. Sir Hannibal by the will is instructed to  allow you two hundred a year, and any further sums he may think fit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then my poor boy will not get one penny,&rsquo; wailed Mrs.  Krent, wiping her red little eyes. &lsquo;Oh, gentlemen, excuse me calling Morgan so,  but I have nursed him for years, in Africa as in this place. He is like my own  flesh and blood, and to think that he should be cast upon a cold world with his  poor brain is cruel, wicked, horrible, and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Before Mrs. Krent could come out with her final  adjective the baronet interposed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You exaggerate,&rsquo; he said sharply. &lsquo;Morgan will  receive the two hundred a year and such further sums as may be necessary to  make him comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Out of sixty thousand a year,&rsquo; flashed out the woman  in cold fury. &lsquo;Oh, thank you for nothing, Sir Hannibal. I call it a wicked  will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I certainly think,&rsquo; remarked Gratton, addressing the  baronet, &lsquo;that it will be as well for you, sir, to carry out the suggestion of  the testator and marry Miss Trevick to &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Marry that?&rsquo; interrupted Dericka, rising suddenly.  &lsquo;Are you out of your mind, Mr. Gratton? The man is not fit to marry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The answer came, not from the lawyer, but from Morgan  himself:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But if I love you?&rsquo; he stammered thickly. And then,  before he could speak further he was pulled back into his seat by Mrs. Krent.</p>
  <p>Dericka turned pale. There was something terrible in  the animal gaze which the half-mad creature cast upon her. The wild look in his  eyes, the tremulous movement of his hands, the repulsive appearance of his  white face with its scarlet lips and weak chin, repelled her as though a snake  had crossed her path.</p>
  <p>Strong-minded as she was, the timidity of the female  came to the surface as Morgan glared at her in a leering manner. Biting her  lips to keep down the climbing hysteria, she fairly ran out of the room and was  followed by gaunt Miss Warry immediately. Sir Hannibal kept his composure.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My daughter cannot marry you, Mr. Bowring,&rsquo; he said  coldly, &lsquo;as she is already engaged.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you cannot take my money if she doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; growled  Morgan.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The money is not yours, but mine,&rsquo; corrected Sir  Hannibal, eyeing the disinherited man as though he were a dog, &lsquo;and you may be  sure that you will be well looked after.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be looked after,&rsquo; mumbled Morgan, and  there came into his eyes the anger of a dog about to snap. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a free man. I  won&rsquo;t be shut up!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hush! Hush, lovey,&rsquo; whispered Mrs. Krent, and drew  him down beside her. &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be shut up, but live always with your Martha.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That entirely depends upon how you behave, Mrs. Krent,&rsquo;  said Sir Hannibal tartly. &lsquo;If I am forced to take measures to put away Mr. &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A snarl from Morgan made him stop and retreat a step.  Mrs. Krent fondled the man and cast a warning look in Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s direction.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you rouse him I won&rsquo;t be answerable,&rsquo; she said  sharply, &lsquo;and as to sending me away, I won&rsquo;t go; that is, until Morgan marries  your daughter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I will,&rsquo; growled the man heavily.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal felt a qualm. The speech and look of the  creature were too horrible for words, and he quailed at the idea of Dericka  being handed over to such a husband. However, a timely thought that he was not  compelled to gain the money by such a sacrifice restored his courage, and with  a contemptuous look he again spoke to Mr. Gratton.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have you finished?&rsquo; he asked in icy tones.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nearly,&rsquo; replied the young man hurriedly, and went on  to read out various instructions as to the estate, and also some details about  Mrs. Krent, who was, it appeared, to be allowed a legacy of one hundred a year,  and to be sent away, or retained, as Morgan&rsquo;s guardian, at the discretion of  Sir Hannibal.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Two pounds a week,&rsquo; wailed Mrs. Krent when in  possession of these facts. &lsquo;Oh, what a cruel will! And I saved John Bowring  thousands.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I shall see that you have justice,&rsquo; said the baronet,  grandly.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent glared, and again looked as though she  could have struck the lucky inheritor of the Bowring property. However, her  attention was taken off by the complaints of various persons who had expected  to receive money but had been disappointed. One and all resented the fact that  Sir Hannibal, connected by no ties of blood with Bowring, should have  inherited, and one and all turned on the baronet. Some even hinted in loud  tones that Mrs. Krent&rsquo;s accusation might be true. Sir Hannibal winced, for the  sound of the angered voices was unpleasant. He raised his hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is no need for me to be placed on my defence,&rsquo;  said Sir Hannibal calmly. &lsquo;Everyone knows that at the time of the death I was  attending to my guests in the grounds of the Dower House. Moreover, I had no  reason to murder my lamented friend.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You did it to get the money,&rsquo; snapped Mrs. Krent  viciously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you say that again,&rsquo; retorted the baronet  smoothly, &lsquo;I will send you away with your one hundred a year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And part me from Morgan?&rsquo; she panted. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have heard the will, and know that I have  unlimited power,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, sharply; &lsquo;and as there is no further need  to prolong this scene I shall bid you all good-day. Mr. Gratton, you can come  to see me at St. Ewalds to consult about the business. Mrs. Krent, Mr. Bowring,  you can remain here until such time as I make up my mind what is to be done.  Good-day all.&rsquo; And with a polite bow Sir Hannibal stalked grandly from the  room, leaving the disappointed people to comfort one another. One and all,  under the stress of such disappointment, were certain that Sir Hannibal had  murdered Bowring.</p>
  <p>The drive home was a silent one. The baronet, mindful  that the groom was at his back, handled the reins in complacent silence and  dreamed of what he would do with the thousands of Bowring&rsquo;s. Dericka was still  suffering from the revulsion of feeling which Morgan&rsquo;s unexpected wooing had  brought about, and Miss Warry, gaunt and grim as usual, stared straight in  front of her, occasionally watching her employer&rsquo;s face. When Sir Hannibal  smiled at his own thoughts Miss Warry smiled also. Perhaps she was thinking of  her successful prophecy as Sir Hannibal was thinking of his good fortune. But,  whatever might be the cause, Miss Warry smiled very often in the course of the  drive.</p>
  <p>On reaching the Dower House, Dericka would have  retired at once to her own room, but that Sir Hannibal requested her presence  in his library.</p>
  <p>She followed him there in a languid manner, but the  first speech he made strung her up to a fighting humour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My child,&rsquo; said the baronet blandly, &lsquo;by the  dispensation of Providence&rsquo;&mdash; he rolled the phrase on his tongue &mdash;&lsquo;my  difficulties have been unexpectedly ended. With this money we can now take our  proper place in the county. It is my intention to refurnish the Grange and  reinhabit the home of my ancestors. I shall do my share, Dericka, and I would  point out that you must do yours by making a better match that that you  contemplate.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka looked directly at her father, whose eyes were  averted, and her colour rose.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You said that I was engaged an hour or so ago?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Merely to satisfy that maniac, my dear. I do not wish  you to marry him. But with your beauty and my money &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s money,&rsquo; interposed Dericka cruelly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mine now,&rsquo; said the baronet with emphasis. &lsquo;With my  money, my dear, I think you should marry a title.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One would think you lived at Bayswater to hear you  talk so respectfully about titles. I am not of that way of thinking myself; I  intend to marry Oswald.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. He is not a good match for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I intend,&rsquo; repeated Dericka, rising slowly and  speaking slowly, &lsquo;to marry Oswald Forde. Your opposition will only make me  marry him the sooner.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka, would you leave your old father?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The pathetic speech failed of its effect.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think you can console yourself very well,&rsquo; said  Miss Trevick, coldly.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal changed colour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think you do, father,&rsquo; she answered, going to the  door, &lsquo;and now I will lie down for an hour! There will be no need for us to resume  this discussion later. My mind is made up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka, I forbid,&rsquo; began the outraged father, but  spoke to the empty air. The door opened and closed and he was alone, fuming  with anger at this behaviour of his daughter. He knew well that he could not coerce  her into obeying him, as for years she had, in spite of her youth, exercised  rule over the household. That was all very well, Sir Hannibal considered, when  they were poor, as Dericka&rsquo;s clever head kept things smooth &mdash; but now that  ample funds were in hand the baronet wished to assert himself. Consequently he  was annoyed that his first exercise of a long-surrendered authority should be  quietly ignored.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She shall not marry Forde,&rsquo; he assured himself,  pacing the library, &lsquo;or if she does it will be against my express wish. Not one  penny will she get of the money. As for myself&rsquo;&mdash; he cast a complacent look in a  near mirror &mdash;&lsquo;I am still young enough to marry and beget an heir. Then let  Dericka look to herself, and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Here a sharp knock at the door made him start. Since  the death of Bowring his nerves were not well under control.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; he cried with a violent start. Then, when  the door opened slowly, &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Miss Warry. I am engaged.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rsquo; said the gaunt governess, clasping  her thin hands and speaking in a mincing manner, &lsquo;but I go to town tomorrow,  and I have not much time to speak.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I really do not see what there is to speak about,&rsquo;  said Sir Hannibal coldly. &lsquo;You have arranged to go, and did so arrange at a  time when it was inconvenient. Now, however, this unexpected inheritance makes  things easier for me. You will receive your full salary for the year tomorrow,  Miss Warry, and then we can say goodbye for ever.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no &mdash; not for ever,&rsquo; said Miss Warry, and fishing  in a little velvet bag which dangled from her wrist she brought out a  handkerchief. &lsquo;I cannot bear to lose sight of you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, well, you can come and see Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I spoke of you, dear Sir Hannibal,&rsquo; moaned the  spinster.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am very much obliged to you, Miss Warry, but I think  you will survive the loss of my company.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never! Never!&rsquo; And Miss Warry raised her cold eyes to  the ceiling. &lsquo;At this time my place should be by your side &mdash; so old a friend!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal shivered, although the room was perfectly  warm and free from draughts.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; he asked quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The accusation of that horrid woman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pooh! Rubbish! She can prove nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is there anything to prove?&rsquo; questioned the governess  smartly, dropping the handkerchief.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No &mdash; no; of course not,&rsquo; stammered the baronet,  annoyed by the shrewd glance of her grey eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;People are so censorious,&rsquo; continued Miss Warry,  throwing up her mittened hands, &lsquo;they will add to the accusation of Mrs. Krent,  and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They can add nothing,&rsquo; interrupted Sir Hannibal  quickly. &lsquo;I was, as I explained, here at the fete about the time the murder  took place so many miles away. There is nothing to connect me with it; and I  scarcely think, Miss Warry, that I am the man to kill a fellow creature in cold  blood.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;People rarely murder in cold blood,&rsquo; murmured Miss  Warry significantly; &lsquo;a sharp word or two, a blow, and all is over.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In this case it happens to be a pistol shot,&rsquo; said  the baronet dryly. &lsquo;Come, Miss Warry, you have not asked for this interview to  accuse me of committing the crime?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry threw up her hands with a scream.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no no,&rsquo; she minced, waving the handkerchief;  &lsquo;dear Sir Hannibal, how can you think that I would dream of such a thing? But  people are censorious, you know, and it may be they will say things.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let them say things.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It may be unpleasant.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pooh! Sixty thousand a year will soon close their  mouths.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Miss Warry, replacing the handkerchief in  the velvet bag and drawing the strings, &lsquo;if you want me I&rsquo;ll give you my  address. I may be able to help you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In what way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I may be able to help you,&rsquo; she repeated, and moved  towards the door in a stately manner.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal placed himself in her path.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you know something likely to elucidate the mystery  of this crime, Miss Warry?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say that. But I may be able to help you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That skull affair is peculiar?&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal,  inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very. And you think it is peculiar? Oh&rsquo;&mdash; Miss Warry  flung up her hands again with a little laugh &mdash;&lsquo;you can depend upon me, Sir  Hannibal,&rsquo; and with a curtsey she swept from the room, leaving Sir Hannibal  nervous and upset by her mysterious hints.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What does she know about that Death&rsquo;s Head?&rsquo; he asked  himself uneasily. But Miss Warry was not there to answer.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter  VI<br>
    Mrs. Krent&rsquo;s Diplomacy</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;Money does not bring happiness!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal found speedily that this proverb was  certainly true in his case. Hitherto, since he had arrived from Africa to  settle in St. Ewalds his life had been fairly smooth, in spite of everlasting  money troubles; but now that the very things that used to worry him were  eliminated he found himself in stormy waters. Gossip, as Miss Warry had  predicted, had magnified the unsubstantiated accusation of the housekeeper, and  there was a growing feeling that Sir Hannibal in some way was concerned in the  murder.</p>
  <p>Of course, no one was bold enough, or brave enough, to  come forward and accuse him in so many words. If that had been the case the  baronet might have been able to put a stop to the scandal by a direct denial.</p>
  <p>But everywhere people were talking about the very  opportune death of the millionaire, which had placed a pauper gentleman in  receipt of a surprisingly good income. Round the tea-tables of spinsters, in  the drawing-rooms of married ladies, in public-houses, and at the corners of  streets Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s character and actions and appearance and past were amply  discussed. No one could exactly make out how he was concerned in the crime, as  assuredly he had been present in his own grounds about the time the murder had  been committed. All the same, it was hinted that if not the actual perpetrator,  he was at least an accomplice, and had hired a man to place the block of  granite in the path of the motor. More, to make sure, he had instructed his  accomplice to shoot Bowring should the first attempt on the man&rsquo;s life fail, as  it had done. The motive for the commission of the crime was to be found in the  inheritance. Sir Hannibal was notoriously in want of money and had murdered  Bowring in an indirect manner to obtain it.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is all nonsense,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton, who was one  of those who defended the baronet. &lsquo;Sir Hannibal is incapable of committing  such a wicked deed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She said this to Mr. Penrith, who was not exactly the  person to whom such a remark should have been made seeing that he was jealous  of the too fascinating baronet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why he shouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; growled Penrith  sulkily; &lsquo;anyone would do anything for money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You would,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton with a glance of  disdain.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And so would Trevick. Everyone knew that he was  desperately hard up. Of course you defend him. You want to marry him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He wants to marry me,&rsquo; she rejoined with a gratified  laugh, &lsquo;but I am not quite sure that I will accept him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anne, when you know that I love you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear Ralph, you are very nice on occasions, and  you are not bad-looking. All the same you have very little money, and your  mother is not inclined to surrender her position as mistress of your house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She will if you marry me,&rsquo; urged the love-lorn  squire.</p>
  <p>Miss Stretton shook her head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your mother is not fond of me,&rsquo; was her reply, &lsquo;and  seemed pleased when I left the house. I am only a poor artist, and she doesn&rsquo;t  think me good enough to marry a Penrith.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think you good enough. Anne, you must marry me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. That is &mdash; I can&rsquo;t say definitely at present.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Penrith was white with rage.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is because you want to marry the old man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s not so very old, and he is wonderfully  well-preserved. Also, my dear Ralph, he has sixty thousand a year, remember.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Gained by murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have no right to say that,&rsquo; she said sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll say what I like, and do what I like.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You brute; a nice husband you would make.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; Penrith saw that he had gone too far. &lsquo;You  can guide me in any way you like, Anne. Chuck this old duffer and marry me.  We&rsquo;ll be jolly happy together.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m, I have my doubts of that,&rsquo; she replied. Then, so  as not to lose him, for Miss Stretton was a lady who liked to have two strings  to her bow, she added, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give you an answer yet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; snarled Penrith, his healthy red face growing  scarlet, &lsquo;you will marry me if Sir Hannibal refuses you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo; she asked in a spirited  manner. &lsquo;Let me tell you, Mr. Penrith, that I am not a woman to be refused. Sir  Hannibal wants to marry me. I have reason to know that,&rsquo; and her hand slipped  into the pocket of her dress.</p>
  <p>Penrith&rsquo;s eyes followed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He had written, asking you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; she answered significantly. &lsquo;At all events,  I have not made up my mind to accept him. Perhaps,&rsquo; she cast a cajoling look at  her cross lover, &lsquo;I may become Mrs. Penrith after all &mdash; on conditions.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Conditions!&rsquo; Penrith stared with open mouth.</p>
  <p>Anne laid a slender hand on his arm.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear Ralph,&rsquo; said she in a grave voice, &lsquo;there is  a lot of gossip about Sir Hannibal which I firmly believe to be false. I heard  that you have said things about him also. Now, if we are to be friends, you  must hold your tongue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is the condition, is it?&rsquo; said Penrith, his face  turning pale with anger. &lsquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ll tell the truth about Sir Hannibal,  and to the police. Then he&rsquo;ll hang, and you&rsquo;ll marry me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you have been saying something against him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; because I know that you want to marry him, and I  have made up my mind that you shan&rsquo;t. Sir Hannibal is guilty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne gasped.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How can you be sure? What do you know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know from a chap called Polwin &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s steward!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. Josiah Polwin says that immediately after we &mdash;  you and I&mdash; left the fete on that day that Sir Hannibal came after us on a  motor-bicycle.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ridiculous! You drove slowly. He would soon have  caught us up: yet we did not even see him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, because he went another road.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then he could not have come after us,&rsquo; said Anne  Stretton, crisply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin says that he did. At all events, he certainly  left the Dower House on his motor-bike, and took the direction of the quarries.  They are near the spot of the accident&rsquo;&mdash; Penrith sneered as he pronounced the  word &mdash;&lsquo;and I believe that Sir Hannibal went there and murdered Bowring; then he  remounted his bike and got back to the fete before it was over. He could easily  do the whole business in an hour and a half &mdash; if not in less time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton, &lsquo;and I shall  ask Sir Hannibal myself, Mr. Penrith. He is my friend, and I won&rsquo;t let him be  traduced.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The young man sneered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The future Lady Trevick doesn&rsquo;t want her husband to  be hanged.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is no danger of his being hanged.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, there is; and in any case he&rsquo;ll have to leave  St. Ewalds. Feeling is running high against him, and he&rsquo;ll be mobbed if he  stops.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This was undeniably the case, as Anne knew. She  wondered if, after all, Sir Hannibal had murdered Bowring. On a quick  motor-bicycle &mdash; and she knew that he was a good rider &mdash; he could have rapidly  reached the spot near the quarries where the death had taken place. There was  another road by which he could have come, and so have avoided her and Ralph  driving in the dog-cart. Long before Bowring could arrive in his car he would  be on the high bank, able, with the aid of a lever, to topple the granite mass  on to the road. And after shooting the man he could easily have clambered up  the bank again to run across the moor to the other road, where his bicycle was  probably waiting. In twenty minutes after the commission of the crime he could  be back in the Dower House grounds exhibiting himself to his guests, and so be  ready with an alibi. Things looked assuredly very black against the baronet.</p>
  <p>Miss Stretton was a lady who made up her mind  promptly. She was, as Dericka surmised, an adventuress, and was not scrupulous  as to ways so long as she attained her ends. In this instance she was rather  pleased to hear of Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s peril, as it enabled her to pose as his  friend &mdash; to rescue him, as it were &mdash; and thus gain his eternal gratitude. He  was quite willing to marry her, she knew, and even if he had committed the  murder she cared very little so long as she became mistress of sixty thousand a  year. Penrith was pretty well off and very deeply in love with her, but his  mother was not friendly, and her position would be uncomfortable. Besides,  Penrith might kick over the traces after the marriage, and had the makings of a  brute in him. Sir Hannibal was a gentleman, a baronet, a wealthy man, and had  an easy temper. He was the man she wished to marry; therefore, after the  conversation with Penrith, Anne determined to interview the baronet and place  him on his guard by telling the tale which Polwin had related to Penrith. Then  she would get Sir Hannibal to retreat to London and there marry her. They could  go abroad for a few years until the scandal of the crime had blown over, and  all would be well.</p>
  <p>Having thus arranged her plans, Miss Stretton prepared  to carry them out. Seizing an opportunity when she knew that Dericka would be  absent, for she did not wish to meet that very sharp young lady, Miss Stretton  called at the Dower House.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is Sir Hannibal at home?&rsquo; she asked when the door was  opened.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss,&rsquo; replied the servant, &lsquo;but he is engaged  just now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wish to see him. Will he be long?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I cannot say, Miss. Mrs. Krent is with him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Anne, wondering what Mrs. Krent was saying  to the baronet; &lsquo;well, then, I&rsquo;ll wait. I am going to London, and wish to see  Sir Hannibal before I leave St. Ewalds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The servant, knowing that she was a great friend of  his master&rsquo;s, admitted her at once, and conducted her to the drawing-room. It  was a small apartment, like all the rooms in the Dower House, and had two  French windows opening on to a small terrace. Approaching the window to admire  the view of the beach and bay, Anne heard the murmur of two voices close at  hand. Then she recollected that the library was next to the drawing-room, and  likewise had windows opening on to the terrace. A peep round the corner showed  her that one of these had been left open, and the clearness of the voices assured  her that the speakers were very injudiciously near the window. Anne could hear  comparatively plainly what was being said, and, taking her chance, sat down  cautiously to listen. One of the speakers was Sir Hannibal, as she recognised  his refined and pleasant voice. The other, from the coarse, female tones, she  presumed was that of Mrs. Krent. Not thinking that they had a listener in the  next room, the host and his visitor spoke tolerably loud. Anne listened with  all her ears.</p>
  <p>If she could have seen through the wall she would have  beheld Mrs. Krent seated near the desk, which was close by the open window.  That good lady was arrayed in the deepest black, but apparently not liking so  sombre a garb, she had smartened herself by adding a yellow shawl and a quantity  of silver ornaments. Also, she carried a red leather bag and a green parasol,  which contrasted oddly with the crape on her dress. Her face was redder than  ever, and she frequently wiped it with a mauve handkerchief. Sir Hannibal,  refined and well-bred, resented the presence of this common-looking woman in  his library. But there was no help for it as Mrs. Krent had come on business  and was determined to have her say. At the point of the conversation when the  voices first struck on Miss Stretton&rsquo;s ear Mrs. Krent was volubly urging her  claims for money.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been with Bowring for twenty years,&rsquo; she  declared in her rough voice, &lsquo;and he always promised to look after me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He left you a hundred a year,&rsquo; said the baronet  smoothly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing. I look to you to give me one  thousand.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What! Mrs. Krent, and after accusing me &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir&rsquo;&mdash; Mrs. Krent rose and folded her podgy hands. &lsquo;I  ask your pardon for saying what I did. I was not myself when I spoke. I am  quite sure that you had nothing to do with the matter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good! Then perhaps, Mrs. Krent, you will spread that  story and help me to regain the popularity which I seem to have lost.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve heard nothing against you, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is not true,&rsquo; replied Sir Hannibal quietly.  &lsquo;Everyone seems to be under the impression that I murdered Bowring, and that  impression, Mrs. Krent, must be put down to your wild accusation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rsquo; faltered Mrs. Krent, who  seemed to be anxious to propitiate the baronet. &lsquo;I only spoke wildlike;  although, sir,&rsquo; she added with emphasis, &lsquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t say this to everyone,  Bowring was afraid that you would kill him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Trevick, who was trimming his nails, did not look up.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bowring had no reason to think such a thing,&rsquo; he said  slowly. &lsquo;It is true that we did business in Africa together, and that he did  not treat me over well. But he has made amends by leaving the money to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And folk think you killed him for the money, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They are wrong; I never left this place. Your story,  Mrs. Krent &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I said anything,&rsquo; she interrupted hastily;  &lsquo;folks should not have taken me at my word. I&rsquo;ll tell every one that you have  nothing to do with the murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you know who has, Mrs. Krent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, sir; no more than a baby unborn. But if you want  to stop folks&rsquo; mouths, sir, you can do it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In what way, Mrs. Krent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;By marrying your daughter to Morgan. Then the money  will come to the rightful heir and you&rsquo;ll be praised.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I would be blamed, if I allowed my child to marry a  lunatic.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no, oh, no,&rsquo; protested the housekeeper, fanning  herself with her handkerchief. &lsquo;Morgan ain&rsquo;t so very bad. He&rsquo;s easily guided,  though I don&rsquo;t deny that he has his bad times. Me and Jenny are fond of him in  a way. What are you going to do about him, Sir Hannibal?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought about the matter yet,&rsquo; said the  baronet fretfully, and looking weary. &lsquo;I am very much troubled over all these  rumours which accuse me of the crime. But I cannot adopt the course you  suggest. Dericka cannot possibly marry Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, sir&rsquo;&mdash; Mrs. Krent spoke in a musing tone, but  her little red eyes glanced furtively at Trevick&rsquo;s face &mdash;&lsquo;suppose you give out  that Miss &mdash; Miss &mdash; I mean you daughter, sir &mdash; will marry Morgan, folk would  then shut up. I&rsquo;ll do my best to stop the scandal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My daughter cannot marry Morgan,&rsquo; said the baronet  again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can say that she will,&rsquo; urged Mrs. Krent; &lsquo;only  to stop folks talking, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked Trevick, and the question  was mentally asked also by the unseen listener.</p>
  <p>Neither Sir Hannibal nor Miss Stretton could understand  this mysterious conversation of the housekeeper, who seemed to have, as the  saying is, something up her sleeve. She smiled significantly at Trevick&rsquo;s  question.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll make it right for me, sir, I&rsquo;ll make it  right for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Again I must ask your meaning, Mrs. Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;See here, sir.&rsquo; Mrs. Krent spread out her podgy  hands. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a plain woman, who ain&rsquo;t been well treated. If you&rsquo;ll swear on  this,&rsquo; she pulled out a small Bible, &lsquo;that you&rsquo;ll let me have one thousand a  year I&rsquo;ll put things right for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say that you know who killed Bowring?&rsquo;  asked Trevick, pushing back his chair violently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. Krent tartly; &lsquo;but if  you&rsquo;ll swear to give me the one thousand a year and then announce that your  daughter is to marry Morgan you&rsquo;ll get back your reputation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see how &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you won&rsquo;t, sir, until you swear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She held out the book.</p>
  <p>Anxious to know what she meant, and really in a  dilemma as to how to reinstate himself in the eyes of St. Ewalds, the baronet  hastily snatched at the Bible. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one thousand a year if you put  things straight,&rsquo; said he, then added a solemn oath and kissed the book.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, then,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, taking it back again  with a smiling face, &lsquo;you can say that Miss Trevick&rsquo;s to marry Morgan, and folk  will never believe that you killed his father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My daughter must not marry Morgan,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal  for the third time.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent, triumphantly, &lsquo;for  Morgan&rsquo;s married already, and to my daughter Jenny.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter  VII<br>
    Retreat</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;Morgan married already; and to your daughter Jenny?&rsquo;  repeated Sir Hannibal wonderingly, then his face cleared. &lsquo;That will certainly  make matters easier.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course, sir. Miss Trevick can&rsquo;t marry the poor  boy, seeing he&rsquo;s my daughter&rsquo;s husband. So you see, sir, if you appear willing  to let Morgan, who is the rightful heir, have the money by marrying your  daughter people will say that you are innocent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you there,&rsquo; responded the  baronet dryly. &lsquo;However, people will certainly see that I wish to do what is  right if I announce a possible marriage. Nevertheless, if such could take place  I should refuse to make such an announcement.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It can never take place,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent eagerly,  &lsquo;seeing that Morgan is my son-inlaw. Give me and him and Mrs. Bowring, my  daughter Jenny, one thousand a year and the Grange to live in and I&rsquo;ll soon put  it about that you, sir, are as innocent as an unborn babe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Grange? Mrs. Krent, you are adding to your  bargain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Like all ill-bred women, Mrs. Krent easily lost her  temper. Now that she had secured so much she appeared to think that she could  do what she pleased with the easy-going baronet, and rose in a fine rage. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m  sure it&rsquo;s little enough I ask,&rsquo; she cried harshly. &lsquo;Morgan is the son of  Bowring, and should have the whole sixty thousand a year. Why he should have  left it to you, sir, I don&rsquo;t know, but Bowring always was a scoundrel. But if  you don&rsquo;t give in to my fair demands I&rsquo;ll make it my business to bring home the  murder to you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nonsense; that is quite impossible.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing is impossible to one who is wronged,&rsquo; said  Mrs. Krent, doggedly, &lsquo;and I wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday, let me tell you, sir. Be my  friend, and it will be better for you; get my back up, and &mdash;&rsquo; Here Mrs. Krent  gasped, clenched her podgy fist, and looked volumes.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal thought it best to temporise. Certainly  the fact that Morgan was already married would help him greatly, as then he  could announce that Dericka was to become Morgan&rsquo;s wife. By this statement it  would appear that the money had been left on such a condition by the dead man,  and so any possible motive for Sir Hannibal committing the crime would be  removed. All he had to do was to announce the possible marriage, and then Mrs.  Krent would appear to state that it was too late. Afterwards Sir Hannibal  reflected that he would play the patron to the extent of one thousand a year;  but he was not very anxious to give up the Grange as he wished to live there  himself.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One thing at a time, Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; he said  judiciously. &lsquo;You shall have the money, and meanwhile can live at the Grange  until I make up my mind what course to pursue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent nodded, and prepared to take her leave.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And if I were you, sir, I should go away to London at  once,&rsquo; she said seriously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why should I do that, Mrs. Krent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s market day,&rsquo; said the housekeeper, &lsquo;and folks is  talking of you having had a finger in this murder. If you went through the town  you would be mobbed; and I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rsquo; added Mrs. Krent  judiciously, &lsquo;if the market folk came up to this very house. The quarrymen were  fond of Mr. Bowring, who paid them well, and they&rsquo;d not make much ado about  ducking you in the sea, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal gasped.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How utterly preposterous,&rsquo; he said indignantly. &lsquo;If I  were guilty, if there were any feasible evidence against me, the police would  assuredly have arrested me long since. That I am free and respected should show  these misguided men that I have had nothing to do with the lamented death of my  friend.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Free, yes,&rsquo; sniffed Mrs. Krent, &lsquo;seeing as you are  rich and titled, there being one law for the rich and another for the poor. But  respected, sir? &mdash; just you go down to St. Ewalds and see. However, it&rsquo;s none of  my business. I go now, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One moment, Mrs. Krent. Where did this marriage take  place?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, no you don&rsquo;t, sir. Until I get that money I hold  my tongue. You can&rsquo;t prove anything without me, and in spite of your oath, I  don&rsquo;t trust you over-much. I believe that you do know something about this  murder, but for Jenny&rsquo;s sake I don&rsquo;t give you up. She wants money as Mrs.  Bowring, and you shall supply it, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal gasped again with indignation, but Mrs.  Krent swiftly removed herself from the room. The baronet was minded to follow  her and insist that she should prove her accusation, but on second thoughts he  reflected that such a course would be undignified, and remained where he was,  thinking deeply.</p>
  <p>His thoughts were not pleasant. He was well aware that  if an inquiry were made into his past, and all his doings in Africa with Bowring  were made public, that people would be more than ever certain that he had  committed the crime. He shuddered to think of the publicity of the whole  affair, and wondered if what Mrs. Krent proposed would really close the mouths  of the people. Ever since he had inherited the property he had been aware of  the sullen looks which greeted him when he went down the town, but it had never  struck him that the people would proceed to violence. Yet, when he reflected on  the rough characters of the Cornish folk, and their quick tempers, he saw well  that it would be best to refrain from going into St. Ewalds, or on to the moors  where the quarrymen lived. The fortnight which had elapsed since the reading of  the will had changed his life. Formerly he had been poor, but respected; now he  was rich, and suspected. Even as he thought of these things he heard in the  distance a sullen roar, which seemed to come from the direction of the town. At  once starting to his feet, he wondered if what Mrs. Krent had said was true, and  whether the quarrymen would come to assault him in his own house, so as to be  revenged for the death of their kind landlord. But the idea was too absurd, and  he brushed it aside with a rather quavering laugh. All the same, he wished that  Dericka were at hand to assist him with her common sense.</p>
  <p>It was then that Providence, as the baronet afterwards  believed, sent him assistance. It came in the shape of Miss Stretton, who stole  round by the terrace and presented herself at the window. She also had heard  the distant roar, repeated more than once, and from rumours she had heard was  not at all sure but what the prophecy of Mrs. Krent would be realised very  speedily. It was all the better for her plans, as she could rescue Sir Hannibal  and thereby gain his eternal gratitude.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Stretton &mdash; Anne,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, hurrying  towards the window, where she stood with one finger pressed to her lips. &lsquo;What  good fairy sent you here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My love for you brought me,&rsquo; said Anne, and stepping  into the room she closed the window to shut out another distant roar like the  sound of surf on a rocky shore.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Love?&rsquo; In spite of his perplexities Sir Hannibal  opened his arms. &lsquo;Oh, my dear, then you will marry me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Stretton brought out of her pocket a letter &mdash; the  very same she had carried when Penrith&rsquo;s jealous eyes had wandered to where it  was hidden.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You really mean this for a proposal?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is it not plain enough?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes. You ask me to be your wife, but you don&rsquo;t  say when.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;At this very moment, my darling &mdash; as soon as you can  marry me. We can go to the church this day, if you like.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In St. Ewalds?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne seated herself and, checking the caress with  which Sir Hannibal would have enveloped her, she raised a finger.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was in the next room while you were speaking with  Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; she said gravely. &lsquo;I did not intend to listen, but by chance I did  overhear a few words!&rsquo; This was a guarded way by which she hinted that she had  overheard the whole conversation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do not mind,&rsquo; cried the baronet impetuously, &lsquo;there  will be no secrets between us. You, then, know that Mrs. Krent accuses me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; but I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Believe it!&rsquo; echoed Sir Hannibal in a white fury; &lsquo;of  course not. I never had anything to do with the death. I was here all the time;  that is, I walked on the beach after you departed on that day, so as to think  of your sweet face, my own love.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Stretton had half a mind to mention about  Polwin&rsquo;s tale of the motor-bicycle, but on second thoughts she refrained.  Explanations could come later. Meanwhile she was anxious to get Sir Hannibal  away as soon as possible in case the quarrymen should come up to the house, as  a still continued roar told her they would.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal, taken up with admiring her face, and  never dreaming of peril, paid no attention to the ominous sounds.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I know that you are innocent,&rsquo; she said  quickly; &lsquo;all the same, people think that you are guilty, and the quarrymen  openly say that they will assault this house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nonsense, my dear.&rsquo; Sir Hannibal looked sceptical. &lsquo;England  is a country of law and order. In the wilds such a thing might take place, but  here &mdash;&rsquo; He shrugged his handsome shoulders.</p>
  <p>Anne threw open the window, and now the sound of angry  voices could easily be distinguished.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hearken,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;they are in the avenue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But the police &mdash; the police?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The police can do very little against an angry mob of  quarrymen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have the rascals locked up,&rsquo; said the baronet  fiercely.</p>
  <p>He was not at all afraid as his courage was too high  to be daunted by a riot.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is ridiculous that I should be accused of being  concerned in Bowring&rsquo;s murder. I shall address them,&rsquo; and he moved towards the  open window as several large men emerged from the belt of trees encircling the  lawns of the mansion.</p>
  <p>Anne drew him back and quickly closed the window.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said sharply; &lsquo;it would be useless to argue  with men inflamed with drink. Sir Hannibal, listen. It is just as well that I  came up. Mr. Penrith lent me his dog-cart for the day; I&rsquo;ll go down and get it  and drive round the back road which runs past this house. Slip out and join me,  and I&rsquo;ll drive you to the Gwynne Station. There you can board the London  express.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But by that I&rsquo;ll admit myself guilty,&rsquo; cried the  baronet in dismay.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s better to admit that than to be killed,&rsquo; retorted  Anne; &lsquo;and the quarrymen are in no humour to listen to excuses.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The police will arrest me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All the better; you will be safe in gaol. Come, Sir  Hannibal,&rsquo; she added impatiently; &lsquo;it is either London or prison. Will you  come?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The baronet thought for a few moments, and his  decision was assisted by a stone which smashed one of the windows.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rsquo; he said hurriedly; &lsquo;where am I to meet  you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In the back road in five minutes,&rsquo; she said quickly.  &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t wait to write to your daughter; I&rsquo;ll come back and explain. Get away to  the back at once; I&rsquo;ll meet the people.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal saw that discretion was the better part  of valour, and although it went sorely against his grain to fly he deemed it  was best to do so until he could explain his innocence under the shield of the  law. He therefore snatched a hasty kiss from Anne, and, putting on an overcoat  and a soft hat, went into the back parts of the house, where palefaced servants  were congregated. A word or two pacified these, and then their master slipped  out to the back road, where he waited uneasily for the dog-cart. Every moment  he expected to hear the sounds of his house being smashed, or to see and  infuriated mob of labourers pouring round the corner to kill him. It was a very  uncomfortable quarter of an hour.</p>
  <p>But Anne Stretton proved to be quite equal to the  occasion. She stepped boldly out on to the terrace through the broken window  and faced the crowd of angry-looking men. These looked surprised when they saw  her, and many voices demanded that Sir Hannibal should show himself.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal is not here,&rsquo; said Anne coolly, for she  knew that she was quite safe; &lsquo;he has gone to the Grange.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve just come from that direction, Miss,&rsquo; said a  rough voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He went by the other road, to see Mr. Morgan  Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The crowd paused. It might be true, and if this was  the case it would not be worth while to risk gaol by breaking into an empty  house. But one big man, quite a giant in stature &mdash; the same who had already  spoken &mdash; came forward.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know Sir Hannibal, Miss,&rsquo; he said hoarsely; &lsquo;tell  us if he killed the master.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Anne, holding her head very  high and speaking with the utmost assurance; &lsquo;but how do you know that I am  acquainted with Sir Hannibal?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You come out of the house, Miss,&rsquo; said the giant with  a grin, &lsquo;and I know you well, Miss. Don&rsquo;t you remember how I found the  sketchbook you had lost on the moors?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne looked attentively at the big man.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anak?&rsquo; she said with a flash of memory. &lsquo;Yes, I  remember you. We talked about Sir Hannibal; you are the foreman of the quarry  labourers he employs?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Bowring employs us, Miss,&rsquo; said Anak heavily;  &lsquo;Sir Hannibal let us and the quarry to Mr. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I remember. And you speak better than your fellows,  because you have been to school, and to &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Here her speech was interrupted by a growl from the  mob, who were weary of waiting. Anak was their leader, so Anne, seeing that no  time was to be lost if Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s house was to be saved from destruction,  spoke hastily. &lsquo;Take these men away, Anak.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They want Sir Hannibal, Miss.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You will find him at the Grange.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anak looked at her hard, and appeared to believe her.  With a loutish gesture he turned away and addressed his fellow-labourers. In a  few words he pointed out to them that the police would shortly be on the spot,  and that Sir Hannibal was at his ancestral residence on the moors. The speech  had a good effect, for in a few moments the mob of big, uncouth men were  running down the avenue again, leaving the Dower House untouched save for the  one broken window. Anne followed and found Penrith&rsquo;s dog-cart at the gate in  charge of the groom.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can tell Mr. Penrith that I will bring back the  cart in two hours to the hotel,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you want me to come, Miss?&rsquo; asked the groom,  hesitating.</p>
  <p>Anne whipped up the horse. &lsquo;There is no necessity. I  am going for a drive and will return in two hours.&rsquo; She was wise enough not to  mention her destination in case it should be suspected that she had aided the  retreat of Sir Hannibal.</p>
  <p>Shortly she found the baronet, with his hat well  pulled over his eyes and muffled up in his long coat. No words passed between  them, but Sir Hannibal swung himself on to the trap at once. In another minute  they were driving along the almost deserted road which led to Gwynne, a local  station some six miles distant from St. Ewalds. Only when they were clear of  the town did the baronet speak.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I cannot thank you sufficiently for your help,&rsquo; he  said gratefully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am only too glad,&rsquo; responded Miss Stretton, looking  at him with her bold, black eyes in a rather quizzical manner; &lsquo;but you must  think me very forward to come and overhear your private conversation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As I said, my dear girl, there need be no secrets  between us,&rsquo; replied Sir Hannibal eagerly, and would have possessed himself of  her hand but that she was holding the reins. &lsquo;Now that the ice is broken  between us, and you know that I love you, there is nothing you will not know.  And our marriage?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have not thought of that yet,&rsquo; said Anne  thoughtfully. The fact being that she did not intend to finally commit herself  until she could be quite sure that Sir Hannibal had the money. She had no idea  of marrying a pauper, however easy-going and well-preserved he might be.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why cannot we get married while I am in town?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What about your daughter?&rsquo; questioned Anne in her  turn.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka?&rsquo; Sir Hannibal waved his hand vaguely. &lsquo;Oh,  she will be quite pleased. She likes you, my dear Anne.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think she does,&rsquo; responded the lady dryly.  &lsquo;However, she cannot prevent our marriage.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly not; I am my own master.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where is she now?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She went out to see a friend and said that she would  not be back until late.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I fear she will be surprised to find that you have  gone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It cannot be helped, and I daresay she will soon  learn that the cause of my flight &mdash; for that it is &mdash; is due to the feeling  against me in St. Ewalds. By the way, have those rascally quarrymen sacked the  house?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no. I told them that you were at the Grange, and  they have gone there to look for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How clever you are. My dear girl, you are one in a  thousand. I have always admired and loved you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Further compliments of this sort passed between them  as they drove to Gwynne Station. Anne was certain that she now had Sir Hannibal  fast, and looked forward to becoming the mistress of sixty thousand a year. She  had some qualms of conscience regarding Penrith, whom she had led to believe  would be her husband; but she dismissed these when she thought of the brilliant  future before her. On the whole, Anne Stretton was thankful that matters had  turned out as they had done, as in this way she had been enabled to capture Sir  Hannibal. Not that he was a very shy bird, but it was necessary, as she had  frequently found in her career, to make absolutely certain. Many a time had she  proved the truth of the proverb, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s many a slip betwixt cup and lip.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But she would not have been so easy in her mind had  she known that Sir Hannibal, on stumbling into a first-class carriage, found  that his travelling companion was none other than Dericka. There she was,  comfortably ensconced in the corner, with a large bag packed away on the shelf  overhead.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka?&rsquo; cried her father in amazement; &lsquo;what are  you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am going to London,&rsquo; she replied, equally  astonished. &lsquo;And you, father, why are you going to town?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal explained, whereat Dericka was suitably  angered that her father should be suspected of such a vile crime. All the same,  when he had ended she significantly remarked:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is just as well that I am going to London to see  Oswald.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is that your reason for this secret journey?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. I knew if I asked you to let me go you would not  consent. And I know, also, that Oswald is the sole man who can help you to find  out who killed Mr. Bowring. I am going to stop with Aunt Lavinia, and then will  call on Oswald at the Temple and explain everything.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You should have told me, Dericka,&rsquo; fumed the baronet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; she answered calmly; &lsquo;you would only  have argued. It has been in my mind for several days to go up and see Oswald,  as I have been aware of the feeling against you. But I did not expect that it  would take the form of a demonstration such as you tell me about. You cannot  return to St. Ewalds, father, until your character is cleared.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And who will clear it, if it does need clearing?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oswald will clear it &mdash; at a price.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed! And the price, Dericka?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My hand,&rsquo; she answered, and Sir Hannibal grunted. He  recognised that he was in a hole, and needed all the friends he could muster.  All the same, he was by no means pleased at the prospect of having a penniless  barrister as his son-inlaw.</p>

    An Amateur Detective</b></h2>
  <p>Miss Lavinia Quinton was the sister of Dericka&rsquo;s  mother, a wealthy spinster, who disliked Sir Hannibal as much as she loved his  daughter. She also liked Oswald Forde, and was disposed to forward his suit,  both on account of his good looks and because the baronet did not approve of  him as Dericka&rsquo;s suitor. There must have been some Irish blood in Miss Lavinia,  for she was always in the opposition, and would never cease to argue while she  had breath left in her spare body. Dericka was very fond of her, and Aunt  Lavinia approved of Dericka, saying that all the sense in the girl came from  her mother, which remark was a side slap at Sir Hannibal.</p>
  <p>The house of this odd personage was in a quiet  Kensington square, where the rents were high and the dwellers in the various  mansions well-to-do. Everything in that square went by clockwork, and the  Judgment Day would have found the inhabitants dressed in their best bibs and  tuckers ready to listen to the last trump. Miss Quinton herself was one of the  precise old ladies in the place &mdash; tall, slender and aristocratic-looking. Her  silvery hair was worn in the fashion of Marie Antoinette, and suited her  wrinkled, oval face with its arched nose and thin lips. She always dressed in  grey, like a demure nun, and like a nun she was given to religious works,  mostly concerned with an extremely high church round the corner. Walking very erect,  with her nose held aloft as though disdaining meaner clay, Miss Lavinia passed  for being proud and cold. Proud she certainly was, but not cold, as many a poor  person knew how warm hearted she could be when there was charitable work to be  done. But she assuredly possessed sharp eyes and a sharp tongue, and could make  herself eminently disagreeable on occasions. She chose to do so when Sir  Hannibal and Dericka arrived from Cornwall.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia, kissing Dericka warmly, and  greeting her brother-inlaw coldly; &lsquo;so you are here. Why?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought that I would come and see you, Aunt,&rsquo; said  Dericka, who knew that Miss Lavinia was pleased.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m! Your father has been making himself disagreeable  again?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never make myself disagreeable unless there is a  cause,&rsquo; said the baronet, coldly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You usually find cause,&rsquo; snapped the old lady.  &lsquo;Dericka looks pale, I notice. H&rsquo;m! Is Oswald Forde the cause of that, or &mdash;&rsquo;  Miss Lavinia&rsquo;s eye sought the tired face of her brother-inlaw.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing to do with it,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal  hastily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Papa is all right, Aunty,&rsquo; whispered Dericka quickly;  &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be hard on him, he is very worried.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;On account of that Bowring murder? H&rsquo;m.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you know of that, Lavinia?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All that I read in the papers. Well, the man&rsquo;s gone,  so there is no use in saying anything, but I never liked him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did not know that you knew him well, Lavinia?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I knew him much better than you think, Hannibal. You  told me about him when you came from Africa, and I made it my business to have  a few conversations with him when he came to town.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, in Heaven&rsquo;s name?&rsquo; asked the baronet, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For the sake of your good name, Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My &mdash; good &mdash; name?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly. You more than hinted that this Bowring had  done some shady business in South Africa, and as you were mixed up with him I  wanted to know what that business was, so that I might help you should occasion  arise.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was no need,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal testily.  &lsquo;Bowring and I did do business together in Cape Town, and he did not treat me  well. All the same, I was quite able to manage him. But if you are going to  make yourself disagreeable, Lavinia, I shall go to an hotel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And waste your money. Nonsense.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Money doesn&rsquo;t matter to me now, Lavinia. I am rich.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Indeed! And how did you make money?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t make it. Bowring has left me sixty thousand  a year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia, who was seated bolt upright in her  chair, fell back with a gasp of astonishment when she heard the news.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name why did he do that, seeing that he  has a son?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;An insane son,&rsquo; put in Dericka sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, revolving what Mrs. Krent  had said to him and anxious to set the rumour of an engagement going, &lsquo;the  money was left to me, in a way &mdash; on account of Dericka and Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The son? Well?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bowring wanted Dericka to marry Morgan, and I was, so  to speak, to hold the money in trust. The will did not put that in so many  words, but the hint is enough for me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hint! Hint!&rsquo; cried Miss Lavinia with rising anger.  &lsquo;Good heavens, do you mean to say that you want Dericka to marry a lunatic?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is no chance of that,&rsquo; said Dericka angrily.  &lsquo;Papa, you really cannot mean what you are saying. You would not like me to  marry that fearful creature?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is no chance of your marrying him, my dear; but  it will be as well to let everyone think that I am willing you should become  Morgan&rsquo;s wife so that some reason may be assigned for this money being left to  me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia looked at Dericka, and Dericka looked at  Miss Lavinia. It was the latter lady who spoke first.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then I can&rsquo;t explain just now,&rsquo; retorted Sir  Hannibal, wearily, and resting his head on his hand; &lsquo;but if you will wait  until Forde comes I&rsquo;ll make everything clear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed, Hannibal. And pray, have you asked Mr.  Forde to come to my house and without requesting my permission?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! No!&rsquo; interposed Dericka hastily, to prevent an  angry reply on the part of the incensed lady; &lsquo;I took that liberty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia rubbed her aristocratic nose.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is a liberty, my dear &mdash; that is, it would be if  anyone but yourself took it. I shall be glad to see Mr. Forde to dinner. Does  he know &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I sent a wire from the station asking him to come  here at seven.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And if you object to his coming here, Lavinia, I will  send another telegram and invite him to the Guelph Hotel, where I propose to  stay.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia was sharp, and not over fond of Sir  Hannibal, whom she regarded as a weakling. All the same, she was hospitable and  saw that her despised brother-inlaw looked worried.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear Hannibal, I should not think of your going to  an hotel,&rsquo; she said cordially; &lsquo;you must stop here. Your cab is there,&rsquo;&mdash; she  glanced out of the window on to the quiet square &mdash;&lsquo;and your luggage also? I  will send &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Her hand was on the button of the bell.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have no luggage, Lavinia.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The maiden lady&rsquo;s hand dropped. &lsquo;No &mdash; luggage?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. I left St. Ewald&rsquo;s in a hurry. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake  wait until Forde comes. I&rsquo;ll tell my story once, but not twice.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The spinster looked again at Dericka, but that young  lady shook her head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can give no explanation, Aunty. Father refuses to  enlighten me until he sees Oswald.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In that case we may as well drop the subject. But you  did not tell me, Hannibal, how you came up?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We came by the night train, Lavinia, and stopped at  the Guelph Hotel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you not come here?&rsquo; asked Miss Lavinia,  putting up a lorgnette and speaking severely. &lsquo;It is now three o&rsquo;clock in the  afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Aunty&rsquo;&mdash; it was Dericka who explained &mdash;&lsquo;I wanted to  come to you, and had I been travelling by myself I should have come on, however  late the hour. But father joined me at Gwynne Station, and said that we had  better stop at the Guelph Hotel instead of troubling you. We were shopping this  morning, and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You should have come here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to,&rsquo; said Dericka quickly. &lsquo;I sent a  wire, as I said, from the station when we arrived asking Oswald to come here  this evening, and did not wish to come until the afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; asked Miss Lavinia, snappishly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was my fault,&rsquo; interposed Sir Hannibal. &lsquo;I had to  see a doctor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, then the shopping excuse is a lie?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. We did do some shopping, Aunty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m! And why, Hannibal, did you see a doctor?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have had a shock.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What sort of a shock?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; Sir Hannibal rose and shook himself. &lsquo;Do stop  asking questions, Lavinia. The shock has to do with what I have to tell you in  the presence of Forde. As to the shopping, since I came away without baggage I  have had to get a few things.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Which are in the cab?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then, when you said that you had no luggage you told a&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Damn!&rsquo; cried the baronet, goaded beyond endurance.</p>
  <p>Far from being angry, Miss Lavinia seemed amused.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I apologise,&rsquo; she said with very good grace; &lsquo;I fear  my questions worry you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They do. And I apologise in my turn for bad  language.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I accept.&rsquo; Miss Lavinia smiled grimly and shook out  her grey skirts in a gracious manner. &lsquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll send Augustus&rsquo;&mdash; this  was the butler &mdash;&lsquo;to get your &mdash; your &mdash; purchases.&rsquo; Miss Lavinia was determined  not to say &lsquo;luggage&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;and you can amuse yourself here while I take Dericka to  her room.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal nodded and sat down again &mdash; he had risen  in his anger.</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia gave her instructions, and escorted her  niece to a very pretty bedroom next to her own. When the two were alone, and  the door was closed, the spinster turned on Dericka with a look which spoke  volumes. &lsquo;Marriage,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Whose marriage?&rsquo; inquired Dericka, smiling rosily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not yours, my dear. Hannibal&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The rosy flush died out of the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My father? Oh, you must be mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am very seldom mistaken,&rsquo; said the spinster  frigidly. &lsquo;Hannibal is one of those well-preserved old beaux who are the easy  prey of any adventuress who comes along.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; Dericka remembered that this was her term for  Miss Stretton. &lsquo;Do you mean &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anne. Of course I mean Anne. She is well-born, and  not bad-looking, even though she is older than she admits. She came to me some  months ago saying that she wanted to go to St. Ewalds to join that art school  there, and asked me to give her a letter of introduction or two. I think myself  she is an adventuress, but I had a regard for her poor father. I therefore  introduced her to you, my dear. But it never struck me that she would make love  to your father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She has done so, however,&rsquo; said Dericka swiftly, &lsquo;and  I rather think that father admires her.&rsquo; And she related the conduct of Miss  Stretton at the fete. &lsquo;I believe father will marry her,&rsquo; ended Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia, who had listened grimly;  &lsquo;and foolish I was to send her to you, my dear. Of course, I knew that your  father was poor and that Anne wanted to marry money, so, even if such a thought  had crossed my mind, I should not have considered your father to be in any  danger. However, the mischief is done. What your father wants to explain to Mr.  Forde is that he is willing you should become his wife provided you are willing  to receive Anne as a step-mother.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t like her, Aunty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Neither do I. All the same, I have nothing to say  against her. She is decent enough, although her career has been a somewhat  Bohemian one. Now that your father has this money she&rsquo;ll marry him. It would  have been better had your father remained poor and free. However, my dear  Dericka, there is nothing to be said. You marry Oswald, and out of this Bowring  money your father can well afford to give you a magnificent income.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But father&rsquo;s talk about my marriage with Morgan?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; said the maiden lady; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand  that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They discussed the matter at length, but could come to  no conclusion, since they were in the dark as regards Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s  conversation with the housekeeper. Dericka was also in the dark on that  particular point, although she knew that Sir Hannibal had been driven by a  popular demonstration from St. Ewalds. It was this, she guessed, that her father  intended to speak about to Forde, and her heart leaped as she thought that Sir  Hannibal intended to ask for Forde&rsquo;s assistance.</p>
  <p>That would only be given on condition that Sir  Hannibal sanctioned the engagement, so Dericka thought that her course of true  love would run smoothly after all. She was on the point of explaining this to  her aunt, when she remembered how she had protested that her father had not  enlightened her as to the reason of his coming to London. If she admitted what  had been told her in the train, Miss Lavinia would probably accuse her of  deceit, and there would be trouble.</p>
  <p>She therefore judged it best to pretend ignorance and  to let Sir Hannibal tell his story to Forde and the spinster in his own way.  Dericka had not intended to wilfully deceive her aunt, but Miss Lavinia was so  very difficult to handle &mdash; a prickly thorn, in fact &mdash; that she had been hurried  into a denial without thinking.</p>
  <p>However, things went on very smoothly until Forde  arrived. Miss Lavinia gave father and daughter afternoon tea in the most  fragile of china, and refrained from hinting at her suspicions regarding Miss  Anne Stretton. She made herself so agreeable, in fact, that the baronet, not  thinking what lay behind the smooth, bland mask, thought it would be easy to announce  his intended marriage, particularly as on that hung the future of Dericka with  Forde.</p>
  <p>Forgetting nearly how he had been driven from his home  &mdash; Sir Hannibal had a wonderfully forgetful temper &mdash; he expanded in the amiable  atmosphere of the spinster&rsquo;s house until Miss Lavinia said to herself privately  that her despised brother-inlaw was really a fascinating man. Dericka also was  pleased to see the wrinkles of vexation vanish from her father&rsquo;s brow; and when  the barrister arrived, the party of three were all merry and genial.</p>
  <p>Oswald looked slim and dark and handsome in his dress  clothes, and he greeted Dericka with great fervour. Sir Hannibal also was in  evening dress, as he had managed to get a suit from somewhere &mdash; from his  tailor, in fact.</p>
  <p>That tradesman had made clothes for his customer, but,  not having been paid, he had retained them. Sir Hannibal, however, had  announced his succession to a fortune and had paid the bill with money received  from Mr. Gratton, so the tailor had handed over the new and fashionably-made  suit.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal never said anything about this, and Miss  Lavinia wondered how he had procured dress clothes which fitted him so well.  However, she refrained from making further comment on his want of luggage, and  mentally observed that London did not contain any finer specimens of young and  old men than Sir Hannibal and the barrister.</p>
  <p>After the first greetings were over Forde asked what  happy chance had brought Dericka and her father to London.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal would then and there have related all,  but Miss Lavinia insisted that dinner should not be upset by any fevered  discussion. Only when dinner was over &mdash; and a very good dinner it was &mdash; and the  quartette were gathered in the drawing-room sipping coffee, did the maiden lady  nod in the direction of her brother-inlaw.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, then, Hannibal,&rsquo; said she, sitting up alertly,  &lsquo;you can tell us what brought you to London.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have been driven from St. Ewalds,&rsquo; said the baronet  bluntly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Driven from St. Ewalds?&rsquo; cried the spinster, and  Forde echoed her.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Sir Hannibal gave a detailed description of all  that had taken place, and how Miss Stretton had driven him to the Gwynne  railway station to escape the fury of the quarrymen. Miss Lavinia nodded her  approval.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anne has a head on her shoulders,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;you  might do worse.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked Sir Hannibal colouring.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have eyes in my head, and I know Anne very well,&rsquo;  retorted Miss Lavinia. &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t do any thing without expecting payment.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You wrong her, Lavinia; you wrong her. She is as  simple as a child.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are, you mean, Hannibal. However, we can discuss  that later. What is to be done? Your position is really very disagreeable.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lavinia, you don&rsquo;t accuse me of murder?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If I did you wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting in my drawing-room,&rsquo;  said the old lady sharply. &lsquo;No. You are foolish in many ways, and why my poor  sister married you I can&rsquo;t tell. However, we must get you out of this  difficulty, that is certain. Oswald?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am at Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s service,&rsquo; said the barrister.  &lsquo;The position, as you say, Miss Quinton, is difficult.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I said disagreeable.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then both disagreeable and difficult,&rsquo; broke in  Dericka impatiently. &lsquo;What is to be done?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only one thing can be done,&rsquo; said Forde very  decisively. &lsquo;I must learn who killed Bowring, and prove the innocence of your  father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That will not be easy,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps not; but things can be made plainer if you  will tell me all you know about Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is very little to tell. I did business with him  in Africa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What sort of business?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was connected with diamonds,&rsquo; muttered the baronet  reluctantly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And Bowring treated you badly?&rsquo; remarked Miss Lavinia  keenly; &lsquo;at least you said so to me several times.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bowring was a scoundrel,&rsquo; cried Sir Hannibal much  agitated, &lsquo;but he has made amends by leaving me his money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;On condition that I marry Morgan?&rsquo; said Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. You heard the will read yourself, Dericka. That  was only a suggestion on the part of Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And one you wish to carry out,&rsquo; snapped Miss Lavinia,  tartly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Forde, turning red and looking from Miss  Lavinia to the baronet in an anxious manner.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Permit me to explain,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal hastily, and  detailed the conversation with Mrs. Krent.</p>
  <p>Dericka was much surprised. Nevertheless, she objected  to be made a catspaw for Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s safety, even though the position was  perilous.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; she added, after raising some objections,  &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see, father, how any such announcement would help you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It would show that the money was left to me in trust  for you and Morgan, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You would have to make over the money to him, then?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. Because Mrs. Krent would come forward and tell of  the marriage with her daughter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia sniffed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It seems a very roundabout way,&rsquo; she observed. &lsquo;I  think the best thing to be done, Hannibal, will be for Mr. Forde, here, to take  up the case and clear your character.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am willing &mdash; on conditions,&rsquo; said Forde, and looked  at Dericka.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal bit his lip. He was not very anxious to  make Forde his son-inlaw, as, now that he was rich, he wanted Dericka to  strengthen the Trevick family by making a titled alliance. However, he was in  such a difficult position that he had to consent; and he did so the more  willingly as he wanted someone in the family to delve into his past rather than  a stranger. With this in mind he nodded.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am willing that you should marry Dericka as soon as  my character is cleared,&rsquo; he said reluctantly.</p>
  <p>Forde rose with a joyful exclamation and, clasping  Dericka in his arms, kissed her fondly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your character will be cleared in a month, Sir  Hannibal,&rsquo; he said determinedly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; murmured Miss Lavinia.</p>
  <p>She was watching the baronet&rsquo;s face, and did not  approve of the nervous, agitated look thereon.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter  IX<br>
    The Steward&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>Oswald Forde was not displeased at the chance which  had turned him into an amateur detective, since he was a briefless barrister  who found time hang rather heavily on his hands. He was extremely clever, and  possessed a small income, so he waited patiently hoping that clients would in  due course come to his door.</p>
  <p>As yet, few had made their appearance, so Forde wanted  some occupation upon which to break his active mind. To solve a mystery was  pleasant, especially as its solution meant the gaining of a beautiful wife with  a substantial dowry. Forde was romantic, but also he was modern enough to  appreciate the advantages of money being joined by love. He therefore readily  assumed the position assigned to him, and prepared to start for St. Ewalds the  day after that momentous conversation.</p>
  <p>Then, to his surprise, Miss Quinton declared that she  would come also so as to chaperone Dericka. The girl wished to return to St.  Ewalds, if only to show that she despised the feeling which had driven her  father from the town.</p>
  <p>To do Sir Hannibal justice, he was also willing to  return, but Forde strongly advised him to remain in town until the mystery was  solved. The quarrymen were not capable of receiving truths unless these were  made extremely plain to their somewhat dull minds, and would probably make another  assault on the Dower House. When the true murderer of John Bowring was  discovered then the maligned baronet could go back and pose as a martyr.</p>
  <p>Dericka, however, insisted upon returning, and Miss  Quinton, for obvious reasons, insisted upon coming also.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do for you and Mr. Forde to travel alone,&rsquo;  said Miss Quinton; &lsquo;you know how people gossip, Dericka!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I despise gossip,&rsquo; exclaimed Dericka indignantly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So do I. All the same, one can&rsquo;t ignore it if one  wants life to be pleasant. It was gossip which drove Sir Hannibal from St.  Ewalds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka assented. &lsquo;Though I can&rsquo;t understand anyone so  silly as to believe that papa had anything to do with the matter. He was at the  fete about the time the crime occurred.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure of that, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Aunty! You don&rsquo;t believe &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear, I believe nothing against your father.  Whatever Hannibal may be, he certainly is too good-natured a man to commit a  crime. But you know from what he said last night that he left the grounds after  Miss Stretton and Mr. Penrith drove away and went down to the beach. No one saw  him there as the place was deserted, so he cannot prove an alibi. When did you  see him again on that day?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not until dinner, Aunty. I was looking for him at the  time Mr. Bowring started for the Grange as I wanted to confront him with Mr.  Bowring about this proposed marriage with Morgan. I could not find papa,  however &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course not; he was walking on the beach.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then he must have walked there for some hours, for he  did not appear until dinner was on the table.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you ask him where he had been?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. Papa dislikes being questioned; and then during  the dinner came the news of that terrible death, and I never thought of asking  questions. Why should I have thought,&rsquo; demanded Dericka indignantly, &lsquo;seeing  that I never doubted my own father&rsquo;s innocence?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No one doubts it now, dear,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia,  soothingly. &lsquo;It is only that horrid Mrs. Krent who started the rumour, and no  doubt she is sorry now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any reason why she need be sorry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; replied the old lady tartly, &lsquo;if she cannot  discredit her own story. Hannibal certainly will not pay her the income he  promised.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, he will,&rsquo; contradicted Miss Trevick, quickly.  &lsquo;Oswald thinks it will be as well to say that I am to marry Morgan, so that  people may think Mr. Bowring left the money to him in trust for both of us, and  so do away with any possible motive for the commission of the crime by papa.  And unless Mrs. Krent is paid the one thousand a year she will refuse to state  where her daughter was married to Morgan, and, then, oh &mdash;&rsquo; Dericka shuddered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The question is whether such a marriage did take  place. However, Mr. Forde can see Mrs. Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He intends to see everyone, and will begin with  Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is Hannibal&rsquo;s steward?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. He came from Africa, where papa knew him very  well.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your father seems to have known many people in  Africa,&rsquo; observed Miss Lavinia, dryly, &lsquo;and not reputable people, either.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Polwin is reputable enough,&rsquo; said Dericka  cheerfully; &lsquo;a quiet and timid man. He superintended the preparations for the  fete, and Oswald wishes to learn if he knows anything of that death&rsquo;s head.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I should think Miss Warry would know of that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, dear me, no, Aunty. She saw the skull, and  fancied papa had placed it there, which he did not. Who placed it there, and  why it should have been brought to the tent, is as strange as the fact that Mr.  Bowring was afraid of it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia applied herself to her smelling-bottle.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is all very strange and very unpleasant,&rsquo; she said  with a shrug; &lsquo;however, the only thing I can do I am doing, and that is to  support you at the Dower House during the enforced absence of your father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This conversation took place in the railway carriage,  while the Cornish express rushed westward. Forde had gone to the smoking  compartment for twenty minutes, so Dericka and her aunt had an opportunity of  talking; but the discussion, as can be seen, had ended in a somewhat futile  manner. However, one thing was clear to the girl, that Miss Quinton would stand  by her in the very trying position in which she was placed. It was not very  nice to return home as the daughter of a suspected murderer.</p>
  <p>Forde took up his quarters at the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Arms&rsquo;, an  excellent hotel in the heart of the town He could have gone to a more  fashionable place on the brow of the hill, which overlooked St. Ewalds, but  purposely remained near the market-place &mdash; where the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Arms&rsquo; was situated  &mdash; so that he might hear any gossip, and be on the spot to contradict it should  it touch on the supposed guilt of Sir Hannibal Trevick. The hotel was  comfortable, and Forde being a pleasant young man soon made himself a favourite  with the chattering landlady. But that important personage was too discreet to  repeat tittle-tattle, even although Forde had known her for five years, from  the time he had first come to St. Ewalds. Aware of her long tongue, without  doors if not inside, he judged that she would be the best person to spread the  news of a possible marriage between Dericka and Morgan Bowring.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose you have heard the news, Mrs. Tregar?&rsquo; said  the artful barrister, when the landlady came to his sitting-room to see if he  was perfectly comfortable.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, sir. What is it, if I may make so bold as to  ask?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The late Mr. Bowring left all his money to Sir  Hannibal Trevick &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I know that, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In trust,&rsquo; went on Forde impressively, &lsquo;for Miss  Dericka and Morgan Bowring, when they marry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Tregar threw up her hands. &lsquo;Lord, sir, you do  astonish me. I thought you were to be the happy man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So did I,&rsquo; replied Forde, heaving an ostentatious  sigh. &lsquo;Miss Trevick and myself are very much in love with one another, but by a  family arrangement she is to marry Morgan; that is why Sir Hannibal got the  money &mdash; in trust, remember.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed, sir. I thought &mdash; I thought &mdash; well, you  see, sir, everyone, knowing that Sir Hannibal is hard up, thought that he had  murdered Mr. Bowring to get the money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What nonsense. Why, even if Sir Hannibal had  committed such a crime &mdash; which, mind you, Mrs. Tregar, is not at all probable &mdash;  he would not have got the money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But it is said, sir, that Mr. Bowring told Sir  Hannibal at the fete that he had made a will in his favour, and then Sir  Hannibal killed &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde did not allow her to finish, but burst into a  hearty laugh.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never heard such rubbish,&rsquo; said he with a shrug;  &lsquo;why, Mrs. Tregar, where are your brains and those of the people hereabouts?  Sir Hannibal did not leave the fete, and was in his own house when the crime  was committed. Besides, an old man like that could scarcely get to such an  out-of-the-way place quicker than a powerful motor-car.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Begging your pardon, sir,&rsquo; contradicted Mrs. Tregar,  swelling with importance, &lsquo;but they do say that Sir Hannibal left the fete long  before Mr. Bowring did, and went by a different route to the place on his  motor-bike. And we know,&rsquo; she added with emphasis, &lsquo;that Sir Hannibal does ride  a motor-bike.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This story was new to Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who says that?&rsquo; he asked sharply, and wondering if  the tale was true.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Polwin, for one, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s steward?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, sir. Mr. Josiah Polwin; and, being the preacher  also at Gwynne Chapel, he wouldn&rsquo;t tell a lie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How does Mr. Polwin substantiate his statement? &mdash; no,  stop! I won&rsquo;t have the story second-hand. Send a note to Mr. Polwin and say  that he is to come here and see me. I have a message for him from Sir  Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you see him in London, sir?&rsquo; asked the landlady  eagerly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. He is very indignant at the way in which he has  been treated.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, sir, he&rsquo;s not so indignant as the quarrymen,  seeing that Miss Stretton sent them on a fool&rsquo;s errand to the Grange. They went  there, and nearly scared Mrs. Krent out of her wits when they found Sir  Hannibal wasn&rsquo;t there, as Miss Stretton said. She has had to keep quiet, as the  quarrymen are so angry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say that they would attack her for  saving the property of Sir Hannibal from an unprovoked assault?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They are angry, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Tregar, evasively.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where are the police?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, the police are looking after the matter, sir, and  questioned Miss Stretton. She told how she had driven to Gwynne Station with  Sir Hannibal, and the police are now watching the house she is staying at, so  that she may be safe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Tregar, all this is simply ridiculous. Miss  Stretton has more brains in her head than all your people. Were Sir Hannibal  guilty in any way, did the evidence point ever so slightly towards him as the  author of the crime, he would have been arrested by the police. He is  absolutely innocent, and has gone to town to complain about the quarrymen to  the proper authorities. There will be some trouble over this riot, as it may be  called.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I know very little about it, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.  Tregar, rather scared, and promptly disclaiming having anything to do with the  matter. &lsquo;I never did believe, myself, that Sir Hannibal had anything to do with  killing the poor gentleman, in spite of Mr. Polwin&rsquo;s talk.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear that,&rsquo; said Forde dryly, &lsquo;since it  is Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s intention on his return to sift this matter to the bottom and  to punish those people who have maligned his character. Also, he will have the  leader of the rioters arrested.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Anak,&rsquo; said Mrs. Tregar, decisively.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who is Anak?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, sir, it&rsquo;s not rightly known. His mother is an  old witch.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What rubbish, Mrs. Tregar.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s truth, sir. Anak is called so because he is so  big; but his mother, Mrs. Carney, was deserted years ago by her husband, and  now she lives near the quarry and gets her living by telling fortunes. Anak  works in the quarries, and he led the men to the Dower House.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In that case he will go to gaol, Mrs. Tregar. People  cannot do these things without suffering for them. and you can take it from me,  Mrs. Tregar, and you can tell everyone that Sir Hannibal Trevick is perfectly  innocent, since he was at the fete when the crime was committed, and also had  no motive for killing Mr. Bowring, seeing that the money has only been left to  him in trust for the marriage.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, it might be so, sir,&rsquo; said the landlady  doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is so, and you had better tell everyone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I will, sir; and I&rsquo;m sure you are a very kind young  gentleman to speak so of Sir Hannibal, when he is parting you from Miss  Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We are not parted yet,&rsquo; said Forde dryly. &lsquo;Sir  Hannibal wishes the marriage with young Bowring to take place, but Miss Dericka  objects.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And quite right, too, sir, seeing what a handsome  young gentleman you are. To think that she should marry that mad creature  Morgan Bowring,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Tregar, raising her hands, &lsquo;is too awful.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You would like to see Miss Dericka married to me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course, sir, seeing how I have known you for years  and years, and Miss Dericka is a kind, good young lady.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then, Mrs. Tregar, you can do me a good turn by  telling everyone that Sir Hannibal is innocent on the grounds I have set forth.  He will then know that I have defended him, and perhaps will let me marry Miss  Dericka. Do you see?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, sir; but will he give back the money?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, a compromise of some sort will be arrived at,&rsquo;  said Forde easily, and not wishing to say too much; &lsquo;but help me and Miss  Dericka if you can, Mrs. Tregar. You know the way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The landlady nodded vigorously and withdrew to send a  message to Polwin and to spread the new gossip. Forde leaned back in his chair  and sipped his coffee, certain that he had done the best that could be done.  Once people began to believe that Sir Hannibal might possibly be innocent, and  once they heard that he intended to defend his good name, the probability was  that the scandal would die a natural death. The truth of Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s  innocence would soon filter down to the quarrymen, and then the baronet would  be able to come back and settle matters in his own way. On the whole, the train  had been fairly fired, and the consequent explosion would undoubtedly blow Sir  Hannibal back into the niche he had occupied before the crime had taken place.</p>
  <p>Mr. Polwin did not hesitate to obey the summons.  Within half an hour he made his appearance in Forde&rsquo;s sitting-room, a timid,  short, broad man, with pale eyes, and a blank white face like a full moon. He  was badly dressed in ill-fitting black clothes, and appeared wonderfully  harmless. A sheep would have shown more spirit. Mr. Forde thought it strange  that Sir Hannibal should employ so obviously foolish a man. On the face of it,  Josiah Polwin appeared incapable of managing any property, however small.  Standing first on one leg and then on the other, he faced the keen-eyed young  barrister, twisting a cloth cap in his hands and waiting to be addressed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. Polwin,&rsquo; said Oswald briskly, and  straddling his legs before the fire with his hands under his coat-tails, &lsquo;and  what is this tale you have been telling about your employer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What tale, sir?&rsquo; asked the other in a low, but not  unpleasant voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, that Sir Hannibal left the Dower House on a  motor-bicycle on the day, and about the time, Mr. Bowring was killed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pardon me, sir,&rsquo; replied Polwin meekly. &lsquo;I did not  spread such a report, nor did I accuse Sir Hannibal of having anything to do  with the matter. He certainly did go out that day, and on his motor-bicycle: I  met him on the road.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;On the road where the murder was committed?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, sir. On the other road, which runs behind the  hill.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then, to get to the spot where the granite fell Sir  Hannibal would have to scramble over the hill from the other road?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never suggested such a thing, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you speak of the matter at all?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin went on balancing himself, first on one leg and  then on the other, hesitating in his reply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was this way, sir. I was coming along the second  road as I had been to see Mrs. Carney &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She is Anak&rsquo;s mother?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin looked up swiftly, and then again dropped his  eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, sir. She is a poor woman, to whom I go  occasionally to carry a word of comfort. Her son Anak is employed in the  quarries, which Sir Hannibal let to Mr. Bowring. I had been to see Mrs. Carney  and was returning. Just outside the town on the second road, I met Sir Hannibal  on his motor-bicycle. He asked me if I had seen Mr. Penrith driving Miss  Stretton, as they had left the fete and he had come after them to give a letter  to Miss Stretton. I said that I had not.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I quite understand,&rsquo; said Forde. &lsquo;They went by the  first road, where the murder took place, and drove back when they heard the  shot. Well?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal then said that he wanted a letter given  to Miss Stretton, and asked me to take it, since he was wanted at the fete. I  took the letter and went along the second road on the motor &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How did Sir Hannibal return?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;On foot. He went back to the fete; at least, he said  that he would.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you catch up with Miss Stretton and Mr. Penrith?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, sir, because I was on the wrong road. They did go  by the first road, as you know. I travelled along on the motor-bicycle as far  as Mr. Penrith&rsquo;s place, where Miss Stretton was staying, and there I left the  letter. Then I came back again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;By the same road?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, sir &mdash; by the second road. I returned to the  Dower House, and some of the servants expressed surprise that I was riding Sir  Hannibal&rsquo;s bicycle, as he was so particular. I explained how the matter came  about.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Humph! The story is clear enough, and quite  exonerates Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon sir, but Anak &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; what about him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He declared to me that he saw Sir Hannibal near the  quarries, where the murder was committed.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter  X<br>
    A Strange Disappearance</b></h2>
  <p>Forde stared at the meek steward, scarcely believing  his ears when he heard what he was saying.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When did Anak say that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only the other day,&rsquo; replied Polwin. &lsquo;I have said  nothing about it to anyone, and beg you to observe, Mr. Forde, that I never in  any way accused Sir Hannibal of being concerned in this crime. All I said was  that Sir Hannibal went out on his bicycle. I expect the feeling against my  master arises from the accusation brought by Mrs. Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, you know of that, do you, Polwin?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, sir; everyone knows of it. Mrs. Krent makes no  secret that she thinks Sir Hannibal killed Mr. Bowring. That is, she did say  so, but lately she seems to have changed her mind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; rejoined the barrister, thinking of the  bribe which was to be paid to the malignant housekeeper. &lsquo;Mrs. Krent, as a  woman, would say things in a hurry, which were not true. You can see for  yourself, Polwin, that Sir Hannibal, having left you on the second road near  St. Ewalds, could not have got over to the place where the crime was  committed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Across the moors he could, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good heavens, man, do you insinuate &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing, sir, nothing,&rsquo; said the steward hurriedly.  &lsquo;Only Anak did say that he saw Sir Hannibal near the spot. I daresay he told  the quarrymen that, and so they went to wreck the Dower House.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Humph! Why should these quarrymen take up the cudgels  so warmly on behalf of Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, sir, Mr. Bowring was an extremely good master,  and paid them large wages.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal, who now again possesses the quarries,  will do the same.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal was never famous for liberality,&rsquo; said  Polwin dryly; &lsquo;and the quarrymen liked Mr. Bowring, who used to talk to them as  though he were one of themselves.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As I believe he was,&rsquo; snapped Forde, considerably  upset by the information of the steward. &lsquo;He was born hereabouts of poor  parents, and only became a gentleman, so-called, after he returned from Africa.  By the way, Mr. Polwin, did you know him there?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Slightly. He and Sir Hannibal did business in some  diamond transaction. I was very hard up in Africa, and there Sir Hannibal was  kind to me in giving me employment.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All the more reason that you should defend him now,  Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am perfectly willing to do so, sir,&rsquo; said the  steward earnestly. &lsquo;Believe me, Mr. Forde, I am deeply grateful to Sir Hannibal  for what he did for me. It was not I who set the rumour afloat, but Anak, and &mdash;  and &mdash;&rsquo; Polwin hesitated, &lsquo;and Miss Warry,&rsquo; he ended.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Warry!&rsquo; Forde stared in surprise. &lsquo;I thought she  had gone to London.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She is going, sir; but has not departed as yet. She  went to Mrs. Carney, who knows about fortune-telling, and had a talk with her.  Mrs. Carney asked her how she came to prophesy so truly, but she refused to  give an explanation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Naturally, seeing that she wishes it to be thought  that she prophesied the death from a knowledge of the unseen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe she did, Mr. Forde?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Polwin, I do not. Miss Warry knows something.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin nursed his chin in the hollow of his hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I believe she does, sir. She has stated very plainly  that she believed Sir Hannibal to be guilty. And what with her story and Anak&rsquo;s  story, and a perversion of what I said about my master having gone out on the  bicycle, the police are beginning to believe that Sir Hannibal is guilty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good heavens! Things are indeed becoming serious,  Polwin. But if the police suspect Sir Hannibal, why did they not arrest him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They would have done so, sir, had he not gone away.  At least, Miss Stretton says so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see Miss Stretton, and also Miss Warry. Where is  she?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin mentioned a quiet boarding house a stone-throw  from the mansion of Sir Hannibal.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see Anak also, sir?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly; he must have made a mistake.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t believe, sir, that Sir Hannibal killed  &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Assuredly I do not, Polwin,&rsquo; interrupted the young  man angrily. &lsquo;I can see no reason why Sir Hannibal should have killed Mr.  Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They say that the money &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde interrupted again. &lsquo;Ridiculous! Sir Hannibal  knew nothing about the will making him the heir. And, again, Polwin, you can  tell everyone that the money is left in trust for Miss Trevick and Morgan  Bowring on condition that they marry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin started and appeared disturbed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is that marriage likely to take place, sir?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps. At all events, Sir Hannibal is agreeable.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the young lady, sir? I thought,&rsquo;&mdash; Polwin looked  very directly at the barrister &mdash;&lsquo;that Miss Dericka had other views.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Forde again, and somewhat carelessly.  &lsquo;At all events I understand that such a match may take place. But you can see,  Polwin, that if the money was thus left there was no reason why Sir Hannibal  should murder Mr. Bowring. Unless,&rsquo; added Forde keenly, &lsquo;you, Mr. Polwin, know  of some reason.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How should I know, sir?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What about Sir Hannibal and Mr. Bowring in Africa?&rsquo;  asked Forde, abruptly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They were partners, sir, in some diamond  transactions.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And good friends?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I really cannot say, sir,&rsquo; said Polwin, coldly; &lsquo;they  appeared to be good friends.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said Oswald, rather dissatisfied. &lsquo;And the  skull?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What skull, Mr. Forde?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That placed in Miss Warry&rsquo;s tent by an unknown  person.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know nothing about that, Mr. Forde. Sir Hannibal  will be the most likely person to explain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal declares he knows nothing. Come, now,  Mr. Polwin; you must be aware of some circumstance in Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s past life &mdash;  in Africa, we&rsquo;ll say &mdash; which is connected with his fear of the skull.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I swear I know nothing,&rsquo; replied Polwin, a trifle  sullenly; then his face cleared and he looked pleadingly towards the young man.  &lsquo;Sir, I am only too anxious to be of service to Sir Hannibal, who has been a  kind and good friend to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That sounds genuine enough,&rsquo; said Forde, looking  keenly into the meek face of the steward. &lsquo;Well, Mr. Polwin, and what do you advise?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What you have already suggested, sir. See Miss Warry  and Anak and Miss Stretton and Mrs. Carney.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why Mrs. Carney?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Warry may have said something to her about her  prophecy of Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you told me that Miss Warry refuses to speak.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Carney told me so, sir, but Mrs. Carney may tell  you otherwise. I daresay Miss Warry paid Mrs. Carney to hold her tongue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde looked at the ground and moved the hearthrug  with his foot dreamily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There seems to be considerable muddling over this  matter, and I don&rsquo;t quite see my way. However, it will be best to do what you  say, Mr. Polwin. I&rsquo;ll see the people you mention.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And advise Sir Hannibal to keep away, sir,&rsquo; advised  Polwin earnestly, &lsquo;else he may be arrested.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That will be the very best thing that can happen,&rsquo;  said Forde in a grim tone. &lsquo;Sir Hannibal, being innocent, will have no  hesitation in facing his accusers.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin looked doubtfully at the barrister, and the  confidence the latter expressed in the baronet&rsquo;s innocence did not seem to be  shared by the steward. However, he said nothing, but meekly bowed and passed  out of the room. Oswald did not try to stop him. For the present he had learned  sufficient to advise him as to the next steps to be taken along the doubtful  path which led towards the light. In that light Forde expected to see the  assassin of John Bowring, and he did not think to find him in Sir Hannibal  Trevick. But Polwin, who had known the baronet longer than the barrister, did  not seem so certain that Sir Hannibal was innocent. Forde felt uneasy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; he thought, warming his hands, &lsquo;if there  is anything in Trevick&rsquo;s past life in Africa which would warrant his killing  Bowring. It seems to me that the Death&rsquo;s Head could clear up a lot, if its  significance could be known. Miss Warry also seems to have her knife into Sir  Hannibal, seeing what she said. I don&rsquo;t believe that she read her prophecy in  the stars. She knows something, and perhaps can explain the mystery of that  crowned skull. Humph! I&rsquo;ll call and see Miss Warry this very evening.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Having made up his mind to this course, Forde sent up  a note to Dericka saying that he would call in the morning. He had intended to  go up to the Dower House that evening, but thought it as well to postpone his  visit until such time as he had seen Miss Warry, and learned exactly what was  her attitude towards the baronet. Behind all the evidence which pointed to this  person and that, as the enemy who was engineering Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s destruction,  lurked an idea in Oswald&rsquo;s head that Miss Warry was the moving spirit. Yet he  knew that the exgoverness had been kindly treated by the baronet, and had no  reason to trouble him. But it might be that Miss Warry was one of those persons  who resent kindness, and who would be willing to hurt the person who was kind  for the very reason that the person had behaved well. Forde had come across  that sort of individual before.</p>
  <p>However, he postponed his decision until he had  interviewed the exgoverness, and meanwhile walked up to the boarding house  where she was stopping. It was a large granite house overlooking the bay, and  as comfortable as any place in St. Ewalds, if not more so. Two very charming  ladies owned the place, and ministered to the many guests who came to their  establishment, for it was wonderfully popular and quite deserved its  popularity. Miss Warry, who was fond of her comforts, could not have chosen a  more delightful abode.</p>
  <p>Forde sent in his card and was shown into a small  room, well furnished and illuminated by a tall lamp in a rose-coloured shade.  Consequently, when Miss Warry, gaunt and grey as ever, sailed into the room,  swinging her inevitable black velvet bag from her lean wrist, she looked quite  presentable in the rose-hued light. She was arrayed in a dark red cashmere  dress with a long train, perfectly plain and tightfitting. As Miss Warry had  not an elegant figure the excellent fit of her dress showed her angles in an  excessively unbecoming manner. Also she wore a paste star in her scanty hair,  and assumed a solemn manner. Her mincing ways and meek behaviour and nervous  tittering were things of the past. Emancipated from the thraldom of an inferior  position, Miss Warry had adopted a severe, imperative manner, which she thought  befitted her new role of prophetess.</p>
  <p>She greeted Forde with the air of one welcoming a  mourner to a funeral, and scanned him closely with her green eyes before  subsiding gracefully into an armchair. Forde could not help thinking that she  looked like a problem of Euclid, so angular did she appear. And, like such a  problem, Miss Warry, as he guessed, would be hard to solve.</p>
  <p>She began the conversation by giving him a shock.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This is sad news, Mr. Forde,&rsquo; she said in a deep  voice, and with a direct gaze.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To what particular sad news do you allude, Miss  Warry?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have you not seen the weekly paper which came out  today, Mr. Forde?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. I only arrived in St. Ewalds this day.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;With Miss Quinton and Dericka? I heard as much. But  how wise that Sir Hannibal did not come.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t see that, Miss Warry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, I forgot you have not read the paper. There is no  copy here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In that case, Miss Warry, perhaps you will tell me  what is the sad news you allude to.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry was only too pleased.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is stated that the police have found a clue which  leads them to believe that Sir Hannibal murdered Mr. Bowring, and he is to be  arrested. The warrant has been taken out,&rsquo; continued the exgoverness with  relish, and passing over Forde&rsquo;s exclamation, &lsquo;and a detective has gone to  London to arrest the assassin. How very sad.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You seem to be very certain that Sir Hannibal is  guilty,&rsquo; said Mr. Forde somewhat tartly, and recovering his self-possession.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;On these facts I am,&rsquo; said Miss Warry, serenely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What facts?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry forthwith launched into long explanations,  which dealt with the story of Polwin, considerably distorted, with the tale of  Anak, and with the marvellous truth of her own prophecy.</p>
  <p>Forde listened in silence, alert to seize on any new  point which might help him to solve the mystery of the millionaire&rsquo;s death. But  Miss Warry&rsquo;s story was only the same as he had learned from the steward. He did  not give the exgoverness the satisfaction of seeing what an impression she had  made on him, but looked at her serenely when she had finished.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t believe all this gossip,&rsquo; said  Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Gossip!&rsquo; echoed Miss Warry viciously. &lsquo;The police do  not take out warrants on gossip.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The truth of these tales has yet to be proved, Miss  Warry. I am quite sure that Sir Hannibal will willingly face his accusers.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In the dock, remember,&rsquo; she snapped, annoyed by his  coolness; &lsquo;not in the witness box.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so. You will probably be there, Miss Warry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; said Forde, rising to give due effect to his  words, &lsquo;that I am aware of this conspiracy which has been formed to wreck Sir  Hannibal&rsquo;s good name, and that I have undertaken to learn the truth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It will not be hard to learn,&rsquo; said Miss Warry,  coolly; &lsquo;my late employer killed Mr. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There I join issue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand law terms, Mr. Forde. But, of course,  you believe that Sir Hannibal is innocent since you are to marry Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, but I am not to marry Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; Miss Warry looked profoundly astonished.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;By the will of the late Mr. Bowring it is arranged  that Dericka shall marry Morgan Bowring. Sir Hannibal intends that such a  marriage shall take place. So you see, Miss Warry, that Sir Hannibal had no  reason to kill Mr. Bowring. He simply holds the money in trust, as it were, for  the young couple.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Warry sniffed and laughed in an artificial  manner.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pardon me, Mr. Forde, but I was present at the  reading of the will. There is no hard and fast assertion that such a marriage  shall take place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal thinks that he should yield to the  express wishes of his late friend.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;His late friend?&rsquo; scoffed the lady; &lsquo;his late enemy,  you mean.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How can you be sure of that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I know what I know,&rsquo; said Miss Warry in an  enigmatic manner. &lsquo;Your story of this possible marriage doesn&rsquo;t impose on me,  Mr. Forde. Sir Hannibal is not the man to give his daughter to a madman, and  you are not the lover to surrender a pretty girl such as Dericka is &mdash; to say  nothing of the fact that Dericka has too much common sense to allow herself to  be handed over to anyone. If you think to do away with the motive for the crime  by such an explanation, Mr. Forde, you have failed so far as I am concerned.  Sir Hannibal needed money, and he killed Mr. Bowring to get it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How can you tell?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell now,&rsquo; said Miss Warry quickly, &lsquo;and if  needs be I&rsquo;ll tell what you are about to hear in the witness box. You know what  I wrote in the letter which I gave Mr. Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; but I don&rsquo;t believe that you read it in his  hand.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did, and in the crystal,&rsquo; snapped the sibyl. &lsquo;But I  also had some grounds to go upon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; said Forde sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The crystal and the palm of Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s hand simply  confirmed what I guessed. I went into the house to get something for my  fortune-telling on that day of the fete, and about the time Sir Hannibal was  talking in the library with Mr. Bowring I was there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! Eavesdropping?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing of the sort,&rsquo; said Miss Warry, flushing all  over her sallow face. &lsquo;I wanted a book which was in the library which dealt  with fortune-telling, as I had to refresh my memory. I went to the library, and  when I heard voices I slipped behind a screen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you conceal yourself so unnecessarily?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Just because I didn&rsquo;t want anyone to think that I had  to refer to a book for my Art. You can call it weak, if you like, Mr. Forde,  but that is what I did. Well, then, when I was hidden behind the screen Sir  Hannibal came in with Mr. Bowring. They were quarrelling.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What about, Miss Warry?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Really, I cannot say exactly. It had something to do  with that skull and with a Zulu witch-doctor. They spoke in low, angry tones,  and as my hearing is not very good, and they were some distance away, by the  window, I could not hear all. But I did hear Sir Hannibal say he would kill Mr.  Bowring sooner than he should disgrace him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did Sir Hannibal use those words?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He did. So when I saw in the crystal and read in Mr.  Bowring&rsquo;s palm that he would die before he reached home, I guessed that Sir  Hannibal would fulfil his promise and kill him. And when I found Sir Hannibal  absent from the fete, I guessed that he had gone to kill his enemy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde pondered. &lsquo;This is all very strange.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Meaning that you don&rsquo;t believe me?&rsquo; snapped the lady,  rising.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, but &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is no but. I am very sorry that I told you  since you doubt my word. I decline to stay longer in your company.&rsquo; And Miss  Warry, in the most unexpected manner, swept out of the room before Forde could  stretch a hand, or say a word to stop her. It seemed to him that Miss Warry was  fearful lest he should question her, and therefore had made his doubts of her  story a feeble excuse to get speedily out of the room.</p>
  <p>He sent a message asking her to return, but she  refused to appear, and Forde had to return home to bed considerably bewildered  by the information she had given him. Whether it was true, or merely the invention  of a spiteful woman, he would not say, but undoubtedly it made things look  blacker than ever against Sir Hannibal Trevick. And even now he might be  arrested.</p>
  <p>Forde passed a bad night, as he foresaw trouble, and  could not think how such trouble was to be avoided. Trevick was in danger of  being hanged, seeing that the evidence against him was so strong and the public  feeling ran so high. Yet never for one moment did the barrister believe his  future father-inlaw to be guilty. But how to prove his innocence he could not  think, and thought it would be best to go to London again and have a  conversation with him regarding the crowned skull, which seemed to turn up  everywhere in this extraordinary case.</p>
  <p>But there was no need for Forde to leave St. Ewalds.  Just as he was preparing to go out Polwin appeared and made an abrupt  announcement:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal has disappeared,&rsquo; said Josiah Polwin.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter  XI<br>
    The Quarryman</b></h2>
  <p>It was as Polwin stated. Sir Hannibal Trevick had  disappeared.</p>
  <p>The detectives travelling by the night train had gone  to Miss Quinton&rsquo;s place to arrest him, and found that he had departed bag and  baggage on the previous night. On making inquiries it was learned from the  butler that the baronet had intended to go to the Guelph Hotel, thinking that  he would be less restrained in his movements there than in his sister-inlaw&rsquo;s  somewhat prim house. But the Guelph Hotel people had seen nothing of Sir  Hannibal from the time he had stopped there with his daughter.</p>
  <p>An inquiry at Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s club showed that he had  not frequented it of late, and the detectives could think of no place where to  look for him.</p>
  <p>Later on in the afternoon of the next day they  appeared at the Dower House to question Dericka and Miss Quinton. Luckily,  Forde had gone to the house and was on the spot to support the two ladies.</p>
  <p>The detective who paid the visit was a dark little  man, with a lean face and sharp black eyes. He sent in his card, which bore the  name Giles Arkle, and Dericka passed it along to Forde with a bewildered  expression. She already knew from Forde that her father had disappeared.  Polwin&rsquo;s information, learned from a friendly policeman who had no business to  disclose official secrets, was perfectly correct.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What does this man want to see me about?&rsquo; asked  Dericka, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rsquo; said Forde smoothly, and not guessing  for the moment that the visitor was a detective. &lsquo;Would you like me to see him  for you, dearest?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It will be best for Dericka to see him herself,&rsquo; said  Miss Lavinia, who was knitting near the window.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; replied the girl with a shrug and left  the sitting-room to go to the drawing-room, where the man awaited her.</p>
  <p>Forde looked uneasily at Miss Quinton, and she became  aware of his scrutiny.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; she asked, without raising her eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am wondering if this Arkle is from Scotland Yard.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Probably,&rsquo; replied Miss Quinton, unmoved.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You do not appear astonished or annoyed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am neither one nor the other,&rsquo; replied the old  lady, quite calmly. &lsquo;If Hannibal will mix himself up with shady people he must  take the consequences.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t think he is guilty, Miss Quinton?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I certainly do not. But from the rumours I have  heard, and from what you repeated of Miss Warry&rsquo;s information, I think that  Hannibal will have a difficult task to clear himself. He did right to hide.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rsquo; said Forde quickly; &lsquo;that  looks as though he was unwilling to face his accusers.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Probably he is,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia picking up a  stitch. &lsquo;Hannibal never can face the consequences of his own folly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I believe that there is a conspiracy against him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So do I, and it has to do with his doings in Africa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Quinton, do you know &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing; absolutely nothing. All the same, I have  conversed with Mr. Bowring, and from what I read in his face, and the few words  he let fall, I suspect that both himself and my brother-inlaw were engaged in  dealings which would not bear the light of day.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think Bowring was too clever a man to give himself  away in such a manner,&rsquo; said Forde dryly.</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia looked at him with her shrewd old eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can see through a brick wall as well as most  people,&rsquo; she said quietly, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t say that I know of anything against  either my brother-inlaw or this dead man. Nevertheless, I guess that things are  somewhat queer with both of them. But, of course, Bowring being dead, Hannibal  has to bear the burden of both.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you know of anything about the Death&rsquo;s Head?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not a thing,&rsquo; retorted Miss Lavinia, and would have  said more, but that the footman entered at the moment to request that Forde  would come into the drawing-room. With a swift glance at Miss Quinton, who  continued quietly to knit, Oswald followed the man, and found Dericka pale with  anger standing before the dapper little man.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This is a detective,&rsquo; she said, as soon as Forde  closed the door, &lsquo;and he wants to know if my father is hidden here. I have told  him that there is no need for my father to hide, but he does not believe me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am very sorry, Miss,&rsquo; said Arkle apologetically,  &lsquo;but business is business, and we want Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;An innocent man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, yes, Miss. Every man is presumed to be innocent  until he is proved guilty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How dare you mention guilt in the same breath with my  father?&rsquo; flashed out the girl. &lsquo;Oswald, make this man see sense.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear Dericka, he is only doing his duty, and we  must place no obstacle in the way,&rsquo; said Oswald calmly. Then he addressed Arkle  directly: &lsquo;Sir Hannibal Trevick is not here, I assure you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you know where he is?&rsquo; asked the detective  doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. If I did I should go to him and advise him to  submit to the law. Sir Hannibal is as innocent as you or I, Mr. Arkle, and can  easily defend himself against the calumny which pursues him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then why did he fly, sir?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka interposed, still angry. &lsquo;You have no right to  assume that he has fled.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Arkle looked sceptical. &lsquo;Sir Hannibal is not at Miss  Quinton&rsquo;s house in Kensington, nor at his club, nor has he returned to the  Guelph Hotel. Since he cannot be found, and there is a serious charge for him  to meet, I think, young lady, that I am right in believing he is unwilling to  face his accusers.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is not; you have no right to say that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He certainly fled from St. Ewalds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And why: because a set of uneducated quarrymen,  without knowing the truth, were prepared to take the law into their own hands.  They ought to be punished.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They will be, Miss Trevick. There is every chance  that the man called Anak will be arrested. He was the ringleader.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you know where Anak is?&rsquo; asked Forde quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Usually he is at the quarries. He lives with his  mother, a reputed witch, amongst the moors. Anak&rsquo;s true name is Hugh Carney,  and he is called Anak from the fact that he is six feet four high. However, I  have come here to ask, not to answer, questions. Sir Hannibal &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is not here,&rsquo; said Dericka sharply; &lsquo;do you doubt  my word?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear girl,&rsquo; said Forde in a low voice, as he saw  the detective bite his lip with annoyance, &lsquo;this is not the way to speak to a  man who is merely doing his duty. We know that your father is not here, so to  convince him let us allow Mr. Arkle to search the house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But the insult, Oswald.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear, things have come to a pass where insults do  not matter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka thought for a moment. Then her common sense  came to her aid and she saw that she had been unjust to the quiet little man,  who have behaved very well considering how objectionable was his errand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can search the house, Mr. Arkle,&rsquo; she said  abruptly.</p>
  <p>The detective looked hard at her. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it  will be necessary, Miss Trevick,&rsquo; said he politely; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for  it. But if Sir Hannibal does communicate with you it will be wise that you  should advise him to surrender.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That will be my business,&rsquo; said Forde determinedly;  &lsquo;I am quite sure that what you say is common sense, Mr. Arkle.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Arkle bowed and took his hat to go.</p>
  <p>Dericka stopped him. &lsquo;One moment, sir,&rsquo; she said  quickly; &lsquo;how did you know that my father was at Miss Quinton&rsquo;s in Kensington?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We learned that he had gone there with you from the  Guelph Hotel, Miss. Sir Hannibal left his address.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why did you go to the Guelph Hotel?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Arkle shrugged his shoulders. &lsquo;The men who came from  St. Ewalds, Miss, informed me that Sir Hannibal usually stopped there when in  town.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I understand. Well, Mr. Arkle, I can promise you that  should my father write to me I shall certainly advise him to give himself up.  You can take it from me that he is perfectly innocent. You must look in another  direction for the assassin of Mr. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Arkle glanced at the young lady sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps, Miss, you can tell me in which direction to  look?&rsquo; said he in silky tones.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I cannot. But my father was at the fete all the  time. Perhaps, Mr. Arkle, you will explain on what grounds you arrest him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly, Miss. I am not exceeding my duty in  telling you. Sir Hannibal and Mr. Bowring were not on good terms. At the fete  Mr. Bowring told Sir Hannibal that he had made a will leaving the money to him.  Sir Hannibal certainly was missing from the fete, and rumour says that he went  on a motor-bicycle to heave the mass of granite on to the road. As that failed  to kill Mr. Bowring it was then that Sir Hannibal shot him, and afterwards  regained this house by means of the motor-bicycle. Mr. Polwin can state that he  met Sir Hannibal on his bicycle, and Hugh Carney &mdash; that is, Anak &mdash; can state  that he saw Sir Hannibal in the vicinity of the quarries on the day and about  the time the murder took place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Arkle ceased, and, looking at Dericka, waited to hear  what comment she would make on his very plain statement.</p>
  <p>She held her tongue, however, and as Forde also did  not seem inclined to speak, the detective withdrew after a keen glance at both  of them. When the front door closed, and he was seen walking briskly down the  avenue, Dericka turned to her lover.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you think of all this?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that after I have seen Anak,&rsquo; replied  Oswald; &lsquo;I am going to drive out to the quarries now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One moment. Why should papa run away?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that he has. He will turn up here,  and then I&rsquo;ll persuade him to surrender.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka mused for a few moments, while Forde held the  handle of the door preparing to depart.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sophia is a spiteful woman,&rsquo; she said abruptly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you talking of Miss Warry?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course. She is trying to injure papa because &mdash; it  sounds very ridiculous, of course &mdash; but the fact is Sophia wanted papa to marry  her. Yes, you may laugh, but it is the truth. And because he would have nothing  to do with her she has made up this story of the quarrel in the library to get  him into trouble.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There may be truth in the story,&rsquo; said Forde  meaningly; &lsquo;after all, Dericka, you told me yourself that Bowring hinted your  father had threatened him with death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka changed colour. &lsquo;Hold your tongue about that,  Oswald.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly. But what do you think of the threat?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka looked contemptuous. &lsquo;It was only a sample of  papa&rsquo;s wild talk when he is angry. I expect Mr. Bowring and papa really did  have a quarrel, and both of them said more than they intended to say. It is  lucky Sophia did not overhear everything papa said in an unguarded moment and  when he was not responsible for his speech.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you think she really did miss anything?&rsquo; asked  Forde doubtfully; &lsquo;she struck me as a woman who would keep a lot back until  such time as she could make a dramatic announcement, the same as she did at the  inquest, about her prophecy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sophia is really deaf,&rsquo; replied Miss Trevick  thoughtfully, &lsquo;and if papa and his friend were near the window she certainly  would not hear much unless her ears were sharp. The screen, behind which she  was hidden, is at the other end of the room. No, Oswald, if she could have said  anything harmful to papa she would have let it out to you at that  conversation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet she left the room before I could question her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll question her,&rsquo; said Dericka decisively. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go  this very afternoon and ask her why she is maligning papa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You say that you know the reason?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sophia won&rsquo;t give that reason.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very good. I&rsquo;ll leave you to deal with the lady, and  I&rsquo;ll go out to see Mrs. Carney and her gigantic son.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This being arranged, Forde left the house, and Dericka  returned to report progress to Miss Lavinia. The young barrister procured a  trap at the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Arms&rsquo;, and after a light luncheon took his way to the  quarries, along the very road on which the murder had taken place.</p>
  <p>He was anxious to interview Anak and to learn why the  man was so persistent in making trouble. Trevick was not a man to have enemies,  as he was good-natured and indolent. Yet Anak went out of his way to implicate  the baronet in a crime of which he was assuredly innocent; and more, he had led  the quarrymen to wreck the Dower House. Such an attack was more likely to occur  in Russia than in a quiet Cornish watering-place; yet the assault had been  made, and that it had not succeeded was owing to the cleverness of Anne  Stretton. And at this point of his meditations Forde remembered that he had  also to interview the adventuress, as Dericka contemptuously called her, if  only to learn if she could in any way exonerate Sir Hannibal from complicity in  the murder.</p>
  <p>On this bright afternoon, under a clear blue sky  radiant with sunshine, the moors looked wonderfully beautiful. They ascended on  one side of the winding road, and fell away on the other towards the steep  cliffs, which breasted the placid ocean. The air was crisp and keen, and Forde  drew in long breaths as the trap spun along gaily behind the smart little pony.</p>
  <p>Passing over the scene of the murder, he looked up to  see the mutilation of the bank whence the mass of granite had fallen, and  looked also down the slope where the scattered fragments revealed how it had  been blasted by dynamite so as not to impede the traffic.</p>
  <p>Then round the corner of the next bend he came  unexpectedly upon Anak. There was no mistaking the giant, for there could not  be another such huge creature in the district.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that Hugh Carney?&rsquo; Forde asked the driver.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, sir; Anak, we calls him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can stop here,&rsquo; and Forde leaped from the trap to  walk forward and confront the big man. Anak, who was walking towards the ragged  rent in the high bank which led to the quarries, turned his head at the sound  of approaching footsteps and waited when he saw Forde make a signal that he  should stop. The man, bulky, brawny and animal, towered above the slim  barrister, although Forde was not a short man by any means. He had the  immovable face of an ox, heavy, bovine, and a trifle sullen. In his clothes,  rusty with the grime of the quarries, with a shock of red hair, and a tangled,  untrimmed beard of the same, Anak looked like one of those famous giants of Cornish  lore whom Jack killed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are Hugh Carney?&rsquo; asked the young man briskly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am Anak,&rsquo; replied the giant, without much civility.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So I understand, and I think that the name fits you  very well. I am Mr. Forde, and I am acting on behalf of Sir Hannibal Trevick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>At the sound of the name Anak scowled and clenched his  mighty fist in a savage manner.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;d better keep out of my way,&rsquo; he growled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; answered Forde lightly; &lsquo;and why?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got my own reasons.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell them to me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why should I?&rsquo; demanded Anak, still growling.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My friend, you are in danger of arrest for having led  that mob of men to the Dower House. I can help you in this matter if you will  help me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Help you in what?&rsquo; grumbled Anak, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To clear the character of Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m hanged if I do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be imprisoned if you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Forde  sharply. &lsquo;Come, now, you must be reasonable. Do you want to be arrested?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to see the man who would arrest me,&rsquo; and  Anak swung his arms fiercely.</p>
  <p>The barrister looked at the fine animal critically.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have been to school, I should say?&rsquo; he remarked,  irrelevantly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What if I have?&rsquo; growled Anak on the defensive.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Simply this. You have had some education, as I notice  that you speak better than most of your class round about these parts. You  should therefore know that the law is not to be defied by brute strength, which  is all the strength you possess, my friend. All your thews can do nothing  against a couple of policemen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d take a dozen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am quite sure the dozen would be forthcoming,&rsquo; said  Forde dryly, &lsquo;and in any case you would have to go to gaol. I can save you from  this if you answer me a few questions.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>These arguments appeared to have some weight with the  big man, and he kicked a stone out of his way as he replied: &lsquo;What do you want  me to say &mdash; sir?&rsquo; He added the term of respect grudgingly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you lead those quarrymen to the Dower House?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because Sir Hannibal killed Mr. Bowring. He was a  good master, was Mr. Bowring, and gave good wages. No wonder we&rsquo;re angry at him  having been done to death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But not by Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes he was; I know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I saw Sir Hannibal on the moors near here at  the time the rock was heaved over.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come, now, you&rsquo;re not going to persuade me that so  delicate a man and so old a man as Sir Hannibal Trevick threw down such a mass  of granite?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He might have asked one of the quarrymen to help  him,&rsquo; asserted Anak savagely, &lsquo;and if I find that man I&rsquo;ll split his skull.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What an amiable individual you are, Mr. Carney,&rsquo;  bantered Forde, and although the man looked dangerous at a tone which he could  not understand he still continued in the same light way. &lsquo;I wonder you didn&rsquo;t  split Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s skull when you saw him hereabout.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I lost him in the mist,&rsquo; said Anak sulkily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was no mist on the day of the murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, there was. Not on the road, perhaps, but  higher up on the moors. It came down suddenly, as mists do in these parts, and  while I was going home I saw Sir Hannibal quite plainly running up from the  place where the murder was done. I followed, as I always hated him, but he got  away, and although I followed him right over the hill to the other road I  couldn&rsquo;t catch him. But I heard the noise of his motor-horn,&rsquo; ended Anak  triumphantly.</p>
  <p>This explanation seemed to prove that the baronet  really was guilty, and yet Anak&rsquo;s tale contradicted that of Polwin&rsquo;s. What if  Polwin had been the man seen by that giant? But that was impossible, as Sir  Hannibal was tall, and Polwin short. One could never be mistaken for the other.  Forde was puzzled, so did not press the question. In place of it he asked  another.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why do you hate Sir Hannibal?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Anak reflected for a moment, then strode forward.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said he, throwing a gloomy look over his  shoulder, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the reason.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Rather perplexed, Forde climbed up the hill with the  big quarryman, and after fifteen minutes&rsquo; hard work reached a small hut built  under the lee of a mighty cromlech. Anak stalked forward and pushed open the  door abruptly. &lsquo;Mother!&rsquo; he called out harshly.</p>
  <p>But no aged woman appeared. The door was filled a  moment later by the graceful form of Miss Anne Stretton.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter  XII<br>
    News</b></h2>
  <p>Anak appeared as much taken aback as Forde at the  unexpected sight of the woman who had foiled the attack on the Dower House. But  for one moment did he look at her beautiful face, then rushed forward with  dilated nostrils and upraised fist.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You let him get away,&rsquo; he growled, remembering the  occasion when she had aided Sir Hannibal to escape.</p>
  <p>Forde caught the giant back, and for his pains Anak  turned on him in mighty wrath. But the young barrister, although by no means  the equal in strength of this Goliath, yet knew something of which Anak was  ignorant: that is, Forde had taken lessons in ju-jitsu. Before Anak, vain of  his muscles, knew what had happened he was lying on his back, tripped up  skilfully in the most unexpected manner. When he sat up again his face of  stupid wonder was something to behold.</p>
  <p>Forde burst out laughing, as did Anne Stretton, and with  a savage growl Anak rose to renew the attack. Swinging his mighty arms, he  lunged forward with all his strength. Forde stood still until the big man was  nearly on top of him then dropped on his back, shot up a foot, and swung Anak,  as on a pivot, over his head to crash amongst the wet herbage. It was all so  lightly and neatly done that Anne, who admired physical dexterity, clapped her  hands.</p>
  <p>Forde laughed, and went towards the prostrate giant.  His head had struck against a stone and he was stunned for the moment. The  barrister cast a casual glance at him, and seeing that he would recover soon,  strolled back to Anne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; he said easily; &lsquo;in ten minutes  he&rsquo;ll be sensible again, Miss Stretton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t killed him, Mr. Forde?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have stunned him; he&rsquo;ll be right again soon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you do something for him?&rsquo; asked Anne,  marvelling at the coolness of this slight young gentleman.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly not. He&rsquo;ll only make trouble when he  recovers his senses, and I wish to talk with you and with Mrs. Carney.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Before Anne could express her sentiments regarding  this calm behaviour &mdash; which, by the way, she secretly admired &mdash; she was pushed  aside and a lean, blear-eyed old crone tottered forth on crutches. She was  dressed in faded rags of once brilliant garments, and her white hair flew in  wisps about her head, unrestrained in any way. A pair of brilliant black eyes  showed that she had all her wits about her, and that her spirit was keen if her  figure was a wreck. Her face was a mass of wrinkles, and she had a true  nutcracker chin. Mrs. Carney certainly would have been burnt in the middle ages  as a witch of the worst.</p>
  <p>Seeing the recumbent form of her big son, she tottered  forward with wrath in her eyes, and looked spitefully at Forde. Could she have  blighted him at that moment she certainly would have done so. And yet in her  regard there was something of fear that so slim a young man should have  overcome such a giant as her son. It was David and Goliath over again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I heard all,&rsquo; said Mrs. Carney, and Forde noted that  she spoke in quite a refined way. &lsquo;What do you mean by killing my son?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have merely stunned him,&rsquo; said Forde airily, &lsquo;and  now he has had a lesson, perhaps he will leave Miss Stretton alone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carney looked up from the head of Anak, which she  had taken on her lap, and glanced at Anne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; she asked shrilly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anak would have struck me,&rsquo; explained Anne, &lsquo;but for  Mr. Forde.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why should he have struck you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I thwarted him when he led the quarrymen to  the Dower House.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a fool,&rsquo; said Mrs. Carney vigorously; &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll  leave you alone when he comes to himself, I&rsquo;ll go bail. Not that I think much  of you, Miss, for having stopped him getting Sir Hannibal and ducking him in  the horse pond.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We discussed all that before,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton  quietly. &lsquo;Mr. Forde, may I ask why you have come here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To have my fortune told.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To have Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s fortune told, you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well yes. I congratulate you on your discernment,  Miss Stretton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you not bring Sir Hannibal with you?&rsquo; she  asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For the very simple reason that he has disappeared.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne started, and an expression of extreme surprise  overspread her dark face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Disappeared! What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Exactly what I say. It seems that the police got out  a warrant to arrest Sir Hannibal in London. Someone gave him warning I suppose,  for when they went to get him he had gone away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very wise of him, Mr. Forde. He will get no justice  while the feeling against him is so strong. Does Miss Trevick know where her  father is, may I ask?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No; she is as perplexed as I am. I came here to  question Anak, as he declares that he saw Sir Hannibal near the spot on the day  of the murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is why I came also,&rsquo; said Anne very frankly. &lsquo;I  wish to help Sir Hannibal out of these difficulties.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, Miss Stretton?&rsquo; asked Forde gravely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that later. As it is growing somewhat  dark and I have to walk back to St. Ewalds perhaps you will accompany me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have a trap waiting near the quarry,&rsquo; said Forde  quickly, &lsquo;and I shall be glad to take you back to St. Ewalds. But I thought  that you were stopping with Mrs. Penrith.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have not been stopping there for some time,&rsquo;  replied Miss Stretton, &lsquo;there has been a quarrel between Mr. Penrith and  myself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I understood that you were engaged to him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. I could have been had I wished, but there are  reasons &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Connected with Sir Hannibal Trevick?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne flung back her head and smiled evasively.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; she said quietly; &lsquo;but see, Mr. Forde, Anak  is coming to his senses.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And small blame to that young gentleman that he is  not dead,&rsquo; said Mrs. Carney in a shrill and angry voice.</p>
  <p>Anak sat up and put his hand to his head in a  bewildered fashion, groaning heavily. He shook his head with both huge hands,  and then rose in a lumpish fashion. He and his withered mother looked like  Caliban and Sycorax, and seemed to be fond of one another in an uncouth way.  What perplexed Forde was that although the pair seemed to be like animals yet  they both spoke such good English &mdash; that is, comparatively, in contrast to the  usual talk of the class they belonged to. He and Anne watched the two in  silence.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All right, mother, all right,&rsquo; said Anak, in a  strangely tender tone as he rose heavily; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s but a bit of a knock. I&rsquo;ll be  my own man soon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come inside, lovey, and let me put some healing herb  to your poor head. I&rsquo;ll make you right and well in a few hours.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wait a bit,&rsquo; said Anak, as his mother hobbled towards  the miserable hut, and then lurched towards his late antagonist.</p>
  <p>Forde, thinking that the giant was about to renew the  attack, held himself in readiness, but it appeared that Anak&rsquo;s intentions were  friendly. He extended a mighty hand with a slow smile.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Put it there, young sir,&rsquo; he grumbled; &lsquo;I never  thought to see the day as anyone could knock me over like a nine-pin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a new way of fighting,&rsquo; laughed Forde, and shook  hands.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A very queer way,&rsquo; said Anak, puzzled. &lsquo;You never put  out your strength in any sort of fashion, and yet over I went. Well, I know  when I&rsquo;m beaten, so let&rsquo;s be friends.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; shrieked Mrs. Carney from the doorway, in  which she appeared with a pot of ointment. &lsquo;Are you going to let that  jackanapes knock you down, Anak, and not have his heart&rsquo;s blood?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You try him, mother,&rsquo; grinned the giant; &lsquo;even your  nails won&rsquo;t reach his handsome face. He&rsquo;s got some trick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lucky for me that I have,&rsquo; said Oswald, good  humouredly; &lsquo;if it was a question of strength I shouldn&rsquo;t give much chance  against you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This compliment to Anak&rsquo;s size rather soothed Mrs.  Carney. She made her gigantic son sit down on a bench near the door, and  applied the ointment to the ragged cut in his head, whence the blood was  oozing. &lsquo;And you two gentlefolk can go away,&rsquo; she grumbled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite ready,&rsquo; said Anne cheerfully. &lsquo;Mr. Forde  will drive me back to St. Ewalds; I&rsquo;ll come and see you again, Mrs. Carney, and  bring some clothes for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wait a bit,&rsquo; interrupted Anak, looking at Forde. &lsquo;I  promised to tell this young gentleman why I hate Sir Hannibal. As him and me is  friends now I&rsquo;ll keep that promise. There you are, sir,&rsquo; he pointed to the old  witch, &lsquo;mother&rsquo;s the cause.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Carney? In what way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman rose herself to explain, and her black  eyes flashed fire.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In what way?&rsquo; she cried savagely, &lsquo;in this way. Sir  Hannibal promised to marry me when I was a gal, and he left me to break my  heart. When I married Carney, who left me, and a bad egg he was &mdash; I brought up  my son to hate Sir Hannibal in the same way as I hate him. Hugh,&rsquo; she pointed  to the giant, &lsquo;hates Trevick as much as I do. He sucked that hatred in with his  mother&rsquo;s milk, and if he can kill him or hang him, so much the better.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But, surely, after all these years you do not bear  malice against Sir Hannibal?&rsquo; cried Anne, appalled by the malignant expression  of the old dame.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I hate him, no more than I did on the day he went  away and left me, to marry Miss Dericka&rsquo;s mother. She was a lady, I was only a  poor and pretty girl. I hate him &mdash; I hate him.&rsquo; She shook a lean fist in the  air, and spat with rage. &lsquo;For years I&rsquo;ve waited for the chance to bring him to  the ground. Now I have the chance; he shall swing for killing John Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In spite of his innocence?&rsquo; asked Forde quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In spite of everything,&rsquo; glared Mrs. Carney. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll  teach gentlemen to break a poor girl&rsquo;s heart. He shall be hanged.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mother!&rsquo; Anak was looking at her intently. &lsquo;From what  you say, I begin to believe that Sir Hannibal is innocent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t. You saw him yourself near the spot.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, so I did,&rsquo; said Anak quickly; &lsquo;but I didn&rsquo;t see  him heave the rock, and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hold your tongue, you great baby,&rsquo; said Mrs. Carney  fiercely; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t dare to say a word in his favour. If you don&rsquo;t hang him, or  kill him, or hurt him in some way, I&rsquo;ll curse you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! no!&rsquo; said the big man, shrinking, and he really  did seem to dread his mother&rsquo;s curse. And no wonder, for her face was a study  fit for one of the Furies as she spoke.</p>
  <p>Forde shrugged his shoulders. He was now certain that  Sir Hannibal was innocent and that Anak was only trying to injure him to  satisfy the vengeance of his mother. At the same time he wanted to be certain  of the truth of Anak&rsquo;s statement that Trevick had been on the moor about the  time of the murder. But there was no chance of getting at the truth while Mrs.  Carney glared at her son, so Forde held out his hand in a friendly fashion.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come and see me at the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Arms&rdquo; one day,&rsquo; he  said good-naturedly; &lsquo;we can then talk. Mrs. Carney&rsquo;&mdash; he threw half a sovereign  to her &mdash;&lsquo;this may be of service.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman uttered a howl of delight and flung  herself grovelling on the gold. Anne, drawing aside her skirts with a gesture  of repulsion, for Mrs. Carney&rsquo;s action was not pretty, passed down the narrow  path along with Forde. The two walked downward in silence, for the path was  somewhat difficult. Not until they reached the level and within sound of the  quarry workings did Anne speak.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am coming to see Miss Trevick,&rsquo; she said calmly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t if I were you,&rsquo; objected Forde, recalling  what Dericka had said of the woman beside him.</p>
  <p>Anne laughed. &lsquo;Oh, I know well what Miss Trevick  thinks of me,&rsquo; said she with a somewhat sad gesture, &lsquo;that I am an adventuress:  that I wish to marry her father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is that not true?&rsquo; enquired the barrister delicately.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not exactly. Sir Hannibal wishes to marry me. He  proposed in a letter, which I have in my pocket.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not at the fete on that day when Dericka and  myself came upon you, Miss Stretton?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was no time, seeing that you interrupted us,&rsquo;  said Anne in a calm manner. &lsquo;Miss Trevick put a stop to Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s  speeches, although a declaration was on his lips. If she had not done so,&rsquo;  added the lady meaningly, &lsquo;Sir Hannibal would never have been in this great  trouble.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you, Miss Stretton,&rsquo; said Forde  stiffly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can explain, but there is no necessity to do so  now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A silence followed, and the two gained the road where  the trap was waiting in charge of the patient driver. Forde walked towards it,  but was detained before he had taken a couple of steps.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Forde,&rsquo; said his companion, &lsquo;I want to talk  freely to you, and cannot do so with that man driving. Wait here and let me  speak.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am quite at your service,&rsquo; said Oswald, somewhat  stiffly and wondering what she was about to say.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know Miss Quinton?&rsquo; said Anne suddenly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. She is now at the Dower House.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed!&rsquo; Anne looked startled. &lsquo;All the more  reason that I should call there. Well, then, Miss Quinton knew my father, and  has known me for many years &mdash; since I was a tiny girl, in fact. It was she who  gave me a letter of introduction to Sir Hannibal and his daughter when I came  to St. Ewalds to study art. Miss Quinton, who is a lady of the old school, for  whom I have profound respect, considers me an adventuress because I act as a  bachelor woman of the present day usually acts. Dericka &mdash; you see I am  familiar, Mr. Forde &mdash; Dericka thinks that I am an adventuress also. Well, that  may be, if an adventuress is one who battles with bad luck, and who wants to  get married to a rich man. You see I am frank, Mr. Forde.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very frank,&rsquo; assented Oswald, puzzled; &lsquo;but why?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am coming to my reason. I want to marry Sir  Hannibal because he is now rich and is easily managed. I do not love him in any  romantic way, but I think I should make him a very good wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that, Miss Stretton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As you know,&rsquo; she pursued quietly, &lsquo;I saved him from  a very unpleasant quarter of an hour by helping him to escape from the  quarrymen. Even although Dericka doesn&rsquo;t like me she must admit that I have  been good to her father in that way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think she admits that, and if you call she will  thank you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In the way in which one woman thanks another that she  hates,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton, with her chin very much in the air. &lsquo;Well, then,  Mr. Forde, I can do much more for Sir Hannibal &mdash; if,&rsquo; she added meaningly, &lsquo;I  hold my tongue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he asked, facing her quickly.</p>
  <p>Anne pointed to the bank overhead a little distance  away, where could be seen the raw earth from which had been wrenched the mass  of granite to stop the motor.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Penrith drove me past that on the day Mr. Bowring  was murdered,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am aware of that. You and he heard the shot and  came back.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so. Well, then, as we drove past the mass of  granite was not on the road but still poised overhead. Mr. Penrith was busy  with his horse, and I looked up. I can&rsquo;t tell you why I should have done so,  but I did look up, and I saw &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, what did you see?&rsquo; asked Forde anxiously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I saw Sir Hannibal Trevick on the top of the stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You must be mistaken,&rsquo; gasped the barrister.</p>
  <p>Anne shook her head. &lsquo;No. Sir Hannibal has a way of  holding himself which cannot be mistaken &mdash; a military erectness. It was  twilight and there was a slight mist drifting down the moor&rsquo;&mdash; here Forde  remembered that Anak had said the same thing &mdash;&lsquo;but I caught a glimpse of Sir  Hannibal on the granite rock quite plainly. I uttered an exclamation of  surprise, and Mr. Penrith asked me what was the matter. I made some vague  excuse, as he was jealous, and I did not want him to see Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, and what did you do?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I made an excuse, as I said, and did not look back.  Then, some distance further on we heard the shot and came back. The rest you  know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And do you think Sir Hannibal killed Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne shrugged her finely moulded shoulders. &lsquo;I have  formed no opinion,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;All I know, you know; what is your conclusion?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde did not give it, but instead asked a leading  question:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Would you marry Sir Hannibal if you had the chance?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have the chance, and when he comes back again I&rsquo;ll  marry him. But if Miss Trevick wants me to let him go I will do so and hold my  tongue for five thousand pounds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Stretton, I don&rsquo;t like to make a bargain like  that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take some time to think over it and tell Dericka what  I say. In the meantime, let us drive back to St. Ewalds. I refuse to say  another word about the matter until you bring me my answer.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And she kept to her determination. As they drove back  to the little town Anne chatted of many things, but did not refer to Sir  Hannibal or his doings all the way. Nor did Forde, for the driver was close to  them, and would have overheard all. In the market place Anne jumped down,  thanked Forde for the drive, and vanished. He ordered the man to drive up to  the Dower House, anxious to tell Dericka what Anne Stretton had said.</p>
  <p>He found Dericka in the sitting-room with Miss Lavinia.  Both of them seemed to be excited over a legal-looking document, and Miss  Trevick rushed at her lover as soon as he entered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oswald,&rsquo; she said, waving a letter, &lsquo;here is a letter  from papa enclosed in one from Mr. Gratton. Papa says that he is not coming  back, and he has made over the sixty thousand pounds income to me by Deed of  Gift. What does that mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter  XIII<br>
    Mrs. Krent&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;A Deed of Gift, and for so large a sum!&rsquo; said Forde,  looking from one excited lady to the other.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, never mind the value,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia  impatiently; &lsquo;to whom should Hannibal give the money if not to his own  daughter? The question is this: What does Hannibal mean by acting in this way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde could make only one reply: &lsquo;It looks like  guilt.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; exclaimed Dericka vehemently. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t  believe that. Papa is weak and easily led, and perhaps his moral principles are  not so strong as they might be. But I decline to think for one moment that he  would commit a murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am of your opinion also, my dear,&rsquo; said Miss  Quinton. &lsquo;Hannibal, painful though it is for me to say, is less of a knave than  a fool.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A fool often makes more mischief than a knave, Miss  Quinton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I agree with you, but the mischief made by this  particular fool has made things very unpleasant for him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oswald! Aunt!&rsquo; cried Dericka, her fair face flushing,  &lsquo;I wish you would stop calling papa names. He is no worse than many another  person. Weakness is not a crime.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It may lead to a crime,&rsquo; snapped Miss Lavinia,  determined to have the last word.</p>
  <p>Dericka allowed her the satisfaction of having it, and  turned to Forde, holding out the letter, which she had retained in her hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I received that with the Deed of Gift from Mr.  Gratton,&rsquo; said she.</p>
  <p>Oswald took the epistle and sat down to read it, while  Miss Quinton, putting on her gold-rimmed spectacles, glanced again through the  deed which made Dericka a wealthy woman.</p>
  <p>First Forde looked at the address to see where Sir  Hannibal might be. But not even to his lawyer or daughter had the baronet given  away the secret of his hiding place. The letter was dated from Gratton&rsquo;s office  in Cheapside, and intimated that Dericka was to make what use she chose of the  sixty thousand a year, as the writer had full confidence in her common sense.  &lsquo;And as with such wealth you will be a fair mark for every knave,&rsquo; wrote Sir  Hannibal, &lsquo;I advise you to marry Oswald Forde as speedily as possible. He is  poor, but at least he is an honest man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s good hearing,&rsquo; Forde remarked to Dericka, who  was reading the epistle over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Papa tells me nothing I did not know before,&rsquo; she  replied, touching his smooth hair gently. &lsquo;Go on. The important part of the  letter has yet to come.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This was true enough, for towards the end of his  communication Sir Hannibal strongly advised Dericka to stop searching for the  assassin of John Bowring. Also, he declared that he was going abroad and had  sufficient money yearly to keep him comfortably. If he wanted more he would  send to Dericka for the same. There was no chance of his coming back, and now  that the trouble of Bowring&rsquo;s death was ended by his retirement, Dericka could  marry Forde and live happily.</p>
  <p>On the whole, as Forde thought when he came to the  signature, the letter hinted that Sir Hannibal was guilty of the crime laid to  his charge.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Dericka again, and guessing what Forde  thought from the expression on his face. Papa is innocent, but he may have gone  away to shield the true assassin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia looked up with an exclamation. &lsquo;Do you  think that my brother-inlaw knows who killed that miserable man?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>Dericka nodded. &lsquo;I can account in no other way for  papa&rsquo;s going into hiding,&rsquo; she said helplessly; &lsquo;there is no reason otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Unless he is guilty,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia, grimly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Aunt, you told me again and again that did not  believe papa would commit a crime.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not one likely to bring him under the shadow of the  gallows, at all events,&rsquo; said the old lady cautiously. &lsquo;I would not say it to  anyone but you, Dericka, or to Mr. Forde here, but that letter,&rsquo; she pointed  with her lorgnette, &lsquo;looks highly suspicious.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I must say that I agree with Miss Quinton,&rsquo; remarked  Forde, &lsquo;and again, what I have learned from Miss Stretton and Anak seems to  prove that Sir Hannibal had something to do with the matter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell me everything you have heard,&rsquo; said Dericka,  growing slightly pale, but in a peremptory manner. In spite of her strong  belief that Sir Hannibal was innocent she was beginning to falter, seeing that  these two near and dear to her were also wavering as to the cleanness of the  baronet&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>Forde wasted no time in preliminaries. He then and  there, in a blunt, brusque way, told what Anak had said, and what Miss Stretton  had repeated.</p>
  <p>Dericka listened with clasped hands, her eyes on his  honest face. She saw no reason to disbelieve what he had said, but tossed her  head irritably when Miss Stretton&rsquo;s name was mentioned.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;An adventuress,&rsquo; said Dericka contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes and no,&rsquo; remarked Oswald quietly. &lsquo;I think you  are too hard upon Miss Stretton, my dear girl. She is no more an adventuress  than many another woman who wants to get settled in life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I quite agree with you, Mr. Forde,&rsquo; cried Miss  Quinton suddenly. &lsquo;I have called Anne an adventuress myself, but, after all,  since the woman&rsquo;s face is her fortune why should she not try to gain an income  from it. Anne comes of good stock, and I knew her parents very well. She is  also clever and handsome, and your father &mdash; who is so weak that he is bound to  marry again &mdash; might do worse than make Anne his wife. At least, she would keep  him out of mischief.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like Miss Stretton,&rsquo; said Dericka  obstinately.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No woman ever does like another,&rsquo; retorted Miss  Quinton, &lsquo;especially when a woman wants to become a second mother.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;d never mother me,&rsquo; flashed out the girl colouring.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is much likelihood,&rsquo; said Miss  Lavinia dryly, &lsquo;seeing that Hannibal is under the ban of the law.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde waited until this war of words was ended, then  addressed himself to Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You cannot deny,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that Miss Stretton  behaved extremely well with regard to saving this house from being wrecked and  getting your father out of the way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She did that to marry him,&rsquo; said Dericka  ungratefully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; retorted the barrister rather coolly, for he  thought Dericka unreasonable. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think Miss Stretton is so very anxious  to marry your father. Even with the chance of getting sixty thousand a year she  is willing, as I told you, to retire from the position of Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s  possible wife on receipt of five thousand pounds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And who will give her that?&rsquo; asked Dericka, fingering  the deed significantly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You will, if you are wise. Miss Stretton&rsquo;s evidence  would certainly damage Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the mere fact that she is trying to blackmail  shows how much she loved papa. It was the money she was after.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think she ever disguised the fact, Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then she&rsquo;s a bad woman,&rsquo; said Miss Trevick decidedly.</p>
  <p>Forde shrugged his shoulders, being quite unequal to  arguing with so prejudiced a young lady.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you think, Miss Quinton?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anne is like the rest of our sex,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia  indifferently, &lsquo;neither wholly black, nor wholly white, but particoloured. At  one time I should have been sorry to see her Hannibal&rsquo;s wife, but now, I can  tell you, Mr. Forde, that he needs a woman with a head on her shoulders to  marry him, so why not Anne?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I manage him,&rsquo; said Dericka sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so, child. But I understand you intend to  manage Mr. Forde.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Quinton chuckled over her joke, and even Dericka  smiled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, after a pause, and making a  concession, &lsquo;perhaps I am hard on Miss Stretton. But so far as I can see from  the present position of my father, she will never marry him, especially when  she knows that I have the money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And her price?&rsquo; asked Forde curiously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see her about that later,&rsquo; said Dericka  shrewdly; &lsquo;the first person to be paid is Mrs. Krent. The news that I am to  marry Morgan is all over the town.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde nodded. &lsquo;I thought that Mrs. Tregar would prove  a good town-crier,&rsquo; he said with satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I want the gossip contradicted at once by Mrs.  Krent,&rsquo; said Miss Trevick imperiously, &lsquo;so I have asked her to come here  to-night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you will pay her one thousand a year, Dericka?&rsquo;  asked the old lady disapprovingly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied the girl with a nod. &lsquo;Mrs. Krent  will not give evidence as to the marriage of Morgan and her daughter other  wise. If that marriage is not proved I may be obliged to marry him, and in any  case there would be trouble.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It seems to me that a thousand in all would be sufficient  for Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; sniffed Miss Quinton.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you, Aunty. After all, Morgan,  insane as he is, is the son, and should be the heir of Mr. Bowring. It will be  a small thing to give him and his wife one thousand out of sixty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not satisfy your conscience and give him the  lot?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered Miss Trevick very decidedly, &lsquo;I am not  so quixotic as all that. My father told me that Mr. Bowring had every right to  leave the money to him for some reason connected with doings in South Africa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shady doings,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps, Aunt; I can&rsquo;t say. At all events I can make  better use of the money in charity and such like things than can Morgan, who is  scarcely responsible for his actions. I will give him and his wife one thousand  a year and the Grange, rent free, to live in. Mrs. Krent can remain there also  to look after the couple, for Mrs. Bowring seems to be almost as weak as her  husband.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What will your father say to all this?&rsquo; asked Forde,  wondering at the prompt and business-like way in which Dericka was dealing with  a very difficult situation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He will say nothing seeing that he is absent, and you  forget, Oswald, that the money is mine now. You may be quite sure that I&rsquo;ll be  just in every way. The first thing to be done is to settle with Mrs. Krent, so  that the marriage of Morgan can be announced and this gossip stopped. Then I&rsquo;ll  see Miss Stretton and make a bargain with her as to holding her tongue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And then, Dericka?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the girl determinedly, &lsquo;you must find out  who killed poor Mr. Bowring. When the real assassin is discovered and my father  can come back, I&rsquo;ll marry you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not before?&rsquo; said Oswald in dismay.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It would not be fair to my father,&rsquo; said Miss Trevick  gravely; &lsquo;I wish him to be at the wedding of his only daughter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence for a few minutes, while Miss  Quinton and Oswald marvelled at the business-like qualities of Dericka. She  looked from one to the other of their puzzled faces with a smile.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I dare say I seem to you to be hard,&rsquo; said she  quietly, &lsquo;but if you can tell me a better way to deal with the situation I am  willing to be guided.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, my dear,&rsquo; said Miss Quinton; &lsquo;you are right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think so, too,&rsquo; said the barrister. Then, taking  Dericka&rsquo;s two hands, he looked quizzically into her flushed face. &lsquo;But, really,  you know, I shall be frightened to marry so clever a woman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dearest,&rsquo; said the girl, kissing him, &lsquo;I am only  clever because the necessity of being clever has been forced upon me. Remember  that from the age of fifteen I have had to do everything for my father, who  would have gone to rack and ruin but for me. When I marry you, Oswald, you can  take the head of the household. I resign in your favour, my dear. I have no  wish to bear the burden longer than I can help. And now,&rsquo; she dropped her hands  and turned away, &lsquo;let us see if Mrs. Krent has arrived.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you want me to be present, Dericka?&rsquo; asked Miss  Quinton, gathering together her work.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not unless you wish to, Aunty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thank you; I have heard quite enough, my child. I&rsquo;ll  leave you and Mr. Forde to entertain the good lady, and I have no doubt that  between you, a bargain will be struck likely to help Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Rest assured, Aunty, that my father will return here  without a stain on his character.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To marry the adventuress.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If he likes,&rsquo; said Dericka, rather unexpectedly. &lsquo;I  fear I am hard on Miss Stretton. Perhaps if I knew her better I should find her  a more amiable character than I think she is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I doubt it, my love,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia grimly, and  going to the door. &lsquo;You and Anne are both business women, and two of a trade  never agree. Both you and Mr. Forde and Hannibal will be woefully henpecked.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When the old lady, with this parting shot, left the  room, Dericka turned to Oswald rather ruefully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;See the character I get for trying to bear the burden  of the Trevick family.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never mind, darling heart,&rsquo; said he caressingly;  &lsquo;when you become my wife you will not need to bear any burden.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t think me unwomanly?&rsquo; faltered Miss Trevick.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear, I think you are the sweetest and cleverest  girl in the world. I don&rsquo;t think a woman need be a helpless log in order to be  what old-fashioned ladies like Miss Quinton call womanly. That early Victorian  simpering damsel is a thing of the past, Dericka. The women of the day are better  fitted to be the comrades of men than their grandmothers were. I would much  rather have you as you are, than a romantic, useless girl, to recline on a sofa  all day reading novels.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It seems to me,&rsquo; said Dericka, scarcely able to keep  from smiling, &lsquo;that our marriage will be something like a partnership.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It will be a comradeship,&rsquo; said Forde quickly, &lsquo;and  as such is more likely to be amicable than if it were founded upon romantic  love. I don&rsquo;t despise love, dearest. All the same, I like a better foundation  than simply passion upon which to base my life and yours. We must mingle prose  and poetry in our married life, my own.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a twentieth century wooing,&rsquo; laughed Dericka,  and rather amused by the view Oswald was taking of the position. She would have  continued the discussion but that Mrs. Krent was announced at the moment.</p>
  <p>Both turned towards the door as the footman closed it,  leaving Mrs. Krent inside, that good lady looking stouter and more comfortable  than ever.</p>
  <p>She still wore her black dress and her gaudy shawl,  her silver ornaments and mauve gloves, presenting an incongruous figure, at  which the young pair could scarcely help smiling. With her red face and  obtrusively yellow hair, upon which a saucy bonnet quite out of keeping with  her years was perched, Mrs. Krent looked what she truly was &mdash; an oddity.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a night!&rsquo; she said gruffly, and dropping without  invitation into a chair; &lsquo;and after such a lovely day, too. As I drove here  from the Grange it came on to rain, and now it&rsquo;s pouring cats and dogs. I  didn&rsquo;t want to leave my warm fireside, I can tell you, young lady.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you should be put to any inconvenience,  Mrs. Krent, but it is necessary for me to see you about Morgan&rsquo;s marriage.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who told you of that?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Krent suddenly, and  stopped fanning herself with a lace handkerchief.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My father did, and Mr. Forde also.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you know about it, sir?&rsquo; asked the  housekeeper.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Merely what Sir Hannibal told me. He has agreed to  your terms.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; snapped Mrs. Krent, &lsquo;seeing that he  swore on the Book.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; continued Forde smoothly, &lsquo;you will have to  deal with me and with Miss Trevick, here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then where is Sir Hannibal?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He has gone abroad for the time being.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ho!&rsquo; snorted the housekeeper; &lsquo;and how do I know but  what you two won&rsquo;t diddle me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be paid the thousand a year, never fear,&rsquo; said  Dericka in a quiet voice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get Mr. Gratton to draw out the deed. In any  case, since Morgan is truly the heir I think that he and his wife should have  the money you ask for them. In fact,&rsquo; added Dericka, after a moment&rsquo;s  reflection, &lsquo;I shall hand over two thousand a year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lord, Miss!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent aghast. &lsquo;What will your  pa say to that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My father has left everything in my hands,&rsquo; said Miss  Trevick, not considering it necessary to speak of the deed of gift; &lsquo;but if I  do this, Mrs. Krent, you must speak plainly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The housekeeper became suspicious. &lsquo;In what way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You must tell me where your daughter was married to  Morgan, and hand me a certificate of the marriage. Also, you must tell me all  you know about Mr. Bowring and my father in Africa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like to hear everything,&rsquo; said Mrs.  Krent, rather disturbed. &lsquo;You seem to be a kind young lady, and I&rsquo;ll do  whatever you ask me to do. I can be easily led,&rsquo; added Mrs. Krent with  emphasis, &lsquo;but if I&rsquo;m forced to be nasty I can make things very unpleasant for  some people.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For Sir Hannibal, for instance?&rsquo; suggested Forde  suavely.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent nodded. &lsquo;There are things in his life which  he would like to be kept quiet. I declare,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent, much after the  style of Lord Clive, who made a similar remark, &lsquo;that I am surprised that I ask  for so little. With what I know I could make Sir Hannibal give me half the  money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then why are you so moderate?&rsquo; asked Dericka  suspiciously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I can&rsquo;t be bothered with a lot of money,  Miss. One thousand or two thousand a year is plenty, and anyone else can have  the rest so far as I am concerned. I&rsquo;ll trust you, Miss,&rsquo; she added suddenly;  &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll know all that I know this very night, and within the hour. I am quite  sure you&rsquo;ll give me the money. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;About Mr. Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; and about your father, and about the Death&rsquo;s  Head.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter  XIV<br>
    An Unexpected Meeting</b></h2>
  <p>Forde had sat down to hear Mrs. Krent&rsquo;s revelations,  but when she mentioned the Death&rsquo;s Head he started to his feet again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear you mention that, Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; said  he vigorously, &lsquo;for I have an idea that the Death&rsquo;s Head has much to do with  the murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What makes you think that?&rsquo; demanded Dericka, while  the housekeeper leaned back and loosened her bonnet-strings with an enigmatic  expression of countenance.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Remember what Miss Warry said, my dear, that Bowring  turned pale and was very surprised when he saw the skull in the tent. Depend  upon it, the thing had some disagreeable memory for him, and such a memory may  have to do with his death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you or agree with you, Oswald.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I may be wrong,&rsquo; answered the barrister, dropping  back into his seat; &lsquo;all the same, that idea is firmly fixed in my head.  However, no doubt Mrs. Krent here will be able to account for Bowring&rsquo;s fears  when he beheld the beastly thing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, unexpectedly. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t explain  why Mr. Bowring feared it, although I know that he did.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you cannot elucidate the mystery?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not of the Death&rsquo;s Head. There is only one person can  do that, as he gave me a hint about it once in Cape Town.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who is the person?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My husband.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And where is he?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, my dear young lady, I am as ignorant as you are  on that point.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But, Mrs. Krent &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t any &ldquo;but&rdquo; about it,&rsquo; rejoined the  housekeeper with asperity, and her hands trembled; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t speak of the man or  I&rsquo;ll lose my temper. If ever there was a scoundrel who walked on two legs he  was Samuel Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Was he a German?&rsquo; asked Forde; &lsquo;the name sounds  German.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he was. He called himself English,  and came, so he said, from New Zealander. But he was a bad man, and left me to  starve. I should have done so but for Bowring,&rsquo; ended Mrs. Krent, and her  listeners noticed that she dropped the prefix to the millionaire&rsquo;s name.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Forde leisurely, &lsquo;scraps of intelligence  of this sort only serve to confuse. Suppose you begin at the beginning, Mrs.  Krent, and tell us exactly what you mean.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dears,&rsquo; said the woman, with a vulgar familiarity,  which neither of the young people liked, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re asking me to tell you my life  history, which would take hours to relate. I&rsquo;ll tell what I can, as briefly as  possible. I&rsquo;ve had a hard time, a very hard time,&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Krent, looking  at her hands in the mauve gloves &mdash; admiringly, perhaps; &lsquo;trouble is second  nature with me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your troubles will be over when you get the two  thousand a year, Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; observed Dericka, comforting the woman.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, my dear, money ain&rsquo;t everything. Just when I&rsquo;m  settled down that husband of mine will turn up to make trouble. He always did,  he always will. I&rsquo;ve got a temper myself, and can hold my own with most people,  but not with Samuel. No! no!&rsquo; Mrs. Krent shook her head with a weak smile. &lsquo;Old  Nick is Samuel&rsquo;s father, and Samuel may be with him for all I know; I hope he  is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said Forde, rather impatient and anxious to  get to the truth so far as it concerned Bowring; &lsquo;begin at the beginning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Krent, again shaking her head, &lsquo;that  takes me back many, many years. I was born in Whitechapel, and got good  schooling when I was a gal, for my people were plumbers and well-to-do. I was a  fine buxom gal, my dears, and when I went into service I had many an offer of  marriage. I took Jerry Ward, who worked as a shoemaker. Him and me went to  Africa, and there he died, poor soul, just three years after my Jenny was  born.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Dericka, rather surprised; &lsquo;I thought your  daughter was Jenny Krent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jenny Ward is her real name, my dear, called after  her first father, though to prevent muddle I did allow her to say she was  Krent, that being the name of my second. But she&rsquo;s neither Krent nor Ward now,  my dears, but Mrs. Jane Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can prove the marriage?&rsquo; asked Forde quickly.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent drew herself up with an offended air. &lsquo;I  can show you the certificate,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Jenny&rsquo;s a good girl, and I&rsquo;m a  respectable woman. But that can come later. I want to tell all carefully, my  dears, so that you may understand.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes. Go on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent settled herself comfortably and continued,  pleased, as a chattering person always is, to find herself the centre of  attraction, and with attentive listeners.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ward died, as I said,&rsquo; she resumed, &lsquo;leaving me a  lone widow woman with Jenny, quite a baby. I went out washing in Cape Town, for  there we lived. Ward emigrated to better himself, but, Lord bless you, he was  took off with consumption in a jiffy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And what did you do?&rsquo; asked Dericka, anxious to bring  Mrs. Krent back to the point.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I took in washing, my dears, as I said. Them niggers  washed, too, but none of them could starch shirts like me, so I did well with  the laundry. That was over twenty years ago,&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Krent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was a baby then,&rsquo; murmured Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss, and so was Jenny. Then I saw your pa. He  was always fond of clean linen, and came to my laundry. More than that, he was  so pleased with my washing that he brought along Bowring and Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Were those three together?&rsquo; asked the barrister  suddenly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In partnership, as you might say, Mr. Forde; they did  business over diamonds and gold and anything by which they could turn an honest  penny. Sir Hannibal, who was friendly with me for so fine a gentleman, talked  quite freely, and said that he had come out to make a fortune. How he fell in  with Bowring, I can&rsquo;t say, but he did, up at Kimberley, I think, and Bowring,  being clever without money, and Sir Hannibal having money, without being clever  &mdash; asking your pardon, my dear &mdash; the two thought they&rsquo;d join forces and make a  fortune.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And Krent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He was a kind of sleeping partner,&rsquo; said the  housekeeper; &lsquo;he did the dirty work.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then there was dirty work?&rsquo; demanded Forde,  significantly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Plenty of it. Sir Hannibal, again asking your pardon,  my dear, was a fine gentleman, but not clever. Bowring was too much for him,  and for Krent, too. It was Bowring who made the money, and a blackguard he was,  shame that I should say so, my dears, seeing he has been so good to me, and is  dead, not to speak of the fact that he&rsquo;s my brother-inlaw.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your brother-inlaw?&rsquo; cried the listeners,  simultaneously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;By marriage,&rsquo; explained Mrs. Krent, &lsquo;else I shouldn&rsquo;t  have let my Jenny marry Morgan. Bowring married Ward&rsquo;s sister, and as he was my  first husband that makes &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Forde, cutting her short. &lsquo;We  understand the relationship, Mrs. Krent. Go on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, as I say,&rsquo; pursued the housekeeper,  &lsquo;Bowring married Amelia Ward shortly after my first husband&rsquo;s death. She was  not quite right in her head, poor thing, and they say that Bowring treated her  cruelly. She died five years later, leaving Morgan, and as Bowring couldn&rsquo;t be  bothered with the boy, and I was a relative, he left him to me to bring up.  Then he and Sir Hannibal went to the Transvaal, after diamonds, I suppose.  Krent waited behind, and you could have knocked me down with a feather,&rsquo; said  Mrs. Krent, lifting her hands, &lsquo;when he asked me to marry him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You did?&rsquo; queried Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear, Krent told me a story of his future wealth,  and as I was tired of washing I took him. He had pretty ways, too,&rsquo; added Mrs.  Krent, thoughtfully, &lsquo;but, Lord bless you, that was only at the beginning of  the marriage. Afterwards he became a brute, and took all my money and went to  the Transvaal after Sir Hannibal and Bowring, leaving me with next to nothing,  keeping Jenny and Morgan, who were both well grown by then.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When did you see him again?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not for years and years. One night he appeared in the  rain, just such a night as this, my dears. He was at the door, and when I saw  his face in the light of a lamp I gave a shriek &mdash; it was so white and  horrid-looking. He came in and said that he wanted money and a bed. Bowring had  kicked him out of the firm and was making money fast.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why was Krent kicked out?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The housekeeper lowered her voice and cast a  frightened look round the room. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell everyone,&rsquo; she said, softly,  &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ve promised to make a clean breast of it to that young lady. Krent told  me that Bowring had forged Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s name to some bills, and these Sir Hannibal  kept hanging over Bowring&rsquo;s head.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is not true,&rsquo; said Dericka, indignantly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; insisted Mrs. Krent. &lsquo;Bowring admitted as  much to me when he came back and took me to England after making his fortune.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But my father would never &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hush! Dericka,&rsquo; said Forde, quickly; &lsquo;let Mrs. Krent  tell the story in her own way. I believe we are coming to something important.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka subsided and bit her lip, although she was  annoyed that a common woman such as Mrs. Krent was should accuse Sir Hannibal  Trevick of such conduct.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent saw her annoyance, and became flurried.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear young lady, I shouldn&rsquo;t say what I have said  unless it was true,&rsquo; she protested. &lsquo;Krent found out about these forged bills  and &mdash; to be plain, my dears &mdash; he tried to blackmail Bowring, who was then rich.  But Bowring took him to Sir Hannibal, who denied that there was any forgery, so  Krent could do nothing. Bowring then kicked him out of the firm, and he came to  me without a penny.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Serve him right, too,&rsquo; said Forde indignantly; &lsquo;he  was a scamp.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He was worse than that,&rsquo; sighed the housekeeper. &lsquo;No  one knows what I had to put up with. He kicked me and struck me, and spent my  money on other women, begging your pardon, my dear, and lived on me, till I was  fairly driven wild. He was always writing to Bowring and Sir Hannibal, but they  would not help him. Then he went away, and remained absent for a year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where did he go?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To the Transvaal. I fancy something was wrong which  Krent could not put right, something about diamonds. He came back in a year  with plenty of money and a tale of the Death&rsquo;s Head.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Forde with satisfaction; &lsquo;and what is the  tale?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear young gentleman, I know no more than you do  as Krent never would tell me. All he said was that Bowring had been warned once  by the nigger skull, and had escaped death. If he was warned again he might  escape; but the third time of warning was fatal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde reflected, his eyes on the woman&rsquo;s broad,  common-looking face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did Krent possess the skull?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she whispered; &lsquo;he &mdash; Krent, I mean &mdash; said that  Sir Hannibal had it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka and Forde looked suddenly at one another,  wondering if Sir Hannibal had placed the skull in the fortune-teller&rsquo;s tent on  that fatal day.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand quite,&rsquo; said Oswald, after a  pause, &lsquo;but it seems that this skull &mdash; a nigger&rsquo;s skull, you say? &mdash; was a kind  of warning to Bowring that he would be killed if he saw it three times.&rsquo; Then  when Mrs. Krent nodded he went on: &lsquo;Bowring saw it for the first time in the  Transvaal, according to Krent, and &mdash; I suppose, the second time here &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No; begging your pardon, sir. Bowring came down to  Cape Town, and was about with many people over diamond mines. He sometimes came  to see Morgan, who was with me. One day he came in quite white, and Krent gave  him brandy. Then Krent afterwards told me that Bowring had seen the skull for  the second time, and that the third time meant death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the third time was in the grounds of this house,&rsquo;  said Forde, meditatively, &lsquo;and it DID mean death. But explain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent threw up her hands. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t explain, sir.  That was all Krent told me. Then Bowring paid him to go away, and he went. I  have not set eyes on him for ten years, and glad I am that he is away. Then Sir  Hannibal came back to England; afterwards Bowring came and took me and Jenny  and Morgan. He said that he wanted to be near Sir Hannibal&rsquo;&mdash; Mrs. Krent sunk  her voice again, and again glanced round &mdash;&lsquo;and so took the Grange and made me  housekeeper. But I think that Sir Hannibal made him stop there so as to keep an  eye on him over those bills. I have no reason to say so,&rsquo; added the woman,  wiping her red face, &lsquo;but those are my thoughts, my dears.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the marriage?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, my dears, Bowring was close-fisted, and often  lost his temper with me and Jenny. He once or twice said that he would turn us  out to starve, so, to get the better of him, I made Jenny marry Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That was not right,&rsquo; said Dericka, indignantly,  &lsquo;seeing what Morgan is &mdash; quite insane.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, he is not so very insane, and Jenny is quite fond  of him,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent easily. &lsquo;If he was insane &mdash; very bad, that is &mdash; the  clergyman would not have married him to Jenny. She and me can manage him; but  no one else,&rsquo; added Mrs. Krent, &lsquo;least of all his father, who always put him in  a rage.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where did the marriage take place?&rsquo; asked Mr. Forde,  brusquely.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent produced a certificate of marriage from her  capacious pocket.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In London, at St. Edwin&rsquo;s Church,&rsquo; she said, handing  this to the barrister; &lsquo;everything is in order. It&rsquo;s about a year ago, now. I intended  to tell Bowring when he tried on any of his games about turning me and Jenny  out. And now that is all,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, rising to go. &lsquo;And if you like,  sir, I&rsquo;ll tell everyone that Jenny is Mrs. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think it will be as well, Mrs, Krent,&rsquo; said Forde,  glancing through the certificate, which appeared to be quite in order. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll  keep this to verify it at the church.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll find it all right, sir,&rsquo; said the  housekeeper, tossing her head; &lsquo;is there anything else, my dears?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Dericka, rising; &lsquo;why did you accuse my  father of having killed Mr. Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, you see, Miss,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, colouring even  redder than she already was, &lsquo;I heard by a side wind about the Death&rsquo;s Head in  the tent, and knowing from my husband that Sir Hannibal had it, I thought that  he had put it there to frighten Bowring, and afterwards had killed him. I knew,  too, that Sir Hannibal wanted money, and fancied that he had tried to get the  fortune in that way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Kent,&rsquo; said Forde gravely and slipping the  certificate into his pocket, &lsquo;there was no need for Sir Hannibal to kill  Bowring in order to get the money. With the bills you speak of in his  possession he could easily have extorted what he wanted from Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Oswald, do you accuse my father of blackmail?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, my dear, but if Mrs. Krent thinks him guilty of  murder she can easily guess he would not hesitate at blackmail, and so would  prefer the lesser crime to the greater.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say Sir Hannibal killed Mr. Bowring,&rsquo; said  Mrs. Krent, wagging her hands helplessly, &lsquo;but it does look odd about this  skull.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very odd,&rsquo; assented Forde quietly, and escorting her  to the door; &lsquo;it will be as well, Mrs. Krent, to say nothing of this  conversation until such time as I give you leave.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not say a word,&rsquo; she replied firmly; &lsquo;all I want  is the money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You shall have it as soon as Mr. Gratton can draw up  a deed,&rsquo; said Dericka. &lsquo;Meanwhile, tell everyone that Morgan is married.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This Mrs. Krent promised to do, and departed rather  relieved in her mind that her troubles, so far as money was concerned, were now  at an end. She went out into the dark rainy night and climbed, groaning, into a  trap which had brought her from the Grange. With a parting wave of her pudgy  hand to Forde she went off.</p>
  <p>All the time of that drive Mrs. Krent was thinking of  her missing husband, and shuddering at the possibility that he might reappear  in her life now, when everything was settled comfortably.</p>
  <p>It was pitch dark, and only the lights of the trap  cast a forward glare as the moors stretched out their arms to embrace and  swallow up the vehicle. Not a star was to be seen, and the rain drove  continuously in the faces of the driver and his companion. The housekeeper  muffled her ample form up well against the raw air, and thought of the past. It  was extremely disagreeable that it should concern itself almost exclusively  with the hateful face of Samuel Krent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been talking about him,&rsquo;  thought Mrs. Krent as the trap drew near the Grange. &lsquo;Ugh! I&rsquo;ll never mention  him again, now that I&rsquo;ve told what I&rsquo;ve been forced to tell.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When the twinkling lights of home shone in her eyes  Mrs. Krent became more cheerful, and the bugbear ghost of Krent vanished from  her mind. At the sound of the approaching wheels Jenny opened the big hall  door, and Mrs. Krent climbed groaning down, for her limbs ached with exertion  and dampness. But she had help at hand. A man came forward to assist her.  Without thinking, she took his hand and descended slowly, breathing heavily.  The trap drove round to the stable. But while it was moving off Mrs. Krent  caught sight of the man&rsquo;s face in the light of the lamps, just as she had seen  it years ago in lamplight in Cape Town.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Samuel Krent! Samuel Krent!&rsquo; she cried, and waddled  up the steps as hard as she could, terrified out of her life.</p>
  <p>But the man, who followed her closely, bore an  uncommon resemblance to Josiah Polwin.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter  XV<br>
    Husband and Wife</b></h2>
  <p>Mrs. Krent swarmed up the steps with an agility  surprising in so stout a woman. Tearing the heavy door from her daughter&rsquo;s  grasp, she flung it to and dropped in an untidy heap on to the pavement.</p>
  <p>The door, however, simply swung against the foot of  the man, who was determined to enter, and a moment afterwards he was standing  over the frightened housekeeper, by this time dissolved in tears.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This is a nice welcome, upon my word!&rsquo; said Krent,  alias Polwin, and in a bullying tone, quite different to his meekness in the  presence of Forde. &lsquo;Get up, Maria, and don&rsquo;t make a fool of yourself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; asked Jenny, coming to the aid of her  mother.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m your father, Samuel Krent,&rsquo; retorted the man.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, liar &mdash; liar, seeing Jenny&rsquo;s name is Ward,&rsquo; moaned  Mrs. Krent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I understood that her name was Bowring,&rsquo; said the  returned wanderer cheerfully. &lsquo;Get up, Maria; I have much to say.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I shall sit here for ever,&rsquo; gasped Mrs. Krent, and  placed one fat hand on her aching side.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; said Jenny, striving to screw her  small pale pretty face into a severe look, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call the men and have you  thrown out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A nice way to treat your father, my girl.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are not my father, and I am not your girl,&rsquo; was  Jenny&rsquo;s remarkable spirited reply; &lsquo;address me with all respect as Mrs.  Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh Mrs. Bowring,&rsquo; he bowed ironically, &lsquo;I ask you  pardon. Will you be so pleased as to ask my wife to rise and conduct herself  less like a fool.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Morgan,&rsquo; cried Jenny, while Mrs. Krent still wept  bitterly on the cold black and white pavement.</p>
  <p>A thin whimper, like a kicked dog, answered her, and  from a side room appeared Morgan, creeping along the wall, with a hanging head  and hunched shoulders. His face was white, and his lips redder than ever, and  he looked exactly like a vampire as depicted in Hungarian legends.</p>
  <p>With strange, lifeless eyes he gazed at his pretty  wife and then at Mrs. Krent grovelling on the stone floor.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A nice son to inherit John Bowring&rsquo;s money,&rsquo; laughed  Polwin jeeringly.</p>
  <p>Morgan&rsquo;s eyes settled on the lean, sneering face of  the little man, and a look of recognition crept into them.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin,&rsquo; he said in his thin, high voice, which was  like that of a child. &lsquo;I saw you in St. Ewalds. Yes; I remember. Jenny left me  in the trap while she was shopping and you spoke to me. You told me to say  nothing of having seen you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin,&rsquo; echoed Mrs. Krent, struggling to rise and  getting on her knees. &lsquo;Eb, that name &mdash; Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s steward?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; said Polwin. &lsquo;I have been acting as his  steward for quite sixteen months.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To think that you should have been so near and I  never knew,&rsquo; wailed Mrs. Krent. &lsquo;I would have put the ocean between us had I  known.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want you,&rsquo; said Polwin insolently; &lsquo;all I  wish for is a conversation, and then I&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Swear to leave the house this very night and I&rsquo;ll  talk to you,&rsquo; said his wife, getting on to her feet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I promise without swearing,&rsquo; said Polwin in a  sanctimonious tone. &lsquo;Be calm, Maria, I am not what I was. As Samuel Krent I was  lost, as Josiah Polwin I am found; I preach at the Gwynne Chapel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Lord, the devil quoting Scripture!&rsquo; muttered Mrs.  Krent; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all right, Jenny,&rsquo; she added, seeing the look of fear on her  daughter&rsquo;s face; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d better talk to him lest worse befall.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A nice greeting,&rsquo; snarled Polwin, &lsquo;when I&rsquo;ve come to  do you a good turn, you ungrateful woman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo; Mrs. Krent laughed. &lsquo;You never did man, woman  or child a good turn in all your wicked days, Samuel Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Josiah Polwin, if you please,&rsquo; he snapped, &lsquo;that  being my real name.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; sighed the housekeeper; &lsquo;you didn&rsquo;t even marry  me straight. I am glad Jenny is not your child.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; said Polwin, contemptuously. &lsquo;A whey-faced  minx.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Morgan made an angry noise in his throat. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my  little girl,&rsquo; he gurgled, clasping and unclasping his hands; &lsquo;leave her alone  or I&rsquo;ll tear the heart out of you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin stepped back a step, as the look in the man&rsquo;s  eyes was not pleasant. Jenny laughed triumphantly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You see, I am protected, Mr. Polwin, or Krent, or  whatever you like to call yourself,&rsquo; and took her husband&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am not afraid of your husband,&rsquo; said Polwin, with  his eyes on the white, vacant face of the idiot; &lsquo;you know me, Morgan?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; I saw you in St. Ewalds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And?&rsquo; said Polwin, fixing him with anything but a  meek look.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; echoed Morgan, drooping lower and lower as  though a burden was being piled on his shoulders; &lsquo;and &mdash; oh!&rsquo;&mdash; he flung out his  hands and covered his eyes &mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t look. I&rsquo;ll be good &mdash; I&rsquo;ll be good. Jenny,&rsquo;  he tugged at his wife&rsquo;s dress, &lsquo;come away. He&rsquo;s the big, red devil. He&rsquo;s a  witch-doctor, same as I saw in Africa. Oh, the scarlet skull &mdash; oh, the fire and  &mdash; no &mdash; no!&rsquo; As Polwin still kept looking at him he dropped on all fours like a  beast, and crept swiftly up the stairs, moaning all the time, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be good &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll be good.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When his wailing died away Mrs. Krent, whose face was  as white as paper, faced her small husband boldly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What does this devilry mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never you mind, Maria,&rsquo; he replied quietly. &lsquo;Morgan  saw something in Cape Town that wasn&rsquo;t pleasant.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Death&rsquo;s Head?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never you mind,&rsquo; said Polwin again, then suddenly  became irritable. &lsquo;Here, take me in and give me wine and food. I&rsquo;m tired of  talking in damp clothes, and hungry. Jenny,&rsquo; he turned sharply on the girl,  &lsquo;go!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Bowring stood her ground, although her face was  also white, and she trembled from head to foot. The effect of Polwin&rsquo;s gaze on  the usually intractable Morgan had frightened her not a little. &lsquo;I stand by my  mother,&rsquo; she faltered.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent moved forward and patted her hand. &lsquo;Go,  deary,&rsquo; she whispered, wetting her dry lips with her tongue. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d best speak  him fair.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;See here,&rsquo; said Polwin with a stamp, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re making a  fuss about nothing; I&rsquo;ve come to give you money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want it,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent; &lsquo;me and Jenny have  two thousand a year. Yes, you may look and look, but Miss Trevick has given us  &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where did Miss Trevick get the money?&rsquo; asked Polwin,  and his pale eyes became two pinholes as they narrowed dangerously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;From her father, I suppose. Sir Hannibal got  Bowring&rsquo;s fortune.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, but Sir Hannibal wouldn&rsquo;t &mdash;&rsquo; He stopped and  gnawed his fingers with a thoughtful look. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s more in this man than I  know of,&rsquo; he said suspiciously; &lsquo;come away, Maria and tell me everything. If  you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll stay with you for the rest of my blessed life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Lord! oh, Lord!&rsquo; cried the terrified woman; &lsquo;not  that, Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin, you fool. I don&rsquo;t choose to be known as Krent  here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin, then.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Polwin. Be respectful.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Polwin,&rsquo; whimpered Mrs. Krent, terrified to death  by the devilish look which the little man cast upon her. &lsquo;Jenny, love, go to  Morgan and keep him quiet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wish Morgan would kill you,&rsquo; cried Jenny, mounting  the stairs and facing Polwin for one moment.</p>
  <p>He laughed in a nasty, sneering way.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I dare say you do, but I&rsquo;m not so easy got rid of. If  Morgan isn&rsquo;t quiet tell him that the black man with the crowned skull will come  to him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jenny wondered what this threat might mean, but giving  no answer disappeared round the landing on her way to the idiot. Mrs. Krent  sighed heavily, pushed open the door of the sitting-room and walked in,  followed by her undesirable husband. With a dragging step the poor woman went  to the fire at the end of the room and put one foot on the high fender to dry  her boots. Polwin snarled, and darting forward he twisted her arm until she  shrieked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Get food,&rsquo; said he, grinning at the pain of her  expression; &lsquo;do you think I&rsquo;m here to wait on you? Have you any servants?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Three,&rsquo; whimpered Mrs. Krent, standing before him  like an elephant before a cock sparrow.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where are they?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In bed by this time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then let them stay there. I don&rsquo;t want it known that  I am here. As Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s steward I have to keep my good name. Go and get me  some food and drink, and hold your tongue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, Samuel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin, I tell you; Mr. Polwin to a slut like you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The big woman hurried away as quickly as her tottering  legs would allow her. Polwin gazed after her with a smile of satisfaction, and  then seated himself in an armchair which was comfortably near the glowing fire.  Here he removed his boots, held his small feet to the blaze, and producing a  cigar, lighted it carefully, and with the air of a man who knew what a good  weed was. When the fragrant smoke of it was curling round his lank grey hair &mdash;  such of it as remained &mdash; he cast a lordly look round the splendidly furnished  room. Bowring had spared no expense in putting the Grange in order, and the  result was that the furniture and hangings and decorations were of the best.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mine,&rsquo; said Mr. Polwin with a gratified air. &lsquo;Mine,&rsquo;  he repeated, and licked his thin lips. &lsquo;What a comfort it is to come home.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The sentiment was not shared by Mrs. Krent, who  entered hurriedly and placed on the table a tray covered with a white cloth. On  it was a plate of dainty slices of ham, a crusty loaf, a pat of butter, a pot  of pate de fois gras, and a bottle of excellent port. Polwin, who was delicate  in his appetite, as she knew of old, cast a pleased look at the repast.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Place it on a small table and bring it here!&rsquo; he  commanded abruptly, laying aside his cigar for the moment.</p>
  <p>The obedient Mrs. Krent brought a small table close to  his elbow and arranged the tray. He made her pour him out a glass of port, and  then pointed to a near chair, rather an uncomfortable one. &lsquo;Sit there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Samuel &mdash; I mean, Mr. Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And hold your tongue till I give you leave to speak!&rsquo;  commanded the little demon.</p>
  <p>The housekeeper obeyed, keeping her anxious eyes  fastened on the wrinkled yellow face that looked as malicious as that of the  Yellow Dwarf. Mrs. Krent was as little like the vulgar virago who had defied  Sir Hannibal as Polwin was like the meek steward who had cringed in the  presence of Oswald Forde.</p>
  <p>Polwin ate and drank leisurely, keeping his wife  waiting fifteen minutes in silence while he finished his meal. Then he poured  himself out another glass of port and relighted his cigar. It was noticeable  that he did not offer Mrs. Krent any wine, although the poor woman needed some  to sustain her. When the cigar was in full blast Polwin turned a smiling,  satisfied face on his stout better half, or, rather, worse half, seeing that he  was completely her master. For some minutes he eyed her with a grin, and Mrs.  Krent&rsquo;s hand worked restlessly. She longed to slap his face, but under the  compelling power of those pale eyes she did not dare. Like a meek little  school-girl, she quailed before the small man, whom she could have crushed with  one hand. And, oh, how she longed to crush him!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I came to St. Ewalds over a year ago,&rsquo; said Polwin  suddenly, &lsquo;because the money which Trevick gave me to go to New Zealand was  spent. As I knew much that was unpleasant, Trevick, at my desire, made me his  steward.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Lord!&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Krent; &lsquo;and I never knew.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I took good care that you shouldn&rsquo;t know by never  coming here. When you visited the Dower House I kept out of your sight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t Bowring recognise you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Maria. I kept out of his sight also, until such  time as I required him. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the way in which he treated me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You beast,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent with sudden fury; &lsquo;I  believe that you killed him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; Polwin waved aside a wreath of smoke airily.  &lsquo;I would have killed him in a much more artistic fashion. What I have come to  ask you is, why did Trevick kill Bowring when he had him under his thumb? Tell  me, Maria.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent stared. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know if Sir  Hannibal killed him at all,&rsquo; she said piteously.</p>
  <p>Polwin looked puzzled. &lsquo;But you accused him when the  will was read.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know, because of that skull in the tent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you have no true evidence?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. I was angry that Bowring had left the money to  Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin for the first time looked disconcerted.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought you knew something,&rsquo; he said in an acid  tone; &lsquo;you always were a fool, Maria.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be expected to know about the death,&rsquo; she  replied sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk like that, Maria, to me, or I&rsquo;ll show  you a new trick I have learned, to make you suffer,&rsquo; grinned her spouse. &lsquo;Come,  now,&rsquo; he added, when she quailed, &lsquo;do you know if Sir Hannibal killed &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t. I believe you killed Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did not. He was more of value to me alive than  dead. Those bills &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You could do nothing with those, seeing Sir Hannibal  swore that they were not forgeries.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hold you tongue and listen,&rsquo; snapped the little man.  &lsquo;I say that those bills placed Bowring under Trevick&rsquo;s thumb, so I don&rsquo;t see  why Trevick should kill him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he did,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s because Miss Trevick has paid you two  thousand a year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, yes. Jenny and me and Morgan are well off now.  And if you think to get any of the money you won&rsquo;t, Samuel,&rsquo; she added  desperately; &lsquo;I shall have a divorce.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Before she could withdraw her hand Polwin had seized  it, and was screwing his knuckles into the back. Mrs. Krent writhed with pain  and finally shrieked, while Polwin went on screwing and smiling.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you sorry, Maria?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; gasped the poor creature, and when he let  her go she nursed her sore hand in her bosom, rocking with pain. Polwin still  smiled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a new trick, Maria,&rsquo; said the little demon,  grinning. &lsquo;Now listen to me and don&rsquo;t interrupt or you&rsquo;ll have worse pain to  suffer. I met Trevick on his motor-bicycle going after Miss Stretton and Mr.  Penrith. He wanted to give the lady a letter. I was on the road behind the hill  and met Trevick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did he go by that road?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Krent, still  rocking. &lsquo;Miss Stretton and Mr. Penrith, as I heard at the inquest, came by the  direct road leading to this place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Trevick made a mistake. At all events he asked me to  take the letter on and gave me the bicycle. I delivered it at Penrith&rsquo;s place  and left Trevick on the other road behind the hill. Now,&rsquo; added Polwin, placing  one finger in the palm of his hand, &lsquo;Trevick could easily have climbed over the  hill to loosen that stone, and he had plenty of time to do so before Bowring&rsquo;s  motor-car came along. I know for a fact that he was not in the house when I  returned, for I came back by the second road, and did not appear until dinner.  Plenty of time, Maria, for him to have walked back.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you really think that Sir Hannibal killed  Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do, Maria, but I want to know why he killed him,  seeing that he could do what he liked about the money, thanks to those bills.  Of course,&rsquo; added Polwin thoughtfully, &lsquo;there is the Death&rsquo;s Head.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent stopped rocking. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t understand that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Maria, you&rsquo;re too much of a fool to understand  anything. I am going to explain, as I want you to get me ten thousand a year  from Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get it yourself?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where Sir Hannibal is hiding, or I  would.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t find him, Samuel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Polwin, Maria, unless you want another screw. I  am aware that you can&rsquo;t find him, but I dare say Miss Trevick can. You went to  see her to-night, and you tell me that she is friendly enough to give you two  thousand a year. You told me so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, but how did you know that I was at the Dower  House?&rsquo; &lsquo;You told me so,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Polwin agreeably, &lsquo;and also I saw you  there, Maria. For that reason I followed you here to find out your little game,  my dear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; gasped Mrs. Krent, looking at the man  with fear; &lsquo;I drove!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So did I, Maria.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I heard no wheels.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You heard the wheels of your own trap. I was hanging  on behind, and a very unpleasant journey I had.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent gasped, and stared with her eyes as round  as gooseberries and bulging with fear. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she gasped; &lsquo;what a devil you  are.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin took this quite as a compliment.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am rather fly,&rsquo; he said modestly; &lsquo;you take care,  Maria, or I&rsquo;ll be one too many for you as I am now, my darling. Thwart me, and  I&rsquo;ll screw not your hand but your neck. Obey me, and with ten thousand a year,  mind you, I pass out of your life for ever, sweetheart.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d give double the money to see the last of you,&rsquo;  whimpered Mrs. Krent, drawing back, for his mean, yellow face was unpleasantly  near her now plump red one, &lsquo;what do you want me to do?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Various things. First, to make matters clear, I&rsquo;ll  tell you the story of the Death&rsquo;s Head. I think that will supply the motive for  the murder of Bowring by Trevick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You told me of the three warnings.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In Africa, but I did not explain fully. The fact is,  I was not quite sure at the time of the true story. But I learned it, and came  back to tell it to Trevick &mdash; with the Death&rsquo;s Head,&rsquo; ended Polwin, slowly and  pointedly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter  XVI<br>
    The Letter</b></h2>
  <p>Mrs. Krent placed her fat hands on her fat knees and  stared at her wicked little husband. That gentleman lighted a fresh cigar and  lounged back in his chair sipping a glass of port with an appreciative air.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, Maria?&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You &mdash; you had the Death&rsquo;s Head?&rsquo; she stammered; &lsquo;you  &mdash; you placed it in the tent at the fete?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so, Maria, and took it away again. I placed it  there on the chance &mdash; we must always allow for chance &mdash; that Bowring would have  his fortune told. He did, and saw it, so he must have known that the end was  not far off.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Samuel, do you mean to say that Miss Warry knows who  killed &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I believe she does,&rsquo; interrupted the steward quietly,  &lsquo;and on that knowledge based her prophecy, which every fool believed. As to the  Death&rsquo;s Head, I&rsquo;ll tell you why it frightened Bowring. He was a superstitious  ass.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, who looked frightened herself,  and cast a shivering glance round the comfortable room, &lsquo;Bowring didn&rsquo;t believe  in ghosts.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He believed in other things, such as sudden death at  the hands of an enemy &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not in this instance &mdash; a Zulu witch-doctor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Morgan said &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He mentioned a witch-doctor tonight in his  mumblings,&rsquo; finished Polwin pleasantly, &lsquo;so I remember. The witch-doctor saw  him in the Transvaal, that time Bowring took the boy with him. Morgan has not  been the same since, as he got his life frightened out of him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a shame &mdash; the poor, mad boy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not mad enough to prevent him marrying your  daughter,&rsquo; chuckled Polwin. &lsquo;But, enough! Maria, you are prolix, and the night  is getting towards morning, also the wine is finished and the fire is going  out. Listen, and hold your tongue about what I&rsquo;m telling you until such time as  I give you leave to speak.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent glanced at the clock, which pointed to  twelve, and nodded in an anxious manner. Polwin tipped off the ash of his cigar  with his little finger and began a rather gruesome story.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In the Transvaal,&rsquo; said he &mdash;&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t for obvious  reasons mention the exact place &mdash; Sir Hannibal had the misfortune to murder a  Zulu.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; gasped Mrs. Krent, pushing  back her chair.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Maria, I&rsquo;ll screw your hand again,&rsquo; said Polwin with  displeasure, then, when she hastily hid her sore hand again in her bosom, he  went on calmly: &lsquo;This Zulu had a diamond, which Sir Hannibal, and I may say,  Bowring, wanted. He refused to part with it, and while chaffering in the wilds,  beyond sight of the Transvaal police &mdash; you understand, Maria &mdash; Sir Hannibal  shot him and took the diamond.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, keeping a wary eye on her  husband in case he should torture her again, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that Sir Hannibal  is a thief and a murderer.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is a thief, because he stole the Zulu&rsquo;s diamond,&rsquo;  said Polwin calmly, &lsquo;and doubly a murderer since he killed the Zulu and  Bowring. No one knew the truth save Bowring, and Sir Hannibal feared him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, and you say that Sir Hannibal killed Bowring for  that reason?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; assented Polwin; &lsquo;I believe that Bowring grew  weary of Trevick&rsquo;s threats about the forged bills, and said that he would tell  of the murder of the Zulu. Then, to save himself, Trevick killed him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As though anyone would care about the death of a  nigger,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent contemptuously; &lsquo;I have been in Africa, Samuel.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, but this Zulu was a young fellow of importance,  the son of a famous witch-doctor whom the Boers were trying to conciliate. He  made a lot of trouble over his son&rsquo;s death, and if Trevick had been caught he  would have suffered imprisonment, if not death. Yes, even now, long ago as it  is; for the witch-doctor took his tribe away and gave the Boers a lot of  trouble. Only the punishment of the witch-doctor&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s assassin will make  that tribe amenable to British rule now that we have taken over the Transvaal.  So, you see, Maria, that Sir Hannibal Trevick, Baronet, had every reason to  fear lest Bowring should go to the Foreign Office and tell what he knew. The  disaffected tribe is an important one, and the Government would do much to get  it quiet, even by hanging the murderer of the man whose skull frightened  Bowring so much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;His skull!&rsquo; gasped Mrs. Krent, terrified; &lsquo;is that scarlet  skull the dead man&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is. It must be some dead man&rsquo;s, you know, Maria.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why should it frighten Mr. Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that, if you hold your confounded  tongue. It seems, as I afterwards heard the story and before I learned the  exact truth, that the witch-doctor &mdash; Moolu, they called him &mdash; thought that  Bowring had killed his son and stolen the diamond. He could not bring the crime  home to him, but he did witchcraft over the business.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What kind of witchcraft?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Krent, fearfully,  for she was superstitious in spite of her gibe at Bowring.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Suggestion,&rsquo; snapped the little man. &lsquo;He cut off the  boy&rsquo;s head, boiled away the flesh, coloured the skull scarlet and bound it  round with a broad silver crown. Then he showed it to Bowring and said that  when he, Bowring, that is, saw it again he would be near death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he kill Bowring at once?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He wanted to torture him. In vain Bowring protested  his innocence. He could not give away Trevick, you know, because of the forged  bills. But Moolu didn&rsquo;t believe Bowring&rsquo;s protestations. He wanted to torture  him with suspense and gloat over his sufferings. And he did torture him. Once  in the Transvaal, Bowring found the skull in his tent, and afterwards was  nearly speared. Then, again, in Cape Town he found it in his room, and he was  knifed at night, but not badly enough to kill him. Moolu had told Bowring that  when he saw the skull three times he would meet with his death. You may  imagine, Maria, that Bowring had a very bad time, seeing that twice he had met  with a narrow escape from death, and knew that the third appearance of the  skull would be fatal. However,&rsquo; added Polwin, with a yawn, &lsquo;he need not have  been so frightened, for when Bowring went to England Moolu died, and there was  no one to carry on the vendetta. But Bowring did not know that, and feared the  third appearance of the skull. Suggestion, you see, Maria? &mdash; merely  suggestion.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you brought the scarlet skull to England. Why?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought it might be useful, as I knew how Bowring  dreaded it. I used it in the tent, as I told you, but upon my soul Maria,&rsquo; the  little man rose and looked serious, &lsquo;knowing that Moolu was dead, I never  thought that any harm would come of the business. I merely placed it in the  tent to frighten Bowring. But he was killed, as you know. I believe that the  talk of the skull being in the tent put the idea of murder in Trevick&rsquo;s head.  But I can&rsquo;t prove anything. However, that is the story. Later we&rsquo;ll tell it to  Miss Trevick, and get evidence to prove Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s guilt. Then she&rsquo;ll hand  over ten thousand pounds a year to me, and I vanish out of your life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wish you were dead with all my heart,&rsquo; muttered  Mrs. Krent, rising.</p>
  <p>Polwin smiled blandly, and gave her a swinging slap on  the face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And now, my dear,&rsquo; he said, just as though he had  kissed her, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take my way back to St. Ewalds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wonder you&rsquo;re not frightened to walk back in the  dark along that lonely road seeing how wicked you are,&rsquo; whimpered Mrs. Krent,  patting her cheek, which was scarlet.</p>
  <p>The little villain laughed jeeringly, and walked  alertly to the door, followed by his ponderous wife. When she opened the hall  door to let him out he paused, and assume a meek, depressed air, worthy of a  great actor; even his face seemed to change into the semblance of a sheep. He  was in one second in all respects the meek Josiah Polwin who had faced Oswald  Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This is the man as he is known in St. Ewalds,&rsquo; said  he in a soft little voice, &lsquo;when you see him, my dear Mrs. Krent, you need not  recognise him. If you do,&rsquo; he straightened himself, and his mean face grew  black and devilish, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll get something like this to think about,&rsquo; and before  the terrified woman could draw back he pinched the fleshy part of her arm so  severely that she uttered a yell. The next moment damp darkness swallowed up  the meek steward, still smiling blandly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; moaned Mrs. Krent, as she dragged herself up to  bed, &lsquo;why haven&rsquo;t I the strength to squeeze the life out of that little beast?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She might well ask this, for it did seem extraordinary  that so large and determined a woman should submit to a mean, cruel dwarf. If  Mrs. Krent had read about Quilp, she might have seen that Polwin&rsquo;s character  had been anticipated in fiction.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Has he gone, mother?&rsquo; asked Jenny, who was waiting at  the head of the stairs, having heard the cry of her parent and the clang of the  door.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, sitting down and beginning to  cry. &lsquo;Jenny, my girl, I fear there are sad days in store for us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Surely not, mother, and you such a good woman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, that I am!&rsquo; moaned Mrs. Krent, rocking herself to  and fro; &lsquo;if I were only wicked I would have killed that man long ago. Why did  he come into my life again?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Get rid of him, mother.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jenny, my dear, I can&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t know what a demon  he is. I&rsquo;ll wait, and in time he&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When we get the money, mother, let us go away and  hide.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent nodded, and kissed the poor, pretty face  which bent over her.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a comfort you are, deary. Yes, we&rsquo;ll go to the  ends of the earth. Samuel will never find us again. Never! never! Where&rsquo;s  Morgan?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I sent him to bed,&rsquo; said Jenny; &lsquo;wait one moment,  mother. I&rsquo;ll see if he is all right and come back and undress you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent assented with a weary sigh, and Jenny  glided away, looking frail and delicate in her flowing dressing-gown of white.  She came back quickly and rather alarmed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Morgan is not in his room.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent started to her feet and became all at once  the active, managing woman she truly was when away from the sinister eyes of  the man who dominated her so entirely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not in his room?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Just as the words left her lips the bolts of the hall  door fell, and it was opened. Snatching the lamp from Jenny, Mrs. Krent ran  down the stairs and found the wind and rain streaming and blowing into the  hall. There was not a sign of Morgan, yet she guessed that the idiot had  slipped down to follow Polwin. His cap and coat were in the hall, so he must  have run into the storm without any protection.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mother! mother!&rsquo; gasped the little wife suddenly  descending the stairs, &lsquo;rouse the servants. We must hunt for Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent shut the hall door with a bang, and put up  the bolts.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My girl, we can do nothing. Morgan has gone out like  this before, and we have never been able to find him; you remember?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. He always comes back again in the morning. But  he has not run out for a long, long time; don&rsquo;t you think &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We can do nothing,&rsquo; interrupted Mrs. Krent harshly;  &lsquo;let us go to bed. The boy will return again in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This was all that could be done, as Morgan frequently,  when the wandering fit took him, escaped on to the moors and returned wet,  footsore and weary in the red dawn. But on this occasion Mrs. Krent doubted if  he had taken to the moors. Rather did she think he was following Polwin along  the lonely, dark road which led to St. Ewalds. And, remembering the man&rsquo;s  jeering remark when he had left, she shuddered to think that he might meet his  death at the hands of the half insane man. But had she reason to believe that  Morgan would kill the steward? Rather did he seem to be afraid of him.  Therefore, utterly helpless, she went to bed, but lay awake for a long time  picturing a gloomy road, and one man creeping stealthily after another one with  murder in his heart.</p>
  <p>She might or might not have been relieved had she  known next morning that Mr. Josiah Polwin was eating a very good breakfast in  the kitchen of the Dower House. He had arrived there without any mishap, and  had gone to his own cottage in the garden without being seen. Now he was meek  and timid, making an excellent meal, never thinking that Morgan Bowring had  been following him on the previous night. And even had he known, Mr. Polwin  would have been quite certain that no harm would have come of the meeting on  the dark and lonely road. Polwin knew how to manage the idiot better than Mrs.  Krent dreamed of.</p>
  <p>But if Polwin was ignorant that Morgan was at large,  Dericka was not. She came down to the breakfast-room in advance of Miss  Lavinia, and after examining the letters to see if by any chance there was one  from her absent father, went to look out of the window. To her surprise she saw  a man asleep on the terrace, and opening the window &mdash; it was a French window &mdash;  she stepped out and touched him with her foot.</p>
  <p>The man sprang up with a weak cry, and she found  herself facing Morgan, who looked more uncanny than ever in the clean morning  light.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo; asked Dericka sharply, but  recoiling.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I came &mdash; I came &mdash;&rsquo; stammered the idiot, quivering  from head to foot, &lsquo;to see you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To see me?&rsquo; Dericka stepped back into the room as the  look in his eyes was not pleasant; &lsquo;what do you mean? No! Stop where you are,&rsquo;  for he showed a desire to enter, and she feared to allow him inside.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am cold,&rsquo; he grumbled, rubbing his hands together;  &lsquo;I came &mdash; I came &mdash; I came &mdash;&rsquo; he went on, hesitating, then his brain seemed to  clear, and a more intelligent look came into his wondering, shifting eyes.  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s about your father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you know of my father?&rsquo; asked Dericka  sharply.</p>
  <p>Morgan uttered a cry. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me,&rsquo; he stammered;  &lsquo;don&rsquo;t hit me, pretty lady.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hit you,&rsquo; said Dericka, in a softer  tone, but keeping her eyes on his vacant face; &lsquo;tell me about my father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m hungry,&rsquo; announced the idiot, his eyes on the  breakfast table behind her, &lsquo;and thirsty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Trevick looked at him for a moment, then the lean  looks of him and his timid glances softened her heart. She went and brought him  a steaming cup of coffee and a crust of bread.</p>
  <p>Morgan grabbed these eagerly and sat down to eat them.  Dericka kept well within the room, ready to shut the window if he showed signs  of violence. She was not exactly afraid, but she judged it best to be wary when  dealing with such a creature.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I like you &mdash; I love you,&rsquo; mumbled Morgan, looking at  her with the affectionate glances of a dog as he drank his coffee and ate the  bread; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re much nicer than Jenny.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Dericka, humouring him; &lsquo;she is your  wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I would rather have you. My father said that I was to  marry you &mdash; yes, he did; but my father is dead. I didn&rsquo;t like my father, you  know,&rsquo; he went on confidentially, &lsquo;he hit me very often. Jenny doesn&rsquo;t hit me,  but Mother Krent does. I&rsquo;d like to slap her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come, come. What are you doing here?&rsquo; said Dericka  sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now you&rsquo;re angry,&rsquo; whimpered the poor creature; &lsquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to make you angry. See!&rsquo; He stooped and kissed Dericka&rsquo;s foot, which  was protruding from the window.</p>
  <p>She withdrew it sharply. &lsquo;Morgan, you must go home,&rsquo;  she said coaxingly for she did not wish him to be here when Miss Lavinia came  down.</p>
  <p>The man rose and wiped his mouth.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rsquo; he announced; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you gave me  food. I like you, but I don&rsquo;t like your father. He killed mine, you know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How dare you say that?&rsquo; flashed out Dericka,  forgetting that she was talking to an irresponsible person.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Polwin says so &mdash; yes, Mr. Polwin &mdash; he showed me  the skull; you know &mdash; the scarlet skull. Oooh!&rsquo;&mdash; Morgan&rsquo;s mouth widened &mdash;&lsquo;how  horrible it is: all blood. One, twice, and the third time death! Ooooh! I am so  afraid. Tell Jenny I want her,&rsquo; he cried piteously; &lsquo;no one understands me but  Jenny-wenny-penny.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Trevick looked at him with a blank face. She  could not understand how the idiot came to be speaking of Polwin and the skull.  Then it flashed into her mind that the steward had been to Africa and might  know something of the Death&rsquo;s Head.</p>
  <p>She was about to ask Morgan a question, when he  suddenly straightened himself and spoke in quite a matter-of-fact tone:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I ran away last night,&rsquo; he said, pulling a dirty  envelope out of his pocket. &lsquo;I was on the road, and then I climbed the moors.  The old witch let me lie down, and Anak &mdash; you know Anak, he is big, isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What about Anak?&rsquo; asked Dericka quietly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He gave me this, and said I was to take it to you. I  did so in the dawn, the red, red dawn, and you gave me food. I must go. I must  dance in the sunlight. See?&rsquo; He thrust the paper into her hand and began to  caper. &lsquo;I can dance like a fairy &mdash; a fairy &mdash; a fairy.&rsquo; Here he skipped off the  terrace and down the avenue, dancing all the way.</p>
  <p>Dericka stood fascinated, with the envelope in her  hand. Finally, just as he was about to caper round the bend, where the trees  would hide him, Morgan blew her a kiss with his finger-tips, and disappeared.  It was like a dream.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And this?&rsquo; murmured Dericka, glancing at the  envelope. It was addressed to herself, and she started. &lsquo;Father&rsquo;s handwriting!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It was indeed. She tore it open and read a few lines.  Sir Hannibal was hiding in a disused mine and wanted to see her. She was to  follow Anak, who would show her the road. Dericka read the lines, and dropped  into a chair. She was too bewildered to think clearly, but this she gathered:  Her father was hiding, and his enemy, Anak, was helping him to hide.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter  XVII<br>
    Under the Earth</b></h2>
  <p>Dericka returned to the cheerful breakfast-room with  the letter in her hand. She could scarcely believe her eyes. That Sir Hannibal  should be so near home as in a tin mine on the moors was extraordinary indeed.  She had thought of him hiding in London, or as having gone abroad to escape  arrest; but never did she suspect for one moment that he was in the  neighbourhood of St. Ewalds. It seemed rash.</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia, prim, and stately as ever, entered to  find her niece considerably perturbed, and was speedily made acquainted with  the contents of the missive brought by the idiot. She was scarcely so surprised  as the girl.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is just the kind of silly thing Hannibal would  do,&rsquo; was her comment. &lsquo;A wise man would have gone abroad until such time as  things had settled down; but Hannibal must needs run his head into the lion&rsquo;s  mouth. I have no patience with the man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka reflected. &lsquo;After all, Aunty, papa may not be  as silly as you think. He could not leave England, as, after the warrant was  issued, all the ports would be watched. If he remained in London you may be  certain that search would be made for him there. To come back here is the last  thing the detective expected.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; corrected Miss Quinton in a chilly  voice, &lsquo;seeing that Arkle came to make enquiries.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, Mr. Arkle can be certain that papa is not  here, so will return to town. But I think papa is wise to hide in one of those  old mining shafts; no one will look for him there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, one would,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia, obstinately;  &lsquo;if Arkle guessed that Hannibal had returned to Cornwall a mining shaft would  be the first place he would search.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He would have his work cut out for him, then,&rsquo; said  Dericka coolly, &lsquo;as there are dozens of those abandoned mines.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And how do you know the right one? Is it here?&rsquo; Miss  Lavinia tapped the letter with her lorgnette.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Aunty, papa has not given away the place of his  refuge even to me. But Morgan Bowring received the letter from Anak, and I  expect Anak will guide us to the place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said the spinster, moving towards the  fire, &lsquo;there is no need to keep such an incriminating letter.&rsquo; She dropped it  into the heart of the burning coals and sat down at the breakfast table. &lsquo;Come  my dear, eat and drink; you must keep up your strength.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have no appetite,&rsquo; replied Dericka, sitting down to  pour out the coffee with a sigh.</p>
  <p>Miss Lavinia passed her a plate of eggs and bacon with  a severe look.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear girl, you have no faith. Since Providence has  helped my poor brother-inlaw so far, Providence will save him yet. Providence,&rsquo;  added Miss Quinton, with uncomplimentary fervour, &lsquo;watches over drunken men,  fools and bairns. I need hardly mention which of those your father is, my dear  child.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you think that he is innocent?&rsquo; asked Dericka,  beginning to eat.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes and no. I have made up my mind once or twice, and  have unmade it three or four times. Let us wait and see. What do you intend to  do, Dericka?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Oswald about that letter, and walk with him  to Anak&rsquo;s hut. Then we will see papa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This arrangement having been made, the girl ate a good  meal in spite of her anxiety, recognising Miss Quinton&rsquo;s good sense in advising  her to take things quietly. Within half an hour Forde entered the room, and to  him Miss Trevick related her experience with Morgan Bowring. Forde was  extremely astonished, but rubbed his hands, well pleased at what he had been  told.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Oswald, nodding, &lsquo;we shall hear the  truth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;From Hannibal?&rsquo; scoffed Miss Lavinia; &lsquo;what an  unlikely person to trust. Hannibal will tell as much as will suit him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll have to tell the whole, then,&rsquo; said the young  barrister, somewhat grimly; &lsquo;that is, if he wants to save his skin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Quinton nodded severely and took up her knitting,  while Dericka went to her room to dress for the walk to the moors. When she had  gone the spinster lifted her hard eyes enquiringly and mutely questioned the  barrister as to his plans. Having none for the moment, he did not explain  himself, but merely walked to the fire, saying: &lsquo;I wish the letter had been  kept, so that I could have seen it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was nothing in it but what you know, Mr. Forde.  And it is not wise to keep such a document in a house which may at any time be  raided by detectives.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is any chance of that. Arkle is  satisfied.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He must be a fool, then,&rsquo; said Miss Lavinia, jerking  his chin in the air and knitting with redoubled vigour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let us hope that he is for Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; said  Forde dryly.</p>
  <p>While they were talking Dericka, hatted and cloaked,  came into the room looking remarkably pretty, if somewhat anxious. Behind her  appeared another woman, quietly dressed and with a scared face, pale and sweet,  although somewhat doll-like.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Aunty! Oswald!&rsquo; said Miss Trevick, stepping aside to  introduce the stranger, &lsquo;this is Mrs. Bowring, who has come to tell us something.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! No! Really, Miss Trevick,&rsquo; protested Jenny,  looking more scared than ever; &lsquo;I really came to see what has become of Morgan.  He got out of the house last night,&rsquo; she went on, addressing all three  impartially, &lsquo;and, having searched the moors, I met Anak, who told me that he  had come on here with a letter to Miss Trevick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He did come, as I explained,&rsquo; replied Dericka, &lsquo;but  he went away over an hour ago, and I thought that he had gone home.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He has not arrived yet,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bowring anxiously,  &lsquo;and I came by the direct road.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Probably an idiot like that would go by the second  road, which is the longer,&rsquo; suggested Miss Quinton; &lsquo;people of weak intellect  always do exactly the opposite to what sane folk do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jenny sank into a seat and clasped her hands, looking  weary and worn and tired out with worry. Dericka glanced at her for a moment,  then left the room to return with a glass of port wine which she made her  drink.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You must keep up your strength,&rsquo; said Dericka, boldly  plagiarising from her aunt.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thank you, Miss Trevick; how good you are. Oh, I&rsquo;ll  do what I can to help you,&rsquo; cried the poor, tired-looking doll.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do what?&rsquo; questioned Miss Quinton sharply. Before  Jenny could reply Forde intervened.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One moment,&rsquo; he said, anxious to settle a question which  had been in his mind since Jenny had mentioned about her meeting with Anak;  &lsquo;did that man, Hugh Carney, tell you what was in the letter he gave your  husband?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no; how could he, sir? Anak did not know himself.  He would not open a letter which belonged to Miss Stretton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde stepped back a pace in his surprise. &lsquo;Miss  Stretton!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. Anak said that she dropped this letter, which  was directed to you, Miss Trevick, on the floor of his mother&rsquo;s hut. He ran  after her to return it, but Miss Stretton had vanished. Anak therefore gave it  to Morgan, whom he met on the moors. You see,&rsquo; added Mrs. Bowring  apologetically, &lsquo;Anak could not leave the quarries himself, as he is the  foreman, and has to start the men to work.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde turned away, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. This  explanation showed him that Anak was still the enemy of Sir Hannibal, and that  Miss Stretton was the sole person cognisant of the baronet&rsquo;s hidingplace.</p>
  <p>While he reflected how he could meet her and have a  chat, Dericka was talking to Mrs. Bowring, whose white face had now more colour  in it, thanks to the generous vintage.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it you wanted to tell me?&rsquo; she asked softly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t tell mother that I told you?&rsquo; entreated  Mrs. Bowring, looking somewhat fearful; &lsquo;she would never forgive me. But that  man is such a trial to mother that she cannot fight him singlehanded. I know  that you are clever, Miss Trevick, so I thought that you might help mother; and  of course,&rsquo; added the doll with emphasis, &lsquo;it will help your father also.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde wheeled round.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he asked sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I crept downstairs when mother was talking to the  man,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bowring, feverishly, &lsquo;and I heard nearly all they were saying.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who is the man?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr. Polwin &mdash; but that is not his real name.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; Forde rubbed his chin again and recalled the  meek little steward. &lsquo;And what is his name, Mrs. Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Samuel Krent. He is my mother&rsquo;s husband.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; ejaculated Dericka, &lsquo;your father?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no, no, how can you think so? My father was  called Ward. Mr. Krent is my mother&rsquo;s second husband. He is a wicked man, and  she is very much afraid of him. Had she known that he was here she would have  run away miles and miles.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What, that sheep dangerous?&rsquo; murmured Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t a sheep, Miss Trevick, but a very terrible man.  He bullied mother last night and struck her and pinched her. Oh, don&rsquo;t tell Mr.  Polwin that I listened,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bowring, piteously, &lsquo;or he will hurt me. He  will indeed; you don&rsquo;t know what a terrible man he is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If he&rsquo;s the biggest blackguard in England I&rsquo;m equal  to him,&rsquo; said the barrister quickly and grimly. &lsquo;Go on, Mrs. Bowring, tell me  all that you overhead and then we&rsquo;ll send for Mr. Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The little woman sprang up and clutched Forde&rsquo;s arm.  &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; she panted, much terrified; &lsquo;if you tell him I&rsquo;ll say  nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I think &mdash;&rsquo; began Dericka, only to be cut short by  her aunt.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bowring is perfectly right,&rsquo; said that oracle;  &lsquo;if Polwin, or Krent, or whatever he calls himself, is dangerous, it would be  folly to put him on his guard by letting him see that he is suspected.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde nodded.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I agree!&rsquo; He went to the door and closed it  carefully, then returned and placed a chair for Mrs. Bowring in the midst of  the room, beckoning to Miss Lavinia and Dericka to likewise draw their chairs  up to the doll. Then he seated himself at her ear and leaned forward. &lsquo;Tell us  all, in a whisper.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Bowring cast a terrified glance round the  apartment, then &mdash; in a whisper, as she had been advised &mdash; related nearly the  entire conversation which her mother had held with Polwin on the previous  night.</p>
  <p>Miss Quinton&rsquo;s face grew more and more severe as she  heard about her brother-inlaw&rsquo;s African life, and Forde nodded at intervals  with a satisfied air.</p>
  <p>Dericka, her blue eyes fastened on the swiftly moving  lips of the whispering girl, alone showed no sign of emotion. Then the story  was finished. Forde pushed back his chair.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can return home, Mrs. Bowring,&rsquo; he said softly,  &lsquo;resting assured that neither Mr. Polwin nor your mother, nor anyone else, will  hear what you have told us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And will you do anything to help mother?&rsquo; faltered  the doll.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Later on, no doubt. At present we must all keep  silence so as to give Polwin enough rope to hang himself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you think he is guilty?&rsquo; asked Dericka swiftly.</p>
  <p>Forde answered evasively: &lsquo;I cannot say as yet, I must  wait. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bowring, go home and say nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jenny nodded faintly, and gathering her cloak around  her took her leave. She looked very frail and ill as she walked down the  avenue, but the three left behind had more to think about than Mrs. Bowring&rsquo;s  health, and looked at one another.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Will you see Polwin?&rsquo; asked Miss Trevick, reading  Forde&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not just now, but it will be as well to learn what he  is doing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka rang the bell and asked if the steward was in  the house. It appeared that Polwin had been there to breakfast, but had gone to  the quarries on business.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He took the master&rsquo;s motor-bicycle,&rsquo; said the servant  respectfully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; asked Miss Quinton when the door closed and  the trio were again alone; &lsquo;what is to be done?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka and I will go to Miss Stretton&rsquo;s studio,&rsquo;  said Forde unexpectedly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, Oswald?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because Miss Stretton will guide us to the  mining-shaft wherein your father is hidden.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But the letter said that Anak would guide us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the barrister, vexedly, &lsquo;I wish I had seen  that letter. I am sure from what Mrs. Bowring said that Anak knows nothing  about the matter, and, moreover, on account of his mother, he is your father&rsquo;s  enemy. The name, my dear Dericka, was not Anak but Anne; you have made a  mistake.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I might have done so,&rsquo; said Dericka, thoughtfully;  &lsquo;papa&rsquo;s writing is none of the best. At all events, we might see Miss  Stretton.&rsquo; And, having settled this, the two lovers left the house for the  studio of the lady in question.</p>
  <p>Anne was within, looking somewhat anxious and pale.  When Forde explained about the missing letter her face cleared.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am so glad,&rsquo; she said, clasping her hands; &lsquo;I could  not think where I had lost that letter. Did Anak read it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rsquo; said Forde, recalling what Jenny  had related.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps it will be better for Sir Hannibal to hide in  another mine?&rsquo; murmured Miss Stretton, meditatively.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you know where papa is?&rsquo; said Dericka quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. He wrote to me from town, saying that he had  been warned that a warrant was out against him and stating that he would have  to hide until he could prepare his defence. I advised him to come here. He did  so in disguise, and got out at Gwynne Station. I met him there and drove him in  Mr. Penrith&rsquo;s cart on to the moors. It was my idea that he should hide in the  Pengelly mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Dericka quickly, &lsquo;I know that mine. It is  just near Mr. Penrith&rsquo;s place, a mile or so beyond the quarries.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. If you go down the shaft and sing &ldquo;Home, Sweet  Home&rdquo;, Sir Hannibal will call out, and then you will see him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Home, Sweet Home&rdquo;,&rsquo; echoed Forde, smiling in spite  of his anxiety. &lsquo;What an ironical song to sing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We had to choose some sort of signal,&rsquo; said Anne  tartly, for she was worn out and short-tempered; &lsquo;will you go yourselves, or  shall I come with you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We shall go ourselves,&rsquo; said Miss Trevick after a  moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &lsquo;and you, Miss Stretton, must lie down.&rsquo; She moved  forward, then suddenly kissed Anne&rsquo;s dark cheek. &lsquo;I have been unjust to you,&rsquo;  said Dericka frankly; &lsquo;you have been, and are, my father&rsquo;s best friend.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you won&rsquo;t dislike me any more?&rsquo; faltered Anne,  rather touched by this action of so usually an undemonstrative girl.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! And if papa marries you I think it will be the  best thing for him. Good-bye, now. We can talk of these things later.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne looked out of the window at the two as they  walked down the narrow street, and turned away with a sigh. She was well  satisfied that she had saved Sir Hannibal for the time being, and had gained  the good graces of his daughter, but she felt tired out with the strain, and  went immediately to bed. As she fell asleep she wondered what would be the  outcome of all these things. &lsquo;And I wonder,&rsquo; murmured Anne, yawning, &lsquo;if I&rsquo;ll  marry Sir Hannibal after all?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Forde, returning to the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Arms&rsquo;,  secured the trap in which he had driven on the previous day to the quarries,  and explained to Mrs. Tregar that he intended to take Miss Trevick for a drive  on the moors.</p>
  <p>Dericka did not like the curious way in which the  landlady looked at her, as she felt certain it was simply because of the  misfortune which had befallen her father. But Mrs. Tregar soon disabused her  mind of this.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard, dear Miss, that Morgan Bowring is married  to Mrs. Krent&rsquo;s daughter,&rsquo; said Mrs. Tregar beaming, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m so glad for Mr.  Forde&rsquo;s sake and for yours.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thank you, Mrs. Tregar, but my father would never  have insisted upon my marrying Morgan Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I should think not, Miss, and you engaged to such a  handsome young gentleman. When will the marriage take place, Miss?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka sighed. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rsquo; she replied quietly;  &lsquo;we are in great trouble, Mrs. Tregar.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take that to heart, Miss,&rsquo; entreated Mrs.  Tregar. &lsquo;Your pa will come out white as moor snow. Him guilty? I wouldn&rsquo;t  believe that,&rsquo; concluded the landlady stoutly, &lsquo;if all the judges and jury in  Great Britain said as much. There!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>While Dericka was thanking this sympathetic friend  Forde came to say that the trap was waiting, and in a few minutes they drove  away. Oswald had brought the driver, as it would be necessary to leave someone  in charge of the vehicle while they went on the moors.</p>
  <p>The day was fine after the rain, and the air breathed  clean and fresh, especially when they came to the top of the hill overlooking  St. Ewalds. The two said very little during the journey, since what they had to  speak about was not meant for the driver&rsquo;s ears, and an unguarded remark might  reveal too much.</p>
  <p>They drove past the scene of the murder, past the  quarries, where the men were working hard, and rounded the curve behind which  lay Penrith&rsquo;s village and Manor House. The hamlet was of grey stone,  severe-looking and bleak, and so suited to the grimness of the country that it  appeared as though it was the work of Nature. The Penriths had been settled in  these parts before the Flood, and both village and Manor House were called  after their name.</p>
  <p>Forde, informed by Miss Trevick, knew that the  Pengelly mine was not very far up the hill, which hung above the winding road,  and therefore instructed the driver to take the trap to the &lsquo;Penrith Crest&rsquo;,  the sole public-house of the village. He and Dericka alighted on the road just  under the hill, and choosing a sheep-track, climbed the steep, stony ascent,  which was covered with bracken and wiry grass, and sown thickly with lumps of  granite.</p>
  <p>On the top there appeared a mighty cromlech, and here,  somewhat out of breath, they halted for a few minutes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Dericka, pointing to a tall chimney some  distance away.</p>
  <p>Forde nodded, but wasting no words, since time was  valuable, led the way down the slope of the hill to the depression, where the  abandoned mining works littered the ground. They made their way amongst rubble  and refuse, and under broken roofs, and between ruined outhouses. The gaping  mouth of the mine yawned near the tall chimney, and on approaching the brink  they saw a very perpendicular ladder going down into the depths.</p>
  <p>Miss Trevick remembered that a few months before the  mine had been reopened by a London speculator, who had drained the levels and  readjusted the ladder; but since the work had proved unremunerative, he had  abandoned the mine. Still, the depths were clear of water, and comparatively  safe, and it was here that Sir Hannibal had found refuge.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How horrid!&rsquo; said Dericka, after she had imparted  this information to her companion.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me go,&rsquo; suggested Forde; &lsquo;you stop here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka gave him one look of indignant surprise and  replied by placing a dainty foot on the ladder. In a moment or so she disappeared,  and Forde, admiring her courage, followed with due care.</p>
  <p>Down and down the adventurers dropped into the humid  gloom, carefully feeling their way as they approached the unknown. Oswald heard  Dericka singing the inappropriate tune which was to be the signal to Sir  Hannibal that friends were at hand. He guessed that she had reached the level  wherein the baronet had taken up his abode like a troglodyte. Strangely enough,  both had forgotten the necessity of taking lanterns or candles, and found  themselves involved in deepest gloom a considerable distance below the earth&rsquo;s  surface.</p>
  <p>Hand in hand they lingered at the foot of the long  ladder which led to the upper world, and shivered in the damp atmosphere.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rsquo; asked Dericka in a whisper, for  the place was awesome in its loneliness.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sing again,&rsquo; suggested the barrister; &lsquo;these long  galleries carry sound for great distances.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>In a somewhat tremulous manner Miss Trevick lifted up  a voice clear, sweet and true as that of a lark, and the silvery sound vibrated  throughout the sullen depths. Minute after minute passed, and Forde was  beginning to think that they had mistaken the mine when far away his quick eye  caught the glimmer of a candle.</p>
  <p>Seizing the girl&rsquo;s hand, he guided her towards the  gleam, and they stumbled over trolley-rails laid down on the wet uneven ground.  At times they had to stop in case they should knock their heads against the  dripping roof. The gleam grew stronger and stronger, and once or twice  disappeared. When this happened Dericka again sang a snatch of song, and the  light reappeared.</p>
  <p>Finally, at the end of the gallery, and within a  circle of light, they saw the form of a man.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Father!&rsquo; called out Miss Trevick in her strong, young  voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;At last,&rsquo; Sir Hannibal called back, and in tremulous  tones; &lsquo;oh, thank Heaven that you have come, Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII<br>
    A Discovery</b></h2>
  <p>Miss Trevick, still holding on to Forde, stretched out  her hand to the baronet, who, grasping it firmly, drew her and the barrister  round a curve in the gallery and led them some distance further on. Then he  stepped off the trolley-lines, and, setting down the light on a deal box,  illuminated three or four other candles, until there was quite a blaze of  light. The visitors found themselves in a kind of niche which had been hollowed  out of the live rock by former workers in the mine. The floor of this niche was  slightly above the level of the gallery, and therefore was comparatively dry.</p>
  <p>By the light of the candles Dericka saw a pile of  dried bracken and grass in one corner, which, as she guessed, served her  unfortunate father for a bed. There was also a box containing provisions, and a  wood fire smouldered on the verge of the niche, where the smoke could ascend  through the gallery. There were no seats, naturally, and the trio had to sit on  the rocky ground, which, fortunately, was dry.</p>
  <p>Having taken in these details of this cave of Adullam,  Dericka looked at her father, and was surprised to see what a change there was  in his appearance. Formerly he had been a well-preserved, elderly gentleman,  handsome and haughty. Now he was worn and pale, white-haired, and unshaven. His  shoulders were bowed, and his waxen face was wrinkled, while his eyes appeared  dull and unintelligent.</p>
  <p>Dericka was terribly shocked to see what a wreck the  poor man had become, and gasped as she looked. Her emotions were too deep to  find vent in mere words. Sir Hannibal guessed what she felt, and also he caught  sight of the pained expression in Forde&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Trevick bitterly, &lsquo;you may well look  startled, both of you. This is a change from the Dower House.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A change that will not last long,&rsquo; said Forde with a  brisk confidence he was far from feeling, &lsquo;you will soon be back again, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, that depends,&rsquo; said Trevick significantly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Father!&rsquo; Dericka caught his hand convulsively; &lsquo;you  will never make me believe that you killed Mr. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, dear; no.&rsquo; The baronet patted her hand and seemed  pleased to hear her speak in this manner. &lsquo;I am, of course, perfectly innocent,  but I have enemies who will use all means to ruin me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why, father?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; Sir Hannibal heaved a weary sigh; &lsquo;that is a  long story.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And probably,&rsquo; remarked Forde quickly, &lsquo;the very  story we have come to hear, Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The hunted man looked up quickly in his turn.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Since you left Gwynne Station for London,&rsquo; went on  the barrister, &lsquo;we &mdash; that is, Dericka and myself &mdash; have heard strange things.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;About me?&rsquo; Trevick&rsquo;s breath came quickly.</p>
  <p>Forde nodded. &lsquo;Yes; and about Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin &mdash; my steward?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Dericka pointedly; &lsquo;about your steward,  Samuel Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The baronet started, and squeezed his daughter&rsquo;s hand  so severely that she winced.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you know that Polwin&rsquo;s name is Krent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Dericka, mimicking her father&rsquo;s former  speech, &lsquo;that is a long story.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your tone, my child,&rsquo; said Sir  Hannibal, trying to suppress his agitation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t understand one another,&rsquo; remarked Forde with  a shrug. &lsquo;It will be best that you should tell us everything.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;About what?&rsquo; asked the baronet, persistently  obstinate.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;About the Death&rsquo;s Head, for one thing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know nothing about that, Forde.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What, not about Moolu and his &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who told you that?&rsquo; interrupted Trevick imperiously,  and much agitated by the significant tone of the barrister.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who is she? Bowring&rsquo;s wife died years ago.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I mean young Mrs. Bowring &mdash; Morgan&rsquo;s wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know about that secret marriage, then,&rsquo; stammered  Trevick.</p>
  <p>Forde looked at him steadily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You seem to have forgotten a great deal, Sir Hannibal,&rsquo;  said he dryly; &lsquo;of course we know. Do you remember some time ago, we &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; Sir Hannibal interrupted again; &lsquo;of  course. The rumour was to be put about that I agreed to Dericka marrying  Morgan, and then Mrs. Krent was to announce the former marriage. I know &mdash; I  know; but, what with trouble and nervous fears, I forget much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Poor father,&rsquo; said Miss Trevick softly; &lsquo;but we have  not much time to remain here, father. Tell us all quickly, and we will see how  you can come back to the Dower House.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I cannot do that, Dericka. Things are too black  against me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You must come, father; you must meet your accusers.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka, I dare not face that warrant. I was absent  from the fete when Bowring was killed, but how can I prove that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin can prove it,&rsquo; said Forde quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal bitterly. &lsquo;The man  is a villain, and wants to ruin me. Why, I can&rsquo;t say, seeing that he has  received nothing but kindness at my hands.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Many people resent kindness,&rsquo; said Forde, with a  shrug, &lsquo;and try to harm the person who has benefited them. But the position is  this, Sir Hannibal; Polwin declares that after Miss Stretton left the fete with  Mr. Penrith you went out on your motor-bicycle by the second road, which runs  behind the hill. He &mdash; Polwin, that is &mdash; met you somewhere on the moors, and you  asked him if he had seen Miss Stretton. He had not, as they had driven by the  other road. Had you gone by that one, you would have caught them up. As it was,  you gave the bicycle to Polwin and sent him on to Penrith Manor with a letter  for Miss Stretton. Then you &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then I returned to St. Ewalds,&rsquo; continued Trevick  quickly, &lsquo;but not to the fete. Listen, Forde, and you, Dericka. I love Miss  Stretton, I want to marry her. On the day of the fete had you not appeared I  should have asked her to be my wife. But there was no time, and she went away  with Penrith, who I knew was in love with her. I thought he might propose  before I did and that I would lose Anne. I therefore wrote a hasty letter  asking her to be my wife, and took my motor-bicycle, intending to catch her up  and give her the letter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Was there any need of such a letter?&rsquo; asked Dericka  pointedly. &lsquo;You could have caught up Miss Stretton and proposed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What, when Penrith was there? How ridiculous you are,  Dericka. I intended to slip the letter into her hand on some excuse and then  return. Unfortunately I took the second road, whereas Penrith had driven home  by the first road.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where the murder took place?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Precisely. When I was on the second road, about  opposite to this mine, I met Polwin coming across the hill from the quarries. I  was tired, and asked him to take the motor-bicycle and follow up Miss Stretton.  He consented. Then I walked home and strolled on the beach below the Manor  House until dinner time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you not return to the fete?&rsquo; asked Dericka.</p>
  <p>The baronet&rsquo;s pale cheek reddened.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was in love, you see, Dericka, as I am now, and  wished to think of the woman I loved. But you see I cannot prove an alibi, as  no one to my knowledge saw me on the beach. Consequently, as Bowring, with whom  I had quarrelled, was murdered at the time, I am in a dangerous position.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Stretton saw you on the bank near the granite  mass which was afterwards heaved on to the road to smash Bowring&rsquo;s motor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Forde!&rsquo; said the baronet, starting violently when the  barrister made this speech. &lsquo;Miss Stretton is my friend: she would not say  that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is it true, father?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Dericka; on my soul it is not true. I acted as I  said, and when Polwin went off on the motor I walked back to wander on the  beach.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka looked at Forde, and he at her.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Strange!&rsquo; said the barrister, much puzzled. &lsquo;I  wonder, Sir Hannibal, if anyone was masquerading as you? Miss Stretton declares  that she saw you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who can or who did masquerade as me,&rsquo;  said Trevick calmly, &lsquo;but I assuredly was not near the scene of the murder at  that time. But you had better tell me all you know, and then we may see light.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you everything,&rsquo; said Forde, after a pause;  &lsquo;but in return you must be absolutely frank.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I promise that. Go on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The barrister was obliged to be content with this curt  promise, and therefore related all that had taken place since his arrival in  St. Ewalds. He related the interview with Polwin, the visit of Morgan with the  letter dropped by Miss Stretton in Anak&rsquo;s hut, and finally detailed the strange  story about Polwin, alias Krent, related by young Mrs. Bowring.</p>
  <p>Trevick listened quietly, with his hand in that of his  daughter, and did not interrupt until nearly the end of the story. Then his  frequent interruptions showed how indignant he was. Finally, when Oswald had  nearly, but not quite, concluded, his indignation took the form of words.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have told quite enough,&rsquo; he said angrily; &lsquo;Krent  is my enemy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; cried Dericka, &lsquo;do you think that he killed Mr.  Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal sharply; &lsquo;he and Bowring were  hand in glove to ruin me. There is considerable truth in what Mrs. Krent says,  and some truth in her husband&rsquo;s story. Polwin, or Krent, or whatever he chooses  to call himself, is a villain. He was in partnership with myself and Bowring in  Africa, but we had to kick him out since he behaved so badly. He was always  getting us into trouble with the natives.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is it true about the forged bills?&rsquo; asked Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perfectly true. But I never held them in terror over  Bowring. I simply kept them so that he should not do me any harm. I don&rsquo;t say  that all the business I did over diamonds in Africa was altogether straight,  but I was no worse than anyone else. Bowring knew everything, and frequently  threatened to make use of his knowledge in St. Ewalds to ruin me. But I said  that if he did I would prosecute him for forging the bills. The bills,&rsquo;  repeated Sir Hannibal bitterly; &lsquo;yes, Bowring forged them in an evil hour, and  I obtained possession of them through Krent. Bowring was making all the money  and had no need to forge; but he did it in order to bring off a big deal. I  could not get the money from him, and consequently he became the millionaire,  while I remained poor.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But with the bills you could have got the money,&rsquo;  suggested Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Trevick quietly. &lsquo;I did not care about  blackmail. I have done many wrong things, but not that, Forde.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But if the money coming from sale of the diamonds was  partly yours, Sir Hannibal, you should have received it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so. When I was in Cape Town, and Bowring up in  the Rand, he used my name by these forged bills to get money, and bought a lot  of diamonds, intending to bolt. Through Krent, however &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Call him Polwin, father; we will understand better.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal nodded and amended his statement.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Through Polwin I got hold of the bills and swore to  prosecute Bowring should he try to clear out with the diamonds, half of which  were rightfully mine. He agreed and stopped on. Then came the episode of the  Death&rsquo;s Head, and that to some extent placed me in his power.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Father!&rsquo; cried Dericka, alarmed, &lsquo;did you kill  Moolu&rsquo;s son?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. It was Bowring; but he and Polwin for their own  ends put the blame on to me, and as the diamond which Moolu&rsquo;s son possessed,  and for which Bowring killed him, was in my possession, things looked black  against me. Bowring gave me the diamond, and refused to take it back.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you not throw it away?&rsquo; asked Forde quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear boy, the diamond was worth five thousand  pounds and, moreover, my throwing it away would not have proved me innocent.  Bowring fastened his own guilt on me, and Polwin was prepared to swear that I  killed the Zulu. I left Africa almost as poor as I went out there, and settled  in St. Ewalds. The rest of my life, Dericka, you know from personal  observation.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But surely Bowring gave you some money?&rsquo; said Forde,  puzzled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A little. I was in his power, as I tell you, as he  was in mine. He could prove me guilty of murdering the Zulu, and I could  prosecute him with the bills. And then&rsquo;&mdash; Sir Hannibal hesitated &mdash;&lsquo;I may as well  make a clean breast of it, Dericka. I sold Moolu&rsquo;s diamond to keep things going  here, so you see the chances were that had Bowring told his story I should have  been proved guilty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How rash!&rsquo; sighed the girl, much disturbed by these  unpleasant revelations; &lsquo;but how did Mr. Bowring come to the Grange?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I made him,&rsquo; said Trevick quickly and sharply;  &lsquo;things were at a deadlock, so I agreed to wait until Bowring&rsquo;s death before getting  back the money which should rightfully have been mine. In fact, to make him pay  for what he had done, I insisted that he should leave me his whole fortune. He  did so on the condition that Dericka should marry Morgan, but that condition  was not embodied in the will. I made Bowring take the Grange so as to keep him  under my own eye, and then Krent came home under the name of Polwin, and as he  knew so much I had to engage him as my steward.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But see here,&rsquo; said Forde, espying a flaw in the  story, &lsquo;Moolu believed that Bowring had killed his son.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And Moolu was right,&rsquo; said Trevick bitterly; &lsquo;he was  cleverer than the white men, who believed me guilty. Oh, you need not look so  surprised, Dericka,&rsquo; he added quickly; &lsquo;there were certain suspicions against me,  but with Bowring and Polwin people could prove nothing. But things were  sufficiently unpleasant to make me leave Africa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was a long pause, then Forde spoke.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The whole thing is very involved, Sir Hannibal, and  although you are not free from blame, yet I for one believe you to be innocent.  But this Death&rsquo;s Head?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never knew that Polwin had it,&rsquo; said the baronet  quickly, &lsquo;and I quite believe that he would try to frighten Bowring with it.  Moolu did tell Bowring that when he saw it three times he would die, and in  Africa, to my knowledge, he saw it twice.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then it appears to me,&rsquo; said Forde slowly, &lsquo;that as  Polwin was the sole person who knew of the significance of the Death&rsquo;s Head,  and was the man who used it to prophecy Bowring&rsquo;s death, that Polwin is the  guilty party.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka shook her head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, with great decision; &lsquo;Polwin seemed  puzzled as any of us over Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s death according to what Jenny  overheard. He might have used the Death&rsquo;s Head to frighten Mr. Bowring, but I  don&rsquo;t see how he could have killed him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you think, Sir Hannibal?&rsquo; asked Forde, after  reflection.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I agree with Dericka,&rsquo; said Trevick promptly. &lsquo;Polwin  had more use for Bowring alive than dead. While Bowring lived Polwin could, and  did &mdash; as I happen to know &mdash; get money out of him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Can you suggest anyone who killed him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No; no more than I can suggest who masqueraded as  myself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Forde dryly, and rising, &lsquo;for if you knew  the masquerader you would know, as we should, who is the assassin. Well, Sir  Hannibal, after hearing your story I agree with you that it will be best for  you to remain here until such time as we can establish your innocence.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But how is that to be done?&rsquo; asked Dericka, rising  also.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin is the person who can clear things up,&rsquo; said  Forde, &lsquo;and I intend to speak to him. Perhaps, Sir Hannibal, you can help us to  force Polwin&rsquo;s hand?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The baronet shook his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. I can say nothing against Polwin but what he can  say something against me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;See here,&rsquo; asked Forde sharply; &lsquo;have you told us  everything?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the baronet unhesitatingly. &lsquo;I have been  foolish, and perhaps even reckless, but I am not a criminal. Go away and think  over things, then return and tell me what is best to be done. I am all right  here; and, Dericka, bring me a bottle of port wine when you come again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>With a heavy heart Dericka promised to do this, and  the lovers took their way along the shaft and up the ladder again to the upper  world.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; she asked Forde, when they were again  descending the hill.</p>
  <p>The young man shook his head. &lsquo;I can make nothing of  it at present,&rsquo; he declared, &lsquo;and talk will only confuse us both further. Let  us agree to leave the matter alone for a few days, Dericka, and then things may  straighten themselves out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But my father?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He will be all right where he is,&rsquo; said Forde, and no  more was said for the time being.</p>
  <p>And indeed next day they heard something which  introduced a new element into the already mysterious case. The information came  from no less a person than Mrs. Krent.</p>
  <p>That good lady appeared at the Dower House late in the  afternoon in a great state of perturbation, and asked to see Miss Trevick.</p>
  <p>As luck would have it, Forde also was on the spot,  paying his usual visit, and Mrs. Krent was ushered into the library, wherein  the two lovers sat. Miss Quinton, feeling that two was company and three none,  had gone out to pay a round of visits, so the lovers were quite alone. Dericka  glanced nervously at Forde when she beheld the bulky form of Mrs. Krent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; said the housekeeper, throwing back her  bonnet strings, and looking redder than ever, &lsquo;that you, sir, and your young  lady believe me when I say that I care nothing for money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Forde signing that Dericka should be  silent; &lsquo;I think that is so, seeing how moderate your demands for money have  been.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, producing a blue  envelope, &lsquo;you could have knocked me down with a feather when I came across  this,&rsquo; and she handed the document to Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked Dericka, while Forde opened the  envelope.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My dear young lady, it&rsquo;s a second will leaving  everything to Morgan Bowring. Your father takes nothing, Morgan gets all.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>Chapter  XIX<br>
    What Happened Next</b></h2>
  <p>Forde stopped opening the blue envelope when Mrs.  Krent made this amazing announcement as to the new disposal of Bowring&rsquo;s  property, and, together with Dericka, stared at the messenger of ill tidings.</p>
  <p>The stout, elderly housekeeper, who was still attired  in the incongruous costume which she loved, fanned her red face with a flimsy  handkerchief and arranged her dyed yellow curls under the juvenile bonnet.  Blandly surveying the astonished lovers, she continued her monologue.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You could have knocked me down with a feather,&rsquo; she  repeated, when she could get her breath, &lsquo;when I came across that second will&rsquo;&mdash;  she nodded towards the blue envelope in Forde&rsquo;s hand &mdash;&lsquo;in a desk which was in  Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s room. I was just putting it tidy-like, and pulled out all the  drawers to dust them, when in the top one on the right-hand side I saw the  envelope: sealed, it was, and then found that Mr. Bowring had made a second  will. There&rsquo;s a note with it,&rsquo; added Mrs. Krent, gasping for breath. &lsquo;If you  read it, sir, you will see that Bowring&rsquo;s repented leaving the money to Sir  Hannibal, but says that he was compelled to do so. However, since he&rsquo;s dead,  nothing matters, and he wanted to show Sir Hannibal that he would not be  trifled with. He asks me also to be a friend to Morgan, which I&rsquo;m sure I am,  seeing he&rsquo;s married to my dear Jenny, though to be sure, Bowring never guessed  that such was the case.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Again she gasped, and this time, being really out of  breath, held her clacking tongue for the moment. Dericka was wise enough to say  nothing, and Forde silently took out the new will. It was written on a sheet of  foolscap, and seemed legal enough, seeing that it was duly attested and  witnessed. In this document, which was short and to the point, John Bowring had  left the money to his son Morgan, but if was held in trust by Mrs. Krent, who  was to receive one thousand a year for her trouble. In the note which was  inside the will, and addressed to the housekeeper, Bowring wrote that Mrs.  Krent was his only friend, that he was in the power of Sir Hannibal, and would  have to leave the money to him or else face a law court on account of certain  forged bills. He had made such a will in order to satisfy Trevick, but in the  enclosed document &mdash; a later-executed testament &mdash; had left the money to his son,  as was only right. There were a few expressions of satisfaction showing that Bowring  was glad he had succeeded in cheating the baronet, and there the latter ended  with the bold signature of the millionaire and two names of witnesses. These  were badly written, and proved as Forde afterwards learned, to be those of two  servants who worked at the Grange.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the young barrister, when he had made  himself acquainted with this document and had replaced it in the blue envelope,  &lsquo;I must say this is a nice state of things.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But no more than Sir Hannibal deserves,&rsquo; cried Mrs.  Krent in a defensive manner. &lsquo;He had no right to force Bowring to leave the  money away from Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not all of it, perhaps,&rsquo; assented the young  barrister, &lsquo;but you must be aware, Mrs. Krent, that part of this sixty thousand  a year belongs to Sir Hannibal Trevick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that at all, sir,&rsquo; she retorted, &lsquo;seeing  that Bowring made every penny by the sweat of his brow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Humph! I rather think it was other people who  sweated, Mrs. Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you know, sir?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I happen to have seen Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you know where he is, sir?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Krent  suspiciously.</p>
  <p>The young lawyer saw that he had made a mistake, and,  colouring with vexation, held his tongue.</p>
  <p>Dericka, who was watchful of his emotion, entered the  breach and addressed herself to the stout house-keeper.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; she said, in a cold and icy tone, &lsquo;you  must be aware that my father is wrongly accused?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If he did not murder Bowring, who did?&rsquo; snapped the  other.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, that is what we have to learn. But I can tell you  with safety that my father is hiding, and that Mr. Forde and myself know where  his hiding-place is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent gave an odd cough. &lsquo;I wonder you ain&rsquo;t  afraid to say this to me, Miss, seeing as I may tell the police.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will,&rsquo; answered Dericka, fixing a  steady gaze on the woman. &lsquo;I said that I could tell you with safety.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got no hold over me,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. Krent  fiercely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I may not have, but another person may be able to  silence you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And that other person, if you please, Miss Trevick?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Josiah Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The colour ebbed from the fat cheeks of the  housekeeper, and she turned as pale as a lily, glancing from one to the other  in a state of scarcely concealed alarm. However, she made a bold attempt to  foil the attack. &lsquo;What has Mr. Polwin to do with me, Miss?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, you can best explain that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent obstinately.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then let me explain,&rsquo; said Forde, seeing what Dericka  meant. &lsquo;As Mr. Polwin, this man is nothing to you, but as Samuel Krent &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The woman rose and flapped her hands helplessly. &lsquo;Oh, what  are you saying &mdash; why do you speak to me like this? My husband is dead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Under the name of Josiah Polwin,&rsquo; said Forde calmly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a lie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is the truth, and you can prove it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde rose, shrugged his shoulders, and slipped the blue  envelope containing the new will into his breast-pocket. &lsquo;Then there&rsquo;s no more  to be said,&rsquo; he remarked blandly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course there ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent, reassured.  &lsquo;Give me back the will and let me go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Forde steadily; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take this up to Mr.  Gratton and see if it&rsquo;s genuine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Genuine!&rsquo; The colour flushed Mrs. Krent&rsquo;s cheeks.  &lsquo;Oh, Lord, sir, you don&rsquo;t think Polwin &mdash; I mean &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You mean Polwin right enough,&rsquo; said Dericka, noticing  the slip, and taking advantage of it at once. &lsquo;Mrs. Krent, we may as well  understand one another before you leave this room.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The big woman sat down with a thump and flapped her  hands like a clumsy [?].</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rsquo; she whimpered.  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s been nothing but trouble since Bowring died. I never did care  for money. Me and Morgan and Jenny can live well enough on the two thousand a  year you promised me, Miss, so you can destroy the will and keep the rest.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Forde sternly. &lsquo;If this will,&rsquo; he tapped  his breast-pocket, &lsquo;is genuine, the money will go to you in trust for Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You would let the money go?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Krent, her  little pig&rsquo;s eyes opening to their widest. Such an action was beyond her system  of ethics, and she collapsed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. Why should Miss Trevick or her father keep money  which does not belong to them?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you said it did, sir?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Half of it, not all. But if the will is genuine then  Morgan will get everything and Sir Hannibal will lose what is rightfully his.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you want me to do, sir?&rsquo; asked the housekeeper  after a pause.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you wish to do yourself?&rsquo; demanded Forde  quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, sir, you and her &mdash; I mean that young lady &mdash;  have been so kind to me when I hadn&rsquo;t that second will, that I&rsquo;m ready to place  myself in your hands. I only want enough to be comfortable, and as this is a  world of wickedness, sir, I hope you&rsquo;ll be my friend and help me out of my many  difficulties.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;About the money, Mrs. Krent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, sir; and there it is,&rsquo; she cried, with a burst  of emotion; &lsquo;as soon as folks know that Morgan is rich they&rsquo;ll come round  trying to get money, and he&rsquo;ll get beyond control. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s hard enough to  manage him as it is, but if he, with his poor wits, thinks he is rich he&rsquo;ll  simply kick over the traces and leave me and my poor girl. I&rsquo;m afraid &mdash; very  much afraid.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent appeared to be genuine, for, so far as she  knew, she possessed the whip hand, yet was willing to be guided by Forde.</p>
  <p>Dericka softened somewhat at this, as she perceived  that the housekeeper was really an honest woman. She therefore went to the door  to be sure that no one was outside, then came back to the chair she occupied  near Mrs. Krent, who by this time was shaking like a jelly. &lsquo;Mrs. Krent, you  husband &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead &mdash; he&rsquo;s dead &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! Listen. Mr. Forde and myself know everything.&rsquo;  And Dericka related all that Jenny had overheard and told. &lsquo;We want to be your  friends,&rsquo; concluded Miss Trevick, &lsquo;and as you have proved that you really have  a good heart, Mr. Forde shall help you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Poor Mrs. Krent sat staring straight in front of her  with two fat hands on her fat knees. When Dericka stopped speaking she heaved a  portentous sigh.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All the help in the world won&rsquo;t do much good against  Samuel, Miss,&rsquo; she said sadly, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a devil.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s law in the land to restrain such devils,&rsquo;  Forde reassured her; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid, Mrs. Krent, he&rsquo;ll not trouble you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you can get him out of my life, sir, I&rsquo;ll go on my  knees,&rsquo; cried the housekeeper vehemently. &lsquo;For the moment I was vexed at Jenny  telling you and betraying her mother, as it were, but now I see that it is the  best thing that she could have done, although it would never have struck me,  fool that I am. But now you know what a devil Polwin is, and that his real name  is not Polwin, perhaps you&rsquo;ll help?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I promise you I will,&rsquo; said the lawyer, soothingly,  &lsquo;but you must be plain with me, Mrs. Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have only to ask and to have, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then tell me, when did you see Polwin last?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No later than today. He came along this morning and  said that Bowring had some papers of his connected with South Africa. I  promised to send them to him and that is what took me to the desk to look. In  looking I found the will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Forde with satisfaction; &lsquo;and was Mr.  Polwin in the house by himself during the morning?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, sir. I wouldn&rsquo;t let him enter. He stood at the  door and talked in his devilish way. Why, sir?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought that he might have hidden this will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lord, sir, why should he do that? If Polwin &mdash; I&rsquo;ll  call him that, for I&rsquo;ll never soil the name I bear by giving it to him,  although it is his own &mdash; but I say, if Polwin had that will and knew that I had  the management of the money he would have kept the will and bothered me to give  him what he wanted. And tons of gold,&rsquo; added Mrs. Krent, fervently, &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t  satisfy that beast.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you thinking of, Oswald?&rsquo; asked Miss  Trevick.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m wondering if Polwin had a finger in this pie. He  might have hid the will in the desk and then sent Mrs. Krent to find it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You fancy that it may be a forgery?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, yes! Of course, I don&rsquo;t know Mr. Bowring&rsquo;s  signature, but &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Bowring&rsquo;s name right enough,&rsquo; said Mrs.  Krent wiping her inflamed face; &lsquo;but I hope it is a forgery. I&rsquo;d rather have  the two thousand a year that young lady promised me and have done with the  whole business. Anything rather than be persecuted by Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Forde, after a pause, &lsquo;I must see Mr.  Gratton, who knows Bowring&rsquo;s writing better than anyone else, and learn if the  will is genuine. I&rsquo;ll get him to come down here and see the two witnesses.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re servants in the house,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent, &lsquo;but  both of them gave notice a week ago. One was a man, and the other a woman, and  they&rsquo;ve got married since leaving the Grange.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Humph! that looks dicky,&rsquo; said Forde, nodding. &lsquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised to find that Polwin had a finger in this pie.&rsquo; He  paused, then turned to Mrs. Krent solemnly: &lsquo;Have you any reason to believe  that your husband shot Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lord save and preserve us!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent aghast,  &lsquo;how can I say, sir? Polwin&rsquo;s fit for anything, but I&rsquo;m bound to say that he  seemed as puzzled as anyone else over the death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you sure?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As sure as I&rsquo;m sitting here wishing that I was a  widow,&rsquo; cried the woman earnestly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a wicked person: live and let live  say I; but if I could put a rope round the neck of that wicked man I&rsquo;d do it,  cost what it might. Oh, Lord!&rsquo;&mdash; Mrs. Krent again placed her hands on her knees  and rocked &mdash;&lsquo;to think of all that money coming to Morgan, who&rsquo;s got no more  sense than a babe of a month old. Polwin would get hold of him, and lead him to  the Pit of Tophet. Mr. Forde, sir,&rsquo; she went on hysterically, &lsquo;put that will in  the fire and let me have the two thousand a year; I&rsquo;ll say nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no, Mrs. Krent! I cannot commit a crime like  that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s worse crimes will be  committed,&rsquo; said the old woman bitterly; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re dealing with Satan himself,  Mr. Forde, mark my words if you ain&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence for a few minutes, while Mrs. Krent  rocked and moaned and shook her head, weeping the while like a very Niobe.  Plainly she was terrified to death by Polwin, alias Krent, and would stick at  nothing to get rid of him.</p>
  <p>But the mystery was far from being unravelled, and to  destroy the second will would only be to make things more complicated.  Therefore Forde made up his mind to see Gratton and ask his opinion. If Sir  Hannibal, or, rather, Dericka, was to lose the sixty thousand a year the loss  would have to be borne. All Forde wished to do at the present moment was to  establish the good name of Sir Hannibal Trevick and save him from the gallows &mdash;  no easy task, owing to the difficulties of the case and the shady doings of the  baronet in South Africa while a member of the firm.</p>
  <p>Oswald felt that he would require time to think out  things, and so spoke on this point to Mrs. Krent:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go home,&rsquo; said he quietly; &lsquo;go home and say nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But if Polwin asks about the will?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If he hid the will he is too clever to do that,&rsquo; said  Forde, quickly; &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll wait until it is proved. Knowing that you would find the  will is contented to bide his time. Of course, I may be wrong about the man &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent rose, shaking her head half-blinded with  tears.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just the sort of thing he&rsquo;d do, sir,&rsquo; she  moaned, &lsquo;and then when the money came to me for Morgan he&rsquo;d ruin that poor lad  and worry me into my grave. Oh, I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue, sir, but will you speak to  Polwin?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said Dericka quickly; &lsquo;that would put him on  his guard. We must be silent until we can see our way. All Mrs. Krent has to do  is to go home and say nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do that, Miss &mdash; I&rsquo;ll be as dumb as a fish. But I  know my health will give way with all this worry. I wish I&rsquo;d the laundry  again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; asked Dericka, &lsquo;did Morgan come home?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, he came home, Miss; I knew that he would. He  takes fits of wandering, but he always comes back. But I&rsquo;ll get back to Jenny  and hope for the best, expecting the worst. I&rsquo;ll not sleep a wink this night.  Oh, why didn&rsquo;t I stick by the laundry and keep a quiet heart? Money don&rsquo;t bring  happiness. Oh, dear me!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>While Mrs. Krent was thus maundering on, Forde had an  idea. It would be just as well, he thought, to see the desk in which the will  had been found. Also, Polwin might come to the Grange on that night, and if  confronted might give himself away. He whispered this to Dericka, who nodded  assent, and then addressed himself to the crying housekeeper.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take you home, Mrs. Krent,&rsquo; said he in a kindly  tone, &lsquo;and if Polwin comes on the scene I&rsquo;ll protect you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you, sir, a thousand times, but if he knows  that you know &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep him in the dark as much as possible, Mrs.  Krent. But if he does learn that we are acquainted with his little games, why  we must beat him, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent moaned and nodded, being too far gone to  argue. She submitted to be led out of the room, and was hoisted into the trap a  mere bundle of clothes. Knowing that Polwin was often at the Dower House, she  shook and quaked at every shadow, and not until she and Forde, with the driver,  were well on the way to the Grange did she recover sufficiently to speak. Then  Forde stopped her, as she spoke too freely for safety, and the driver was all  ears. For all both of them knew, he might be a creature of Polwin&rsquo;s. Therefore  they drove through the night in silence &mdash; and a very bad night it was, cold and  with a gusty wind that almost tore them from their seats when they reached the  high moors. However, Mrs. Krent was too bulky to be easily moved, and Oswald  held on to the woodwork of the trap, so they managed to get along pretty well.  But there was no moon, and the darkness was of the pit.</p>
  <p>Suddenly they heard a rattle of horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and  past them tore a wild steed with a man on its back riding under whip and spur.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Save us,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent hysterically; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s  wrong?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was no reply, and the rattling hoofs of the  horse died away.</p>
  <p>Forde thought that the man was probably on his way for  a doctor, and was one of the dwellers in Penrith&rsquo;s village. This explanation  reassured Mrs. Krent, and she subsided into a kind of doze. On and on they  crawled into the darkness for the horse was not very quick. At last they  rounded the curve and came within view of the ancient Grange nestling amidst  the gloom of the moors.</p>
  <p>But these were not gloomy now. The old house was a  mass of flames, and flared in the windy night, a gorgeous bonfire, telling of  destruction and terror.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>Chapter  XX<br>
    A Terrible Night</b></h2>
  <p>Forde had a hard time to keep Mrs. Krent from throwing  herself out of the trap when she saw the flaming Grange. Screaming out that  Jenny would be burnt to death, that Polwin &mdash; only she used his name of Samuel &mdash;  had fired the house, that she had lost her dear daughter, she strove again and  again to hurl herself to the ground as the horse literally galloped up the  avenue. By main force the young lawyer held her to her seat, and the driver  whipped the animal hard, so as to arrive on the scene of disaster the sooner.  The vehicle rocked from side to side as the maddened animal tore up towards the  blazing mass and stopped short on the brilliantly-illuminated lawn so abruptly  that Mrs. Krent and Forde with her was hurled to the ground.</p>
  <p>The stout woman with wonderful agility picked herself  up, and with outstretched arms ran open-mouthed and gasping towards the burning  house.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jenny; oh, my Jenny, where are you?&rsquo; she panted  wildly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mother! mother!&rsquo; and Jenny, holding Morgan by the  hand, ran out of the crowd of servants and quarrymen and labourers who were  watching the fire. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m all right. The man has gone to St. Ewalds for the  fire-engines.&rsquo; And then Forde recollected the racing horseman.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How did it happen &mdash; how did it happen?&rsquo; yelled Mrs.  Krent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; faltered Jenny, who was white and  trembling. &lsquo;I was getting ready for dinner, and it was quite dark. Then I heard  Morgan crying out that the place was on fire, and met him coming up the  stairs.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes! Yes! Yes!&rsquo; danced the idiot; &lsquo;I saw the red  fire, I saw it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Krent anxiously.</p>
  <p>The man looked at her cunningly and continued to caper  on the fire-lighted lawn. &lsquo;I saw the red fire,&rsquo; he chaunted; &lsquo;I saw it, I saw  it burning &mdash; burning.&rsquo; And not another word could they get out of him.</p>
  <p>In the meantime more and more people were gathered  together in the grounds of the Grange. The mansion, being of granite, could not  burn wholly to the ground, but it was being gutted as fast as possible by the  fierce fire. The high wind still continuing fanned the blaze into roaring  vigour, and sheets of flame stormed the darkness of the sky. From Penrith, from  the quarries, from hamlets and solitary houses flocked the sparse dwellers of  the moorland. Far and near the blaze reddened the gloomy heath, and seabirds  screamed, hovering round the glare, apparently thinking it was a lighthouse on  a gigantic scale.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent stood helplessly on the lawn, wringing her  fat hands.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not a thing will be saved,&rsquo; she sobbed; &lsquo;not a  thing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But everybody, both men and women, and indeed children  were trying their best to carry out articles from the burning house. The lawn  was littered with chairs and tables, and couches, and draperies, and china, and  glass, and pictures, and many other objects too numerous to mention.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent, still sobbing, dropped on to a dainty  Louis Quinze sofa with gilded framework, and sat there bemoaning the loss of  all her worldly belongings. Nothing could be done to stop the flames until the  arrival of the St. Ewalds brigade for there was no means of getting water  rapidly enough on to the flaming mass. It is true that a line of labourers with  buckets had been formed between a moorland stream near at hand and the terrace,  but although the buckets passed rapidly from hand to hand, those who were  trying to put out the fire by this means might as well have used a squirt.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!&rsquo; groaned Mrs. Krent, rocking on  the sofa; &lsquo;I was always afraid of fire. Jenny, you careless girl, why didn&rsquo;t  you see that the lamps and things were safe?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They were all right when I went up to get dressed,  mother.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where did the fire begin?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In the drawing-room, I think. At least, that was in  flames when I came down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The lamp might have upset, Jenny.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where was Morgan while you were dressing?&rsquo; asked  Forde, who was standing by the housekeeper&rsquo;s side regretting the loss of  Dericka&rsquo;s ancestral home.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In the drawing-room,&rsquo; said Jenny with hesitation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then he must have set it on fire,&rsquo; cried Forde  promptly.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent raised her voice to a scream. &lsquo;Morgan! Did  you light the fire?&rsquo; she asked coaxingly; &lsquo;come tell nursey.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I saw it blaze, I saw it red,&rsquo; chaunted the idiot,  waving his hands over his head; &lsquo;it was red, red &mdash; Polwin with the matches; oh,  Polwin with the matches.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent, rising tremulously, &lsquo;that  wretch here? Oh, then I know that he did it &mdash; he did it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is not true, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; and the steward emerged  from the crowd where he had been helping. He looked as meek and respectable as  ever, and Forde found it hard to believe that he was the terrible person Mrs.  Krent asserted him to be. &lsquo;If you want to know the truth, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he continued,  addressing the housekeeper respectfully, &lsquo;it was that young man,&rsquo; and he  pointed to Morgan, who was dancing fantastically to his shadow in the red  light.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How can you tell that?&rsquo; whimpered Mrs. Krent, a bit  reassured when she saw that Polwin had no intention of asserting himself in  public.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I came to see you, ma&rsquo;am&rsquo;&mdash; he cast a side look at  Forde &mdash;&lsquo;with a message from my young mistress, Miss Trevick. I rang and rang,  but no one came to the door, so I went to the window of the drawing-room. I saw  the lamps lighted, and also that young man,&rsquo; he again pointed to Morgan  Bowring, &lsquo;lighting matches and throwing them about. The better part of the room  was already in a blaze. I broke in through the window and snatched the box out  of his hand. That is why he keeps repeating &ldquo;Polwin with the matches&rdquo;. Then I  gave the alarm.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Morgan did that,&rsquo; cried Jenny, shrinking from the  man.</p>
  <p>Polwin turned on her like lightning. &lsquo;Morgan ran up to  tell you of the blaze,&rsquo; said he quietly, with a suspicion of a snarl in his  voice, &lsquo;but I gave the alarm to the servants &mdash; too late, however.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, that is right,&rsquo; said a respectable woman at Mrs.  Krent&rsquo;s elbow. &lsquo;Mr. Polwin came running into the kitchen saying the  drawing-room was afire. We all rushed in, but it was too late.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jane Trubby,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Krent, indignantly, &lsquo;I gave  you notice a few weeks ago. Why aren&rsquo;t you with your wedded husband instead of  coming into the house unbeknown to me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I came with my husband, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Jane  respectfully, and she introduced an elderly, shifty-eyed man, who rubbed his  hands and cringed. At this moment the crash of a floor drew everyone forward,  Mr. and Mrs. Trubby amongst the rest.</p>
  <p>Polwin had slipped back again amidst the crowd and  could be seen urging the bucket bearers to fresh exertions. Forde caught Mrs.  Krent&rsquo;s elbow as she lunged forward.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who are Mr. and Mrs. Trubby?&rsquo; he asked, then,  receiving no reply from the dazed woman, shook her; &lsquo;are they the witnesses to  the will?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent in a kind of parrot-screech and  ramped forward into the thick of the mob.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said Forde to himself, and retiring a step  before the fiery furnace which faced him, &lsquo;the witnesses of the will stand up  for Mr. Polwin. That looks bad. I believe it&rsquo;s forged after all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Unexpectedly, while watching the frantic throng, he  turned and saw Anne Stretton at his elbow. She looked very pale and ill. Beside  her stood the sulky squire of Penrith Manor, who nodded gruffly to the young  barrister.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How are you, Mr. Forde?&rsquo; said Miss Stretton calmly.  &lsquo;This is very terrible, is it not? Can nothing be saved?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I fear not until the brigade arrives,&rsquo; said Forde,  taken aback; &lsquo;but pardon me, Miss Stretton, I thought you were in St. Ewalds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I came to Penrith Manor this evening to dinner and to  stop the night at the request of Mrs. Penrith,&rsquo; said Anne quietly. &lsquo;We saw the  blaze, and came up to see what assistance we could give. Ralph, will you not  help?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to,&rsquo; said the squire sullenly, and loafed  forward with his hands in his pockets. He was in evening dress, and a fine  figure of a man, yet he looked like a veritable yokel as he stumbled into the  midst of the helpers. When he was out of earshot Miss Stretton hurriedly  whispered to the barrister:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I came to see Mrs. Krent on business.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Does she know that Sir Hannibal is hiding &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. That is all safe. Hush! Miss Stretton, don&rsquo;t say  too much, there are eyes and ears everywhere,&rsquo; and he cast a significant look  upon Polwin, who, mean and frowning, was slinking at the edge of the crowd,  casting furtive glances at the pair. &lsquo;Do you see that man? I believe he set  fire to the place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin? I know him; Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s steward. He first  started the rumour that Sir Hannibal was guilty.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I rather think Mrs. Krent did that in her folly.  However we must keep Sir Hannibal where he is until we can prove his  innocence.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have you seen him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, and so has Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He told you everything?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;About what?&rsquo; asked Forde, on his guard.</p>
  <p>Miss Stretton laughed. &lsquo;Oh, you need not be suspicious  of me,&rsquo; said she in an easy manner. &lsquo;Sir Hannibal told me of all his dealing in  Africa with Mr. Bowring and Mr. Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde started. &lsquo;What do you know &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know that Polwin is Krent, masquerading as an  angel. I know about the Death&rsquo;s Head also.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal could not have told you that,&rsquo; cried  Forde suddenly, &lsquo;as he did not know it himself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I learned it from another source,&rsquo; said Anne quickly.  &lsquo;Do you see that man?&rsquo; She pointed to a gigantic figure looming against the  flames. &lsquo;He knows about the Death&rsquo;s Head, and about Polwin also.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Anak.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And Anak led the mob who wished to destroy the Dower  House?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course he did. Now, can you put two and two  together?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; Forde looked quickly into Miss Stretton&rsquo;s  mocking face, &lsquo;then you think that Anak has something to do with Polwin, and  that Polwin is mixed up in this murder?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am quite certain of it,&rsquo; said Anne decisively.  &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; and she sank her voice as the lean figure of Polwin glided close to  them. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she added with a shudder, &lsquo;do you think he overheard?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t care.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; murmured Anne, who again looked uncomfortable.  &lsquo;Polwin is a most dangerous man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He looks meek enough,&rsquo; muttered the barrister.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, in his case appearances are deceptive.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But how do you happen to know his real character?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne Stretton was quite ready with a reply:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sir Hannibal told me a lot, and then I have been  watching Mr. Polwin of late. Of course, you know his real name is &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Krent,&rsquo; finished Oswald; &lsquo;yes, I know. I believe that  Polwin, as he calls himself, is at the bottom of the whole affair.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; assented Miss Stretton; &lsquo;and yet I did not see  him &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; asked Forde when she hesitated.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; replied Anne abruptly. &lsquo;Later on I may  tell you, and may ask for your assistance. I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing now,&rsquo; she  added, bringing her mouth close to his ear, &lsquo;Sir Hannibal must leave that mine.  It is not safe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, who knows where &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; She placed her finger on her lips as Polwin,  in company with Anak, came near and sent stray glances in their direction.  &lsquo;Hark! That must be the fire engine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The interruption came very opportunely, for Polwin  decidedly was suspicious of her conversation with Forde. Why he should be  speaking so earnestly to Anak, with glances towards her, Anne could not think.  But she learned that within a very short space of time. Meanwhile her  attention, and, indeed, that of everyone was taken up with the fire engine and  many traps from St. Ewalds, which dashed up in fine style. A hose was laid on  the stream, the pumps were set to work, and in a few minutes a thick spurt of  water was dashing against the almost red-hot walls of the doomed mansion. For  doomed it was. There seemed to be very little chance of saving the ancestral  home of the Trevicks.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All gone &mdash; all gone!&rsquo; moaned Mrs. Krent, who stood  between Jenny and Morgan holding a hand of each; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m beggared in my old age.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; breathed Forde in her ear, &lsquo;remember the  will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s all very well, sir, but there&rsquo;s things  lost that can&rsquo;t be replaced. Family photographs, and my mother&rsquo;s silver teapot,  to say nothing of Jenny&rsquo;s toys, which I had hoped to keep for her children.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde shuddered at this last remark when he looked on  Morgan, who was dancing and gibbering in his excitement. It would be a sin, he  thought, if Jenny became a mother.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Krent continued to moan and wring her hands,  Morgan to dance, and Jenny to stand like a statue.</p>
  <p>At the edge of the group hovered Polwin, meek and  demure, like an evil shadow. And near him lounged Anak, his eyes fastened,  curiously enough, on Miss Stretton, who, however, seemed oblivious of his  scrutiny.</p>
  <p>Anne had been joined by a portly matron, well muffled  up in furs against the cold of the night. A few words passed between them, and  Anne pointed towards Mrs. Krent. The portly gentlewoman thereupon advanced and  addressed the unfortunate housekeeper:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am Mrs. Penrith, of the Manor,&rsquo; she said in a  dignified but kindly voice, &lsquo;and I wish you, my good woman and your daughter,  to stop for the night, since your own home is burnt.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thank you kindly, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said poor Mrs. Krent, with  her eyes fastened on the flaming mass; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come with pleasure, homeless and  poor as I am. Oh, dear me, what a crash!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The whole of the roof fell in as she spoke, and  millions of sparks soared into the windy blackness. The brigade was doing no  good with its one hose, although each member did his best. The house was  completely gutted, and only the walls were left standing. Between them blazed  and flamed and roared a great mass of fire. With the exception of the few  articles scattered about the lawn, which had been saved earlier, all the  splendours with which John Bowring had filled the house were things of the  past. Oswald could not help regretting the loss of the fine old mansion. And as  for Mrs. Krent, she appeared to move like one in a dream. At a word from Mrs.  Penrith, Jenny led her mother down the avenue. Morgan followed, dancing as  usual.</p>
  <p>Polwin remained behind with Anak. Forde could not help  thinking from the persistent way in which these two haunted the steps of Miss  Stretton that they meant harm to the lady.</p>
  <p>Shortly Ralph Penrith came out of the crowd round the  fire engine, looking dirty and dishevelled with his exertions. But the exercise  had done him good, along with the excitement. He did not look nearly so sulky  as he had done, and appeared to be more amiable.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All&rsquo;s gone,&rsquo; he growled, waving his hand towards the  house; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off to get a whisky and soda. Will you come, Forde?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, thank you. I&rsquo;ll have to be getting back to St.  Ewalds. I came to see Mrs. Krent, but she has gone at your mother&rsquo;s invitation  to the Manor along with her son-inlaw and daughter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All the more reason that you should come,&rsquo; said  Penrith briskly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, do come, Mr. Forde,&rsquo; urged Miss Stretton, and  from the expression on her face he saw that she had an object in asking him.</p>
  <p>While Forde hesitated the rain-clouds, which had  gathered rapidly, discharged themselves of their ever-growing burden. Down came  the rain as the wind died away, and in a few minutes the crowd was drenched.  Consequently it melted rapidly away, since nothing cools the courage and  enthusiasm of people like a good shower. And this was more than a shower, it  was a fierce, tropical downpour, and speedily the blazing mass of the Grange  was hissing savagely as water tried to quench the fire. The brigade gave over  working, put the horses to the engine and rattled away, followed by the many  people who had come out to see the sight. The lawn was rapidly deserted, and  save for the still flickering flames fighting against the steady rain all signs  of anything untoward vanished. Anne shivered and drew her cloak round her  shoulders. She was moving away with Penrith and Forde, when Anak suddenly threw  himself in her way.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried the big man, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got summat to say.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then say it quickly,&rsquo; snarled Penrith, who had a  short temper; &lsquo;we can&rsquo;t stop in the rain all night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk to me, you jack-a-dandy,&rsquo; bellowed  Anak, and the few people remaining drew near to listen, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re as bad as she.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you talking about, man?&rsquo; asked Anne, drawing  herself up.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, you know well enough what I&rsquo;m talking about,&rsquo;  said Anak. &lsquo;I thought Sir Hannibal had killed master, but now I know &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried Forde, looking around for Polwin, who  was nowhere to be seen; &lsquo;are you bringing an accusation against Miss Stretton?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, I am, sir,&rsquo; said Anak, more respectfully, as he  recognised the antagonist who had brought him to his knees, &lsquo;and against Mr.  Penrith, also. They&rsquo;re both in it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Penrith took a step forward with clenched fists. &lsquo;Take  care, Carney.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take care yourself,&rsquo; said Anak, bluffly; &lsquo;I say now,  and I&rsquo;d say it with my dying breath, that you and that lass,&rsquo; he pointed to  Anne, who was standing straight, pale and defiant; &lsquo;yes, you and she killed Mr.  Bowring and laid the blame on Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a damned lie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a damned truth,&rsquo; retorted Anak, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re the  guilty ones. I saw you at the business myself.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXI"></a>Chapter  XXI<br>
    Anne&rsquo;s Defence</b></h2>
  <p>After that amazing accusation there ensued a silence.  The few people who remained stood open-mouthed, looking from Miss Stretton to  Penrith and from him to Anak, the accuser. Forde did not know how much to  believe, and could gather no intelligence at all from the set expression of  Miss Stretton&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>Penrith growled and cursed and swore under his breath,  but he seemed to be somewhat cowed. And in the silence that was deep could be  heard the spluttering of the dying fire and the murmuring drench of the steady  rain.</p>
  <p>But the situation had to ended somehow, and Forde rose  to the occasion since no one else seemed to take the initiative.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t stop here,&rsquo; he said sharply, offering his  arm to the lady; &lsquo;Miss Stretton, you come with me, and we will go to the Manor;  Mr. Penrith can follow, and Carney.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you want me for?&rsquo; asked Anak sulkily, and, as  it seemed to Forde, looked round for a supporter, probably Polwin.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You must give your reasons for bringing this  accusation. And you people,&rsquo; Forde turned to the gaping few, &lsquo;can go home.  Think nothing of what Carney says; it may not be true.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; roared the giant, clenching his fist.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is a lie,&rsquo; growled Penrith again, &lsquo;and,&rsquo; he also  turned to the knot of watchers, &lsquo;if I hear a single word against Miss Stretton  or myself I&rsquo;ll bring the scandal-monger into court. Come along, Forde, we&rsquo;ll  thrash this matter out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Those who remained shook their heads, and, despite  Penrith&rsquo;s threat, went to their several homes to discuss the matter. With Anne,  the barrister took the path to Penrith Manor, and the young squire followed,  with Anak slouching some yards behind him. For some time they walked on in  silence, Anne clutching at Forde&rsquo;s arm with the grip of a woman who is deeply  moved. Presently, and strangely enough in so usually self-possessed a woman,  her lips began to move, and she murmured to herself.</p>
  <p>Forde, wishing to get to the bottom of things, had no  compunction in listening.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I knew it would come to this,&rsquo; murmured Miss Stretton  almost voicelessly, but Forde, keen-eared and observant, overheard.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you talking about the accusation?&rsquo; he asked  softly.</p>
  <p>Anne started.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did I say?&rsquo; she asked. Then, when he told her,  she nodded. &lsquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s just as well that things have come to this pass. I can  now speak out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then there is some truth in what Anak says?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes and no. He saw &mdash; well, I will leave Mr. Penrith  to explain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What has he got to do with it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Much, and yet nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You speak paradoxically.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Everything connected with this murder case in  paradoxical and mysterious, Mr. Forde.&rsquo; She paused and walked on more rapidly,  almost dragging her companion after her, then spoke again. &lsquo;I tell you one  thing, Mr. Forde, when a man is in love he loses all sense of honour.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you speaking of Penrith?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of whom else? The man worships me, and I&mdash; I can&rsquo;t  return his love, unfortunately for him, and for myself, too, perhaps. However,  if I have been weak, I am now strong, and you will know all soon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have been weak seeing how you  helped Sir Hannibal,&rsquo; said Forde quietly; &lsquo;I presume I am right in saying that  you warned him of the warrant and aided him to escape.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. I heard in St. Ewalds that Sir Hannibal was  likely to be arrested, and knowing that he was innocent I wired to him that  there was danger, and I advised him to meet me at Gwynne Station. He came, and  then I took him to the Pengelly mine. He must leave that place of refuge now;  there is a chance of his being found there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who knows about it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anne cast a glance over her shoulder. &lsquo;Mr. Penrith.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How did he find out?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He followed me one day when I went to take food to  Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde turned this matter over in his own mind.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Stretton,&rsquo; said he at length, &lsquo;will you answer  me one question?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, a dozen if you like. What is it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You believe Sir Hannibal to be innocent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet you declared to me that you saw him on the bank  and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And asked money in order to hold my tongue,&rsquo; she  finished rapidly. &lsquo;Quite so, and a nice opinion you must have had of me for, so  to speak, attempting blackmail. But as you will learn shortly, Mr. Forde, I am,  like the devil, not quite as black as I have painted myself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The lawyer heaved a weary sigh. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Stretton shrugged her shoulders as they halted  before the porch of Penrith Manor. &lsquo;I can explain briefly, Mr. Forde. I love  Sir Hannibal with all my heart, and I am sticking at nothing to save him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet you practically accused him &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To you, Mr. Forde, remember &mdash; to no one else, and it  was necessary for me to do so for reasons which you will soon learn.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>At this moment Penrith, who was jealous of their  prolonged conversation, came up behind them and walked into the porch. When the  door was opened he addressed a few words to the servant, then turned to his  three companions. &lsquo;Come into the library,&rsquo; he said softly, &lsquo;we shall be  undisturbed there. No need to let my mother know of what this man says,&rsquo; he  indicated Anak with his chin.</p>
  <p>Forde obeyed in silence, but released his hold of  Anne. She walked into the study through the door held open by her lover and  sank into a chair near the fire, loosening her cloak with an air of weariness.  Anak came in after Forde, heavy-footed, and sullen, taking off his cap with a  degree of breeding scarcely to be expected from so lowly-born a man. Then  Penrith closed the door and faced the quarryman with a dogged look in his eyes  and with his bulldog jaw protruding dangerously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, then, Carney,&rsquo; he said in his heavy voice, which  sounded like that of a bear with a cold, &lsquo;you can explain what you mean by  bringing such an accusation against me and Miss Stretton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m only too glad,&rsquo; retorted Anak, leaning his  huge form against the wall, and looking a fine animal, if somewhat bovine.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One moment before you begin,&rsquo; said Forde, looking up  from his seat; &lsquo;did not Polwin put you up to this?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anak started and looked quite taken aback. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t  see why you should say that, sir,&rsquo; he grumbled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I believe that Polwin overheard what Miss Stretton  was saying to me, Carney, and to get her into trouble made you accuse her at so  very inopportune a moment.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why should Mr. Polwin wish to get the lady into  trouble?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because Mr. Polwin, as you call him, is mixed up in  this matter of the murder, and Miss Stretton &mdash; as Polwin thought from the few  words he caught &mdash; knows more about him than he thinks safe. Polwin, to put it  plainly, wishes to be first in the field with an accusation in case he should  be accused himself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you say, then, Forde, that Polwin killed Mr.  Bowring?&rsquo; asked Penrith.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I say nothing,&rsquo; rejoined the barrister swiftly,  &lsquo;because I am practically in the dark. Let Anak speak. Then Miss Stretton can  explain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is nothing for Miss Stretton to explain,&rsquo;  snarled the squire, and stared at her steadily.</p>
  <p>Anne looked up, her fine face white and drawn. &lsquo;I  shall tell everything I know, Ralph,&rsquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know what will happen if you do?&rsquo; he warned her.</p>
  <p>She bowed her head and turned to Anak. &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; she  said steadily.</p>
  <p>The big quarryman looked sheepish, and his eyes fell  before those of the beautiful woman he threatened. Standing on one leg and then  on the other, he twisted his cap in his hands, turning over a blade of grass in  his mouth, as though he did not quite know how to begin. At length he burst out  unexpectedly:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, it was Mr. Polwin who asked me to speak  out,&rsquo; he declared defiantly. &lsquo;I told Mr. Polwin what I saw, and he told me to  hold my tongue till the time came to be free with my speech. While I was  working at the fire he pointed out the lady and the squire, saying that now the  two were together it would be the best time to say what they had been doing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Forde coldly, &lsquo;and what have they been  doing; murdering John Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no, I can&rsquo;t say that,&rsquo; said Anak gruffly; &lsquo;I only  saw them about the place just before the motor-car arrived.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps you will explain more fully,&rsquo; said Forde  icily. He felt sure that the big man was but the mouthpiece of Polwin, who was  the arch-demon of the whole terrible business.</p>
  <p>Anak gave his blade of grass another turn. &lsquo;I was  working at the quarry on that day,&rsquo; he said heavily, &lsquo;and had to go to mother&rsquo;s  place to get some dynamite I&rsquo;d left behind. I was coming down the path, and a  mist was dropping over the moor. Just a stone-throw from the bank where the  granite mass was I heard a crash &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The mass falling?&rsquo; said Penrith, sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, though I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time. You can  leave it to an old quarryman like me to tell the sound of falling rocks. But I  heard the crash and didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it, thinking it had to do with  the quarry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The place of the fallen mass being in quite the  contrary direction, my good man,&rsquo; said Anne coolly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, Miss, it was misty, and sound does play some  queer tricks on the moors, you know. I mistook the direction of the sound. Then  I saw you, Miss, on the path: you brushed past me, and nearly touched me. You  looked frightened.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you see me also?&rsquo; asked Penrith scoffingly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t &mdash; on the bank, I mean. But I followed  the young lady, wondering what she was doing in the mist, and saw you running  up to the cart on the road. Then she got in with you and you drove away. But  you came back when you heard the shot.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Anne, suddenly looking up, &lsquo;take a note of  that, Mr. Forde. He declares that I upset the granite mass, but apparently does  not think that I fired the shot which really killed Mr. Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say you upset the granite,&rsquo; said Anak  gruffly, &lsquo;but the squire, here, did.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You admitted that I was in the trap,&rsquo; said Penrith  smartly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; rejoined the big man quickly; &lsquo;I said  that you were running up to the cart. You had run down, I take it, just before  the young lady. I believe you did the business.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Penrith shrugged his shoulder and turned to Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, and what do you think of this?&rsquo; he asked  politely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait to hear what Miss Stretton has to say  before giving an opinion,&rsquo; said Oswald equally politely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Stretton has nothing to say,&rsquo; said Penrith  masterfully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, I have,&rsquo; said Anne sharply, &lsquo;and the time  has come to say it, Ralph. Please be silent,&rsquo; she added, waving her hand as he  opened his mouth to speak again. &lsquo;First I will dispose of this accusation of  Carney&rsquo;s.&rsquo; She turned to the quarryman, who was watching her intently. &lsquo;You are  both right and wrong,&rsquo; she said quietly. &lsquo;Mr. Penrith was driving me to this  place to stop the night with his mother; when we rounded the curve beyond where  the murder took place I made him stop the dog-cart as I wished to climb the  path and see your mother. I left Mr. Penrith in the dog-cart and went up alone.  However, the mists came on, and I feared to lose the path, which is not very  clear when you get right on the moor. I therefore changed my mind and came  down. I did so the more willingly as I also heard the crash and thought that  they were blasting at the quarry and that I might get hurt. I did not see you  when I ran down the path, but I quite believe you when you say that I looked  frightened. I was frightened because of what I took for the blasting, but  which, as you say, was the granite mass being upset to smash up the car.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me go on,&rsquo; said Penrith when she stopped for  breath. &lsquo;I let Miss Stretton go alone to Mrs. Carney&rsquo;s as she wished to. But  after a time, seeing the mist was coming on, I thought she might miss her way  or grow afraid. I therefore tied the horse to a tree and went up the path. I  saw her coming down, and ran back to the cart. We then got in after she had  explained, and drove on. We heard the shot not many minutes later, and came  back. Your accusation is all rubbish, Carney. Both Miss Stretton and myself are  innocent; we had no reason to kill Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you hear the crash of granite?&rsquo; asked Forde,  while Anak looked more sheepish than ever at this clear explanation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Penrith, readily enough, &lsquo;but I also  thought it might be some blasting operations. I have often heard similar sounds  when I drove past the quarries. But probably Carney is right. The motor-car of  Bowring must have been seen coming up, since it was not so far behind us. Then  the assassin upset the granite rock in time to smash up Bowring. Failing that,  he pistolled him; and you will observe, Forde,&rsquo; added Penrith sneeringly, &lsquo;that  Mr. Carney, here, quite exonerates me from the shooting.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde bowed and accepted the explanation, which was  perfectly logical and to the point. Then he turned to the quarryman: &lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Carney slouched towards the door. &lsquo;I have nothing more  to say, sir,&rsquo; he said sulkily; &lsquo;I saw what I saw, and they&rsquo;ve explained.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, you can now explain to your friend, Mr.  Polwin,&rsquo; said Forde sharply, &lsquo;and, hark you, Carney, if you really believed  Miss Stretton and Mr. Penrith guilty why did you lead the mob to storm the  Dower House?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought Mr. Penrith upset the granite,&rsquo; said Anak  readily, &lsquo;but that Sir Hannibal had fired the shot.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have no grounds for such belief,&rsquo; said the  barrister coldly; &lsquo;and now you can go. It will be better if you contradict this  accusation to those people at the fire who overheard, else you will get into  trouble.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Anak nodded and hung his head. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve made a fool of  myself,&rsquo; he grunted.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no; Mr. Polwin has made a fool of you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The quarryman looked oddly at Forde as though about to  say something, but finally changed his mind and tramped heavily out of the  room.</p>
  <p>Not until they heard the front door clang behind him  did Penrith speak, and then addressed himself to Anne solicitously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Will you not go to my mother now?&rsquo; he asked with the  air of a protecting lover.</p>
  <p>Anne rose and turned her back on him. &lsquo;Mr. Forde,&rsquo; she  said, very distinctly, &lsquo;you have a trap here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; I told it to come down to the Manor. It is at  the gate.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Will you drive me back to St. Ewalds?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Willingly &mdash; but &mdash;&rsquo; Forde glanced at Penrith much  puzzled.</p>
  <p>That young man looked white and anxious.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anne, what are you going to say?&rsquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am going to tell Mr. Forde what a gallant gentleman  you are. And when I do, I shall leave this house for ever.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Penrith advanced fiercely. &lsquo;You hold your tongue,&rsquo; he  said hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pardon, Mr. Penrith,&rsquo; said Forde, edging between  them, &lsquo;you are hustling Miss Stretton. Please stand back.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In my own house?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In your own house,&rsquo; said Oswald, bland but watchful,  &lsquo;where you should be more polite than in any other place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anne!&rsquo; Penrith turned again to Miss Stretton, and his  voice took on an imploring tone; &lsquo;say nothing. I was mad at the time I spoke.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;At the time you threatened me,&rsquo; she said fiercely.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I threaten you now,&rsquo; he cried savagely; &lsquo;remember,  I know who is in the Pengelly mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; cried Forde rapidly, &lsquo;then hold your tongue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If she holds hers.&rsquo; He pointed to Anne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll speak out at all cost,&rsquo; cried the woman  desperately; &lsquo;I am weary of all this underhanded business, and I must right  myself in Mr. Forde&rsquo;s eyes. Listen!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go on, then,&rsquo; cried Penrith, flinging himself into a  seat and gnawing his moustache; &lsquo;but remember that your lover Sir Hannibal will  be in gaol tomorrow for this.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Better in gaol than at the mercy of such a cur as you,&rsquo;  said Anne gathering her cloak round her fine figure. &lsquo;Look at him, Mr. Forde;  this gallant gentleman says that he loves me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I do, I do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He loves me so greatly,&rsquo; she resumed with scorn,  &lsquo;that he jealously followed me to the Pengelly mine and learned, from  listening, that Sir Hannibal was hidden there. When I returned here this  gallant gentleman declared that if I did not state to you, who had charge of  the case, that I had seen Sir Hannibal on the bank, and demand money to hold my  tongue, that he would denounce his rival.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is this true?&rsquo; asked Forde, turning to the squire.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; admitted Penrith, sulkily. &lsquo;I am hard up. I  want money and I want Anne, there. I could get both by frightening you about  Trevick having been seen on the bank.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And it is not true?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No more true,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton steadily, &lsquo;than it  is that I wanted money to hold my tongue about a thing which I had never seen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then what you said to Carney is true?&rsquo; asked Forde  rejoicing.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite true. I did all that I stated to him, and Mr.  Penrith, as you may have observed, endorsed my story to save his own skin. But  neither he nor I saw Sir Hannibal. He made me say that under a threat of  denouncing Sir Hannibal in order to get money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde looked at Penrith, who still gnawed his moustache,  beaten, silent, and angry. Then he offered his arm to Miss Stretton.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Allow me to conduct you to the trap,&rsquo; he said  ceremoniously.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXII"></a>Chapter  XXII<br>
    The Red Skull</b></h2>
  <p>It will be remembered that the trap of which Forde  spoke really belonged to Mrs. Krent. But the Grange having been burnt down, the  driver was quite willing to return to St. Ewalds with Forde on the promise of a  small sum. He should have obeyed no orders but those of his mistress, but the  fire had demoralised all the domestics of the destroyed house. The man was  waiting patiently enough when Forde, with Anne Stretton on his arm, made his  appearance through the big gates, which were surmounted by the Penrith crest.</p>
  <p>Oswald drew Anne back as she was about to mount the  trap.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wait a bit,&rsquo; he called to the driver. &lsquo;Miss  Stretton,&rsquo; he added in a lower tone, &lsquo;will you go by yourself to St. Ewalds?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. I know this boy who drives, and I am not afraid.  But I thought that you were coming.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo; He brought his mouth close to her ear: &lsquo;Remember  what our friend within threatened about Trevick? The mine will be searched  tomorrow; I must go up and get him away to-night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes. You are wise. But cannot I come also?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. You must think of yourself. Go back with the boy.  I&rsquo;ll return to St. Ewalds and see you tomorrow, when all is safe. Meanwhile you  can tell everything to Miss Trevick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do so in the morning.&rsquo; She paused, reflected,  then whispered, &lsquo;Take Sir Hannibal to Tregeagle shaft, near the sea. He knows  where it is, as we explored it one day when I was out sketching. It is rather a  dangerous mine, as there is every chance that the ocean may break in because  the crust is so thin. But he will be safe there. Ralph will not think of  looking for him in such a place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But if it is dangerous,&rsquo; said Forde hesitating.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All the more reason for Sir Hannibal to go. No one,  Ralph Penrith least of all, will think that he is hidden there. Besides, the  sea has not broken in yet, and he will be safe enough there for a few days  until we can get him out of the country.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; assented the barrister, &lsquo;but tell me,  Miss Stretton, did Penrith really propose this infamous blackmail?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said earnestly; &lsquo;I assure you that he is  desperately hard up. He has made a fool of himself with wasting money, and is breaking  his mother&rsquo;s heart with his behaviour. He will have to sell the Manor, which is  already mortgaged. He knew that the money was left to Sir Hannibal and thought  to get it by the threat he made me use. And you can understand that I  consented, since it was the only chance of saving Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I understand. But why did you let me have so bad an  opinion of you when by telling the truth &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How could I tell the truth when you did not believe  in me and were influenced by Miss Trevick in thinking that I was an  adventuress, Mr. Forde? Now that she is willing that I should marry her father  I feel that I must right myself in your eyes. I don&rsquo;t wonder you thought badly  of me. Ralph&rsquo;s suggestion was infamous, but, as I say, I adopted it to prevent  the worst coming to pass.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;ll beat Mr. Penrith,&rsquo; said Forde  grimly; &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll search the Pengelly mine tomorrow with the police only to find  that his bird has flown. And I can&rsquo;t say, Miss Stretton, how much I respect and  admire you for the noble way in which you are behaving.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, I am in love with Sir Hannibal, remember,&rsquo; said  Anne smiling faintly as Forde stooped in the gloom and kissed her hand; &lsquo;and  now, good-bye, I am quite worn out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No wonder,&rsquo; said Forde, helping her into the trap.  Then he gave the boy a sovereign. &lsquo;Take care of Miss Stretton, William,&rsquo; he  said significantly. &lsquo;Have you a carriage rug? &mdash; ah, yes&rsquo;&mdash; he wrapped it round  Anne carefully. &lsquo;Now, good-bye, Miss Stretton, and remember to tell Miss  Trevick what I told you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anne in a tired voice, and then the trap  drove slowly away into the darkness, leaving Forde wondering how he was to find  a path over the dark moors, and on a desperately wet night, to the Adullam Cave  of the poor fugitive, Sir Hannibal Trevick.</p>
  <p>However, he thought it unwise to linger round the gate  of Penrith Manor, as at any moment the squire, urged by the devil of unrest,  might appear to see if Miss Stretton had really driven into St. Ewalds. But  Oswald thought after some reflection that probably Penrith, to drown his  disappointment and showing up, would indulge in deep drinking. Nevertheless he  walked briskly away from the gate and up the ascending road which led on to the  highway running to St. Ewalds. On coming out with Mrs. Krent he had taken the  precaution of putting on a heavy overcoat, and not having changed for the  evening, was in breeches and gaiters. Therefore he was fairly well prepared to  face a midnight scramble amongst the streaming moors. And it was now quite  twelve o&rsquo;clock, since the fire had taken so long. He remembered that he had  left the Dower House somewhere about five, and as he had not eaten anything  since afternoon tea he felt most uncommonly hungry. However, it would not do to  trouble about that when his future father-inlaw&rsquo;s liberty was at stake. So  Forde, lighting his pipe to assuage the pangs of hunger, took his lonesome  journey up amongst the dark hills. It was quite an adventure.</p>
  <p>It was lucky for Forde that he was not a superstitious  man, for when the rain stopped falling and a rising wind swept the sky  sufficiently for a haggard moon to peer out, the scene around him was weird in  the extreme. He had taken the way he knew best, which was the path by which he  and Dericka had ascended to visit the mine.</p>
  <p>It was a narrow sheep-walk winding deviously amongst  the ferns and grass and bracken. The cold glimmer of the moon revealed  monstrous forms crouched around in the soaking herbage. Forde knew that they  were but stones, yet they looked misshapen and uncanny enough to be gnomes and  kobolds and pixies watching angrily the human being who dared to invade their  domain. A poet would have found much food for reflection in the half-seen, and  perhaps would have been more than a trifle scared. But Oswald, not being  poetical by nature, smoked on steadily and climbed the steep path without  stopping. There is some use in being unimaginative after all.</p>
  <p>Shortly &mdash; at least, Forde thought so as he took no  count of time &mdash; the young man arrived at the cromlech, and saw, dark against  the glimmering sky, the tall, slender column of the chimney. This was the  landmark over the mine, and he knew that he had not far to go. Stumbling and  groping his way &mdash; for a cloud was hiding the moon &mdash; he reached the ruins of the  houses built above the mouth of the mine. Then he stood on the brink of that  dark pit and prepared to descend. It was not a very pleasant thing to do, and  required some courage, for Sir Hannibal, as he had been advised by Dericka,  possessed a revolver with which to protect himself, and would not scruple to use  it. However, for Dericka&rsquo;s sake the venture had to be made, so the young man  placed his feet on the wet rungs of the ladder and slowly dropped into the  velvet darkness. To make sure that he would be recognised, and knowing that no  stranger could possibly be within earshot in such a locality, Forde began to  sing, very much out of tune, but with the best intentions, &lsquo;Home, Sweet Home&rsquo;,  and wished that he was there with all his might. Indeed, when he reached the  first level, where Sir Hannibal was lodged, he stopped to laugh quietly at the  irony of the tune, for that struck him afresh. Then remembering a possible  shock on coming upon a newly-awakened and terrified man, he began to sing  loudly, and the baritone voice boomed heavily along the rabbit burrow which was  called a gallery.</p>
  <p>The signal was successful, for shortly he saw the  usual star which showed that Sir Hannibal had rounded the curve with a candle.  It gleamed like a yellow diamond in the gloom, and Forde shouted as loudly as  did Achilles over the trench to scare the Trojans.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is I, Forde,&rsquo; he cried at the top of his voice;  &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; and then he went stumbling forward towards the gleam,  barking his shins against projections from the walls and knocking his head  against the low, rocky roof. Shortly he stumbled fair on Trevick.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; gasped Sir Hannibal, whose face was  grey with fear; &lsquo;I have been frightened to death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet you might have guessed that I was a friend from  the singing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Someone might have got hold of the signal,&rsquo; said  Trevick, recovering his nerve somewhat, and leading the way to his den, &lsquo;what  are you doing here at this time of the night?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have much to tell you,&rsquo; said Forde, squatting on  the grass bed from which Sir Hannibal had just risen, &lsquo;but first give me some  food, Trevick; I am starved to death.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s some bread and cheese and a flask of whisky.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That will do. Hurrah! I haven&rsquo;t had a bite for  hours,&rsquo; and Forde fell to with an excellent appetite. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fagged to death  scrambling over those moors,&rsquo; he added with his mouth full, &lsquo;and we have a long  journey before us yet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Trevick had lighted a very excellent cigar, but it  dropped from his nerveless fingers as his face paled. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right; don&rsquo;t alarm yourself,&rsquo; said Forde  soothingly; &lsquo;but you&rsquo;ll have to clear out of this place and take refuge in  another mine. Penrith knows where you are, he followed Miss Stretton here, and  threatens to give the show away tomorrow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah! He is my rival, I knew that he would harm me if  he could,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, recovering his cigar, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t quite  understand.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You will shortly. Give me a match, I want to light my  pipe. Oh, I have heaps and heaps of news for you. The Grange is burnt down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; Trevick again started and stared.  &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not at all. It seems that Morgan Bowring was playing  with fire and threw some matches about &mdash; at least, that is Polwin&rsquo;s story.  However, the old house is gone: nothing is left standing but four walls.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Will my misfortunes never end?&rsquo; said Trevick  desperately.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, and soon. The darkest hour is before dawn,  remember. And, after all, Trevick, you have won the love of a really good,  clever woman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you speaking of Miss Stretton?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am. But I&rsquo;d better tell you from the beginning,&rsquo;  and then the young man related the visit of Mrs. Krent about the new will,  detailed how he had come to be present at the fire, and finished with an  account of the interview in Penrith&rsquo;s library.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you think, Trevick?&rsquo; he asked when he had  finished.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal put his hands to his aching head. &lsquo;I am  quite bewildered, Forde. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. But one thing is clear; I  must get away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To the Tregeagle mine, near the shore. Miss Stretton  advises that place,&rsquo; said Oswald rapidly.</p>
  <p>Trevick drew back with a gasp. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous &mdash; the  sea &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; interrupted the other impatiently; &lsquo;all  the safer so far as your liberty is concerned. No one will think you are such a  fool as to hide in so dangerous a place. We must get away before dawn. In the  meantime, with your permission, I&rsquo;ll take a short nap. Wake me about six  o&rsquo;clock and we&rsquo;ll journey to the Land of Goshen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal nodded, and the barrister, who was  dropping with fatigue, threw himself full length on that grassy bed and closed  his eyes. In less than five minutes his snores proclaimed that he was enjoying  a thorough rest.</p>
  <p>Trevick still smoked and sat by the smouldering fire  upon which he had placed some fresh fuel. He thought of the whole miserable  business in which he was involved, and after thinking everything well over he  had to confess that his troubles were of his own making. Had he behaved well in  South Africa he would not have got into Bowring&rsquo;s clutches and thus have become  the prey of the rascally Krent, alias Polwin. Certainly the money had come to him,  but now even that was gone. &lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t believe that the second will is  genuine,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal half aloud, as he watched the dying embers; &lsquo;it  might be, though. Bowring was just the man to sell me in that way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He said something like this to Forde when, some few  hours later, the two, climbing the shaft with bundles on their backs, stole  across the moors in the reddening flush of dawn. The morning was clear, the sun  shining after the rain, and the breaking light revealed the beauty and mystery  of the wide moorlands. Overhead was a steel-hued sky flecked with still clouds,  and eastward broke the glorious dawn like a freshly budding rose. But the two  men had little time to watch the silent workings of Nature, as they wished to  reach the Tregeagle mine by the shore before it grew much later. The quarrymen  rose early to their work, and since they were inspired by Anak to believe Sir  Hannibal guilty, he assuredly would meet with a short shrift from anyone he  might chance upon. The two wayfarers therefore put their best legs foremost and  hurried down to where the ocean gleamed rosy with the dawn-lights.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;About that will,&rsquo; said Trevick, as their feet brushed  away the heavy dew and they dropped steadily shoreward, &lsquo;do you think it is  genuine?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Forde briskly, for he felt much better  after the rest and food. &lsquo;In the first place Polwin has been dodging about the  Grange and might have hidden it: in the second, the two witnesses are  discharged servants who defended him last night, and therefore must be his  instruments; and thirdly, Polwin knows that if Mrs. Krent is made the trustee  for the money he can get what he wants out of her. If she hadn&rsquo;t been made the  trustee I might have thought the will genuine, but a clever man like Bowring  would scarcely have chosen an illiterate woman for such a post. Polwin by  appointing Mrs. Krent, his dearly beloved wife, has shown his hand rather too  plainly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Still,&rsquo; said Trevick doubtfully, &lsquo;it is just the sort  of trick Bowring would have loved to play me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I dare say, and for all I know there may have been a  genuine second will in the house. If so, it is destroyed, and this one will not  stand water. I&rsquo;ll show it to Gratton and take his opinion. You will have the  money after all, Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka has it; I have given it to Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nonsense. Neither I nor Dericka need so much. When  you are cleared of this charge you can come back and marry Miss Stretton and  use the money to re-establish the family.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve such good fortune,&rsquo; sighed the  baronet penitently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Forde, somewhat mercilessly, &lsquo;I quite  agree with you. But I think, Trevick, that you have been punished for your  follies, so I shall say no more. You may depend upon my doing my best to clear  your character in every way. It is my opinion that everything lies with  Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think so also,&rsquo; assented the baronet; &lsquo;if you could  bring Polwin to the Tregeagle mine I might make a bargain with him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde turned suddenly, with an approving look on his  dark face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t a bad idea,&rsquo; he said musingly; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see  what I can do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only don&rsquo;t let Polwin give me away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll have to give himself away first,&rsquo; said the  young man grimly; &lsquo;here we are at the seashore, Trevick. You take the lead and  show me where the mine is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal nodded and went carefully down the  slippery slope to where the black rocks frowned over the clear waters. On the  verge he pointed to a square tower built of rubble, standing about thirty feet  above sea-level.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Behind that is the mouth of the mine,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Forde drew back. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder it is dangerous. Good  heavens, it is on the very verge of the ocean!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is under the ocean itself,&rsquo; said Trevick dryly; &lsquo;a  rich mine, Forde, which had to be abandoned on account of the danger of working  it. However, it will afford me a refuge for a time. Give me that other bundle  and I&rsquo;ll climb down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shall I not come?&rsquo; asked Forde, unslinging the bundle  of food and giving it to his companion.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No; you had better get back before there is a chance  of anyone meeting you, so that no suspicion may be aroused. Good-bye!&rsquo; And  without further words Trevick began to descend towards the grey tower. Forde  watched him for a few minutes, then remembering that precious time was passing,  he briskly turned on his heel and made for the uplands with all haste. Now that  Sir Hannibal was safe and off his hands, at the worst he could say that he had  come out for a morning walk to explain his presence on the moors.</p>
  <p>He had intended to walk straight to St. Ewalds in  order to advise Dericka of her father&rsquo;s safety. But when he passed the quarries  he heard a shout, and shortly Morgan came dancing towards him. The idiot had  apparently been out all night also, as his clothes were damp and covered with  bits of grass and bracken. He was not his usual merry self, for his eyes  gleamed with anger, and he flourished his arms in a threatening manner. Forde  placed himself on his guard when he saw this maniac rushing towards him, but  Morgan&rsquo;s intentions were quite pacific. He came up with a run, and eyed Oswald  earnestly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you at the Manor House?&rsquo; asked the  barrister.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He would lock me up,&rsquo; babbled the idiot fiercely;  &lsquo;yes, I heard it last night. He would part me from Jenny: he would lock me up.  But I know what to do. I have it &mdash; I have it &mdash; I have it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have what?&rsquo; asked Forde wonderingly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come and see &mdash; in Mother Witch&rsquo;s hut.&rsquo; And Morgan  swarmed like a monkey up the steep path which led to Mrs. Carney&rsquo;s abode.</p>
  <p>Oswald followed, as he thought that from Morgan&rsquo;s  babblings he might learn something.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who will lock you up?&rsquo; he asked the poor creature,  &lsquo;not Jenny?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no! But that wicked man mother hates. Polwin &mdash;  oh, yes, Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought that you liked him, Morgan?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did. He was kind to Morgan: he gave Morgan toys,  and gave him drink &mdash; when &mdash; when &mdash;&rsquo; He stopped, and an expression of cunning  overspread his pale face. Then he began to scramble upward again. &lsquo;But by it I  can curse him, and Mother Witch can&rsquo;t do ghostly things while Anak is with her.  But today we will curse Polwin, and then he won&rsquo;t lock me up. No! No! No!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>More convinced than ever that he was on the verge of  discovering something, Forde climbed briskly after the insane man. In a short  space of time he arrived at the small plateau before the humble hut of Mrs.  Carney. The door was open, and into the house Morgan rushed, gibbering like a  baboon. Forde, not knowing what he was about to do, waited outside. There was a  sound of angry, shrill cries within, and then the idiot rushed out, followed by  Anak&rsquo;s mother, terribly angry and using extremely bad language.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;With this we will curse him,&rsquo; cried the idiot,  tossing a red object like a ball into the air, &lsquo;his bones will waste &mdash; his  brain will boil. He&rsquo;ll be struck with evil things, and Morgan will dance and  dance over his grave.&rsquo; He stopped and turned pompously towards the barrister.  &lsquo;I am Herodias&rsquo;s daughter, and this is the head of John the Baptist,&rsquo; he said;  &lsquo;see how I dance,&rsquo; and he began to throw himself about in a mincing way.  Quickening his steps, he grew excited and tossed about rapidly the red round  object which looked like a football. This terrible performance was ended by the  red ball rolling to Forde&rsquo;s feet. Then the young man uttered a cry of  amazement.</p>
  <p>He saw before him the scarlet-hued, silver-crowned  Death&rsquo;s Head of Moolu&rsquo;s son.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXIII"></a>Chapter  XXIII<br>
    Anak&rsquo;s Mother</b></h2>
  <p>Forde stooped to pick up the red skull with mixed  feelings. He wondered how it had come into possession of the idiot, and what  strange thought in the madman&rsquo;s brains led him to believe that Polwin could be  cursed in connection with so weird an object. But as he touched the Death&rsquo;s  Head Morgan flung himself forward, and snatching it from him with a guttural  cry, bounded on to a moderately high rock near the cabin with the leap of a  cat, and sat there nursing the uncanny relic of humanity with a cunning and  dangerous expression. Forde, taken by surprise, stared motionless.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Mrs. Carney, tottering forward and mumbling  as usual, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s fond of that, is Morgan: it&rsquo;s like a doll to a lass.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How did he obtain possession of it?&rsquo; asked the barrister;  &lsquo;it belonged to Polwin &mdash; it is connected with the murder.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin!&rsquo; repeated the old woman, squatting down on  her hams like a savage; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s my son&rsquo;s friend. I&rsquo;ve never set eyes on him  myself, but Hugh likes him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anak, you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My son&rsquo;s name is Hugh, as was his father&rsquo;s before  him,&rsquo; mumbled the crone, &lsquo;though they do call him Anak from the size of him.  Aye, there are giants in these days, though it&rsquo;s after the Flood instead of  before it. Not but what folk are marrying and drinking and sinning now, as they  did then, young sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You remember me, Mrs. Carney?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Aye. You&rsquo;re the young gentleman who knocked down Anak  &mdash; if you will call him so. And clever you are to do that seeing how big he is,  Mr. Forde. Well, well, there are worse sons than Anak, for he keeps his old  mother like a queen, bless him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The idiot still moped and mowed on the rock, fondling  the skull.</p>
  <p>Oswald glanced from him to Mrs. Carney, and from that  unsightly old creature to the miserable hut which she called home. Her notion  of being kept like a queen was indeed sordid, and he wondered how she could  endure so wretched an existence, especially as he discerned in her manner and  speech, that which argued that she had not always occupied so lowly a  condition. Forde involuntarily put a leading question to her:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is your past, Mrs. Carney?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The beldam looked up, and her black eyes, brilliant as  those of a young girl, flashed angrily. Her face was wrinkled and yellow and  not over-clean, her hair was white, her body was bowed, and her brown hands  were like the claws of a bird &mdash; a vulture&rsquo;s for choice. Also her nose and chin  nearly met, and she looked exactly like the bad fairy of a child&rsquo;s book. Yet in  those eyes shone the fierce, free spirit of inextinguishable youth, and Forde  would not have been surprised had she dropped her worn body like a ragged  garment and shone out a nymph of grace. Those eyes should have been set as  jewels in the face of a young and lovely woman. Now they sent out lightnings  towards Forde because of his indiscreet question.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s my past got to do with you, young man?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Oswald shrugged his shoulders. &lsquo;Nothing; only you seem  to have seen better days.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Aye, that I have, but I don&rsquo;t tell you anything about  them,&rsquo; grumbled Mrs. Carney, and then, with the inconsistency of old age, she  at once began to mumble out her life story. At first she spoke almost too  softly for Forde to hear, so he waited until she warmed up before giving her  his entire attention. Lighting his pipe, he sat down on a stone near the door  of the hut and watched the squatting figure of the aged witch &mdash; for witch she  was, if looks went for anything, as they assuredly did in the middle ages when  an old woman was required to be tar-barrelled. Morgan, humming weird songs to  himself, still played fantastically with his gruesome toy, and everywhere the  earth was growing warm and bright under the influence of the newly-risen sun.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Aye, aye!&rsquo; muttered Mrs. Carney, plucking at the  fringe of her ragged skirt. &lsquo;I was pretty once: no girl prettier, but that Trevick  man he made me hate everyone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did he do you wrong?&rsquo; asked Forde softly, so as not  to break the current of her thoughts.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He! No. No one ever did me wrong,&rsquo; cried the old hag,  &lsquo;I was too clever for them all. Sir Hannibal &mdash; drat the man for a false lover &mdash;  he wanted me to run away with him. But I said marriage or nothing; yes, I said  that &mdash; no wrongdoing for the prettiest girl in St. Ewalds, or out of it, for  the matter of that. But he wouldn&rsquo;t. Bless you, those Trevicks think a heap of  themselves, and he looked on me as dirt. On me,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Carney, rising, and  her voice leaping an octave, &lsquo;me, who was a lady&rsquo;s maid, and was well educated  as a companion to gentry. Aye. I knew French at one time, and could play the  piano and paint on velvet, and do things the like of which are never heard of  nowadays. But Trevick left me to go to London, and never came back. Out of  sight, out of mind with him. Oh, deary me.&rsquo; She hid her hands under her apron  and stared at the glimpse of blue sea seen between the rocks, viewing probably  in her mind&rsquo;s eye the golden days of her distant youth.</p>
  <p>Forde made no remark, knowing that she would  recommence the story after a time, and anxious to hear all that she could say  about herself.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; went on the old woman, still gazing at the  ocean, &lsquo;he left me, did Trevick, but I wasn&rsquo;t one to pine away for such as he.  Oh, no, not at all. There were lots of them, and when Miss Gyles &mdash; she that I  was companion to &mdash; got married, I could pick and choose a handsome man as well  as she. And I did. I picked out the ugliest of the bunch. Lord knows why I did  it,&rsquo; muttered the witch, rubbing her beaky nose; &lsquo;he wasn&rsquo;t tall nor  fine-looking, and he wasn&rsquo;t rich. I couldn&rsquo;t get Trevick, but Bowring was  willing to make me his wife, though I never could abear him. Nor Carney either,  for the matter of that. But he got round me in his wheedling way and we were  married. Then he left me to starve,&rsquo; said Mrs. Carney angrily, &lsquo;with Hugh a  babe at the breast.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where did he go?&rsquo; asked Forde idly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lord knows, young man. He disappeared like a drop of  water over five and twenty years ago, if not more, and never have I set eyes on  him since &mdash; no, never.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He may be dead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dead!&rsquo; echoed the hag with a screech; &lsquo;men like  Carney never die, I can tell you, young sir. Good men die, pretty babes die,  strong wenches die, but the devil looks after his own, and Carney was the son  of Old Nick, for all his wheedling and pious talk. Well, he&rsquo;s gone&rsquo;&mdash; she flung  her apron over her head, rocking to and fro in her grief &mdash;&lsquo;and I&rsquo;m left here  like a bare stone on the hillside.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde looked at the grey stone walls of the hut, with  the moss and lichens growing in the cracks; at the thatched roof of dried grass  and fern; at the small window and crazy door, and pitied the pair who dwelt  there. Anak certainly could look after himself, and was strong enough to laugh  at the weather when living in such a tumbledown house, but Mrs. Carney was  frail and looked decidedly ill.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How did you come so low?&rsquo; asked the barrister.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carney tore the apron from her head and looked at  him angrily as she stamped her foot.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Low!&rsquo; she screamed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have you know as I&rsquo;d rather  live here than in a palace. I&rsquo;m free here, and I can work spells and everyone  fears me for a witch.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s rubbish,&rsquo; said Forde easily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, is it?&rsquo;&mdash; she looked at him malignantly &mdash;&lsquo;well,  you&rsquo;ll see. Day and night have I cursed Carney, and he&rsquo;ll surely be drawn back  to me by the spell. Then I&rsquo;ll stab him, and poison him, and crush him, and make  him long for a death that won&rsquo;t come until he has endured the pangs he made me  endure. Oh,&rsquo; she shook her fist impotently at the calm sky, &lsquo;I could tear him  to bits, the beast, the wretch.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What else could I do?&rsquo; inquired Mrs. Carney with a  scowl; &lsquo;I was left without a penny and with a babe. I tried to earn money, but  those who were jealous of me kept me out of employment. Then I took to telling  fortunes, and did a rare trade until the law turned me out of St. Ewalds years  and years ago. I came here to be near the quarries, where Hugh could work, and  I&rsquo;ve lived here, sun and rain, wet and fine, these fifteen and more years.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde rose, and putting his pipe into his pocket,  yawned. It was about time that he started back to St. Ewalds, but before  departing he wished to learn how the skull had come into the possession of the  idiot. As a means of unloosening Mrs. Carney&rsquo;s tongue regarding the doings of  Morgan, with whom she seemed to be so well acquainted, and because he was truly  hungry, he took half a sovereign from his pocket.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you this, Mrs. Carney, for a breakfast.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The witch grabbed it, bit it to see if the gold was  genuine, and laughed as she tied it in a corner of her apron. &lsquo;Ham and eggs,&rsquo;  she said, walking towards the house; &lsquo;Morgan, make a fire.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde sat down again and watched the idiot, who  readily obeyed the command. Morgan left the red skull carefully on the rock,  and rapidly collected sticks and dried moss which he heaped between two stones  on a blackened spot which had evidently been used before for the same purpose. Then  Mrs. Carney made her appearance with a frying-pan and matches. In a few moments  the fire was crackling merrily, and the frying-pan, filled with three eggs and  several slices of bacon, was placed on the glowing mass. Morgan knelt beside it  while Mrs. Carney tottered to and fro, bringing plates and cups and saucers and  a teapot. The idiot thrust sticks into the fire, and clapped his hands with  childish glee as the sparks scattered and the flame flickered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, pretty, pretty!&rsquo; cried Morgan, and his joy put an  idea into the head of Forde.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you set fire to the Grange the other night?&rsquo; he  asked.</p>
  <p>Morgan looked cunning, and his face darkened.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin,&rsquo; he said, and grated his strong, white teeth.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Polwin did?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never said that &mdash; I never said that &mdash; I never said  that. Oh, I hate Polwin, I curse Polwin.&rsquo; He sprang to his feet, leaped for the  skull, and muttered various spells over it with waving arms.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carney, quite unmoved, placed two eggs and some  bacon on a plate and gave it to Forde, along with a cup of tea and a slice of  bread.</p>
  <p>Forde was glad of the hot food, for, strange to say,  now that the sun was well above the horizon, the mists were lowering over the  moorland, dropping even to the roof of the hut. In a wonderfully short space of  time the whole small plateau upon which the hut was built seemed to be in  cloudland. Sea and sky, rock and grass vanished, and Forde found himself  isolated in white, damp vapour, through which could be distinctly seen the  figure of Morgan gesticulating with the skull. Wondering how he was to find his  way down to the high road again, Forde made the best of a bad job, and devoured  the hot food with great relish. It was well worth the half-sovereign.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carney did not seem at all astonished at the  sudden shutting down of the white mists. &lsquo;It happens like this unexpectedly,&rsquo;  she said, squatting to drink a cup of tea. &lsquo;Morgan, child, come and eat.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But the idiot paid no attention, being still taken up  with his skull play, and very gruesome he looked through the veil of vapour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have you known Morgan long?&rsquo; asked Forde while  eating.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Aye, aye!&rsquo; grumbled Mrs. Carney, who seemed to be  enjoying the gossip and sipping her hot tea. &lsquo;Bowring came back from foreign  parts and wished to give me a better house. But I stopped where I was, as  everyone who wants their fortune told, and their friends cursed, knows where to  find me. But he gave me money when he lived at Trevick&rsquo;s place.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s burnt down,&rsquo; said Forde quickly.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Carney shook with malignant laughter. &lsquo;I put a  spell on it,&rsquo; she said spitefully; &lsquo;Trevick treated me badly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Only because he did not marry you,&rsquo; interrupted the  barrister.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And wasn&rsquo;t that enough, young sir? A woman scorned &mdash;  that&rsquo;s what I was and what I am. Well, I put the spell on him, and he&rsquo;s  wandering Lord knows where, but not far from the gallows I&rsquo;m trying to draw him  to. Yes, I am.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo; Forde was startled, and for the first time it  occurred to him that Mrs. Carney might have something to do with the crime. She  peered over the edge of her saucer in an odd way, guessing, from his looks,  what was in his mind.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the law can lay hold of me for,&rsquo; said  Mrs. Carney in her croaking voice; &lsquo;all the same, I laid the spell of trouble  on Trevick, and trouble he had. I&rsquo;ve laid the spell to bring him back to these  moors where he courted me, and when he comes back I hang him &mdash; hang him &mdash; hang  him!&rsquo; and she thumped on the ground.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But he didn&rsquo;t kill Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; was Mrs. Carney&rsquo;s unexpected answer,  and given snappily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then do you know who did?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; she retorted, winking an eye, &lsquo;but don&rsquo;t  you ask questions and you&rsquo;ll be told no lies. Trevick will come back, and  though he hides himself in the bowels of the earth I&rsquo;ll hunt him out to put a  rope round his neck. Aye, that I shall.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde felt nervous. What if this malignant woman  guessed that Sir Hannibal really was hiding, as she put it, in the bowels of  the earth? There would be small chance of the baronet&rsquo;s escape then. But he  remarked how she had obviously declared that she knew who had actually murdered  the millionaire, and cautiously proceeded to question her, hoping to get at the  truth by roundabout means.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How can you find him if he is hidden hereabouts?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How? Why, Morgan, there, can find him. Morgan knows  every mine and hole in the countryside, and has been down them all. Yes, even  down that Tregeagle mine, which may be flooded at any moment.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Oswald laid down his plate, feeling more anxious than  ever, especially as she kept her black eyes fairly on his face. Then she gave  him a clue to her knowledge.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I rise as early as most folk,&rsquo; said Mrs. Carney, &lsquo;and  I gather herbs for drams or love-philters in the dawn.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What! Did you see &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I saw what I saw, and I have only to say to Morgan,  here, &ldquo;Hunt me out Trevick that I may kill him,&rdquo; and Morgan will. Oh, yes, the  lad and I are great friends. His father let him come to me, and many a time  have I sheltered him when his silly wife and her silly mother thought that he  was lying out on the cold ground. Morgan will do what I tell him, you may be  sure.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But if Sir Hannibal is innocent &mdash;&rsquo; stammered Forde,  startled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to me? I hate him because he made a  white-faced minx Lady Trevick instead of me. I can save him, but I won&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;ll  hang as soon as he is found, and Morgan knows all the burrows.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Hearing his name, the idiot leaped again from the rock  and came to the fire with the skull. He dropped this into the blaze, and danced  round it. &lsquo;Curse it, Mother Witch, curse it, and then Polwin will burn and burn  and burn.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why should I curse Polwin, my son&rsquo;s friend?&rsquo; said  Mrs. Carney; &lsquo;he may be a good man, although I&rsquo;ve never set eyes on him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s wicked.&rsquo; Morgan stamped his foot, clenched his  fists and rolled his eyes. &lsquo;He wants to shut me up with wicked people. Last  night I heard him say to Jenny that I had set the house blazing and that I must  be locked up. Oooh! oooh!&rsquo; He flung himself on the ground in a paroxysm of  rage, tearing at the grass and biting it.</p>
  <p>The old woman fished the skull out of the fire. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t  take on so, deary. He can&rsquo;t shut you up; you didn&rsquo;t fire the Grange.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I did &mdash; I did,&rsquo; shouted Morgan, sitting up  considerably dishevelled. &lsquo;Polwin came to the window and gave me matches to  play with. Jenny never would give me matches because I used to strike them to  see the pretty fire. And Polwin said that I could play with them, and I did,  and then &mdash; oh, what a blaze it was!&rsquo; Morgan leaped to his feet clapping his  hands, then suddenly stood stock still.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is this the way to the quarry?&rsquo; asked a quiet voice  from out of the mist, and Forde started to his feet.</p>
  <p>So did Mrs. Carney. She turned grey, and gathered  herself up in a shaky, nervous state. &lsquo;That voice!&rsquo; she murmured, grasping the  skull.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you answer?&rsquo; said the quiet voice in a rasping  tone. &lsquo;I want to see Hugh Carney &mdash; I&rsquo;ve missed the way to the &mdash;&rsquo; Here the  speaker appeared, slowly emerging from the white folds of the mist.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Polwin! Polwin!&rsquo; shrieked Morgan, and leaped for the  door of the hut.</p>
  <p>He stumbled on the threshold and there lay shaking and  sobbing. Mrs. Carney, with the skull poised in her hand like a cricket ball,  looked at the newcomer with the eyes of a Sphinx. And as soon as Polwin&rsquo;s gaze  fell on the old woman he fell back a step and turned to flee. Forde stood  dazed, not knowing what to make of the scene.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have come back, Carney, have you?&rsquo; said the old  woman slowly; &lsquo;I knew the spell would draw you, villain and &mdash; Ah!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin made a dart into the mist. Mrs. Carney, his  long-forsaken wife, flung the skull at him with so sure an aim that it hit him  at the back of the neck. He stumbled and fell, and the next moment she was  tearing at him like a bird of prey. In response to her yell Morgan also fell on  the miserable man and scratched and bit freely. Forde ran to drag the pair off,  but before he could reach them Polwin had flung both aside with desperate  strength and disappeared into the mist.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Kill him, kill him!&rsquo; yelled Mrs. Carney. &lsquo;Beast. Kill  him! Boo! hoo!&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXIV"></a>Chapter  XXIV<br>
    A Thorough Rascal</b></h2>
  <p>With the sound of Mrs. Carney&rsquo;s cries and curses in  his ears Forde ran up the path after the fugitive, choosing at a venture the  direction he had taken. In one moment he was swallowed up by the wet, clinging  mist, which seemed to grow thicker and thicker as he stumbled upwards. It was  imperative that he should catch Polwin, as he had a very shrewd idea that in  Polwin he would find the assassin of Mr. Bowring. But if this was so, the  thought struck him that Mrs. Carney would certainly have denounced the man she  hated so, and from the few words which she had let drop Forde was certain that  the old witch knew the truth. Then, again, he remembered that only this moment  had Mrs. Carney learned that Polwin was her long-lost husband. Therefore, as  she had plainly said to Morgan, there would have been no need to hang a man  against whom she had no grudge.</p>
  <p>Up and up climbed the barrister, keeping his ears  alert for the slightest sound by which to trace the man. He rejoiced that the  chance of bringing Polwin to book had thus come to pass, and hoped that by  forcing the man to confess he would be enabled to save Sir Hannibal&rsquo;s character  and life. And he was certain that Polwin by this time was in deadly fear of his  life, for not only was Forde on his track, but also Mrs. Carney would do her  best to hound on Morgan to kill him, especially since Morgan already hated the  steward. And Morgan Bowring, mad though he was, could be dangerous on account  of that very madness.</p>
  <p>The mist lay very densely on the hillside, and Forde  could not see an inch before him. He was like an insect exploring a ball of  cotton wool. The young man stumbled and fell and scratched his hand with  brambles, and knocked his head against rocks, and mired his clothes by falling  into marshy ground. And all the time, in spite of his vigilance, he could hear  nothing of the man he was hunting. He was about to abandon the chase in despair  when a miracle occurred.</p>
  <p>The mist, it seemed, lay in swaths across the hills  and the moors, and when he had reached a sufficient height he suddenly emerged  into sunshine, with the blue sky overhead. Below lay the white sea of the fog  hiding the valley, but up here, on the hilltop, everything was clear and calm  and bright and warm. The hill, covered with heather and gorse and broom,  bracken and ferns, mixed with long, wiry grasses, thrust itself upward from the  milky mists. It was an island in the surrounding sea of vapour, and Forde felt  even in his excitement that here he was quite isolated from the world. Then in  the yellow radiance of the sun, which was shining strongly behind a lawny veil  far down on the horizon, he saw a dark figure swiftly making for the cromlech  on the hilltop, where, no doubt, there was a hiding-place. Without saying a  word Forde put his will into his muscles and climbed up with wonderful  rapidity.</p>
  <p>Polwin saw him coming, and with a shout leaped  deer-like from stone to stone, nearing his place of refuge with great speed.  But Forde was at his heels, and when the cromlech was a stone-throw away he  nearly touched him.</p>
  <p>Polwin sprang up to the great Druidical monument, past  it, and Forde followed, almost spent, but determined, even if he broke a blood  vessel &mdash; which was not at all unlikely &mdash; to lay hold of the little villain. He  raced past the cromlech and saw Polwin simply falling down the hillside, so out  of breath he was, apparently making again for the friendly veil of the mist.  Then all at once Polwin sat down &mdash; deliberately.</p>
  <p>When the barrister came up with him he was pumped and  purple in the face, yet nevertheless tried to appear cool. Puffing and blowing,  the barrister stood over him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why &mdash; do &mdash; you &mdash; hunt &mdash; me?&rsquo; asked Polwin, panting  heavily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because &mdash; I&mdash; want &mdash; to &mdash; get &mdash; at &mdash; the &mdash; truth,&rsquo;  gasped Forde, and sat down plump beside his captive, as Polwin truly was. &lsquo;Shut  &mdash; up. I&mdash; want &mdash; to &mdash; get &mdash; my &mdash; breath,&rsquo; and again Forde puffed like a grampus.</p>
  <p>For some minutes the two men sat side by side on the  sunny hillside, trying to reduce the fevered beating of their several pulses.</p>
  <p>Below, the mist slept like a lake surrounding the  island of the hill, but in the blue sky they could hear, if not see, a lark  pouring out his song of greeting to the sun, which was now emerging royally  from the veiling fogs of the valley. Neither Morgan nor Mrs. Carney appeared to  break the stillness with cries or curses, and the two men by tacit consent common  to both waited in silence for a few minutes.</p>
  <p>Polwin was the first to get his breath.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why do you hunt me?&rsquo; he asked again, and breathing  more easily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a long story,&rsquo; said Forde, more comfortable;  &lsquo;will you tell it to me or to your wife?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wife! What do you mean? I have no wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Indeed! You have two, Mr. Polwin, alias Mr. Krent,  alias Mr. Carney, and devil knows what alias besides.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The little man did not even change colour &mdash; perhaps he  could not, as his cheeks were already ruddy with the running. But he looked  more meek than ever as he replied:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How can you prove that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Krent can prove it, Mrs. Carney can prove it,  Sir Hannibal Trevick can prove it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t very well see how you can get at the last  witness,&rsquo; said Polwin spitefully.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I dare say you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Forde, watchful of the  man&rsquo;s every action, for he guessed that Polwin was treacherous enough to knife  him; &lsquo;but Sir Hannibal is in these parts and you&rsquo;re coming with me to see him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Trevick here!&rsquo; Polwin&rsquo;s mean face lighted up with  malignant joy; &lsquo;ah, so much the better for the police.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, no, Mr. Polwin&mdash;Krent-Carney. It is you who will  be arrested.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And for what?&rsquo; inquired Polwin in a silky voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For the murder of John Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t prove that,&rsquo; and Polwin chuckled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, I can,&rsquo; said Forde, bluffing, &lsquo;and I can prove  also that you induced Morgan Bowring to set the Grange on fire. Also a charge  of bigamy can be brought against you. Oh, there are plenty of reasons why you  should be lodged in gaol.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And suppose I decline to let myself be captured,&rsquo;  said the man, who was beginning to lose his temper.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are captured,&rsquo; said Forde swiftly, and before  Polwin could see what was coming he flung himself forward. The next moment the  two were rolling down the hillside and disappeared into the mist.</p>
  <p>Then began an uncanny struggle. In the blinding white  vapour they fought silently and viciously. Polwin scratched and bit like a  woman, but Forde, making use of his ju-jitsu knowledge, managed to get the  better of him, and avoided getting hurt. At last with an effort Polwin flung  the young man aside, much in the same way as he had released himself from his  wife, and made an attempt to run. Forde caught him by the ankle, and this time  Polwin tumbled with a snarl, and with a long glittering knife in his hand.  Forde struck at him between the eyes and grasped the wrist which held the  weapon, but the blow missed, and Polwin got him down on his back. Silent, and  savagely smiling, the steward made a jab at the prone man. Forde managed to  swerve aside, and the knife came down flashing into the ground. As it did so  Forde struck aside Polwin&rsquo;s grip and felt the handle of the knife slip warmly  into his own fingers. The steward with a snarl placed his left hand flat on the  ground to tear himself away, and before he could take it up again Forde rolled  over and pinned the hand to the ground. A scream of agony from the wounded man  announced that the knife had gone clean through the back of the hand. Then  Forde, disregarding Polwin&rsquo;s whimpering, slipped from under him, and, still  holding the knife, looked at his antagonist. By reason of that terrible knife  Polwin could not struggle, and writhed there like a pinned cockchafer.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take it out &mdash; take it out,&rsquo; he moaned, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you  everything.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, you treacherous dog,&rsquo; panted Forde, glaring at  him, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll try this game on again with some other weapon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I have nothing &mdash; nothing else on me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde rose slowly and placed his foot on Polwin&rsquo;s  wrist, then carefully went through his pockets, while the steward cursed him  like a prophet. Finding a revolver, he took charge of it, and then, pulling up  the knife, he flung Polwin aside and sat down, pointing the weapon at his head,  the knife, having done its useful work, being under him.</p>
  <p>But there was no more fight in the steward. He bound  up his wounded hand with his handkerchief and sullenly groaned with the pain.  Below, in the mist, they heard the whimper of a human voice, and both men  guessed that Morgan was hunting like a sleuth-hound for his enemy. Polwin for the  first time turned craven.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Morgan Bowring! Don&rsquo;t let him &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>In a flash Forde saw how the land lay. Polwin feared  the madman, and the barrister took advantage of this to get him down to the  Tregeagle mine to face Sir Hannibal.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Morgan,&rsquo; he said deliberately, &lsquo;will kill you as soon  as he sets eyes on you, and I dare say Mrs. Carney has armed him with a pistol  or a knife. It is just the sort of thing she would do. In your condition, Mr.  Polwin&rsquo;&mdash; Forde glanced at the bleeding hand which the man was nursing in agony  &mdash;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be able to fight a madman as you fought me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; pleaded the steward, all his nerve  gone; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of Morgan. He&rsquo;s mad, and lunatics have such strength.  Besides, you would not let him touch me, would you, Mr. Forde?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see  Morgan sticking or shooting you,&rsquo; said Oswald grimly, &lsquo;for you are at the  bottom of all this trouble.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I say yes, yes! You killed Bowring, you put it about  that Trevick was guilty, you fired the Grange, indirectly, of course; and you  are the gentleman who forged that second will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a lie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can prove otherwise. However, I&rsquo;ll give you your  choice: Either you can stay here and I&rsquo;ll send Morgan along to deal with you as  he wants to &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; Polwin uttered a low cry, like a tormented  animal. &lsquo;No, not that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Or else,&rsquo; went on the barrister pitilessly, &lsquo;you must  come with me to the Tregeagle mine to explain your doings to Sir Hannibal.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s there, is he?&rsquo; muttered the steward, getting on  to his feet; &lsquo;if I&rsquo;d known that &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d have put the police on his track?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not? Bowring left him the money, which is  rightfully mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You liar! As if I hadn&rsquo;t heard the truth from Mrs.  Krent &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My wife doesn&rsquo;t know the truth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Krent is not your wife, and Krent is not your  name. You are Hugh Carney, who has committed bigamy, arson, murder and forgery.  A pretty catalogue of crime to place before a jury, sir!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can defend myself,&rsquo; whimpered Polwin, and again  below they heard the low, animal-like cries of the madman hunting for his prey.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a chance of defending yourself to Sir  Hannibal. Get on!&rsquo; And driving Polwin before him like a sheep, Forde went down  the hill. He did not know where he was, but deemed that by walking downward in  any direction he would certainly strike the high road. And once there, he could  get into the path for the Tregeagle mine. Another cry near at hand sent Polwin  away with his captor readily enough. It was strange that so bold and dangerous  a man should be so afraid of an idiot, whom he knew so well. But Morgan was  more than an idiot now. He was a homicidal maniac, and Polwin&rsquo;s threat that he  should be locked up had made him determined to kill Polwin. All the same, Forde  wondered at the abject fear displayed by the villain. The sweat was pouring off  the man&rsquo;s forehead and cheeks as they dropped downwards in the mists, Forde  holding Polwin&rsquo;s arm in case he should escape.</p>
  <p>Down and down they went amongst the briars and bracken  and wet herbage, sometimes stumbling against a fence, or dropping into a ditch,  or crashing against a huge granite stone. Finally, after half an hour, the  mists grew thinner, and they came upon the high road. Across this the barrister  guided his captive, and made him enter the stony track which led down to the  grey tower of the Tregeagle mine. The air was quite clear here, but the band of  mist still stretched between the sun and the earth. Above was fine weather, and  below everything could be clearly seen, but the bank of mist stretched along  the moors like a white cloud. And in that mist probably Morgan Bowring, hounded  on by Mrs. Carney as one of the furies, was hunting.</p>
  <p>Just as they dipped into the watercourse which did  duty for a road to the mine a man came running up quickly in a lumbering way.  He was Anak, who had emerged as they crossed the road from the quarries, which  were close at hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rsquo; shouted the big man.</p>
  <p>Polwin&rsquo;s eyes glittered, and he gave a wrench, as if  to get away. But the next instant a revolver was at his ear and the barrister  was speaking softly and rapidly:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Make Anak go with us to the mine, you dog,&rsquo; said  Oswald savagely, &lsquo;or I&rsquo;ll blow your brains out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; muttered Polwin, &lsquo;only don&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m  his father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he know?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. He might kill me else. His devil of a mother has  made him hate me. See, here he comes running up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you doing with Mr. Polwin?&rsquo; asked Anak  threatening; &lsquo;he is a friend of mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He is more than a friend, he is your father,&rsquo; said  Forde quickly.</p>
  <p>Polwin gave a cry and tried to get away, but the  barrister held fast to his shoulder, and he winced with the pain of his wounded  hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried Anak fiercely, &lsquo;are you my father, who  deserted &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shut up,&rsquo; interrupted Forde sternly, &lsquo;and come with  me to the Tregeagle mine, Carney. This man has to render an account of his  actions.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To me,&rsquo; cried Anak; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll kill him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There has been too much killing,&rsquo; said Forde, forcing  the steward down the watercourse, &lsquo;he has to explain himself to Trevick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To Sir Hannibal? Is he in the Tregeagle &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hold your tongue, Carney,&rsquo; cried the barrister  imperiously, &lsquo;and come with me. You have cherished wrong feelings against Sir  Hannibal, as you will learn. All will be explained.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Polwin with a significant look at his son;  &lsquo;all will be explained.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The big man changed colour and seemed to be somewhat  dazed over the sudden discovery which the barrister had thrust upon him. They  were still near the high road, and Polwin would have begun to argue in the hope  of escaping. At that moment down the bank and out of the mist came Morgan in  full cry. He carried an axe in his hand and leaped across the road with a  bellow of rage when he saw the steward.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Stop him!&rsquo; cried Polwin, with a scream like that of a  woman, and went tearing down the road to the mine dragging Forde after him at  top speed. He was terrified for his life, and no wonder. Morgan, with his  glittering eyes and disordered raiment and axe, looked anything but a safe man  to tackle.</p>
  <p>But Anak, although he could not guess what all this  was about, opened his mighty arms, and into them ran the madman, blind with  rage. Leaving the two to struggle together, Polwin and Forde raced on and came  to the slippery black rocks over the grey rubble tower. Down went the steward,  scrambling like a cat. Oswald allowed him to go by himself, as he saw that the  man, crazy with terror, certainly would seek shelter in the mine as the lesser  of two evils.</p>
  <p>Forde, holding on to the tough grass, went over the  black rocks also, and in a wonderfully short space of time the pair were  standing under the shadow of the tower.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know the mine! Come along!&rsquo; gasped the steward,  hurrying round the corner amongst the fallen stones; &lsquo;follow, follow!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde did so, when unexpectedly the steward rolled on  to the rocks and would have slipped over to certain death but that the  barrister caught him back in time. Polwin was gnashing his teeth with pain and  weakness, for with his wounded hand and loss of blood and mad haste scrambling  down the cliffs he was about spent.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here!&rsquo; he said, setting his teeth and stripping off  his coat, &lsquo;tie your handkerchief tightly round my arm or I&rsquo;ll lose too much  blood.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The barrister saw the necessity of this, since the  man&rsquo;s bandaged hand was covered with blood. He bound his handkerchief tightly  as a ligature round Polwin&rsquo;s left arm above the elbow, and then assisted him to  put on his coat. All the time Polwin, still terror-struck, kept glancing at the  cliffs, expecting every moment to see Morgan with the axe.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s get down,&rsquo; he muttered, running towards a  gaping hole. &lsquo;This is one way, and the most difficult, into the mine. The other  slopes upward &mdash; the gallery, I mean &mdash; to within ten feet of the perpendicular  shaft; this is straight all the way down. Look!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Forde, suspecting that the treacherous  little man would push him over; &lsquo;you go first.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin, with a look of baffled hate, did so, and  considering his almost useless left hand, and pain and a certain amount of  weakness, he went downward at a perfectly miraculous rate of speed. The thought  of Morgan lent fictitious strength to his muscles, for no ordinary man in such  a condition could have reached the bottom of that dangerous shaft without being  smashed. As Forde himself followed he wondered how it would be possible to get  up again.</p>
  <p>The ladder had vanished, and the two went down holding  on by decayed beams and projecting stones and obtaining precarious foothold  where the crumbling of the sides had left niches. Silent and determined, they  dropped down and down, until the blue sky was but a radiant speck at the end of  a long tube.</p>
  <p>Finally they alighted, so to speak, on the earth of  the first level, which ran directly towards and under the ocean. Polwin,  strangely enough, seemed to know the way well, and plunged forward unhesitatingly.  But he did not get ahead of the barrister, who thought that it was time to put  a check on this too great freedom. Seizing the man&rsquo;s arm, he readjusted the  useful revolver to his ear.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know what you&rsquo;ll get if you try to escape?&rsquo; he  breathed hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; snapped Polwin, dragging forward;  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going in here only to willingly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To escape Morgan Bowring?&rsquo; sneered Oswald  contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And to settle accounts with Trevick,&rsquo; retorted the  other.</p>
  <p>There was evidently some devilment in the man&rsquo;s mind,  but not seeing what mischief he could do with a revolver at his ear, Forde  permitted him, under restraint, to lead the way.</p>
  <p>On and on they crawled in those nightmare regions, the  steward apparently seeing in the dark like a cat. At all events, he never  mistook the way or stumbled, and Forde, by holding on, got forward fairly well.  Then he bethought himself of the signal and sang &lsquo;Home, Sweet Home&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>Hardly had he got through a couple of lines when he  heard a shout. A light appeared, then another, then a third, and the two men  hurried towards this unexpected illumination.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here &mdash; over here, Forde,&rsquo; cried Sir Hannibal loudly.</p>
  <p>Still gripping his prisoner, the barrister stumbled  onward, and when he came within the circle of triple lights, found himself  facing not only Trevick, but Dericka and Miss Anne Stretton.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXV"></a>Chapter  XXV<br>
    Disaster</b></h2>
  <p>The amazement of Forde at beholding the ladies was  only equalled by the surprise of Sir Hannibal when he saw Polwin sullenly  standing in the grip of the barrister.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How did you come here?&rsquo; he asked with nervous haste;  &lsquo;what do you want of me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ask Mr. Forde that,&rsquo; whined the steward in a fawning  manner, belied by the ferocious glitter of his usually meek eyes; &lsquo;he made me  come.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Trevick faced round. &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; he asked the young man  apprehensively.</p>
  <p>Forde did not reply immediately to the question.  Forcing Polwin to his knees, he stood over him with the revolver, ready to fire  should the man attempt to escape.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Keep still,&rsquo; said Oswald as the steward snapped and  snarled like the mongrel dog he was. &lsquo;You want to settle accounts with Sir  Hannibal; here he is, settle them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Trevick&rsquo;s knees shook under him, and he would have  fallen but that Anne put her arm within his. Dericka was the first person to  break a somewhat oppressive silence:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you bring this man here, Oswald?&rsquo; she asked  sharply.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll explain, and so will he,&rsquo; said the barrister,  &lsquo;but first tell me how you come to be in the mine with Miss Stretton?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I brought her early this morning,&rsquo; said Anne quickly.  &lsquo;When I reached St. Ewalds last night I went at once to the Dower House and  found Miss Trevick waiting up for her father. I explained, and she came on this  morning with me to see what could be done.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But that awful shaft, how did you get down?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We came by the other,&rsquo; explained Dericka swiftly; &lsquo;it  is only a little distance away from this very spot.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But it is so difficult to get down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Trevick, trying to appear cool; &lsquo;the other  shaft is both difficult and dangerous, but the one these girls came by is easy.  A ten-foot ladder took them down to a slope which descends to this level. Miss  Stretton and myself found this easy way one day when we explored the mine.  There is no difficulty in getting either out or in, Forde. But if you &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then I hope Morgan won&rsquo;t come that way,&rsquo; said Oswald  to himself.</p>
  <p>Dericka overheard. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Carney told me that Morgan knows all the mines  of this district, and therefore he must be aware of this second way, and will  come by that probably,&rsquo; and he looked at the sullen Polwin, who shuddered with  apprehension.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why should Morgan come at all?&rsquo; asked Anne quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because he overheard Polwin, here, say last night to  Mrs. Krent that he ought to be locked up for setting the Grange on fire. Morgan  is terrified at the idea, and is mad enough to kill this man if he can get at  him. We left him on the high road struggling with Anak, but if he escapes he  will certainly come here, and then &mdash;&rsquo; Forde looked at Polwin again.</p>
  <p>That individual spoke harshly and to the point. &lsquo;In  that case you had better let me settle accounts with Sir Hannibal, as you say,  and then I can hide myself in the recesses of the mine before that madman  arrives.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you afraid of him?&rsquo; asked Dericka with contempt.</p>
  <p>Polwin raised his wounded hand. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t fight against  a lunatic with an axe, hampered by this wound,&rsquo; he said coolly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who hurt you, Polwin?&rsquo; asked Trevick anxiously.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said Forde readily, &lsquo;but not before he had  tried to stab me. Also,&rsquo; he flourished the revolver, &lsquo;this weapon belongs to  our friend. I took it from him and intend to use it against him unless he  explains how he killed Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried all three in a breath; &lsquo;did &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I did not,&rsquo; said Polwin loudly, and would have  struggled to his feet but that Forde&rsquo;s hand on his shoulder kept him on his  knees.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You did,&rsquo; said the barrister sternly; &lsquo;Mrs. Carney &mdash;  your wife &mdash; hinted as much, and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; interrupted Sir Hannibal, &lsquo;is Mrs. Carney aware  of &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Forde interrupted in his turn. &lsquo;I believe she knows  everything, and only held her tongue because she did not know until an hour or  two ago that Polwin was her husband. But you knew it, Trevick?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, unsteadily, &lsquo;I knew it, but  I was forced to hold my tongue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll hold it still,&rsquo; threatened the steward,  &lsquo;else it will be the worse for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There can be nothing worse than this, Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, yes; the gallows.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hold your tongue, you beast,&rsquo; said Oswald, giving him  a shake as Dericka uttered a faint shriek; &lsquo;now, then, tell the truth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It won&rsquo;t be what you expect,&rsquo; snapped the steward; &lsquo;I  did not kill Bowring, though I had every reason to do so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then who is the criminal?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If I tell you and can prove the guilt will you let me  go?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. You will only run into Morgan&rsquo;s arms, and if he  kills you so much the better, you grey rat.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said Anne Stretton, who had been listening  intently, &lsquo;that it will be best for Sir Hannibal to tell us of his relations to  this man Polwin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;His real name is Carney,&rsquo; said the baronet readily.  &lsquo;I knew him and Bowring when we were boys together. We met again in Africa, and  there we formed a firm to buy diamonds. This man,&rsquo; he pointed to the heap at  Forde&rsquo;s feet, &lsquo;cheated both Bowring and myself, so we kicked him out of the  firm.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I went on my own accord,&rsquo; said Polwin, &lsquo;leaving you  and Bowring to swindle.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You were kicked out by Bowring for trying to  blackmail him in connection with those forged bills.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And they were forged?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that,&rsquo; retorted Trevick quickly.  &lsquo;Bowring forged my name to do a deal and intended to swindle me; I said that I  had signed the bills so that you should not make trouble. Then you went away  and spread the report that Bowring killed Moolu&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You ought to have been glad of that,&rsquo; sneered the  steward, &lsquo;since you were the murderer.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rsquo; said Dericka, who was leaning  against the wall.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thank you, my dear,&rsquo; said her father mildly. &lsquo;No, I  was quite innocent. But this scoundrel spread a report about me also, and in  order not to come into collision with the colonial authorities I was forced to  return to England. Bowring, left behind, saw a chance of cheating me.  Consequently, when he returned some years later to England he was a millionaire  while I was comparatively poor. However, when I threatened him he agreed to  take the Grange and to leave me his money &mdash; or, rather, my share of it &mdash; by  will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He gave you all,&rsquo; said Polwin sulkily, &lsquo;and a third  of it was mine by the terms of our partnership.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You were not a partner then, Polwin; we had kicked  you out. And the money was left on condition that Dericka married Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have not fulfilled that condition.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I could not. In the first place it was not laid down  in the will and I could have evaded it; in the second Mrs. Krent &mdash; your wife &mdash;  said that Morgan had already married Jenny.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Carney is the man&rsquo;s wife,&rsquo; said Forde quickly.  &lsquo;Mrs. Krent is really Mrs. Ward.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, I know that, Forde, and have known it all along,  but this man made me hold my tongue, since he threatened to tell of my doings  in South Africa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your swindling,&rsquo; snapped Polwin triumphantly, &lsquo;and  when I go free I&rsquo;ll tell how you smuggled diamonds.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was led into bad ways by you and Bowring,&rsquo; said Sir  Hannibal in an angry tone; &lsquo;all the business of the firm was shady. I don&rsquo;t  attempt to exculpate myself, Polwin, but Heaven knows that I have paid for my  folly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all over now, dear,&rsquo; whispered Anne softly; &lsquo;say  no more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, I will,&rsquo; declared Sir Hannibal; &lsquo;it is only  right, Anne, that you should know the kind of man you have promised to marry.  What our firm did in Africa won&rsquo;t bear the light of day. I don&rsquo;t think we were  ever criminal, but we certainly sailed very near the wind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not a criminal!&rsquo; scoffed the steward; &lsquo;what about the  murder of that Zulu for the big diamond you sold?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bowring killed him, as you well know,&rsquo; said Trevick  immediately, &lsquo;and Moolu knew also. It was Bowring that he threatened with the  red skull, not me. But you chose to place the blame on me also for your own  ends. However, there will be an end to all this. When I leave this mine I&rsquo;ll  give myself up and face the worst. I have sinned &mdash;; it is only right that I  should be punished.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When you leave this mine,&rsquo; said Forde determinedly,  &lsquo;you will know who killed Bowring and thus be absolutely free.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And a pauper,&rsquo; cried Polwin; &lsquo;what about that second  will?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A forgery by you,&rsquo; said the barrister quickly. &lsquo;I  have the will in my pocket at this moment. You got into the Grange and placed  it in the desk and sent Mrs. Krent there to look therein for something on the chance  that she would find it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a true will.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is not. However, I&rsquo;ll see Mr. and Mrs. Trubby, who  are your witnesses, and we&rsquo;ll soon see.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; whined the steward, seeing himself  thwarted at every turn, &lsquo;if I put things right will you give me five thousand a  year and get me safely out of England?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal quickly, but Forde stopped  him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the barrister, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll tell the truth about  the will and the murder now, or else I&rsquo;ll hand you over to Morgan.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go and get him, then,&rsquo; said Polwin impudently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka,&rsquo; said Oswald calmly, &lsquo;go up to the ten-foot  ladder and ascend. I dare say you&rsquo;ll see Morgan and Anak on the cliffs. Go and  &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; cried Polwin, rising with a shudder when he  saw the girl move up the sloping way, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll say what you like.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell the truth, then.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know the truth,&rsquo; said Miss Stretton; &lsquo;this man made  Sir Hannibal hire him as steward with the intention of blackmailing him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He has done so,&rsquo; said Trevick despairingly, &lsquo;and now  &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Anne, &lsquo;he will do so no longer. You  have suffered much, but peace is coming at last.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;With you as my dear wife,&rsquo; whispered the baronet.</p>
  <p>Dericka shivered in the semi-darkness as she heard the  grating and rolling of the pebbles on the ocean bed overhead.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are we going to stop here all day?&rsquo; she asked  imperiously; &lsquo;why not take this man out of the mine, and then &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, no! I am afraid of Morgan,&rsquo; cried the steward  grasping Forde&rsquo;s arm convulsively. &lsquo;Let me tell you all I know and then I can  hide.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Morgan knows the mine as well as you do,&rsquo; said Forde,  shaking himself free; &lsquo;you cannot escape him if he gets down here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, but I can,&rsquo; said Polwin cunningly; &lsquo;if I die, he  dies also, and I don&rsquo;t mind going in company,&rsquo; he sneered.</p>
  <p>His livid face in the dim light was terrible, and the  two women shivered at its malignity. Anxious to end the scene Forde shook the  steward. &lsquo;Tell everything from the beginning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is no need,&rsquo; whimpered the man, sitting down  and nursing his hand, which must have been very painful. &lsquo;You know all about  Africa, although Trevick hasn&rsquo;t told you half the wicked things we did.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You did,&rsquo; corrected Sir Hannibal; &lsquo;you and Bowring. I  want to know nothing save why you killed Bowring.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; contradicted Polwin sullenly, &lsquo;although I  wanted to.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bowring kicked me out of the firm. He made the money  and cheated me, as he did you, Trevick. I don&rsquo;t see why you should be so very  tender about his death. You would have killed him yourself: you said so in the  library at the Dower House.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you know that?&rsquo; asked Dericka quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Miss Warry told me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;When?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Just after Trevick and Bowring came out of the  library.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal suddenly, &lsquo;and then you placed  the red skull in the fortune-telling tent?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. Miss Warry by telling me about the quarrel gave  me an idea. When in Africa I fell in with Moolu, who was wild because he  thought that you killed his son. He boiled down his son&rsquo;s head and dyed it red  and crowned it with silver, intending to work spells with it on you so that you  might be miserable.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; said Trevick with contempt; &lsquo;and why didn&rsquo;t  he?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I saved you,&rsquo; said the steward quickly; &lsquo;I  told Moolu that Bowring was guilty. Then Moolu sent a warning to Bowring that  he would behold the skull of his victim, and that every time he saw it he would  be in danger of death. On the third occasion he would surely die. Bowring was  frightened and suffered like the devil.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And how did the skull come into your possession?&rsquo;  asked Anne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Moolu gave it to me with a sum of money, and told me  whenever I could to place it in Bowring&rsquo;s room or office, or anywhere he could  see it. I did so twice, and on each occasion Moolu managed to get Bowring shot  at and stabbed slightly. I can tell you Bowring was in a great funk,&rsquo; added  Polwin chuckling; &lsquo;he started at every shadow, and did not dare to call his  soul his own, owing to the suspense.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a brute you were to lend yourself to such a  thing,&rsquo; said Dericka.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was paid for it,&rsquo; retorted Polwin with barefaced  impudence, &lsquo;and I hated Bowring because he swindled me out of the money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said Forde, disgusted with the man&rsquo;s manner;  &lsquo;when you put the skull in the tent you told Miss Warry what it meant?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, and I told her to prophesy that Bowring would  die before he reached home.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then you did kill him?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I did not.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There is one flaw in your story, Mr. Polwin,&rsquo; said  Forde after a moment&rsquo;s reflection; &lsquo;how came you to be in the house and able to  deal with the skull when Sir Hannibal met you miles away, near the scene of the  murder?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was not there,&rsquo; said Polwin quickly, &lsquo;I was on the  other side of the hill.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;True, but you had just to climb the hill in order to  get to the scene and upset the stone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so, but I never upset the stone. As to being in  the vicinity, that is quite true. But I had a motor-bicycle as well as  Trevick.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never knew that,&rsquo; said the baronet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; sneered Polwin. &lsquo;I kept that  dark because it was necessary for me to get about the country rapidly and yet  appear to be unable to do so. When anyone saw me on the machine I told him or  her that it was yours. When you came towards me on your own I hid mine behind a  stone, and then went on to Penrith Manor with that letter on yours.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why did you leave the Dower House after placing  the skull in the tent?&rsquo; asked Forde, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To fulfil Miss Warry&rsquo;s prophecy,&rsquo; said Polwin  brutally. &lsquo;I never thought that Sir Hannibal would follow; but chance would  have it so, and that was all the better for my schemes of entangling Trevick in  the death business. I wanted to kill Bowring, knowing that he had left the  money to Trevick!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who told you that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Bowring himself, as he guessed that I might try to  kill him. He made a mistake telling me so much, as only when I knew that the  money would go to you, Trevick, did I determine to get rid of Bowring. Our  mutual friend, the millionaire,&rsquo; sneered the steward, &lsquo;was a great fool at  times in spite of his clever head for making money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, &lsquo;it seems to me that  you did intend to kill Bowring, and managed to do so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. When you threatened him in the library with death  Miss Warry told me. I made her promise to prophesy Bowring&rsquo;s death, and then  put the skull into the tent to warn him that he would die. Afterwards I took my  motor, which I kept down the town, and went out to the quarries. I saw Anak,  over whom I had great influence.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In what way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anak, as Bowring&rsquo;s foreman, had embezzled some of the  moneys with which he had to pay wages,&rsquo; said Polwin calmly. &lsquo;He did not know  that he was my son, and I did not dare to tell him, as I didn&rsquo;t want that old  witch on my tracks. As Polwin I kept out of her sight, and she never would have  set eyes on my but for that cursed mischance of my losing my way in the mist  this morning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said Forde impatiently, &lsquo;go on about  Anak.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I got hold of him and told him to upset the granite  mass into the road after Penrith and Miss Stretton had passed so as to smash up  Bowring&rsquo;s car. When he went to his post I returned along the second road and  met Sir Hannibal. Then, as I said, I concealed my own machine and went to  Penrith Manor on his. Meanwhile Anak waited until he saw the motor of Bowring  in sight, and then, placing a lever under the mass of granite, upset it on to  the road.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah! Then he was returning to the quarry when I met  him?&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite so. The work being done, there was no need for  him to stop on the spot. You heard the crash, Miss Stretton: had you waited you  would have heard the motor smash.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You beast!&rsquo; said Forde with horror, &lsquo;you did intend  to kill the man?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I admitted that I did,&rsquo; said Polwin impatiently, &lsquo;but  the man was only stunned. The shot killed him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And who fired the shot?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin drew himself up and looked round with a  chuckle. &lsquo;Ah, now you must be prepared for a surprise,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Anak told me  later who did that, for Anak went back to see the smash, instead of remaining  at the quarries as I instructed him to do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes. But who fired the shot? Who killed  Bowring?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;His own son,&rsquo; said Polwin calmly, &lsquo;Morgan!&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXVI"></a>Chapter  XXVI<br>
    The Deluge</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;That is impossible,&rsquo; said Forde decisively, while Sir  Hannibal stared at the steward as though he had horns growing out of his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It is the truth,&rsquo; asserted Polwin with a weary look;  &lsquo;why will you not believe me when I tell you the truth? Anak confessed to me  that Morgan was at the quarries on that day, and had a revolver on him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where did a lunatic get such a dangerous weapon?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I gave it to him,&rsquo; said Polwin calmly. &lsquo;Bowring, who  was sick of his son&rsquo;s vagaries, threatened to lock him up. Morgan, who was  always terrified at such an idea, told me. I frightened him still more with  tales of how lunatics were treated.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lying tales,&rsquo; said Forde, frowning, &lsquo;since lunatics  are treated with every care. You beast.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I had to get Morgan into a proper frame of mind to  kill Bowring, as I thought it would save trouble. He had the revolver for quite  a month, yet never used it. But he was always afraid lest he should be suddenly  seized and taken to an asylum. On that day at the quarries he told Anak and  Anak said that he could come with him and see his father killed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; cried Dericka, shuddering, &lsquo;have these men any  feelings!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, bother!&rsquo; said the steward; &lsquo;you make me tired.  Let me finish the story, as I&rsquo;m sick of all this. Well, then, Morgan saw the  smash of the motor as he remained behind when Anak went back to the quarries.  Seeing his father rise, he saw that he was not dead, so he leaped down the bank  and shot him. Then he ran up and found that Anak had come back. Anak took the  revolver from him and told him to be silent, lest he should be hanged. That&rsquo;s  all!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And quite enough,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, who was very  pale, &lsquo;does Mrs. Krent know of this?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No; nor does young Mrs. Bowring. But I believe Mother  Witch, as Morgan calls her, my precious first wife, knows. She held her peace  for Morgan&rsquo;s sake. But now that she knows I am her husband she will go to the  police and tell the truth. I must get out of the country. But of one thing you  may be sure, I&rsquo;ll never be taken alive.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Polwin shut his mouth and said no more. Forde turned  to Sir Hannibal. &lsquo;It seems to me, sir, that we can establish your innocence  with the aid of Mrs. Carney. But it will be just as well to write down a  statement in my pocket book and make this man sign it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Before Trevick could answer a cry was heard and then a  wild shout. Polwin, with a whimper of fear, ran away into the darkness. All at  once down the slope which led from the ten-foot ladder came Morgan waving his  axe. His clothes had been torn in the scuffle with Anak, and his eyes glared  with the light of madness.</p>
  <p>Dericka and Anne both shrieked when they saw this  madman rushing towards them.</p>
  <p>After him lumbered Anak, shouting.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hold him, hold him; he&rsquo;s quite mad. He&rsquo;s cut my arm  with the axe; catch him, Mr. Forde.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Morgan had foam on his lips and kept screeching like a  wild cat. He dodged Anak as he came forward with his arms outstretched, and  dashed out one of the candles.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Polwin &mdash; I want to kill Polwin! Let me chop  him &mdash; let me &mdash; aaaah &mdash; aaaah &mdash;&rsquo; He gave a wild shriek as he felt himself again  in Anak&rsquo;s mighty grip. The two reeled against Anne, and she dropped her candle.  There was only one left.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dericka! Dericka! Come!&rsquo; cried Forde, grasping her  hand; &lsquo;lead me to this easy shaft and let us get out. Trevick &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take Anne,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, whose candle was  still giving light; &lsquo;God help us all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And indeed there seemed to be much need for such help  then. Here in the bowels of the earth, under the bed of the ocean, in almost  complete darkness, and with a raving madman and murderer struggling with  another criminal &mdash; as Anak truly was &mdash; the position was enough to unsettle the  sanest human being.</p>
  <p>Dericka did not lose her head. Grasping her lover&rsquo;s  hand she drew him swiftly up the slope on the way to the ten-foot ladder,  whence they could easily regain the upper world. Sir Hannibal, holding the  half-fainting Anne on his arm, tried to push past Anak and Morgan to go the  same way, but they swayed from side to side and would not allow him to pass.</p>
  <p>All at once they heard a noise like thunder, and a  moment later Polwin came running out from the darkness towards the glimmer of  the candle held by the baronet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve let the ocean in,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;Morgan will drown,  Morgan &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The lunatic, hearing that hated voice, withdrew  himself with a violent effort from Anak and threw himself like a wild beast of  prey on the steward. At the same time a rush of water came through the levels  from the back part of the mine. Without thinking, Trevick dragged Anne along the  gallery which led to the shaft which was most difficult to climb. Noting his  mistake, she wanted to turn back.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t climb there &mdash; we can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she screamed,  struggling.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We must &mdash; we must,&rsquo; panted the baronet, stumbling  along over the uneven ground, which was now covered with salt water up to their  ankles.</p>
  <p>Polwin, screaming like a woman with terror, strove to  get away from Morgan, and managed to grasp Anak&rsquo;s arm. The giant, who had no  desire to be drowned like a rat in a trap, shook him off. But Morgan, hearing  the roar of the flood and feeling the water rising higher threw his arms round  both men, shouting exultingly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll swim together in the water &mdash; we&rsquo;ll swim &mdash; we&rsquo;ll  wash &mdash; Ha! Ha!&rsquo; His laughter echoed wildly through the galleries, and Anak  swore, while his father wailed wildly, fighting all the time. A great wave came  thundering through the level, and swept them along down the passage towards the  flying forms of Sir Hannibal and Anne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Leave me &mdash; leave me,&rsquo; cried Anne.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! Courage! I&rsquo;ll save you,&rsquo; gasped the baronet, and  felt that he must risk all for this woman who risked so much for him. She  stumbled and fell. He caught her in his arms, and with supernatural strength,  as it seemed, waded waist deep in water to the shaft. Fortunately they were not  far from it, and had just managed to get under the glimpse of daylight far  overhead when wave after wave of the bitter incoming ocean came sweeping along  the levels and past the shaft, filling that as they went along. And past them a  writhing trio was carried, sucked down by the waters into the very depths of  the mine. Morgan held father and son in a death grip, and Heaven only knows to  what depths the bodies were sucked by the fierce power of the waves.</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal lifted Anne as high as he could. &lsquo;Grasp  that beam,&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;quick, quick, the water is gaining.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>With an effort of despair she stretched and swung  herself on the decayed beam. Trevick followed, keeping as close to her as he  could.</p>
  <p>The water rose and rose with a sucking noise as though  it wanted to drown them. By holding on to various projections and stone and  beams the man and woman managed to float upward on the surface of the rising  waters. Then, when nearly at the top, the water stopped rising, and the two  clung to a great stone, expecting it every moment to give way.</p>
  <p>Trevick shouted loudly. In a few minutes they saw two  pale faces peering down. They were those of Forde and Dericka, and they could  hear the girl cry aloud with joy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We thought you were dead,&rsquo; she said gladly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We will be soon. Help! help!&rsquo; gasped Sir Hannibal.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wait &mdash; wait,&rsquo; shouted Forde, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s an old rusty  chain dangling from the tower. Hold on!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He ran away, and in ten minutes, which seemed like an  eternity to the wretched pair, came back along with Dericka and a chain. Both  the girl&rsquo;s hands and those of her lover were bleeding from their efforts to  detach the chain from a rusty old windlass. Forde let it down with the help of  Dericka. Luckily it was not very heavy, and the links held fast. Anne caught at  the chain, and, by holding on to the side of the shaft, was slowly drawn up.  Then Sir Hannibal followed, and the two found themselves under the bright sky,  saved from a most terrible death.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the others?&rsquo; asked Dericka, trembling.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dead!&rsquo; said Trevick solemnly.</p>
  <p>Forde took off his cap. &lsquo;I say what the judge says to  a condemned prisoner,&rsquo; he said in a deep, slow voice &mdash;&lsquo;God have mercy on their  souls.&rsquo;</p>


  <p align="center">* * * * * * </p>
  <p>Naturally there was great excitement when the whole  story became known at St. Ewalds. Afterwards reporters came down and a full  account was sent to the London papers. It was found impossible to empty the  mine.</p>
  <p>Apparently Polwin, alias Krent, alias Carney, knowing  the weakness of the crust between the mine and the sea, had broken it through  in the hope of drowning Morgan, who he feared, and his own son, Hugh, who might  have witnessed against him as being implicated in the murder of John Bowring.  But the idiot had fully revenged himself on the man who had caused him to kill  his father and set fire to the Grange. Far in the bowels of the mine, deep in  salt water, the three bodies rested, and the Tregeagle mine became a grave.</p>
  <p>It was Mrs. Carney who exonerated the baronet. She  came forward regardless that she might be arrested as an accomplice after the  fact, and related her story. It seems that she had never met Polwin &mdash; in spite  of the man&rsquo;s statement to Oswald at the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Arms&rsquo;&mdash; as he had always kept  out of her way, until that fatal hour when he stumbled into her presence  through having missed his way in the mist while seeking Anak. But the big  quarryman had been forced through fear to confess to his mother that he had  attempted the murder of Bowring, and that Morgan had really killed the  millionaire. Far from being angry, Mrs. Carney commended her son for having got  rid of a man she hated. But then Mrs. Carney hated everyone, although she could  give no reason for doing so. The fact is, what with disappointment and a lonely  life and a belief in her own powers of witchcraft, the woman&rsquo;s mind had become  unhinged. Her grievance against Sir Hannibal, as he proved, was entirely  imaginary; and, indeed, since Bowring had been kind to her, she had no real  reason to hate him. However, she thought she had, and so held her tongue. But  hatred against the dead Polwin made her tell the truth, and Sir Hannibal, after  being brought before a magistrate, was completely exonerated, and left the  court, as the saying goes, without a stain on his character.</p>
  <p>There was some talk of prosecuting Mrs. Carney, but  the death of the quarryman finally completed the weakening of her mind. Instead  of going to prison, she was placed in an asylum, and Trevick surrounded her  with every comfort, as he reflected that only her testimony had saved his life.</p>
  <p>It was certainly true that Polwin had confessed in the  presence of Forde and Dericka and Anne. All the same, it was better that the  final defence should come from an outsider. Mrs. Carney never recovered her  wits, but died very shortly, after entering the asylum, cursing her husband,  Bowring and Sir Hannibal with her last breath. The sole person she seemed to  think kindly of was her son Anak, and it was his terrible death that finally  unsettled her reason.</p>
  <p>It had not been difficult to prove that the second  will was a forgery. Mr. and Mrs. Trubby confessed under pressure that Polwin  had forged the will and the name of the testator and had promised them three  thousand pounds to go to America if they signed as witnesses. Forde caught the  two as they were embarking, being sent post haste out of the country by uneasy  consciences, and took them to Gratton. After they had made a signed deposition  to the effect that the second will was forged, the lawyer let them go, and they  departed without a penny for all their rascality. So the money remained with  Dericka after all.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But we&rsquo;ll divide it,&rsquo; said the girl, when Sir  Hannibal was again free and restored to the good graces of his fellow-townsmen.  &mdash;&lsquo;You, papa, will take thirty thousand a year and marry Anne. Oswald and myself  will take the rest, and &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And become husband and wife,&rsquo; said Forde kissing her;  &lsquo;but what about Mrs. Krent, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give Mrs. Krent and Jenny what they want &mdash; two  thousand a year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite right, Dericka,&rsquo; said Sir Hannibal, with a  trace of his old pompous manner; &lsquo;you will give one thousand and I a similar  amount.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Great was the joy of poor Mrs. Krent and Jenny when  they heard this. They were by the burning of the Grange homeless, and by the  death of Bowring and Morgan friendless.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But it&rsquo;s just as well, Miss,&rsquo; said the housekeeper,  when everything was settled and she came to take leave of her benefactress; &lsquo;we  would have had to put poor Morgan in an asylum sooner or later, and then the  poor creature would have died. I was fond of him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And so was I,&rsquo; said Jenny, who had been weeping. &lsquo;If  Morgan hadn&rsquo;t been worried by his father and Mr. Polwin he would never have  been so wicked.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be judged differently to a sane person,&rsquo; said  Dericka gently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rsquo; said Mrs. Krent; &lsquo;however, he&rsquo;s  gone, and we haven&rsquo;t even the satisfaction of burying him, seeing he&rsquo;s in that  dreadful mine. Oh, deary me, how awful it all has been.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You have much to be thankful for, Mrs. Krent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mrs. Ward, my dear; and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m mainly  thankful for. To think that such a terrible man will never bother me again is  enough to send me crazy with joy. Jenny and me with our two thousand, thanks to  you, dear Miss Trevick, will go to South Africa, and I dare say Jenny will  marry again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Perhaps you will also, Mrs. Krent &mdash; I mean Mrs.  Ward.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never, my dear; never,&rsquo; said the stout woman firmly.  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of men to last me for the rest of my life,&rsquo; and apparently she  held to this, for although Jenny did marry, Mrs. Ward, formerly Mrs. Krent,  continued to live single for the rest of her life. And that life, after all the  storms Polwin had caused, was singularly peaceful.</p>
  <p>Miss Warry was exposed for her lying prophecy, and  might have been punished for knowing that Polwin intended to kill Bowring but  that she fled to South America and changed her name.</p>
  <p>Dericka always wondered how so meek a woman could have  behaved so badly. But, then, it was the same with Miss Warry as it was with  Mrs. Carney: both of them were women scorned, and all the world knows what  Congreve said on that subject.</p>
  <p>Later on Sir Hannibal married Anne Stretton, and he  set about rebuilding the Grange. Dericka did not marry Forde for some months,  as she wanted to see her father settled with Lady Trevick before leaving him.  The trouble had done Sir Hannibal good, and he was sincerely repentant for all  his shady doings in Africa. Needless to say, Anne made him a splendid wife, and  even Miss Quinton was induced to change her opinion of the lady.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yet, after all,&rsquo; said the new Lady Trevick, when she  and Dericka were out watching the building of the new Grange, &lsquo;I was an  adventuress, you know, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are the best woman in the world,&rsquo; said Dericka,  kissing here. &lsquo;Few women would have done for my poor father what you have  done.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He saved my life, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In order to gain the best wife in the world. By the  way, Anne, what about Mr. Penrith?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Trevick coloured.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I think I treated him rather badly, my dear Dericka,&rsquo;  she said in a low tone; &lsquo;he has gone to America, and I hear that he is about to  marry an heiress.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In that case, when he consoles himself so quickly, I  don&rsquo;t think you need blame yourself very much,&rsquo; said Dericka dryly, &lsquo;but here  come papa and Oswald.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Hannibal, now looking quite his old self, came  forward and greeted his wife with a smile. Then he carried her off to see about  a new staircase upon which he wanted her opinion.</p>
  <p>Left alone with Dericka, Oswald suddenly spoke.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come down to the Tregeagle mine, Dericka.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She drew back. &lsquo;Why do you want to go to that horrid  place?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when we get there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dericka looked at him doubtfully, then curiosity got  the better of her and she took his arm. They went down the high road and down  the stony watercourse which led to the grey tower. It was a fine spring day,  and Dericka enjoyed the walk. But she changed colour when she saw the scene of  their misadventure, and drew back from the cliffs.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Oswald, to think that we might have been drowned  had we not escaped by that easy shaft.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As it was, your father and his wife were nearly  drowned,&rsquo; said the barrister cheerfully; &lsquo;come down, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Still wondering, Dericka descended carefully. They  looked into both shafts and found them pools of salt sea water. Then Oswald  made Dericka sit down and went poking industriously amongst the rocks and  grass. Finally he gave a cry of satisfaction, and came to Dericka bearing what  looked like a red ball.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she said, turning pale and starting to her feet,  &lsquo;the Death&rsquo;s Head! Where did you find it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In the herbage yonder, that is why I brought you  down. I fancied that Morgan might have brought it down here when he left Mrs.  Carney&rsquo;s hut. I have searched several times, but without success. You have  brought me good luck, dearest.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And now?&rsquo; asked Dericka, eyeing the uncanny object  with repulsion.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now we&rsquo;ll drop it into the mine,&rsquo; suiting the action  to the word.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But why did you seek it at all?&rsquo; asked the girl, when  the horrible scarlet, silver-crowned skull disappeared into the shaft.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We are to be married next week, my dear,&rsquo; he said  seriously, &lsquo;and I want every vestige of this terrible affair buried out of  sight along with the bodies of those who worked so much ill.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And then we&rsquo;ll never speak of it any more,&rsquo; said  Dericka hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo; He pointed to the water in the shaft which had  so nearly engulfed Sir Hannibal and Anne Stretton: &lsquo;There is the last of the  Death&rsquo;s Head. We&rsquo;ll never speak of it or talk of it again. But, after all,  Dericka,&rsquo; he added, slipping his hand into hers, &lsquo;it did bring us a certain  amount of luck. We have thirty thousand a year, remember.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We have each other,&rsquo; said Miss Trevick fondly, &lsquo;but  come away, Oswald; let us climb the cliff and leave the past behind us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They set their faces towards the future and climbed  into the gay sunshine which was henceforth to gild their lives.</p>
