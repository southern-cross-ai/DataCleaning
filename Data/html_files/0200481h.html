<h2>Lucy Gayheart<br>

<h2>BOOK I</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>In Haverford on the Platte the townspeople still talk of Lucy
Gayheart. They do not talk of her a great deal, to be sure; life
goes on and we live in the present. But when they do mention her
name it is with a gentle glow in the face or the voice, a
confidential glance which says: "Yes, you, too, remember?" They
still see her as a slight figure always in motion; dancing or
skating, or walking swiftly with intense direction, like a bird
flying home.</p>

<p>When there is a heavy snowfall, the older people look out of
their windows and remember how Lucy used to come darting through
just such storms, her muff against her cheek, not shrinking, but
giving her body to the wind as if she were catching step with it.
And in the heat of summer she came just as swiftly down the long
shaded sidewalks and across the open squares blistering in the sun.
In the breathless glare of August noons, when the horses hung their
heads and the workmen "took it slow," she never took it slow. Cold,
she used to say, made her feel more alive; heat must have had the
same effect.</p>

<p>The Gayhearts lived at the west edge of Haverford, half a mile
from Main Street. People said "out to the Gayhearts'" and thought
it rather a long walk in summer. But Lucy covered the distance a
dozen times a day, covered it quickly with that walk so peculiarly
her own, like an expression of irrepressible light-heartedness.
When the old women at work in their gardens caught sight of her in
the distance, a mere white figure under the flickering shade of the
early summer trees, they always knew her by the way she moved. On
she came, past hedges and lilac bushes and woolly-green grape
arbours and rows of jonquils, and one knew she was delighted with
everything; with her summer clothes and the air and the sun and the
blossoming world. There was something in her nature that was like
her movements, something direct and unhesitating and joyous, and in
her golden-brown eyes. They were not gentle brown eyes, but flashed
with gold sparks like that Colorado stone we call the tiger-eye.
Her skin was rather dark, and the colour in her lips and cheeks was
like the red of dark peonies&mdash;deep, velvety. Her mouth was so
warm and impulsive that every shadow of feeling made a change in
it.</p>

<p>Photographs of Lucy mean nothing to her old friends. It was her
gaiety and grace they loved. Life seemed to lie very near the
surface in her. She had that singular brightness of young beauty:
flower gardens have it for the first few hours after sunrise.</p>

<p>We missed Lucy in Haverford when she went away to Chicago to
study music. She was eighteen years old then; talented, but too
careless and light-hearted to take herself very seriously. She
never dreamed of a "career." She thought of music as a natural form
of pleasure, and as a means of earning money to help her father
when she came home. Her father, Jacob Gayheart, led the town band
and gave lessons on the clarinet, flute, and violin, at the back of
his watch-repairing shop. Lucy had given piano lessons to beginners
ever since she was in the tenth grade. Children liked her, because
she never treated them like children; they tried to please her,
especially the little boys.</p>

<p>Though Jacob Gayheart was a good watchmaker, he wasn't a good
manager. Born of Bavarian parents in the German colony at
Belleville, Illinois, he had learned his trade under his father. He
came to Haverford young and married an American wife, who brought
him a half-section of good farm land. After her death he borrowed
money on this farm to buy another, and now they were both
mortgaged. That troubled his older daughter, Pauline, but it did
not trouble Mr. Gayheart. He took more pains to make the band boys
practise than he did to keep up his interest payments. He was a
town character, of course, and people joked about him, though they
were proud of their band. Mr. Gayheart looked like an old
daguerreotype of a minor German poet; he wore a moustache and
goatee and had a fine sweep of dark hair above his forehead, just a
little grey at the sides. His intelligent, lazy hazel eyes seemed
to say: "But it's a very pleasant world, why bother?"</p>

<p>He managed to enjoy every day from start to finish. He got up
early in the morning and worked for an hour in his flower garden.
Then he took his bath and dressed for the day, selecting his shirt
and necktie as carefully as if he were going to pay a visit. After
breakfast he lit a good cigar and walked into town, never missing
the flavour of his tobacco for a moment. Usually he put a flower in
his coat before he left home. No one ever got more satisfaction out
of good health and simple pleasures and a blue-and-gold band
uniform than Jacob Gayheart. He was probably the happiest man in
Haverford.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>It was the end of the Christmas holidays, the Christmas of 1901,
Lucy's third winter in Chicago. She was spending her vacation at
home. There had been good skating all through Christmas week, and
she had made the most of it. Even on her last afternoon, when she
should have been packing, she was out with a party of Haverford
boys and girls, skating on the long stretch of ice north of Duck
Island. This island, nearly half a mile in length, split the river
in two,&mdash;or, rather, it split a shallow arm off the river. The
Platte River proper was on the south side of this island and it
seldom froze over; but the shallow stream between the island and
the north shore froze deep and made smooth ice. This was before the
days of irrigation from the Platte; it was then a formidable river
in flood time. During the spring freshets it sometimes cut out a
new channel in the soft farm land along its banks and changed its
bed altogether.</p>

<p>At about four o'clock on this December afternoon a light sleigh
with bells and buffalo robes and a good horse came rapidly along
the road from town and turned at Benson's corner into the
skating-place. A tall young man sprang out, tied his horse to the
hitch-bar, where a row of sleighs already stood, and hurried to the
shore with his skating-shoes in his hand. As he put them on, he
scanned the company moving over the ice. It was not hard to pick
out the figure he was looking for. Six of the strongest skaters had
left the others behind and were going against the wind, toward the
end of the island. Two were in advance of the rest, Jim Hardwick
and Lucy Gayheart. He knew her by her brown squirrel jacket and fur
cap, and by her easy stroke. The two ends of a long crimson scarf
were floating on the wind behind her, like two slender crimson
wings.</p>

<p>Harry Gordon struck out across the ice to overtake her. He, too,
was a fine skater; a big fellow, the heavy-weight boxer type, and
as light on his feet as a boxer. Nevertheless he was a trifle
winded when he passed the group of four and shot alongside Jim
Hardwick.</p>

<p>"Jim," he called, "will you give me a turn with Lucy before the
sun goes down?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Harry. I was only keeping her out of mischief for you."
The lad fell back. Haverford boys gave way to Harry Gordon
good-naturedly. He was the rich young man of the town, and he was
not arrogant or overbearing. He was known as a good fellow; rather
hard in business, but liberal with the ball team and the band;
public-spirited, people said.</p>

<p>"Why, Harry, you said you weren't coming!" Lucy exclaimed as she
took his arm.</p>

<p>"Didn't think I could. I did, though. Drove Flicker into a
lather getting out here after the directors' meeting. This is the
best part of the afternoon, anyway. Come along." They crossed hands
and went straight ahead in two-step time.</p>

<p>The sun was dropping low in the south, and all the flat
snow-covered country, as far as the eye could see, was beginning to
glow with a rose-coloured light, which presently would deepen to
orange and flame. The black tangle of willows on the island made a
thicket like a thorn hedge, and the knotty, twisted, slow-growing
scrub-oaks with flat tops took on a bronze glimmer in that intense
oblique light which seemed to be setting them on fire.</p>

<p>As the sun declined, the wind grew sharper. They had left the
skating party far behind. "Shan't we turn?" Lucy gasped
presently.</p>

<p>"Not yet. I want to get into that sheltered fork of the island.
I have some Scotch whisky in my pocket; that will warm you up."</p>

<p>"How nice! I'm getting a little tired. I've been out a long
while."</p>

<p>The end of the island forked like a fish's tail. When they had
rounded one of these points, Harry swung her in to the shore. They
sat down on a bleached cottonwood log, where the black willow
thicket behind them made a screen. The interlacing twigs threw off
red light like incandescent wires, and the snow underneath was
rose-colour. Harry poured Lucy some whisky in the metal cup that
screwed over the stopper; he himself drank from the flask. The
round red sun was falling like a heavy weight; it touched the
horizon line and sent quivering fans of red and gold over the wide
country. For a moment Lucy and Harry Gordon were sitting in a
stream of blinding light; it burned on their skates and on the
flask and the metal cup. Their faces became so brilliant that they
looked at each other and laughed. In an instant the light was gone;
the frozen stream and the snow-masked prairie land became violet,
under the blue-green sky. Wherever one looked there was nothing but
flat country and low hills, all violet and grey. Lucy gave a long
sigh.</p>

<p>Gordon lifted her from the log and they started back, with the
wind behind them. They found the river empty, a lonely stretch of
blue-grey ice; all the skaters had gone. Harry knew by her stroke
that Lucy was tired. She had been out a long while before he came,
and she had made a special effort to skate with him. He was sorry
and pleased. He guided her in to the shore at some distance from
his sleigh, knelt down and took off her skating shoes, changed his
own, and with a sudden movement swung her up in his arms and
carried her over the trampled snow to his cutter. As he tucked her
under the buffalo robes she thanked him.</p>

<p>"The wind seems to have made me very sleepy, Harry. I'm afraid I
won't do much packing tonight. No matter; there's tomorrow. And it
was a good skate."</p>

<p>On the drive home Gordon let his sleigh-bells (very musical
bells, he had got them to please Lucy) do most of the talking. He
knew when to be quiet.</p>

<p>Lucy felt drowsy and dreamy, glad to be warm. The sleigh was
such a tiny moving spot on that still white country settling into
shadow and silence. Suddenly Lucy started and struggled under the
tight blankets. In the darkening sky she had seen the first star
come out; it brought her heart into her throat. That point of
silver light spoke to her like a signal, released another kind of
life and feeling which did not belong here. It overpowered her.
With a mere thought she had reached that star and it had answered,
recognition had flashed between. Something knew, then, in the
unknowing waste: something had always known, forever! That joy of
saluting what is far above one was an eternal thing, not merely
something that had happened to her ignorance and her foolish
heart.</p>

<p>The flash of understanding lasted but a moment. Then everything
was confused again. Lucy shut her eyes and leaned on Harry's
shoulder to escape from what she had gone so far to snatch. It was
too bright and too sharp. It hurt, and made one feel small and
lost.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The following night, Sunday evening, all the boys and girls who
had been at home for the vacation were going back to school. Most
of them would stop at Lincoln; Lucy was the only one going through
to Chicago. The train from the west was due to leave Haverford at
seven-thirty, and by seven o'clock sleighs and wagons from all
directions were driving toward the railway station at the south end
of town.</p>

<p>The station platform was soon full of restless young people,
glancing up the track, looking at their watches, as if they could
not endure their own town a moment longer. Presently a carriage
drawn by two horses dashed up to the siding, and the swaying crowd
ran to meet it, shouting.</p>

<p>"Here she is, here's Fairy!"</p>

<p>"Fairy Blair!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Fairy!"</p>

<p>Out jumped a yellow-haired girl, supple and quick as a kitten,
with a little green Tyrolese hat pulled tight over her curls. She
ripped off her grey fur coat, threw it into the air for the boys to
catch, and ran down the platform in her travelling suit&mdash;a
black velvet jacket and scarlet waistcoat, with a skirt very short
indeed for the fashion of that time. Just then a man came out from
the station and called that the train would be twenty minutes late.
Groans and howls broke from the crowd.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!"</p>

<p>"What in thunder can we do?"</p>

<p>The green hat shrugged and laughed. "Shut up. Quit swearing.
We'll wake the town."</p>

<p>She caught two boys by the elbow, and between these stiffly
overcoated figures raced out into the silent street, swaying from
left to right, pushing the boys as if she were shaking two
saplings, and doing an occasional shuffle with her feet. She had a
pretty, common little face, and her eyes were so lit-up and
reckless that one might have thought she had been drinking. Her
fresh little mouth, without being ugly, was really very naughty.
She couldn't push the boys fast enough; suddenly she sprang from
between the two rigid figures as if she had been snapped out of a
sling-shot and ran up the street with the whole troop at her heels.
They were all a little crazy, but as she was the craziest, they
followed her. They swerved aside to let the town bus pass.</p>

<p>The bus backed up to the siding. Mr. Gayheart alighted and gave
a hand to each of his daughters. Pauline, the elder, got out first.
She was short and stout and blonde, like the Prestons, her mother's
people. She was twelve years Lucy's senior. (Two boys, born between
the daughters, died in childhood.) It was Pauline who had brought
her sister up; their mother died when Lucy was only six.</p>

<p>Pauline was talking as she got out of the bus, urging her father
to hurry and get the trunk checked. "There are always a lot of
people in the baggage room, and it takes Bert forever to check a
trunk. And be sure you tell him to get it onto this train. When
Mrs. Young went to Minneapolis her trunk lay here for twenty-four
hours after she started, and she didn't get it until..." But Mr.
Gayheart walked calmly away and lost the story of Mrs. Young's
trunk. Lucy remained standing beside her sister, but she did not
hear it either. She was thinking of something else.</p>

<p>Pauline took Lucy's arm determinedly, as if it were the right
thing to do, and for a moment she was silent. "Look, there's Harry
Gordon's sleigh coming up, with the Jenks boy driving. Do you
suppose he is going east tonight?"</p>

<p>"He said he might go to Omaha," Lucy replied carelessly.</p>

<p>"That's nice. You will have company," said Pauline, with the
rough-and-ready heartiness she often used to conceal annoyance.</p>

<p>Lucy made no comment, but looked in through a window at the
station clock. She had never wanted so much to be moving; to be
alone and to feel the train gliding along the smooth rails; to
watch the little stations flash by.</p>

<p>Fairy Blair, in her Tyrolese hat, came back from her run quite
out of breath and supported by the two boys. As she passed the
Gayheart sisters she called:</p>

<p>"Off for the East, Lucy? Wish I were going with you. You musical
people get all the fun." As she and her overcoated props came to a
standstill she watched Lucy out of the tail of her eye. They were
the two most popular girls in Haverford, and Fairy found Lucy
frightfully stuffy and girly-girly. Whenever she met Harry Gordon
she tossed her head and flashed at him a look which plainly said:
"What in hell do you want with <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gayheart returned, gave his daughter her trunk check, and
stood looking up at the sky. Among other impractical pursuits he
had studied astronomy from time to time. When at last the scream of
the whistle shivered through the still winter air, Lucy drew a
quick breath and started forward. Her father took her arm and
pressed it softly; it was not wise to show too much affection for
his younger daughter. A long line of swaying lights came out of the
flat country to the west, and a moment later the white beam from
the headlight streamed along the steel rails at their feet. The
great locomotive, coated with hoar-frost, passed them and stopped,
panting heavily.</p>

<p>Pauline snatched her sister and gave her a clumsy kiss. Mr.
Gayheart picked up Lucy's bag and led the way to the right car. He
found her seat, arranged her things neatly, then stood looking at
her with a discerning, appreciative smile. He liked pretty girls,
even in his own family. He put his arm around her, and as he kissed
her he murmured in her ear: "She's a nice girl, my Lucy!" Then he
went slowly down the car and got off just as the porter was taking
up the step. Pauline was already in a fret, convinced that he would
be carried on to the next station.</p>

<p>In Lucy's car were several boys going back to the University at
Lincoln. They at once came to her seat and began talking to her.
When Harry Gordon entered and walked down the aisle, they drew
back, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm going out to the diner now. I'll be back later."</p>

<p>Lucy shrugged as he passed on. Wasn't that just like him? Of
course he knew that she, and all the other students, would have
eaten an early supper at the family board before they started; but
he might have asked her and the boys to go out to the dining-car
with him and have a dessert or a Welsh rabbit. Another instance of
the instinctive unwastefulness which had made the Gordons rich!
Harry could be splendidly extravagant upon occasion, but he made an
occasion of it; it was the outcome of careful forethought.</p>

<p>Lucy gave her whole attention to the lads who were so pleased to
have it. They were all about her own age, while Harry was eight
years older. Fairy Blair was holding a little court at the other
end of the car, but distance did not muffle her occasional
spasmodic laugh&mdash;a curious laugh, like a bleat, which had the
effect of an indecent gesture. When this mirth broke out, the boys
who were beside Lucy looked annoyed, and drew closer to her, as if
protesting their loyalty. She was sorry when Harry Gordon came back
and they went away. She received him rather coolly, but he didn't
notice that at all. He began talking at once about the new
street-lamps they were to have in Haverford; he and his father had
borne half the cost of them.</p>

<p>Harry sat comfortably back in the Pullman seat, but he did not
lounge. He sat like a gentleman. He had a good physical presence,
whether in action or repose. He was immensely conceited, but not
nervously or aggressively so. Instead of being a weakness in him,
it amounted to a kind of strength. Such easy self-possession was
very reassuring to a mercurial, vacillating person like Lucy.</p>

<p>Tonight, as it happened, Lucy wanted to be alone; but ordinarily
she was glad to meet Harry anywhere; to pass him in the post-office
or to see him coming down the street. If she stopped for only a
word with him, his vitality and unfailing satisfaction with life
set her up. No matter what they talked about, it was amusing. She
felt absolutely free with him, and she found everything about him
genial; his voice, his keen blue eyes, his fresh skin and sandy
hair. People said he was hard in business and took advantage of
borrowers in a tight place; but neither his person nor his manner
gave a hint of such qualities.</p>

<p>While he was chatting confidentially with her about the new
street-lamps, Harry noticed that Lucy's hands were restless and
that she moved about in her seat.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Lucy? You're fidgety."</p>

<p>She pulled herself up and smiled. "Isn't it silly! Travelling
always makes me nervous. But I'm not very used to it, you
know."</p>

<p>"You're in a hurry to get back. I can tell," he nodded
knowingly. "How about the opera this spring? Will you let me come
on for a week and go with me every night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be splendid! But I don't know about every night.
I'm teaching now, you see. I'm much busier than I was last
year."</p>

<p>"We can fix that all right. I'll make a call on Auerbach. I got
on with him first-rate. I told him I had known you ever since you
were a youngster." Harry chuckled and leaned forward a little. "Do
you know the first time I ever saw you, Lucy? It was in the old
skating-rink. I suppose Haverford was about the last town on earth
to have a skating-rink."</p>

<p>"But that was ages ago. The old rink was pulled down before your
bank was built."</p>

<p>"That's right. Father and I were staying at the hotel. We had
come on to look the town over. One afternoon I was passing the rink
and I heard a piano going, so I went in. An old man was playing a
waltz, Hearts and Flowers I think they called it. There were a
bunch of people on the floor, but I picked you out first shot. You
must have been about thirteen, with your hair down your back. You
had on a short skirt and a skin-tight red jersey, and you were
going like a streak. I thought you had the prettiest eyes in the
world&mdash;Still think so," he added, puckering his brows, as if
he were making a grave admission.</p>

<p>Lucy laughed. Harry was cautious, even in compliments.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Harry! I had such good times in that old rink. I
missed it terribly after it was pulled down. Pauline wouldn't let
me go to dances then. But I don't remember you very well until you
began to pitch for Haverford. Everyone was crazy about your
in-curves. Why did you give up baseball?"</p>

<p>"Too lazy, I guess." He shrugged his smooth shoulders. "I liked
playing ball, though. But now about the opera. You'll keep the
first two weeks of April open for me? I can't tell now just when
I'll be able to run on."</p>

<p>Young Gordon was watching Lucy as they talked, and thinking that
he had about made up his mind. He wasn't rash, he hadn't been in a
hurry. He didn't like the idea of marrying the watchmaker's
daughter, when so many brilliant opportunities were open to him.
But as he had often told himself before, he would just have to
swallow the watchmaker. During the two winters Lucy had been away
in Chicago, he had played about with lots of girls in the cities
where his father's business took him. But there was simply nobody
like her,&mdash;for him, at least.</p>

<p>Tomorrow he would have to deal with a rather delicate situation.
Harriet Arkwright, of the St. Joseph Arkwrights, was visiting a
friend in Omaha, and she had telephoned him to come on and take her
to a dance. He had carried things along pretty far with Miss
Arkwright. Her favour was flattering to a small-town man. She was a
person of position in St. Joe. Her father was president of the
oldest banking house, and she had a considerable fortune of her
own, from her mother. If she was twenty-six years old and still
unmarried, it was not from lack of suitors. She had been in no
hurry to tie herself up. She managed her own property very
successfully, travelled a good deal, liked her independence. A
woman of the world, Harry considered her; good style, always at her
ease, had a kind of authority that money and social position give.
But she was plain, confound it! She looked like the men of her
family. And she had a hard, matter-of-fact voice, which never
kindled with anything; slightly nasal. Whatever she spoke of, she
divested of charm. If she thanked him for his gorgeous roses, her
tone deflowered the flowers.</p>

<p>Harry liked to play with the idea of how such a marriage would
affect his future, but he had never tried to make himself believe
that he was in love with Harriet. Strangely enough, the only girl
who gave him any deep thrill was this same Lucy, who lived in his
own town, was poor as a church mouse, never flattered him, and
often laughed at him. When he was with her, life was different;
that was all.</p>

<p>And she was growing up, he realized. All through the Christmas
vacation he had felt a change in her. She was perhaps a trifle more
reserved. At the dance, on New Year's Eve, he thought she held
herself away from him just a little&mdash;and from everyone else.
She wasn't cold, she had never looked lovelier, never been more
playfully affectionate toward her old friends. But she was not
there in the old way. All evening her eyes shone with something she
did not tell him. The moment she was not talking to someone, that
look came back. And in every waltz she seemed to be looking over
his shoulder at something&mdash;positively enchanting!...whereas
there was only the same old crowd, dancing in the Masonic Hall,
with a "crash" over the Masonic carpet. He would not soon forget
that New Year's Eve. It had brought him up short. Lucy wasn't an
artless, happy little country girl any longer; she was headed
toward something. He had better be making up his mind. Even
tonight, here on the train, when she seemed to give him her whole
attention, she didn't, really.</p>

<p>The porter came for Gordon's bags, and said they were pulling
into Omaha. Lucy went out to the vestibule with Harry, and they
talked in low tones during the stop. He stood holding her hand and
looking down at her with that blue-eyed friendliness which seemed
so transparent and uncalculating, until the porter called "All
aboard!" Harry kissed her on the cheek and stepped down to the
station platform. Lucy waved to him through the window while the
train was pulling out.</p>

<p>Gordon got into a horse cab and started for his hotel. His chin
was lowered in his muffler, and he smiled at the street-lights as
the cab rattled along. Yes, he told himself, he must use diplomacy
with Miss Arkwright for a while longer. Her stock was going down.
He meant to commit the supreme extravagance and marry for beauty.
He meant to have a wife other men would envy him.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Lucy undressed quickly, got into her berth, and turned off the
lights. At last she was alone, lying still in the dark, and could
give herself up to the vibration of the train,&mdash;a rhythm that
had to do with escape, change, chance, with life hurrying forward.
That sense of release and surrender went all over her body; she
seemed to lie in it as in a warm bath. Tomorrow night at this time
she would be coming home from Clement Sebastian's recital. In a few
hours one could cover that incalculable distance; from the winter
country and homely neighbours, to the city where the air trembled
like a tuning-fork with unimaginable possibilities.</p>

<p>Lucy carried in her mind a very individual map of Chicago: a
blur of smoke and wind and noise, with flashes of blue water, and
certain clear outlines rising from the confusion; a high building
on Michigan Avenue where Sebastian had his studio&mdash;the stretch
of park where he sometimes walked in the afternoon&mdash;the
Cathedral door out of which she had seen him come one
morning&mdash;the concert hall where she first heard him sing. This
city of feeling rose out of the city of fact like a definite
composition,&mdash;beautiful because the rest was blotted out. She
thought of the steps leading down from the Art Museum as
perpetually flooded with orange-red sunlight; they had been like
that one stormy November afternoon when Sebastian came out of the
building at five o'clock and stopped beside one of the bronze lions
to turn up the collar of his overcoat, light a cigarette, and look
vaguely up and down the avenue before he hailed a cab and drove
away.</p>

<p>In the round of her day's engagements, hurrying about Chicago
from one place to another, Lucy often came upon spots which gave
her a sudden lift of the heart, made her feel glad before she knew
why. Tonight, lying in her berth, she thought she would be happy to
be going back, even if Clement Sebastian were no longer there. She
would still be going back to "the city," to the place where so many
memories and sensations were piled up, where a window or a doorway
or a street-corner with a magical meaning might at any moment flash
out of the fog.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>The next morning Lucy was in Chicago, in her own room, unpacking
and putting her things to rights. She lived in a somewhat unusual
manner; had a room two flights up over a bakery, in one of the
grimy streets off the river.</p>

<p>When she first came to Chicago she had stayed at a students'
boarding-house, but she didn't like the pervasive informality of
the place, nor the Southern gentlewoman of fallen fortunes who
conducted it. She told her teacher, Professor Auerbach, that she
would never get on unless she could live alone with her piano,
where there would be no gay voices in the hall or friendly taps at
her door. Auerbach took her out to his house, and they consulted
with his wife. Mrs. Auerbach knew exactly what to do. She and Lucy
went to see Mrs. Schneff and her bakery.</p>

<p>The Schneff bakery was an old German landmark in that part of
the city. On the ground floor was the bake shop, and a homely
restaurant specializing in German dishes, conducted by Mrs.
Schneff. On the top floor was a glove factory. The three floors
between, the Schneffs rented to people who did not want to take
long leases; travelling salesmen, clerks, railroad men who must be
near the station. The food in the bakery downstairs was good
enough, and there were no table companions or table jokes. Everyone
had his own little table, attended to his own business, and read
his paper. Lucy had taken a room here at once, and for the first
time in her life she could come and go like a boy; no one fussing
about, no one hovering over her. There were inconveniences, to be
sure. The lodgers came and went by an open stairway which led up
from the street beside the front door of the restaurant; the winter
winds blew up through the halls&mdash;burglars might come, too, but
so far they never had. There was no parlour in which Lucy could
receive callers. When she went anywhere with one of Auerbach's
students, the young man waited for her on the stairway, or met her
in the restaurant below.</p>

<p>This morning Lucy was glad as never before to be back with her
own things and her own will. After she had unpacked, she arranged
and rearranged; nothing was too much trouble. The moment she had
shut the door upon the baggage man, she seemed to find herself
again. Out there in Haverford she had scarcely been herself at all;
she had been trying to feel and behave like someone she no longer
was; as children go on playing the old games to please their
elders, after they have ceased to be children at heart. Coming up
from the station, through a pecking fall of sleet, she wondered
whether something she had left in this room might have vanished in
her absence; might not be there to welcome her. It was here she had
come the night after she first heard Clement Sebastian, and here
she had brought back all her chance glimpses of him. These four
walls held all her thoughts and feelings about him. Her memories
did not stand out separately; they were blended and pervasive. They
made the room seem larger than it was, quieter and more guarded;
gave it a slight austerity.</p>

<p>Since she was going to Sebastian's recital tonight, Lucy had her
dinner early, in the restaurant below. When she came upstairs
again, it was not yet time to dress. She put on her dressing-gown,
turned out the gas light, and lay down to reflect.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Only three months ago, early in October, Professor Auerbach had
told her that his old friend, Clement Sebastian, was in Chicago,
and that she must hear him&mdash;probably he would not be there
long. He was a man one couldn't afford to miss. But Lucy had little
money and many wants; a baritone voice didn't seem to be one of the
most vehement. She missed his first recital without regret, though
afterwards the newspaper notices, and the talk she heard among the
students, aroused her curiosity. The following week he gave a
benefit recital for the survivors of a mine disaster. Auerbach got
a single ticket for her, and she went alone. She had dressed here,
in this room, without much enthusiasm, rather reluctant to go out
again after a tiring day. She had turned on the steam heat and put
out the gas and gone downstairs, anticipating nothing.</p>

<p>Sebastian's personality had aroused her, even before he began to
sing, the moment he came upon the stage. He was not young, was
middle-aged, indeed, with a stern face and large, rather tired
eyes. He was a very big man; tall, heavy, broad-shouldered. He took
up a great deal of space and filled it solidly. His torso, sheathed
in black broadcloth and a white waistcoat, was unquestionably oval,
but it seemed the right shape for him. She said to herself
immediately: "Yes, a great artist should look like that."</p>

<p>The first number was a Schubert song she had never heard or even
seen. His diction was one of the remarkable things about
Sebastian's singing, and she did not miss a word of the German. A
Greek sailor, returned from a voyage, stands in the temple of
Castor and Pollux, the mariners stars, and acknowledges their
protection. He has steered his little boat by their mild,
protecting light, eure Milde, eure Wachen. In recognition of their
aid he hangs his oar as a votive offering in the porch of their
temple.</p>

<p>The song was sung as a religious observance in the classical
spirit, a rite more than a prayer; a noble salutation to beings so
exalted that in the mariner's invocation there was no humbleness
and no entreaty. In your light I stand without fear, O august
stars! I salute your eternity. That was the feeling. Lucy had never
heard anything sung with such elevation of style. In its calmness
and serenity there was a kind of large enlightenment, like
daybreak.</p>

<p>After this invocation came five more Schubert songs, all
melancholy. They made Lucy feel that there was something profoundly
tragic about this man. The dark beauty of the songs seemed to her a
quality in the voice itself, as kindness can be in the touch of a
hand. It was as simple as that&mdash;like light changing on the
water. When he began Der Doppelganger, the last song of the group
(Still ist die Nacht, es ruhen die Gassen), it was like moonlight
pouring down on the narrow street of an old German town. With every
phrase that picture deepened&mdash;moonlight, intense and calm,
sleeping on old human houses; and somewhere a lonely black cloud in
the night sky. So manche Nacht in alter Zeit? The moon was gone,
and the silent street.&mdash;And Sebastian was gone, though Lucy
had not been aware of his exit. The black cloud that had passed
over the moon and the song had obliterated him, too. There was
nobody left before the grey velvet curtain but the red-haired
accompanist, a lame boy, who dragged one foot as he went across the
stage.</p>

<p>Through the rest of the recital her attention was intermittent.
Sometimes she listened intently, and the next moment her mind was
far away. She was struggling with something she had never felt
before. A new conception of art? It came closer than that. A new
kind of personality? But it was much more. It was a discovery about
life, a revelation of love as a tragic force, not a melting mood,
of passion that drowns like black water. As she sat listening to
this man the outside world seemed to her dark and terrifying, full
of fears and dangers that had never come close to her until
now.</p>

<p>A note on the program said there would be no encores. After the
last number, when the singer had repeatedly come back to
acknowledge applause, the lights above the stage were turned out.
But the audience remained seated. A French basso from the New York
opera, who happened to be in town, occupied a stage box with a
party of friends. He kept calling:</p>

<p>Clement! Clement!</p>

<p>At last the baritone came back, his coat on his arm and his hat
in his hand. He bowed to his colleague, the bass, then turned aside
and spoke through the stage door. The lame boy appeared; they had a
word together under the applause. Sebastian walked to the front of
the stage in the half-darkness and began to sing an old setting of
Byron's When We Two Parted; a sad, simple old air which required
little from the singer, yet probably no one who heard it that night
will ever forget it.</p>

<p>Lucy had come home and up the stairs, into this room, tired and
frightened, with a feeling that some protecting barrier was
gone&mdash;a window had been broken that let in the cold and
darkness of the night. Sitting here in her cloak, shivering, she
had whispered over and over the words of that last song:</p>

<blockquote>When we two parted,<br>
In silence and tears,<br>
Half broken-hearted,<br>
To sever for years,<br>
<br>
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,<br>
Colder thy kiss;<br>
Surely that hour foretold<br>
Sorrow to this.</blockquote>

<p>It was as if that song were to have some effect upon her own
life. She tried to forget it, but it was unescapable. It was with
her, like an evil omen; she could not get it out of her mind. For
weeks afterwards it kept singing itself over in her brain. Her
forebodings on that first night had not been mistaken; Sebastian
had already destroyed a great deal for her. Some peoples' lives are
affected by what happens to their person or their property; but for
others fate is what happens to their feelings and their
thoughts&mdash;that and nothing more.</p>

<p>The following day Lucy had questioned Paul Auerbach about
Sebastian, at first timidly, then fiercely. What was his history?
What had he been like as a boy? What made him different from other
singers?</p>

<p>"Oh, but," said Professor Auerbach calmly, "Clement is very
exceptional; he is a fine artist." This exasperated her. It was
like saying, This is a black horse, or, This is a tall tree.
Auerbach promised her that she should meet him some time, but it
never seemed to come off.</p>

<p>Then one afternoon, a few days before the Christmas vacation,
Auerbach came into the back room where Lucy was just finishing with
a pupil and told her he had a surprise for her. Sebastian would be
here at the studio at ten o'clock tomorrow morning. His
accompanist, James Mockford, was to have an operation on his hip
when he got home to England, and for the present his doctor wanted
him to spend his mornings in bed. He might be able to keep his
concert dates, if he got rid of the routine work. Sebastian was
looking for someone to accompany him in his practice hours. He was
coming tomorrow to try out several of Auerbach's pupils, and Lucy
would have a chance to play for him.</p>

<p>"He wants someone young and teachable, not somebody who will try
to teach him. I think you might please him, Lucy. I spoke for
you."</p>

<p>That night, of course, she slept very little. She had never been
nervous when Auerbach asked her to play for his friends; he had
told her this was because she was not ambitious,&mdash;that it was
her greatest fault. But this time it was different. If she didn't
please Sebastian, she would probably never meet him again. If she
did please him&mdash;But that possibility frightened her more than
the other. For an ordinary singer she thought she could do very
well; but she could never play for him. She hadn't it in her. By
five o'clock in the morning she had decided not to appear at the
studio at all; she would decline the risk.</p>

<p>With her breakfast, courage revived. To this day she could not
remember how she ever got to Auerbach's studio, but she arrived
there. As she approached the door, she heard Sebastian singing the
"Largo al Factotum" from the Barber of Seville. It must be John
Patterson at the piano. She slipped in quietly. It was an easier
entrance than she had hoped for. When the aria was over, Auerbach
introduced her. Sebastian was easy and kindly. He took her hand and
looked straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Shall we set to work at once, Miss Gayheart, or had you rather
wait a bit, while Mr. Schneller and I try our luck?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather try now, if you please," she said decidedly.</p>

<p>He laughed. "And get it over with? Don't be nervous. It's no
great matter. We might try this same aria. I seemed not to do it
very well."</p>

<p>Poor young Patterson flushed under his sandy hair; he knew what
that meant.</p>

<p>"Have you ever played the piano accompaniment?" Sebastian asked
as she sat down.</p>

<p>"I haven't happened to. But I've heard the opera."</p>

<p>When they finished he began turning over his music. "Now suppose
we take something quite different." He put an aria from Massenet's
Herodiade, "Vision fugitive," on the rack before her.</p>

<p>Afterwards he called Mr. Schneller, and Lucy sat in a deep
corner of the sofa, remembering the mistakes she had made.
Presently she heard Sebastian thanking the two young men and
telling Auerbach they were a credit to him.</p>

<p>"Now, my boys, I won't keep you any longer. We will have another
practice morning one of these days. I'm going to detain Miss
Gayheart; she was a little nervous and I want her to try again." He
shook hands with Schneller and Patterson, and they left. Then he
took Auerbach's arm and walked with him toward the sofa where Lucy
was sitting. "On the whole, Paul, I think Miss Gayheart would be
the best risk. She is a little uncertain, but she has much the best
touch."</p>

<p>Auerbach spoke up for her.</p>

<p>"She's not usually uncertain. I was surprised when she went
wrong in the Massenet. She reads well at sight."</p>

<p>"I was frightened, Mr. Auerbach," Lucy said feebly.</p>

<p>The large man in the double-breasted morning coat stood before
her and smiled encouragingly. "I know when people are frightened,
my dear. I've seen it before. The point is, you do not make ugly
sounds; that puts me out more than anything. After the holidays you
must come to my studio and we'll try an hour's practice together.
That's the only way to arrive at anything. Just when do you get
back from your vacation?"</p>

<p>On the 3rd of January, she told him.</p>

<p>"Very well, shall we say January 4th, at ten o'clock, in my
studio on Michigan Avenue?" He took a notebook from his pocket and
wrote it down. "You might take the score of Elijah with you and
glance over it." Again he looked at her intently, with real
kindness in his eyes. "Good-bye, Miss Gayheart, and a pleasant
holiday."</p>

<p>That was the last time she had seen him.</p>

<p>Tonight she would hear his Schubert program, and tomorrow
morning at ten she was to be at his studio.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Lucy sprang up from her bed; it was almost time to start for the
concert. She slipped into her only evening dress and put on the
velvet cloak she had bought just before she went home for
Christmas. It was very pretty, she thought, and becoming (she had
quite impoverished herself to have it), but it was not very warm.
Tonight there was a bitter wind blowing off the Lake, but she was
going to have a cab&mdash;anyway, she was not afraid of the cold.
She rather liked the excitement of winding a soft, light cloak
about her bare arms and shoulders and running out into a glacial
cold through which one could hear the hammer-strokes of the workmen
who were thawing out switches down on the freight tracks with
gasoline torches. The thing to do was to make an overcoat of the
cold; to feel one's self warm and awake at the heart of it, one's
blood coursing unchilled in an air where roses froze instantly.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>The recital this evening was given in a small hall, before an
audience made up of Germans and Jews. Lucy arrived very early and
was able to change her seat (which was near Auerbach's) for one at
the back of the house, in the shadow of a pillar, where she could
feel very much alone. She had never heard Die Winterreise sung
straight through as an integral work. For her it was being sung the
first time, something newly created, and she attributed to the
artist much that belonged to the composer. She kept feeling that
this was not an interpretation, this was the thing itself, with one
man and one nature behind every song. The singing was not dramatic,
in any way she knew. Sebastian did not identify himself with this
melancholy youth; he presented him as if he were a memory, not to
be brought too near into the present. One felt a long distance
between the singer and the scenes he was recalling, a long
perspective.</p>

<p>This evening Lucy tried to give some attention to the
accompanist&mdash;there was good reason, surely, if she were to
attempt to take his place tomorrow! Even at the other concert she
had felt that she had never heard anyone play for the voice so
well. Die Krahe, Der Wegweiser...there was something uncanny in
that young man's short, insinuating fingers. She admired him, but
she didn't like him. Was she jealous, already? No, something in his
physical personality set her on edge a little. He was
picturesque&mdash;too picturesque. He had the very white skin that
sometimes goes with red hair, and tonight, as he sat against an
olive-green velvet curtain, his features seemed to disappear
altogether. His face looked like a handful of flour thrown against
the velvet. His head was rather flat behind the ears, and his red
hair seemed to clasp it in a wreath of curls that were stiff but
not tight. She thought she remembered plaster casts in the Art
Museum with just such curls. For some reason she didn't like the
way he moved across the stage. His lameness gave him a weak,
undulating walk, "like a rag walking," she thought. It was
contemptible to hold a man's infirmity against him; besides, if
this young man weren't lame, she would not be going to Sebastian's
studio tomorrow,&mdash;she would never have met him at all. How
strange it was that James Mockford's bad hip should bring about the
most important thing that had ever happened to her!</p>

<p>After the concert Paul Auerbach, in his old-fashioned dress coat
and white lawn tie, came up to her. "I am going back to the
artists' room, Lucy. Would you like to go with me?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. "No, thank you, Mr. Auerbach. I'd rather not.
Will he really expect me tomorrow, do you think?"</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>The next morning Lucy was walking across the city toward
Michigan Avenue. She was happy, she was frightened,&mdash;couldn't
keep her attention on anything. Her mind had got away from her and
was darting about in the sunlight, over the tops of the tall
buildings. Exactly at ten o'clock she went into the Arts Building
and told the hall porter she had an engagement with Mr. Sebastian.
He rang for the elevator, and she was taken up to the sixth storey.
When she lifted the brass knocker, Sebastian himself opened the
door.</p>

<p>"I was expecting you," he said with a nod. "I knew you were in
town, for I saw you in my audience last night, hiding behind a
pillar. Did you like the concert?" He took her coat from her and
hung it up. "Better take off your hat, too; you'll be more
comfortable."</p>

<p>The music room opened directly off the entry hall, with only a
doorway between. As she walked into it, Lucy noticed it was a big
room, full of sunlight, and that the general colour was dark red;
the rugs and curtains and chairs. The piano stood at the front,
between two windows.</p>

<p>Sebastian saw that she was not looking at anything; probably she
was frightened again.</p>

<p>"Shall we begin? We can talk afterwards. We'll work a little on
the Elijah. I have to go to St. Paul to sing it with an oratorio
society very soon, and I've not looked at it for a long while."</p>

<p>When she sat down at the piano, he put the music on the rack,
turning over the pages. "Before we begin with my part, we might run
through the tenor's aria, here. It's much too high for me, of
course, but I like to sing it." He pointed to the page and began:
"If with all your heart you truly seek Him."</p>

<p>"That's a nice introduction to the whole thing, isn't it? Now
we'll take it up just here," he leaned over her and indicated with
his finger.</p>

<p>He walked up and down in his elkskin shoes as he sang, his hands
in the pockets of his smoking-jacket. Lucy had no thought for
anything but the score in front of her. An hour and a half went by
very quickly. Just when she thought things were going better, he
put his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Enough for today, Miss Gayheart. Very good for a first trial.
Shall we begin at the same hour tomorrow? And don't become agitated
when you make mistakes. What I most want is elasticity. You must
learn to catch a hint quickly in the tempi. When I'm eccentric,
catch step with me. I have a reason, or think I have. Now suppose
we sit down over here by the fire and have a glass of port and a
biscuit. We've been working very hard."</p>

<p>She rose and went to the chair he pointed out. She suddenly felt
tired. Sebastian lowered the heavy window-shades a little, until
the sunshine fell only on the rugs and the brass fire-irons. He
brought a tray with a decanter and glasses and sat down opposite
her, lounging back in his chair with his feet to the fire.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard the Elijah well given, Miss Gayheart?"</p>

<p>Lucy told him she had never heard it given at all.</p>

<p>He smiled indulgently. "Mendelssohn is out of fashion just now.
Who is the fashion? Debussy, I suppose? You've noticed that people
are interested in music chiefly to have something to talk about at
dinner parties?"</p>

<p>Lucy murmured she couldn't say as to that; she didn't go to
dinner parties, and she didn't know anyone in Chicago except
Professor Auerbach and a few of his students.</p>

<p>"And in your own part of the country isn't it so?"</p>

<p>"I think my father is the only person in our town who is much
interested in music. He leads the town band and gives lessons on
the clarinet."</p>

<p>"Your father is a music-teacher?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. He's a watchmaker by trade, but he plays the
clarinet and flute very well, and the violin a little."</p>

<p>"German, of course? That's good. A German watchmaker who plays
the flute seems to me a comfortable sort of father to have."</p>

<p>He asked her how she happened to come to Chicago, and to study
with Auerbach. She felt that his questions were not perfunctory,
that he really wanted to know something about her life, and she got
over her shyness.</p>

<p>While they were talking, the outer door opened softly, and a
little man in a stiffly starched white jacket and noiseless tennis
shoes, carrying several coats on hangers, darted through the room
and disappeared into the sleeping-chamber beyond.</p>

<p>"That is Giuseppe, my valet," Sebastian explained. "Come in and
see how well he does for me." He opened the door and took Lucy into
his sleeping-room. "Giuseppe, this is the Signorina who is coming
to play for me until Mr. Mockford is better. I want her to see how
we live."</p>

<p>"Si, si, signore." Giuseppe smiled eagerly and stepped back from
the clothes-closet, pointing to the rows of coats and trousers very
much as if he were a guide in a picture gallery. When he thought
she had observed them sufficiently, he flourished his hand toward
the dressing-table and toward a bed of faultless contour.</p>

<p>"Yes, he keeps everything very neat. If you went through my
bureau drawers, you'd find them just like your own. He makes my
breakfast too, and brings it up to me."</p>

<p>Giuseppe stood holding his hands clasped in front of his
stomach, smiling like a little boy being praised. His face seemed
almost like a boy's. But his hair, Lucy noticed, was thin and
faded, and his high red forehead (shaped like a bowl) was seamed by
deep lines from left to right. A moment later, when he had gone to
the far end of the music room to put fresh coal on the fire, Lucy
asked Sebastian whether Giuseppe had been with him long.</p>

<p>"I picked him up in London, on the way over. He used to be valet
de chambre in an hotel in Florence. I've never had better service.
Think of it, he has got all those lines on his forehead worrying
about other people's coats and boots and breakfasts. I haven't a
friend in the world who would do for me what that little man
would."</p>

<p>Something in the way he said this made Lucy feel a trifle
downcast. She almost wished she were Giuseppe. After all, it was
people like that who counted with artists&mdash;more than their
admirers.</p>

<p>When she left the studio a few moments later she found the
Italian in the little entrance hall, before a table drawer which
was divided into compartments. Into these he was putting away
gloves; into one white gloves, into another tan, into another grey.
A man must be rich and successful indeed to live in such beautiful
order, she thought.</p>

<p>When she reached her own room after lunch, she looked about it
with affection and compassion. She pulled down the shades, opened
the window a little, and threw herself upon the bed, too tired to
sit up and too much excited to sleep. Things she had scarcely
noticed at the time came rushing through her mind: the
dressing-gown thrown on a chair, the silver on the dressing-table,
the spongy softness of the rose-coloured blankets the valet was
smoothing on the bed, and those gloves in the table drawer.
Evidently nothing ever came near Sebastian to tarnish his personal
elegance. She had never known a man who lived like that.</p>

<p>Harry Gordon was rich, to be sure; he owned carriages and
blooded horses, sleighs and guns, and he had his clothes made in
Chicago. But his things stood out, and weren't a part of himself.
His overcoats were harsh to touch, his hats were stiff. He was
crude, like everyone else she knew. An upstanding young man, they
called him at home, easy and masterful in his own town, but in a
big city he took on a certain self-importance, as if he were afraid
of being ignored in the crowd. She remembered just how Sebastian
looked when he stood against the light in his heelless shoes and
old velvet jacket. He would be equal to any situation in the world.
He had a simplicity that must come from having lived a great deal
and mastered a great deal. If you brushed against his life ever so
lightly it was like tapping on a deep bell; you felt all that you
could not hear.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>It was settled that, for the present, Lucy should go to the
studio every day when Sebastian was in town. In the morning she
awoke with such lightness of heart that it seemed to her she had
been drifting on a golden cloud all night. After she had lain still
for a few moments to feel the physical pleasure of coming up out of
sleep, she would run down a cold hallway and take her bath before
the other occupants on her floor were stirring. When she entered
the bakery downstairs, the savour of coffee was delightful to her.
Mrs. Schneff served the early comers herself, in a blue gingham
dress and a white apron. She asked Lucy "how come" she ate more
breakfast now than she used to. Lucy laughed and told her she was
making more money now. "Dat is goot," said the plump bakeress
approvingly.</p>

<p>After breakfast Lucy went upstairs and put her room in order.
She could never make her bed look so high and smooth as Giuseppe's,
but that was because she had no box-springs, or blankets soft as
fur.</p>

<p>The weather was miraculous, for January. She always started very
early for Michigan Avenue, and had an hour or so to walk along the
Lake front before she went into the Arts Building. There was very
little ice in the water that January, and the blue floor of the
Lake, wrinkled with gold, seemed to be the day itself, stretching
before her unspent and beautiful. As she walked along, holding her
muff against her cheek on the wind side, it was hard to believe
there was anything in the world she could not have if she wanted
it. The sharp air that blew off the water brought up all the fire
of life in her; it was like drinking fire. She had to turn her back
to it to catch her breath.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock she went into the studio and brought the
freshness of the morning weather to a man who rose late and did not
go abroad until noon. She warmed her hands at the coal grate while
he finished his cigarette. If Sebastian had been slow in dressing,
Giuseppe answered her knock, his dust-cloth on his arm, and hung up
her coat, telling her that the maestro would be out subito, subito.
He called her Signorina Lucia. After she and Sebastian set to work,
Giuseppe went in to do the bedroom, leaving the door open a little
so that he could listen.</p>

<p>One morning when Sebastian finished singing "It is enough...I am
not better than my fathers," Lucy turned impulsively on her stool
to look at him. She never allowed herself to make any comment (she
knew he wouldn't like it), but often she had to make some bodily
movement to break the tension. There in the doorway of the
sleeping-chamber stood Giuseppe, his red hands crossed over his
stomach, his head inclined, his sharp face and quick little eyes
melted into repose and gravity. He caught up the laundry bag from
behind the door, and pausing just a moment on the ball of his foot,
looked Sebastian straight in the eye. "Ecco una cosa molto bella!"
he brought out in a husky voice, before he vanished through the
entry hall.</p>

<p>Lucy found she clung to Giuseppe as if he were a protector among
things that were new and strange. Several times she met him in the
street, going on errands in a grey overcoat much too long for him
and a hard felt hat. Or seeing her he would snatch off his hat, and
his face, his whole body, indeed, would express astonishment and
delight, as if it were wonderful, almost supernatural, that they
should encounter one another thus.</p>

<p>Her acquaintance with Giuseppe progressed rapidly, but with
Sebastian she seemed to get little further than on the first day.
He kept well behind his courteous, half-playful, and rather
professional manner,&mdash;a manner so perfected that it could go
on representing him when he himself was either lethargic or
altogether absent. His amiability puzzled Lucy, and rather
discouraged her.</p>

<p>When she used to see Sebastian by chance occasionally, on the
street or in the Park, his face seemed to her forbidding. Sometimes
she thought it stern and indifferent, but more than once it had
struck her as melancholy. In the studio there was none of that. He
met her with a smile, and throughout the morning was friendly and
affable. Yet she went away feeling that the other man, whom she
used to see secretly, was his real self.</p>

<p>Trivial, accidental things gradually broke down his reserve.
Once, as she was coming down the Lake side of Michigan Avenue, just
before she crossed to the Arts Building, she happened to glance up,
and saw Sebastian standing at an open window, looking down at her.
He leaned out a little and waved his hand. After that he was at the
window almost every morning. This made a difference in the way he
greeted her at the door; it was as if they had already met in the
street and were coming into the studio together. There was a keener
interest in his eyes when he took her hand, and he looked down into
her face as if she were bringing him something that pleased him. He
once told her so, indeed. She had just put her hat on the hall
table. He took it up, stroked the brown fur, and ran his
finger-tips along the slender, drooping red feather.</p>

<p>"You know, I like to see this little red feather coming down the
street. I watch for it, and should be terribly disappointed if it
didn't come. You seem to find walking in the cold the most
delightful thing imaginable. Montaigne says somewhere that in early
youth the joy of life lies in the feet. You recall that passage to
me, Lucy. I had forgotten it."</p>

<p>He often told her amusing stories. It was not a habit of his,
but he liked to hear her laugh. He never remarked upon this
(compliments, he believed, had a disastrous effect upon any
charming natural expression), but he provoked it for his own
pleasure. A beautiful laugh was rare, certainly; after she left him
he used to screw up his eyes and try to imitate it in his mind.
Nothing about her drew him to her so much as this purely
unconscious physical response.</p>

<p>Lucy knew more or less about Sebastian's outside life from his
telephone conversations. When she left the piano, he always made
her rest before she went out into the cold. He sat down and talked
to her, but they were very often interrupted by the
telephone,&mdash;the house operator put no calls through until
after eleven-thirty. Lucy could not help hearing his replies and
learning something about his engagements, his business affairs, who
his friends were. With women his talk was usually gentle and
soothing, as if the lady at the other end were in a flurry, or very
insistent. He told the most transparent lies in refusing
invitations, didn't seem to try to make them plausible. But he
always said something agreeable; asked to be remembered to the
lady's charming daughter, or thanked her for recommending a book
which he had liked very much. Every day his concert agent, Morris
Weisbourn, called him up as soon as his wire was open. Their talk
was usually very brief. But one morning when he answered
Weisbourn's call Lucy heard a sudden change in Sebastian's
voice.</p>

<p>"What's that, Morris? When did this letter come?...No, she wrote
me nothing about it. We don't discuss business matters in our
correspondence, that is what you are for...Send a draft for the
amount she mentions, and get it off today, not later...Of course I
can. Simply let the bills go over...Very well, then meet me at the
Auditorium for lunch, and I'll write a cheque for it."</p>

<p>When he came back from the telephone he lit another cigarette
and took up the story he had been telling her about his first
meeting with Debussy. But there was something bleak and unnatural
in his smile, and Lucy hurried away.</p>

<p>She knew, as well as if a name had been mentioned, that the
woman who had written for money was Mrs. Sebastian, and she thought
it a shame. He always spoke of his wife in a very chivalrous way,
and admiringly. She had heard him explain over the telephone, to a
friend just arrived from the Orient, that Mrs. Sebastian was not
with him because she dreaded the Chicago winter climate. When he
happened to tell Lucy about something he and his wife had done or
seen, he seemed to recall it with pleasure, became animated and
gay. But she felt sure that things were not like that with them
now. Perhaps this was why he was unhappy.</p>

<p>His manner, when she was with him, was that of a man who has an
easy, if somewhat tolerant, enjoyment of life. Some of the people
who telephoned him he seemed really fond of, and she knew that he
was attached to James Mockford, "one of the few friends who have
lasted through time and change," as he once remarked. But he seemed
very careful never to come too close to people. She believed he was
disappointed in something&mdash;or in everything.</p>

<p>She had been playing for him nearly three weeks, when quite by
accident she saw again that side of him which his genial manner
usually covered. One evening Giuseppe knocked at her door, bringing
a note from Sebastian. He would not be at the studio tomorrow
morning, as he had to attend the funeral services of a friend.</p>

<p>Lucy looked through the evening paper and found that Madame
Renee de Vignon, a French singer, returning from California, had
died in her hotel last night after an illness of only twenty-four
hours. There would be a funeral service for her at eleven o'clock
in the small Catholic church near her hotel. Afterwards her body
would be sent back to France.</p>

<p>The next morning, a little before the hour announced, Lucy stole
into the church. There were not a great many people there, and in
the dusky light she easily found Sebastian. He was kneeling, with
his hand over his face. When the organ began to play softly, and
the doors were opened and held back to admit the pallbearers, he
lifted his head and turned in his seat to face the coffin, carried
into the church on the shoulders of six men. A company of priests
and censer-bearers went with it up the aisle toward the altar. As
it moved forward, Sebastian's eyes never left it; turning his head
slowly, he followed it with a look that struck a chill to Lucy's
heart. It was a terrible look; anguish and despair, and something
like entreaty. All faces were turned reverently toward the
procession, but his stood out from the rest with a feeling personal
and passionate. He had forgotten himself, forgotten where he was
and that there were people who might stare at him. It seemed to
Lucy that a wave of black despair had swept into the church,
carrying him and that black coffin up the aisle together, while the
clergy and worshippers were unconscious of it. Had this woman been
a very dear friend? Or was it death itself that seemed horrible to
him&mdash;death in a foreign land, in a hotel, far from everything
one loved?</p>

<p>During the service he remained kneeling. From time to time he
drew out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead, but he did not lift
his face or his broad black shoulders until the coffin was carried
back toward the door. As it passed him, he gave it one long, dull
look, out of half-closed eyes. He was among the first to leave the
church. When Lucy reached the steps outside, she could see him far
down the street, walking rapidly, his back straight and stiff.</p>

<p>Once before, in November (how long ago it seemed!), she had seen
him coming out of a church, the Cathedral, when she happened to be
passing. He merely came out of the door, down the steps, and turned
straight north, without looking about for a cab as he usually did.
She felt sure, by the look on his face, that he was coming from
some religious observance. She went into the Cathedral; there was
no service going on, there were not a dozen people in the building;
but she knew that he had been there with a purpose that had to do
with the needs of his soul.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>Usually Sebastian and Mockford went out of town at the end of
the week to give a recital somewhere. Sebastian often telephoned
the young man, making appointments for the evening or afternoon,
but Mockford never dropped in upon them in the morning, and Lucy
was glad of it. She had never met him, or seen him except on the
concert stage. One morning when Sebastian handed her some songs
from Die Winterreise and asked her to look them over, she sighed
and shook her head.</p>

<p>"It won't be much use, I'm afraid. After hearing Mr. Mockford
play them, I think the best I can do is just to read them off."</p>

<p>Sebastian laughed. "Jimmy is a little genius with those, isn't
he? I doubt if Schubert ever heard them played so well. In his
mind, perhaps. Jimmy's not especially good with Mozart or the
Italian composers; but in the true German Lieder, whatever he does
seems to be right. I've got a great many hints from him."</p>

<p>On the day Sebastian was to leave for his concert engagements in
Minnesota and Wisconsin, Lucy went to the studio to tell him
good-bye. It was Mockford who opened the door for her and asked her
to come in. She drew back and would have run away if she could.</p>

<p>"No, come in, Miss Gayheart. It is Miss Gayheart, isn't it?
Clement has gone down to Allston's studio for a moment. Please
allow me." He took her coat, waited for her to go into the music
room, and limped in after her.</p>

<p>While he was pulling up a chair for her and poking the coal
fire, she saw him by daylight for the first time. She had thought
of him as a very young man, a youth, indeed. This morning he did
not seem young, but wiry and rather hard. Even his white skin
looked harder, somewhat rubbery, and there was a yellow glint in it
where the razor had not bit close. His copper-red hair fitted his
head so snugly that it might have been a well-made wig.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to meet you, Miss Gayheart. Glad to have an
opportunity to thank you for filling in." He sat down and looked at
Lucy, looked her over deliberately, and she looked at him. When
they had met at the door, the light was behind him and she could
not see his eyes. They might be called hazel, perhaps, but this
morning they were frankly green; a cool, sparkling green, with
something restless in them. He was the first to break down in the
searching look they gave each other. He rose quickly and softly and
lowered the window-shades a little. On the way back to his chair,
he began talking:</p>

<p>"I'm very upset to be fussing with doctors and dropping out like
this. Neither of us had looked forward to this American season with
much pleasure. However, he seems to be getting on very well with
you."</p>

<p>"I don't know as to that. I've no experience. I do the best I
can." Lucy could not tell whether he meant to be patronizing, or
whether he was merely ill at ease. She felt that he had disliked
her instantly, as she had him.</p>

<p>"Oh, he rather fancies breaking in a new person. The difficulty
is that Clement can never work with anyone who isn't personally
sympathetic to him. The odds are always against our being able to
pick up one of that sort on short notice."</p>

<p>Lucy flushed, but said nothing. She was looking at his white,
freckled hands, lying on the red velvet arms of the chair. The
fingers were square and unusually short for a pianist, but the
breadth of palm was remarkable.</p>

<p>"He gives a good account of you"&mdash;Mockford shot her a green
glance&mdash;"and since you do get on, it may be a good thing for
him&mdash;a change. He doesn't find much to divert him here. The
truth is, he's bored to death. I wasn't for his coming over at all.
But he needs the money. And he'd be bored anywhere just now. It's
only fair to say that you're not hearing the artist we know at home
and on the Continent."</p>

<p>"You have been with him a long while, Mr. Mockford?"</p>

<p>"Yes, off and on, a long while," he said carelessly. "There have
been interregnums. Mrs. Sebastian takes a fancy to a new pianist
now and then, and Clement tries him out. So far they've not been
altogether satisfactory."</p>

<p>"She is musical then, Mrs. Sebastian?"</p>

<p>"Oh, naturally! She is one of Sir Robert Lester's daughters." He
glanced at Lucy to see whether this enlightened her. It did not, so
he murmured: "He was one of our best conductors. The pianist has to
make it go with her as well as with Clement, if you mean that."</p>

<p>Lucy coloured again. "No, I did not mean that. I only wanted to
know if she is much interested in&mdash;in that side of him."</p>

<p>"In all sides, I should say. She was accustomed to direct things
in her father's household. It becomes her very well." He wrinkled
up his short nose and squinted as if a strong light had been
flashed in his face.</p>

<p>There was a kind of fascination about Mockford, Lucy thought. He
looked as if he were made up for the stage, yet there he sat in
perfectly conventional clothes, except for a green silk shirt and
green necktie. He couldn't help looking theatrical; he was made so,
and she couldn't tell whether or not he liked being unusual. His
manner was a baffling mixture of timidity and cheek. One thing was
clear; he was uncomfortable in her company, and certainly she was
in his. She was about to rise when she heard a fumbling at the
door. It was not Sebastian, however, but the hall porter, with the
railway tickets. He gave them to Mockford, told him at what hour
their train left, and just when he would have a cab downstairs for
them.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone, Lucy rose and said she couldn't wait.
She wished them both a pleasant journey, and would Mr. Sebastian
please let her know if he needed her again?</p>

<p>"He will telegraph you, doubtless. We shall be gone eight days
or more; two oratorios and three recitals. He'll be disappointed at
missing you, but he's very apt to forget engagements."</p>

<p>Lucy went down in the elevator, wondering whether she would ever
go up in it again.</p>

<p>She had dreaded meeting Mockford, but she couldn't have imagined
that such a meeting would break her courage and hurt her feelings.
She fiercely resented his having any opinions about her or her
connection with Sebastian. This was the first time a third person
had in any way come upon their little scene, and she hated it. So
they had talked her over. Natural perhaps, but it hurt her, all the
same. There was something else that disturbed her. She felt that
this strange man who was neither young nor old, who was picturesque
and a little repelling, was not altogether trustworthy. If she had
encouraged him, he would have talked to her too freely about Mrs.
Sebastian, and he spoke of Sebastian in a tone that was
objectionably familiar. He struck her as terribly selfish and vain,
and jealous of the man he called "Clement." She wished she could
get his white face out of her mind.</p>

<p>As she hurried along the street, she thought of one mistake
after another. Mockford had made her see her position as an
outsider must see it. He had made her feel that an inexperienced
country girl, with no education, shouldn't be trying to do his work
for him.</p>

<p>Why, then, hadn't they got a professional accompanist? There
were plenty of them in Chicago. It was a farce, that she should be
playing for Sebastian; just how had she ever got in for it? She had
gone to his studio the first time because she was asked to come;
she loved being there, and went again and again. He had seemed
pleased and amused, and was very kind. She even felt that he liked
her being young and ignorant and not too clever. It was an
accidental relationship, between someone who had everything and
someone who had nothing at all; and it concerned nobody else. She
had dropped down into the middle of this man's life, and she
snatched what she could, from the present and the past. Her playing
for him was nothing but make-believe; and his friendliness was
make-believe, perhaps. Then there was nothing real about
it,&mdash;except her own feeling. That was real.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>That afternoon Lucy had to give two lessons at Auerbach's
studio. While she was there the weather changed and a sullen winter
rain set in. She was used to walking home in the rain; she left the
studio and set off in the right direction. But after a while she
found herself facing east instead of west, and very soon she was on
the far side of Michigan Avenue. She walked up and down opposite
the Arts Building, watching the lights in Sebastian's windows.
After a time the windows went dark. She saw the hall porter carry
out a steamer trunk on his shoulder and strap it on the back of a
cab. Sebastian and Mockford followed him and stood talking under
the awning while the bags were brought down. Then Sebastian tipped
the porter and the bag boy, shepherded the lame man into the cab,
got in after him, and drove away. Lucy felt discouraged and alone
in the world.</p>

<p>She went slowly across the town, getting a kind of comfort out
of the crowded streets and the people who rushed by and bumped into
her, hurrying away from the rain. In the city you had plenty of
room to be lonely, no one noticed, she reflected. And if you were
burning yourself up, so was everyone else; you weren't smouldering
alone on the edge of the prairie. She thought she had never before
seen so many sad and discouraged people. Tramps, wet as the horses,
stood in the empty doorways for shelter. She passed an old man
steaming himself in the vapour that rose from an iron grating in
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Usually Lucy went through these streets with her mind racing
ahead of her, like a little boy following a balloon, not minding
the cold for herself or for anyone else. But tonight all these
people seemed like companions, and she felt a kind of humble
affection for them.</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p>Sebastian had been away nine days, and Lucy began to wonder
whether he would ever need her again. He had sent her a cheque,
without any word, in a note written to Auerbach. It was much too
large, and made her feel as if she were being paid off. She hadn't
cashed it; it lay in her top bureau drawer.</p>

<p>She had been very busy; had managed to get in four lessons with
Auerbach, besides giving the usual time to her pupils, and she had
practised resolutely. But her heart was not in it. Probably he had
found a pianist who suited him better, or perhaps James Mockford
felt well enough to take up his work again. That day at the studio,
when Mockford was standing behind her holding her coat, she had
happened to glance at the mirror over the table and caught a
strange smile flickering over his face; as if he had a safe card up
his sleeve.</p>

<p>On the tenth morning of Sebastian's absence Lucy awoke late
because the room was dark. It was storming outside, and there was a
snowdrift on her floor beneath the open window. She put on her
dressing-gown, swept up the snow with a whisk-broom and a
newspaper, turned on the heat, and got back into bed to wait until
the room was warm. As she lay there thinking of nothing in
particular, she was startled by a knock on her door, and a boy's
voice called: "Western Union!"</p>

<p>When the rubber-caped boy was gone, Lucy stood looking at the
yellow envelope before she tore it open. She felt sure that it was
from Sebastian, and it happened to be the first telegram she had
ever received in her life.</p>

<blockquote>Hope you can be at the studio Thursday morning usual
hour. Greetings.<br>
<br>
Sebastian</blockquote>

<p>Thursday; that was tomorrow. Lucy stuck the telegram in her
mirror and hurriedly began to dress. She was thinking that years
from now, when she would probably be teaching piano to the
neighbours' children in Haverford, nothing would recall this part
of her life so vividly, or make it seem so real, as that slip of
paper.</p>

<p>When she went down to the bakery Mrs. Schneff greeted her with a
broad smile. "You eat a good breakfast today, I expect? The
telegraph boy come in here to inquire, but I see you ain't got no
bad news anyway."</p>

<p>No, Lucy told her, it was something pleasant.</p>

<p>"Dat's good. Now you eat a good breakfast. I don't like to see
you git worried like." She wiped off a table with her apron, and
spread a clean napkin over it.</p>

<p>A little later Lucy put on her high overshoes and hurried to the
bank to cash her cheque. Then she went to a department store and
bought a new dress for the studio, a pretty one, with a silk blouse
and embroidered jacket. As she walked home, carrying her parcels
with her, she stopped at a flower shop and got a bunch of
violets.</p>

<p>She spent the afternoon putting her clothes and bureau drawers
in order. At four o'clock she went over to Auerbach's studio to
give a lesson. When she came back, her room was almost dark; the
air was fresh from the window she had left a little open, and full
of the smell of violets. Like spring, it was, to one coming in out
of the wintry streets. She sat down in the dusk before the grey
square of window-glass to rest.</p>

<p>Yesterday she had been like someone waiting in a doctor's
office; it was not living, it was time passing. There was a strange
heaviness under whatever she did, as if she had swallowed lead.
Today everything was soft, tranquil. There was a kindness in the
air one breathed. Everyone in the shops had seemed kind. Life ought
always to be like this.</p>

<p>Presently, when even the square of window was dark, she lit the
gas and sat down at the piano, beginning to play over some songs
from Die schone Mullerin, which Sebastian had been practising
before he left. She was thinking that he must be already on his way
home, settled in his stateroom and rushing through the great snowy
country up there...full of forests and lakes, she had heard
tell.</p>

<h3>10</h3>

<p>The city was very sloppy on the morning after the snow-storm,
and Lucy did not take her usual walk along the Lake; she was afraid
of splashing her new dress. She went straight to the Arts Building.
How glad she was to greet the hall porter, and to step into the
elevator once more!</p>

<p>"I haven't bothered you for some time, have I, George? Mr.
Sebastian is home again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss. He got in early yesterday morning."</p>

<p>Lucy was astonished. He got back yesterday? Why, the telegram
had come yesterday, saying he would arrive today&mdash;but no, the
message didn't really say that, she remembered. He must have sent
it just before he got on the train at St. Paul. She hadn't noticed
the date. How strange, when he could have sent her word from this
building yesterday! However, that was probably his way of doing
things,&mdash;and she was already at the studio door.</p>

<p>Sebastian opened it, in his elkskins and short jacket as usual,
but he looked younger and fresher than when he went away. He
laughed as she came in, and dropped both hands lightly on her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"And here she is! Let me have a look at you, and tell me whether
you have been a good girl all this while. A new dress, too; such a
pretty one!"</p>

<p>While he detained her in the entry hall, she vaguely noticed a
heavy fragrance of fresh flowers in the air. Going into the music
room, she saw that the tea table had been moved from its usual
place beside the coal grate, and on it stood a large
primrose-tinted vase, full of cream-coloured roses and heavy,
drooping sprays of acacia. She exclaimed and stopped to look at
them on her way to the piano. They were rich and opulent beyond
anything she had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Yes, a kind lady, an old friend, stopped over in Chicago
yesterday and called on me. This morning, on her way to the train,
she brought me those, just as they are."</p>

<p>Lucy had never seen mimosa except in florists' windows, and she
lingered over it; it seemed like a whole garden from the South. "I
think that lady must have been a sweetheart," she murmured.</p>

<p>Sebastian smiled. "Perhaps. And perhaps she remembers things as
sweeter than they were. That often happens. And it's a mercy, too!"
He was arranging the music for her. "We will begin Die schone
Mullerin and go straight along until we are tired. I feel like work
this morning."</p>

<p>She thought she had never heard him sing so beautifully, but she
was much too timid to say so. He went through the cycle before he
stopped. Then he brought out his bottle of port and they sat down
before the fire. He began to tell her about his concerts in the
North, and said he liked engagements with singing societies.</p>

<p>"Many singers don't, you know. But I always feel such a
friendliness in the people of the chorus; and I like them,
especially when they sing well. In Minneapolis the sopranos were
very good. The basses, too; most of them Germans and Swedes. The
people in choral societies really get something out of music,
something to help them through their lives, not something to talk
about. Plumbers and brewers and bank clerks and dressmakers, they
wouldn't be there unless it meant something; it cuts one night out
of their week all winter."</p>

<p>Just then he was called to the telephone to speak with his
agent. When he came back, Lucy was again bending over the flowers.
He picked up the vase and stood holding it between himself and the
light.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're nice, aren't they? Very suggestive: youth, love,
hope&mdash;all the things that pass." He turned around to the fire
and took up the cigarette he had left on the mantel.</p>

<p>In that moment while he seemed absent-minded Lucy slipped into
the hall and put on her coat and hat. She came back to say
good-bye. He was still standing by the grate, smoking, more
approachable than usual; but when he took her hand he was clearly
thinking about something else.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sebastian," she asked him, her face breaking into a smile,
"didn't you ever get any pleasure out of being in love?"</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly, frowned with his brows and smiled with
his lips. "N-n-no, not much." Then turning to find an ash-tray, he
said mischievously: "Why?&mdash;Do you?"</p>

<p>Lucy found herself at the door with her hand on the knob. She
wanted nothing so much as to be outside, but for some reason she
stopped and turned to face him, without seeing him at all.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. And nobody can spoil it."</p>

<p>She could hear her own voice, small and cracked because there
was no breath behind it. Once outside the door she did not ring for
the elevator, but ran down the five flights of stairs as fast as
she could.</p>

<p>When she was a little girl she used to run away after she had
been scolded, along the country road that led toward the Platte,
faster and faster, as if she could leave hurt feelings behind. Now
in the same way she went hurrying across the city, splashing the
new dress she had meant to take care of. She was crying, and she
did not care who saw her. She would never go back to the studio. If
she couldn't keep her feelings to herself, she must stay away. All
the same, it was heartless of him to make fun of her; it was just
the kind of thing she would never have expected of him. He had been
seeing a woman who was rich and beautiful and cultivated, who had
everything that she had not. His spirits were high, and his vanity
had been flattered; he found Lucy Gayheart amusing. The moment she
saw those flowers she had felt a sudden uneasiness, and a vague
envy of the unknown person who had a right to send him roses worth
their weight in gold. Until today she could not have imagined that
he would ever be unkind to her; indifferent, perhaps, but not
unkind. Moreover, he was mistaken. She didn't care for him in that
way. She didn't want anything from him; she didn't even want him to
be too much aware of her. Why had he said that?</p>

<p>When Lucy was almost home she suddenly stopped and stood still,
looked down into the mud with intense amazement on her face. It was
quite possible that he had not meant at all what she thought! What
did he know about her life, after all? He might easily take it for
granted that she had a sweetheart among the students. She was
pretty, at an age when it is quite natural to be in love. Older men
often teased young girls in that way as a compliment. Her shoulders
relaxed, and she walked on slowly.</p>

<p>Then perhaps everything was all right, or would be but for that
stupid speech she had made at the door. Oh, why had she exposed her
wound and her anger! How often Pauline had told her that one day
she would come to grief from blurting out everything she felt.</p>

<p>She had not been in her own room half an hour when a messenger
boy came with a telegram. He said the answer was prepaid, and he
must wait for it. She tore open the envelope with a feeling of
dread. It was from Sebastian, asking whether she could meet him for
tea at the Auditorium at five o'clock. He added the word
"important."</p>

<p>She couldn't, just then, bear the thought of seeing him.
Fortunately, she had a sound reason for refusing. She wrote a
truthful answer.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, but I have to give a lesson for Professor Auerbach
at five."</p>

<p>She did not want to sign her name, but the messenger boy
insisted that it was necessary. After he was gone, she looked from
the yellow sheet in her hand to the other telegram on her dresser,
which had come only yesterday. What had happened in the meantime?
She gave it up; she was too tired to think. Let chance take its
way. She lay down and slept for nearly two hours. When she got up
at four o'clock to go to Auerbach's studio she was quite herself
again.</p>

<p>Lucy kept her pupil longer than usual that afternoon. Mr.
Auerbach came to the door and asked her to stop at his study before
she left the building. When she went there, she found Clement
Sebastian seated by Auerbach's desk, talking to him. He rose as she
entered and held out his hand. He said he wanted to see her about
tomorrow's work, and as she had no telephone he had thought he
might reach her through Auerbach. "I have a cab waiting outside, so
I may as well take you home, we can talk on the way. And now I
shall find where this young lady lives, Paul. To me her number
indicates the middle of the Chicago River."</p>

<p>When they were seated in the cab he came to the point at
once.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, whatever did you mean by flying off like that
this morning? One is always saying things of that sort to young
people. It's not in very good taste, perhaps, but it's customary,
and we've grown used to it&mdash;surely <i>you</i> must be used to
it! Why were you so annoyed?"</p>

<p>Lucy looked out of the carriage window. She found it rather
difficult to explain.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mr. Sebastian. I felt ashamed afterwards. I think
it must have been something in the way you said it. I was startled.
Please never think of it again. I know you didn't mean anything
unkind."</p>

<p>"Unkind? Lucy, my dear! Come, we must trust each other more than
that. We mustn't have little clouds creeping over our mornings. We
can't afford it. Sailing dates come soon enough, and then we'll be
sorry."</p>

<p>As they turned a corner the green lights of the bakery windows
came into view. In a moment the cab stopped.</p>

<p>"So this is where you live! If you won't come over to me for
tea, I shall come here and have coffee with you. A very substantial
place it looks." He accompanied her to the foot of the
linoleum-covered wooden stairs and stood for a moment, holding his
hat in his hand and smiling down into her face. His eyes still had
that livelier look she had noticed in the morning. "Till tomorrow,
then? And I'll be as solemn as an owl. No joking with Lucy!"</p>

<p>The next morning it was Giuseppe who opened the door for her,
beaming and rapidly exploding into speech. By this time she could
understand him pretty well. Sebastian had given her an Italian
grammar one day, and told her she might as well pick up what she
could. Giuseppe explained that Sebastian had been called upstairs
to see Signor Cunningham, who was ill, but would return in a
moment. Meanwhile she must sit down and get warm. He dropped on his
knees and began blowing the fire. Then he went on with his dusting,
telling her all the while what good fortune it was for her, so
young, to work with a great artist like Sebastian. Education was
everything in this world; if his father had been able to send him
to school, he would not now fare il cameriere. For the first time
it occurred to Lucy that even this smiling little man might have
his regrets. And had he, in his uncanny way, sensed that something
went wrong yesterday?</p>

<h3>11</h3>

<p>One Sunday afternoon near the end of February Lucy was sitting
in her room looking out at the back of the next building, which
came close to her window,&mdash;a blank wall of bricks painted
grey. Sunday was the only day in which she had much time for
reflection. She gave lessons all day on Saturday, but on Sunday she
was free.</p>

<p>This morning she was wondering how a month, nearly two months,
indeed, could have slipped by so quickly. A strange kind of life
she had been leading. For two hours, five days of the week, she was
alone with Sebastian, shut away from the rest of the world. It was
as if they were on the lonely spur of a mountain, enveloped by
mist. They saw no one but Giuseppe, heard no one; the city below
was blotted out. Then, after eleven-thirty, the city began poking
in its fingers. The telephone began to buzz, and she heard him
build up the rest of his day and his evening. At about twelve she
got into the elevator and dropped down into Chicago again.</p>

<p>The weather, which everyone grumbled about, had been exactly the
right weather for her. The dark, stormy mornings made the warmth
and quiet toward which she hurried seem all the richer. The dirty
streets, as she crossed the town through sleet and snow, were like
narrow rivers, shut in by grey cliffs where the light was always
changing, and she herself was a twig or a leaf swept along on the
current. As soon as she reached the studio, that excitement and
sense of struggle vanished; her mind was like a pair of dancing
balances brought to rest. Something quieted her like a great
natural force. Things took on their right relation, the trivial and
disturbing shut out. Life was resolved into something simple and
noble&mdash;yes, and joyous; a joyousness which seemed safe from
time or change, like that in Schubert's Die Forelle, which
Sebastian often sang.</p>

<p>Lucy stopped looking at the streaks of rain against the grey
wall, went to her shabby piano, and played that song again and
again. There were other songs which she associated more closely
with Sebastian himself, but this one was like the studio, like the
hours they spent there together. No matter where in the world she
should ever hear it, it would always drop her down again into that
room with the piano between two big windows, the coal fire glowing
behind her, the Lake reaching out before her, and the man walking
carelessly up and down as he sang.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>On this same Sunday Sebastian himself was going through a bad
time. He happened to have no out-of-town engagement, so he was in
Chicago, in his studio. This day, with a brutal rain beating on
brutal buildings, had been one of slowly rising misery.</p>

<p>In the morning paper he had read a dispatch from Geneva,
announcing the death of an old friend and fellow student, at a
sanatorium in Savoy. He hadn't even known that Larry MacGowan was
ill; there had been a coldness between them for the last few years.
But the moment his eyes fell on that black headline the feeling of
estrangement vanished as if it had never been. The reality was
their ardent, generous young friendship, their student days
together&mdash;which were only yesterday, after all. He put down
the newspaper softly, as if he were afraid of wakening someone. It
was like reading his own death notice. Like it? It was just that.
The obituary would serve for both&mdash;for their good days.</p>

<p>Nothing had ever made Sebastian admit to himself that his youth
was forever and irrevocably gone. He had clung to a secret belief
that he would pick it up again, somewhere. This was a time of
temporary lassitude and disillusion, but his old feeling about life
would come back; he would turn a corner and confront it. He would
waken some morning and step out of bed the man he used to be. Now,
all in a moment, it came over him that when people spoke of their
dead youth they were not using a figure of speech. The thing he was
looking for had gone out into the wide air, like a volatile
essence, and he was staring into the empty jar. Emptiness, that was
the feeling: the very objects in his studio seemed to draw farther
apart, and to regard each other more coldly. MacGowan had slipped
out of all this; grey skies, falling rain, chilled affections.
Everything in this room, in this city and this country, had
suddenly become unfamiliar and unfriendly.</p>

<p>The lid once off, he began remembering everything, and
everything seemed to have gone wrong. Life had so turned out that
now, when he was nearing fifty, he was without a country, without a
home, without a family, and very nearly without friends. Surely a
man couldn't congratulate himself upon a career which had led to
such results. He had missed the deepest of all companionships, a
relation with the earth itself, with a countryside and a people.
That relationship, he knew, cannot be gone after and found; it must
be long and deliberate, unconscious. It must, indeed, be a way of
living. Well, he had missed it, whatever it was, and he had begun
to believe it the most satisfying tie men can have. Friendships?
Larry was the man he had cared for most. Among women? There was
little for sweet reflection in that chapter. He had married the
woman he loved, and for years they had been happy; now they were
both better off when they had the Atlantic between them. The thing
which had estranged them was not at all the conventional situation
supposed to arise between an artist and his wife. It was jealousy,
perhaps, but not of the usual sort.</p>

<p>As they had no children, Sebastian had taken into their house a
talented boy, almost a child when he came, who had no home and no
parents; the orphan of a couple who had both sung at the Opera
Comique. He was a charming boy, and devoted to Madame Sebastian.
But she had taken a strong dislike to him and treated him harshly.
The lad was sensitive, and so adoring of her that her severity
amounted to cruelty. After a year and a half Sebastian could endure
the situation no longer, and sent Marius away to a good school. But
this did not mend matters; he had seen a side of his wife's nature
which he had never before suspected; it had changed his feeling for
her. She sensed this, and was bitter. He missed the boy and used to
go into Paris to see him; even this she resented. He came to
America, to Chicago, where he was born, though he had left it at
eighteen and had lived abroad most of the time since.</p>

<p>Sebastian had been sitting by the fire for hours. He had smoked
until his throat was dry, and his thoughts had wandered over a
great part of the surface of the earth. He had dragged the bottom,
and brought up nothing worth remembering. His mind could not find a
comfortable position to lie in. He remembered Macbeth's, Oh, full
of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Wasn't there one lovely,
unspoiled memory?&mdash;In the present wasn't there somewhere a
flower or a green bough that he could hold close and breathe its
freshness? His glance wandered toward the piano; perhaps there was
one!</p>

<p>Sebastian got up and opened the windows wide, wound a scarf
about his throat, and walked up and down the room while the wind
blew out the tobacco smoke. He was thinking about Lucy; that
perhaps he wouldn't have got so far down this morning if she had
been there for an hour. It was dangerous to go for sympathy to a
young girl who was in love with one, but Lucy was different. As he
paced back and forth he told himself that hers was quite another
kind of feeling than the one he had encountered under so many
disguises. It seemed complete in itself, not putting out tentacles
all the while. He had sometimes thought of her as rather boyish,
because she was so square. It was more like a chivalrous loyalty
than a young passion. He didn't believe she would ever be guilty of
those uncatalogued, faint treacheries which vanity makes young
people commit. He didn't believe she would ever use his name for
her own advantage&mdash;not even in a harmless way, to make herself
interesting to a crowd of students, for instance. That was a good
deal to say for a young thing with her living to make, struggling
to get a foothold in a slippery world. He hadn't met with just that
kind of delicacy before, in man or woman. When she gave him a quick
shy look and the gold sparks flashed in her eyes, he read devotion
there, and the fire of imagination; but no invitation, no appeal.
In her companionship there was never the shadow of a claim. On the
contrary, there was a spirit which disdained advantage.</p>

<p>He suddenly noticed that the place had grown very cold. His
watch said five o'clock; he must have been on his feet for nearly
an hour. The air of the room had freshened, and something within
him had freshened. The contraction in his chest, the bitter taste
in his mouth were gone. He shut the windows and went into his
bedroom to change his clothes. In a quarter of an hour he came out
in a dinner jacket and put on his overcoat. Downstairs he hailed
the first cab he saw and gave the driver Lucy's number.</p>

<p>When he got out before the bakery he told the cabman to wait.
First he glanced into the restaurant, thinking she might already
have come down for her supper. Then he went up the two flights of
stairs. He would not have known at which door to knock, but behind
one of them he heard a piano with a bad tone; Die Forelle. He
smiled, and when she had finished he knocked gently.</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"It's Sebastian, Miss Gayheart. May I see you for a moment?"</p>

<p>Lucy glanced despairingly about the room; but it was dark, he
couldn't see anything. She pulled her dressing-gown tight and
opened the door a little way.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't bother you on Sunday, should I? But won't you come
out to dinner with me tonight, if you've no other engagement? I've
had a melancholy day, and I dread dining alone."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, Mr. Sebastian. I'll have to dress, but it won't
take long."</p>

<p>"Don't hurry, take all the time you want. It's still very early.
I'll wait for you downstairs in the cab. And I'll go into the
bakery and buy a bun, so the good woman can see that you are
driving off with a staid, respectable person."</p>

<p>Lucy shut the door and lit the gas. She had only the same old
evening dress, the black net she had worn to all his concerts.
However, she told herself, if it was well-dressed women he wished
to dine with, there were plenty he could ask. He must know she
hadn't any clothes, and if he didn't mind, she didn't.&mdash;But
she would have given a great deal to have a new dress to put on for
him.</p>

<p>When they went into the hotel dining-room she was glad to find
that it was nearly empty; he wouldn't have to conduct a shabby girl
through a roomful of smart people. While they were waiting for the
soup he smiled for the first time.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I startled you, turning up uninvited like that. I've
been sticking in the studio all day. Did you happen to notice in
the morning paper that Larry MacGowan died yesterday in a
sanatorium in Savoy? We were the closest of friends, long ago. We
were students together."</p>

<p>The day of Madame de Vignon's funeral flashed up in Lucy's mind.
She could only murmur that she was sorry he had had bad news.</p>

<p>"And I am sorry in the wrong way. I am sorry for myself. Years
ago if I had seen that thing in brutal type, I would have lain down
and cried like a boy. Things happen to our friendships; that's the
worst about living. Young people can't know what it means."</p>

<p>The waiter came with the soup and wine. When he was gone,
Sebastian began to talk again.</p>

<p>"We had drifted apart, and for no good reason. Five years ago he
came to visit me in France. My wife and I had been having our
little place at Chantilly done over, and we were very pleased with
it. I had looked forward to Larry's visit, but it didn't turn out
well. He didn't like our house or our servants or our friends, or
anything else. He showed it plainly, and I was disappointed and
piqued. Our parting was cold. I think he must have been breaking up
even then. He was difficult about everything, and he made
criticisms that hurt one's feelings."</p>

<p>"Did you never see him afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Never. Other troubles came along, soon enough. We exchanged a
few letters, the kind which mean nothing. The dispatch said he died
in a sanatorium in the mountains above Sallanches. He and I took a
walking trip through that very country one summer when we were in
our early twenties. He must have recalled those days, when he was
ill up there. We used to lie down on the hillsides and look up at
those mountains, with our knapsacks under our heads, for hours
together. We always got up very early and went out on our balconies
before sunrise, while the light was changing on the peaks, and
called good-morning to each other. I can't help wondering why he
didn't wish to see me again. Why didn't he send for me last summer,
I wonder?"</p>

<p>Sebastian drank a good deal of wine, and he told Lucy more about
his own life than he had ever done before: how he had met Larry
MacGowan on the steamer when he first left Chicago and was on his
way abroad to study. He soon found that MacGowan also was going
over to study, and under the same master. When they landed at
Cherbourg they were already friends. They took a studio together in
Paris and lived at the same pension.</p>

<p>Sebastian lingered a long while over his dinner. The dining-room
was almost empty when they at last left it and took a cab for
Lucy's part of the town. He slipped his arm through hers and
pressed her hand gratefully. "You were kind to give me this
evening, Lucy. I wanted to talk to someone; and I wanted it to be
you. No one else."</p>

<p>She turned to him quickly and caught his sleeve. "Oh, Mr.
Sebastian, I wish you didn't ever have to be sad! I am happy
whenever I think about you, and so are lots of people. You have
everything other people are struggling for. You don't value it
enough, truly you don't!" She stopped because she knew she was
talking foolishly.</p>

<p>Sebastian was listening not to what she said, but to the rush of
feeling in her warm young voice. There is no way to define that
ring of truth in a voice, he was thinking, and no mistaking it. He
took the hand on his sleeve and held it between both his own. "Do I
seem sad to you, Lucy? Everyone has disappointments. I'm sometimes
lonely over here. Not in the mornings, when we are working
together; then I feel quite like myself. That reminds me: tomorrow
morning I must spend with my agent. Perhaps you can come in at five
o'clock and have tea with me? I should like that."</p>

<p>The cab turned the corner, and the greenish-white lights in the
bakery windows came into view. Sebastian took her to the foot of
the stairway. "Remember," he said, "tomorrow is a holiday for you,
and you are to sleep late and dream of something very nice. Perhaps
you will dream that we are both twenty, and are taking a walking
trip in the French Alps. And I shall call to you at daybreak from
my balcony!"</p>

<h3>12</h3>

<p>The next afternoon Lucy was walking slowly over toward Michigan
Avenue. She had never loved the city so much; the city which gave
one the freedom to spend one's youth as one pleased, to have one's
secret, to choose one's master and serve him in one's own way.
Yesterday's rain had left a bitter, springlike smell in the air;
the vehemence that beat against her in the street and hummed above
her had something a little wistful in it tonight, like a plaintive
hand-organ tune. All the lovely things in the shop windows, the
furs and jewels, roses and orchids, seemed to belong to her as she
passed them. Not to have wrapped up and sent home, certainly; where
would she put them? But they were hers to live among.</p>

<p>At last it was five o'clock, the grey twilight was gone, and she
turned toward the Arts Building. She was frightened as she went up
in the elevator, and tried not to think at all. She lifted the
brass knocker, and Sebastian opened the door. Before she had time
to speak, just as she was, in her hat and coat, he took her in his
arms.</p>

<p>They stood for a long while without moving, in the dusky little
hall among overcoats and walking-sticks. Lucy felt him take
everything that was in her heart; there was nothing to hold back
any more. His soft, deep breathing seemed to drink her up entirely,
to take away all that was timid, uncertain, bewildered. Something
beautiful and serene came from his heart into hers; wisdom and
sadness. If he took her secret, he gave her his in return; that he
had renounced life. Nobody would ever share his life again. But he
had unclouded faith in the old and lovely dreams of man; that he
would teach her and share with her. When they went into the music
room, neither of them had spoken.</p>

<p>The tea things were set out before the fire. The kettle had
almost boiled dry, and Sebastian went to fill it, leaving Lucy
alone in a room which she seemed unable to enter. The piano and the
book-shelves were far away, out of reach; and she was far away from
herself. She felt as if everything were on the point of vanishing.
Now that he knew, he might think it his duty to let her go. He
could sweep her existence blank with one word.</p>

<p>He came back, came and stood before her, but she could not look
up until she heard her name.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Lucy. I am not going to make love to you.
Though it's true enough I love you." He sat down on the arm of her
chair. "Why do you crouch away from me like that? And your little
hands are so cold. What are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;of things being different. Maybe you won't
let me come and play for you any more. Please don't send me away. I
won't be a bother."</p>

<p>"Send you away? I'm afraid I'm not so unselfish. Perhaps I
ought. But it isn't as if you were really in love. I am quite old
enough to be your father, you know. You are merely growing
up,&mdash;and finding things. It was just that freshness which
charmed me, I thought. But now I believe I love everything about
you, Lucy. The mornings used to be dull and heavy here. You brought
something sweet into them. I began to watch for you from the
window, and when I caught sight of you tripping along in the wind,
my heart grew lighter. I love young ardour, young fire. I had a
nice boy in my house once; but he had to go away to school. What a
difference you have made in my life here! When you knocked, it was
like springtime coming in at the door. I went to work with more
spirit because things were new and wonderful to you."</p>

<p>Lucy pressed her face against his shoulder to hide the tears of
happiness. When she heard him tell her that she had given him
something!&mdash;and only a little while ago that had seemed the
most extravagant of all hopes, so foolish that she was ashamed of
it, even in the dark. Lying there she felt herself drifting again
into his breathing, into his heart-beats. She knew this could not
last; in a moment she must gather herself up and be herself again.
Yet she knew, too, that it would last a lifetime.</p>

<p>There was a light, familiar knock at the door. She drew away and
went over to the fireplace. Giuseppe always knocked like that
before he entered with his latch-key. He stuck his head in and
asked whether the Signore was ready to dress.</p>

<p>Sebastian told him to come in and lay his clothes out quickly.
"I have a dinner engagement, Lucy, and I shall take you home on the
way. Wait here for me a few moments. I shan't be long."</p>

<p>He disappeared with Giuseppe, and Lucy sat down in the chair she
had quitted. She sat without stirring, her hands lying open in her
lap, listening to the faint noises that came up from the
street.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes Sebastian came out in his dinner coat. "Can
you change as quickly as that, Lucy?" He was standing before the
fire, putting on his white gloves, when a latch-key scratched at
the door. It opened, and in walked James Mockford, also in a dinner
coat; a silk hat on the back of his head and a cane in his hand.
Seeing Lucy, he removed his hat and bowed.</p>

<p>"Come in, Jimmy! Where did you drop from?" Sebastian called
jovially. Mockford was already in, and Lucy thought he needed no
encouragement. There was something impertinent about the way he
entered the room.</p>

<p>"From my lodgings. I'm dining with friends, and I thought you
might give me a lift in your cab."</p>

<p>Sebastian laughed, as if he liked his coolness. "Sorry, but I'm
afraid you'll have to purchase a cab for yourself tonight. I'm
taking Miss Gayheart home. However, if you choose to wait here, I
suppose I might come back for you."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'll wait." Mockford put his overcoat and hat on the
piano and limped over to the table, where he began eating the
sandwiches that had been meant for tea. He looked into each of the
two unused cups and wrinkled his nose. Lucy watched him in
amazement. She wondered whether he did use white paint, or a liquid
powder, on his face at night. He glanced at Sebastian over his
plate of sandwiches.</p>

<p>"Wearing a ribbon, I see?"</p>

<p>"The dinner is given for the Belgian Minister."</p>

<p>This time Lucy thought Sebastian spoke rather frigidly. She
noticed a tiny purple knot in his lapel. Giuseppe brought his
overcoat.</p>

<p>Mockford finished the sandwiches and wiped his fingers.</p>

<p>"How long shall you be gone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can stop for you in twenty minutes or so."</p>

<p>"Will you send the hall porter up for me when you come? I don't
care to stand about down there on my bad leg. Good night, Miss
Gayheart." He half rose when she got up to go, but dropped back
immediately. As she went out, she saw him stretched in the deepest
chair, his lame foot on the couch, a cigarette hanging loosely
between his lips.</p>

<p>"Mustn't let Mockford get on your nerves," Sebastian told her,
as he got into the cab after her and shut the door. He patted
Lucy's arm soothingly when she tried to protest. "Oh, my dear, I
can read your face like a book! You haven't much skill in
dissimulation. Jimmy is rather brassy at times,&mdash;fault of his
early training. He came out of the slums, really. Mrs. Sebastian
found him for me. A friend of her father discovered this queer,
talented, tricky boy. He's all right at bottom, but he's not well.
That makes him peevish. Just now he's fighting with me; for his
rights, he says. Some of his cronies have put it into his head that
he ought to be printed on my programs as assisting artist instead
of accompanist. I won't have it, and he's sulky."</p>

<p>Lucy wanted to say a great deal, but she only brought out: "In
general, then, you think he's&mdash;loyal?"</p>

<p>Sebastian laughed. "Loyal? As loyal as anyone who plays second
fiddle ever is. We mustn't expect too much!"</p>

<h3>13</h3>

<p>Lucy used to be sorry that her birthday came in March. In
Chicago it was the most disagreeable season of the year; and at
home, in Haverford, it was always cheerless enough. The ice on the
Platte had either disappeared or gone rotten, so there was no
skating. The wind never stopped blowing, and the air was full of
dust from the ploughed fields and sand from the river banks. But
this year March was the happiest month she had ever known.</p>

<p>Sebastian was getting up his programs for his April concert tour
in the East, and every morning was important. It was much more as
if he were really living at the studio now. He kept the place full
of flowers and growing plants because he found Lucy liked them.
When he opened the door for her, he met her with a kiss. That
embrace, often playful but never hurried, seemed to bring them at
once into complete understanding: every sound, every silence, had
the beauty of intimacy and confidence. The air one breathed in that
room was different from any other in the world. Lucy thought there
was even a special kind of light there, which kept a soft tint of
gold, though the fog was brown and the smoke hung low outside. The
weather was consistently bad. The ice cakes ground upon each other
in the Lake, rain and wet snow beat down upon the city, high winds
strewed the streets with broken umbrellas. But when she reached the
Arts Building the elevator took her up into an untroubled
climate.</p>

<p>It was at night, when she was quiet and alone, that she got the
greatest happiness out of each day&mdash;after it had passed! Why
this was, she never knew. In the darkness she went over every
moment of the morning again. Nothing was lost; not a phrase of a
song, not a look on his face or a motion of his hand. In these
quiet hours she had time to reflect, and to realize that the few
weeks since the 4th of January were longer than the twenty-one
years that had gone before. Life, it seemed, could not be measured
by years.</p>

<p>It was not that she had been discontented before. She had been
happy ever since she first came to Chicago; thought herself
fortunate to have escaped from a little town to a city, and to work
with a kind and conscientious man like Paul Auerbach. But that time
was far away. She began a new life on the night when she first
heard Clement Sebastian. Until that night she had played with
trifles and make-believes.</p>

<p>Since then she had changed so much in her thoughts, in her ways,
even in her looks, that she might wonder she knew
herself&mdash;except that the changes were all in the direction of
becoming more and more herself. She was no longer afraid to like or
to dislike anything too much. It was as if she had found some
authority for taking what was hers and rejecting what seemed
unimportant.</p>

<p>One morning Sebastian brought out an old English song, She Never
Told Her Love. He sang it over several times, walking up and down
and smiling to himself: But let concealment, like a worm i' the
bud, feed on her damask cheek.</p>

<p>He stopped beside the piano and bent down, bringing his face
close to Lucy's.</p>

<p>"It doesn't feed on yours, my dear!"</p>

<p>She started and put her hand quickly to her cheek. "But why
should it? I have nothing to conceal!"</p>

<p>"Nothing? Nothing troubles you?"</p>

<p>"How can you ask me?" She looked up at him in astonishment.
"When I live my life out under your eyes every day?"</p>

<p>"Don't you sometimes feel it's a waste, living your life
out?"</p>

<p>"Not for me, it isn't. Have we finished?"</p>

<p>"Once again, please."</p>

<p>As Lucy got up from the piano, she drew a long breath. "I've
never heard that song before. The words are lovely, too."</p>

<p>Sebastian laughed. "Oh, yes? And there are plenty more where
those came from." He went to the bookcase, ran his finger along a
row of small red leather volumes, and pulled one out of its place.
"Take it along. You'll find the lines of this song, and others.
Lots of lovely words." He sometimes used that teasing tone, as if
she were a child.</p>

<p>Lucy blushed. She had read it, certainly, and had thought it a
rather foolish comedy, where everybody was pretending and nobody
was in earnest. Until she began to play for Sebastian she had never
known that words had any value aside from their direct meaning.</p>

<h3>14</h3>

<p>Soon after Sebastian left for his Eastern tour, Lucy got a
letter from Harry Gordon: he was coming on for a week of the opera,
and she must remember her promise. In those days the New York opera
company came to Chicago for several weeks every spring. Last year
she had been glad to go to the opera with Harry. But now everything
was different: she didn't want to see him, didn't want to be
reminded of Haverford or of anything that lay behind her. She was
going to the Public Library every day now, to hunt through the
newspapers for notices of Sebastian's concerts; that took time. Her
life was exactly as she wanted it, and Harry would spoil it. He
would manage to prove to her that she had been living in a dream,
that she was Lucy Gayheart and had been fooling herself all this
while.</p>

<p>In his letter Harry asked where he could meet her. She knew he
hated calling for her at the bakery. Sebastian didn't mind waiting
in the restaurant downstairs when he came to take her out to
dinner, but it annoyed Harry. She sent a note to the hotel where he
would be stopping, telling him to meet her at Auerbach's studio on
Monday, after her lessons. Auerbach's show studio was used as a
reception room, when he was not giving a lesson there. His private
office opened behind it. Across the hall was a much bleaker room,
with a north light, where Lucy heard the younger pupils, and
practised if she had a vacant hour.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon when Lucy came out from this back studio she
found Auerbach himself in the reception room, entertaining Harry
Gordon, and they seemed to be getting on very well together. As she
crossed the room toward him, she suddenly felt pleased with Harry.
He came to meet her with such a jolly smile, fresh and ruddy and
well turned-out in his new grey clothes. In a flash she was
conscious of the thing she had always liked best in him, the fine
physical balance which made him a good dancer and a tireless
skater. Paul Auerbach seemed as pleased at their meeting as Lucy
was herself. He was plainly reluctant to have Harry's call cut
short, urged him to come in again, suggested that Lucy bring him
out to his house to see Mrs. Auerbach.</p>

<p>As he walked to the door with them, he asked Harry when he had
arrived. Harry replied that he had come in "by the morning train,"
without betraying the fact that he had already been in Chicago
three days. He had written his tailor to have two suits ready for
the last fitting, and he made no calls until these were sent to his
hotel. He wanted to wear exactly what well-dressed men in Chicago
were wearing.</p>

<p>After they left the studio, Harry said they must go somewhere
for dinner. "Shall we go early, or do you want to dress and have me
call for you later?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! We can dine in state tomorrow evening, before the
opera. I'd rather you took me to some quiet place where we can
talk."</p>

<p>"Anything you like. We mean to have one good time this week,
don't we, Lucy?"</p>

<p>Lucy remembered that when Harry was out for a good time he swept
one along with him, just as he did in a polka or a schottish. She
liked to do those rather violent, jumpy dances with him; he had a
good sense of rhythm and put so much lift and spring behind his
partner.</p>

<p>When she got home that evening, Lucy told herself that it was
nice to see Harry again. She hated the idea of throwing over old
friends. She was thinking, as she undressed, that Harry would be
very intelligent if he were not so conceited; it was a kind of
mental near-sightedness, and kept him from seeing what didn't
immediately concern him. But tonight she hadn't minded that he was
pleased with himself, because he was pleased with everything. He
hadn't made the countryman's mistake of finding fault with the
service and the food. He had tipped the waiters generously, without
fumbling or ostentation. He had insisted upon a drive along
Michigan Avenue before they came home&mdash;a hopeful sign! With
the Gordons, who had good horses and carriages of their own, a
hired carriage was regarded as a painful extravagance and meant the
shortest route. She thought she must have forgotten how much she
liked to hear Harry talk&mdash;for his voice, chiefly. No matter
what he was saying, you could guess his real feeling from his
voice, once you knew its several disguises. There was the genial,
confidential tone, just tinged by regret, with which he refused a
loan to a man who needed it. And there was the other friendliness,
not so very different (a little less concerned, indeed), but that
was real.</p>

<p>The next evening, for Aida, Harry appeared in his new dress
clothes, very handsome and correct. Lucy had been teaching all
afternoon and was rather tired when they drove to his hotel for
dinner, but his good spirits revived her. At the opera they had
excellent seats; Harry had written for them weeks ago. He was in
his most engaging mood, and didn't once try to ridicule things
which she "held sentimentally sacred," as he said. He enjoyed the
music, and the audience, and being with Lucy. His enthusiasm for
the tenor was sincere; the duet in the third act was, he whispered,
his idea of music. He beat time softly to the triumphal march, and
didn't mind that the trumpets played off pitch.</p>

<p>When he said good-night to Lucy at the foot of her staircase,
she could honestly tell him that she loved going to the opera with
him.</p>

<h3>15</h3>

<p>On the morning after they heard Otello, Lucy cut out her
practising because Harry had asked her to take him through the Art
Museum. It was a rather gentle, sunny morning, and as they walked
over toward Michigan Avenue they stopped to do a little shopping.
Lucy caught at every pretext for delay. Last year when they went
through the Museum together they had disagreed violently about
almost everything, and had come away in a bad humour. Marshall
Field's was a much better place for Harry, and it was fun choosing
handkerchiefs and neckties for him. But he kept looking at his
watch, and got her to the galleries soon after they were open. He
was careful not to make any comments that would irritate her; she
could actually feel caution in his step and voice. What a fury she
must have been last spring! Not once did she catch that smart
squint in his eyes. He did, occasionally, square his shoulders
before a picture and twist his mouth awry, as if he would like to
call the painter's bluff; but he did not try to be funny. When they
reached a loan exhibit of French Impressionists he broke down, and
began pointing out figures that were not correctly drawn.</p>

<p>"Now, you'll admit, Lucy&mdash;" he would begin
persuasively.</p>

<p>"Certainly I admit, but I don't think it matters. I don't know
anything about pictures, but I think some are meant to represent
objects, and others are meant to express a kind of feeling merely,
and then accuracy doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"But anatomy is a fact," he insisted, "and facts are at the
bottom of everything."</p>

<p>She did not answer him impatiently, as she would have done once,
but bent her head a little and spoke in a quiet voice which
disconcerted him. "Are they, Harry? I'm not so sure."</p>

<p>He didn't reply to this. Something in her tone had made him feel
very tenderly toward her. She must be tired, he thought. He saw a
door open, leading to one of the stone porticos at the back of the
building, that looked on the Lake. He touched Lucy's elbow.</p>

<p>"Let's go out on that balcony and get some fresh air."</p>

<p>The morning had grown warmer, but a mist had come up which hid
the sky-line. The water was faintly blue, and above it everything
was soft; a silvery mist with changing blue and green at the heart
of it, far out. Even the grey gulls flew by on languid wings. The
air felt full of spring showers. On a morning like this...Lucy felt
an ache come up in her throat. When she looked off at that soft
promise of spring, spring already happening in the colours of the
sky before it had come on earth, such a longing awoke in her that
it seemed as if it would break her heart. That happiness she had so
lately found, where was it? Everything threatened it, the way of
the world was against it. It had escaped her. She had lost it as
one can lose a ravishing melody, remembering the mood of it, the
kind of joy it gave, but unable to recall precisely the air itself.
And she couldn't breathe in this other kind of life. It stifled
her, woke in her a frantic fear&mdash;the fear of falling back into
it forever. If only one could lose one's life and one's body and be
nothing but one's desire; if the rest could melt away, and that
could float with the gulls, out yonder where the blue and green
were changing!</p>

<p>A far-away voice was saying something about lunch. She came back
with a start.</p>

<p>"No, Harry, please. I have a headache, and I want to get home as
quickly as I can. If I am to go with you tonight, I must lie down
and try to get over this."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>All that afternoon Lucy stayed quietly in her room. She told
herself that she would see Harry Gordon's vacation through and do
her best for him. There shouldn't be one flash of temper to regret
afterwards. It wasn't his fault that she had changed so much. She
was sorry now that she had ever let him come at all, but she must
make the best of it. She had enjoyed going to four operas, one
right after another. She hadn't heard a great many in her life; she
was too busy and too poor. They had listened like two young people
who had good seats and who were there to be pleased with
everything. Tonight they would hear Traviata, and for tomorrow,
Saturday, they had chosen the matinee instead of the evening
performance, because Lucy had never heard Lohengrin, and she
especially wanted to.</p>

<h3>16</h3>

<p>Saturday was a windy, bright April day. There were boys on the
streets selling violets and daffodils, and all the barrel-organs
were out playing O Sole Mio! Lucy was in high spirits and felt sure
of a happy ending&mdash;Harry was leaving tomorrow.</p>

<p>It chanced that Lucy had never heard even the prelude to
Lohengrin played by an orchestra; the first measures caught her
unaware. Before the first act was half over she was longing to be
alone; this wasn't the kind of opera to be hearing with Harry. She
found herself leaning away from him as far as possible. The music
kept bringing back things she used to feel in Sebastian's studio;
belief in an invisible, inviolable world. When the act closed and
the lights were turned on, her eyes were still shining with tears.
If Harry had begun to tease, it wouldn't have mattered then. But he
didn't. He glanced sidewise at her and then read his program.
Presently he ventured a remark.</p>

<p>"That tenor's fine, now isn't he? He's a good actor, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, he believes in it." She spoke quietly. She was beginning
to feel hostile toward him, though he was behaving so well. Harry
understood that she was deeply moved. He would have thought that
sort of thing ridiculous in a man, but in a girl it was rather
attractive.</p>

<p>When the curtain fell on the second act Lucy turned in her seat
and looked restlessly about her. In the same row, far to the left,
a man was leaning forward, looking at her; a red face, a very white
shirt-front, an excited, perspiring smile. She caught her breath
and cried aloud: "Giuseppe!" though he was not near enough to hear
her. She leaned forward and waved her hand. He bowed again and
again, in a way that was not familiar, not servile, but wholly
devoted and respectful.</p>

<p>The sight of him had brought a rush of delight over her whole
body. She shivered and her hands grew cold. That he should have
been there all the while, he who was such a part of her other life!
She sat through the rest of the opera feeling that nothing had
really vanished, everything would come back. When the singers came
out to take their curtain calls, she looked not at them but at
Giuseppe, who stood applauding with his hands far out in front of
him. The ends of his black-and-white silk muffler hung almost to
his knees. As the steel curtain descended, he snatched his hat and
overcoat and ran off through the crowd. Lucy slipped her arms into
the cloak Harry had been patiently holding.</p>

<p>"Who's your enthusiastic friend?" he asked good-naturedly as he
steered her toward the back of the house.</p>

<p>"He's an Italian who works about the studio where I go to play
accompaniments."</p>

<p>"Music student, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! He's just a&mdash;workman. But he's very musical."</p>

<p>Harry laughed. "He looks it!"</p>

<p>As they made their way slowly through the crowded foyer, Harry
kept trying to hum Lohengrin's farewell to the swan. Lucy began
talking rapidly to divert his attention. But Harry had liked that
song, and he kept trying! When they stepped outside into the
treacherous mildness of the April afternoon, he hailed a cab.</p>

<p>"How about a little drive to get some air? It's too early for
dinner. Take us out through the parks, driver, for an hour or so.
There's no place anybody can make a call on you, except in a cab,
Lucy." He sat down beside her, stretched his long legs, and began
to laugh softly. "You know there was something cute about that
little dago. I like to see people have a good time. But how the
mischief can he afford a seat like that?" He spoke with concern,
seemed worried about it.</p>

<p>"Oh, when they admire anything very much, they don't count the
cost!" She tried to say this carelessly.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "All the same, the day of counting costs
comes along in the end, Lucy mio"</p>

<p>Lucy bit her lip. Wasn't that Harry Gordon in two words! He had
been hearing Italian operas all week, and felt acclimated. Lucy
mio! And a moment ago he thought he was humming the tenor's aria.
She looked out of the window and tried to fix her attention on the
misty blue spring sky and the dove-coloured water. Distant
lighthouses were faintly shining.</p>

<p>Harry didn't mind her silence. He was thinking he would bring
Lucy on for the opera every year. But they might just as well go
through to New York; then they could go in mid-winter, when
business was dull at home. He was full of his own plans, and the
future looked bright to him. There was a part of himself that Harry
was ashamed to live out in the open (he hated a sentimental man),
but he could live it through Lucy. She would be his excuse for
doing a great many pleasant things he wouldn't do on his own
account. He pressed her arm as he lounged back in the cab, and
began humming the swan song again.</p>

<p>Lucy stirred. "No, it goes like this, Harry."</p>

<p>He ducked his head and laughed. "Right you are! Now suppose we
turn and drive back for dinner."</p>

<p>The dining-room at the Auditorium hotel was filling up when they
entered. A great many people were dining there before the evening
performance. Harry found a table to his taste and ordered champagne
to be brought with the soup, remarking that it was never too early
for a good thing. "When I have a place of my own, I shall keep
plenty of it on hand&mdash;for special occasions."</p>

<p>He talked a good deal through dinner, said he hated going home
tomorrow, but he had to relieve his father in the bank. His father
wanted to get down to Hot Springs for his rheumatism. He thanked
Lucy for having given him so much of her time. "Music doesn't mean
much to me without you, except to remind me of you."</p>

<p>She threw him a smile. She had less colour than usual. She was
dreadfully tired. Thank God tonight was the end of it! She had gone
her limit, and now she wanted to be left alone with her own
life.</p>

<p>The dinner seemed to be dragging on, even the dessert didn't end
it. Harry ordered liqueurs and lit a cigar. He leaned across the
table and took up Lucy's gloves, which were lying by her plate.</p>

<p>"And now, Lucy&mdash;" Something affectionate and masterful in
his voice made her dread what was coming. "And now isn't it about
time we got down to business? We know each other pretty well.
You've had your little fling. You want to see the world, but you'll
see it a lot better with me. Why waste any more time? This is
April; I should think we might be married in May. Oh, June if you
like! But we mustn't let another summer slip by."</p>

<p>Lucy frowned and avoided his eyes. "Nonsense, Harry. I'm not
ready to marry anyone. I won't be, for a long while."</p>

<p>He put his open palm down heavily on the table. "But I am! Just
ready. And we've always known we would do it some day, both of
us."</p>

<p>She gave a dry laugh. "Have we? Why, you haven't been sure of
yourself half the time!"</p>

<p>Harry chuckled guiltily. "Most of the time I've been sure." Then
he looked at her with a singular straightforwardness, looked quite
through the professional geniality which usually gleamed over his
eyes like a pair of spectacles. "All the time I've been sure at
bottom. I have never been able to believe in any sort of happy life
except with you. That's the truth."</p>

<p>Lucy felt it was the truth. She could find nothing to say.</p>

<p>"Everything will be just as you wish it. You shall have the kind
of house you like, and the kind of friends. I want the life you'd
naturally make for yourself,&mdash;and it's the only life I do
want."</p>

<p>She was trapped. He was looking straight and talking straight.
When he was like this she was afraid of him. It seemed unfair to
sit there and let him take off all his jocular masks and show her a
naked man who had perhaps never been exposed to any eye before. She
must stop him before he went any further. She thrust out her hands
across the table.</p>

<p>"Don't, Harry, please! It's no use. Everything has changed this
winter. My life is tied up with somebody else. It's done. I have no
choice. I love another man."</p>

<p>Gordon seemed not to understand her at first.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what's all this? Another man? And he lets you play
about with me all week? You're trying to fool me, Lucy!" He looked
at her with a threat in his eyes.</p>

<p>She had fallen into this; she must get out of it, get it over.
"No, I'm not. He's away. It's the man I work for, play
accompaniments for. I'm not the same person I used to be. I didn't
mean to tell anyone, but I can't let you go on making plans."</p>

<p>While she was speaking, the harshness on Gordon's face slowly
melted. A twinkle came in his eyes, as if he had found the catch in
the puzzle. He so far forgot himself that he put his hand down over
Lucy's and held it firmly when she tried to draw it away.</p>

<p>"Now, Lucy! Every girl falls in love with her singing teacher,
but I thought you, for one, had escaped!"</p>

<p>She felt her cheeks burn with anger. "He's not my singing
teacher! He's a great artist," she muttered, angrier still because
this sounded so childish.</p>

<p>"Very well, I've no objection; the greater the better! But
you'll soon recover, my dear." He refused to be annoyed. He was
glowing with tolerance. She gave him a defiant look and managed to
get her hand away. He considered a moment, then leaned forward and
spoke softly, in a confident, teasing tone. "Now see here, Lucy,
how far has this nonsense gone?"</p>

<p>The dining-room swam and tilted before Lucy's eyes. "How far?"
she broke out in a flash of scorn. "How far? All the way; all the
way! There's no going back. Can't you understand <i>anything?</i>"
She did not see his face, her eyes were blind as if she were
looking into a furnace. But she knew that he got up and left the
table.</p>

<p>When she had recovered herself a little, she saw him at the
other end of the room, talking to the head waiter. He put something
in the waiter's hand and walked out of the dining-room.</p>

<p>Lucy drank some ice-water slowly. She was ashamed that she had
lied. She had tried to tell him the truth about a feeling; but a
feeling meant nothing to him, he had to be clubbed by a situation.
She supposed it was just his coarse good-nature, his readiness to
accept as a negligible truancy anything not actually compromising,
that had driven her beyond herself. It was as if he had brought all
his physical force, his big well-kept body, to ridicule something
that had no body, that was a faith, an ardour.&mdash;Why had she
ever tried to be nice to him, when she knew all the while he was
like that? Well, it was over now, and she hoped she had cut through
his stupidity and conceit. It seemed that she had, since he did not
come back.</p>

<p>After about a quarter of an hour the head waiter came to her
table and, bending down, spoke to her in a way which made an
awkward situation seem quite usual and in order.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon said, miss, that if he were not back from the
telephone in ten minutes, you should not wait for him. He said you
would understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you." Lucy caught up her gloves, and her bag, in
which there was no money at all. "The check?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"The check is paid, miss. Shall I call a cab for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please."</p>

<p>He gave an order to one of the service boys, and held her cloak
for her. "You will find it very warm outside, miss, like a summer
evening. We have had good weather for the opera season; and last
year it was so bad!" He spoke without an accent, but his voice and
intonation were unmistakably Italian. He took Lucy through the long
dining-room with an air of authority, as if he were conducting some
important personage, and at the door motioned one of his
subordinates to put her into her carriage. She had not even a
quarter to give the boy who brought the cab. Harry Gordon had
walked off like that, leaving her to get home as best she could.
What a coward, what a boor! She had some money at home, in her
bureau drawer; but suppose she didn't have? She might walk home for
all he cared.</p>

<p>When the cab stopped before the bakery, she asked the cabman
whether he could come upstairs for his fare. "I'm too tired to
bring it down, driver."</p>

<p>"Sure, miss. I got a weight. Just sit still while I fasten my
hitch-strap." He helped her up the two flights and thanked her for
his tip.</p>

<h3>17</h3>

<p>The next morning Lucy awoke sick and sore. She wanted not to be
alone for a moment, and hurried over to Auerbach's
studio&mdash;perhaps he would have time to give her a lesson.</p>

<p>He met her with a newspaper in his hand. "Look at this, Lucy;
Clement is advertised to give a second recital in New York on the
3rd of May. He will scarcely get here before he goes back again.
Remarkable success he has had."</p>

<p>That was the important thing. She felt better at once; nothing
else mattered, when all was going well with Sebastian. Auerbach
himself seemed more wide awake than usual; and for the next few
days he gave Lucy the kind of attention and criticism he was
usually too easy-going to give anyone. Under his heavy domesticity
and middle-aged content there was a discriminating musical
intelligence&mdash;not often brought to the front. As for Lucy, she
was working to forget something. But at odd moments that sickening
last scene with Harry Gordon would come back upon her and make her
angry and ashamed. She hadn't lied often in her life, she was too
proud. And that was such a cheap, crawling, shabby lie! It was like
boasting she had a claim on Sebastian, when she had none. She had
used his name in a way that she could never tell him, and her ears
burned whenever she thought of it. How could she have said such a
thing? She considered writing to Harry, but that was difficult. She
composed letters to him when she should have been asleep, and the
next day put off writing them.</p>

<p>One evening when she went downstairs to get her dinner, she
found Giuseppe walking up and down outside, in front of the open
stairway. He was wearing a black coat and looked small and grave
and important. Off went his hat, and as he stood bareheaded, he
broke into such a rush of speech that she could not understand him
at all; she caught only that Signor Weisbourn had come to the
studio about something urgent. She held up her hand and begged him
to speak slowly.</p>

<p>"Scusi, signorina." He put on his hat and began again. Sebastian
had written Mr. Weisbourn that all his plans were changed. He had
accepted some engagements in England and would sail on the 4th of
May, the day after his second New York recital.</p>

<p>Here Lucy interrupted. "But this is the last week of April,
Giuseppe. Isn't he coming back here at all?"</p>

<p>"Si, signorina, for three days." Sebastian would arrive
tomorrow, Friday, and would leave Chicago on Monday night. Giuseppe
was to sail with him and would be with him until the engagements in
England were over. Then he was going to Italy to see his father. He
had been packing all day, to close the studio for the summer. Mr.
Weisbourn had not asked him to communicate with Lucy; he had come
on his own responsibility, thinking she might have arrangements to
make or plans to change.</p>

<p>"No, there is nothing to arrange, Giuseppe. I have no plans. I
wish I were going with you."</p>

<p>"And I, signorina, just as we were! It will be like that again
when we come back in October. A summer is soon gone."</p>

<p>Lucy could not let Giuseppe go away; not until she had grown a
little used to the news he brought, until she had time to take it
in. She walked him round and round the block, asking him trivial
questions about his preparations, his packing&mdash;was the piano
gone? No, he had received no orders about the piano.</p>

<p>It was the crowded hour in the crowded part of the city,
everyone going home from work. She and Giuseppe could scarcely hear
each other speak for the clatter of truck wheels on the dirty
pavements. Troops of screaming children on roller skates came
streaking down the sidewalk, but Lucy hardly noticed them. She
tried to keep close to Giuseppe, and everything around them was
blank. An enormous emptiness had opened on all sides of her. This
well-disposed little man seemed to be the only person who had
thought of her at all. Even he, in his mind, was already outward
bound. He began to tell her about the boat, Wilhelm der Grosse, on
which they were to sail; its length, its tonnage, how many
passengers it carried. He would be with the maestro in England and
then they would go to France: before he started for Florence he
would see the maestro's house at Chantilly, and his dogs, and the
Signora Sebastian, who was the daughter of a mi-lord, did Lucy
know?</p>

<p>As they came round the corner of the block after many circlings,
Lucy felt too tired to hear any more, and was glad to say
good-night. She forgot to thank him for coming. She did not go in
for dinner, but went languidly upstairs to her room.</p>

<p>So there would be no return; only another departure. Just now
she wished she had never met Sebastian at all. It would have been
better only to have heard him, to have seen him at a distance, and
to carry away a memory unclouded by personal disappointments. There
was nothing sure or safe in this life she was leading. She had been
sailing along in the air, like a little boy's kite; the wind drops,
and the kite comes down in the dirty street, among the drays and
roller skates.</p>

<p>There had been that one month, to be sure, when she lived under
a golden canopy among spring flowers, while the March winds and
rain threatened outside the windows. Then she was never afraid of
cruel surprises. Perhaps that was all she was to have in this
world; some people got very little. It was strange, to feel
everything slipping away from one and to have no power to struggle,
no right to complain. One had to sit with folded hands and see it
all go. You couldn't, after all, live above your level: with good
luck you might, for a few breaths, hold yourself up in that more
vital air, but you dropped back; down, down into flatness, and it
was worse than if you had never been out of it. She had known that
he was to sail in June&mdash;but that had seemed years away. She
had never thought about it for more than a moment. She hadn't taken
it in that after he went the days and hours would no longer carry
her anywhere.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>On Saturday morning Lucy was sitting in Sebastian's studio. Both
Sebastian and Auerbach were there; they had been in consultation
for some time before Lucy was sent for. They were talking to her,
about her, around her. Sometimes she listened and sometimes she did
not. Finding Auerbach there had made her indifferent to
everything.</p>

<p>She had known one of these men so long and the other so
intimately&mdash;and now she seemed a stranger to both. She felt as
if she were applying for a position of some sort, and not very
likely to get it. Moreover, she didn't want it, whatever it was.
She had not the faintest stirring of any wish or desire; and she
did not believe in anything they were saying.</p>

<p>The first shock came when she was told that Sebastian would not
be in Chicago next winter, but in New York. Lucy, they said, was to
go on in November, and work with him there as she had done here. He
and Auerbach had decided that she must stay in Chicago this summer,
to study in preparation for next season. Auerbach himself was not
going away; he was economizing in order to take his family abroad
next year. This studio was leased until October, the rent paid.
Sebastian suggested that she move into it as soon as he left it; it
would be much cooler than the place where she was living.</p>

<p>Lucy had been listening to them without comment, but now she
spoke.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't leave my own room, Mr. Sebastian. I'm used to
it, and I feel at home there."</p>

<p>"But you would get the Lake breezes here. Chicago is very hot,
you know. And you would soon feel at home&mdash;if you don't
already!"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, I couldn't do that. I wouldn't feel
like myself, moving in here."</p>

<p>Auerbach began to reason with her, but Sebastian cut him short.
"No, Paul, we mustn't press it. You'll surely be willing to use
this place as a studio, Lucy? You won't leave a good piano standing
here idle?"</p>

<p>Yes, she would be glad to work at his piano. "But I must have a
little time to think about these things."</p>

<p>"We haven't a great deal of time, Lucy. I don't like to go away
leaving you up in the air. This isn't the summer for you to go into
the country and vegetate. We want you to prepare seriously for next
season. Paul understands what I think you need most, and he has
promised to give you a great deal of attention."</p>

<p>At this point Auerbach rose to go. He stood holding his hat for
a moment, smiling down at the girl's discouraged face.</p>

<p>"I think you'll let Clement persuade you, Lucy. A winter in New
York would be a fine thing for you. Then maybe in the spring you
can go over to Vienna with my family. My wife has often said how
she wished you could go with us." The two men went out to the
elevator. They were still talking about her, Lucy knew. She wished
they would both go away and leave her here to cry. Everything they
wanted her to do seemed out of her reach.</p>

<p>Sebastian came back and stood over her where she sat limp in a
corner of the sofa.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a morning! First, Paul is so slow to see things; and
then Lucy so unwilling to see things. Why aren't you just a little
pleased? Don't you want to play for me any more? Or are you so fond
of Chicago you can't leave it?"</p>

<p>"Next winter is a long time away." Lucy looked up and smiled.
She was feeling more pleased already. "And May was very near. I
guess I'm disappointed to lose it."</p>

<p>"Oh, May would have been dragging out preparations that can be
made in two days! Your summer was really the first thing to
arrange. Next season is going to be an important one for me. For
you, too, I hope. A winter in New York, at your age&mdash;you don't
know what is waiting for you! And you'll like working with my new
accompanist.</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Mockford&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Is not coming back." Sebastian went over to his writing-desk
and began hunting for something, speaking to her over his shoulder.
"He doesn't know it yet. We shall arrange all that in England. I
intend to see that he's well placed, but he has been with me too
long. He and Weisbourn have been putting up some pretty little
tricks on me. So I am going to have a new agent and a new
accompanist. The best thing about this concert tour has been a
revival of interest, in here, I mean," he tapped his chest. "I've
met so many old friends who are still interested. Those things are
contagious." He put a letter in his pocket and came back to the
sofa. "Ah, now you are looking like Lucy again! You are beginning
to believe in all these nice things I've thought out for you?"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't thinking about them. I was thinking about you. It
seems to me that something good has happened to you."</p>

<p>"Dear child!" For the first time after this long absence he
gathered her up in his arms. "Now something good has happened to
me! And something good has come back to me."</p>

<h3>18</h3>

<p>On the last evening Lucy got to the Arts Building just as James
Mockford was arriving in a cab, followed by an express cart.
Besides his travelling luggage, he brought with him a rusty little
tin trunk and a large lounge chair, which he asked Sebastian to
store, as he was giving up his lodgings. Mockford's entrance caused
some confusion. Giuseppe dragged the trunk back into the bedroom,
beckoning Lucy to follow him. He whispered to her that later he
would get the ugly chair out of the way, so that she would not have
to look at it. He meant to leave the music room very nice for her,
not like a second-hand shop. She had noticed before that Giuseppe
disliked Mockford. He once said to her, when Sebastian's favourite
cigarette-case was not to be found, that, since he was responsible
for the place, no one but he should have a latch-key, <i>no
one</i>!&mdash;with a murderous flash in his quick eyes.</p>

<p>After Morris Weisbourn had arrived, and they were all gathered
in the music room, Mockford was the only person altogether
cheerful. He was so pleased to be leaving Chicago that he made
himself agreeable even to Lucy. Sebastian was at the bookcase
behind the piano, going over a pile of music. Giuseppe, who had
been so delighted to be starting for home, and to be sailing on a
big boat, had lost his enthusiasm. He stood in the background among
the trunks, his hands crossed before him, solemn and hushed, as if
he were waiting for a coffin to be carried out. They were all, of
course, impatiently expecting the transfer men who were to come and
get the luggage. The air in the room was heavy and hot&mdash;no
breeze, though all the windows were open. Out over the Lake the sky
was black, and from time to time there was a low growl of
thunder.</p>

<p>Sebastian called Lucy to his corner and began giving her some
directions, to which she tried to listen. But she was distracted by
Weisbourn and Mockford, who were talking very loud, as if they
wished everything they said to be heard. They had seated themselves
by an open window and were finishing the last bottle of port.
Weisbourn must have been drinking before he came; his dark blue
cheeks looked very thick, and his eyes were small. The moment they
sat down together they had been overtaken by the brotherly
affection which beams from two schemers who have done each other a
good turn.</p>

<p>"And when you are to be operate, you will send me a cable?
So?"</p>

<p>Sebastian shot a glance of amusement at the two from behind the
piano. Lucy saw their wineglasses touch, one in the round fat hand,
the other in the white freckled one.</p>

<p>Just then came heavy sounds and knocking at the door. Giuseppe
flew to admit the baggage men. "Thank God!" Sebastian murmured. As
soon as the trunks had gone down, he put on his topcoat and turned
to Mockford and Weisbourn.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I have some calls to make, and I am going to take
Miss Gayheart home. I shan't be back here. I will meet you at the
station. Giuseppe will take the hand luggage down at eleven. Leave
the keys with the doorman.</p>

<p>The cab Sebastian customarily used had been waiting outside half
an hour. He told the driver to open the windows and take them out
to the Park.</p>

<p>"You are worn out with all the fuss, and so am I," he said as
they drove up the avenue. He drew her head over on his shoulder.
"There. Shut your eyes and rest. We have three hours, all our own."
He felt her soft young body take the line of his as she lay against
him. She breathed lightly, like a child sleeping. He, too, closed
his eyes. The warm night air blew in over their faces. After a
while it began to smell of trees and new-cut grass, and the
confused city noises died away.</p>

<p>Sebastian felt a wet splash on his face. He put his hand out of
the window; it was raining a little. Then it came down harder, a
fierce spring shower.</p>

<p>"Asleep, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"We were glad to get away, weren't we? But I've grown fond of
that studio. I like to think it's not going to be shut up dumb and
dusty all summer, that you'll be coming and going. I shall be
thinking of you. When I am at sea, I shall look at my watch every
morning and figure the difference in time and tell myself whether
you have opened the piano yet."</p>

<p>Lucy buried her face closer, her hand on his shoulder tightened.
She felt the tears rising and could not hold them back.</p>

<p>"I ought to do better than this. I'm so sorry!" she
quavered.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear. Cry if you feel like it. Perhaps I shall cry
with you."</p>

<p>"It's only because I'm so afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid again? Of what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that you'll never come back! Something tells me you
won't."</p>

<p>"That's because you are just beginning, and are not used to
good-byes. They hurt, sometimes, even after one has gone through a
great many." Sebastian felt a heaviness of heart; he scarcely knew
whether on her account or his own. He was wondering whether there
was not some way of escape from his life: from concerts and hotels,
from Mockford, and his wife, and his place in France, from his
friends in England, from everything he was and had. In what
stretched out before him there was nothing he wanted very much. And
this youth and devotion would not be the same when he came back, he
knew; what he held against his heart was for tonight only. It was a
parting between two who would never meet again.</p>

<p>Lucy knew what he was thinking. She felt a kind of hopeless
despair in the embrace that tightened about her. As they passed a
lamppost she looked up, and in the flash of light she saw his face.
Oh, then it came back to her! The night he sang When We Two Parted
and she knew he had done something to her life. Presentiments like
that one were not meaningless; they came out of the future.
<i>Surely that hour foretold sorrow to this</i>. They were going to
lose something. They were both clinging to it and to each other,
but they must lose it.</p>

<p>Presently Sebastian stopped the carriage and told the driver he
could wait for them. He took Lucy's arm and they walked for a long
while up and down the winding gravel paths, the bitter fragrance of
young lilac leaves coming sharp into their faces at every turn. The
rain had stopped, but the dripping bushes showered them with
waterdrops. Their hands and faces were wet; it was good to feel.
There was not a star to be seen, but the blackness above them was
soft and velvety between the scattered park lights. Sebastian was
telling Lucy that perhaps next summer they would be walking under
night skies far away from here. If she went abroad with the
Auerbachs, he would join them in Vienna. There were a great many
things he would like to show her for the first time;
gardens&mdash;forests&mdash;mountains.</p>

<p>They had turned back toward the carriage, the wet gravel
crushing softly under their feet. As he came under one of the
lamp-posts, he slipped out his watch. He said nothing to Lucy, but
he gave the cabman her street-number. They drove back into the
heart of the city in silence, as they had come away from it.</p>

<p>At the bakery entrance Sebastian got out and followed Lucy up
the two flights of stairs to her own door. In the dim hall light he
took her face in his hands and looked into it for a long moment,
Lucy felt the old terror coming back; <i>to sever for
years</i>...She couldn't bear it any longer.</p>

<p>"Go," she whispered, "go now!" She scarcely felt his arms, his
lips; she could only think that in a moment he would not be there
at all. He held her closer and closer, and then he let her go. She
stood just inside her door, leaning against it, listening to his
quick heavy tread down the first stairway&mdash;the
second&mdash;then she heard the cab door slam.</p>

<p>Sebastian knew she was listening. He shut the door violently to
end her suspense. A last signal. He sank back in the seat and
closed his eyes as the cab lumbered off. Against the rumble of the
wheels he spoke aloud to himself. What he said was:</p>

<p>"Ein schoner Stern ging auf in meiner Nacht."</p>

<h3>19</h3>

<p>One hot morning in the middle of May, Lucy was putting fresh
lavender bags in her bureau drawers. Lifting a pile of muslin
underclothes, she came upon an unopened letter&mdash;a letter from
Haverford, from Pauline! She laughed, but she was ashamed, really!
It had come a week ago, when she was just beginning to practise in
Sebastian's studio, trying to feel at her ease there, and she was
afraid of anything that might dishearten her. Pauline's letters
often had that effect, so she tucked this one out of sight for the
moment,&mdash;and then forgot all about it. She thought, as she
took it up and looked at it, that perhaps she hadn't made a mistake
in forgetting! The letter was thick and bulky (a bad sign), and the
handwriting on the envelope looked, even more than usual, like eggs
rolling downhill. Pauline had inherited so many German
characteristics&mdash;what a pity she couldn't have inherited a
German script!</p>

<p>As Lucy opened the letter some newspaper clippings fell out.
Pauline announced the theme at once. Harry Gordon was married!
Married to Miss Arkwright of St. Joe, and they had started for
Alaska on their wedding trip. Everyone in Haverford was "talking."
People thought he had treated Lucy very badly. It was a great shock
to her old friends. They had always believed his "intentions" were
serious. They were asking Pauline what had happened, and she didn't
know what to say. What did Lucy wish her to say, "under the
circumstances"?</p>

<p>Lucy tore the letter to bits and threw it into the waste-basket.
So Harry thought he would show her, did he? Such haste must have
inconvenienced Miss Arkwright a trifle; but that wouldn't bother
Harry, if he had his revenge. He must have given her about a week's
notice! The announcement in the St. Joseph Gazette said they were
to live in Haverford! That would certainly be dull for the bride.
She crumpled the clipping and threw it after the letter.</p>

<p>"It would be a joke," she said to herself, "if Harry has gone
and married Miss Arkwright more on my account than her own."</p>

<p>She laughed, but all the same that announcement left a bitter
taste in her mouth. As she got ready to walk over to the studio,
she was thinking that she had lost an old friend; and she had told
him the kind of falsehood that made her think poorly of
herself.</p>

<p>When she reached the Arts Building the hall porter's smile, hand
to cap, changed the colour of her thoughts. George, the elevator
man, held his car back to tell her there was a storm on its way
from Duluth. The attendants about the place were devoted to
Sebastian, and they admired Lucy. That was pleasant. They liked to
see her come and go; so many of the studios were empty now.</p>

<p>Lucy hung her hat and jacket exactly where she used to put her
winter things. Giuseppe had left one of Sebastian's rain-coats
hanging in the entry hall, and a collection of walking-sticks in
the rack. She went into the music room, opened the windows, and
stood breathing in the fresh air and looking out at the glittering
blue water.</p>

<p>She had not begun to come here at once after Sebastian went
away,&mdash;not, indeed, until she had a note from him, written on
the boat and sent back by the tug. He began:</p>

<blockquote>"It is eleven o'clock here. That means that you have
just got to the studio and are opening the piano. I shall listen to
hear that you do not begin lazily. I still feel more there than
here."</blockquote>

<p>An hour after that letter came, she used her latch-key for the
first time. Not for a moment had the place seemed forlorn or
deserted. To her it was full of the man himself. All her
companionship with him was shut up there, and the future was
beginning to live there,&mdash;the future in which she couldn't
help believing. She came here by his wish; the quiet and comfort of
the place were his kindness. She was thus lifted up above the
sweating city streets because of his concern for her. Those ardent
early-summer days, with heat that still had an edge of freshness,
were glorious days for work. She had never had such a piano at her
command, or so definite a purpose to direct her.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The weeks flew by, but Lucy flew faster than they. The heavy
July heat made no drain on her vitality. This was the first summer
she had spent in the city, and she found it stimulating; no hotter
than Haverford, and God knew how much less dull! She seemed to be
carried along on a rushing river, and was constantly saluting
beautiful things on the shore. She couldn't stop to see them very
clearly, but they were there, flashing on the right or the left.
And when the morning was over, and she was tired, she was glad to
creep home through the heat and do her darning or put ribbons in
her nightgowns.</p>

<p>Auerbach had very few pupils in the summer months, and he gave
her a great deal of time. He liked to have her with him, and urged
her to spend her week-ends with his family. He had a house of his
own out on the South Shore, and a garden. From the first green of
spring, he rose very early and worked for two hours in his garden
before he went into the city to his classes. His wife got up and
made his breakfast, long before the children or the housemaid were
awake. She told Lucy that as you got older there wasn't so much you
could do for your husband any more, and it was nice to give him a
good breakfast while you had the house to yourself.</p>

<p>Auerbach inquired after Harry Gordon occasionally. He liked the
young man, and he had hopes for Lucy in that direction. She never
told him of Harry's marriage. She was hurt, though she pretended to
be scornful. He hadn't really a right to marry; he had belonged for
years to Lucy Gayheart!</p>

<p>One Sunday morning they were sitting in the shade under
Auerbach's grape arbour. Auerbach, in his shirt-sleeves, began to
question her.</p>

<p>"I think you have changed your mind, Lucy. You would rather go
on with the kind of work you do with Clement than teach?"</p>

<p>As Lucy made no reply, he continued.</p>

<p>"You must remember that Clement is very exceptional. Most
singers are not interesting to work with, and they don't want to
pay much. For the platform they always have a man."</p>

<p>Still Lucy said nothing. She bit her lip and looked out of the
end of the arbour at the yellow squash blossoms. Auerbach
smiled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have another plan, eh? The big Westerner? That
would please me very well."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Mr. Auerbach. That is only a friendship."</p>

<p>"Maybe so. But I wouldn't be sorry to see it come to something
else. In the musical profession there are many disappointments. A
nice house and garden in a little town, with money enough not to
worry, a family&mdash;that's the best life."</p>

<p>"You think so because you live in a city. Family life in a
little town is pretty deadly. It's being planted in the earth, like
one of your carrots there. I'd rather be pulled up and thrown
away."</p>

<p>Auerbach shook his head. "No, you wouldn't. I've heard young
people talk like that before. You will learn that to live is the
first thing."</p>

<p>Lucy asked him if there were not more than one way of
living.</p>

<p>"Not for a girl like you, Lucy; you are too kind. Even for women
with great talent and great ambition&mdash;I don't know. Some have
good success, but I don't envy them."</p>

<p>The next morning, when Lucy opened the windows in the studio and
looked across at the Lake, she told herself that she wasn't going
out to the Auerbachs' any more. It dampened her spirits. He was a
heavy, thorough, German music-teacher, and there he stopped.</p>

<h3>20</h3>

<p>Lucy often spent the long hot evenings in Sebastian's music
room, lying on the sofa, with the big windows open and the lights
turned out. And how strange it was that she should be there, after
all! Only last Christmas, when she went home, she had never been
inside this room, and had thought herself fortunate to catch a
glimpse of Sebastian coming out of the doorway downstairs.</p>

<p>This summer there would be no slowing-down to the village pace.
No walking about the town for hours and hours in the moonlight:
down to the post-office and home again; out to the little Lutheran
church at the north end. At this hour she used often to be sitting
on the church steps, looking up at that far-away moon; everything
so still about her, everything so wide awake within her. When she
couldn't sit still any longer, there was nothing to do but to hurry
along the sidewalks again; diving into black tents of shadow under
the motionless, thick-foliaged maple trees, then out into the white
moonshine. And always one had to elude people. Harry and the town
boys had their place, but on nights like this she liked to be
alone. She wondered she hadn't worn a trail in the sidewalks about
the Lutheran church and the old high school. She wondered that her
heart hadn't burst in those long vacations, when there was no human
image she could hold up against the summer night; when she was
alone out there, looking up at the moon from the bottom of a well.
She loved her own little town, but it was a heartbreaking love,
like loving the dead who cannot answer back.</p>

<p>Now the world seemed wide and free, like the Lake out yonder.
She was not always struggling against something, she was going with
something much stronger than herself. It was not that this new life
was without pain. But there was nothing empty or meaningless in it,
nothing that was not sweet to remember; not even that last night
when they had walked under the dripping trees and breathed in the
bitter darkness together.</p>

<p>From the very beginning there had been the shadow of some sorrow
over her love for this man, even before she knew him at all. When
she used to get only a glimpse of him now and then, on the street,
on the steps of the Art Museum, coming out of the Cathedral, it was
the look of loneliness and disappointment in his face that had
drawn her heart after him. Now, when he was far away, she sometimes
went into the church where the service for Madame de Vignon was
held and where she had seen Sebastian pray so long and fervently.
It was a place sacred to sorrows she herself had never known; but
she knelt in the spot where he had knelt, and prayed for him.</p>

<p>She heard from Sebastian occasionally, short notes, not
love-letters; a few words about his engagements or about her own
studies. There was always something meant for her alone; an
anecdote, a memory, a sentence about a place which had stirred
him&mdash;a human word. He kept her informed as to his itinerary,
so that she always knew where he was. He had finished his summer's
work in Munich, and was going to the Italian lakes for his
holiday.</p>

<h3>21</h3>

<p>One morning Mrs. Paul Auerbach came out into the garden and told
her husband that his breakfast was ready. It was September, and he
was cutting his grapes.</p>

<p>While she was bringing in his coffee he sat down and opened the
morning paper. She heard him call to her, and knew by his voice
that something terrible had happened. She ran into the dining-room.
Paul did not speak, but pointed to the newspaper spread out on the
table. Mrs. Auerbach saw the headlines and sank into a chair beside
him. Together they read the cablegram from Milan.</p>

<p>Yesterday Clement Sebastian and James Mockford were drowned when
their boat capsized in a sudden storm on Lake Como. There were
three in the boat, Sebastian, his accompanist, and Gustave Wiertz,
the Belgian violinist. The accident was seen from the shore, and
two row-boats immediately put out from Cadenabbia, but only Wiertz
was rescued. His account of the accident followed:</p>

<p>The breeze had stopped altogether, but they had not taken down
their sail. When the hurricane from the mountains broke upon them,
the boat was turned over immediately. Wiertz himself was struck by
the boom and thrown out a considerable distance. He sank, and when
he came up saw his two companions struggling in the water. He felt
no alarm for Sebastian, who was a strong swimmer. Mockford could
not swim and was apparently terrified; he had locked his arms about
Sebastian's neck. Wiertz thought Sebastian would be able to control
a man so much slighter, so he swam toward the boats coming out from
shore. The water was so cold that he was already growing numb, and
he did not look over his shoulder again. When he was pulled into
the first row-boat, the two heads had disappeared. The second
rescue party went on, believing that the two men might be clinging
to the overturned sail-boat. But they found no one. Mockford must
have fastened himself to his companion with a strangle-hold and
dragged him down. The bodies had not yet been recovered.</p>

<p>Auerbach looked at his watch. "My God, Minna, I must get to poor
Lucy before she sees this! It is not seven o'clock yet. I think she
never comes downstairs before eight."</p>

<p>"Wait, Papa, wait! I must go, too. I can put on my coat and go
like this. Oh, the poor child, the poor child!"</p>

<h2>BOOK II</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>It seemed as if the long blue-and-gold autumn in the Platte
valley would never end that year. All through November women still
went about the town of Haverford in the cloth tailored suits which
were the wear in 1902, with perhaps a little fur piece about the
throat; no one had thought of putting on a winter coat. The trees
that hung over the cement sidewalks still held swarms of golden
leaves; the great cottonwoods along the river gleamed white and
silver against a blue sky that was just a little softer than in
summer. The air itself had a special graciousness. Even people who
had some right to grumble that the rainfall had been scant and the
corn burned in the tassel, came out into their yards every morning
with the feeling that things would be better next year and life was
a good gamble.</p>

<p>On such a morning Mrs. Alec Ramsay, widow of one of the founders
of Haverford, was sitting by the wide window of her front parlour,
in her favourite tapestry winged-chair. She was an old woman now,
quite seventy, though the people of Haverford could scarcely
realize it; she had been a commanding figure in their lives for so
long. Moreover, she did not look her age; she was still erect and
handsome, there was something regal in her carriage and manner. Her
neighbours did remark that she had softened with time, had become
more reflective and sympathetic. Ten years ago she would not have
been sitting in a deeply cushioned chair at nine o'clock in the
morning of a fine autumn day. She would have been driving into the
country, or marketing on Main Street, or taking the fast train to
Omaha for a day's shopping. She still drove out, or walked, every
afternoon; but in the morning she was rather quiet, as if she had
to husband the energy that had once been an unfailing source. And
she was more interested in other people, all people, now than she
used to be. This morning she was looking out of her window to watch
the children go by on their way to school; little boys in
knee-pants and shirt-waists, little girls in starched gingham
dresses. "Run, Molly, run!" she called to a little fat one who came
scampering along just as the last bell began to ring.</p>

<p>When the bell stopped, and all the children of the town were
safely penned in three red brick schoolhouses, then the older
people came along, going to the post-office for their morning
mail:</p>

<p>Doctor Bridgeman's plump wife, who walked to reduce; Jerry
Sleeth, the silent, Seventh-day Advent carpenter; Father MacCormac,
the Catholic priest; flighty little Mrs. Jackmann, who sang at
funerals&mdash;and on every other possible occasion. One after
another they came along the sidewalk in front of the house, under
the arching elm trees, which were still shaggy with crumpled gold
and amethyst leaves.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Ramsay turned in her chair and spoke to her
daughter, Madge Norwall, who had come down from Omaha on a visit.
Mrs. Norwall was in the back room of the long double parlour,
knitting a sweater for a son in college.</p>

<p>"Madge, there goes Lucy Gayheart. She's so changed, poor child,
you'd scarcely know her. She never used to pass without looking
in."</p>

<p>The slender girl who was coming down the sidewalk did not glance
to right or left, nor could one say that she was looking before
her. She was definitely not looking at all, Mrs. Norwall thought.
Her head was bent forward a little and her shoulders were drawn
together, as if she were trying to slip past unnoticed. Mrs. Ramsay
could not let her go by like that; she leaned forward and tapped on
the window-pane with her big cameo ring. The girl stopped, flashed
a glance at the window, smiled, waved her hand faintly, and hurried
on.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ramsay watched the diminishing figure with a wistful,
anxious look in her still lovely blue eyes,&mdash;a blue that was
light and silvery clear, like the blue of sapphires. Lucy had
always walked rapidly, but with a difference. It used to be as if
she were hurrying toward something delightful, and positively could
not tarry. Now it was as if she were running away from something,
or walking merely to tire herself out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norwall had come into the front room and was looking out
over her mother's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it is," murmured Mrs. Ramsay. "Some people say it
was a love-affair in Chicago. And some say it is because she lost
her position there. I can't see her taking a thing like that much
to heart."</p>

<p>"And still others say," the daughter added, "that it's because
Harry Gordon jilted her and married Miss Arkwright."</p>

<p>"No such thing!" Mrs. Ramsay threw her head back with a flash of
her old fire. "If there was any jilting done, Lucy did it. He'd
have been glad enough to get her. I knew, the moment I saw them
together, he'd married this lantern-jawed woman out of pique.
Certainly Lucy is much too good for him."</p>

<p>"Harry's a grand business man, and he's very handsome," said
Mrs. Norwall teasingly.</p>

<p>"Handsome on the outside, perhaps. I should call it
fine-looking, myself. Rough Scotch at heart. I saw plenty of his
kind in Scotland; never too proud to save a shilling, for all their
swank and bluster."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norwall smiled and went on with her sweater. Mrs. Ramsay
looked out of the window and watched the people going by; nodded
and smiled if they happened to look in, but she scarcely saw them.
Her thoughts were elsewhere. Presently she sighed and said, as if
to herself:</p>

<p>"Whatever it was, I wish it hadn't happened. Poor little
Lucy!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Norwall glanced up from her work, almost startled by
something beautiful in her mother's voice. It was not the quick,
passionate sympathy that used to be there for a sick child or a
friend in trouble. No, it was less personal, more ethereal. More
like the Divine compassion. And her mother used to be so stormy,
<i>so</i> personal! If growing old did that to one's voice and
one's understanding, one need not dread it so much, the daughter
was thinking.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Lucy Gayheart hurried on with no particular thought in her mind
except that she would go home by another way; she would go up Main
Street as far as the old high school, and turn west a good four
blocks north of Mrs. Ramsay's. She had loved and admired Mrs.
Ramsay all her life, and for that reason she couldn't bear to see
her now. Once, since she first came home in September, Lucy had
stopped at Mrs. Ramsay's house, but it was all she could do to sit
through a short call. Her throat closed up, and her mind seemed
frozen stiff. Her old friend could not help her&mdash;only one
person in Haverford could help her. She was going to the
post-office now on the chance of seeing him, as she had gone on
many another morning. All the business men went for their mail at
about half past nine. Suddenly she remembered that the school-bell
had rung a long while ago. She might be too late; she hurried
faster.</p>

<p>The double doors of the post-office were hooked back because of
the warm weather. Men were going in and coming out. Lucy went to
her father's box and slowly turned the combination lock about,
purposely getting it wrong. She was waiting for someone. In a few
moments Harry Gordon came in. The bank lock-box was a little way
beyond Jacob Gayheart's. He passed behind Lucy without seeing her,
opened his box, and threw the letters into a leather bag he
carried. As he turned to leave, Lucy stood directly in his way.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Harry."</p>

<p>He looked up, pulled off his hat, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, <i>good</i> morning, Lucy!" As if he were very much
surprised to see her here; as if she had never been away and never
come back; as if there had never been any special friendship
between them. His voice had just that impersonal cordiality he had
with unimportant customers or their womenfolk. She might have been
a girl from one of the farms on which he held a claim he would
gladly be rid of. And his eyes seemed to look at her through thick
glasses, though he never wore any. Keen, sparkling, pale blue eyes,
as cold as icicles. He was not stiff with her,&mdash;perfectly
casual; and he went out of the post-office and down the street with
that easy, confident stride with which he used to go out on the
diamond in old baseball days, when he was the best pitcher in the
Platte valley and Lucy was a little girl watching from the
grand-stand.</p>

<p>Again and again since she came back to Haverford they had met
like this; and it was always just the same: the same affectation of
surprise, the same look, the same tone of voice&mdash;to one who
knew all the shades of his voice so well. If he had been
embarrassed or curt, she might have got round it. But there was no
breaking through this particular manner of his. Poor farmers
couldn't break through it when Harry proposed a settlement little
to their advantage and much to his own. He had a natural vigorous
heartiness which was as convincing as his fresh complexion. It was
so open and unlike the manner of a skinflint, that a slowwitted man
couldn't realize he had agreed to a hard bargain until it was over
and he was driving home in his wagon.</p>

<p>If she could only get a message to him, Lucy was thinking as she
walked away. She wanted little more than a friendly look when he
passed her on the street, the sort of look he used to give her,
careless and jolly. It would be enough if he would stop on the
street-corner occasionally and tell her a funny story in his real
voice, which very few people ever heard, and look at her with the
real kindness that used to be like a code sign between them
whenever they met.</p>

<p>Lucy did not go directly home, though she knew Pauline was
waiting for the morning paper. She went up to the north end of
town, to the little Lutheran church, and sat down on the steps. It
lay higher than the rest of Haverford, at the edge of the open
country, and one could look out over the low hills, chequered with
brown, furrowed wheat-fields, to the windings of the Platte River.
She sat down there because she was tired, and then she forgot to
think about the time. The sunlight fell warm on the wooden steps.
An osage orange hedge shut out the only house that was near by, and
the place was quiet and friendly. Presently she heard a
bell,&mdash;the school-bell! Then it must be eleven o'clock. She
hurried home as fast as she could.</p>

<p>Pauline was in the dining-room, setting the table. Lucy went
straight to her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I forgot to bring the paper home, Pauline. I went for
a walk and was gone longer than I meant to be."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right!" said Pauline in the cheery tone which
meant that it wasn't right at all.</p>

<p>Lucy put the paper down and went quickly upstairs to her own
room. Good heavens, why had she become so sensitive to people's
voices! Everyone she met spoke to her in an unnatural, guarded
tone. Her father's seemed to be the only honest voice in town.</p>

<p>Pauline called to her that lunch was ready. She came downstairs
and took her place at the table, opposite her sister. Mr. Gayheart
always lunched in town, at the Bohemian beer saloon. Pauline
brought in a platter of mutton chops; the coffeepot and vegetables
were already on the table. "Any important letters?" she asked as
she sat down.</p>

<p>"Important? No." Lucy supposed she must mean a letter calling
her back to Chicago.</p>

<p>Pauline chattered away. As a little girl Lucy had trained
herself to close her mind when her sister went rambling on. (Even
then it had seemed to her that most women talked too much.) Now, as
then, she tried to keep her mind on something outside the house.
Pauline had a very informal way of eating when they were alone;
neglected her food to talk, and then gobbled. Lucy couldn't dismiss
things of that kind lightly as she used to. They chafed her and
made her shrink into herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pauline came out with something which she really wanted
to say, and then Lucy heard her.</p>

<p>"There, I nearly forgot after all! Mrs. Ramsay telephoned and
said she very particularly wanted you to come in this evening. She
wants just you, because I was there last week, the day after Madge
came. You know we <i>all</i> liked Madge. Can you realize she has a
boy in college this year?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him. We called him Toddy. His real name was
Theodore, wasn't it? I suppose I'll have to go."</p>

<p>"Of course you will. You were always a special favourite."
Pauline gave a generous emphasis to this sentence. And it was
generous of her, Lucy admitted; for Mrs. Ramsay had always treated
Pauline like Pauline and Lucy like Lucy. But was generosity ever a
grace when it came with a pull? Wasn't it like the quality of mercy
and the gentle dew? Her sister broke in upon her reverie.</p>

<p>"Lucy, you're not eating anything again! That's why you've lost
your colour. You know, it's not becoming to you to be pale. There's
a new preparation of cod-liver oil&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucy interrupted her firmly. "Pauline, I took that medicine when
I first came home to please you, not because I thought it would do
me any good. It doesn't help people to eat when they are not
hungry. I worked too hard last summer, and had a kind of nervous
smash-up at the end of it. The only thing that will help me is to
be alone a great deal. That's why I came home, and why I don't go
to see people. That's why I begged you to leave the orchard, too. I
didn't lose my job, as some of our friends seem to think. My coming
away put Professor Auerbach to a great deal of trouble. But he
wouldn't let me try to work when I was sick."</p>

<p>"Well, Lucy," said Pauline as she began gathering up the dishes,
"that's the most reasonable explanation of things you've given me
yet. Of course I want to help you to get well. But if you expect
people to help you, you must tell them a little about what is the
matter. And you certainly have kept us in the dark."</p>

<p>"I know." Lucy spoke contritely, but she drew closer back within
herself and looked at the floor. "I'm not a very reasonable person.
You've had a good deal to put up with. I think I'm beginning to get
a little steadier."</p>

<p>Pauline had spoken kindly, and she still meant to be kind when
she went on:</p>

<p>"You must be plain and outspoken with your own folks, Lucy, and
not theatrical. We aren't that kind, and we don't know how to
behave."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand, Pauline." Lucy spoke very low. She was not
angry, but she went upstairs to her own room without once meeting
her sister's eyes.</p>

<p>A few moments later Pauline saw her go out of the house carrying
an old carriage robe, and disappear into the apple orchard behind
the garden.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>All afternoon Lucy lay in the sun under a low-branching apple
tree, on the dry, fawn-coloured grass. The orchard covered about
three acres and sloped uphill. From the far end, where she was
lying, Lucy looked down through the rows of knotty, twisted trees.
Little red apples still clung to the boughs, and a few withered
grey-green leaves. The orchard had been neglected for years, and
now the fruit was not worth picking. Through this long, soft,
late-lingering autumn Lucy had spent most of her time out here.</p>

<p>There is something comforting to the heart in the shapes of old
apple trees that have been left to grow their own way. Out here
Lucy could remember and think, and try to realize what had happened
to her: remember how the kind Auerbachs had come to her that
morning (long ago it seemed) and taken her home with them. Paul had
understood, without being told, that she must get away, must go
home, that she wished never to see Chicago again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Auerbach did all her packing for her, made explanations to
the bakery people, got her railway ticket, took Lucy to the train.
She had even made up a little package of "keepsakes" at Sebastian's
studio, before his lawyer came in to clean everything out; some of
the handkerchiefs left in his drawer, a pair of his gloves,
photographs of himself and his friends, a few of his books, scores
he had marked. She selected these things without consulting Lucy
and sent them by express to Haverford. They now lay in the bottom
of Lucy's trunk. They meant nothing to her; she couldn't bear to
look at them.</p>

<p>To have one's heart frozen and one's world destroyed in a
moment&mdash;that was what it had meant. She could not draw a long
breath or make a free movement in the world that was left. She
could breathe only in the world she brought back through memory. It
had been, and it was gone. When she looked about this house where
she had grown up, she felt so alien that she dreaded to touch
anything. Even in her own bed she lay tense, on her guard against
something that was trying to snatch away her beautiful memories, to
make her believe they were illusions and had never been anything
else. Only out here in the orchard could she feel safe. Here those
feelings with which she had once lived came back to her.</p>

<p>Her father's house was accounted comfortable; she could recall
that she used to take pride in it. But all those wooden dwellings
in Western towns were flimsily built,&mdash;built for people
without nerves. The partitions were too thin, especially between
the upstairs chambers. Her own room was next Pauline's. She could
not cry, or switch on her light, or turn over in bed, without
knowing that her sister heard her.</p>

<p>Out here in the orchard she could even talk to herself; it was a
great comfort. She loved to repeat lines from some of Sebastian's
songs, trying to get exactly his way of saying the words, his
accent, his phrasing. She tried to sing them a little. It made her
cry, but it melted the cold about her heart and brought him back to
her more than anything else did. Even that first air she ever
played for him, "Oh that I knew...where I might find Him..." she
used to sing it over and over, softly, passionately, until she
choked with tears. But it helped her to say those things aloud to
her heart, as if something of him were still living in this world.
In her sleep she sometimes heard him sing again, and both he and
she were caught up into an unearthly beauty and joy. "So shall the
righteous shine forth as the sun in their heavenly Father's realm."
It was like that, when she heard him in her sleep.</p>

<p>But sometimes she was afraid of sleep, and did not go to bed,
but sat up in a little chair by the window for hours rather than
take that chance. There had been nights when she lost consciousness
only to drop into an ice-cold lake and struggle to free a drowning
man from a white thing that clung to him. His eyes were always shut
as if he were already dead; but the green eyes of the other, behind
his shoulder, were open, full of terror and greed. She awoke from
such dreams cold and exhausted with her struggle to break that
cowardly embrace. Then she would lie awake for the rest of the
night, shivering. Why had she never told Sebastian she knew this
man was destined to destroy him? Why hadn't she thrown herself at
his feet and pleaded with him to beware of Mockford, that he was
cowardly, envious, treacherous, and she knew it!</p>

<p>After one of these terrible nights Lucy was afraid to trust
herself with anyone. A very little thing might shatter her
self-control. She would come out here under the apple trees, cold
and frightened and unsteady, and slowly the fright would wear away
and the hard place in her breast grow soft. And now the orchard was
going to be cut down; the old trees were feeling the sun for the
last time this fall.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Just behind the orchard was the pasture where Mr. Gayheart used
to graze a horse, in the days when he kept one. Two years ago
Pauline had this field ploughed up and planted in Spanish onions.
She marketed very profitable crops, and that sealed the fate of the
orchard.</p>

<p>Lucy had been at home only a few weeks when she was awakened one
morning by the sound of an ax. She listened languidly for a moment,
then suddenly realized that it wasn't somebody chopping wood. The
sound was not like that at all; there was no vibration. The ax was
cutting into something alive. She sprang out of bed, caught up a
dressing-gown, and ran to her father's big room at the back of the
house, which looked out over the yard and the orchard. Her father
was in the bathroom, shaving. From his window she could see a man
in the orchard, cutting down an apple tree. She ran down the back
stairs to the kitchen, where Pauline was getting breakfast, and
told her to go out to the orchard, quick! Someone was cutting a
tree.</p>

<p>Pauline looked sidewise out of her rather small eyes. Her voice
was not quite natural as she tried to answer carelessly.</p>

<p>"I told Poole to come today, but I didn't tell him to come so
early. I'm sorry if he wakened you."</p>

<p>"But what's the matter with the tree? Why is he cutting it?"</p>

<p>Pauline broke an egg into the hot saucepan. "Hadn't I told you
we are going to clear away the old orchard?"</p>

<p>"Clear away&mdash;Oh, where is Father?"</p>

<p>Startled by the frantic note in her sister's voice, Pauline
pushed the eggs to the back of the stove and turned round.</p>

<p>"Father has agreed to it. You surely must know, Lucy, that he
turns in very little money toward the running of this house. My
onion crops have done a good deal for us. I am having the orchard
cut down this fall and the ground prepared, so that I can put it
into onions and potatoes in the spring. I can't be going out to the
farms all the time to look things over, and I'm sure the tenants
cheat me. But here I can have a crop under my eyes and make a good
thing of it. I have to turn some trick, to keep the place
going."</p>

<p>"But, Pauline, don't do it this fall. Don't do it now, when I'm
so miserable!"</p>

<p>"Try to be reasonable, Lucy. I've made all the arrangements, and
if I put it off I lose a year's crop."</p>

<p>Lucy was still scarcely awake. She caught Pauline's chubby hand
and broke out wildly: "I can't stand it, I can't! It's all I have
in the world just now. Leave it this year, and I'll pay you back
what you lose, truly I will. I'll soon be making money again, and
I'll pay you every cent. Pauline, go out and send that man away!
Listen, it's down! He'll begin on another. I can't stand it!" Lucy
dropped into a chair, and her head sank upon her bare arms on the
kitchen table. Her hair was hanging in two braids over her
shoulders which were shaking with bitter sobs. Pauline frowned
darkly, but her own eyes filled with tears. She couldn't doubt the
desperateness of Lucy's distress, and she looked so helpless. Not
since she was a child had she ever begged for anything like that.
Pauline bent over the table and gave her sister an awkward,
spasmodic hug.</p>

<p>"There, there, Sister. I didn't know you would take it so hard.
I'll let it stand till next fall. But won't you feel just the same
about it then?"</p>

<p>Lucy lifted her face. "I won't be here then. I'll be off making
my living, somewhere. I know you have to make up for Father's easy
ways." She said this very low, and swallowed a lump in her throat.
"But if you'll just&mdash;just humour me this year, you'll never be
sorry. Some time you'll understand."</p>

<p>"All right, my dear. I'll go and send Poole away. And you go
upstairs now and put your clothes on. Take this cup of coffee
along, and drink it while you dress."</p>

<p>Lucy took it with gratitude, and went up the back stairs slowly,
meekly, like a child who has been whipped until, as they say, its
will is broken.</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs, before the door of his bedroom, stood
a man who was also afraid of Pauline. He was freshly shaven, in a
clean shirt, with bay rum on his greying hair and goatee. He took
the coffee-cup from Lucy, put it on his dresser, and then took her
in his arms. He kissed her with love, as he always did when he
kissed her at all, on her lips and eyes and hair. He said not a
word, but, keeping his arm around her, went with her to her own
door, carrying the coffee.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>As Lucy was coming in from the orchard just before sunset, she
found Pauline waiting for her on the back porch, with a cape over
her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Lucy, you'll take cold, you shouldn't be out there after four
o'clock without a coat on. I never could make you wear clothes
enough when you were little. It's just the same now. Mrs. Ramsay
called up again and wants to speak to you. You will have to go
there tonight."</p>

<p>Lucy said she supposed she must. There was only one thing she
really liked to do in the evening. She and her father had been
playing some sonatas of Mozart after he came home from the shop. He
had a harsh tone on the violin, but he seemed to enjoy playing with
her so much that she enjoyed it, too.</p>

<p>After supper she walked toward the town and turned into the
street that people jokingly called Quality Street, because Mrs.
Ramsay lived at one end of it and the Gordons at the other. Mrs.
Ramsay was sitting in her high-backed chair beside the big front
window, the shades up and the silk curtains drawn back. This had
always been her way, though her house was so near the sidewalk that
every passer-by could gaze in; her neighbours sometimes said it
looked as if she were giving a reception to the street. As a little
girl Lucy had loved to come to this house; such comfortable rooms,
old-fashioned furniture, and soft, flowered carpets. She used to
like the feeling that here there was a long distance between the
parlour and the kitchen, that they were not always being mixed up
together as they were at home. Mrs. Ramsay was then the only woman
in town who kept two maids; now Mrs. Harry Gordon kept a man and
his wife, Pauline had told her.</p>

<p>Lucy kissed Mrs. Ramsay's cheek and sat down at her side, on the
bamboo stool with the red cushion where she used to sit when she
was learning to crochet. Nothing ever changed in this house, and
there was something in the air of it that one was glad to come back
to. The house had some reality, had colour and warmth, because the
woman who made it and ruled it had those things in her nature.</p>

<p>"Lucy, dear, you aren't treating me as well as you always used
to. Have I grown too old for you, at last?"</p>

<p>Lucy murmured that she didn't like to visit her friends when she
was dull and out of sorts. She had stayed in the city and worked
all summer, and that didn't turn out very well. "When fall came, I
was not good for anything. My teacher's wife packed my things for
me&mdash;and I let her do it, think of that!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ramsay patted her hand. So it wasn't that Lucy had
displeased her teacher and been sent away, as some people said.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, if you don't feel like talking, you might come
in and play for me sometimes. I had the piano tuned as soon as I
heard you were home. And there it stands. Madge never touches
it."</p>

<p>Lucy brightened. "Would you like that? I think I would! We have
only the old upright at home, you know. The one in father's shop is
a little better, but it bothers me to have people coming in and
out. I didn't use to mind it when I was a girl."</p>

<p>"A girl? Good gracious, what are you now, I'd like to know? No,
you mustn't practise much while you are at home. You look tired, my
dear, and you walk tired. You need a long rest in country air, and
there's no air like the Platte valley. Denver's too high, and
Chicago's too low. There are no autumns like ours, anywhere. The
fall we spent in Scotland, I count lost out of my life. Mr. Ramsay
would have it, and he got enough of it!"</p>

<p>Yes, Lucy said, she was glad to be at home. A whole year of the
city had been too much.</p>

<p>"But it was a good year, wasn't it? You must have been enjoying
your work, or you wouldn't have stayed. And I hope you had plenty
of fun along with it. I don't like to see young people with talent
take it too seriously. Life is short; gather roses while you may.
I'm sure you gathered a few."</p>

<p>Lucy smiled indulgently. "A few."</p>

<p>"Make it as many as you can, Lucy. Nothing really matters but
living. Get all you can out of it. I'm an old woman, and I know.
Accomplishments are the ornaments of life, they come second.
Sometimes people disappoint us, and sometimes we disappoint
ourselves; but the thing is, to go right on living. You've hardly
begun yet. Don't let a backward spring discourage you. There's a
long summer before you, and everything rights itself in time."</p>

<p>Lucy sat wondering why it was she could not talk to her old
friend. On her way down here tonight, she had been thinking she
would ask Mrs. Ramsay to summon Harry Gordon to this very parlour
some afternoon (no one refused any request of hers), to give her a
chance to talk with him, and to be present at the interview. But
now she found she couldn't do it. She rose with a sigh and went
over to the piano.</p>

<p>She played for nearly an hour. She liked playing on this piano
again; it was the only good one in town. Long ago she had supposed
it must be one of the best in the world. Mrs. Ramsay sat straight
in her high-backed chair, her elbow on the arm, her head resting
lightly on the tips of her fingers.</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Ramsay turned and looked out of the window, she would
have seen a man's tall figure go somewhat pompously by. (The blind
was still up, and the interior of the lighted room was as clear to
the passer-by as a stage setting when the theatre is dark.) At the
corner he did not go straight north as his way led, but turned and
walked west, along the sidewalk that bordered Mrs. Ramsay's flower
garden and carriage-house. He had been seized by a fierce impulse
to go straight to her front door and into the parlour,&mdash;he
almost did it. Now he meant to walk round the block and look in on
that scene again. But by the time he reached the west corner he had
recovered himself, and he resumed his way north. It had only
knocked him out of his course one block, his pride told him; that
wasn't much of a knock!</p>

<p>In little towns, lives roll along so close to one another; loves
and hates beat about, their wings almost touching. On the sidewalks
along which everybody comes and goes, you must, if you walk abroad
at all, at some time pass within a few inches of the man who
cheated and betrayed you, or the woman you desire more than
anything else in the world. Her skirt brushes against you. You say
good-morning, and go on. It is a close shave. Out in the world the
escapes are not so narrow.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Lucy returned from her call on Mrs. Ramsay in a cheerful mood
and went to bed. At about four o'clock in the morning Pauline was
awakened by a cry of fright in the next room, a cry of pleading and
terror. Then there was a smothered whimpering that made her shiver.
Once a puppy, run over by a wagon in front of their house, had
cried like that.</p>

<p>It was not the first time Lucy had cried in her sleep. Usually
she soon wakened, and then Pauline could hear her turning in bed
and changing her pillows. She had never gone in to speak to her
sister; she was afraid, really. There was something the matter with
Lucy, no doubt of that, and Pauline was glad she had let the apple
orchard alone. It must be good for her to be out there in the
sun.</p>

<p>In her own way Pauline loved her sister, though there had been
moments when she certainly hated her. Personal hatred and family
affection are not incompatible; they often flourish and grow strong
together. Everything that was most individual and characteristic in
Lucy she resented; but she was loyal to whatever she thought was
Gayheart. When someone praised Lucy's playing, Pauline usually
said: "Oh, yes, all the Gayhearts are musical! If my voice had been
cultivated..." Pauline was the soprano and director of the Lutheran
choir.</p>

<p>Pauline was a much more complex person than her sister: her
bustling, outright manner was not quite convincing, for all its
vehemence. One felt that it had very little to do with her real
feelings and opinions&mdash;whatever they might be. She was, so to
speak, always walking behind herself. The plump, talkative little
woman one met on the way to choir practice, or at afternoon teas,
was a mannikin which Pauline pushed along before her; no one had
ever seen the pusher behind that familiar figure, and no one knew
what that second person was like. Indeed, Pauline told herself that
she "put up a front." She thought it very necessary to do so. Her
father was queer, not at all like the real business men of the
town; and Lucy, certainly, was not like other people. Someone had
to be "normal" (a word Pauline used very often) and keep up the
family's standing in the community.</p>

<p>When Lucy was a child, Pauline was very fond and proud of her,
as if she were a personal ornament reflecting credit on herself.
She was only eighteen when her mother's death left Lucy entirely to
her care. Friends and neighbours often praised the way in which she
brought the little girl up. Pauline had loved looking after her,
indeed, though she was often perplexed by the child's wild bursts
of temper and her trick of running away. It was not until Lucy was
old enough to go to high school that Pauline began to be jealous of
her. Then she realized that everyone, even the Lutheran pastor and
the Frau Pastor, had one manner with her and another one with Lucy.
Mrs. Ramsay and Harry Gordon's mother were always sending for Lucy
on one pretext or another. Pauline was asked to their houses only
when they gave a church supper, or a benefit for the firemen. And
Lucy's father spoiled her; that was Pauline's sorest jealousy. If
at breakfast she told Lucy to come directly home after school and
help her with the ironing, Mr. Gayheart was very apt to say that
she must stop first at the shop and do her practising.</p>

<p>After months of brooding, Pauline went into her father's room
one Sunday afternoon and told him she would like to have a talk
with him. Was she to go on having all the care of the house, now
that Lucy was old enough to share it? Was that fair to her, or good
for Lucy?</p>

<p>Mr. Gayheart put down his newspaper and turned in his chair to
face his daughter.</p>

<p>"It is more important that she does her music well and sits at
the piano where I can watch her. If there is too much to do here,
get one of Kohlmeyer's daughters to help you. You can get one for a
dollar a day."</p>

<p>Pauline protested that it was not herself, but Lucy she was
thinking of. Was it good for a girl to grow up heedless, and always
to be waited on?</p>

<p>"I mean her to grow up at the piano. She will do more good
there, and that is where she belongs." Gayheart took up his paper
again.</p>

<p>"The piano is in the parlour," Pauline said to herself, as she
went back to her own room. "It has always been like that; the
parlour cat and the kitchen cat."</p>

<p>Mr. Gayheart thought his elder daughter a girl of good common
sense; she must see that Lucy was different, everybody saw that;
therefore she should make no fuss about it.</p>

<p>Harry Gordon was less obtuse. He knew that Pauline was jealous.
Whenever he met her on the street, or when she came into the bank
on business, he made a point of being cordial, and he always sent
her a big box of candy at Christmas time. He seldom went to the
house, however, even to see Lucy; merely called for her to take her
for a drive or to a dance.</p>

<p>Pauline knew she would be quite as popular in the town as Lucy,
if she were as pretty. Indeed, she was popular. People said:
"Pauline is levelheaded." Since that was the role she affected, she
shouldn't have minded. But she did mind, very much. People were
always stopping her on the street to ask when Lucy would be back
from Chicago. The old ladies beamed at her with expectant eyes when
they said how pretty Lucy was growing, as if Pauline should beam,
too. She did her best, but a rather greenish, glow-worm gleam it
was.</p>

<p>Lucy had never been aware of any of these hidden feelings in her
sister. Her thoughts ran outward, and she was usually all aglow
about something, if it were only the weather. She hadn't the least
idea of what Pauline was really like&mdash;never considered it.
Pauline had brought her up, taken care of her when she was sick,
made birthday and Christmas parties for her. Pauline was "good,"
and good people were usually fussy and a little tiresome. Home, for
some reason, was a place where she never felt entirely free, except
in the orchard and the attic. Though Lucy would stoutly have denied
such a charge, the truth was that Pauline's housekeeping was more
pretentious than efficient. In spite of her bustling manner Pauline
was really, like her father, very indolent.</p>

<p>Where there is one grievance, there are likely to be many.
Pauline had never felt that her father could afford to send Lucy
away to study. Lucy had earned nothing during her first two winters
in Chicago. Mr. Gayheart paid for her lessons and her living
expenses. That was why he was always short of money, and why
Pauline had to raise onions. If Lucy had been apologetic and
humble, and had practised small economies, she would have been less
to blame in her sister's eyes. But not at all; she never seemed to
think about money. When she had any, she spent it gaily. She
refused to be poor in spirit. One expectation had enabled Pauline
to put up with Lucy's easy ways and to endure this alarming drain
on the family resources. The one thing Lucy could have done to
repay her family for the "sacrifices" they had made for her would
have been to marry Harry Gordon. Pauline had counted on that, and
now it had come to nothing&mdash;worse than nothing. People were
feeling sorry for the Gayhearts. Pauline held her chin high, but
her pride smarted at the thought that Lucy had been jilted. She was
jealous of Lucy and for Lucy at the same time.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Lucy was going slowly along the street in the centre of the
town, approaching the Platte Valley Bank. She had in her handbag a
draft from Chicago, for the balance she had left on deposit there.
She had been carrying this draft about for more than a week,
passing and repassing the bank in the hope of seeing Harry Gordon
at the cashier's window and surprising him before he could retreat
to his private office. This morning she looked in once again as she
went by; Milton Chase, the young cashier, was at the window. Lucy
walked deliberately on to the end of the main street, and went into
the Union Pacific railway station.</p>

<p>After lingering about the waiting-room for a while, reading the
posters, she walked back to the bank. There stood Harry in the
cashier's cage. It was bound to happen some time. She went in
quickly, straight to the window.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Harry. Can I open a very small account with you
while I am at home?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly! Milton," he called over his shoulder to his
cashier, "a moment, please."</p>

<p>Milton came, and Harry stepped aside and motioned him to the
window. Then he spoke directly to Milton, in his best business
manner. "Miss Gayheart wants to open an account with us. Just fix
her up with a pass-book. And I want you to give her your personal
attention. Anything we can do to accommodate her, we'll be glad to
do, you understand." With this he left the cage.</p>

<p>Lucy did not know what followed, except that she came out of the
bank with a pass-book and a little cheque-book in her bag. So this,
too, had failed.</p>

<p>She had thought if she could confront Harry at the window she
would have courage to ask him to see her in his private office for
a moment, and she would tell him&mdash;she did not know exactly
what. Perhaps she would make him understand that she had told him a
falsehood in the dining-room of the Auditorium that night. And she
would ask him if he couldn't feel kindly toward her, for old times'
sake, and speak kindly when they happened to meet. That was all she
wanted, and it would mean a great deal to her.</p>

<p>And why, she wondered, as she walked home blindly, her eyes
turned inward, would it mean so much? She didn't know. Perhaps it
was an illusion, like the feeling she had in Chicago that if she
once got home she wouldn't suffer so much. Perhaps it was because
he was big and strong, and a little hard. He knew the world better
than anyone else here, he had some imagination. He rose and fell,
he was alive, he moved. He was not anchored, he was not lazy, he
was not a sheep. Conceited and canny he was most days of the month;
but on occasion something flashed out of him. There was a man
underneath all those layers of caution; he wasn't tame at the core.
If he should put his hand on her, or look directly into her eyes
and flash the old signal, she believed it would waken something and
start the machinery going to carry her along.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>Crazy little Fairy Blair came home for Thanksgiving. On the very
day she arrived she ran after Lucy on the street, in a grass-green
cap and sweater.</p>

<p>"Hello, Lucy, wait a minute!" she called. Catching up with Lucy,
she took her arm. "I'll walk along with you. I have a trade-last
for you. One of my fraternity sisters has a brother studying with
Professor Auerbach, Sidney Gilchrist, do you know him? He says
Auerbach is crazy about you, and tells everyone you're his star
pupil. Doesn't that please you? Oh, you're so haughty, always! And
oh, Lucy! That Mr. Saint Sebastian who was drowned in Italy, wasn't
he the singer you played for?"</p>

<p>Lucy had not heard that name spoken since she left Chicago.
"Yes, he was." She could feel Fairy's sharp, mischievous little
eyes.</p>

<p>"Terrible thing, wasn't it? Died trying to save a lame man, the
paper said. Weren't you dreadfully upset? It must have been
thrilling to play for him. Sidney said it put you in the upper
circle all right!"</p>

<p>Fairy had heard that no one in town knew what was the matter
with Lucy, and she thought she had a clew. That same afternoon she
telephoned Pauline and asked her to come in for tea. (They called
it tea, but it was always coffee and cake.) Fairy made haste to
tell Pauline about the accident on Lake Como, and what Sidney
Gilchrist had written his sister; that Lucy was desperately in love
with Sebastian, and Professor Auerbach had been afraid she would go
out of her mind.</p>

<p>Pauline went home very much relieved. Her sister had been here
nearly three months, and this was the first hint she had got as to
what had really happened. At least, it wasn't so bad as some people
thought; the man hadn't jilted her. Pauline believed that to be
jilted was almost the worst thing that could befall a respectable
girl. Now she knew what to think of that moaning she sometimes
heard at night; a shock like that would probably give one bad
dreams.</p>

<p>She felt sorry for Lucy,&mdash;and a little in awe of her, for
the first time in her life. Women like Pauline have a secret
respect for romantic chapters. Lucy had been dignified, she
reflected; she hadn't run about telling her troubles. She should,
of course, have confided in her sister. She behaved strangely. Yet
she, Pauline, would behave just so under similar circumstances; she
was sure of it. Lucy was certainly a Gayheart.</p>

<p>When Pauline entered the house she greeted her sister in her
usual cheery tone, but she was conscious of a certain awkwardness.
Lucy was setting the table for supper, so Pauline came into the
dining-room and sat down for a moment.</p>

<p>"Are you going to do anything special this evening?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I thought I might go down to play for Mrs. Ramsay. It's
Saturday night, so Father will go back to the shop after
supper."</p>

<p>"Lucy," Pauline began in a deeply confidential tone, "I don't
know what we ought to do about Mrs. Harry Gordon."</p>

<p>"Do about her? Why, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She's never returned my call. I can't think why. Maybe she is
waiting for you to call, before she returns mine. She coming here a
bride, and we being old residents, perhaps she expects us all to
come."</p>

<p>"Father too?"</p>

<p>"Now don't be contrary, Lucy! We who live here have to consider
such things."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know. But I shan't go to see her until she has been
to see you. Let's let it rest at that."</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>As Lucy had been lost by a song, so she was very nearly saved by
one. Two weeks before Christmas a travelling opera company, on
their way to Denver to sing for the holiday season, gave a single
performance in Haverford. Lucy had noticed the posters as she came
and went about the town, but she hadn't even stopped to read them.
One evening at the supper table her father took three blue tickets
from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Girls, I think we must go to hear The Bohemian Girl next
week."</p>

<p>From his manner Lucy could see that he was looking forward to
this entertainment. He began asking her to tell him about the
operas she had heard in Chicago. Pauline remarked that the "local
talent" was to give Pinafore in February.</p>

<p>"That Gilbert and Sullivan stuff, I can't see much in it," said
Mr. Gayheart. "If you want something light and amusing, now, there
is Die Fledermaus. Or La Belle Helene. You never heard it, Lucy? I
was crazy about that opera when I was a boy. The Bohemian Girl is a
little old-fashioned, maybe, but it's very nice."</p>

<p>On the evening of the performance Mr. Gayheart came home early.
He took a bath and shaved very carefully, put on his best black
suit, a white waistcoat, and his patent-leather shoes. When he came
downstairs before supper, his daughters knew he expected to be
admired.</p>

<p>"Do put on your new evening dress, Lucy. It will please him,"
Pauline whispered as they went to their rooms.</p>

<p>Lucy had meant never to wear that dress again, but she relented.
Her father had so little to make him feel gay.</p>

<p>When they were getting ready to start, a light snow began to
fall, and Mr. Gayheart was fearful for his patent leathers. He put
his hand affectionately on Lucy's bare shoulder. "A little shawl or
something, maybe, to carry along? I don't want you to take cold
down there."</p>

<p>Lucy straightened his black necktie and slipped her arm around
his neck for a moment, remembering the days in his shop when he
used to keep his ear on her practising while he looked through a
glass into the insides of watches.</p>

<p>Mr. Gayheart set off through the snow flurry, a daughter on
either arm. He liked to reach the Opera House early and watch the
people come in. (The theatre in every little Western town was then
called an opera house.) On the way he told Lucy the manager of the
house had put in folding chairs in place of the old straight-back
wooden ones; otherwise she would find the hall just the same as
when she played on the stage for her own commencement exercises,
nearly four years ago.</p>

<p>When the conductor, who was also the pianist, appeared, Mr.
Gayheart settled back with satisfaction, and the curtain rose on
the hunting scene. The chorus was fair, the tenor had his good
points; but before the first act was over, the three Gayhearts were
greatly interested in the soprano. She was a fair-skinned woman,
slender and graceful, but far from young. She sang so well that
Lucy wondered how she had ever drifted into a little road company
like this one. Her voice was worn, to be sure, like her face, and
there was not much physical sweetness left in it. But there was
another kind of sweetness; a sympathy, a tolerant understanding.
She gave the old songs, even the most hackneyed, their full value.
When she sang: "I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls," she glided
delicately over the too regular stresses, and subtly varied the
rhythm. She gave freshness to the foolish old words because she
phrased intelligently; she was tender with their sentimentality, as
if they were pressed flowers which might fall apart if roughly
handled.</p>

<p>Why was it worth her while, Lucy wondered. Singing this humdrum
music to humdrum people, why was it worth while? This poor little
singer had lost everything: youth, good looks, position, the high
notes of her voice. And yet she sang so well! Lucy wanted to be up
there on the stage with her, helping her do it. A wild kind of
excitement flared up in her. She felt she must run away tonight, by
any train, back to a world that strove after excellence&mdash;the
world out of which this woman must have fallen.</p>

<p>It was long before Lucy got to sleep that night. The wandering
singer had struck something in her that went on vibrating;
something that was like a purpose forming, and she could not stop
it. When she awoke in the morning, it was still there, beating like
another heart. Day after day it kept up in her. She could give her
attention to other things, but it was always there. She felt as if
she were standing on the edge of something, about to take some
plunge or departure.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>The day before Christmas opened with a hard snow-storm. When the
Gayhearts looked out of their windows the ground was already well
covered, the porches and the hedge fence were drifted white. At
breakfast Mr. Gayheart said that when he went down to make the
furnace fire at six o'clock, the snow must have been falling for
some time.</p>

<p>Lucy spent the morning tramping about in the storm on errands
for Pauline. She took boxes of Christmas cakes to all their old
friends, carried a pudding in its mould out to the Lutheran
pastor's house at the north end of town, where there was no
sidewalk and she had to wade through deep snowdrifts. The storm
brought back the feeling children have about Christmas, that it is
a time of miracles, when the angels are near the earth, and any
wayside weed may suddenly become a rose bush or a Christmas
tree.</p>

<p>Pauline was delighted to see Lucy so like herself again. She
invented errands to keep her going. But late in the afternoon she
thought her sister looked tired, and sent her upstairs to her own
room to rest until supper time.</p>

<p>Lucy did not feel tired, she was throbbing with excitement, and
with the feeling of wonder in the air. She put the blinds up high
and sat down in a rocking-chair to watch the bewildering, silent
descent of the snow, over all the neighbours' houses, the trees and
gardens. She was alone on the upper floor. The daylight in her room
grew greyer and darker. Lights in the house across the street began
to shine softly through the storm. She tried to feel at peace and
to breathe more slowly, but every nerve was quivering with a
long-forgotten restlessness. How often she had run out on a spring
morning, into the orchard, down the street, in pursuit of something
she could not see, but knew! It was there, in the breeze, in the
sun; it hid behind the blooming apple boughs, raced before her
through the neighbours' gardens, but she could never catch up with
it. Clement Sebastian had made the fugitive gleam an actual
possession. With him she had learned that those flashes of promise
could come true, that they could be the important things in one's
life. He had never told her so; he was, in his own person, the door
and the way to that knowledge.</p>

<p>Tonight, through the soft twilight, everything in her was
reaching outward, straining forward. She could think of nothing but
crowded streets with life streaming up and down, windows full of
roses and gardenias and violets&mdash;she wanted to hold them all
in her hands, to bury her face in them. She wanted flowers and
music and enchantment and love,&mdash;all the things she had first
known with Sebastian. What did it mean,&mdash;that she wanted to go
on living again? How could she go on, alone?</p>

<p>Suddenly something flashed into her mind, so clear that it must
have come from without, from the breathless quiet. What
if&mdash;what if Life itself were the sweetheart? It was like a
lover waiting for her in distant cities&mdash;across the sea;
drawing her, enticing her, weaving a spell over her. She opened the
window softly and knelt down beside it to breathe the cold air. She
felt the snowflakes melt in her hair, on her hot cheeks. Oh, now
she knew! She must have it, she couldn't run away from it. She must
go back into the world and get all she could of everything that had
made him what he was. Those splendours were still on earth, to be
sought after and fought for. In them she would find him. If with
all your heart you truly seek Him, you shall ever surely find Him.
He had sung that for her in the beginning, when she first went to
him. Now she knew what it meant.</p>

<p>She crouched closer to the window and stretched out her arms to
the storm, to whatever might lie behind it. Let it come! Let it all
come back to her again! Let it betray her and mock her and break
her heart, she must have it!</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>On Christmas Day Lucy wrote to Paul Auerbach to wish him a happy
New Year, and to tell him that she wanted to go back to him, if he
had any work for her to do. "I have found out that I can't run away
from my own feelings," she wrote. "The only way for me, is to do
the things I used to do and to do them harder."</p>

<p>An answer came from him the following week; a long, kind letter
which must have taken most of his Sunday morning. He and Mrs.
Auerbach were greatly relieved to hear that she felt this change.
The young man who had taken over Lucy's pupils when she left so
suddenly had been promised his position until the first of April,
when he was going abroad to study. If Lucy would come on about the
middle of March, she could stay with them, and Mrs. Auerbach would
help her to find a room and get comfortably settled before she went
to work. "You will have a warm welcome in the house of your old
friend and teacher, Paul Auerbach."</p>

<p>Lucy had hoped she could go at once. Perhaps by March she would
have lost her courage and be sunk in apathy again. But she could
not ask her father for money, not with Pauline's narrow eyes always
watching. She must look out for herself from now on, and she could
do it. She must wait.</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p>Lucy thought she ought to begin to study again, so she tried
going to her father's shop every day and working on the sample
piano. But Jacob Gayheart did not keep his ear open as he used to.
He had gone backward in his music: he neglected it for chess. Soon
after Christmas he had fallen away from playing duets with Lucy in
the evening. He said he had to stay later at the shop, but his
daughters knew that he was playing chess by telephone with a
celebrated player who was visiting a cousin in North Platte. To be
sure, he didn't often have a chance to match his skill with such an
opponent.</p>

<p>Mr. Gayheart had let the shop get so dusty that it wasn't a
pleasant place to practise in. The space round the piano was full
of broken music-stands and brass instruments that were never
cleaned, and the walls were hung with dusty band uniforms. It
embarrassed Lucy when people came in for watches and clocks that
should have been repaired weeks ago.</p>

<p>If she stayed at home to practise, there were so many things to
put her out. She was restless now, and trifles got on her nerves.
No matter how orderly she managed to keep her own room, she
couldn't help being aware that just on the other side of that thin
partition her sister's room was in confusion. There was no doubting
it, for Pauline left her door open. It was Pauline's custom not to
make her bed until noon; she managed to get out of it in the
morning without throwing off the blankets, leaving it like a
mole-hill, with the very shape of her body.</p>

<p>"Lucy," she said one morning, "what's got into you, to be
turning your mattress and sweeping your room every day? You never
used to be so fussy."</p>

<p>"A little Italian showed me how a sleeping-room ought to be
kept. I learned something besides music last winter," Lucy replied
as she went downstairs.</p>

<p>Pauline squinted. That remark nettled her, really hurt her
feelings. She kept recalling it for days afterwards.</p>

<p>Lucy did what she could on the shop piano in the morning, and
every afternoon she walked; through the town, and out the road to
the north, where the land lay high and she could look down over the
Platte valley. She began to notice things about the country that
she had never taken much heed of before. She believed she was
bidding the country good-bye this winter, and that made her eye
more searching. One thing she watched for, every afternoon. Long
before sunset an unaccountable pink glow appeared in the eastern
sky, about half-way between the zenith and the horizon. It was not
a cloud, it had not the depth of a reflection: it was thin and
bright like the colour on a postcard. On sunny afternoons it was
sure to be there, a pink rouge on the hard blue cheek of the sky.
From her window she could watch this colour come above the tall,
wide-spreading cottonwood trees of the town park, where her father
led the band concerts in summer. Did that pink flush use to come
there, in the days when she was running up and down these
sidewalks, or was it a new habit the light had taken on?</p>

<p>If there was anyone in Haverford who could tell her, it would be
Harry Gordon. He was the only man here who noticed such things, and
he was deeply, though unwillingly, moved by them. When she used to
go duck-shooting with him she had found that he knew every tree and
shrub and plant they ever came upon. Harry kept that side of
himself well hidden. He could feel things without betraying
himself, because he was so strong. If only she could have that
strength behind her instead of against her! It was more than
physical strength; it was something that could keep up to the
bitter end, that could take hold and never let go. She was so
without any such power that even to think of it heartened her a
little. Perhaps some day they would be friends again. He was
conceited and hard to teach, but she believed he would go on
learning about life; because he had more depth than the people
around him, and never pretended to like anything he didn't like.
Quite the other way; he played at being a common fellow, and he
wasn't. He was full of that energy which moves quietly, but always
moves. It might get a man almost anywhere, she thought. And the
people who hadn't it, even those with nice tastes, like her father,
never got anywhere.</p>

<h3>10</h3>

<p>The weeks can be very long in the Platte valley, Lucy found. She
began to feel trapped, shut up in a little town in winter. That
long, soft, brooding autumn had been like a kind companion. Now the
hard facts of country life were upon her. The weather grew windy
and bitter cold; the town and all the country round were the colour
of cement. The tides that raced through the open world never came
here. There was never anything to make one leap beyond oneself or
to carry one away. One's mind got stuffy, like the houses.</p>

<p>Toward the end of January came another heavy snowfall; then a
thaw, followed by a week of biting cold. The street, the roads, the
yard, the orchard, were stretches of lumpy ice and frozen snow. Why
didn't Professor Auerbach send for her now? If she could only walk
past the Arts Building once again, see the hall porter, and George,
the elevator man! If she could go to the concert hall where she had
first heard Sebastian; sit in a corner, and remember! Some day she
would be able to rent his old studio, and she would live there
always. There must be ways of making money in this world; she had
never seriously tried, but now she would.</p>

<p>One morning Pauline went to help the Methodist women get the
basement of the church ready for a chicken-and-waffle supper, so
Lucy practised at home. She had found she could, if she were alone
in the house. At noon Pauline came in, resolutely cheerful (her
sister was a hard person to live with just now). When they sat down
to lunch, she announced what she believed to be good news.</p>

<p>"Lucy, my dear, I've done pretty well for you this morning. I've
got two piano pupils for you."</p>

<p>Lucy looked up and grew red.</p>

<p>"Pupils? I don't want any. I am not going to teach in
Haverford."</p>

<p>Pauline didn't flush; she grew paler. "But seriously, Lucy,
don't you think you ought to be doing something? You must know that
Father gets deeper into debt all the time. We made a great
sacrifice to send you away to study. I always supposed you'd want
to pay back at least part of what it cost us."</p>

<p>"I will, some time. I can't see that anybody made a great
sacrifice. It was Father's own idea that I should study music. I
was never extravagant, certainly. I got along on less than most of
the students."</p>

<p>Her careless tone made her sister indignant.</p>

<p>"More than sixteen hundred dollars you cost us in those first
two years. I have the cheque stubs, and I know."</p>

<p>"So much as that?" Lucy asked in the same indifferent
manner.</p>

<p>"That is a great deal, for us. You might have sent back just a
little after you began to earn something, to show good
intentions."</p>

<p>"I thought of it, but I bought clothes instead. When I was
teaching I had to be decently dressed."</p>

<p>Both the sisters had stopped eating and both were making a
pretence of drinking coffee. Pauline went on to say, as mildly as
she could, that she had thought Lucy would like to take a few
pupils, now that she was feeling better. "People here have always
appreciated you. I wonder you haven't had applications before this.
I'm afraid some of Fairy Blair's talk must have got around."</p>

<p>Lucy knew that she could go away and avoid a scene, but she
didn't care.</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean?" she asked coldly.</p>

<p>The same thing happened to Pauline's face that happened to sour
milk when she poured boiling water into it to make cottage cheese;
it clabbered, the flesh curdled.</p>

<p>"The stories about you and that singer. Such things will get
out, and Fairy isn't one to keep them. Now people are saying that
when Harry Gordon went to Chicago last spring and saw how things
were, he threw you over."</p>

<p>Lucy laughed disagreeably. "Threw me over, did he? Well, one
story's as good as another. I don't care what they say. So you kept
Father's cheque stubs, Pauline? How like you! You needn't worry.
I'm going back to teach under Auerbach again. It's been arranged
for weeks. The date is set for March, but I can easily go sooner."
She had risen and was standing against the light of the window.</p>

<p>Pauline broke out bitterly. "Lucy, why are you so mean! Why do
you hide things from us, and treat us like strangers?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I feel that way," Lucy said as she went up the back
stairs.</p>

<p>While Pauline was washing the dishes she cried a little, shed a
few waxy tears that came hard. You brought a child up, slaved for
her and dressed her prettily, did all the work and let her have all
the holidays (the parlour cat and the kitchen cat!)&mdash;and this
was what came of it. You coddled her as if she were a superior
being, and she treated you like the housekeeper. And she used to be
so proud of her little sister!</p>

<p>When Pauline left the kitchen and came into the sitting-room,
she looked out of the window to see who might be passing. Why,
there was Lucy! In her hat and coat, out of doors, out in the road,
hurrying away from the house and walking toward the country. And
she was carrying something, in a black bag. Could it be her
skating-shoes?</p>

<p>Pauline caught up a shawl and ran out into the yard.</p>

<p>"Lucy!" she called; then louder: "Lucy, wait!"</p>

<p>But Lucy never turned. She seemed, indeed, to quicken her pace.
Pauline went back into the house. "Just the way she used to run off
when she was little!" She dropped her shawl. "I wonder if she knows
the old skating-place was ruined last spring when the river changed
its bed? She'll have her walk for nothing."</p>

<p>Surely she wouldn't be crazy enough to try the ice out there?
The bank had been torn up by the flood, and anyone could see that
the river itself now flowed where the shallow arm used to be.
Pauline considered telephoning the livery man to drive out after
Lucy and tell her she wouldn't find any skating. But Lucy might be
very much annoyed at any such interference. Probably it was the
walk she wanted. Pauline remembered how she used to shut her eyes
to Lucy's truancies; the child usually got over her tempers out on
the highroad, but if she were shut up for a punishment it only made
her worse.</p>

<h3>11</h3>

<p>Lucy found the walking bad enough. The roads had been rutted
during the thaw, and afterwards the deep cuts made by the
wagon-wheels had frozen hard. Yesterday's snowfall had packed into
them. Her foot kept catching in the walls of the ruts. On either
side of the wheel-tracks the mud had frozen in jagged ridges, rough
and sharp like mushroom coral. Since yesterday few countrymen had
been abroad, and the horses' hoofs had not yet broken down these
frozen incrustations. Lucy couldn't remember that her feet had ever
got so cold when she was walking; but this was not walking, really,
it was plodding, and breaking through.</p>

<p>She was going west, directly against the wind, and she had often
to turn and stand still to catch her breath. After she was a mile
out of town, not a single sleigh or wagon passed her. It was still
too early for the farmers who had gone to town in the morning to be
driving homeward. The country looked very dreary, certainly. If
only the sun would break through! But it made a mere glassy white
spot in the low grey sky. In that cold light even the fresh snow
looked grey, and the frozen weeds sticking up through it. In the
draws, between the low hills, thickets of wild plum bushes were
black against the drifts; they should have been thatched with
yesterday's snow, but today's sharp wind had stripped them
bare.</p>

<p>After the first mile Lucy began to feel very tired. The wind
seemed to blow harder out here in the open country; it brought the
tears to her eyes, and she had to keep wiping them away to see the
road clearly. At last she determined to beg a ride from anyone who
came by, even if he were going toward town. It was almost too cold
to skate; and there would be the long walk home.</p>

<p>She had got over another mile when she heard the sound of
sleigh-bells behind her. She turned her back to the wind, and
listened. Only one man in the country had such bells. It must be
Harry Gordon. There was no place to hide; she wouldn't hide.
Perhaps this was the chance she had been hoping for. She stepped
behind a telephone post and waited. She felt even colder than
before, and her heart beat fast. She was afraid, after all. There
he came in his cutter, over the brow of a hill, down into a draw
where he was lost to sight, then out on the very hill upon which
she was standing. She stepped into the middle of the road, in front
of him, and held up her hand. He pulled in his horses and
stopped.</p>

<p>"Harry, could you give me a lift as far as Thompson's pasture? I
find it's pretty rough walking." She was standing with her back to
the wind, her skirts blown forward, holding her muff against her
cheek. She looked very slight and appealing out there all
alone.</p>

<p>Harry's eyes were watery from the cold; he seemed more than ever
to look at her through glasses. He began in that voice of cheery
friendliness which meant nothing at all, with the usual shade of
surprise in it:</p>

<p>"Well, now, I'm just awfully sorry, but I'm not going out that
way at all! I turn north right here at the corner. I have an
important appointment with a man up in Harlem. I'm nearly an hour
late as it is, and I've got to make up time on the road. Wish I
weren't in such a hurry." He touched his fur cap with his glove and
drove on.</p>

<p>Lucy sent just one cry after him, angry and imperious, "Harry!"
as if she had the right to call him back. His big shoulders never
moved. His sharp-shod horses trotted on, the sleigh-bells singing,
and turned north at the section corner a hundred yards away. The
cutter with the upright seated figure moved along against the grey
snow-drifted pasture land until at last it disappeared behind a
group of distant straw stacks.</p>

<p>When Lucy next stopped to take breath, she found herself a long
way nearer the river bend. For a moment she had leaned against the
telephone post back yonder, but only for a moment. Such a storm of
pain and anger boiled up in her that she felt strong enough to walk
into the next county. Her blood was racing, and she was no longer
conscious of the cold. She forgot to look where she put her feet;
they took care of themselves.</p>

<p>She couldn't have imagined such rudeness, such an insult! She
was young, she was strong, she would show them they couldn't crush
her. She would get away from these people who were cruel and
stupid&mdash;stupid as the frozen mud in the road. If she let
herself think, she would cry. She must not give in to it, she must
hurry on.</p>

<p>When she reached the river bank she sat down just long enough to
take off her walking-shoes, and put on the other pair with skates
attached. Her hands trembled so that she could scarcely pull the
leather laces taut and tie them. She was angry with herself, too.
That she should have given him the chance to leave her in the road,
as he had left her in the dining-room that night in Chicago! But
how could anyone be armed against such boorishness and spite?
Catching up a stick, she got to her feet and took a few long
strokes close to the shore. She was not looking about her, she saw
nothing&mdash;she would get away from this frozen country and these
frozen people, go back to light and freedom such as they could
never know.</p>

<p>Without looking or thinking she struck toward the centre for
smoother ice. A soft, splitting sound brought her to herself in a
flash, and she saw dark lines running in the ice about her. She
turned sharply, but the cracks ran ahead of her. A sheet of ice
broke loose and tipped, and she plunged to her waist into cold
water.</p>

<p>Lucy was more stimulated than frightened; she had got herself
into a predicament, and she must keep her wits about her. The water
couldn't be very deep. She still had both elbows on the ice; as
soon as she touched bottom she could manage. (It never occurred to
her that this was the river itself.) She was groping cautiously
with her feet when she felt herself gripped from underneath. Her
skate had caught in the fork of a submerged tree, half-buried in
sand by the spring flood. The ice cake slipped from under her arms
and let her down.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>At half-past three, when the wind had grown so bitter, Pauline
telephoned her father to drive out and pick Lucy up on the west
road. Mr. Gayheart went to the livery barn a few doors from his
shop and told Gullford, the driver, to put in two horses. Then he
asked his friend the tailor to go with him for a sleigh-ride. Mr.
Gayheart was not a man to look for trouble. But as they drove on
and on and still did not meet his daughter, he grew uneasy.</p>

<p>When they reached the place on the shore from which the young
people used to go skating, they found the ice out in the stream
cracked and broken. So she couldn't have tarried here. She must
have taken some other road, or gone to pay a call at one of the
farms. The driver noticed something, out where the ice was bad; he
said it looked like a red scarf.</p>

<p>Mr. Gayheart jumped out of the sleigh. He contradicted Gullford,
but begged him to look again, to go out on the ice.</p>

<p>"I'm a little afraid to go out there, Mr. Gayheart; it's rotten.
But don't get excited. Stay where you are, and I'll have a look
around."</p>

<p>Gullford went slowly along the shore, considering what was to be
done. He knew that was a scarf out there. Presently he stopped and
bent over. Under a willow bush at the river's edge he found a pair
of shoes and overshoes. He called Schneider, the tailor, and asked
him to stay here with Mr. Gayheart while he whipped up his team and
went to the neighbouring farms for help.</p>

<p>In less than an hour farm wagons and sleds were coming toward
the river, bringing ropes, poles, lanterns, hay-rakes. One wagon
brought a heavy row-boat that had been used in times of freshet. It
was already dark, and the men who had come together agreed they
could do nothing until morning. Mr. Gayheart kept begging them to
try, declaring that he would not leave the river bank that night.
While the older men talked and hesitated, four young lads dragged
the old boat out into the rotten ice and groped below with their
poles and hay-rakes. It did not take them a great while. The sunken
tree that had caught Lucy's skate still held her there; she had not
been swept on by the current.</p>

<p>When Harry Gordon and his singing sleighbells came over the
hills from Harlem that night, he overtook a train of lanterns and
wagons crawling along the frozen land. In one of those wagons they
were taking Lucy Gayheart home.</p>

<h2>BOOK III</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>One winter afternoon, twenty-five years after Lucy Gayheart's
death, the good people of Haverford met at the burying-ground for
another funeral. Mr. Gayheart's body had been sent home from the
hospital in Chicago where he had gone for an operation. It was four
o'clock in the afternoon, an unusual hour for a funeral, but the
hour had been determined by the arrival of the railway train. The
coffin was taken from the express car to the Lutheran church in an
automobile hearse (these are modern times, 1927), and after a short
service it was brought to the graveyard.</p>

<p>Scarcely anyone could remember so large a funeral. Old Mr.
Gayheart, as he had been called for years now, had many friends.
Since Pauline's death, five years ago, he had gone on living in his
own house, with one of the tailor's daughters as his housekeeper.
He had kept his shop open, and he continued to practise a little on
his clarinet, though he complained that his wind was failing him.
On Sundays, in summer, he sometimes practised out in the old
orchard&mdash;which had never been cut down.</p>

<p>He had lived a long and useful life, people were thinking as
they walked, or drove slowly in their cars, out to the cemetery.
Almost every timepiece in Haverford was indebted to him for some
attention. He was slow, to be sure, but to the end he was a good
workman. Last night, when they wound their watches, many a one of
his old customers paused and wondered; tick, tick, the little thing
in his hand was measuring time as smartly as before, and old Mr.
Gayheart was out of the measurement altogether.</p>

<p>By four o'clock the graveyard was black with automobiles and
people. The cars formed a half-circle at some distance away, and
their occupants, except the old and feeble, got out and stood
around the open grave. The grey-haired business men had once been
"band boys." The young men had taken lessons from Mr. Gayheart even
after he stopped leading the town band. His older pupils looked
serious and dejected; how many memories of their youth went back to
the music-teacher who had lived so long, and lived happily, in
spite of misfortunes!</p>

<p>It was sad, too, to see the last member of a family go out; to
see a chapter closed, and a once familiar name on the way to be
forgotten. There they were, the Gayhearts, in that little square of
ground, the new grave standing open. Mr. Gayheart would lie between
his long-dead wife and his daughter Lucy; the young people could
not remember her at all. Pauline they remembered; she lay on Lucy's
left. There were two little mounds in the lot; sons who died in
childhood, it was said. And now the story was finished: no
grandchildren, complete oblivion.</p>

<p>While the prayers were being read, someone whispered that it was
almost as if Lucy's grave had been opened; the service brought back
vividly that winter day long ago when she had been laid to rest
here, so young, so lovely, and, everyone vaguely knew, so unhappy.
It was like a bird being shot down when it rises in its morning
flight toward the sun. The townspeople remembered that as the
saddest funeral that had ever drawn old and young together in this
cemetery.</p>

<p>By the time the grave was filled in and the flowers were heaped
over it, the sun had set, and a low streak of red fire burned along
the edge of the prairie. The crusted snow in the open fields turned
rose-colour. The automobiles began slowly to back out, and the
people who had come on foot turned their steps homeward. In the
company walking toward the town, one man withdrew from the
slow-moving crowd. Forsaking the road, he struck off alone across a
fenced pasture; a tall man of solid frame, walking deliberately,
his hands in the pockets of his overcoat, his head erect, his
shoulders straight. To a stranger he would have given an impression
of loneliness and strength&mdash;tried and seasoned strength. He
has need of it, for he has much to bear.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Harry Gordon went directly from the cemetery to his bank and
called up his house by telephone. The maid answered. Would she tell
Mrs. Gordon that he must finish up some business he had laid aside
to go to the funeral. He would have supper sent in from the hotel
and would not be home until late.</p>

<p>This done, he went through a hallway to his private office. The
first Gordon bank in Haverford was a wooden building. When the
brick bank was built, Harry's father had the old building pushed
back to the rear, and for years used it as a storehouse. Harry,
after his marriage, had fitted it up for a study and private
office. At first it had looked like any country lawyer's office;
oak tables, shelves that held old ledgers and financial reports.
Gradually, almost stealthily, he had made it more comfortable, and
as the years went on he spent more and more time there. The room
was heated by the bank furnace, but he had put in a fireplace where
he burned coke when the steam got low after banking hours.</p>

<p>This evening when he came in, Gordon lit a fire before he took
off his overcoat. He unlocked a cupboard, got out his whisky and a
siphon of soda, and sat down by the fire. Pouring himself a drink,
he swallowed it slowly. Then he lit a cigar and with a long sigh
settled deep into his chair. His well-set, vigorous frame relaxed.
As he lay against the leather cushions he looked tired,&mdash;tired
and beaten.</p>

<p>He had just buried the last close personal friend he had in the
world. He was not, he thought with a grim smile, likely to make new
ones at fifty-five. How differently life had turned out from the
life young Harry Gordon planned in the days when he used to step
out on the diamond to pitch his famous in-curve, with all the boys
and girls calling to him from the bleachers!</p>

<p>For the last eight years he had played chess with old Mr.
Gayheart two or three evenings every week. He had become a good
chess-player, quite Gayheart's equal. After Pauline's death left
the old man alone, Gordon managed to drop in at his shop every day,
if only for a moment. Chess had become one of his fixed habits.
They played in Gayheart's shop, never at the house. They talked no
more than good chess-players usually do. Gordon had watched games
between players of international renown when he was abroad during
the war, and Mr. Gayheart liked to hear him tell of them over and
over.</p>

<p>Like many other men whose lives were dull or empty, Harry Gordon
"threw himself," as the phrase went, enthusiastically into war
work; Red Cross, Food Conservation. Finally he went over himself
with an ambulance unit which he had helped to finance. He was gone
for eight months, and his wife took his place as president of the
bank and manager of all his business interests. That was probably
the happiest period of her life; she was a born woman of
affairs.</p>

<p>For Gordon himself that absence did a great deal; ever since he
came back the townspeople had felt a change in him. His friendship
with old Mr. Gayheart grew closer and warmer&mdash;like a son's
regard, indeed. At home he played his part better. He and his wife
seemed more companionable; went out together, had guests to dinner.
The air in their big, slippery-floored many-bathroomed house was
not so chill as it used to be. And in business Gordon was more
consistent. For some years before he went away he had brought on
himself a reputation for eccentricity; this had gone so far as to
affect his credit. At one time he would be sharp and tricky, barely
keeping inside the law. At another he would let everything go, as
if he felt a contempt for his business and were shuffling it off in
the easiest way. Conservative men had begun to doubt his
judgment.</p>

<p>Since his return from France he had devoted himself seriously to
the bank, as his father had done, and he became more like his
father. You knew where to find him now, Milton Chase said. There
had been a stretch of time back there when Gordon's erratic
decisions wore his cashier thin and bald.</p>

<p>Milton Chase probably knew more about his chief than anyone else
did, but he didn't pretend to understand him. He had found it very
agreeable to work under Mrs. Gordon. She was a reasonable woman.
When he gave her the facts about any proposition that came up, he
could pretty well tell in advance what she would think about it.
But Harry had sprung too many surprises on him. On the surface
there was perfect accord between Gordon and his cashier, but deep
down Milton was chafed by a secret distrust. What was he to think
when one of the most self-centred of men began to give not only his
time but his money to the Red Cross? And worse was to follow. On
the morning when Harry called Milton into the room behind the bank
and told him that he was going to France with the hospital unit,
the cashier went to pieces and said he didn't know whether he could
face his responsibility; he'd have to take a few days off and think
it over.</p>

<p>In the course of the years queer things had happened which
Milton could never explain; things which were out of order, which
ought not to occur in business. For instance, a shocking scene had
come about when they were foreclosing on Nick Wakefield. Nick had
been one of the gay young fellows who used to play about with Lucy
Gayheart. He inherited a big farm from his father, but he was a
town boy, didn't like heavy work, and he failed as a farmer. When
the bank was shutting down on him, Nick nerved himself with plenty
of alcohol and came in to have it out with Harry Gordon. The game
was up, and he might as well have his say. It was a very unseemly
thing to occur in a bank. Nick was full of bitter talk. He made
several ugly accusations, more or less true, and ended with a taunt
which brought the cold sweat out on Milton's brow, as he sat trying
to look small in his cage.</p>

<p>"You're ready to hit a man when he's down," Nick shouted,
clenching his fists and standing up to Harry, "but you're a damned
coward, for all your big chest. Afraid to go to poor Lucy
Gayheart's funeral, weren't you, big man? Beat it for Denver! I
guess there was a reason, all right!"</p>

<p>Milton had expected the ceiling to fall&mdash;he prayed that it
might. But what happened was stranger. Gordon made figures on his
desk pad for a moment. Then he turned in his chair and looked at
Nick. He spoke to him in a voice that was really kind, without any
contemptuous jollying in it:</p>

<p>"There are some names I wouldn't mention in your state of
health, Nick. You're loaded, and you'll be sorry for this tomorrow.
Come in then and finish what you have to say to me."</p>

<p>The bank sold Nick Wakefield out, but on terms more lenient than
Milton Chase thought proper.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Harry had been sitting before the fire for nearly an hour when
he switched on the lights and telephoned the hotel to send over
some sandwiches. He dispatched them quickly and put the tray in the
outer hall. Tonight was an occasion for remembering; he felt it
coming on. Years ago he used to fight against reflection. But now
he sometimes felt a melancholy pleasure in looking back over his
life; he had begun to understand it a little better.</p>

<p>He, and he only, knew why he had been so brutal to Lucy Gayheart
when she came home. It was not because of what she had told him
that night after the opera in Chicago.</p>

<p>He had regretted his hasty marriage at the end of the first
week; indeed, he was already regretting it when he made it. He knew
that he was hurting himself in order to hurt someone else. He was
doing the one thing he had sworn he never would do, marrying a
plain woman, who could never feel the joy of life. Harriet
Arkwright had her good points; she was not crude, she had some
experience of the world. She was intelligent and executive. It was
she who built their new house in Haverford, managed the builders
and workmen without trouble or confusion, furnished it exactly as
she wished&mdash;and paid for it. The house made a common interest,
they were both pleased with it. She was reasonable, she had no
irritating affectations. It would be possible to rub along, Harry
thought. Then Lucy came back to town.</p>

<p>He knew, the first time he saw her in the post-office, that
nothing had changed in him; more than ever before he knew what he
wanted. She was standing in that crowd of slovenly men, clouds of
tobacco smoke drifting about her, slowly turning the combination
lock of her father's letter-box. As he stared in from the door the
line of her figure made his heart stop. She looked so slight, so
fine, so reserved&mdash;He had turned like a flash and walked
rapidly down the street, without going inside to face her. But that
glimpse of her, standing in profile with one hand lifted, had been
enough.</p>

<p>Afterwards, from day to day, he had to see her at a distance,
pass her on the street. That grace of person appeared more marked
now, when she was withdrawn, than in the days when she had been
careless and gay. She seemed gathered up and sustained by something
that never let her drop into the common world. As she went about
the town, her head a little bent, her glance veiled, she was
sometimes spiritless and uncertain, as if she were beginning to
walk abroad after a long illness; but she was unapproachable. That
intense preoccupation, and her brooding look, were very sad to see
in one so young. But they protected her, kept her aloof and alone.
The boys she used to dance and picnic with were afraid to go to see
her now. It was only when she met Harry Gordon that her eyes
lighted up with the present moment, and asked for something. They
never looked at him that they did not implore him to be kind.</p>

<p>He knew that she was unhappy, that she wanted him to help her.
Her voice had a note of pleading if she but said
good-morning&mdash;he gave her very little chance to say more. She
was a creature of impulse, he knew; never could conceal her
feelings. Perhaps she never tried. She made it clear that she had
some desperate need of him; it followed him back to his desk after
these chance meetings. Was it that she had "got into trouble" as
some people whispered, and the man had deserted her? He didn't
know, he didn't care. He knew that if he were alone with her for a
moment and she held out her hands to him with that look, he
couldn't punish her any more&mdash;and she deserved to be
punished.</p>

<p>He was in the first year of a barren marriage (barren in every
sense; his wife never had a child), and the life he would have
lived with Lucy was always in the back of his mind then. She had
ruined all that for a caprice, a piece of mawkish sentimentality.
Let her suffer for it. God knew he did! So he used to think, when
he left her on a street-corner looking after him.</p>

<p>And yet, underneath his resentment and his determination to
punish, there was a contrary conviction lying very deep, so deep
that he held no communication with it. After they had both been
punished enough, something would happen, how he didn't know; he
might break with this town and all the guarantees of his future,
but he and Lucy Gayheart would be together again.</p>

<p>A man who is young and strong looks forward. If he has been a
fool and thwarted his own will&mdash;that is temporary. Every
morning when he goes out into the air, he knows he is going to have
his way; feels resourceful enough to leave all his blunders behind
him. In those months after Lucy came back to Haverford, Harry had
never doubted what the end would be. That would come about without
contriving on his part&mdash;would come because it had to. When he
passed her on the street or had to say good-morning to her in the
post-office, the certainty of his ultimate mastery stirred in him
like something alive. When the hour struck, nothing could stop
him.</p>

<p>That evening when he passed Mrs. Ramsay's window and saw Lucy at
the piano, and the old lady listening with her head resting on her
fingertips, he had scarcely got himself by. He had so nearly gone
into that house. Then he would have walked home with Lucy, and
everything would have come right.</p>

<p>Why was it that such terrible and unusual things should happen
to a prudent, level-headed man? Why, when he came back from Harlem
that night, with miles of open country all about, did he have to
meet that little procession of lanterns and wagons crawling along
over the snow? Why had he been compelled actually to drive in that
procession? He couldn't pass it,&mdash;not after he had stopped and
asked what was the matter. He took off his sleigh-bells and walked
his horses into town after the wagon train. There was nothing else
to do.&mdash;When he reached home he went directly into the
library, where his wife sat writing letters. He shut the door
behind him and asked her if she knew what had happened at the
river. Yes, Milton Chase had called up to tell him as soon as the
news reached town, and she had answered the telephone.</p>

<p>"I am going west tonight on the Union Pacific two-o'clock, and I
will not be back until after the funeral. I treated that girl very
badly not long ago. I've not said a kind word to her since she came
home. I can't go to the funeral; I'm not hypocrite enough. But I
want you to go. The family would be hurt if neither of us were
there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon frowned slightly. She was always self-possessed,
never made scenes. Then she said in her cool, well-regulated
voice:</p>

<p>"Your leaving town will be commented on, probably? I can't see
the point of my going to the funeral alone."</p>

<p>"It's the first favour I've ever asked of you."</p>

<p>"No need to put it in that way. I don't know the people, but if
you think it's the proper thing to do, I'll go, of course."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Harriet." He went to his room to pack his bag.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>There was not, in all the world, a living creature who knew of
his last meeting with Lucy on the frozen country road beside the
telephone post. For days, weeks, after his return from Denver,
people talked about the "tragedy," as they called it; in the bank,
on the street, wherever he went. He suspected they took care to
discuss the subject before him. There was, of course, the dark
whisper that it might have been suicide. The cuts on her wrists and
hands showed that she had struggled to cling to the ice; but she
might have lost courage after her plunge. She was last seen alive
by a Swede farmer who had passed her on the west road, about a mile
from town. Everyone knew she had been low-spirited and unlike
herself since she came home. Fairy Blair had brought the story that
some singer Lucy was in love with had been drowned in Italy in the
summer; like enough she had resolved to put an end to herself in
the same way. Even if no one had happened to tell her that the
river had changed its bed last spring, couldn't she see for
herself? The whole west bank was torn up, and the island was much
farther from the shore than it used to be.</p>

<p>These discussions never drew a remark from Harry Gordon, and no
one had quite the courage to ask him how he happened to go to
Denver the night Lucy was brought home. "Let's see; you met them on
the road when they were bringing her in, didn't you, Harry?" That
was as far as the boldest got.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Gordon put some more coke on the fire, walked to the window, and
stood looking up at the bright winter stars. These things he had
been remembering mattered very little when one looked up there at
eternity. And even on this earth, time had almost ceased to exist;
the future had suddenly telescoped out of the past, so that there
was actually no present. Kingdoms had gone down and the old beliefs
of men had been shattered since that day when he refused Lucy
Gayheart a courtesy he wouldn't have refused to the most worthless
old loafer in town. The world in which he had been cruel to her no
longer existed.</p>

<p>Life would have been much easier for him, certainly, in those
years after Lucy's death, if he could have told someone about his
last meeting with her. Many a time, going home on winter nights, he
had heard again that last cry on the wind&mdash;"Harry!"
Indignation, amazement, authority, as if she wouldn't allow him to
do anything so shameful.</p>

<p>Yes, he had had a long grilling. He was tough, but it had been a
match for him. Luckily for him, the automobile had come along soon
after the turn of the century. He owned the first car in the
county, and, as they were improved, he bought one car after
another. His farms were scattered far and wide, and he lived on the
road. He often went to Denver for the week-end, "driving like the
devil." He got into the habit of thinking aloud as he drove;
talking, indeed, to his motor engine. Once when he had his wife
along, he forgot himself and came out with: "Well, it's a life
sentence."</p>

<p>That was the way he used to think about it. Lucy had suffered
for a few hours, a few weeks at most. But with him it was there to
stay. He understood well enough why she hadn't noticed the change
in the river; he knew what pain and anger did to her. It was that
very fire and blindness, that way of flashing with her whole self
into one impulse, without foresight or sight at all, that had made
her seem wonderful to him. When she caught fire, she went like an
arrow, toward whatever end.</p>

<p>As time dragged on he had got used to that dark place in his
mind, as people get used to going through the world on a wooden
leg. He made a great deal of money, he bought great tracts of
land&mdash;rather a joke on him, now that land values were going
down. But such things had kept him busy in the years when he needed
distraction. His friendship with Mr. Gayheart had been a solace. It
was somewhat like an act of retribution. Those evenings over the
chess-board had come to be the best part of his week. He had grown
to like the old man's shop better than any place in town. They
never talked of Lucy, but the piano on which she used to practise
still stood there.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Gordon was thinking, as he sat in his study on that night of Mr.
Gayheart's funeral, how the sense of guilt he used to carry had
gradually grown paler. For years he had tried never to think about
Lucy at all. But for a long while now he had loved to remember her.
Perhaps it was no great loss to have missed two-thirds of her life,
if she had the best third, and had been young,&mdash;so heedlessly
young. Of course she would fall in love with the first actor or
singer she met, and would declare it openly. That would soon have
passed. One might have foretold such adventures for Lucy, from her
eyes, and from her laugh,&mdash;her low, rich, contralto laugh that
fell softly back upon itself. It was not the laughter of nervous
excitement; it was bubbling and warm, but there was a veiled note
of recklessness in it.</p>

<p>In spite of all the misery he had been through on her account,
Lucy was the best thing he had to remember. When he looked back
into the past, there was just one face, one figure, that was
mysteriously lovely. All the other men and women he had known were
more or less like himself.</p>

<p>He sometimes thought of those mornings when she used to get up
before daylight to go duck-shooting with him on the river: the
heavy silence over the dew-drenched fields, the dark sound of the
water, the quick flush of dawn in the east and the waking of the
breeze in the tops of the cotton-woods, the birds rising in the
pearl-coloured air. And at his elbow something eager, alert,
happier than he could ever be.</p>

<p>It was a gift of nature, he supposed, to go wildly happy over
trifling things&mdash;over nothing! It wasn't given to him&mdash;he
wouldn't have chosen it; but he liked catching it from Lucy for a
moment, feeling it flash by his ear. When they stood watching the
sun break through, or waiting for the birds to rise, that
expectancy beside him made all his nerves tingle, as if his
shooting-clothes, and the hard case of muscle he lived in, were
being sprayed by a wild spring shower. His own body grew
marvellously free and light, and there was a snapping sparkle in
his blood that made him set his teeth.</p>

<p>In the absolute stillness of the night (it was getting toward
twelve), Gordon heard the bank telephone ringing again and again.
That would be his wife, calling up to know what had become of him.
He did not answer the telephone, but he covered the last glowing
lumps of the coke fire, put on his overcoat, and started for
home.</p>

<p>He is not a man haunted by remorse; all that he went through
with long ago. He enjoys his prosperity and his good health. Lucy
Gayheart is no longer a despairing little creature standing in the
icy wind and lifting beseeching eyes to him. She is no longer near,
beside his sleigh. She has receded to the far horizon line, along
with all the fine things of youth, which do not change.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>The day after Mr. Gayheart's funeral was Sunday. Harry and his
cashier, Milton Chase, met at the bank by appointment, to go for a
walk. People looked out of their windows to see them go by.</p>

<p>Everyone is used to the fact that Milton seems older than Harry.
When his youthful good looks withered, they left his cheeks thin
and his nose too long. He walks jerkily, with short uneven steps,
as if he had left some unfinished business behind him. Harry still
has the firm, deliberate tread with which he has come and gone
about these streets for nearly a lifetime.</p>

<p>The two men are going "out to the Gayhearts'," as people still
say. The town has not grown in these twenty-five years, it has
shrunk. The old Gayheart place is still half-farm, lying at the
extreme west edge of Haverford, where the sidewalk ends. Beyond,
there is only country road. It is a walk Gordon often takes on a
Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>When he was a young lad, newly come to Haverford with his
father, one summer evening he was riding out that road on his
bicycle. The cement gang had been at work there all day, laying
this very sidewalk which was never to go any farther. They had
finished smoothing the wet slabs, stretched mason's cord on low
stakes all about them as a warning to passers-by to keep off, and
gone home for supper. When Harry came along on his wheel, he
noticed a slip of a girl in boy's overalls, barefoot, running about
the flower garden, watering it with a length of rubber hose.
Instantly he recognized her as the same girl he had seen in the
skating-rink, gliding about to the music in her red jersey. He got
off his bicycle and walked, pushing it beside him. She had not seen
him. Suddenly she dropped the hose, glanced back at the house to
make sure no one was observing her, and darted forward. She cleared
the mason's cord and ran over those wet slabs&mdash;one, two, three
steps, then out into the weeds beside the road, almost in front of
Harry. She looked up at him and laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't tell on me, please!" With that she scampered up the dusty
road and into the Gayheart yard by the driveway.</p>

<p>After all these years the three footprints were still there in
the sidewalk; the straight, slender foot of a girl of thirteen,
delicately and clearly stamped in the grey-white composition. The
travel of the years had not made them fainter. To be sure, there
was never a great deal of walking out this way; people came out
here only when they were going to see the Gayhearts. Gordon had
never heard anyone speak of these footprints; perhaps no one knew
who made them. They were light, in very low relief; unless one were
looking for them, one might not notice them at all. The Gayheart
lots had not been well kept for a long while. In summer the wild
sunflowers grew up on either side of the walk and hung over it;
tufts of alfalfa, escaped from the near-by pasture, encroached upon
it, and a wild vetch with sprays of lavender-pink blossoms, like
fingers, came up there every year and climbed the sunflower stalks,
making a kind of wattle all along the two slabs marked by those
swift impressions. For to Harry Gordon they did seem swift: the
print of the toes was deeper than the heel; the heel was very
faint, as if that part of the living foot had just grazed the
surface of the pavement. Was there really some baffling suggestion
of quick motion in those impressions, Gordon often wondered, or was
it merely because he had seen them made, that to him they always
had a look of swiftness, mischief, and lightness? As if the feet
had tiny wings on them, like the herald Mercury.</p>

<p>Nothing else seemed to bring her back so vividly into the living
world for a moment. Sometimes, when he paused there, he caught for
a flash the very feel of her: an urge at his elbow, a breath on his
cheek, a sudden lightness and freshness like a shower of spring
raindrops.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Gordon and Milton Chase went over the Gayheart place thoroughly
that Sunday afternoon, walked through the garden and the orchard,
and the pasture beyond. The property now belonged to Gordon,
mortgaged to him as surety for the loans the bank had made Mr.
Gayheart during the last years of his life. If sold today, it would
not bring a third of the amount the bank had advanced on it. Both
men knew that. Gordon's plan was that Milton Chase should take the
place over, and occupy the house rent-free, for life.</p>

<p>After they had tramped about through the dry weeds and dead
grass, discussing what should be done with the orchard ground, and
how the old barn could be made into a garage, they sat down on the
porch steps and lit cigars.</p>

<p>"It's very generous of you, Harry," Milton Chase was saying,
"but I'd much prefer that you sold it to me. I've lived in a rented
house all my life, and now I'd like to own my own home," he ended
plaintively.</p>

<p>"I'll call in Whitney tomorrow, Milton, and have him draw me a
new will, leaving the place to you at my death, with no
encumbrance. That will beat paying out good money."</p>

<p>Milton took off his hat and smoothed the thin hair about his
ears with his hand. He didn't seem satisfied. He looked cold and
tired and mournful.</p>

<p>Harry thought a moment and then said persuasively: "You see,
Milton, if you bought the place and should die before me, your sons
might sell it to&mdash;well, to anybody; to one of these retired
farmers, who would make it into a chicken-yard. I'll never
interfere with you; cut down the orchard, pull down the barn, do
what you like. All I want is to retain a guardianship interest
during my lifetime."</p>

<p>Milton still looked dejected, but Harry took it for granted that
he had agreed to his proposition. "By the way, come over here with
me a minute. There is just one thing I want you to see to." They
walked across the lawn to the cement sidewalk. There Harry stopped.
"This is a confidential matter, you understand, you'll not mention
it. Those marks there in the cement were made by Gayheart's
daughter Lucy, when she was a little girl. I'll just ask you to see
that nothing happens to those two slabs of walk&mdash;in my time,
at least." Gordon raised his voice a trifle and went on in a
calculating tone, as if he were talking about alterations in a
garage. "The cement seems firm enough. The only thing I can see
that might injure it would be a wash-out. Heavy rains might carry
the earth out from under one side, or a corner, and the blocks
might tip and break. Keep an eye on them."</p>

<p>"I'll attend to it," Milton replied, just as he did to
instructions given him at the bank.</p>

<p>Harry said he guessed he must go into the house now, to clear
out the old man's private papers; he would see Milton at the bank
in the morning. Milton walked slowly home. When he got there, he
took a drink&mdash;a thing he seldom did. But he was cold; a little
chilled and uncomfortable in his mind, too. He was unpleasantly
reminded that there was, and always had been, something not quite
regular about his chief; something fantastic, which he was secretly
afraid of. That moment of conversation by the sidewalk had been
very depressing, though he could not say just why. It had made him
feel older; made life seem terribly short and not very&mdash;not
very important.</p>

<p>Harry, with some amusement, watched his cashier's mournful back
go down the street. He took a key out of his pocket and went into
the silent, darkened house. He ran up the blinds in the living-room
and let the four-o'clock afternoon sunlight pour in over the faded
carpets and dusty furniture. Then he went upstairs. Mr. Gayheart
had once mentioned (indeed the whole town knew it) that Pauline had
always kept Lucy's room just as she left it when she went off to
skate that day. After Pauline's death the old man kept the room
locked, and let his housekeeper go in to sweep and dust only when
he himself was standing by.</p>

<p>Gordon had all the keys. He took off his hat and opened the
locked room. The shades were down, but they did not fit very well,
and at the south window streaks of orange sunlight made a glow like
candlelight in the dusky chamber. The closet door was kept open
(prevention against moths), and dresses and dressing-gowns were
hanging in a row. They had better be burned, he supposed. Beside
her desk was a bookcase full of books and bound music scores; a
chest in his private study at the bank would be the best place for
those. He might look at them some time. Her toilet things were laid
out on the dresser, and leaning against the mirror, in a tarnished
silver frame, was a photograph of Clement Sebastian, with some
writing on it, in German. This Gordon put in his pocket. It was the
only thing he touched. He closed the door softly behind him, and
locked it.</p>

<p>When he came out of the house the last intense light of the
winter day was pouring over the town below him, and the bushy
tree-tops and the church steeples gleamed like copper. After all,
he was thinking, he would never go away from Haverford; he had been
through too much here ever to quit the place for good. What was a
man's "home town," anyway, but the place where he had had
disappointments and had learned to bear them? As he was leaving the
Gayhearts', he paused mechanically on the sidewalk, as he had done
so many thousand times, to look at the three light footprints,
running away.</p>
