  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">I. &mdash; MORNING AT THE CROSSROADS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Pacific is the loneliest of oceans, and travelers across
  that rolling desert begin to feel that their ship is lost in an eternity of
  sky and water. But if they are journeying from the atolls of the South Seas
  to the California coast, they come quite suddenly upon a half-way house. So
  those aboard the Oceanic had come upon it shortly after dawn this silent July
  morning. Brown misty peaks rose from the ocean floor, incredible, unreal. But
  they grew more probable with each moment of approach, until finally the
  watchers at the rail were thrilled to distinguish the bright green island of
  Oahu, streaked with darker folds where lurk the valley rains.</p>

  <p>The Oceanic swung about to the channel entrance. There stood Diamond Head,
  like a great lion&mdash;if you want the time-worn simile&mdash;crouched to
  spring. A crouching lion, yes; the figure is plausible up to that point; but
  as for springing&mdash;well, there has never been the slightest chance of
  that. Diamond Head is a kamaaina of the islands, and has long ago sensed the
  futility of acting on impulse&mdash;of acting, as a matter of fact, at
  all.</p>

  <p>A woman traveler stood by the starboard rail on the boat deck, gazing at
  the curved beach of Waikiki and, up ahead, the white walls of Honolulu half
  hidden in the foliage behind the Aloha Tower. A handsome woman in her early
  thirties, she had been a source of unending interest to her fellow passengers
  throughout that hot monotonous voyage from Tahiti. No matter in what remote
  corner of the world you have been hiding, you would have recognized her at
  once, for she was Shelah Fane of the pictures, and hers was a fame equal to
  that of any president or king.</p>

  <p>"A great piece of property," film salesmen had called her for eight years
  or more, but now they had begun to shake their heads. "Not so good. She's
  slipping." Golden lads and lasses must, like chimney-sweepers, come to dust,
  which is something the film stars think about when they can not sleep of
  nights. Shelah had not been sleeping well of late, and her eyes, as they
  rested on peaceful Tantalus with its halo of fleecy cloud, were sad and a
  little wistful.</p>

  <p>She heard a familiar step on the deck behind her and turned. A broad,
  powerful, keen-looking man was smiling down at her.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;Alan," she said. "How are you this morning?"</p>

  <p>"A bit anxious," he replied. He joined her at the rail. His was a face
  that had never known Klieg lights and makeup; it was deeply lined and bronzed
  by tropic suns. "Journey's end, Shelah&mdash;for you at least," he added,
  laying his hand over hers. "Are you sorry?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated a moment. "Rather sorry&mdash;yes. I shouldn't have cared if
  we had just sailed on and on."</p>

  <p>"Nor I." He stared at Honolulu with the bright look of interest that comes
  naturally to British eyes at sight of a new port, a new anchorage. The ship
  had come to a stop at the channel entrance, and a launch bearing the customs
  men and the doctor was speeding toward it.</p>

  <p>"You haven't forgotten?" The Britisher turned back to Shelah Fane. "This
  isn't journey's end for me. You know I'm leaving you behind here to-night.
  Sailing out at midnight on this same ship&mdash;and I must have your answer
  before I go."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "You shall have it before you go. I promise."</p>

  <p>For a brief moment he studied her face. A marked change had crept over her
  at the sight of land. She had come back from the little world of the ship to
  the great world whose adoration she expected and thrived on. No longer calm,
  languorous, at peace, her eyes were alight with a restless flame, her small
  foot tapped nervously on the deck. A sudden fear overwhelmed him, a fear that
  the woman he had known and worshipped these past few weeks was slipping from
  him for ever.</p>

  <p>"Why must you wait?" he cried. "Give me your answer now."</p>

  <p>"No, no," she protested. "Not now. Later to-day." She glanced over her
  shoulder. "Were there reporters on the launch, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>A tall, handsome, hatless youth with a mop of blond hair waving in the
  breeze rushed up to her. His energy was a challenge to the climate.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Miss Fane. Remember me? Met you when you went through here on your
  way south. Jim Bradshaw, of the Tourist Bureau, press-agent of beauty,
  contact man for Paradise. Our best aloha&mdash;and here's a lei to prove it."
  He hung a fragrant garland about her neck, while the man she had called Alan
  moved quietly away.</p>

  <p>"You're awfully kind," Shelah Fane told him. "Of course I remember you.
  You seemed so glad to see me. You do now."</p>

  <p>He grinned. "I am&mdash;and besides, that's my job. I'm the door-mat on
  the threshold of Hawaii, with 'welcome' written all over me. Island
  hospitality&mdash;I have to make sure that my advertisements all came true.
  But in your case, I&mdash;well, believe me, it isn't any strain." He saw that
  she looked expectantly beyond him. "Say, I'm sorry, but all the newspaper men
  seem to be lingering in the arms of Morpheus. However, you can't blame them.
  Lulled as they are by the whisper of the soft invigorating trade-winds in the
  coco-palms&mdash;I'll finish that later. Just tell me what's doing, and I'll
  see that it gets into the papers. Did you complete the big South Sea picture
  down in Tahiti?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite," she answered. "We left a few sequences to be shot in
  Honolulu. We can live here so much more comfortably, and the backgrounds, you
  know, are every bit as beautiful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do I know it?" the boy cried. "Ask me. Exotic flowers, blossoming trees,
  verdant green hills, blue sunny skies with billowy white clouds&mdash;the
  whole a dream of the unchanging tropics with the feel of spring. How's that?
  I wrote it yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Sounds pretty good to me," Shelah laughed.</p>

  <p>"You'll be some time in Honolulu, Miss Fane?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I've sent for my servants," she told him. "They've taken a
  house for me on the beach. I stifle in hotels&mdash;and then, too, people are
  always staring at me. I hope it's a large house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is," Bradshaw cut in. "I was out there yesterday. They're all set and
  waiting for you. I saw your butler&mdash;and your secretary, Julie O'Neill.
  Speaking of that, some day I'd like to ask you where you find secretaries
  like her."</p>

  <p>Shelah smiled. "Oh, Julie's much more than a secretary. Sort of a
  daughter&mdash;almost. Though of course that's absurd to say, for we're
  nearly the same age."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said the boy&mdash;to himself.</p>

  <p>"Julie's mother was a dear friend of mine, and when she died four years
  ago, I took the child in. One must do a good deed occasionally," she added,
  modestly looking down at the deck.</p>

  <p>"Sure," agreed Bradshaw. "If we don't we's never be tapped for the Boy
  Scouts. Julie was telling me how kind you've been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've been amply repaid," the star assured him. "Julie is a darling."</p>

  <p>"Isn't she?" replied the boy heartily. "If I had my rhyming dictionary
  along, I'd give you a good description of the girl right here and now."</p>

  <p>Shelah Fane looked at him suddenly. "But Julie got in only two days
  ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and so did I. Made a flying trip to Los Angeles, and came back
  on the same boat with her. The best crossing I ever had. You
  know&mdash;moonlight, silver seas, a pretty girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I must look into this," said Shelah Fane.</p>

  <p>Two of the passengers joined them: a weary, disillusioned-looking man
  whose costume suggested Hollywood Boulevard, and a dashing girl of twenty.
  Shelah yielded to the inevitable. "Mr. Bradshaw, of the Tourist Bureau," she
  explained. "This is Miss Diana Dixon, who is in my new picture, and Huntley
  Van Horn, my leading man."</p>

  <p>Miss Dixon lost no time. She sparkled instantly. "Honolulu is an adorable
  place. I'm always so thrilled to come here&mdash;such beauty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," cut in the star. "Mr. Bradshaw knows all that. None
  better."</p>

  <p>"Always happy to have my ideas confirmed," bowed the boy. "Especially from
  such a charming source." He turned to the man. "Mr. Van Horn&mdash;I've seen
  you in the films."</p>

  <p>Van Horn smiled cynically. "So, I believe, have the natives of Borneo. Has
  Shelah told you anything about our latest epic?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," Bradshaw replied. "Got a good part?"</p>

  <p>"It always has been a good part," Van Horn said. "I trust my rendering of
  the role will not impair its future usefulness. If it does, many of our
  leading studios will have to close. I'm a beach-comber, you see, and I've
  sunk lower and lower&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You would," nodded the star.</p>

  <p>"I'm wallowing in the depths, and quite comfortable, thank you," went on
  Van Horn, "when&mdash;if you can believe it&mdash;I'm saved. Absolutely
  rehabilitated, you know, through the love of this primitive, brown-skinned
  child."</p>

  <p>"Which child?" asked Bradshaw blankly. "Oh, you mean Miss Fane. Well, it
  sounds like a great plot&mdash;but don't tell me, don't tell me." He turned
  to the star. "I'm glad you're going to take a few shots in Honolulu. That
  sort of thing makes us very happy at the Tourist Bureau. I must run
  along&mdash;one or two other celebrities on the ship. Fellow named Alan
  Jaynes&mdash;very wealthy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was talking with him when you came up," Shelah said.</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I'll go after him. Diamond mines&mdash;South Africa&mdash;he
  sounds good. We're strong for the arts in Hawaii, you know, but as for
  money&mdash;well, when that appears in the harbor, then we really get out the
  flags. See you all later."</p>

  <p>He disappeared down the deck, and the three picture people moved over to
  the rail.</p>

  <p>"Here comes Val," said Huntley Van Horn, "looking like the man who wrote
  the tropics."</p>

  <p>He referred to Val Martino, director of Shelah's latest picture, who was
  rapidly approaching along the deck. He was a short, stocky, gray-haired man,
  dressed in a suit of immaculate white silk. Above a flaming red tie loomed
  his broad heavy face. It was almost the same shade as the tie, suggesting
  that Mr. Martino had never concerned himself with such trivial matters as
  blood pressure and diet.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he said. "Well, here we are. Thank heaven, Tahiti has been
  attended to. From this on, I'll take my tropics after they've been ruined by
  American plumbing. Was that a newspaper man you were talking with,
  Shelah?"</p>

  <p>"Not precisely. A boy from the Tourist Bureau."</p>

  <p>"I hope you laid it on thick about the new picture," he continued. "You
  know, we'll need all the publicity we can get."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's forget the picture," returned the star a bit wearily.</p>

  <p>The Oceanic was drawing slowly up to the pier, on which a surprisingly
  meager crowd was waiting. Shelah Fane gazed at the group with interest and
  some disappointment. She had rather hoped for a vast throng of schoolgirls in
  white, bearing triumphal leis. But this had happened when she went through
  before; she could not expect history to repeat itself&mdash;and it was, too,
  only seven in the morning.</p>

  <p>"There's Julie," she cried suddenly. "There&mdash;near the end of the
  pier. See&mdash;she's waving." She returned Julie's signal.</p>

  <p>"Who's that beside her?" Van Horn inquired. "Good lord&mdash;it looks like
  Tarneverro."</p>

  <p>"It is Tarneverro," Miss Dixon said.</p>

  <p>"What's he doing here?" the leading man wondered.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he's here because I sent for him," said Shelah Fane.</p>

  <p>A quiet black-garbed maid stood at her side. "What is it, Anna?"</p>

  <p>"The customs men, madam. They're going through everything. You'd better
  come. They want talking to, it seems."</p>

  <p>"I'll talk to them," said the star firmly, and followed the maid into her
  suite.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you know about that?" Van Horn remarked. "She's sent for
  that phony fortune-teller to come all the way from Hollywood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, phony?" cut in Miss Dixon. "Tarneverro is simply
  wonderful. He's told me the most amazing things about my past&mdash;and about
  my future, too. I never take a step without consulting him&mdash;and neither
  does Shelah."</p>

  <p>Martino shook his great head impatiently. "It's a rotten scandal," he
  cried, "the way most of you Hollywood women have gone mad over voodoo men.
  Telling them all your secrets&mdash;some day one of them will publish his
  memoirs, and then where will you be? A few of us try to lift the industry to
  a dignified plane&mdash;but, oh, lord&mdash;what's the use?"</p>

  <p>"No use, my dear fellow," said Van Horn. He looked across the intervening
  stretch of water at the tall lean figure of the fortune-teller. "Poor
  Shelah&mdash;there's something rather touching in such faith as this. I
  presume she wants to ask Tarneverro whether or not she shall marry Alan
  Jaynes."</p>

  <p>"Of course she does," Miss Dixon nodded. "She wants to know if she'll be
  happy with him. She cabled Tarneverro the day after Jaynes proposed. Why not?
  Marriage is a serious step."</p>

  <p>Martino shrugged. "If she'd only ask me, I'd read her future quick enough.
  She's nearly through in pictures, and she ought to know it. Her contract
  expires in six months, and I happen to know&mdash;in strict confidence, you
  understand&mdash;it won't be renewed. I can see her taking a long journey by
  water then&mdash;going abroad to make a picture&mdash;the beginning of the
  end. She'd better grab this diamond king quick before he changes his mind.
  But no&mdash;she's fooling round with a back-parlor crystal-gazer. However,
  that's like you people. You won't grow up." He walked away.</p>

  <p>The formalities of the port were quickly ended, and the Oceanic docked.
  Shelah Fane was the first down the plank, to be received by the eager arms of
  her secretary. Julie was young, impetuous, unspoiled; her joy was
  genuine.</p>

  <p>"The house is all ready, Shelah. It's a knockout. Jessop is there, and
  we've found a Chinese cook who's a magician. The car's waiting."</p>

  <p>"Really, dear?"</p>

  <p>The star looked up into the dark deep-set eyes of the man at Julie's side.
  "Tarneverro&mdash;what a relief to see you here. But I knew I could depend on
  you."</p>

  <p>"Always," said the fortune-teller gravely.</p>

  <p>What the crowd lacked in numbers, it made up in noise and confusion. Anna,
  the maid, was overwhelmed with boxes and bags, and seeing this, Tarneverro
  went to help her. There was no condescension in his manner; he treated her
  with the same courtly grace he would have shown the star.</p>

  <p>Alan Jaynes and Bradshaw appeared on the scene. The latter went over to
  greet Julie with as much warmth as though he had just arrived after a long
  hard voyage from some distant port. Jaynes stepped quickly to Shelah's
  side.</p>

  <p>"I shall be damnably anxious," he said. "This afternoon&mdash;may I come
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she nodded. "Oh&mdash;this is Julie&mdash;you've heard about
  her. Julie, please tell him the number of our house. We're just beyond the
  Grand Hotel, on Kalakaua Avenue."</p>

  <p>Julie told him, and he turned back to Shelah. "I shan't keep you&mdash;"
  he began.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," said the star. "I want to introduce an old friend from
  Hollywood. Tarneverro&mdash;will you come here, please?"</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller handed a couple of bags to Shelah's chauffeur, and came
  at once. Jaynes looked at him with some surprise.</p>

  <p>"Tarneverro&mdash;I want you to meet Alan Jaynes," the star said.</p>

  <p>They shook hands. "Glad to know you," remarked the Britisher. As he gazed
  into the other man's face, he experienced a sudden sensation of deep dislike.
  Here was power; not the power of muscle, which he had himself and could
  understand; but something more subtle, something uncanny, inexplicable and
  oddly disturbing. "Sorry, but I must dash along now," he added.</p>

  <p>He disappeared into the crowd, and Julie led them to the waiting car.
  Tarneverro, it appeared, was stopping at the Grand, and Shelah offered to
  drop him there.</p>

  <p>Presently they were bowling along through Honolulu's streets, under a
  flaming blue sky. The town was waking to another leisurely day. Men of many
  races languidly bestirred themselves; at the corner of King Street a boy
  offered the morning paper, and a fat brown-skinned policeman lazily turned a
  stop-go sign to let them pass. Shelah Fane, like all passengers newly
  descended from a ship at this port, felt rather dazzled by the brightness and
  the color.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall enjoy this," she cried. "I've never stayed here longer than
  one day before. What a relief to be out of the South Seas."</p>

  <p>"But they're romantic, aren't they?" Julie asked.</p>

  <p>"The illusions of youth," the star shrugged. "I shan't destroy them. Only
  don't mention Tahiti to me again as long as I live."</p>

  <p>"Not quite like the books," Tarneverro nodded. He sat, mysterious even in
  that bright world, at Shelah's side. "I discovered that for myself, long ago.
  You're staying here for some time, I take it?"</p>

  <p>"A month, I hope," the star answered. "A couple of weeks still to go on
  the picture, and then, I trust, a fortnight's rest. I want it badly,
  Tarneverro. I'm tired&mdash;tired."</p>

  <p>"You need not tell me that," he said. "I have eyes."</p>

  <p>He had, indeed, eyes; eyes that were cold and piercing and rather
  disquieting. The car sped on past the old royal palace and the judiciary
  building, and turned off into Kalakaua Avenue.</p>

  <p>"It was so good of you to come over here," Shelah told him.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he replied evenly. "I started the day after I got your
  cable. I was due for a vacation&mdash;my work, you know, is not precisely
  restful. Then, too, you said you needed me. That was enough. That will always
  be&mdash;enough."</p>

  <p>Julie began to chatter about the islands: she mentioned the warm caressing
  waters of Waikiki, the thrill of haunting native music in the purple night,
  the foreign pageant of the streets.</p>

  <p>"All of which," smiled Shelah, "sounds very much to me like James Bradshaw
  in one of his more lyric moods."</p>

  <p>Julie laughed. "Yes, I guess I was quoting Jimmy. Did you meet him,
  Shelah?"</p>

  <p>"I met him," the star nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's really very nice," Julie assured her. "Especially when he isn't
  talking shop."</p>

  <p>The pink walls of the Grand Hotel appeared at that moment through a
  network of majestic palms, and Shelah directed the chauffeur to turn in at
  the gates.</p>

  <p>"I must talk with you very soon," she said to Tarneverro. "I have so much
  to ask you. You see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He raised a slim white hand. "Don't tell me, please," he smiled. "Let me
  tell you."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him, a little startled. "Oh&mdash;of course. I need your
  advice, Tarneverro. You must help me again, as you have helped me so often in
  the past."</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely. "I shall try. With what success&mdash;who knows? Come
  to my apartment at eleven o'clock&mdash;it is number nineteen, on the first
  floor. There is a short flight of stairs leading to my corridor just at the
  left of the hotel desk as you enter. I shall expect you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes." Her voice was trembling. "I must settle this thing to-day.
  I'll be there."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro bowed from the hotel steps, and as the car drove off Shelah was
  conscious of Julie's frank young eyes fixed on her with a disapproval that
  was almost contempt.</p>

  <p>The head bell-man touched Tarneverro's sleeve. "Excuse. There is a man who
  waits to see you. This one."</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller turned to perceive a bulky Chinese who approached him
  with an amazingly light step. The ivory face was wearing a somewhat stupid
  expression; the black eyes were veiled and sleepy-looking. Not a very
  intelligent Chinese, Tarneverro thought, wondering vaguely what this visit
  presaged.</p>

  <p>The oriental placed one hand on his broad chest, and achieved a grand bow
  despite his waist-line.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pardons," he remarked. "Have I the undisputable honor to
  address Tarneverro the Great?"</p>

  <p>"I am Tarneverro," answered the other bruskly. "What can I do for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Permit that I introduce myself," continued the Chinese, "unworthy of your
  notice though I am. The name is Harry Wing, and I am humble business man of
  this island. Do I extend my remarks too far when I say I wish to see you
  alone?"</p>

  <p>Tarneverro shrugged. "What for?"</p>

  <p>"The matter is of pressing urgency. If I might suggest&mdash;your
  room&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller gazed for a moment into that placid mask of a face,
  behind which life seemed nonexistent. He capitulated. "Come along," he said.
  Obtaining his key at the desk, he led the way.</p>

  <p>Once inside the door of number nineteen, he turned to confront his odd
  visitor, who had followed on noiseless feet. The curtains of the sitting-room
  were drawn back as far as they would go, and the place was flooded with
  light. With his customary forethought, Tarneverro had selected an apartment
  on the mountain side of the hotel, and a restless cool wind from the Koolau
  Range swept in at the window and stirred the papers lying on a desk.</p>

  <p>The countenance of the Chinese was still without expression, even under
  the piercing scrutiny the fortune-teller now gave it.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Tarneverro.</p>

  <p>"You are the famous Tarneverro," began Harry Wing in a respectful
  singsong. "Among Hollywood people you have vast reputation as one who lifts
  dark veils and peers into uncertain future. Black as lacquer that future may
  be to ordinary eyes, but to yours, they say, it is clear as glass. Permit me
  to add this reputation pursues you even to Hawaii, dogging like shadow at
  your heels. The rumor of your mystic skill floods the street."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" put in Tarneverro shortly. "What of it?"</p>

  <p>"I am, as I say, business man of small importance to everybody but myself.
  Now I begin to speak to you frankly that opportunity arouses itself in my
  path. I can amalgamate my business up together with that of my cousin from a
  north province. Future looks bright, but qualms assail me. Will the merge
  have success? Is my cousin honorable as cousin of mine should naturally be?
  Can I trust him? In fewer words, I desire dark veil lifted, and you are man
  to do the business. I stand ready to make generous payment for this
  lifting."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro's eyes narrowed, and for a long time he stood staring at this
  unexpected customer for his wares. The Chinese waited motionless as a Buddha,
  with his hands in his trousers pockets, his coat thrown back. The
  fortune-teller's glance rested for a moment at a point just below the
  fountain-pen pocket on his visitor's waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"Impossible," he said, with sudden decision. "I am here on a vacation, not
  to practice my profession."</p>

  <p>"But rumor remarks," objected the other, "that you have already done work
  with crystal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For one or two of the hotel managers&mdash;as a friendly gesture,"
  Tarneverro cut in. "I received no fee of any sort. I will not do this kind of
  thing for the general public."</p>

  <p>Harry Wing shrugged. "The matter then becomes sad disappointment for me,"
  he answered.</p>

  <p>A grim smile spread over the seer's dark face. "Sit down," he said. "I
  have spent some time in China, and I understand how great is the interest of
  your people in fortune-tellers. So for a moment, while you were telling me
  why you came, I thought you were speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>The visitor frowned. "I am now rapidly failing to understand you."</p>

  <p>Still smiling, Tarneverro dropped into a chair facing the oriental. "Yes,
  Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;Wing, I believe you said&mdash;momentarily I was
  deceived. And then a certain little gift of mine came to my aid. You have
  been kind enough to speak of my success. I have succeeded&mdash;why? Because
  I happen to be psychic, Mr. Wing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Chinese people are psychic, too."</p>

  <p>"Just a moment. As I stood there listening to you, a psychic wave swept
  over me. I had a feeling&mdash;a feeling of&mdash;what? Of stern men who sit
  in police stations and are sworn to enforce the laws. Of detectives pursuing
  evildoers, landing them at last&mdash;and then, a court of justice,
  so-called, a learned judge. That, my friend, is the feeling I had. Rather
  amazing, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>His visitor's expression had lost suddenly all its stupidity. The little
  black eyes snapped with admiration.</p>

  <p>"Amazing smart act on your part, yes. But as for me, I do not think it was
  psychic feeling. A moment ago I beheld your eyes resting with fierce
  understanding on locality of my own waistcoat from which detective badge was
  recently removed. The pin has left indelible marks. You are number one
  detective yourself, and I congratulate you."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro threw back his head and laughed. "Touche!" he cried. "So you
  are a detective, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The name is Chan," said the bulky Chinese, grinning broadly. "Inspector
  Chan, of the Honolulu police&mdash;former times Sergeant, but there has been
  upheaval in local police department, and I am rewarded far beyond my humble
  merits. Trap which has just failed so flatly, I add in justice to me
  personally, was not my idea. I informed Chief it would not work unless you
  happened to be extreme dull-wit. Since you turn out clever beyond
  expectation, it did not. No bitter feelings. I pause only to call attention
  to local ordinance which says men like you must not practice dark arts in
  this town without obtaining permission. A word being spoken to the wise, I
  rise to accomplish my exit."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro also stood up. "I am not going to practice among your
  townspeople," he announced. He had dropped the tense air of mystery which he
  evoked for the benefit of film stars, and seemed quite human and not
  unlikable. "It has been a pleasure to meet you, Inspector. As for my own
  detective prowess, I may say in confidence that it is rather useful in my
  work."</p>

  <p>"Must be so," returned Chan. "But such skill as yours should be at service
  of public. Frequently in Los Angeles murder mystery leaps into print and
  never gets solved. I study them all with fiery interest. The Taylor
  case&mdash;what an amazing happening was there&mdash;haie, it is still
  mystery. And case of Denny Mayo, famous actor of handsome countenance, dead
  in his home at night. How many years&mdash;three and more&mdash;and Denny
  Mayo is still unavenged by Los Angeles police."</p>

  <p>"And never will be," added the fortune-teller. "No, Inspector, that is not
  in my line. I find it safer to dwell on the future and soft-pedal Hollywood's
  past."</p>

  <p>"In such course, wisdom may abide," agreed Chan. "None the less, how
  happily I would welcome your aid if some such worrisome puzzle stared into my
  face. I will say good-by, Mr. Tarneverro. Memory of your cleverness will
  linger in my poor mind for long time to come."</p>

  <p>He slipped quietly out, and Tarneverro glanced at his watch. With a
  leisurely air, he placed a small table in the middle of the room, and taking
  from a bureau drawer a gleaming crystal, stood it thereon. Then he stepped to
  the window and drew the curtains part way across, shutting out a goodly
  portion of the bright light outside. Glancing about the darkened room, he
  shrugged his shoulders. Not such an impressive stage-setting as his studio in
  Los Angeles, but it would have to serve. Sitting down by the window, he took
  out of his pocket a bulky letter and, slitting the flap of the envelope,
  began to read. The curtains, caught in the fierce grip of the trade-wind,
  swirled about his head.</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock Shelah Fane knocked on the door, and he ushered her into
  his sitting-room. She was gowned in white and appeared younger than she had
  at the dock, but her eyes were clouded with worry. Tarneverro's manner was
  professional now, he was cold, remote, unsympathetic. He seated her at the
  table behind the crystal; then, drawing the curtains all the way, plunged the
  room into almost complete darkness.</p>

  <p>"Tarneverro&mdash;you must tell me what to do," she began. He sat down
  opposite her.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he commanded. He looked fixedly into the crystal. "I see you
  standing at the rail on the boat deck of a steamer, under a brilliant moon.
  You are wearing a dinner gown&mdash;it is gold and matches your hair. There
  is a scarf of the same color about your shoulders. A man is standing at your
  side; he points, and offers you a pair of glasses. You raise them to your
  eyes&mdash;you catch the last faint glimmer of the lights along the front at
  Papeete, the port from which you sailed a few brief hours ago."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," murmured Shelah Fane. "Oh, Tarneverro&mdash;how do you
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The man turns. I can see him only dimly, but I recognize him. To-day, on
  the pier&mdash;Alan Jaynes&mdash;was that his name? He has asked you a
  question&mdash;marriage, perhaps&mdash;but you shake your head. Reluctantly.
  You want to say yes&mdash;yet you don't. You put him off. Why? I feel you
  love this man."</p>

  <p>"I do," the star cried. "Oh, Tarneverro&mdash;I really do. I knew him
  first at Papeete&mdash;only a week&mdash;but in a place like that&mdash;The
  first night out&mdash;it was just as you say&mdash;he proposed to me. I
  haven't given him my answer yet. I want to say yes&mdash;to have a little
  happiness now&mdash;I've earned it, I think. But I&mdash;I'm
  afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He lifted, his piercing eyes from the crystal. "You're afraid. Something
  in your past&mdash;you fear it will return to haunt you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no," the woman cried.</p>

  <p>"Something that happened long ago."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;it isn't true."</p>

  <p>"You can not deceive me. How long ago? I can not quite determine, and it
  is necessary that I know."</p>

  <p>The trade-wind mumbled at the curtains. Shelah Fane's eyes wandered
  helplessly about the darkened room, then came back to Tarneverro's.</p>

  <p>"How long ago?" the man demanded again.</p>

  <p>She sighed. "Three years ago last month," she said in a voice so low he
  had to strain to hear.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment, his mind racing like an engine.
  June&mdash;three years ago. He gazed fixedly into the crystal; his lips
  moved. "Denny Mayo," he said softly. "Something about Denny Mayo. Ah,
  yes&mdash;I see it now."</p>

  <p>The wind tore the curtains apart, and a wide strip of dazzling light fell
  across Shelah Fane's face. Her eyes were staring, frightened.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have come," she moaned.</p>

  <p>"What about Denny Mayo?" Tarneverro went on relentlessly. "Shall I tell
  you&mdash;or will you tell me?"</p>

  <p>She pointed to the window. "A balcony. There's a balcony out there."</p>

  <p>As one who humors a child, he rose and looked outside. He came back to the
  table. "Yes, there's a balcony&mdash;but no one is on it."</p>

  <p>He sat down again, and his bold commanding eyes sought hers. She was
  trapped, and helpless.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Tarneverro the Great.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">II. &mdash; THE HOUSE ON THE BEACH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After a brief twilight, the dark sweeps over Waikiki Beach
  like old Man Mystery himself. In the hours before the moon, like a climbing
  torch, ascends the purple sky, the sense of hearing comes into its own.
  Blackness covers the coco-palms, yet they may be heard rustling at the
  trade-wind's touch; the white line of the breakers is blotted out, yet they
  continue to crash on that unseen shore with what seems an added vigor. This
  is night in the real sense of the word, intriguing, awe-inspiring, but all
  too short, for the moon is waiting an early cue.</p>

  <p>A solitary floor lamp was burning in the huge living-room of the house
  Shelah Fane had rented at Waikiki. The paneled walls, the furniture and the
  floor, all fashioned of rare native woods, gleamed faintly in the half-light;
  the green of exotic plants was everywhere. The French windows that faced the
  street were closed, but those on the ocean side, leading on to a great
  screened lanai, stood wide, and through them at regular intervals came the
  roar of the surf, which was running high.</p>

  <p>Shelah Fane came into the room. She walked with a quick nervous step, and
  in her eyes was a look of apprehension&mdash;almost of terror. It was a look
  that had been there ever since her return from that interview with Tarneverro
  in his apartment at the Grand Hotel. What had she done? She asked this of
  herself over and over. What had she done? What was the secret of this dark
  man's power that he had so easily dragged from the inner recesses of her mind
  a story she had thought safely buried for ever? Once away from the strange
  influence of his presence she had been appalled at her own indiscretion. But
  it was too late then for anything save regret.</p>

  <p>With her unerring instinct for the spotlight, she sat down under the
  single lamp. Many cameras had clicked in Hollywood since that distant time
  when, like a rocket, she had flashed into the picture sky, and nowadays the
  spotlight was none too kind to her. Kind to her hair, yes, which seemed to
  spring into flame, but not so considerate of the lines of worry about her
  eyes, about her small tense mouth. Did she know? Longer than most rockets she
  had hung blazing in the sky; now she must endure the swift lonely drop in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>Her butler, Jessop, came in, a spare elderly Englishman who had also found
  in Hollywood the promised land. He carried a florist's box. Shelah looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jessop," she said. "Did Miss Julie tell you? The dinner hour is
  eight-thirty."</p>

  <p>"I understand, madam," he answered gravely.</p>

  <p>"A few of the young people are going for a dip before we dine. Mr.
  Bradshaw for one. You might show him to the blue bedroom to dress. The
  bath-houses are dark and need cleaning. Miss Julie and Miss Diana will dress
  in their rooms."</p>

  <p>Jessop nodded, as Julie came in. The girl wore an afternoon gown, and her
  face was innocent of make-up. She was enthusiastic, happy, young&mdash;a
  touch of envy darkened the star's fine eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry, Shelah," Julie said. "Jessop and I have planned
  everything. It will be like all your parties&mdash;a knockout. What's that,
  Jessop? Flowers?"</p>

  <p>"For Miss Fane," explained the butler, and handing the box to the girl,
  left the room.</p>

  <p>Shelah Fane was looking about her, a frown on her face. "I've been
  wondering, Julie. How in the world can I arrange a good entrance on the
  party, in a place like this? If only there were a balcony, or at least a
  broad flight of stairs."</p>

  <p>Julie laughed. "You might come suddenly through the lanai, strumming a
  ukulele and singing a Hawaiian song."</p>

  <p>The star took her seriously. "No good, my dear. I'd be entering on the
  same level with the guests, and that is never effective. To make the proper
  impression, one must appear suddenly from above&mdash;always remember that,
  darling. Now, in Hollywood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged. "Oh, just come in naturally for once, Shelah. There's a
  lot in novelty, you know." She had torn the cord from the box of flowers, and
  now she lifted the lid. "Lovely," she cried. "Orchids, Shelah."</p>

  <p>The star turned, without interest. Orchids were nothing new in her life.
  "Nice of Alan," she said languidly.</p>

  <p>But Julie shook her head. "No," she announced, "they're not from Mr.
  Jaynes, evidently." She read the card aloud. "'With love from one you have
  forgotten.' Who could that be, Shelah?"</p>

  <p>"Who couldn't it be?" smiled the star a bit wistfully. She rose with
  sudden interest. "I wonder&mdash;let me see the card." She glanced at it.
  "'With love from one&mdash;'" Her eyes lighted with quick understanding.
  "Why, it's Bob's writing. Dear old Bob! Just fancy&mdash;with
  love&mdash;after all these years."</p>

  <p>"Bob?" inquired the girl.</p>

  <p>Shelah nodded. "Bob Fyfe&mdash;my first and only husband, dear. You never
  knew him&mdash;it was long ago. I was just a kid, in the chorus of a musical
  show in New York, and Bob was an actor, a legitimate actor&mdash;such a good
  one, too. I adored him then, but along came Hollywood, and our divorce. And
  now&mdash;with love&mdash;I wonder? Can it be true?"</p>

  <p>"What's he doing in Honolulu?" Julie asked.</p>

  <p>"Playing in stock," Shelah replied. "Leading man at some theater here.
  Rita Ballou told me all about him, this morning when I called her up." She
  took the orchids. "I shall wear these to-night," she announced. "I never
  dreamed he would even speak to me. I&mdash;I'm touched. I'd like to see Bob
  again." A thoughtful look crossed her face. "I'd like to see him at once. He
  was always so kind, so clever. What time is it&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;" She
  glanced at a watch on her wrist. "Seven-twenty. What was the name of that
  theater? Rita told me. The Royal, I think she said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door-bell rang briskly, there ensued a snappy bit of dialogue in the
  hall and Jimmy Bradshaw burst through the curtains. He was, it seemed, in a
  light-hearted mood.</p>

  <p>"Here we all are," he cried. "Everybody who really matters. Well, Miss
  Fane, how does it feel to be foot-loose and care-free on a palm-fringed
  shore&mdash;way down in the warm southern seas?"</p>

  <p>"It's really very restful," Shelah smiled. She nodded at Julie. "I'll be
  back in a moment. I want a pin for these flowers."</p>

  <p>She disappeared into the hall, and Bradshaw turned quickly to the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"You're looking great," he cried. "It's the climate. Not that you didn't
  look fairly good at the start&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she cut in. "What do you think of Shelah?"</p>

  <p>"Shelah?" He paused. "Oh, she's all right. Nice and friendly but&mdash;a
  bit artificial&mdash;a good actress, on and off. In the past two years I've
  met enough screen stars to start a Hollywood of my own, and what I always say
  is&mdash;doffing my hat to southern California&mdash;you can have 'em."</p>

  <p>"You don't really know Shelah," protested the girl.</p>

  <p>"No, I guess not. She's been kind to you, and that makes her aces up with
  me. But my own preference in women&mdash;and I've looked very carefully over
  the field&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have, have you?"</p>

  <p>"My ideal&mdash;since you've asked me, and I'm glad you have&mdash;is a
  rather different sort. Lovely, of course, young, innocent,
  ingenuous&mdash;and pretty crazy about yours truly. That&mdash;and you may
  quote me freely&mdash;is the girl for me."</p>

  <p>Diana came suddenly through the curtains. She, too, still wore an
  afternoon gown.</p>

  <p>"Hello, big boy," she said. "You ready for that swim with me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," replied Bradshaw. "With you&mdash;and anybody else who wants to
  come along." He looked at Julie. "Let's go. Before the moon rises is my idea.
  It's the best time. Any one else going&mdash;or is it just&mdash;the three of
  us?"</p>

  <p>Julie shook her head. "No one else, I guess. The others are afraid of
  spoiling their make-up."</p>

  <p>"Which is one advantage of youth over doddering age," the boy returned.
  "Well, come along&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Shelah appeared, wearing the orchids on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Just about to dip into the world-famed waters of Waikiki," Jimmy informed
  her. "Won't you join us?"</p>

  <p>"Some other evening," she told him. "You know, I'm hostess to-night."</p>

  <p>"You are missing," said Bradshaw impressively, "one of the thrills of a
  lifetime. The silken surf beating on coral sand, the dark, star-strewn sky
  above, perhaps the pastel loveliness of a lunar rainbow&mdash;boats run from
  Los Angeles and San Francisco once a week, and the fare is within the reach
  of all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door-bell rang again. Accompanied by Shelah, the young people went out
  into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Get your suit," Julie said to the boy. "I'll show you where to change.
  Let's make it a race. The first one into the water gets a prize."</p>

  <p>"I'll win it," answered Bradshaw. "I'll name it too." They clattered up
  the polished stairs.</p>

  <p>Again the bell sounded. Shelah was just beside the door, but she did not
  open it; she considered such an act beneath the dignity of a star. Instead
  she returned to the living-room and waited for Jessop to do his duty. After a
  brief delay, he did it, and two new guests appeared in the living-room.
  Shelah advanced to meet them&mdash;a dark, rather faded woman of thirty,
  followed by a big blond man who had an air of nonchalant authority.</p>

  <p>"Rita Ballou," the star cried. "Why&mdash;it's ages! And Wilkie&mdash;I'm
  so glad."</p>

  <p>"Hello, darling," said the woman she called Rita.</p>

  <p>The man came forward. "Look here, Shelah. What time did you say dinner was
  to be?"</p>

  <p>"Eight-thirty&mdash;but it doesn't matter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ballou turned to his wife. "Good lord&mdash;can't you ever get anything
  straight?"</p>

  <p>"What's the difference?" the woman replied. "We can have a chat with
  Shelah before the others come." She turned to the star. "So sorry we missed
  you when you went through before. We were on the mainland."</p>

  <p>"Haven't missed you this time, thank heaven," added Wilkie Ballou. "By
  gad, you're as blooming as ever."</p>

  <p>"How do you do it?" inquired Rita sweetly. Her cold eyes flashed green
  with envy as she looked at Shelah.</p>

  <p>"She's found the fountain of youth," suggested Wilkie admiringly.</p>

  <p>"I've always heard that was in Hawaii," smiled the star. She looked hard
  at Rita. "But it isn't," the look added.</p>

  <p>Rita understood. "Not at all," she said grimly. "It's in the beauty shops
  of Hollywood, and you know it. Over here, women fade quickly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," protested Shelah.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they do. Oh&mdash;I've learned my lesson&mdash;too late. I should
  have stayed in Hollywood and gone on with my career."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear,&mdash;surely you're happy with Wilkie?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. The way I would be with the toothache."</p>

  <p>Wilkie shrugged. "Overlook it, Shelah," he said. "We've been rowing all
  the way out here. Rita's nerves, you know."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" remarked his wife. "I guess any one would have nerves with a
  husband like you. Honestly, Shelah, he's got a better imagination than what's
  his name&mdash;Shakespeare. If he'd only drop sugar planting and go in for
  writing scenarios&mdash;but never mind us. Tell me all about Hollywood. I'd
  love to be back."</p>

  <p>"I'm making a long stop here&mdash;we'll have lots of time to chat later,"
  Shelah explained. "Some of the crowd are going for a swim before dinner. Care
  to go along?"</p>

  <p>Rita put one hand to her perfect coiffure, and shrugged. "Not for me," she
  cried. "I'm so sick of swimming I gag at the sight of my tub. You've no idea,
  my dear&mdash;three years married and living in Honolulu&mdash;these people
  over here are like fish. They suffocate when you bring 'em ashore."</p>

  <p>They heard the noise of a new arrival in the hall, and Alan Jaynes came
  into the room, handsome and upstanding in his dinner clothes. Shelah's heart
  sank suddenly at sight of him. While she was introducing him to the Ballous,
  Julie and Jimmy Bradshaw rushed in, wearing gay beach robes over their
  bathing-suits. They paused, with obvious reluctance, for further
  introductions.</p>

  <p>"Where's Miss Dixon?" Bradshaw inquired. "She hasn't gone out, has
  she?"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," cried Julie. "Diana will take ages. She always does."</p>

  <p>"Then the race is between us two," said the boy, and dashed through the
  open window on to the lanai, with Julie at his heels.</p>

  <p>"What a good-looking boy," Rita remarked. "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>Shelah explained Mr. Bradshaw's place in the world's work. Rita stood
  up.</p>

  <p>"Let's all go down to the beach," she said.</p>

  <p>"The beach&mdash;in high-heeled slippers?" protested Wilkie.</p>

  <p>"I can take them off, can't I?" Rita demanded. She was moving toward the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Go along," the star said. "Well follow later."</p>

  <p>Rita went out.</p>

  <p>Without enthusiasm, Wilkie lifted his great bulk from the chair. "That
  means I go, too," he explained, and did so.</p>

  <p>Shelah turned to Alan Jaynes with a nervous little laugh. "Poor
  Wilkie&mdash;he's so jealous. And with reason, I'm afraid&mdash;at least, he
  had reason in the old days."</p>

  <p>Jaynes came quickly to her side. "So sorry I couldn't see you this
  afternoon. Your headache&mdash;it's better, I trust?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Much better."</p>

  <p>"I've brought you a bit of an offering. It's hardly worthy of you, of
  course." He handed her a corsage bouquet wrapped in tissue-paper.</p>

  <p>She unwrapped it. "Lovely," she said.</p>

  <p>"But too late," remarked Jaynes. "I see you're wearing some one's
  orchids."</p>

  <p>Shelah laid his gift on a table. "Yes, Alan."</p>

  <p>"I hope that doesn't mean&mdash;" he began, frowning. "Shelah&mdash;it
  can't mean that. I&mdash;I couldn't go on without you."</p>

  <p>She faced him. "You'll have to, Alan. I'm so sorry. But I&mdash;I can't
  marry you."</p>

  <p>His expression clouded. "It's true, then," he said.</p>

  <p>"What's true?"</p>

  <p>"The thing Van Horn told me this afternoon. I refused to believe it of
  you&mdash;it's too childish&mdash;too ignorant. You sent for that damned
  fortune-telling charlatan, and he decided it for you. He advised you not to
  take me." She turned away, without speaking. The man's face flushed with
  anger. "If you had any sane reason," he continued, controlling himself with
  an effort, "I'd take my medicine quietly. But this&mdash;this is too much. To
  let a fakir&mdash;a crystal-gazer&mdash;a cheap fraud, come between
  us&mdash;by the lord, I won't stand for it. I thought on the boat you loved
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe I did," she answered sadly.</p>

  <p>"Then nothing in this world shall stop me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait, Alan, wait, please," she cried. "It's for you&mdash;I'm doing this
  for you. You must believe that. There could be no happiness for
  us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So that's what he told you, eh?"</p>

  <p>"That's what he told me, but he was only repeating what was in my heart.
  The past, Alan&mdash;the past won't die&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've told you I don't give a hang about what's past."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you don't know, Alan&mdash;and I can't tell you. I'm trying to do
  the decent thing&mdash;you're so fine and straight&mdash;I couldn't bear it
  if I ended by dragging you through the dust. Please, Alan, please&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to understand," Jaynes cried. "I only want you&mdash;to love
  and take care of&mdash;see here, my time is brief, so pitifully brief. I must
  leave at midnight&mdash;you know that. Forget this fool of a fortune-teller.
  I can't understand your faith in him, I can't approve it, but I'm willing to
  overlook it. You aren't to blame, I fancy. Your temperament, your way of
  life. Forget him, my dear, and give me your word before I go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I can't," she said brokenly. "I can't."</p>

  <p>For a long moment Jaynes looked at her. Then, with great dignity, he
  turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" Shelah cried.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered. "I must think this thing out."</p>

  <p>"But you're dining here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," the man repeated. "I couldn't talk to your friends just
  now. I want to be alone for a few minutes. I may return later." He seemed
  dazed, uncertain of himself.</p>

  <p>Shelah was at his side, her hand on his sleeve. "Alan, I'm so
  sorry&mdash;so unhappy."</p>

  <p>He turned, and took her in his arms. "By heaven&mdash;you loved me on the
  ship. I won't give you up. I can't." His glance fell on the orchids, fastened
  to the shoulder-strap of her gown by a small diamond pin. "No one shall take
  you from me," he cried and, releasing her, went quickly out.</p>

  <p>Shelah Fane walked slowly to a chair, and dropped into it. Pain and a
  desperate unhappiness were in her face, and she was not acting now. For a few
  moments she sat there, then gradually came back to her surroundings. She
  glanced at her watch&mdash;a quarter of eight. Quickly she rose and went to
  the French windows at the rear.</p>

  <p>The moon was still in hiding, and the broad lawn that lay between the
  house and the pounding surf was shrouded in darkness. She heard, far away,
  the exultant cry of Julie battling with a breaker, and then the answering
  call of Jimmy Bradshaw. There was an odd air of expectancy about her as she
  stepped out on the lanai. She crossed it to the screen door that opened on to
  the lawn and stood there, peering out. Under a near-by hau tree she thought
  she saw, in the blackness, an even blacker shadow. Suddenly it moved. With a
  little cry of recognition, she flung open the door and ran swiftly across the
  grass.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Alan Jaynes was striding grimly along Kalakaua Avenue in the
  direction of the Grand Hotel. Five minutes brought him to the cool lofty
  lobby of that famous hostelry. He passed the head bell-man, whose smile of
  welcome froze suddenly on his face as he caught the look in the Britisher's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Jaynes turned to the left, moving past shop windows filled with jade and
  Oriental silks, then past the flower booth where, earlier in the evening, he
  had purchased the bouquet which now lay unappreciated on Shelah Fane's table.
  In another moment he reached the entrance to the big lounge of the hotel, and
  stood there at the top of a short flight of steps.</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful room, with those three great arches opposite the
  entrance like triple paintings of the tropic sky. But Jaynes had no eye for
  beauty to-night. Most of the guests were at dinner, and the lounge had a
  deserted air. Seated not far away, however, talking pleasantly with an
  elderly couple who had the look of tourists, the Britisher saw the man he
  wanted.</p>

  <p>He descended the steps, and crossed to this man's chair. "Stand up," he
  ordered in a husky voice.</p>

  <p>Tarneverro the Great looked at him with an expressionless face. "I should
  have expected a bit more courtesy," he said evenly. "But then&mdash;I
  scarcely know you."</p>

  <p>"Stand up," Jaynes repeated, "and come with me. I want a talk with
  you."</p>

  <p>For a moment the fortune-teller sat, quietly measuring the man who towered
  above him. Then he rose, and making his apologies to the two old people, he
  walked at Jaynes' side down the long room.</p>

  <p>"What is all this&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>They stopped at an archway near the far end. Outside a series of brilliant
  lights bathed the hotel lawn in white, making an ideal stage-setting for some
  drama of the tropics. But the stage was empty; the drama was all inside the
  lounge.</p>

  <p>"I want an explanation," said Jaynes roughly.</p>

  <p>"An explanation of what?"</p>

  <p>"I have done myself the honor of asking Miss Shelah Fane to marry me. I
  had every reason to believe she intended to do so&mdash;but today she
  consulted you about the matter&mdash;a matter that concerns you not at all.
  You advised her against a marriage with me."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro shrugged. "I do not discuss with outsiders what goes on at my
  readings."</p>

  <p>"You're going to discuss it with me. Make up your mind to that!"</p>

  <p>"Suppose I did&mdash;what could I say? I tell my clients only what I see
  in the crystal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rot!" cried Jaynes. "You tell them whatever happens to suit your fancy.
  What was your reason for this advice to Shelah?" He came closer and stared
  into the seer's face. "Are you, by any chance, in love with her
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller smiled. "Miss Fane is most charming&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We don't need your evidence on that point&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Most charming, but I do not permit myself the unwise luxury of a
  sentimental attachment for my clients. I advised her as I did because I saw
  no happiness possible in this proposed marriage." His tone grew serious.
  "Incidentally, whether you appreciate it or not, I did you a favor
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"Really?" said Jaynes. "But I'm not asking favors of a mountebank like
  you."</p>

  <p>A dark flush spread over Tarneverro's face. "There can be no point in
  prolonging this interview," he remarked, and turned away.</p>

  <p>Jaynes seized him quickly by the arm. "We'll prolong it this far. You are
  going to Miss Fane at once and tell her you're a fraud, a fake, and that you
  wish to retract all you said to her to-day."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro shook off the other's grasp. "And if I refuse?" he said.</p>

  <p>"If you refuse," Jaynes answered, "I propose to give you a thrashing you
  won't forget for many a day."</p>

  <p>"I do refuse," said Tarneverro quietly.</p>

  <p>Jaynes' arm shot back, only to find itself in a surprisingly firm grip. He
  turned. Val Martino, the director, was at his side; his was the grip on the
  Britisher's arm. Beyond Martino, Huntley Van Horn, resplendent in Hollywood
  evening garb, looked on with an air of amused interest.</p>

  <p>"Now, now," bellowed Martino, his face even redder than usual. "Cut this
  out, please. Too much of it in the pictures already. We can't have it,
  Jaynes, we can't have it."</p>

  <p>For a moment the four stood motionless. A new figure strolled upon the
  scene, a broad bulky Chinese in a dinner coat. Tarneverro hailed him. "Ah,
  Inspector Chan. Just a moment, please."</p>

  <p>Charlie came closer. "It is Mr. Tarneverro," he remarked. "'The lifter of
  the veil.'"</p>

  <p>"Inspector," the fortune-teller said, "may I present Mr. Van Horn, and Mr.
  Martino? And this is Mr. Alan Jaynes. Inspector Chan, of the Honolulu
  police."</p>

  <p>Chan bowed gracefully. "The honor is immense. Distinguished company, as a
  blind man could see."</p>

  <p>Jaynes glared at Tarneverro. "Very good," he sneered. "Hide behind the
  skirts of the police. It's what I would expect of you."</p>

  <p>"Now, now," Martino interposed. "A slight misunderstanding, Inspector.
  There will be no trouble&mdash;I am sure the good name of the industry is too
  precious to all of us. It is certainly very precious to me."</p>

  <p>Van Horn looked at his watch. "Eight o'clock," he announced. "I believe
  I'll roll along down to Shelah's. Anybody coming?"</p>

  <p>The director shook his head. "Not yet. I'll be down presently." The actor
  walked slowly away. Martino, his grip still firm on the Britisher's arm,
  sought to lead him off. "Come out on the terrace," he pleaded. "We'll talk
  this matter over."</p>

  <p>Jaynes turned to the fortune-teller. "I'm not sailing until twelve," he
  said. "In the meantime, we may meet again." He permitted Martino to lead him
  down the room.</p>

  <p>"I trust that last prediction falls short of truth," Chan said to
  Tarneverro. "I do not have much liking for light I observe in gentleman's
  eye."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro laughed. "Oh, he'll come around. I have offended him, quite
  unintentionally." He looked thoughtfully at Charlie. "By the way, Inspector,
  this is a happy meeting. I was thinking of calling you up. Just how do you
  plan to spend the evening?"</p>

  <p>"I attend Rotary Club banquet in this hotel," Chan explained.</p>

  <p>"Good. You'll be here some time?"</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "I fear so. It happens very few after-dinner speeches are
  equipped with self-stopper."</p>

  <p>"Until eleven, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"It seems terribly possible."</p>

  <p>"I am dining at a friend's house down the beach," Tarneverro said. "At the
  house of Miss Shelah Fane, in fact. Some time between now and eleven o'clock
  I may have a very important message for you, Inspector."</p>

  <p>Chan's eyes opened slowly. "A message? Of what nature?"</p>

  <p>Tarneverro hesitated. "This morning you happened to speak of certain
  murder cases in Los Angeles that remain unsolved. I told you then that I
  preferred to keep out of that sort of thing. We are not always able to follow
  our preferences, Inspector." He moved away.</p>

  <p>"One moment," said Chan. "You have sought to quench the fire of my
  curiosity by tossing upon it a handful of straw. May I repeat my
  question&mdash;what sort of message?"</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller gave him a long look. "A message calling upon you to
  arrest the murderer of&mdash;but there, I mustn't say too much. There's many
  a slip, as you have no doubt learned from your own experience. I shall be
  happy to have you so near&mdash;until eleven, at least. After that I presume
  I can reach you at your home?"</p>

  <p>"With ease," Charlie told him.</p>

  <p>"Let us hope for success," smiled Tarneverro cryptically, and went to
  rejoin his elderly acquaintances in the center of the lounge. For a second
  Chan looked after him. Then, shrugging his broad shoulders, he turned to find
  the banquet room.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">III. &mdash; FLOWERS FOR SHELAH FANE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Huntley Van Horn strolled down Kalakaua Avenue in the
  direction of Shelah Fane's house. On this tiny island in the midst of the
  rolling Pacific, few outward signs of a romantic past survived. He might have
  been on Hollywood Boulevard: the parade of automobiles along that stretch of
  American asphalt was constant, a trolley clattered by, he walked on a
  concrete sidewalk under the soft yellow glow of modern street-lamps. Yet,
  beyond the range of those lamps, he was conscious of the black velvet of a
  tropic night. He caught the odor of ginger blossoms and plumeria, a croton
  hedge gave way to one of hibiscus, topped with pale pink flowers that were
  doomed to die at midnight.</p>

  <p>He came to the number Shelah had impressed on his memory and turned in
  through the gates on to a broad drive that curved before a wide front door.
  Passing beneath a prolific banyan tree, two centuries older than the motion
  pictures, he rang the bell. Jessop admitted him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Van Horn," the butler said. "I'm happy to see you again."</p>

  <p>"How have you been?" the actor inquired.</p>

  <p>"In splendid health, sir. I trust you enjoyed your little jaunt to
  Tahiti?"</p>

  <p>Van Horn tossed down the straw hat he had substituted for the silk topper
  in which he had won the approval of several million women. "A primitive
  country, Tahiti," he smiled. "It would have reminded you of Hollywood,
  Jessop."</p>

  <p>The butler permitted himself a discreet smile. Van Horn pushed on into the
  living-room, and Jessop followed.</p>

  <p>"No one here?" the actor cried. "Lord&mdash;am I as early as all
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, Mr. Van Horn. Some of the guests are enjoying the bathing, which
  I understand is rather famous in certain quarters. A few, I believe, are on
  the beach. Would you care to join the&mdash;er&mdash;the other young people
  in the water, sir?"</p>

  <p>Van Horn grinned. "The diplomatic service lost a good man in you.
  No&mdash;much as I am tempted to classify myself with youth, the matter
  involves too damn much dressing and undressing. I shall remain, high and dry,
  on the shore."</p>

  <p>"Just as well, sir," nodded Jessop. "It is already eight-fifteen, and the
  dinner hour is rapidly approaching. I shall be forced to summon them in
  shortly."</p>

  <p>Van Horn stared about the room. "What&mdash;no cocktails?"</p>

  <p>"There has been a slight delay, sir. The gentleman who was to supply us
  with the raw material&mdash;the very raw material, between you and me,
  sir&mdash;has only just come. I was busy with the shaker when you rang." He
  went over and stood by the French window opening on to the lanai. "You will
  find the ocean just out here, sir," he explained.</p>

  <p>Van Horn laughed, and stepped on to the lanai. The butler followed him to
  the screen door, and held it open.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," said the actor. "I hear the roar of surf. No doubt I shall find
  the sea in that same general neighborhood." He paused in the doorway, and
  indicated a light gleaming through the trees some distance to the right.
  "What's over there?"</p>

  <p>"It's a sort of summer-house, or pavilion, sir," Jessop explained. "At
  least, it would be a summer-house in England, where we have summers. It may
  be a few of the guests are in there."</p>

  <p>Van Horn went out on the lawn, and started across it in the direction of
  the light. Suddenly he heard, above the pounding of the breakers, voices on
  the beach. He stood for a moment, undecided which way to go.</p>

  <p>Jessop, meanwhile, returned to the living-room. An old bent Chinese came
  shuffling in.</p>

  <p>"My dear Wu Kno-ching," the butler protested, "in a well-run house, the
  cook's place is in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>The old man blandly ignored the rebuke. "What time dinnah?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"As I have told you, the dinner is set for eight-thirty," replied Jessop.
  "It may, however, be somewhat delayed."</p>

  <p>Wu Kno-ching shrugged. "Wha' kin' house this is? Dinnah mebbe sometime
  plitty soon aftah while. I get dinnah ready&mdash;boss say wait&mdash;dinnah
  goes to hell." He departed, murmuring further reproof.</p>

  <p>The screen door slammed behind Wilkie Ballou; he crossed the lanai
  aimlessly and entered the living-room.</p>

  <p>"I fear this idea of a swim is going to delay dinner, sir," Jessop said to
  him.</p>

  <p>"What? Oh, yes&mdash;I suppose so. Have you any cigarettes here? My case
  is empty."</p>

  <p>Jessop proffered a box containing cigarettes, and taking one, Ballou
  dropped into a chair. The butler officiated with a match, then retired to the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>Returning fifteen minutes later, he found the Honolulu man sitting just as
  he had left him.</p>

  <p>"Things are getting rather serious, sir," Jessop remarked. He carried a
  large dinner gong. "I had always supposed, from my reading, that the Chinese
  are a notably patient race."</p>

  <p>"They have that reputation, yes," nodded Ballou.</p>

  <p>"Their representative in our kitchen, sir, is doing nothing to sustain
  it," Jessop sighed. "He informs me with great passion that dinner is waiting.
  I'll just go down to the shore and see what this will do." He nodded toward
  the gong and disappeared. Presently he could be heard in the distance,
  beating a not unmusical tattoo.</p>

  <p>Ballou lighted a fresh cigarette. Jessop returned, and at his heels came
  Rita Ballou and Van Horn.</p>

  <p>"You should have stayed, Wilkie," Rita said. "I've just been getting all
  the latest Hollywood gossip."</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested," Ballou growled.</p>

  <p>"Poor Wilkie," his wife smiled. "It's close to his bedtime, and he hasn't
  even had his dinner. Cheer up. It won't be long now."</p>

  <p>Diana Dixon arrived, quite out of breath. "I suppose we're late," she
  cried. "You should have been in with us. It was glorious&mdash;but not half
  long enough. I could have stayed for hours. Cocktails&mdash;that's an
  idea."</p>

  <p>She took one from the tray which Jessop held before her. The other guests
  likewise needed no urging. Huntley Van Horn lifted his glass.</p>

  <p>"To our hostess, if any," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"That's right&mdash;what's become of Shelah?" Rita Ballou said. "We saw
  her for a moment when we came&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shelah," said Van Horn, with a cynical smile, "is no doubt lurking in the
  background waiting to make a grand and impressive entrance. She will ride in
  on a white charger, or descend on us from a balloon. You know, she goes in
  for that sort of thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Julie and Jimmy Bradshaw rushed in, glowing and in high spirits. "Hello,
  Mr. Van Horn," the girl cried. "Are you all that's come?"</p>

  <p>"To think," he groaned, "that you could be so rude to me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know what I mean," she laughed. "Where are all our other guests?
  Val Martino, Mr. Jaynes, Tarneverro&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tarneverro coming?" Van Horn lifted his eyebrows. "In that case, I will
  have a second cocktail. Thanks so much."</p>

  <p>Quite unexpectedly there was the sound of steel guitars at the front door,
  and of many fresh young voices singing a Hawaiian song. Julie cried out with
  delight.</p>

  <p>"A serenade from Shelah's admirers," she said. "Isn't that sweet? She will
  be pleased." Her beach robe streaming behind her, she ran to the door and
  threw it open. She stood gazing out at a vast throng of high-school girls,
  laden with flowers. They stopped their song, and a young Japanese girl
  stepped forward. "We would like to see Shelah Fane, please."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Julie. "Just wait, and I'll get her. While you're
  waiting, if you don't mind&mdash;will you sing The Song of the Islands? It's
  Miss Fane's favorite, you know."</p>

  <p>She left the door open and returned to the living-room. "Come on,
  Jimmy&mdash;we'll find Shelah. I think she's in the pavilion."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Jimmy. They went out on the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't be better," Julie cried. "For Shelah's entrance on the party, I
  mean. That crowd outside serenading her as she comes in&mdash;she'd love
  it."</p>

  <p>"Good lord," said Bradshaw, disapproval in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know," the girl answered. "It's silly, but poor Shelah's what she
  is. Her life has made her so, and she can't change." They went on across the
  soft lawn under the hau trees and the algarobas. The sweet haunting strains
  of The Song of the Islands came to them on the evening breeze. "Hurry," Julie
  said, "Shelah must get in there before that song ends."</p>

  <p>She ran up the steps of the pavilion, with Bradshaw close behind. He
  pushed open the door of the single room. For a second he stood there, then he
  turned swiftly and caught the girl in his arms.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he cried. "Don't go any farther."</p>

  <p>His tone frightened her. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Turn around and go back," he pleaded, but she tore away from him and ran
  inside.</p>

  <p>"You'll be sorry," he warned.</p>

  <p>And she was sorry, it seemed, for above the voices of the serenaders and
  the distant whine of steel guitars, her own voice rose in a sharp cry of
  fright and terror.</p>

  <p>Shelah Fane lay on the floor beside a small straight-backed chair. She had
  been stabbed through the heart; her priceless ivory gown was stained with
  crimson. Outside, that little group of her admirers continued to sing
  fervently their serenade.</p>

  <p>Julie knelt by the star's side, and Bradshaw looked away. In a moment he
  went over and lifted the girl to her feet. "We'd better go," he said gently.
  "There's nothing we can do."</p>

  <p>He led her to the door. She looked up at him through her tears. "But
  who&mdash;who&mdash;" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;" he answered. "That, I'm afraid, is the big question
  now."</p>

  <p>He found, on the inside of the pavilion door, an unexpected key. They went
  outside, and the boy locked the door, putting the key in his pocket. Slowly
  they walked back to the house. Huntley Van Horn greeted them.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Shelah?" he said. "The stage is all set. Her guests are
  gathered in the living-room, her great public is singing lustily at the
  door&mdash;it's a grand entrance&mdash;" He stopped at sight of Julie's
  face.</p>

  <p>"What's happened?" cried Rita Ballou shrilly.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw stood looking about the little group. Jessop came in and, picking
  up the silver tray on which he had served the cocktails, prepared to collect
  the empty glasses. Outside the door, The Song of the Islands trailed off into
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Shelah Fane has been murdered in the pavilion," said the boy in a low
  voice.</p>

  <p>There was a sudden crash. Jessop had been guilty of his first error in
  forty years of service. He had dropped the silver tray.</p>

  <p>"I beg pardon," he said to no one in particular.</p>

  <p>Outside, Shelah Fane's admirers began another song. Bradshaw dashed
  through the curtains to the front door.</p>

  <p>"Please," he cried. "Please&mdash;no more to-night. You must go away now.
  Miss Fane can't see you. She is&mdash;she is ill."</p>

  <p>"We are so sorry," said the girl who seemed to be the leader. "Will you
  give her the flowers, please?"</p>

  <p>They began to load him down with fragrant blossoms. Presently he staggered
  back into the hallway, his arms filled with a riot of color. Julie was
  standing there, her eyes wide, her face deathly pale.</p>

  <p>"Flowers," said Bradshaw. "Flowers for Shelah Fane."</p>

  <p>With a choking cry, Julie fell in a heap at his feet.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">IV. &mdash; THE CAMEL AT THE GATE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Down at the Grand Hotel, Charlie Chan was well started on
  what he perceived was going to be an excellent dinner. The hour of Rotarian
  oratory was not near enough to worry him, the food was good and he felt at
  peace with the world. He did not know the name of the small fish that lay on
  the plate before him, but one taste had led him to approve most heartily of
  its quality. He was leaning forward to apply himself with increased diligence
  to the task at hand, when a bell-boy touched him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You are wanted on telephone very quick," said the boy.</p>

  <p>A sense of vague unrest troubled him as he walked down the long lobby to
  the telephone booth. He would have preferred a life of quiet meditation, but
  a ruthless fate was always breaking in upon him with some new problem that
  must be solved. What now, he wondered, as he entered the booth and pulled the
  door to behind him.</p>

  <p>He was greeted by an excited young voice. "Say, Charlie,&mdash;this is Jim
  Bradshaw of the Tourist Bureau. Huntley Van Horn told me I could find you at
  the hotel."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and now you have found me. What is it that has brought you to
  this state of high disturbance?"</p>

  <p>In jumbled phrases Bradshaw poured out his story. Charlie listened
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"Shelah Fane," the boy was saying. "You know what that means, Charlie.
  This news of mine will be cabled all over the world to-night. You're going to
  be in the limelight as you never were before. Better get down here as fast as
  you can."</p>

  <p>"I will arrive at once," Charlie answered. Was that a sigh, Bradshaw
  wondered, that came over the wire? "Let nothing be touched until I touch it,"
  the detective added.</p>

  <p>He hung up, then called the police station and gave certain directions. At
  last he came from the booth, mopping his perspiring brow with his
  handkerchief. For a moment he stood motionless, as though gathering his
  strength for the task that lay before him. Another case, another murder, and
  he knew that what the boy had said was true: this time he would work in a
  bright spotlight indeed. Shelah Fane! Not for nothing did he have numerous
  children who, as he often said, were movie crazed. He knew only too well the
  interest that had always centered about the woman who now lay dead a short
  distance down the beach.</p>

  <p>"A thousand-mile journey begins with one step," he sighed, and took
  it&mdash;in the direction of his hat.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the door of the hotel, he encountered Tarneverro. The
  fortune-teller also carried a hat, and seemed on the point of going out.
  "Hello, Inspector," he said. "You haven't finished your dinner already?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," Charlie answered. "I am rudely wrenched away by important
  business. The most important I have encountered for some time."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" returned Tarneverro lightly.</p>

  <p>Charlie's small eyes were fixed upon the other's face with a fierce
  intensity. Not too soon to collect impressions, to weigh, to measure, to
  study.</p>

  <p>"Miss Shelah Fane," he said slowly, "is just now found murdered at her
  home."</p>

  <p>For hours afterward he was to speculate upon the look that crossed that
  dark mysterious face.</p>

  <p>"Shelah!" Tarneverro cried. "Good God!"</p>

  <p>"You were on your way there, perhaps?" Charlie continued.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;yes&mdash;of course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do me the honor to ride with me. I desire to ask questions."</p>

  <p>Val Martino hurried up. "I say, Tarneverro&mdash;are you going down the
  beach?"</p>

  <p>Tarneverro told him the news. The director heard it with surprising
  calmness.</p>

  <p>"Too bad," he said evenly. He was thoughtful. "Well, there goes six
  months' hard work. That picture's ruined. I'll never find anybody to double
  for her&mdash;I've tried it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good lord, man!" cried Tarneverro angrily. "Shelah is dead, and you
  babble about your picture."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Martino. "Sorry for poor Shelah. But even in the movies, the
  show must go on."</p>

  <p>"What became of that fellow Jaynes?" Tarneverro asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Right after we left you, he shook me off and strolled down the beach. He
  was in a state of mind&mdash;well, you saw that. Wasn't coming to the
  dinner&mdash;but I fancy I'd better find him and bring him down, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," Chan said hurriedly. "I must see him. Come, Mr. Tarneverro.
  Speed is necessary." He led the fortune-teller out to the drive, where his
  battered flivver was waiting. "The vehicle is none too grand," he apologized,
  "but it moves. Will you kindly leap inside?"</p>

  <p>Silently Tarneverro climbed into the little two-seater. Charlie started
  the car.</p>

  <p>"This is a terrible thing," the fortune-teller said. "Poor Shelah&mdash;I
  can scarcely realize it."</p>

  <p>Charlie shrugged. "Time to be philosophical," he suggested. "You have
  perhaps heard old Eastern saying. 'Death is the black camel that kneels unbid
  at every gate.' Sooner or later&mdash;does it matter which?"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," Tarneverro continued. "But, in a way, I'm afraid I'm
  responsible for this. Oh, lord, the more I think about it, the clearer it
  becomes. Poor Shelah's blood is on my head."</p>

  <p>"Your remarks have interesting sound," Charlie remarked, as the car moved
  through the hotel gates on to the avenue. "Explain, if you will be so
  kind."</p>

  <p>"This evening," the fortune-teller went on, "I told you I might call on
  you to make an arrest in a very important murder case. I fully expected to do
  so. I'll tell you what I meant by that, as briefly as possible.</p>

  <p>"Shelah Fane had cabled me from the ship, asking me to meet her here. It
  seems that this fellow Jaynes had proposed to her, and she wanted my advice.
  For some time past she had been in the habit of coming to me with all her
  problems. She loved Jaynes, she wanted to marry him&mdash;but she was afraid
  of what the future might hold in store. She feared that at any moment the
  world might discover that for three years or more she had gone about burdened
  with a terrible secret."</p>

  <p>"What secret?" Charlie inquired.</p>

  <p>"This morning," Tarneverro continued, "you spoke of Denny Mayo, who was
  found dead in his home in Los Angeles some three years ago. The police have
  been at sea on the case from the start. But Shelah Fane&mdash;she knew who
  murdered Denny Mayo. She was in Mayo's house, paying a harmless call, on the
  night of the murder. The door-bell rang, and she foolishly hid in another
  room. She saw the thing done. All this she confessed to me this morning. What
  is more, she told me that Denny Mayo's murderer is at this moment in
  Honolulu."</p>

  <p>Charlie's eyes gleamed in the dark. "She told you the name?"</p>

  <p>Tarneverro shook his head. "I'm sorry. She didn't want to, and I made no
  effort to press her. Her reason, of course, for not revealing her connection
  with this affair at the time, was that to do so would ruin her career. She
  has kept silent all these years, but she hesitated to marry a man of whom she
  was really fond and perhaps drag him through some very unpleasant publicity
  later on."</p>

  <p>"A natural hesitation," Chan approved. "You encouraged it?" He had stopped
  the car in the drive of Shelah's house, but he made no move to alight.</p>

  <p>"I did, of course," Tarneverro said. "More than that, I strongly advised
  her to lift this burden from her mind and find peace at last. I assured her
  that if she revealed the name of the guilty person of her own accord, no
  police in the world would be inclined to punish her for her long silence. I
  trust I was right in that?"</p>

  <p>"Speaking for myself only, yes," nodded Charlie.</p>

  <p>"I suggested she refuse Jaynes for the present, and go through with this
  unpleasant duty which I felt she owed to society. I said I thought it would
  be extremely foolish for her to marry any man with such a threat hanging over
  her happiness. If he really cared for her, I pointed out, Jaynes would marry
  her in the end. If he didn't care that much, then it was better to discover
  it now."</p>

  <p>They alighted and stood under the banyan tree. Charlie peered into the
  fortune-teller's face. "And if Jaynes did not marry her&mdash;" he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Tarneverro shrugged. "You are on the wrong track there," he said. "I had
  no sentimental interest in Shelah Fane. But I didn't fancy my role&mdash;the
  secret she confided in me was a bit more than I'd bargained for. I felt, too,
  that for the sake of her own happiness she ought to get rid of this burden at
  last. So I pleaded with her to make public the name of the guilty person in
  the Mayo case."</p>

  <p>"And she agreed?" Charlie asked.</p>

  <p>"Not precisely. The idea rather frightened her. She said she would think
  it over, and give me her decision tonight. 'Write me a brief statement, with
  that name included,' I told her, 'give it to me at dinner this evening, and I
  will make everything as easy for you as possible.' I was confident of gaining
  my point, or I would never have spoken to you about it. Yes, I would have
  gained it&mdash;but now&mdash;now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now," Chan said, "the killer of Denny Mayo has silenced this woman for
  ever."</p>

  <p>"Precisely."</p>

  <p>"But in what manner did this person discover she was hovering on a point
  of revealment?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you," Tarneverro replied. "There is a balcony outside my
  room. That's a possibility, but not a likely one, I fear. Or it may be that
  Shelah consulted the killer, told him&mdash;or her&mdash;that she could no
  longer remain silent. It would have been like her. She was indiscreet,
  impulsive." They moved toward the steps. "I hope that what I have told you
  will prove helpful, Inspector. It gives you the motive, at least, and it
  narrows your search. Believe me, I shall be at your side through this
  investigation. You are going to have all the help I can possibly give you. I
  want, even more than you, the name of Shelah's murderer."</p>

  <p>"Your help will be valuable indeed," Chan told him. "What did I say to you
  this morning&mdash;you are number one detective yourself. I did not dream
  that so soon we would be working side by side."</p>

  <p>Jessop admitted them, and they went into the living-room where the two
  Ballous and Van Horn sat in gloomy silence. Charlie stood gazing at this
  small group with thoughtful deliberation. Jimmy Bradshaw entered behind him,
  his bathing-suit abandoned for dinner clothes.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Charlie," he said in a low voice. "You're needed here, all right.
  In the pavilion&mdash;clear over to the right on the lawn. I locked the door
  as soon as we found what had happened. Here's the key."</p>

  <p>"You are bright boy," said Charlie, pleased. "That fact has long been
  apparent as the morning sun." He turned to the others. "It will naturally be
  understood that no one leaves this house until I grant permission. Mr.
  Tarneverro, will you kindly accompany me?"</p>

  <p>He walked with the fortune-teller in silence across the lawn, white now
  under the rising moon. Chan went up the steps first, and unlocked the door.
  With marked reluctance, Tarneverro followed.</p>

  <p>Charlie went over and dropped down on one knee beside Shelah Fane. Slowly
  he looked from her to the fortune-teller. "Long time I have been in present
  business," he said softly, "but rough blunt feelings do not come natural to
  me yet. I am sorry for this lady. Never before this moment have I seen
  her&mdash;yet I am so very sorry." He stood up. "The black camel has knelt at
  plenty famous gate to-night," he added.</p>

  <p>Tarneverro remained some distance from the body. He seemed to control
  himself with an effort. "Poor Shelah!" he muttered. "Life was very sweet to
  her."</p>

  <p>"It is sweet to all of us," Charlie nodded. "Even the beggar hesitates to
  cross a rotting bridge."</p>

  <p>"I can never forgive myself," the other continued. "What you see here
  began this morning in my apartment."</p>

  <p>"What is to be, will be," Chan comforted. "We will not move unfortunate
  one until arrival of coroner. I have already telephoned the station. But we
  will look about, Mr. Tarneverro. Do not forget&mdash;you are to help." He
  knelt again, and lifted Shelah Fane's left arm. "Here is already some
  evidence. There has been a struggle, and wrist-watch was smashed in process.
  Crystal is broken, and"&mdash;he placed the watch to his ear&mdash;"the
  working of the timepiece immediately ceased to function. The hands remain
  stationary at two minutes past eight. So soon, without an effort, we know
  exact moment of tragedy. That is indeed something."</p>

  <p>"Two minutes after eight," Tarneverro said. "At that moment, Jaynes,
  Martino, Van Horn, you and I were in the lounge of the hotel.
  Remember&mdash;Van Horn looked at his watch, remarked it was eight o'clock,
  and said he was starting down here."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Chan nodded. "The alibis arrive in one huge flock." He
  pointed to the orchids, crushed on the floor. "Further evidence of the
  struggle. Bouquet was torn off, trampled under foot."</p>

  <p>"All of which looks a bit like jealousy," responded Tarneverro, frowning.
  "Can we be wrong about the motive, after all? No&mdash;it might be anger,
  too."</p>

  <p>Charlie was crawling about the rug. "Peculiar thing," he remarked.
  "Flowers were fastened by pin&mdash;you may note the shoulder-strap is
  torn&mdash;but no pin is here now." He examined the orchids, and made a
  thorough search of the floor, while Tarneverro watched him. "It is true," he
  added, standing up, "the pin which fastened flowers is strangely
  missing."</p>

  <p>He stepped to an old mahogany dressing-table, a handsome piece in its day,
  but now banished to the beach house. The table had a glass top, and leaning
  over, he studied this with a microscope he had taken from his pocket. "One
  more point," he said. "This corner here has lately received fierce nick. What
  can that mean?"</p>

  <p>Tarneverro had picked up an expensive gold mesh bag that was lying on the
  table, and was studying the contents. "No use," he said. "The usual compact,
  and a few dollars. For a moment I had a crazy thought that perhaps Shelah had
  already written down for me that name we want. It would have been a very
  happy chance. The case would have been over before it started."</p>

  <p>"Cases do not permit themselves the luxury of such easy solution," sighed
  Chan. "If letter such as you warmly desire had been in this room, murderer
  would have it now. No&mdash;fate is never so kind. We must take long way
  round. Come&mdash;we have finished here for the present. Much more to be done
  later."</p>

  <p>They went out, and Charlie locked the door. As they moved across the lawn,
  he enumerated the clues. "A watch stopped at two minutes past eight in fierce
  struggle. A bouquet of orchids crushed in same, the pin that held them in
  place oddly lost. A fresh nick on glass corner of dressing-table. Enough for
  the moment, maybe."</p>

  <p>As they entered the living-room, Jessop was ushering in Martino and Alan
  Jaynes. The latter's face was pale beneath its bronze, and he was obviously
  much upset.</p>

  <p>"We will all acquire chairs," Chan suggested. "Many questions must now be
  asked."</p>

  <p>Jessop came forward and faced Tarneverro. "I'm sorry, sir," he said. "With
  all the excitement, I quite forgot it."</p>

  <p>"Forgot what?" asked Tarneverro, surprised.</p>

  <p>"This letter, sir." He took a large elaborate envelope from his pocket.
  "Miss Fane requested me to give it to you the moment you arrived."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro stretched forth his hand, but Charlie stepped quickly between
  them. He took the envelope. "So sorry. But the police are in charge here
  now."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, sir," Jessop bowed, and backed away.</p>

  <p>Chan stood there, a rather helpless-looking figure, holding the letter in
  his hand. Could it be true? Was the answer to this puzzle so soon within his
  grasp? A long understanding look passed between him and Tarneverro. The room
  seemed filled with people, milling about, seeking chairs. Charlie lifted his
  right hand to slit the envelope.</p>

  <p>The floor lamp furnished the only illumination in the room. Chan took a
  step nearer it; he had the envelope open now, and was about to remove the
  contents. Suddenly the lamp went out, and the room was plunged into darkness.
  There followed the sound of a blow, then another, a cry and the fall of a
  rather solid body.</p>

  <p>The place was in an uproar. Out of the blackness came an insistent demand
  for lights. The lamps in the wall brackets flashed on revealing Jessop at the
  switch.</p>

  <p>Charlie was slowly rising from the floor. He rubbed his right cheek, which
  was bleeding slightly.</p>

  <p>"Overwhelmed with regret," he said, glancing at Tarneverro. "Famous god
  Jove, I hear, nodded on occasion. For myself, I fear I have just taken most
  unfortunate nap." He held out his left hand, in which was a tiny fragment of
  envelope. "Vital portion of letter," he added, "seems to have traveled
  elsewhere."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">V. &mdash; THE MAN IN THE OVERCOAT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a long moment Chan stood with that fragment of letter in
  his hand. His expression was calm and unruffled, a very inaccurate indication
  of what was going on in his heart. Before a room filled with people some
  person had tricked and therefore disgraced the famous detective of the
  Honolulu police.</p>

  <p>Charlie Chan had lost face in the presence of seven witnesses. Though he
  had lived many years in Hawaii, he was still Oriental enough to feel a hot
  bitter anger that startled even himself.</p>

  <p>He sought to conquer that feeling immediately. Anger, he had been taught,
  is a poison that destroys the mind, and he would have need of all his
  faculties in the ordeal that impended. In this affair he was face to face
  with an adversary who was not only in a desperate mood, but who was also
  clever and quick to act. Well, so much the better, Charlie told himself; he
  would find all the more satisfaction in defeating such an opponent in the
  end. For he would win out; on that he was fiercely determined. The unknown
  person who had killed, first Denny Mayo, and then, to protect that secret,
  Shelah Fane, would be brought to justice at last, or Inspector Chan could
  never find peace again.</p>

  <p>Tarneverro was glaring at him with ill-concealed indignation. "So sorry,"
  he remarked coldly, "but the police are in charge here now."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "You are eminently correct in that sneer. Never before in my
  life has such a happening aroused itself in my path. But I give you my
  word"&mdash;he looked slowly around the little group&mdash;"the person who
  struck that blow will pay. I am in no mood that turns the other cheek
  to-night."</p>

  <p>He took out his handkerchief and applied it to the cheek that had,
  unfortunately, been already turned. It did not need the trace of red on the
  white linen to tell him that the hand that had hit him wore a ring. His right
  cheek&mdash;then the blow had probably come from some one's left hand. On the
  left hand of Van Horn, he noted a large seal ring; he turned to Wilkie
  Ballou, and on that gentleman's left hand he caught the glint of a diamond.
  Covertly he pursued his study; Bradshaw, Martino, Tarneverro and Jaynes were
  all innocent of jewelry.</p>

  <p>Tarneverro held his arms aloft. "You may start with me," he said. "You
  are, of course, going to search every one in this room."</p>

  <p>Charlie smiled. "I am not quite such fool as that. Person who favored me
  with vigorous blow is not likely to hold incriminating letter in guilty
  possession. Besides," he added casually, as he walked away, "the matter is of
  small importance anyhow."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro lowered his arms. It was quite evident from his expression that
  he heartily disapproved Charlie's omission of what he considered an essential
  move. But Chan ignored him. The detective was making a swift examination of
  the cord which stretched from the lamp to an electrical socket a few inches
  above the floor. The plug, wrenched from its place, lay before him, its two
  protruding prongs mute evidence that its removal had been a simple matter. It
  had only been necessary to step on the cord anywhere along its length, move
  the foot a short distance away from the wall, and the thing was done. Simple,
  yes, but a bit of quick thinking on some one's part. Charlie restored the
  plug, and the lamp flashed on again.</p>

  <p>He came back to the center of the room. "We waste no time in fruitless
  search for letter now," he remarked. "I propose instead to fix in my mind our
  little group of characters, and perhaps learn from their lips just what they
  were engaged in doing at two minutes past eight to-night." He stood gazing at
  them thoughtfully. "I have some hesitation where to begin. Mr. Ballou, yours
  is familiar face, so I will start in your vicinity. Will you kindly state
  position in this house of yourself and Mrs. Ballou?"</p>

  <p>The millionaire looked at him with all the arrogance of the white man who
  has lived for a long time among what he considers inferior races. "Why should
  I do that?" he inquired carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Murder has been committed," replied Charlie sternly. "I recognize your
  high position on this island, but you are not above question. Will you deign
  to reply, please?"</p>

  <p>"We came here as dinner guests," Ballou said. "We are&mdash;we were old
  friends of Miss Fane."</p>

  <p>"You knew her in Hollywood?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ballou was, before her marriage to you, herself actress on famous
  silver screen?"</p>

  <p>"What if she was?" flared Ballou.</p>

  <p>"Why not be polite, Wilkie?" rebuked his wife. "Yes, Inspector, I was in
  the pictures, under the name of Rita Montaine. And if I do say it, I was
  rather well known."</p>

  <p>Chan bowed. "Could one of your charm be otherwise? May I inquire, please,
  how long you have been married?"</p>

  <p>"Three years this month," she told him amiably.</p>

  <p>"You resided, perhaps, in Hollywood up to moment of your marriage?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>"Do you recall&mdash;was Mr. Ballou in Hollywood for some time previous to
  that marriage?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he hung around for several months, pleading with me to give up
  my career and take him." Her husband snorted. "You may not recall it now,
  Wilkie, but you did."</p>

  <p>"What the devil," cried Ballou irritably, "has all that got to do with the
  murder of Shelah Fane? I believe, Inspector, that you are exceeding your
  authority. You'd better be careful&mdash;I'm not without
  influence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So sorry," said Chan soothingly. "I will come at once to the present. You
  arrived here to-night at what hour?"</p>

  <p>"At seven-thirty," he answered. "The dinner was not until eight-thirty,
  but Mrs. Ballou got the invitation over the telephone, and as usual"&mdash;he
  glared at his wife&mdash;"she balled things up."</p>

  <p>"At seven-thirty," put in Chan hastily, cutting off Rita's reply.
  "Describe actions down to present moment, please."</p>

  <p>"What are you getting at?" objected Ballou roughly. "You don't think I
  killed Shelah Fane, do you? By gad, I'll speak to some one down at the
  station about this. Do you know who I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, who are you, anyhow, Wilkie?" his wife put in wearily. "Why not tell
  the Inspector what he wants to know and have done with it?" She turned to
  Chan. "We arrived about seven-thirty, and after a little chat with Miss Fane,
  stepped out on the beach to watch the bathers. It was about a quarter to
  eight when we went out there, I imagine."</p>

  <p>"You were engaged in this manner how long?"</p>

  <p>"Answering for myself, I was on the beach until Jessop came out at
  eight-thirty. About ten minutes before that, Mr. Van Horn joined us and my
  husband got up and strolled toward the house."</p>

  <p>"At two minutes past eight, then, yourself and husband were seated side by
  side on sand. You heard no cry or other indication of disturbance?"</p>

  <p>"None at all. The two girls in the water were doing more or less
  screaming&mdash;you know how people will. But that's not the sort of thing
  you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Not precisely," replied Chan. "Thank you so much. We drop you for the
  present."</p>

  <p>Julie O'Neill came slowly into the room. The new pink evening gown she had
  looked forward to wearing at the party was back on its hangar, and she had
  donned a simple little dress of gray chiffon. Her face was still decidedly
  pale, but she seemed calm and collected now. Chan turned to her.</p>

  <p>"Good evening. I am so sorry to be here. Not until this moment have I
  encountered the pleasant thrill of seeing you. Would you mind informing me
  just who you are?"</p>

  <p>Bradshaw came forward. He introduced Julie to Chan, and went on to explain
  the girl's place in the household.</p>

  <p>"My heart's deepest sympathy," Charlie remarked. "As mere matter of form,
  I must ask about your actions during this most tragic evening."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you all about that," Bradshaw informed him, "and kill two
  birds&mdash;oh, sorry&mdash;I mean to say, give you my own story at the same
  time. I arrived at the house early for a swim with Miss O'Neill. The last
  time we saw Miss Fane was in this room when we came down dressed for the
  water&mdash;that was about seventy-forty. She was here with Mr. and Mrs.
  Ballou, and Mr. Jaynes."</p>

  <p>"You went immediately to the beach?"</p>

  <p>"We did&mdash;and on into the water. It was marvelous&mdash;pardon me if I
  put in a small advertisement for the local bathing beach. What I mean to say
  is, Miss O'Neill and I were together from the time we saw Miss Fane until
  about eight-thirty, when Jessop rang the gong calling us in. It was soon
  after that we made our unhappy discovery."</p>

  <p>"You remained in water at all times?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;we came back to the beach now and then. Mrs. Ballou was
  there from the start, as she says. Mr. Ballou disappeared toward the last and
  Mr. Van Horn showed up."</p>

  <p>"At two minutes past eight, then, you and Miss Julie were either in water
  or making brief excursion to shore?"</p>

  <p>"One or the other&mdash;we had no means of knowing the time, of course. It
  went very quickly. We were surprised when Jessop called us in."</p>

  <p>Chan turned to the girl. "Miss Fane was wearing tonight pretty nice
  bouquet of orchids on shoulder?"</p>

  <p>Julie nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Fastened with pin, no doubt?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"Did you by any chance note the pin?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. But I remember her saying she was going to her room to get
  one. Perhaps her maid can tell you about that."</p>

  <p>"Are you in position to know who it was sent those orchids?"</p>

  <p>"I am," Julie replied. "There was no name, but Miss Fane recognized the
  writing on the card. She said they came from her ex-husband, Bob
  somebody&mdash;he's an actor playing with a stock company in Honolulu."</p>

  <p>"Bob Fyfe," explained Rita Ballou. "He's in the company down at the Royal.
  They were married when Shelah was quite young, and I believe she was always
  very fond of him, even after their divorce."</p>

  <p>Alan Jaynes rose and, taking a small cigar from a case, lighted it, then
  walked nervously about the room, seeking a place to throw the match.</p>

  <p>"A discarded husband," mused Charlie. "Ah, yes, I would expect at least
  one of those. This man should be notified at once, and arrive here with all
  speed possible."</p>

  <p>"I'll attend to it, Charlie," offered Jimmy Bradshaw.</p>

  <p>"Warmest thanks," Chan remarked. As the boy left the room, he turned to
  the others. "We now resume somewhat rude questioning. Mr. Van Horn, you are
  actor, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps?" laughed Van Horn. "Well, that's flattering. The reward of ten
  years' hard work."</p>

  <p>"You have, then, been in Hollywood for the past ten years?"</p>

  <p>"Ten years and a half&mdash;lost in what the amiable Mr. Mencken calls the
  sewers of Hollywood."</p>

  <p>"And before that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, before that I led a most romantic life&mdash;ask my press-agent."</p>

  <p>"I seek to determine facts," Charlie said.</p>

  <p>"In that case I shall have to tell you that I came there wide-eyed and
  innocent, from an engineering school. I planned to build bridges, but my
  fatal beauty intervened."</p>

  <p>"You have appeared with Miss Shelah Fane in other pictures before this
  one?"</p>

  <p>"No." Van Horn grew more serious. "I scarcely knew her until I was engaged
  for this part."</p>

  <p>"I do not need to ask where you were at two minutes past eight to-night?"
  Chan continued.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't," the actor agreed. "I was in the same room with you.
  You'll remember I looked at my watch and remarked that it was eight o'clock,
  and that I was toddling along down here. At two minutes past the hour I was
  still where you could see me&mdash;if you cared to avail yourself of the
  privilege."</p>

  <p>"You came to this house immediately?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I walked. Exercise&mdash;that's how I keep in trim. I got here
  about eight-fifteen&mdash;I didn't hurry. Jessop let me in, we had a little
  chat, and at about eight-twenty I joined Mrs. Ballou on the beach, as you've
  already heard."</p>

  <p>Jimmy Bradshaw returned. "I got that man Fyfe at the theater," he
  announced. "My news just about bowled the poor fellow over. He said he would
  be through after the second act, and would come right along."</p>

  <p>"Thank you most warmly," Chan nodded. "You have most helpful nature." He
  turned to Martino. "You are what they call a director, I think."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they call me that," replied Martino grimly. "Among other
  things."</p>

  <p>"You have been engaged in this work a long time?"</p>

  <p>"Not very long. I was formerly an actor, on the English stage. Got
  interested in the pictures, you know, and eventually went to Hollywood."</p>

  <p>"Could you mention date of arrival?"</p>

  <p>"Surely. I landed there two years ago last March."</p>

  <p>"At that date, you saw the place for the first time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;of course."</p>

  <p>Charlie nodded. "With regard to this evening, I can also omit to ask from
  you your exact location at two minutes past eight."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. I was with you and these other chaps at the hotel. As I
  believe I told you, when I left you just after eight o'clock, I went with Mr.
  Jaynes on to the terrace. I tried to calm him a bit, but he broke away and
  wandered down the beach. I sat there on the beach walk for some twenty-five
  minutes, admiring the set. When I saw you again, I had just been upstairs to
  get my hat, intending to come down here."</p>

  <p>Charlie looked over at Alan Jaynes, nervously smoking his small cigar in a
  distant corner. "Mr. Jaynes," he said.</p>

  <p>The Britisher rose and approached him, consulting his watch as he did so.
  "Yes?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>Charlie regarded him gravely. "You are, I believe, one of the people who
  suffer most from this death to-night?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"It is reported that you loved Shelah Fane."</p>

  <p>"Reported&mdash;by whom?" The man looked angrily at Tarneverro.</p>

  <p>"No matter," said Chan. "You had asked her to marry you?"</p>

  <p>"I had."</p>

  <p>"Then you loved her?"</p>

  <p>"Look here&mdash;must you make a public inquisition of this?"</p>

  <p>"So sorry. It is, I perceive, somewhat indiscreet on my part. Mr. Bradshaw
  has told me you were in this room at seven-forty to-night."</p>

  <p>"I was. I had come to dinner."</p>

  <p>"And to have, first of all, a private conversation with Miss Fane?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But the nature of that conversation is none of your business."</p>

  <p>Charlie smiled. "Alas! I know so much that is none of my business. You ask
  for her final decision in the matter of marriage. She rejects you, and you
  suspect Mr. Tarneverro here is responsible for the action. You tramp angrily
  back to hotel, seeking to make quarrel with this same Tarneverro. So, at two
  minutes past eight, you stand in hotel lounge, glowering. Which, dear sir, is
  fortunate affair for you."</p>

  <p>"I take it," Jaynes said, "that you have fixed the moment of
  this&mdash;this murder, at two minutes after eight?"</p>

  <p>"I have," Chan replied.</p>

  <p>Jaynes tossed his cigar into an ash-tray with a gesture of deep relief.
  "Thank God for that. Have you any more questions?"</p>

  <p>"You saw Miss Fane for final time when you left this room at about fifteen
  minutes before eight?"</p>

  <p>"That was the last time I saw her&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"Then you did not return here between eight-five and
  eight-thirty-five?"</p>

  <p>"I did not."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been in Hollywood, Mr. Jaynes?"</p>

  <p>The Britisher laughed bitterly. "I have not&mdash;and I'm not likely to go
  there."</p>

  <p>"That is all, sir," Chan nodded.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I'll say good-by. I happen to be sailing on the Oceanic at
  midnight."</p>

  <p>Charlie looked at him in sudden surprise. "You are leaving Hawaii
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>The detective shrugged. "I am so sorry to disappoint you. The matter is
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"Why should it be?" Jaynes demanded.</p>

  <p>"You are somewhat deeply involved in this affair."</p>

  <p>"But you say you've fixed the moment of the murder&mdash;and at that
  moment I was standing in your presence. It's a perfect alibi."</p>

  <p>"Perfect alibis have way of turning imperfect without warning," Charlie
  informed him. "I regret that I can not allow you to sail. The Oceanic will be
  carefully watched, and no one connected with this affair will be permitted to
  leave the island aboard her. Or on any other ship, for the present."</p>

  <p>An angry flush spread over the Britisher's face. "On what grounds do you
  keep me here?"</p>

  <p>"As an important witness in present case," Chan replied. "I will go to
  extreme length of swearing out warrant, if necessary."</p>

  <p>"I can at least go back to the hotel," Jaynes suggested.</p>

  <p>"When I permit it," Charlie said gently. "Meanwhile, I hope you will find
  for yourself a comfortable chair."</p>

  <p>Jaynes glared at him, then receded into the background. The door-bell
  rang, and Jessop admitted two men. One was a tall angular American with a
  deputy sheriff's badge, the other a small anxious-looking Japanese.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Coroner," Chan greeted the deputy, who doubled in that role. "And
  Kashimo. As usual, Kashimo, you are demon for speed to get on job. Is it too
  much to assume that you arrive here with horse and carriage?"</p>

  <p>The deputy spoke. "They sent him to fetch me, and he finally managed it.
  Where did this thing happen, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"In a moment I lead you to the place," Charlie said.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I search house," suggested Kashimo.</p>

  <p>Chan regarded him sadly. "It would appear that there was great shortage of
  detectives at station house tonight," he said. "No, Mr. Kashimo, please do
  not search house&mdash;at least, not until somebody tells you what you are
  searching for." He turned to the deputy. "If you will follow me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Diana Dixon came into the room. She wore a white evening gown, and her
  elaborate make-up was sufficient explanation of the long delay in her
  appearance. Chan looked at her with interest.</p>

  <p>"Here is some one about whom I have not heard before," he said.</p>

  <p>"Who in the world&mdash;" began Diana, staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Do not be alarmed," smiled Charlie. "I am Inspector Chan, of Honolulu
  police. You are in Hawaii now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Your name, please?"</p>

  <p>She gave it.</p>

  <p>"You are guest in house, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"I am. Miss Fane was kind enough to take me in. You know, I've just come
  up from the South Seas with her&mdash;I acted in her last picture."</p>

  <p>"An actress," nodded Chan. "I find myself dazzled by so much fame and
  beauty. All the same, I collect myself to inquire&mdash;what have you been
  engaged in doing this evening?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I've been in swimming," she told him.</p>

  <p>"When did you last see Miss Fane?"</p>

  <p>"When I went up-stairs to put on my bathing-suit&mdash;I don't know what
  time that was. Mr. Bradshaw had just come, and Miss Julie and he and I went
  up to change. We left Miss Fane standing here in the hall. Some one was
  ringing the door-bell."</p>

  <p>"You came down and entered the water with these young people?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;it took me a lot longer to change. It was eight o'clock when
  I was finally ready&mdash;I noticed the clock on my dressing-table just
  before I left my room. I'd no idea it was so late&mdash;so I hurried
  down&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You did not see Miss Fane?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. This room was empty when I came through it. I crossed the
  lanai and stepped out on the lawn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At a little time past eight?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it must have been three or four minutes past the hour. As I ran
  over the lawn, I saw a man come hurriedly away from the pavilion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You saw a man leaving the pavilion? Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I couldn't see his face. I thought he was one of the
  guests, and I shouted hello. But he didn't answer."</p>

  <p>"You are able to describe him?" Chan asked.</p>

  <p>"Not his face&mdash;that was in shadow, as I told you. But he was wearing
  a coat&mdash;an overcoat&mdash;I thought it odd on a night like this. The
  coat was open, and a streak of light from the kitchen window fell on his
  shirt-front. He was dressed in evening clothes, you see, and across his white
  shirt&mdash;" Suddenly she turned pale and sat down weakly in the nearest
  chair. "Oh, my God," she cried, "I never thought of it before."</p>

  <p>"You never thought of what before?" Charlie prompted.</p>

  <p>"That stain on his shirt&mdash;that long, narrow, bright red stain," she
  gasped. "It&mdash;it must have been blood."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">VI. &mdash; FIREWORKS IN THE RAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a moment, stunned by the picture Miss Dixon's words
  presented, the assemblage was silent. Then a low murmur, a buzz of amazed
  comment, filled the room. Charlie Chan stood looking at his newest witness
  speculatively, as though he asked himself whether her statement could
  possibly be true.</p>

  <p>"Most interesting," he said at last. "There has been, then, on these
  grounds to-night, a gentleman whose presence was up to this moment
  unsuspected by me. Whether or not he carried blood-soaked shirt
  bosom&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I tell you I saw it," the girl protested.</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "Perhaps. Oh, most humble pardon&mdash;I do not question
  your truth. I merely mention overwrought nerves, or maybe optic illusion. You
  must excuse if I say I might admit murderer would be so clumsy at his work as
  to inundate himself, but reason totters on pedestal to add that such a man
  would rush from scene of crime with coat flapping open on his error. Rather I
  would picture him with garment wrapped close to hide away this crimson
  evidence. But what does it matter? We must at any rate pursue thought of man
  with overcoat. The idea in itself presents portrait of queer human being.
  Overcoat in smiling tropics, even over evening dress, is unaccustomed garb."
  He turned to Julie. "And what, please, is name of man servant in this
  house?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Jessop?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"I mean the butler. Will you summon him&mdash;if I am not getting too
  obnoxious?"</p>

  <p>Julie went into the hall, and Charlie turned to the deputy sheriff. "I
  find it impossible to accompany you to scene of crime just yet. Same took
  place in small beach house at right of lawn&mdash;please accept this key. You
  may begin examination, and I will join you when I have interrogated servants
  here."</p>

  <p>"Did you find the weapon, Charlie?" asked the coroner.</p>

  <p>"I did not. That was, I think, carried off by the assailant. He was
  person, you will find, who had wits in good control." Charlie turned to the
  Japanese. "Kashimo, you may enjoy yourself by keen observation of the
  neighborhood. But if you repeat one former performance and spoil any
  footprints for me, I will at once arrange for you to return to former
  position as janitor of fish market."</p>

  <p>The coroner and the little Japanese went out. At the same moment Jessop
  held open the curtains and followed Julie into the room. The butler was pale
  and agitated.</p>

  <p>"The name is Jessop?" Charlie inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;ah&mdash;sir."</p>

  <p>"You understand who it is that I am?"</p>

  <p>"I take it you represent the local constabulary, sir."</p>

  <p>Chan grinned. "If it will help you to endure society of person like me,
  Jessop, I offer statement that my humble efforts on one occasion met with the
  complete approval of a gentleman from Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"Really, sir?" answered Jessop. "The memory must be most gratifying to
  you."</p>

  <p>"It is, indeed. How long is it now that you have been Miss Fane's
  butler?"</p>

  <p>"Two years, sir."</p>

  <p>"You were in Hollywood before that, maybe?"</p>

  <p>"For about eighteen months, I was."</p>

  <p>"A butler, always?"</p>

  <p>"Always a butler, sir. I had a number of berths before I went with Miss
  Fane. I am bound to say that I was unhappily in all of them."</p>

  <p>"The work was, perhaps, too difficult?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all, sir. I objected to the familiarity of my employers. There is
  a certain reserve that should exist between servant and master. I found that
  lacking. The ladies I worked for would often weep in my presence and tell me
  stories of unrequited love. The gentlemen who engaged me were inclined to
  treat me like some long-lost brother. One in particular was accustomed to
  address me as 'old pal' and when a bit under the influence, would embrace me
  in the presence of guests. A man has his dignity, sir."</p>

  <p>"It has been well said, without dignity there can be no stature," Charlie
  assured him. "You found Miss Fane of a different type?"</p>

  <p>"I did indeed, sir. A lady who knew her place as I knew mine. There was
  never any undue informality in her treatment of me."</p>

  <p>"Relations were, then, of the happiest?"</p>

  <p>"That they were. I should like to add that I am quite heart-broken by this
  evening's business, sir."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;coming to this evening&mdash;did any of the gentlemen whom
  you admitted here to-night wear an overcoat, Jessop?"</p>

  <p>"An overcoat, sir?" Jessop's white eyebrows went up.</p>

  <p>"Yes. With dinner costume, you understand."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," replied Jessop firmly. "No such gaucherie of dress was evident,
  Constable."</p>

  <p>Chan smiled. "Kindly look about the room. Do you recall admitting any
  visitor with exception of those now visible to your view?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," returned Jessop, surveying the party.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. When did you last see Miss Fane?"</p>

  <p>"It was in this room, at about twenty minutes after seven, when I brought
  her a box of flowers. I heard her voice after that, but I did not see
  her."</p>

  <p>"Please detail your activities from hour of twenty minutes past seven
  onward," Chan requested.</p>

  <p>"I was engaged with my duties, sir, in the dining-room and the kitchen. I
  may add that it has been a rather trying evening, in my department. The
  Chinese cook has exhibited all the worst qualities of a heathen
  race&mdash;I'm sure I beg your pardon."</p>

  <p>"A heathen race," repeated Charlie gravely, "that was busy inventing the
  art of printing at moment when gentlemen in Great Britain were still beating
  one another over head with spiked clubs. Pray excuse this brief reference to
  history. The cook has been in uproar?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Constable. He has proved himself sorely deficient in that patience
  for which his people have long been noted. Then, too, the&mdash;er&mdash;the
  bootlegger, to use one of your&mdash;or their&mdash;American phrases, has
  been unforgivably late."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;you already possess bootlegger?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Miss Fane was a temperate woman herself, but she knew her
  duties as a hostess. So Wu Kno-ching, the cook, arranged with a friend to
  deliver a bit of liquor just out of the laboratory, and a wine of the most
  recent vintage."</p>

  <p>"I am deeply shocked," Chan replied. "Wu's friend was late?"</p>

  <p>"He was indeed, sir. As I say, I was busy with my duties from the moment I
  gave Miss Fane the flowers. At two minutes past eight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why do you make selection of two minutes past eight?"</p>

  <p>"I could not help but overhear your questions to these others, sir. At
  that moment I was in the kitchen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Wu was there, of course. And Anna, the maid, had dropped in for
  a cup of tea to sustain her until dinner. I called Wu's attention to the fact
  that it was already past eight o'clock, and we had a few words about the
  bootlegger's tardiness. The three of us remained there together until ten
  after eight, when Wu's friend made a rather sheepish appearance, and I
  immediately set about to do what I could with the ingredients he brought. At
  fifteen past eight, I came out to admit Mr. Van Horn. From that point on I
  was in and out of this room, sir, but I did not leave the house until I went
  to the beach and sounded the dinner gong."</p>

  <p>"I am obliged to you for a most complete account," Charlie nodded. "That
  is all, Jessop."</p>

  <p>The butler hesitated. "There is one other matter, Constable."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes. What is that?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know whether or not it has any significance, sir, but it came
  back to me when I heard this terrible news. There is a small library
  up-stairs, and to-day, when I had cleared away the luncheon things, I went in
  there to secure a book, planning to take it to my room as a recreation during
  my siesta. I came suddenly upon Miss Fane. She was looking at a photograph
  and weeping most bitterly, sir."</p>

  <p>"A photograph of whom?"</p>

  <p>"That I couldn't say, sir, save that it was of some gentleman. She held it
  so I could not obtain a better view of the face, and hurriedly left the room.
  All I can tell you is that it was a rather large photograph, and was mounted
  on a mat that was Nile green in color."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "Thank you so much. Will you be kind enough to dispatch
  heathen cook into my presence, Jessop?"</p>

  <p>"I will indeed, sir," replied Jessop, and withdrew.</p>

  <p>Charlie looked about the circle. "The matter lengthens itself out," he
  remarked kindly. "I observe beyond windows a cool lanai crowded with nice
  Hongkong chairs. Any who wish to do so may stroll to more airy perch. One
  thing only I ask&mdash;please do not leave these grounds."</p>

  <p>There followed a general movement and amid a low buzz of comment all save
  Bradshaw, Julie, Tarneverro and Chan went out on the dim lanai. The
  fortune-teller looked keenly at Charlie.</p>

  <p>"What have you accomplished?" he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>Charlie shrugged. "Up to the present moment, I seem to have been setting
  off fireworks in the rain."</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what I thought," Tarneverro said impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Do not lose heart&mdash;" Chan advised. "Changing the figure, I might add
  that to dig up the tree, we must start with the root. All this digging is
  routine matter that does not fascinate, but at any moment we may strike a
  root of vital importance."</p>

  <p>"I sincerely hope so," Tarneverro remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you trust Charlie," Bradshaw said. "One of Honolulu's first citizens,
  he is. He'll get his man."</p>

  <p>Wu Kno-ching came in, mumbling to himself, and Charlie addressed him
  sharply in Cantonese. Looking at him with sleepy eyes, Wu replied at some
  length.</p>

  <p>The high-pitched, singsong exchange of words between these two
  representatives of the oldest civilized nation in the world grew faster and
  louder, and on Wu's part, seemingly more impassioned. The three outsiders
  stood there deeply interested; it was like a play in some dead language; they
  could not understand the lines but they were conscious of a strong current of
  drama underneath. Once Chan, who had up to that point been seemingly
  uninterested, lifted his head like a bird-dog on the scent. He went closer to
  the old man, and seized his arm. One recognizable word in Wu's conversation
  occurred again and again. He mentioned the "bootleggah."</p>

  <p>Finally, with a shrug, Chan turned away.</p>

  <p>"What's he say, Charlie?" asked Bradshaw eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He knows nothing," Chan answered.</p>

  <p>"What was all that about the bootlegger?"</p>

  <p>Charlie gave the boy a keen look. "The tongue of age speaks with
  accumulated wisdom, and is heard gladly, but the tongue of youth should save
  its strength," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yours received and contents noted," smiled the boy.</p>

  <p>Chan turned to Julie. "You have spoken of Miss Fane's maid. She alone
  remains to be interviewed. Will you be so good as to produce her?"</p>

  <p>Julie nodded and went out. Wu Kno-ching still lingered at the door, and
  now he burst into a tirade, with appropriate gestures. Charlie listened for a
  moment, and then shooed the old man from the room.</p>

  <p>"Wu complains that no one eats his dinner," he smiled. "He is great artist
  who lacks appreciation, and his ancient heart cracks with rage."</p>

  <p>"Well," remarked Jimmy Bradshaw, "I suppose it's an unfeeling thing to
  say, but I could put away a little of his handiwork."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "I have thought of that. Later, perhaps. Why not? Do the dead
  gain if the living starve?"</p>

  <p>Julie returned, followed by Anna, the maid. The latter was a dark thin
  woman who moved gracefully.</p>

  <p>"The name, please?" Chan inquired.</p>

  <p>"Anna Rodderick," she answered. There was just a trace of defiance in her
  tone.</p>

  <p>"You have been with Miss Shelah Fane how long?"</p>

  <p>"Something like a year and a half, sir."</p>

  <p>"I see. Before that you were perhaps employed elsewhere in Hollywood?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I was not. I went with Miss Fane the day after my arrival there,
  and I have never been employed by any one else in the picture colony."</p>

  <p>"How did you happen to go to California, please?"</p>

  <p>"I was in service in England, and a friend wrote me of the higher wages
  that prevailed in the States."</p>

  <p>"Your relations with Miss Fane&mdash;they were pleasant?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, sir, or I wouldn't have remained with her. There were many
  other positions available."</p>

  <p>"Did she ever admit you into her confidence regarding personal
  affairs?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, she did not. It was one of the things I liked about her."</p>

  <p>"When did you last see your mistress?"</p>

  <p>"At a bit before seven-thirty. I was about to go down to the kitchen for a
  cup of tea, for I saw that my dinner was likely to be long delayed. Miss Fane
  came to her room&mdash;I was in the one adjoining. She called to me and said
  she wanted a pin for some orchids she had in her hand. I went and got it for
  her."</p>

  <p>"Kindly describe the pin."</p>

  <p>"It was a rather delicate affair, set with diamonds. About two inches
  long, I should say. I fastened the flowers to the shoulder-strap of her
  gown."</p>

  <p>"Did she remark about those flowers?" Charlie inquired.</p>

  <p>"She said they were sent to her by some one of whom she was once very
  fond. She seemed a bit excited."</p>

  <p>"What happened next?"</p>

  <p>"She sat down at the telephone," Anna told him. "There is an extension in
  her room. She looked up a number in the telephone book and then busied
  herself with the dial, sir."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you heard subsequent conversation?" Chan suggested.</p>

  <p>"I am not accustomed to spying, sir. I left her at once and went down to
  the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"You were in the kitchen at two minutes past eight?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I recall the hour because there was a great deal of talk
  between Jessop and the cook about the bootlegger."</p>

  <p>"You were still in the kitchen when this bootlegger came, at ten minutes
  past eight?"</p>

  <p>"I was, sir. A little later I went back to my room."</p>

  <p>"You did not see your mistress again?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I did not."</p>

  <p>"One other thing." Chan looked at her thoughtfully. "Kindly speak of her
  manner during the day. Was it same as always?"</p>

  <p>"I noticed nothing unusual."</p>

  <p>"You did not note that she was seen with a portrait&mdash;the portrait of
  a gentleman&mdash;during the afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"I was not here this afternoon. It was our first day ashore, and Miss Fane
  kindly gave me a few hours off."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen, among Miss Fane's possessions, portrait of gentleman
  mounted on Nile-green mat?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Fane always carried with her a large portfolio, containing many
  pictures of her friends. It may be such a one is among them."</p>

  <p>"But you never saw it?"</p>

  <p>"I have never opened the portfolio. That would seem too much like
  prying&mdash;if I may say so, sir."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where portfolio is now?" Charlie asked.</p>

  <p>"I believe it is lying on a table in her room. Shall I fetch it for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"A little later, perhaps. Just now I would inquire&mdash;you are familiar
  with jewelry usually worn by Miss Fane on occasion of evening party? Aside
  from diamond pin fastening orchids, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, sir."</p>

  <p>"Will you come with me, please?"</p>

  <p>Leaving the others in the drawing-room, he led the maid across the moonlit
  lawn in the direction of the pavilion. They went in, and Anna lost her
  composure for a moment at sight of Shelah Fane. She gave a strangled little
  cry.</p>

  <p>"Kindly conduct thorough search," Chan said to her, "and inform me if all
  jewelry is at present time in place."</p>

  <p>Anna nodded without speaking. The coroner came over to greet Chan.</p>

  <p>"I've made my examination," he said. "This is a pretty big thing, Charlie.
  I'd better send somebody to help you out."</p>

  <p>Chan smiled. "I have Kashimo," he answered. "What more could any man ask?
  Tell Chief I will report entire matter to him at earliest convenience." They
  stepped out on the lanai of the pavilion, and at the same moment Kashimo
  crept like a correspondence-school sleuth from a cluster of bushes at the
  corner of the building.</p>

  <p>"Charlie&mdash;come quick," he whispered hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Kashimo has discovered essential clue," Charlie said. "Please join us,
  Mr. Coroner."</p>

  <p>They followed the Japanese through the bushes and out upon a public beach
  that bounded the property on the right. On that side of the pavilion, which
  stood flush with the dividing line, was a single window. Kashimo led them to
  this, and swept a flash-light over the sand.</p>

  <p>"Footprints-s-s!" he hissed dramatically.</p>

  <p>Charlie seized the light and knelt on the sand. "True enough, Kashimo," he
  remarked. "These are footprints, and peculiar ones, too. Shoes were old and
  battered, the heels are worn down unevenly, and in sole of one shoe was most
  unfashionable hole." He stood up. "I fear that fortune has not been smiling
  on owner of that footwear," he added.</p>

  <p>"I am one to find things," remarked Kashimo proudly.</p>

  <p>"You are," smiled Charlie, "and for once you do not destroy clue the
  moment you come upon it. You are learning, Kashimo. Warm
  congratulations."</p>

  <p>They returned to the lawn of Shelah Fane's house. "Well, Charlie, this is
  up to you," the deputy said. "I'll see you early in the morning&mdash;unless
  you want me to stay."</p>

  <p>"Your duty is accomplished," Chan answered, "Or will be when you have made
  proper arrangements in city. Body will of course be taken at once to
  mortuary."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the deputy replied. "Well, good-by&mdash;and good luck."</p>

  <p>Chan turned to Kashimo. "Now great opportunity arises for you to perform
  your specialty," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes-s-s," Kashimo answered eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Go to house, inquire for bedroom of Miss Shelah Fane, and
  search&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I go now," cried Kashimo, leaping away.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" commanded Charlie. "You are one grand apprentice detective,
  Kashimo, but you never pause to inquire what it is you sleuth for. On table
  of that room you will find large portfolio of photographs. I very much desire
  to see portrait of gentleman mounted on mat that is colored Nile
  green&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nile is new word to me," the Japanese complained.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and I have no time for geography lesson now," sighed Chan.
  "Bring me all photographs in room mounted on cardboard colored green. If none
  such is in portfolio, search elsewhere. Now be off. The portrait of a
  gentleman, remember. If you return with pretty picture of Fujiyama I will
  personally escort you back to private life."</p>

  <p>Kashimo sped across the lawn, and Charlie again entered the pavilion. Anna
  was standing in the center of the room.</p>

  <p>"You made investigation?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I did," she said. "The pin that fastened the flowers is nowhere
  about."</p>

  <p>"A matter already known to me," he nodded. "Otherwise the ornamental
  equipment is complete?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "It isn't."</p>

  <p>He regarded her with sudden interest. "Something is missing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;an emerald ring&mdash;a large emerald that Miss Fane usually
  wore on her right hand. She told me once that it represented quite a bit of
  money. And&mdash;it has disappeared."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">VII. &mdash; THE ALIBI OF THE WATCH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Charlie sent the maid back to the house, and then sat down
  in the straight-backed chair before the dressing-table. The sole illumination
  in the little room came from two pink-shaded lamps, one on either side of the
  mirror. Thoughtfully he stared into the glass where, dimly reflected, he
  caught occasional glimpses of an ivory satin gown. Shelah Fane now lay on the
  couch where the coroner had placed her. All the loves and the hates, the
  jealousies, the glittering triumphs of this tempestuous career were ended
  to-night. A woman of flame, they had called her. The flame had flickered and
  died like a candle in the wind&mdash;in the restless trade-wind blowing from
  the Koolau Range.</p>

  <p>Chan's small eyes narrowed in an intense effort at concentration. In one
  of her more indiscreet moments, Shelah Fane had seen Denny Mayo murdered. For
  three years she had carried the secret about with her until&mdash;and this
  moment was even more indiscreet&mdash;she poured it into the willing ears of
  Tarneverro the Great, a crystal-gazer&mdash;a charlatan, no doubt. That same
  night, the black camel had knelt before her gate.</p>

  <p>Carefully in his mind, the detective began to go over the points his
  investigation had so far revealed. He was not one to carry a note-book, but
  he took an envelope from his pocket, and with a pencil began to write a list
  of names on the back. He was thus engaged when he heard a step behind him.
  Looking over his shoulder, he saw the lean mysterious figure of
  Tarneverro.</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller came forward and dropped into a chair at Chan's side.
  He stared at the detective, and there was disapproval in that stare.</p>

  <p>"Since you have asked me to work with you in this affair," he began, "you
  will perhaps pardon me if I say I think you have been extremely
  careless."</p>

  <p>Charlie's eyes opened wide. "Yes?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I refer to Miss Fane's letter," continued Tarneverro. "It may have been
  the answer to all our questions. In it the poor girl may have written the
  name we so eagerly seek. Yet you made no move to search the people in that
  room&mdash;you even pooh-poohed the idea when I offered it. Why?"</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "You think, then, we have to deal with a fool? A miscreant
  who would take pretty complete pains to obtain the epistle, and then place it
  on his own person where a search would instantly reveal it? You are wrong, my
  friend. I had no taste for revealing how wrong you were, at the expense of
  further embarrassment for myself. No, the letter is hidden in that room, and
  sooner or later it will be found. If not&mdash;what of it? I have strong
  feeling that it contains nothing of the least importance."</p>

  <p>"On what do you base that feeling?" Tarneverro inquired.</p>

  <p>"I have plenty as a base. Would Shelah Fane have written big secret down
  and then given it to servant who must pass it along to you? No, she would
  have awaited her opportunity and then delivered it to you with her own hand.
  I do not reprove you, but I believe you attach undue importance to that
  probably innocent epistle."</p>

  <p>"Well, the murderer certainly thought it important. You can't deny
  that."</p>

  <p>"Murderer was in state of high excitement and took unnecessary risk. If he
  takes few more like that, we are at trail's end."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro, with a gesture, dismissed the matter. "Well, and what have you
  discovered from all your questions?" He glanced at Chan's notes.</p>

  <p>"Not much. You perceived that I was curious to learn who was in Hollywood
  three years ago last month. Assuming that the story is true&mdash;the story
  you say Shelah Fane told you this morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't it be true? Does a woman make a confession like that as a
  joke?"</p>

  <p>"Never," answered Chan, somewhat sharply for him. "And for that reason I
  am remarking I assume it to be true. It is, then, important to locate our
  many suspects in June three years ago. I have written here the names of all
  who were in Hollywood at that time, and consequently may have slain Denny
  Mayo. They are Wilkie Ballou, Rita his wife, Huntley Van Horn. And&mdash;ah,
  yes&mdash;Jessop, the butler. I regret that, overwhelmed by account of bloody
  shirt, I neglected to make inquiries of Miss Dixon."</p>

  <p>"She has been in Hollywood six years," the fortune-teller informed him. "I
  know from what she has told me during the readings I have given her."</p>

  <p>"One more." Charlie wrote down the name. "I may, I presume, add Miss
  Julie&mdash;though very young at the time. Of these, for the hour of two
  minutes past eight to-night, two have been accounted for. Jessop presents
  plenty good alibi and Huntley Van Horn has perfect one, to which I myself can
  swear. Other things I learned&mdash;not very important&mdash;but it struck my
  mind, as it must have struck yours, that Mr. Alan Jaynes was breathless with
  anxiety to leave Hawaii to-night. Do not forget&mdash;it is within bounds of
  possibility that Denny Mayo murder had nothing to do with death of Shelah
  Fane. This Jaynes was in overwrought state; his may be fiercely jealous
  nature; he may have looked at those orchids, the gift of another, on the
  lady's shoulder, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he, too, has the alibi of the watch," Tarneverro suggested.</p>

  <p>"Alas! yes," Chan nodded.</p>

  <p>For a moment they sat in silence. Then Tarneverro rose, and walked slowly
  toward the couch. "By the way," he said casually, "have you made a thorough
  examination of this watch?"</p>

  <p>"So sorry." Chan rose and followed him. "You now call my attention to fact
  that I have neglected most obvious duty." Tarneverro was bending over, but
  Chan stopped him. "I will remove it at once and have careful look at
  it&mdash;though I am so dense I do not quite grasp your meaning."</p>

  <p>Taking a linen handkerchief from his pocket, he spread it over his left
  hand. With his other hand he unfastened the narrow black ribbon from Shelah
  Fane's wrist, and lifting the costly little watch, laid it on the
  handkerchief. He went back and stood directly under one of the lights,
  staring down at the timepiece.</p>

  <p>"Haie, I seem in stupid mood to-night," he sighed. "I am still at sea.
  Crystal is broken, watch has ceased to function at precisely two minutes past
  eight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Permit me," said Tarneverro. "I will be more explicit." He took both
  handkerchief and watch, and with the linen always between his fingers and the
  metal, turned the stem of the fragile timepiece. At his touch, the minute
  hand moved instantly.</p>

  <p>A flash of triumph shone in the fortune-teller's eyes. "That," he cried,
  "is more than I dared to hope for. The murderer has been guilty of a small
  error&mdash;it was very kind of him. He adjusted the stem so that the time
  shown on the face of the watch could be altered at will&mdash;and in his
  haste he forgot to readjust it. Surely I needn't tell you what that
  means."</p>

  <p>Charlie gave him a look of enthusiastic approval. "You are detective of
  the first class yourself&mdash;give me credit that I noted same this morning.
  I can never cease to be grateful to you. Of course I grasp meaning now."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro laid the watch down on the glass top of the dressing-table. "I
  think we may be sure of one thing, Inspector," he remarked. "At whatever hour
  the murder took place, it was certainly not at two minutes past eight. We are
  dealing with a clever man. After he had killed Shelah Fane he removed her
  watch, set the time back&mdash;or perhaps forward&mdash;to two minutes past
  eight, and then smashed the thing as though to indicate a struggle." The
  fortune-teller's eyes lighted; he pointed to the corner of the
  dressing-table. "That's the explanation of the nick in the glass. He banged
  the watch against that corner until he had stopped its running."</p>

  <p>Chan was instantly on the floor. "There is no glass beneath," he said.</p>

  <p>"No, no," Tarneverro continued. "There wouldn't be. The broken glass was
  naturally found where Miss Fane fell. And why? Because this unknown person
  removed the watch with a handkerchief, as you have done; he swung it against
  the table in that handkerchief to catch the bits of crystal, and carried the
  wrecked remains intact to the spot where he wanted them. A bright boy,
  Inspector."</p>

  <p>Charlie nodded. Obvious chagrin was in his manner. "But you are brighter
  boy. Almost I am on verge of resigning in disgust at my own stupidity. You
  should take my badge, Mr. Tarneverro, for you are the smart detective on this
  case."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro gave him an odd look. "You think so, do you? I'm afraid you
  exaggerate&mdash;the matter was really simple enough. It came into my mind
  that too many of us had alibis in this affair. I thought how easy it would be
  to change the time on the face of a watch. That is what happened here. The
  murderer set it at a moment then past, for which he had already established
  an alibi&mdash;or at a future time for which he proposed to get an alibi
  forthwith. However, when a man is excited he is likely to slip up
  somewhere&mdash;and this chap stumbled when he forgot to push down that
  little stem before he left."</p>

  <p>Chan sighed. "I am, as I remarked, bubbling with gratitude toward you, and
  yet I am appalled. Whole flock of alibis is now quite ruined, and the field
  broadens like some boundless prairie. Van Horn's alibi is gone, the alibis of
  Martino and of Jaynes, they are gone too, and&mdash;begging humble pardon,
  Mr. Tarneverro&mdash;you have likewise destroyed the alibi you yourself
  possessed."</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller threw back his head and laughed. "Do I need an alibi?"
  he cried.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," Charlie grinned. "But when a tree falls the shade is gone.
  Who knows? Even you might regret the loss of that shade in time."</p>

  <p>"It may happen that I have another tree," suggested Tarneverro.</p>

  <p>"If that is true, I congratulate you." Charlie glanced around the room. "I
  must have poor unfortunate lady removed now to house, then lock this place
  until finger-print expert can do work early in morning. You will observe we
  do not move with vast speed here in Hawaii. It is our lovely climate." He put
  the watch in the dressing-table drawer, and he and Tarneverro went out, Chan
  again locking the door. "We will now continue to living-room, which we will
  seek to obtain to ourselves. Perhaps there you will deign to keep on with
  remarkable research. I travel in luck to-night. What could I do without
  you?"</p>

  <p>A little group of chairs on the lawn indicated the whereabouts of most of
  the guests. In the living-room they came upon Julie and Jimmy Bradshaw,
  seated close together. The girl had evidently been crying, and Mr. Bradshaw's
  manner suggested that he played the role of comforter. Chan gave Julie the
  key to the pavilion, and told her gently what must be done. She and the boy
  went out to seek the aid of the servants.</p>

  <p>When they had gone, Charlie walked thoughtfully up and down the big room.
  He peered into receptacles that held flowers and plants, opened the few books
  he came upon and ruffled the pages.</p>

  <p>"By the way," Tarneverro remarked, "have you made an inspection of Miss
  Fane's bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Chan answered. "So much to do, and only you and I to do it. I
  have sent Kashimo, our Japanese sleuth hound, on an errand, from which he
  will doubtless return in course of week or two. As for myself&mdash;" He was
  walking across a rug, and paused. "As for myself&mdash;" he repeated. He
  rubbed his thin-soled shoe back and forth over a spot in the rug. "As for
  myself," he added a third time, "I have plenty good business here."</p>

  <p>He stooped and threw back the rug. There on the polished floor lay the big
  envelope that had been snatched from his hand earlier in the evening. One
  corner was missing, but otherwise the letter was intact.</p>

  <p>"Fortunate that Miss Fane preferred such thick note-paper," Charlie said.
  He picked up the envelope. "I fear I can not offer my unknown friend warm
  congratulations on his originality this time. But he was very hurried
  gentleman when this matter engaged his attention&mdash;I must remember
  that."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro came close, his dark eyes gleaming. "By gad&mdash;Shelah's
  letter. And addressed to me, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"I remind you again that the police are in charge," Chan said.</p>

  <p>"They were in charge before," Tarneverro answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes. But history will not repeat just yet." Charlie removed the note
  from the envelope, and read. He shrugged his shoulders, and passed the
  missive to the fortune-teller. "Once I was right," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Tarneverro looked down at the huge sprawling handwriting of one who was
  generous of note-paper as of all things. He frowned at what he saw.</p>

  <p>"Dear Tarneverro:</p>

  <p>"Please forget what I told you this morning. I must have been
  mad&mdash;mad. I intend to forget it&mdash;and so must you&mdash;oh,
  Tarneverro, promise me you will. Pretend that I never said it. I shall refuse
  poor Alan to-night&mdash;it will break my heart&mdash;but I'll do it. I am
  going on alone&mdash;perhaps in the end I may even find a little happiness. I
  want it so much.</p>

  <p>"Yours ever</p>

  <p>"Shelah Fane."</p>

  <p>"Poor Shelah!" The fortune-teller stood for a moment, staring at the
  letter. "She hadn't the courage to go through with it&mdash;I might have
  known. A pitiful letter&mdash;I don't believe I would have insisted, after
  all." He crushed the paper in his hand fiercely. "The murderer of Denny Mayo
  was safe&mdash;she wasn't going to tell on him&mdash;he killed her for
  nothing. She's gone, and she might be here. By heaven&mdash;I'll get him if
  it's the last act of my life!"</p>

  <p>Chan smiled. "I have a similar ambition, though I trust the accomplishment
  will not finish off my existence." His Japanese assistant came stealthily
  into the room. "Ah, Kashimo, have you enjoyed pleasant week-end upstair?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty hard job, but I got him," Kashimo announced proudly. "Found in jar
  under potted plant."</p>

  <p>Chan reached out his hand. To his surprise Kashimo proffered, not the
  photograph Charlie expected, but a handful of torn bits of glazed paper and
  of heavy green cardboard. Some one had ripped the portrait on the green mat
  to bits, and then attempted to conceal the wreckage.</p>

  <p>"What have we now?" Chan said. He stood looking in wonder at the handful
  of scraps that he held. His eyes sought Tarneverro's. "Here is a matter
  worthy of consideration. Person unknown does not wish me to look upon the
  photograph over which Shelah Fane wept this afternoon. Why? Is it then
  portrait of the man you had asked her to betray?"</p>

  <p>"It may have been," Tarneverro agreed.</p>

  <p>"Course now becomes clear," Charlie announced. "I must view this
  photograph, so with all patience at my command, I propose to fit these scraps
  together again." He pulled a small table up before the windows that faced the
  street.</p>

  <p>"I investigate outside the house," Kashimo remarked.</p>

  <p>"Much the safest place to have you," Chan returned. "By all means
  investigate very hard."</p>

  <p>The Japanese went out.</p>

  <p>Charlie removed the table cover, and sat down. On the smooth top he began
  carefully to lay together the pieces of the photograph. The task, he saw, was
  going to be long and arduous. "I never was bright man with jigsaw puzzle," he
  complained. "My daughter Rose was pride of family at that work. I would enjoy
  to have her at my side."</p>

  <p>He had made scant progress when the door of the lanai opened, and a group
  of the guests entered the living-room. Wilkie Ballou walked at the head, and
  after him came Van Horn, Martino, Jaynes and Rita Ballou. Diana Dixon
  followed; she seemed detached from the crowd, which had the air of a
  delegation.</p>

  <p>A delegation it was, evidently. Ballou began to speak, in his most
  commanding tone.</p>

  <p>"See here, Inspector&mdash;we've talked it over and there's no earthly
  reason why you should keep us here any longer. We've all been questioned,
  we've told you what we know, and now we propose to leave."</p>

  <p>Charlie tossed down the as yet unplaced bits of the photograph and rose.
  He bowed politely.</p>

  <p>"I recognize you are impatient with good reason," he said.</p>

  <p>"Then you're willing for us to go along?" inquired Ballou.</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;and I say it with extreme pain&mdash;quite unwilling," Chan
  replied. "Unfortunately, new developments keep popping off like firecrackers
  on New Year holiday, and I have something still to talk about with you."</p>

  <p>"An outrage!" Ballou cried. "I'll have your badge for this."</p>

  <p>Charlie rewarded him with a maddening smile. "That may
  happen&mdash;to-morrow. But looking only at to-night, I am placed in charge
  of this case, and I say&mdash;you will remain here until I tell you to
  depart."</p>

  <p>Jaynes pushed forward. "I have important business on the mainland, and I
  intend to sail at midnight. It is now long past ten. I warn you that you must
  call out your entire force if you propose to keep me here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That also can be done," answered Charlie amiably.</p>

  <p>"Good lord!" The Britisher looked helplessly at Wilkie Ballou. "What kind
  of place is this? Why don't they send a white man out here?"</p>

  <p>A rare light flared suddenly in Charlie's eyes. "The man who is about to
  cross a stream should not revile the crocodile's mother," he said in icy
  tones.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" Jaynes asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean you are not yet safely on the farther bank."</p>

  <p>"You know damn well I've got an alibi," cried the Britisher angrily.</p>

  <p>Chan's little eyes surveyed him from head to foot. "I am not so sure I
  do," he remarked calmly.</p>

  <p>"You said yourself you had fixed the time of this affair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How sad," cut in Charlie, "that we pass through this life, making so many
  errors as we go. Me, I am stupid blunderer. Your alibi, Mr. Jaynes, has been
  punctured like bubble with a pin."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Jaynes.</p>

  <p>Van Horn and Martino stirred with sudden interest.</p>

  <p>"Back off and cool down," Chan continued. "And accepting my advice, speak
  no more of alibis. You have already said too much."</p>

  <p>Like a man dazed, Jaynes almost literally obeyed Chan's orders. Charlie
  turned to Rita Ballou.</p>

  <p>"Madam, my humblest apologies and regrets. I hold you here with the utmost
  grief. It has occurred to me that there is a dinner long prepared&mdash;I
  fear the passage of time has wrecked most of it now. But if I might
  suggest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't eat a thing," Rita told him.</p>

  <p>"No, of course, the very thought is horrifying," Chan nodded. "Such
  heartlessness would be quite out of place." Julie and Bradshaw came in.
  "Nevertheless I urge that you all go out to your positions at the table and
  at least partake of one cup of coffee. The event will shatter strain, and
  make easier the period of waiting. Coffee, as you know, stimulates and
  fortifies the mind."</p>

  <p>"Not a bad idea," said Huntley Van Horn.</p>

  <p>"Miss Julie&mdash;" Chan suggested.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled wanly. "Yes, of course. I'll tell Jessop to get things
  ready. You must forgive me. I'd quite forgotten we had guests to-night."</p>

  <p>She turned and went out. Charlie walked back to the small table where his
  task lay uncompleted. At that instant a French window facing the street was
  thrust suddenly open, and the trade-wind swept into the room like a miniature
  hurricane. Instantly the air was filled with torn bits of photograph,
  swirling about like snow in a Minnesota blizzard.</p>

  <p>Kashimo stuck his head into the room. "S-s-s," he hissed. "Charlie!"</p>

  <p>"Splendid work, Kashimo," said Chan through his teeth. "What is it
  now?"</p>

  <p>"I find window unlocked," announced the Japanese triumphantly, and
  withdrew, closing the aperture behind him.</p>

  <p>Concealing his disgust, Charlie moved around the room, retrieving the bits
  of photograph from most unlikely places. Tarneverro and some of the others
  came promptly to his aid. In a few moments, he again held a little packet of
  scraps in his hand. He walked about, still seeking, but no more were in
  sight.</p>

  <p>He resumed his place at the table, and for a few moments he worked hard.
  Then he shrugged his shoulders, and stood up.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" Tarneverro asked.</p>

  <p>Charlie looked at him. "No use. I have now little more than half the
  pieces I had before." For a moment he stood staring about that
  innocent-appearing little group. It was in his mind to search every one of
  them, but a glance at Ballou reminded him that such action would mean a hot
  battle, and he was ever a man of peace. No, he must reach his goal by some
  other path. He sighed, and placed what he had left of the photograph in his
  pocket, as Kashimo dashed in. More in sorrow than in anger Charlie regarded
  his ambitious confrere.</p>

  <p>"Detectives were practically extinct at station house when they sent you
  out to-night," he said.</p>

  <p>The door-bell rang, a loud, insistent peal. Jessop being in the distant
  kitchen, Jimmy Bradshaw went to the door. Those in the living-room heard a
  few sharp quick words in the hall, and a man strode into their midst. He was
  a handsome fellow of forty, gray at the temples, with great poise of manner
  and a keen eye. The greasepaint of the theater was still on his face. He
  stood, looking about him.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," he said. "I am Robert Fyfe&mdash;at one time the husband
  of Miss Shelah Fane. This is terrible news some one telephoned me a short
  time ago. I came the instant my part in the piece was finished&mdash;without
  stopping to remove my make-up or change my costume. Most
  unprofessional&mdash;but I must ask you to overlook it."</p>

  <p>"Shall I take your overcoat?" Jimmy Bradshaw asked.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much." He stepped to the curtains and handed Jimmy the coat.
  As he turned back toward the room, Diana Dixon's scream rang out, shrill and
  unexpected. She was pointing at Robert Fyfe's shirtfront.</p>

  <p>Diagonally across that white expanse lay the bright red ribbon of the
  Legion of Honor. Startled, Fyfe looked down at it.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," he said. "I came in my stage costume, as I told you. This week,
  you see, I happen to be playing the role of a French ambassador."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE BEACH-COMBER'S SHOES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During the long silence that followed, Charlie stood gravely
  regarding this handsome actor who had, all unknowing, made the best entrance
  of his career. The actor looked back at him with a cool level stare. Still no
  one spoke, and Fyfe began to realize that the gaze of every one in the room
  was upon him. Accustomed though he was to the scrutiny of crowds, he found
  something a bit disconcerting in this situation. He stirred uneasily, and
  sought for words to break the spell.</p>

  <p>"What is all this about Shelah? I came at the earliest possible moment, as
  I say. Though I had not seen her for many years&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How many years?" cried Chan quickly.</p>

  <p>Fyfe looked him over casually. "You must pardon me," he said, "if I do not
  at once grasp your position here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nonchalantly Charlie pushed back the left side of his coat, revealing his
  badge of office. It was a gesture of which an actor could
  approve&mdash;business, not words.</p>

  <p>"I am in charge," Chan said. "You were, you say, at one time husband of
  Miss Shelah Fane. You have not seen her for many years. How many?"</p>

  <p>Fyfe considered. "It was nine years ago, in April, when we parted. We were
  both playing in New York&mdash;Miss Fane in a Ziegfeld revue at the New
  Amsterdam, and I was doing a mystery play at the Astor. She came home one
  night and told me she had a splendid offer to go to Hollywood for a
  picture&mdash;she was so excited, so keen for the idea, that I hadn't the
  heart to oppose her. A week later, on an April evening, I said good-by to her
  at the Grand Central Station, wondering how long I could hold her love. Not
  very long, as it turned out. Within a year she went to Reno, and it was all
  quite painless&mdash;for her, I fancy. Not quite so painless for
  me&mdash;although I had felt it coming, that night at the station. Something
  had told me then that I was seeing her for the last time."</p>

  <p>"You no doubt appeared in Los Angeles in later years," Chan suggested, "at
  moments when Miss Fane was in Hollywood?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;of course. But we never met."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to recall&mdash;were you playing in Los Angeles three years
  ago, in June?"</p>

  <p>Charlie was struck by the look that came into the actor's eyes. Was it,
  perhaps, a look of understanding? "No," said Fyfe firmly. "I was not."</p>

  <p>"You are plenty positive," Chan commented.</p>

  <p>"I happen to be&mdash;yes," Fyfe replied. "Three years ago I was touring
  with a company that did not reach the coast."</p>

  <p>"It is a matter that can easily be verified," the detective reminded him
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," agreed Fyfe. "Go ahead and verify it."</p>

  <p>"Then you assert," Chan continued, "that you have not seen Shelah Fane
  since that moment in New York station, nine years ago?"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"You did not see her in Honolulu to-day?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Or to-night?"</p>

  <p>A pause. "No."</p>

  <p>Julie entered. "The coffee is ready," she announced. "Please, all come
  into the dining-room."</p>

  <p>"I make haste to endorse that suggestion," Chan put in.</p>

  <p>Reluctantly they filed out, assuring one another that they could eat
  nothing, that the idea was unthinkable, but that perhaps a cup of
  coffee&mdash;Their voices trailed away beyond the curtains. Of the dinner
  guests, only the fortune-teller lingered.</p>

  <p>"Please go, Mr. Tarneverro," Chan said. "Small stimulant will increase
  action of that fine brain on which I lean so heavily."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro bowed. "For a moment only," he replied, and left the room.</p>

  <p>Charlie turned to Kashimo. "As for you, I suggest you travel out to lanai,
  sit upon a chair, and think about your sins. When you appeared a moment ago
  like Jack of the box, you scattered precious evidence to the winds."</p>

  <p>"So sorry," Kashimo hissed.</p>

  <p>"Please be sorry on the lanai," Charlie advised, and hurrying him out,
  closed the windows after him. Turning, he came back to Robert Fyfe. "I am
  happy to be alone with you," he began. "Though you may not have guessed, you
  are most interesting figure who has yet popped into this affair."</p>

  <p>"Really?" The actor dropped into a chair and sat there, a striking figure
  in his ambassadorial costume. His manner was calm, unperturbed, and seemingly
  he was in the frankest of moods.</p>

  <p>"Very interesting indeed," Charlie continued. "I gaze at you, and I ask
  myself&mdash;why is he lying to me?"</p>

  <p>Fyfe half rose from his chair. "Look here. What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "My dear sir&mdash;what is the use? When you visit lawn
  pavilions to call on ex-wives, how careless to flaunt distinctive red ribbon
  on chest. It might even be mistaken by excitable young women for&mdash;blood.
  Matter of fact&mdash;it was."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Fyfe grimly. "I see."</p>

  <p>"The truth&mdash;for a change," went on Chan gently.</p>

  <p>The actor sat for a moment with his head in his hands. Finally he looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"Gladly," he answered. "Though the truth is a bit&mdash;unusual. I hadn't
  seen Shelah Fane since that night in the station&mdash;until to-night. This
  morning I heard she was in town. It was quite startling&mdash;what the news
  did to me. You did not know Miss Fane, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Inspector Chan," Charlie informed him. "No, I had not the pleasure."</p>

  <p>"It was really that&mdash;a pleasure." Fyfe half smiled. "She was a
  remarkable girl, aflame with life. I'd once been very fond of her and&mdash;I
  never got over it. No other woman ever meant anything to me after Shelah
  left. I couldn't hold her&mdash;I don't blame her for that&mdash;no man could
  hold her long. She wanted romance, excitement. Well, as I say, I learned this
  morning she was in town, and the news thrilled me&mdash;it was as though I
  heard her voice again after nine years' silence. I sent her flowers, with a
  message&mdash;love from some one you have forgotten. Have I said she was
  impetuous? Wild, unreasoning, sudden&mdash;and irresistible. My flowers had
  barely reached this house when she called me on the telephone. She caught me
  at the theater, made up, ready to go on. 'Bob,' she said, 'you must come at
  once. You must. I want so much to see you. I am waiting.'"</p>

  <p>He glanced at Chan, and shrugged. "Any other woman, and I would have
  answered: 'After the show.' Somehow, that was never the way one replied to
  Shelah. 'Coming'&mdash;that was always the answer when Shelah spoke.</p>

  <p>"It was a rather mad idea, but possible. I had arrived at the theater
  early, I needn't go on for forty-five minutes. I had a car and could drive
  out here, if I rushed it a bit, in fifteen minutes each way. So, at
  seven-thirty, I went into my dressing-room on the ground floor of the
  building, locked the door on the inside, and stepped through a window into
  the alley that runs along beside the theater.</p>

  <p>"Shelah had told me about the pavilion, she said she was giving a dinner
  party, but that I needn't meet any of the guests&mdash;my make-up, you know,
  and all that. She wanted to see me alone, anyhow. I reached here about
  seven-forty-five. Shelah met me on the lawn, and we went to the pavilion. She
  looked at me in a strange way&mdash;I wondered if she still cared for me. I
  was shocked at the change in her&mdash;when I knew her she was fresh and
  lovely and so very gay. Hollywood had altered her greatly. Oh,
  well&mdash;none of us grows younger, I suppose. We wasted precious time in
  reminiscences, living over the past&mdash;somehow, it seemed to make her
  happy, just to remember. I was nervous about the time&mdash;I kept looking at
  my watch. Finally I said that I must go."</p>

  <p>He was silent. "And then&mdash;" Chan prompted.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was odd," Fyfe continued. "I'd got the impression over the
  telephone, and even more so after I saw her, that she wanted my advice about
  some terribly pressing matter. But when I told her I was going, she only
  stared at me in a sort of pitiful way. 'Bob,' she said, 'you still care for
  me a little, don't you?' She was standing close to me, and I took her in my
  arms. 'I adore you,' I cried, and&mdash;but I needn't go into that. I had
  that moment&mdash;no one can take it from me. Thoughts of the happy past came
  back&mdash;I was torn between my love for Shelah and that damn watch ticking
  in my very brain. I told her hurriedly that I would return after the play,
  that I would see her daily during her stay here, that we would swim
  together&mdash;I had a wild idea that perhaps I could win her all over again.
  And perhaps I could have done it&mdash;but now&mdash;now&mdash;" His voice
  broke. "Poor Shelah! Poor girl!"</p>

  <p>Chan nodded gravely. "It has been well said, those who live too
  conspicuously tempt the notice of Fate."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose no one ever lived more conspicuously than Shelah," Fyfe
  added. He gave Charlie a quick penetrating glance. "Look here,
  Inspector&mdash;you mustn't fail me. You must find out who has done this
  awful thing."</p>

  <p>"Such is my aim," Chan assured him. "You departed at once?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I left her standing there&mdash;standing there smiling, alive and
  well. Smiling, and crying too. I dashed out of the pavilion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was now what time?"</p>

  <p>"I know only too well&mdash;it was four minutes past eight. I rushed down
  the drive, found my car where I'd left it before the house, and motored back
  to town as quickly as I could. When I stepped through the window of my
  dressing-room, they were hammering like wild men on my door. I opened it,
  said I'd been having a nap, and went out with the stage manager to the wings.
  I was five minutes late&mdash;the stage manager showed me his
  watch&mdash;eight-twenty. But that wasn't serious&mdash;I went on and played
  my role&mdash;and I was just coming off after the first act when some young
  man telephoned me the terrible news."</p>

  <p>He stood up. "That, Inspector Chan, is my story. My visit out here
  to-night may prove embarrassing for me, but I don't regret it. I saw Shelah
  again&mdash;I held her in my arms&mdash;and for that privilege I stand ready
  to pay any price you can name. Is there anything more I can tell you?"</p>

  <p>Chan shook his head. "For the present, no. I ask that you remain on scene
  a brief time. Other matters may arise later."</p>

  <p>"Of course," nodded Fyfe.</p>

  <p>The bell rang, and Charlie himself went to the door. Peering into the
  night, he beheld a burly dark-skinned man in the khaki uniform of the
  Honolulu police.</p>

  <p>"Ah, it is Spencer," he said. "I am very glad to have you here."</p>

  <p>The officer came into the hall, dragging after him a figure that, anywhere
  save on a tropic beach, would have been quite unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"I picked this up on Kalakaua Avenue," the policeman explained. "I thought
  you might like to see him. He's a little mixed on what he's been doing
  to-night."</p>

  <p>The man to whom he referred shook off the officer's grip and stepped
  toward Charlie. "I trust we're not too late for dinner," he remarked. He
  stood for a moment looking about the hall and then, as though prompted by old
  memories, removed from his head a limp and tattered hat of straw. "My
  chauffeur is really rather stupid. He lost his way."</p>

  <p>His manner was jaunty and debonair, no mean triumph considering his
  costume. Aside from the hat, which he now clutched in a thin freckled hand,
  that costume consisted of a badly soiled pair of white duck trousers, a blue
  shirt open at the throat, a disreputable velvet coat that had once been the
  color of Burgundy and the remnants of a pair of shoes, through the holes of
  which peered the white of his naked feet.</p>

  <p>The buzz of conversation from the dining-room had died, the group in there
  appeared to be listening, and Charlie hastily held open the curtains to the
  living-room. "Come in here, please," he said, and they entered to find Fyfe
  waiting there alone. For a moment the man in the velvet coat stared at the
  actor, and under the yellow ragged beard that had not known barber's scissors
  for a month, a slow smile appeared.</p>

  <p>"Now," Chan said. "Who are you? Where do you live?"</p>

  <p>The man shrugged. "The name," he replied, "might be Smith."</p>

  <p>"It might also be Jones," Charlie suggested.</p>

  <p>"A mere matter of taste. Personally, I prefer Smith."</p>

  <p>"And you live&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith hesitated. "To put it crudely, officer, I'm afraid I'm on the
  beach."</p>

  <p>Charlie smiled. "Ah, you uphold noble tradition. What would Waikiki be
  without beach-comber?" He went to the window that led to the lanai and
  summoned Kashimo. "Kindly search this gentleman," he directed.</p>

  <p>"By all means," the beach-comber agreed. "And if you find anything that
  looks like money, in heaven's name let me know about it at once."</p>

  <p>Kashimo's search revealed little&mdash;a piece of string, a comb, a rusty
  pocket-knife, and an object which at first glance looked like a coin, but
  which turned out to be a medal. Charlie took this and studied it.</p>

  <p>"Temple bronze medal, Third Prize, Landscapes in oils," he read. "The
  Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts." He looked inquiringly at Smith.</p>

  <p>The beach-comber shrugged. "Yes," he said. "I see I shall have to confess
  it all now&mdash;I'm a painter. Not much of a one at that&mdash;the third
  prize only, you will observe. The first medal was of gold&mdash;it might have
  come in handy of late, if I'd won it. But I didn't." He came a bit nearer.
  "If it's not asking too much&mdash;just what is the reason for this
  unwarranted intrusion into my affairs? Can't a gentleman go about his
  business in this town without being pawed by a fat policeman, and searched by
  a thin one?"</p>

  <p>"We are sorry to inconvenience you, Mr. Smith," Charlie replied politely.
  "But tell me&mdash;have you been on the beach to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I have not. I've been in town. I walked out&mdash;for reasons which we
  needn't take up now. I was going along Kalakaua when this cop&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where down-town have you been?"</p>

  <p>"In Aala Park."</p>

  <p>"You talked with some one there?"</p>

  <p>"I did. The company was not select, but I made it do."</p>

  <p>"Not on the beach to-night." Chan was staring at the man's feet. "Kashimo,
  you and Spencer will kindly escort this gentleman out to spot below window
  where you discovered footprints, and make careful comparison."</p>

  <p>"I know," cried the Japanese eagerly. He went out with the other policeman
  and the beach-comber.</p>

  <p>Chan turned to Fyfe. "Long arduous task," he commented. "But man, without
  work, becomes&mdash;what? A Mr. Smith. Will you be seated at your ease?"</p>

  <p>The others entered from the dining-room, and to them also Charlie offered
  chairs, which most of them accepted with poor grace. Alan Jaynes was
  consulting his watch. Eleven o'clock&mdash;he sought Chan's eyes. But the
  detective looked innocently the other way.</p>

  <p>Tarneverro came close to Charlie. "Anything new?" he inquired, under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"The inquiry widens," Chan answered.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather it narrowed down," replied the fortune-teller.</p>

  <p>The two policemen and the beach-comber returned through the lanai. Spencer
  again had the latter firmly in his grip.</p>

  <p>"O.K., Charlie," said the uniformed man. "The footprints under the window
  could have been made by only one pair of shoes in Honolulu." He pointed at
  the beach-comber's battered footwear. "Those shoes," he added.</p>

  <p>Smith looked down, smiling whimsically. "They are a shocking bad pair,
  aren't they?" he inquired. "But Hawaii, you know, seems to have no
  appreciation of art. If you've noticed the paintings they buy to hang in
  their parlors&mdash;the wooden waves put on canvas by the local
  Rembrandts&mdash;I may be a third-rater, but I couldn't bring myself to do
  stuff like that. Not even for a new pair of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come here!" cut in Charlie sharply. "You lied to me."</p>

  <p>Smith shrugged. "You put things bluntly for one of your race, officer. It
  may be that I distorted the situation slightly in the interests
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The interests of what?"</p>

  <p>"The interests of Smith. I observe that there is something wrong here, and
  I much prefer to keep out of it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are in it now. Tell me&mdash;did you enter that beach house
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I did not&mdash;I'll swear to that. True, I stood beneath the window for
  a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"What were you doing there?"</p>

  <p>"I was planning to make the sand in the shelter of the pavilion my lodging
  for the night. It's a favorite place of mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go back to beginning," cut in Chan. "The truth this time."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't been out to the beach for three days and nights," the man told
  him. "I got a little money, and I've been stopping down-town. When I was out
  here last, this house was unoccupied. To-day my money was gone&mdash;I'm
  expecting a check&mdash;it hasn't come." He paused. "Rotten mail service out
  here. If I could only get back to the mainland&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your money was gone," Charlie interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;so I was forced back to my old couch under the palm trees. I
  walked out from town, and got to the beach&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At what time?"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir,&mdash;you embarrass me. If you will take a stroll along
  Hotel Street, you will see my watch hanging in a certain window. I often go
  and look at it myself."</p>

  <p>"No matter. You got to the beach."</p>

  <p>"I did. It's public, you know&mdash;this one out here. It belongs to
  everybody. I was surprised to see a light in the pavilion. Somebody's rented
  the house, I thought. The curtain of that window was down, but it was
  flapping in the wind. I heard voices inside&mdash;a man's and a
  woman's&mdash;I wondered whether it was such a good place to sleep, after
  all."</p>

  <p>He paused. Charlie's eyes were on Robert Fyfe. The actor was leaning
  forward with a fierce intensity, staring at the beach-comber, his hands
  clenched until the knuckles showed white.</p>

  <p>"I just stood there," Smith continued. "The curtain flopped
  about&mdash;and I got a good look at the man."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," Charlie nodded. "What man?"</p>

  <p>"Why, that fellow there," Smith said. He pointed at Fyfe. "The chap with
  the red ribbon across his shirt-front. I haven't seen one of those ribbons
  since the time when I was studying at Julien's, in Paris, and our ambassador
  invited me round for dinner. It's a fact. He came from my town&mdash;an old
  friend of my father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No matter," Charlie cut in. "You stood there, peeping beneath the
  curtain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" cried the beach-comber. "Don't judge a man by his
  clothes, please. I wasn't spying. If I caught a glimpse, as I did, it was
  unavoidable. They were talking fast, those two&mdash;this man, and the
  woman."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And perhaps&mdash;equally unavoidable, do not misunderstand
  me&mdash;you heard what they said?"</p>

  <p>Smith hesitated. "Well&mdash;as a matter of fact&mdash;I did. I heard her
  tell him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a little cry, Robert Fyfe leaped forward. He pushed the beach-comber
  aside and stood before Charlie. His face was deathly pale, but his eyes did
  not falter.</p>

  <p>"Drop it," he said hoarsely. "I can put an end to your investigation here
  and now. I killed Shelah Fane, and I'm willing to pay for it."</p>

  <p>A shocked silence greeted his words. Calm, unmoved, quite motionless, Chan
  stared into the man's face.</p>

  <p>"You killed Miss Fane?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"For what reason?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted her to come back to me. I couldn't live without her. I pleaded
  and begged&mdash;and she wouldn't listen. She laughed at me&mdash;she said
  there wasn't a chance. She drove me to it&mdash;I killed her. I had to do
  it."</p>

  <p>"You killed her&mdash;with what?"</p>

  <p>"With a knife I carried as one of the props in the play."</p>

  <p>"Where is it now?"</p>

  <p>"I threw it into a swamp on my way to town."</p>

  <p>"You can lead me to the spot?"</p>

  <p>"I can try."</p>

  <p>Chan turned away.</p>

  <p>Alan Jaynes was on his feet. "Eleven-ten," he cried. "I can just make the
  boat if I hurry, Inspector. Of course, you're not going to hold me now."</p>

  <p>"But I do hold you," Charlie answered. "Spencer, if this man makes another
  move, kindly place him beneath arrest."</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" Jaynes cried. "You have your confession, haven't
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With regard to that," said Charlie, "wait just a moment, please." He
  turned back to Fyfe, who was standing quietly beside him. "You left the
  pavilion, Mr. Fyfe, at four minutes past eight?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"You had already killed Shelah Fane?"</p>

  <p>"I had."</p>

  <p>"You drove to the theater and were in the wings of same at twenty minutes
  past eight?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I told you all that."</p>

  <p>"The stage manager will swear that you were there at twenty minutes past
  eight?"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;of course."</p>

  <p>Chan stared at him. "Yet at twelve minutes past eight," he said, "Shelah
  Fane was seen alive and well."</p>

  <p>"What's that!" Tarneverro cried.</p>

  <p>"Pardon&mdash;I am speaking with this other gentleman. At twelve minutes
  past eight, Mr. Fyfe, Shelah Fane was seen alive and well. How do you account
  for that?"</p>

  <p>Fyfe dropped into a chair and covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you," Charlie said gently. "You wish me to believe
  you killed Shelah Fane. Yet, of all the people in this room, you alone have
  unshakable alibi."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">IX. &mdash; EIGHTEEN IMPORTANT MINUTES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No one spoke. Outside what Jimmy Bradshaw had called the
  silken surf broke once again on the coral sand. The crash died away, and
  inside that crowded room there was no sound save the ticking of a small clock
  on a mantel beneath which fires were rarely lighted. With a gesture of
  despair, Alan Jaynes stepped to a table and, striking a match, applied it to
  one of his small cigars. Charlie crossed over and laid his hand on Fyfe's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Why have you confessed to a deed you did not perform?" he asked. "That is
  something I warmly desire to know."</p>

  <p>The actor made no answer, nor did he so much as look up. Charlie turned to
  face Tarneverro.</p>

  <p>"So Shelah Fane was seen alive at twelve minutes past eight?" the
  fortune-teller remarked suavely. "Would you mind telling me how long you have
  known that?"</p>

  <p>Charlie smiled. "If only it happened you understood Chinese language," he
  replied. "I would not find it necessary to elucidate." He went to the door,
  and called Jessop. When the butler appeared, Chan asked that he send in Wu
  Kno-ching at once. "I am doing something now for your benefit alone, Mr.
  Tarneverro," he added.</p>

  <p>"You are a considerate man, Inspector," the fortune-teller answered.</p>

  <p>The old Chinese shuffled into the room; he was, evidently, in a rather
  peevish frame of mind. His carefully prepared dinner had been ruined by the
  events of this tragic evening, and he was in no mood to accept the philosophy
  of the patient K'ung-fu-tsze.</p>

  <p>Chan talked with him for a moment, again in Cantonese, and then turned to
  Tarneverro. "I request that he verify story he told me in native language
  when I interrogated him in this room some while ago," he explained. "Wu, you
  have said you lingered in kitchen with Jessop and Anna when clock was
  speaking the hour of eight. You fretted because dinner was seemingly movable
  feast, and also because bootlegger of your choice had not shown up and was
  causing you to lose much face. Am I correct so far?"</p>

  <p>"Bootleggah velly late," nodded Wu.</p>

  <p>"But at ten minutes past hour, erring friend of yours makes panting
  appearance with hotly desired liquids. While Jessop begins task of making
  this poison palatable, you wander away in search of mistress." Chan glanced
  at the fortune-teller. "Wu informal type servant who pops up anywhere on
  place with great bland look. Characteristic of the race." He resumed his
  remarks to the Chinese. "You discover Miss Shelah Fane alone in pavilion.
  Vindicating your honor, you announce bootlegger friend has finally appeared.
  What did Missie say?"</p>

  <p>"Missie look-see watch, say twelve minutes aftah eight plitty muchee time
  bootleggah come. I say plitty muchee time dinnah gets on table. Mebbe that
  can happen now if not new cook needed heah wikiwiki."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Then she ordered you to get out and not annoy her with your bothers.
  So you went back to kitchen. That's what you told me before, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, boss."</p>

  <p>"All same true, eh, Wu?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, boss. Wha' foah my tell lie to you?"</p>

  <p>"All right. You can go now."</p>

  <p>"My go, boss."</p>

  <p>As the old man moved silently away on his velvet slippers, Charlie turned
  to meet the penetrating gaze of Tarneverro. "All of which is very
  interesting," the fortune-teller said coldly. "I perceive that when I pointed
  out to you the matter of the watch, I was merely wasting my breath. You
  already knew that Shelah Fane had not been murdered at two minutes past
  eight."</p>

  <p>Charlie laid a conciliatory hand on Tarneverro's arm. "Pray do not take
  offense. I knew Miss Fane had been seen at that later hour, yes; but I was
  still uncertain of how watch had been manipulated. I listened, curious and
  then entranced, to your logical explanation. Could I, at its finish, rudely
  cry thanks for nothing? A gentleman is always courteous. Much better I shower
  you with well-deserved words of praise, so you go forward with vigorous and
  triumphant mood of heart."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" remarked Tarneverro, moving off.</p>

  <p>Charlie stepped up to the beach-comber. "Mr. Smith," he said.</p>

  <p>"Right here, officer," Smith answered. "I was afraid you were going to
  forget me. What can I do for you now?"</p>

  <p>"A moment ago you began interesting recital of conversation overheard
  between this gentleman with ribbon-bedecked shirt-front and lady he met in
  pavilion to-night. At crucial point you suffered very blunt interruption. I
  am most eager that you return to subject at once."</p>

  <p>Fyfe rose to his feet, and stared hard at the derelict in the velvet coat.
  Smith looked back at him, and a speculative, cunning look flashed into his
  pale gray eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," he said slowly. "I was interrupted, wasn't I? But I'm used to
  that. Sure&mdash;sure, I was telling you that I heard them talking together.
  Well, there's no need to go on with it now. I've nothing to add to what the
  gentleman has already told you." Fyfe turned away. "He was pleading with her
  to come back to him&mdash;said he loved her, and all that. And she wouldn't
  listen to him. I felt rather sorry for him&mdash;I've been in that position
  myself. I heard her say: 'Oh, Bob&mdash;what's the use?' He went on
  insisting. Every now and then he looked at his watch. 'My time's up,' he said
  at last. 'I've got to go. We'll thrash this out later.' I heard the slam of
  the door&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the woman was alone in the room&mdash;alive and well. You are sure of
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;the curtain was flapping&mdash;I saw her after he left. She was
  there alone&mdash;moving about."</p>

  <p>With a puzzled frown, Charlie glanced at Robert Fyfe. "You are not content
  with one alibi. You have now a second. I do not understand you, Mr.
  Fyfe."</p>

  <p>The actor shrugged. "I find it hard to understand myself, Inspector. A fit
  of temperament, perhaps. We stage people are inclined to be overly
  dramatic."</p>

  <p>"Then you withdraw your confession?"</p>

  <p>"What else can I do?" Chan did not overlook the glance that passed between
  the immaculate actor and the battered beach-comber. "Others have withdrawn it
  for me. I did not kill Shelah&mdash;that's quite true. But I thought it would
  be better if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If what?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"You thought it would be better if my investigation went no further."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at all."</p>

  <p>"Something came out in that conversation with your ex-wife which you
  feared this man had overheard. Something you want suppressed."</p>

  <p>"You have a keen imagination, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"Also, I have a custom to discover facts which some people want to hide.
  Your move has been to this moment successful&mdash;but you and I have not
  finished with each other, Mr. Fyfe."</p>

  <p>"I am at your service at any time, sir."</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much, but I hope the next time we meet your service will be
  of more value to my humble self." He looked at Smith. "As for you, though I
  am desolated by acute pain to make so rude a remark, I believe you mix plenty
  falsehood with your truth."</p>

  <p>The beach-comber shrugged. "There you go&mdash;judging a man by his
  clothes again."</p>

  <p>"Not by your clothes, which are silent, but by your tongue, which speaks,"
  Charlie told him. "Mr. Spencer, will you kindly take this man to station
  house and make record of his finger-prints."</p>

  <p>"So many attentions," Smith put in. "I only hope they don't turn my
  head."</p>

  <p>"After which," Chan continued, "you may release him&mdash;for time
  being."</p>

  <p>"All right, Charlie," Spencer said.</p>

  <p>"One other thing. Pause a moment while I introduce to you all people in
  this room." Gravely he went through that somewhat lengthy ceremony. "You have
  also seen butler and cook. There is in addition a maid, whom I ask that you
  pause and make note of on your way out. You will speed from station without
  delay to Pier Seven, from which the boat Oceanic sails for coast at midnight.
  No person you have seen in this house is to sail on that boat. You
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, Charlie&mdash;I'll attend to it," Spencer nodded.</p>

  <p>Jaynes stepped forward. "I'd like to remind you that my luggage is aboard
  that ship&mdash;some of it in the hold&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie nodded. "How fortunate you spoke of that. Mr. Spencer, kindly see
  that all effects in stateroom belonging to Mr. Jaynes are put ashore in your
  care. Arrange for such as lie in hold to be guarded for the gentleman at San
  Francisco dock. Explain he is detained by important business and may be in
  Honolulu for some time. Is that satisfactory, Mr. Jaynes?"</p>

  <p>"It's damned unsatisfactory," the Britisher growled, "but I presume I
  shall have to make the best of it."</p>

  <p>"All you can do," nodded Charlie. "Kashimo, you will accompany Mr. Spencer
  down-town. Your passionate labors in this house are ended for the night. You
  retire in glory&mdash;and if you come back through unexpected window, you
  retire for ever. Keep same in mind."</p>

  <p>The apprentice detective nodded, and went out after Spencer and the
  beach-comber. Robert Fyfe stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Is there any necessity for my staying any longer?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Charlie studied him thoughtfully. "I think not. You may go along. You and
  I will talk together when I have more leisure."</p>

  <p>"Any time, Inspector." Fyfe went to the curtains, and held them open. "I
  am stopping at the Waioli Hotel, on Fort Street," he added. "Drop in at your
  convenience, won't you? Good night." He went into the hall, where Spencer
  could be heard talking with the maid. The door slammed behind him, and a
  second later, the two policemen and Smith also departed.</p>

  <p>Charlie stood regarding the tired group in the living-room. "Accept my
  advice and take heart," he said. "We give Mr. Spencer generous handicap on
  journey to pier, and then I find great joy releasing this company at last.
  While we are waiting, there are one or two matters. Since first I spoke with
  you, it has been found necessary to alter views. Then hour of tragedy was
  thought certain at two minutes past eight. Now we must advance and say,
  dreadful event happened some time between twelve minutes past eight and the
  half-hour. Eighteen minutes there&mdash;eighteen important minutes. Each of
  us must ask himself: What was I doing in those eighteen minutes?"</p>

  <p>He paused. His eyes were bright, his manner quite keen and alive&mdash;for
  him. The Chinese are at their best at night; it is their favorite time. But
  he was alone in his vigor, the others were exhausted and drooping, the makeup
  of the women stood out, unnatural and far from pleasing, against the pallor
  of their weariness.</p>

  <p>"Eighteen important minutes," Chan repeated. "Miss Dixon, Miss Julie and
  Mr. Bradshaw disported gaily in breakers, visiting beach occasionally. On
  that beach Mrs. Ballou sat and idly passed time until dinner. For final ten
  of those minutes, Mr. Ballou wandered about, no one can say where&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can say where," Ballou cut in. "I came into this room&mdash;the butler
  will verify that. I strolled in here and smoked a cigarette he gave me."</p>

  <p>"He remained with you while you smoked it?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he didn't. He lighted it for me, and went out. When he returned,
  I was sitting in the same chair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You wish me to note that, eh?" Charlie smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether you note it or not."</p>

  <p>Charlie took out a handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his brow.
  The tropic night was beginning to live up to its reputation.</p>

  <p>"I turn now to the four gentlemen whose alibis have been so rudely
  shattered. I know where they were at two minutes past eight, but after
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take me first," said Tarneverro. "You saw me go to join those two people
  in the lounge of the hotel&mdash;they are old friends of mine from Australia.
  We remained there for a few minutes after you left, and then I suggested that
  we go out on the lanai that faces the palm court. We did so, and for a time
  sat and chatted. When I finally looked at my watch, it was precisely
  eight-thirty. I remarked on the hour and said I was sorry, but I had to go
  along. We all went inside, I ran up to get my hat, and when I came back to
  the lobby, I happened on you near the door."</p>

  <p>Charlie studied his face. "Your old friends will be willing to swear to
  all this?"</p>

  <p>"I can see no reason why they shouldn't. They know it's true."</p>

  <p>Chan smiled. "I congratulate you, Mr. Tarneverro."</p>

  <p>"I congratulate myself, Inspector. You may recall that I told you I had
  another tree."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jaynes," said Chan, turning to the Britisher.</p>

  <p>Jaynes shrugged hopelessly. "I have no alibi," he said. "During those
  eighteen minutes, I was wandering along the beach, alone. Make what you wish
  of it. I didn't come down here."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Van Horn&mdash;you did come down here?" Charlie addressed the picture
  actor.</p>

  <p>"I did, worse luck," shrugged Van Horn. "The first time in a long and
  honorable career that I ever got to a party ahead of the hour set. It will be
  a lesson to me&mdash;I can tell you that."</p>

  <p>"It was, I believe, eight-fifteen when Jessop admitted you?"</p>

  <p>"About that time&mdash;yes. He told me that the party&mdash;or what there
  was of it&mdash;had moved to the beach. I went out on the lawn. I saw a light
  in a building which Jessop told me was a summer-house, and I thought of going
  there. I wish to heaven I had. But I heard voices down by the water, so I
  went there instead. I sat down by Rita Ballou&mdash;but you know all
  that."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "Only one remains. Mr. Martino?"</p>

  <p>The director frowned. "Like Huntley and Mr. Jaynes," he said, "I have no
  alibi worth mentioning. You wrecked me along with them when you smashed that
  eight-two theory." He took a handkerchief from a side pocket and mopped his
  forehead. "After Jaynes left me and started down the beach, I sat in one of
  the hotel swings near the water. I should have been busy getting myself a
  good alibi, I suppose, but I'm not so clever as Mr. Tarneverro here." He gave
  the fortune-teller an unfriendly look. "So I just sat alone&mdash;the scene
  looked rather good to me. I wished I could get it into a picture&mdash;the
  purple starry sky, the yellow lamps along the waterfront, the black hulk of
  Diamond Head. A picture in color&mdash;we'll have 'em that way before long. I
  amused myself thinking up a possible story&mdash;you can't depend on authors
  for anything. Presently I looked at my watch. It was eight-twenty-five, so I
  went to my room to brush up and get my hat. When I came down I met you and
  Tarneverro here, and heard the news of Miss Fane's murder."</p>

  <p>Charlie stood looking thoughtfully at the director. Suddenly he was pushed
  aside as Tarneverro strode forward.</p>

  <p>"That's a nasty scratch on your forehead, Martino," the fortune-teller
  cried.</p>

  <p>Startled, the director put his hand to his brow, and on one finger, as he
  took it away, he noted a trace of red.</p>

  <p>"By jove," he said, "that's odd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd better turn over to Inspector Chan the handkerchief you just
  replaced in your pocket."</p>

  <p>"What handkerchief?" Martino produced the one which he had recently passed
  across his forehead. "Oh, this!"</p>

  <p>"I will take it, please," said Charlie. He spread the white square of silk
  on a table and brought out his magnifying-glass. For a moment he studied the
  center of the square, then ran his fingers lightly across it. He looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"A queer thing, Mr. Martino," he remarked. "There exist, caught in mesh of
  this cloth, a few thin splinters of glass. How would you explain that?"</p>

  <p>Martino rose quickly, and with a serious face bent over the table. "I
  can't explain it," he said. "I can't even explain how that handkerchief came
  to be in my pocket."</p>

  <p>Chan regarded him intently. "It is not your property?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"It certainly isn't," the director replied. "I carry two handkerchiefs
  with my evening clothes. One here"&mdash;he indicated his breast pocket above
  which the ends of a handkerchief were showing&mdash;"and another in my hip
  pocket." He produced a second. "Certainly I'd have no use for a third. I just
  happened to reach into my side pocket, my hand touched this, and I used it.
  But I never put it there, and it isn't mine."</p>

  <p>"A likely story," Tarneverro sneered.</p>

  <p>"My dear Tarneverro," the director said, "when you've made as many
  pictures as I have, you'll realize that the truth often sounds less probable
  than fiction." He picked up the little square of silk and handed it to
  Charlie. "By the way, there's a laundry mark in one corner of that."</p>

  <p>"I know," Chan nodded. He stood for a moment, looking at the tiny letter B
  done with black ink on the silk border. He glanced over at Wilkie Ballou. The
  planter stared back at him, and taking a handkerchief from his own pocket,
  casually mopped his brow.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">X. &mdash; "SHELAH FROM DENNY"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Shrugging his broad shoulders, Charlie turned back to
  Martino. The director's face was even more crimson than usual, and he was
  breathing hard.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to make statement," Chan asked, "as to moment when you think
  this object was placed on your person?"</p>

  <p>Martino considered. "When we were leaving the dining-room a while back,"
  he said, "we were all crowded together round the door. I thought then that I
  felt a little tug at my pocket."</p>

  <p>"Just who was near you at that instant?"</p>

  <p>"It's hard to say. Everybody was there together. The matter is serious,
  and I don't like to guess." He paused, and glanced at the fortune-teller. "I
  do recall that Mr. Tarneverro wasn't far away."</p>

  <p>"Is that an accusation?" asked Tarneverro coldly.</p>

  <p>"Not precisely. I can't be sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd like nothing better than to be sure," the fortune-teller
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Martino laughed. "You've hit it there, my friend. I haven't much love for
  you, and you know it. If I'd had my way, you'd have been run out of Hollywood
  long ago."</p>

  <p>"Failing that, you've gone about secretly warning the women against
  me."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, secretly? I've done it openly, and you know it. I've
  told them to keep away from you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I don't like the look in your eyes, my friend. What was it you told poor
  Shelah this morning? What did she tell you?"</p>

  <p>"That is something I'd not be likely to discuss with you. So you sat on
  the beach by the water, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't get too cocky over that alibi of yours," Martino cried. "How
  did you happen to have it so pat and ready? Reading the future again,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, gentlemen," Charlie protested. "We are arriving precisely
  nowhere by this. I perceive that nerves are very much up on edge, and I am
  glad to push open doors and put quick end to investigation. You are all free
  to depart."</p>

  <p>There was an instant dash for the hall. Chan followed.</p>

  <p>"Just one word to add," he said, "though I am certain that by now the buzz
  of my voice in your ears must be most tiresome sound. But please
  remember&mdash;you rest on small island in the midst of broad Pacific ocean.
  Attempt by any one of you to go aboard ship will be instantly known to us,
  and regarded with dark suspicious eye. Stay on, I beg of you, and enjoy
  beauties of spot, on which subject Mr. Bradshaw will be happy to make oration
  for you any time, any place."</p>

  <p>"That's right," the boy nodded. "Loaf on a palm-fringed shore and forget
  your troubles. Somewhere winter is raging&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In July?" Van Horn inquired.</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;at the South Pole, for example. Put Hollywood out of your
  thoughts. Remember&mdash;Hawaii has the climate California thinks it
  has."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind Ballou and his wife. Van Horn, Martino and Jaynes
  followed promptly. Bradshaw resumed to the living-room, where Julie and Diana
  had remained, leaving the fortune-teller and Charlie in the hall. Tarneverro
  picked up his hat.</p>

  <p>"Inspector," he remarked, "you have my sympathy. You are up against a
  puzzling case."</p>

  <p>"Also I have your help," Chan reminded him. "The thought consoles me."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro shook his head. "I'm afraid you over-estimate my powers. But
  whatever they are, they are ranged on your side. When am I to see you
  again?"</p>

  <p>"I will call on you to-morrow morning," Chan answered. "We will have good
  long talk. Perhaps, thinking deeply into matter over night, each of us will
  have new ideas to offer."</p>

  <p>"I shall try to supply my share," nodded Tarneverro, and went out. For a
  moment Charlie stood looking at the door through which he had gone, then
  turning, he went into the living-room.</p>

  <p>"Miss Dixon," he said, "may I make further request of you? Will you ascend
  stairs with me and point out various rooms naming the persons to whom they
  have been assigned? I still have a little searching to do before repose."</p>

  <p>"Of course," nodded the actress, "and speaking of repose, I hope you'll
  search my room first. I feel all in after this dreadful evening."</p>

  <p>She and Charlie disappeared. With a forlorn gesture, Julie sank into a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Poor kid!" said Mr. Bradshaw.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jimmy&mdash;it has been a dreadful evening, hasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It surely has. Think, Julie, think. You were closer to Shelah Fane than
  any one else. Have you no idea who did&mdash;this terrible thing?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I can't imagine. Of course, Shelah had
  enemies&mdash;all successful people have&mdash;she was envied, perhaps even
  hated. But I never dreamed any one hated her as much as this. It's just
  unbelievable, that's all."</p>

  <p>The boy sat down beside her. "Let's forget it for a while. How about you?
  What are you going to do now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I suppose I'll go back where I came from."</p>

  <p>"Where did you come from? You haven't told me."</p>

  <p>"From a theatrical boardinghouse in Chicago&mdash;I was traveling with my
  mother when she&mdash;she left me. Stage people, you see, all my
  folks&mdash;father too. Mother called San Francisco home, though she seldom
  saw it. But she was born there&mdash;so many good actors were, you know. And
  she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She was one of the best, I guess," said Jimmy Bradshaw.</p>

  <p>"I thought so. I've got a grandmother there now&mdash;seventy-two, but she
  goes trouping occasionally&mdash;she's such a darling, Jimmy. I think I'll go
  to her, and get some sort of job&mdash;I could make good in an office, I
  believe. Grandmother would be glad to have me; we're all that's left
  of&mdash;us."</p>

  <p>Bradshaw pulled himself together. "If no one else wants to speak, may I
  say a few words about Hawaii? Everywhere we have poetry and glamour. The
  climate breeds happiness and laughter, a natural reflection of the sunlight,
  the rainbows and the purple hills. Here there are no sunstrokes and no snow.
  Honolulu has its message of beauty for every heart. As for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jimmy, what in the world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As for the people, where nature is kind man can not help but be. You will
  find&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't get you, Jimmy."</p>

  <p>"It's simple enough. I've sold this place to fifty thousand tourists, and
  now I want to sell it to you. As a substitute for grandmother, you see. No
  doubt she's a darling, as you say. Maybe I'm not, but I'm young yet. For of
  course it isn't just Honolulu I'm selling. I'm thrown in, you know. How about
  it, Julie? A little bungalow nestling under two mortgages and a bougainvillea
  vine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you mean you love me, Jimmy?" the girl asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, lord&mdash;did I omit that line? I shall have to rewrite the whole
  darn piece. Naturally, I love you. Who wouldn't? It may not be the most
  fitting time for me to say all this, but I don't want you to think that I've
  fallen into the habit of putting things off, just because I live in the lazy
  latitudes. I'm crazy about you, and before you write grandmother to come down
  and meet your boat&mdash;she might be away trouping anyhow&mdash;I want you
  to give a thought to Hawaii&mdash;and to me. Will you do it, Julie?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I will, Jimmy."</p>

  <p>"That's good enough for me," he smiled.</p>

  <p>Chan came silently into the room, and the boy stood up. "Well, Charlie,
  you ready to go along? I let my brother have my car to-night, so I'm honoring
  you with my presence in that famous flivver of yours."</p>

  <p>"You will be remarkably welcome," Chan told him. "Yes&mdash;I travel
  townward almost at once. There remains one little matter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anna, the maid, came hurriedly into the room. "Miss Dixon said you wanted
  to see me," she remarked to Chan.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "A trifling affair. You told me earlier this evening that a
  certain ring was missing from Miss Fane's finger after the homicide. An
  emerald ring."</p>

  <p>"I did, sir."</p>

  <p>Julie O'Neill was leaning forward, breathless, her eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Is this the ring?" Chan suddenly produced a platinum band decorated with
  a surprising stone that flashed green in the brightly lighted room.</p>

  <p>"That is it, sir," Anna nodded.</p>

  <p>Chan turned to Julie. "So sorry to drag you in. But will you kindly tell
  me&mdash;how does it happen I find this bauble in the drawer of your
  dressing-table?" The girl gasped, and Jimmy Bradshaw looked at her in
  amazement. "I am very sorry this question comes out, which disappoints me
  sadly," Charlie continued. "But I should say, things need explanation."</p>

  <p>"It's very simple," answered Julie in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," bowed Chan. "Just how simple, according to your story?"</p>

  <p>"Well." She hesitated. "There are only a few of us here&mdash;I can speak
  frankly. Shelah was always hard up. Somehow money meant nothing to her, it
  slipped through her fingers, it was gone a moment after she got it. She came
  back from the South Seas in her usual state&mdash;more or less broke. Every
  one was always cheating her, stealing from her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Every one?" Chan repeated. "You mean her servants, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Some of them, yes&mdash;when they had a chance. But that doesn't matter.
  Shelah arrived here in need of money, as always. She'd drawn all the advance
  she could get from the company&mdash;they haven't been as generous of late as
  they used to be. To-day, just after she reached the house, she sent for me
  and said she must have ready money at once. She gave me this ring and told me
  to sell it for her, if I could. I was to make a round of the jewelers
  immediately&mdash;this afternoon. But I put it off. I wasn't keen for the
  job. However, I fully intended to go in the morning&mdash;if this thing
  hadn't happened to-night. That's how I chanced to have the ring."</p>

  <p>Chan considered. "She gave it to you just after she reached house. At what
  time, precisely?"</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock this morning."</p>

  <p>"You have had it ever since?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. I put it in that drawer&mdash;I thought it would be safe
  there."</p>

  <p>"That is all you wish to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"That is all." The girl seemed on the point of tears.</p>

  <p>Charlie turned to the maid. "You may go, Anna," he said.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir." Anna glanced at the girl, and then went out.</p>

  <p>Charlie sighed heavily. Even though he came of a nocturnal race, the night
  was beginning to wear on him. He took the ring beneath a light and examined
  it with his magnifying-glass. There was, he noted, an inscription inside.
  "Shelah from Denny." So Denny Mayo came back into the case? Chan
  shrugged.</p>

  <p>When he turned about, he perceived that Julie was weeping silently.
  Bradshaw had put his arm about her shoulder. "That's all right, honey," the
  boy said. "Charlie believes you. Don't you, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>Chan bowed from the waist. "In the presence of so much charm, could I have
  brutal doubts? Miss Julie, I am sorrowed to perceive your overwrought state.
  Mr. Bradshaw and I depart at once, leaving to you the solace of slumber. You
  have youth, and sleep will come. I bid you most sympathetic good night."</p>

  <p>He disappeared through the curtains, and with a few whispered words to the
  girl, Bradshaw followed. Jessop, restraining a yawn but firmly polite as
  always, saw them out. On the steps Charlie stood for a moment, staring at the
  sky and drawing in a deep breath of the open air.</p>

  <p>"It is something to recall," he said, "that during long painful ordeal in
  that house, stars were still shining and soft tropic night progressed as
  usual. What have I not been through? A brief respite will be lovely as soft
  music in the rain."</p>

  <p>They got into his car, waiting alone and lonely in the drive.</p>

  <p>"Pretty much up against it, eh, Charlie?" the boy suggested.</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "Dizzy feeling causes my head to circulate. I have upearthed
  so much, and yet I have upearthed nothing." They bowled along, past the Moana
  Hotel, in unaccustomed darkness now. The pink walls of the Grand glowed with
  a new splendor in the moonlight. "When you telephoned me," Chan added, "I was
  about to begin serious operation on a small fish. One taste I had was
  excellent. Alas! little fish and I will never meet again."</p>

  <p>"A shame to spoil your dinner," Bradshaw replied.</p>

  <p>"I will be content if your news does not also spoil my reputation,"
  Charlie told him. "How am I going to emerge from the affair? In shining
  garments of success, or in sack-cloth with ashes?"</p>

  <p>"I called up the morning paper," the boy told him. "Used to work there,
  you know. They were short of men at the moment, and I landed the job of
  covering the story so far. Got to go back now and write it. I'll say that the
  police haven't a notion just at present&mdash;is that correct?"</p>

  <p>Charlie barely avoided a collision with the curb. "Have you no better
  understanding of your task than that? Say nothing of the sort. Police have
  many clues and expect early arrest."</p>

  <p>"But that's the same old bunk, Charlie. And judging from your talk, it
  isn't true in this case."</p>

  <p>"Seldom true in any case," Chan reminded him. "You should know that."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll say it&mdash;to please you, Charlie. By the way, did I hear
  Tarneverro intimate he was working with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he fancies himself as bright assistant."</p>

  <p>"He may be bright all right&mdash;but are you keen for his help?"</p>

  <p>Charlie shrugged. "The bird chooses the tree, not the tree the bird," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tarneverro's a queer bird, all right. He gives me a funny sensation
  when I look at him." They rode on in silence for a time. "Anyhow, one thing's
  certain," the boy said at last.</p>

  <p>"Is that really so?" Chan inquired. "Name it, please. I seem to have
  overlooked it in my haste."</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;Julie had nothing to do with this affair."</p>

  <p>Charlie grinned in the dark. "I have recollections myself," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Being young&mdash;and muddled by love. Since I am now the father of
  eleven children, it is necessarily some time since I went about with head in
  clouds and warmly beating heart. But memories remain."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense," protested Bradshaw. "I'm looking at this thing
  coldly&mdash;as a rank outsider."</p>

  <p>"Then I humbly suggest you have old Hawaii moon overhauled at once,"
  commented Chan. "For it must be losing magic power you write about so
  glowingly."</p>

  <p>He drew up before the newspaper office, the sound of his brakes grating
  noisily in the deserted street. On the lower floor of the building one lonely
  light burned dimly, but the up-stairs windows were bright yellow with
  activity. There men sat sorting the cable news that was flowing in from the
  far corners of the world, from Europe, Asia, the mainland&mdash;brief bits of
  information thought worthy of transmission to this small island dreaming in
  the midst of the great Pacific.</p>

  <p>Jimmy Bradshaw moved as though to alight, then paused. Out of the corner
  of his eye he glanced at Charlie. "I don't suppose I can have it now, can I?"
  he inquired.</p>

  <p>"You can not," Chan replied firmly.</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?" asked the boy innocently.</p>

  <p>"Same thing you are," Charlie grinned.</p>

  <p>"I was referring to that handkerchief you took away from the picture
  director."</p>

  <p>"So was I," answered Charlie blandly.</p>

  <p>"Then you knew it was mine?"</p>

  <p>"I gathered that, yes. Small initial B was on it. Also I perceived you
  perspiring with no means to quench it. I was greatly moved to admiration by
  your restraint&mdash;not once did you make use of coat sleeve. You are going
  to tell me that it was taken from your pocket?"</p>

  <p>"It must have been&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"At what moment?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but I suppose some one took it when I was in swimming."</p>

  <p>"You are sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems the only possible explanation. But I didn't notice it was
  gone until a long time afterward."</p>

  <p>"And a still longer time after that&mdash;you mention the affair to
  me."</p>

  <p>"It's my confounded modesty again, Charlie," the boy laughed. "I just
  couldn't stand the limelight. Let me look at the thing, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Charlie handed it over, and Bradshaw examined it carefully in the
  dashboard light. "Mine all right." He pointed at the mark. "That's my alias
  at the laundry. This is pretty sinister, if you ask me."</p>

  <p>Charlie took back the handkerchief. "I have very good notion to put you in
  jail," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"And trifle with the power of the press?" the boy reminded him. "Think
  twice, Charlie. I didn't do away with our distinguished visitor. That's not
  the sort of Hawaiian hospitality I go in for." He hesitated. "I could use
  that handkerchief to-night."</p>

  <p>"So could I," Chan answered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, then I'll just have to drip perspiration on this immortal story
  I'm about to write. So long, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"So long," Chan returned. "And please keep handkerchief out of that same
  story, and out of your conversation, or you will hear from me."</p>

  <p>"O.K., Charlie. It stays a big secret. Nobody in on it but you and
  me&mdash;and the laundry."</p>

  <p class="first">Chan drove slowly on to Kalakaua Hale, at the foot of Bethel
  Street, the home of the police. Parking his car, he ascended the worn stone
  steps. A light was burning in the detectives' room, and going in, he
  encountered his Chief.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Charlie," that gentleman said. "I've been waiting for you. Drove
  over to Kailua to-night, or I'd have been with you down the beach. This is a
  pretty mix-up, isn't it? Got anything yet?"</p>

  <p>Sadly Chan shook his head. He glanced at his watch. "The story has
  length," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Guess I'd better hear it, anyhow," replied the Chief. In him, there was
  no lack of vigor. The ride in the moonlight to Kailua had been restful and
  refreshing.</p>

  <p>Charlie sat down and began to talk, while his Chief listened intently. He
  took up first the scene of the murder, the absence of any weapon, the
  unsuccessful attempt of the murderer to fix the moment of the crime at two
  minutes past eight. Coming to the question of clues, he mentioned the loss of
  the diamond pin which had held the orchids.</p>

  <p>"That's something," nodded the Chief, lighting a cigar.</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "Something we do not possess," he pointed out. He went on
  to repeat Shelah Fane's story of her presence at the murder of Denny
  Mayo&mdash;the tale she had told Tarneverro, according to the fortune-teller,
  that morning.</p>

  <p>"Fine&mdash;fine," cried the Chief. "That gives you the motive, Charlie.
  Now if she had only written down the name, as this Tarneverro wanted her
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With acute distaste, Charlie added the incident of the letter's loss. His
  Chief looked at him with surprise and a marked disapproval.</p>

  <p>"Never knew anything like that to happen to you before. Losing your grip,
  Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"For a moment, I certainly lost grip and letter too," Chan replied
  ruefully. "As the matter turned out, it did not have much importance." His
  face brightened as he added the later discovery of the letter under the rug,
  proving that it was of no value save as a corroboration of Tarneverro's
  story. He went on to the destruction of the portrait over which Shelah Fane
  had been seen weeping bitterly in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Some one didn't want you to see it," frowned the Chief.</p>

  <p>"I arrived at the same deduction myself," Charlie admitted. He pictured
  the arrival of Robert Fyfe on what was obviously his second visit to Waikiki
  within a few hours, and then turned to the subject of the beach-comber.</p>

  <p>"We took his finger-prints and let him go," put in the Chief. "He hasn't
  nerve enough to kill a fly."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "You are no doubt correct in such surmise." His report of
  Fyfe's subsequent, easily punctured confession, evidently puzzled his
  superior. He mentioned the handkerchief with the telltale slivers of glass
  found in Martino's pocket, and Jimmy Bradshaw's somewhat belated claim to its
  ownership. He was by this time rather out of breath. "So matter stands at
  present," he finished.</p>

  <p>His Chief was looking at him with an amused smile. "Well, Charlie,
  sometimes I've thought you weren't entirely satisfied here since your return
  from the mainland," he said. "Pretty quiet, you thought it. No big cases like
  over there. Just chasing a few scared gamblers down an alley&mdash;not very
  thrilling, was it? Honolulu didn't seem to be big enough for you any more. I
  guess it's big enough to-night."</p>

  <p>"I experience uncomfortable feeling maybe it is too big," Chan admitted.
  "How will I come out of this? Considerable puzzle, if inquiry is made of
  me."</p>

  <p>"We mustn't let it stump us," replied the Chief briskly. He was an
  intelligent man, and he knew where to lean. He foresaw that he was going to
  do some heavy leaning in the next few days. With an appraising glance, he
  surveyed his assistant. Charlie looked sleepy and somewhat worn&mdash;nothing
  alert, nothing clever in his appearance now. The Chief consoled himself with
  memories. Chan, he reflected, was ever keener than he looked.</p>

  <p>He considered. "This Tarneverro, Charlie,&mdash;what sort of fellow is
  he?"</p>

  <p>Chan brightened. "Ah, perhaps you go to heart of the matter. Tarneverro
  appears dark as rainy night, but it is his business to act so. He owns a
  quick mind. And he seems fiercely eager to assist poor policeman like
  me."</p>

  <p>"A bit too eager, maybe?"</p>

  <p>Charlie nodded. "I have thought of that. But consider&mdash;he offers to
  produce testimony of old couple with whom he sat until moment murder was
  discovered. Truth of that will be examined to-morrow, but I do not doubt it.
  No&mdash;I am plenty certain he did not visit house of Shelah Fane until I
  took him there. Other points absolve him."</p>

  <p>"What, for example?"</p>

  <p>"I have told you he spoke to me before murder was done, hinting we would
  to-night make arrest in famous case. That would have been strangely foolish
  move if he contemplated murder himself. And Tarneverro is not
  foolish&mdash;he goes far the other way. Then, too, indicating he has earnest
  desire to assist he points out the matter of the watch. It was bright
  act&mdash;not very necessary since I already knew facts from Wu
  Kno-ching&mdash;but all same plenty good proof he sincerely aims to help. No,
  I do not believe him guilty killer, and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet what, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"I prefer to hold that safe in mind for the present. It may mean much, and
  it may mean nothing."</p>

  <p>"You've got something on Tarneverro?" asked the Chief, looking at him
  keenly.</p>

  <p>"With regard to killing&mdash;not one solitary thing. At moment when that
  took place, I believe he was most decidedly elsewhere. Gazing in another
  direction&mdash;kindly permit that I gaze that way a few hours longer before
  I divulge my thoughts." The plump detective put one hand to his head. "Haie,
  just now I wander, lost in maze of doubts and questionings."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to cut that out, Charlie," his Chief told him in a kindly but
  somewhat worried tone. "The honor of the force is at stake. If these people
  are going to come over here to our quiet little city and murder each other at
  Waikiki, we've got to prove to them that they can't get away with it. I rely
  on you."</p>

  <p>Chan bowed. "I'm afraid you do. Appreciate the distinction, and will do
  all my humble talents permit. Now I will wish you good night. The evening has
  worn on me like some prolonged dispute."</p>

  <p>He went out into the battered old hall, just as Spencer entered from the
  street. Chan looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"The Oceanic has sailed?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;she's out."</p>

  <p>"With none of our friends aboard, I trust?" Chan said.</p>

  <p>"None that I saw goin' aboard&mdash;and I guess I was there first. One of
  'em showed up, though."</p>

  <p>"Which one?"</p>

  <p>"That Alan Jaynes. He came in a car from the Grand Hotel, an' collected
  his baggage. I heard him swearin' under his breath when the ship backed away
  from the pier. I helped him load up, an' he went back to the beach. He give
  me a message for you."</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"He said he was sailing on the next ship, and all hell couldn't stop
  him."</p>

  <p>Charlie smiled. "None the less, I shall see that the province he mentions
  breaks loose at the dock if he tries it."</p>

  <p>He went down the flight of steps to the street. Through the moonlight he
  saw approaching him the jaunty figure of Smith, the beach-comber.</p>

  <p>"This is a pretty idea, officer," that gentleman said. "You give me a nice
  ride down to the station, and then you kick me out. How am I going to get
  back to my bedroom? I've walked it once to-night."</p>

  <p>Charlie reached into his pocket and held out one hand in which lay a small
  coin. "You may make the distance by trolley," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Smith looked down at the coin. "A dime," he remarked. "Ten cents. I can't
  get on a street-car and offer the conductor a dime. A gentleman has to have
  the prestige of a dollar."</p>

  <p>Tired as he was, Chan laughed. "So sorry," he answered. "There may be much
  in what you say. But I believe it wiser at this time to proffer you the ride
  and no more. The hour is late, and you should be able to maintain your
  dignity on very little prestige tonight."</p>

  <p>Stubbornly Smith shook his head. "I've got to have the prestige of a
  dollar," he insisted.</p>

  <p>"You mean you've got to have a drink," shrugged Chan. "If the coin is
  unsatisfactory, I regretfully withdraw it." He moved toward his car. "So
  sorry that I travel in opposite direction from your couch beneath the
  palm."</p>

  <p>Smith followed him. "Oh, well," he said, "perhaps I'm a bit too sensitive.
  I'll take the dime." Charlie gave it to him. "Just a loan, Inspector. I'll
  make a note of it."</p>

  <p>He hurried away down Bethel Street in the direction of King. With one foot
  on the running-board of his little car, Charlie stared after him. Finally he
  abandoned the flivver and followed. The empty streets were as bright as day,
  the risk was great, but Chan was an old hand at the game. Smith's battered
  shoes flopped noisily on the deserted sidewalk, but the detective moved as
  though on velvet slippers.</p>

  <p>The beach-comber turned to the right on King Street and, dodging in and
  out of doorways, Chan followed. As his quarry neared the corner of Fort,
  Charlie waited anxiously in a shadowed nook. Would Smith pause at that corner
  for a Waikiki car? If he did, this pursuit came to nothing.</p>

  <p>But Smith did not stop. Instead he crossed over and hastened down Fort
  Street. The moon shone brightly on his enormous flapping hat, on the
  shoulders of his absurd velvet coat. Charlie's interest revived at once. On
  what errand did the beach-comber set forth at this hour of the night?</p>

  <p>Selecting the opposite side of the thoroughfare from that which Smith
  traveled&mdash;it was darker and better suited to his purpose&mdash;Chan
  trailed his man down Fort. Past the principal shops of Honolulu, in each of
  which a dim light burned, they moved along. Smith came to the entrance of the
  Waioli Hotel, and stopped there. Hiding in a dark doorway across the street,
  Chan saw him peer into the hotel lobby. The place was deserted save for a
  watchman who dozed in a chair behind the great glass window. For a moment the
  beach-comber hesitated and then, as though changing his mind, turned and
  retraced his steps. Charlie squeezed his great bulk against the door behind
  him, in a panic lest he be discovered.</p>

  <p>But he was safe. All unsuspecting, Smith hurried back to the corner of
  King, there to await the Waikiki car. Charlie remained in hiding until the
  car arrived. He saw the beachcomber mount to a seat and ride
  away&mdash;without the prestige of a dollar.</p>

  <p>Slowly Chan walked back to the station house. What did this mean?
  Evidently when Robert Fyfe announced his address to the detective, he was
  also proclaiming it to the battered Mr. Smith. And Smith desired to see the
  actor at once, on urgent business.</p>

  <p>Charlie was getting into his flivver when the Chief came down the steps of
  Kalakaua Hale.</p>

  <p>"Thought you'd gone home, Charlie," he said.</p>

  <p>"I was for a moment delayed," Chan explained.</p>

  <p>His superior came up eagerly. "Anything new?"</p>

  <p>"I remain just where I always have been," the detective sighed.</p>

  <p>"You're not really as much in the dark on this case as you say you are?"
  asked the Chief anxiously.</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "The man who sits in a well, sees little of the sky."</p>

  <p>"Well, climb out, Charlie, climb out."</p>

  <p>"I am planning swift ascent," the detective answered, and starting his
  engine, sped off at last in the direction of his house on Punchbowl Hill.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">XII. &mdash; NOBODY'S FOOL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The night was breaking, and a gray mist lay over Waikiki.
  Smith, the beach-comber, shivered slightly and stirred on his bed of sand. He
  put out his hand, as though to draw up over his thin ill-clad body a blanket
  that was not there. Turning over, he muttered in his sleep, then lay
  motionless again.</p>

  <p>The gray mist turned to pink. Above the mountains to the east a small
  segment of sky became a deep gold in color, against which a few scattered
  clouds stood out, black as the recent night. Smith opened his eyes, and
  gradually came back to a recognition of his surroundings. He did not choose
  to sleep on the beach, but for some reason the usual bitterness with which he
  awoke to the realization that he was broke again was missing to-day.
  Something pleasant had happened&mdash;or was about to happen. Ah, yes. He
  smiled at the hau tree above him, and the tree showered him with mahogany-red
  blossoms that had been yellow when he retired for the night. He would have
  preferred grapefruit and coffee, but flowers were more in keeping with the
  scene.</p>

  <p>He sat up. The gold in the eastern sky was spreading, and now the rim of
  the sun appeared. The snow-white beach was lapped by water that had in it a
  glint of gold to match the sky. At his left stood Diamond Head, that extinct
  volcano. He had always a sort of fellow feeling for Diamond Head, being a bit
  on the extinct side himself. His mind went back to the events of the
  preceding night. Good fortune had taken him by the hand and led him to that
  pavilion window. Too often in these last years he had been blind to
  opportunity. He was resolved that he would not be blind now.</p>

  <p>He got to his feet and, removing his scanty clothing, revealed underneath
  a frayed pair of bathing trunks. Gathering all his courage, he ran down to
  the water and plunged in. The shock revivified him. He struck out boldly; one
  thing at least he had learned on tropic beaches, and that was the art of the
  swimmer. As he cut through the water the wasted years fell away from him; old
  ambitions returned; he made plans for the future. He would win back to his
  former self; he would leave this languorous spot where he had never intended
  to stay anyhow; he would be a man again. The money that would put his feet
  back on the highroad was finally within his grasp.</p>

  <p>The sun, warm and friendly, crept up the eastern sky. Smith plunged far
  under the waves, swam there, felt more energetic with every exploit. Finally
  he returned to shallow water, and walking carefully to avoid the coral, came
  from his bath back to his bedroom. For a time he sat, leaning against the
  abandoned hulk of a boat in the shelter of which he had spent the night. The
  hot sun served as his towel, and he rested, at peace with the world. A
  delicious feeling of laziness spread over him. But no, no&mdash;this wouldn't
  do.</p>

  <p>He donned his clothes, took a broken piece of comb from his pocket, and
  applied it to his yellow beard and hair. His toilet was completed, and
  breakfast was now the order of the day. Above him hung clusters of coconuts;
  often these had been forced to serve. But not this morning, he told himself
  with a smile. Through a scene of brightness and beauty, he walked slowly
  toward the Moana Hotel. It was a scene that had, in its way, contributed to
  Mr. Smith's downfall, for every time he sought to paint it, he threw down his
  brush in disgust and bemoaned the inadequacy of his talent.</p>

  <p>On the sand outside the hotel, an early beach-boy lay strumming a steel
  guitar and singing a gentle song. Smith went promptly to join him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Frank," he said.</p>

  <p>Frank turned his head. "Hello," he answered dreamily. The beach-comber sat
  down beside him. Suddenly Frank looked at him, his dark eyes wide and
  earnest. "I'm not going to sing for tourists to-day," the beach-boy
  announced. "I'm just going to sing for the blue sky."</p>

  <p>Smith nodded. Coming from any other race, this would have been a stilted
  and theatrical remark, but the beachcomber knew his Hawaiians better than
  that. He had watched them arrive each morning on their beloved beach, staring
  at it as though its beauty were brought to their attention for the first
  time, diving into its familiar waters with cries of delight that betokened a
  happiness rare in this modern world.</p>

  <p>"That's the ticket," Frank Smith nodded approvingly. He suddenly
  introduced a more practical note. "Got any money?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>The boy frowned. What was this money all the haoles seemed so interested
  in, so vocal about? It meant nothing to him, and never would.</p>

  <p>"I guess so," he replied casually. "Dollar in my coat, I think."</p>

  <p>Smith's eyes glittered. "Lend it to me. I'll pay it back before night. All
  the rest I owe you, too. How much do I owe you, anyhow?"</p>

  <p>"Can't remember," Frank answered, and sang again.</p>

  <p>"I'll have lots of money before the day's out," Smith continued, a note of
  excitement in his voice.</p>

  <p>Frank sang softly. A queer thing to get excited about, money, when the sky
  was so blue, the water so warm, and there was such a deep satisfaction just
  in lying on the white beach and humming a song.</p>

  <p>"In your coat, you say?" Smith persisted.</p>

  <p>Frank nodded. "Go and get it. The locker door's open."</p>

  <p>Smith went at once. When he returned he held a dollar bill in one hand,
  and in the other a small canvas.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking that picture I left with you, Frank," he explained. "Something
  tells me there's a market for my work at last." He stared at the painting
  critically. A dark-skinned, black-eyed girl stood against a background of
  cool green. She held a crimson flower between her lips, and she had the look
  of the tropics, of lazy islands lost in southern seas. "You know," the
  beach-comber added with almost reluctant admiration, "that's not half
  bad."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said Frank.</p>

  <p>"Not bad at all," Smith continued. "But then, they told me I had talent,
  Frank. I heard it in New York&mdash;and in Paris too. Talent&mdash;maybe a
  touch of genius&mdash;but not much else. No backbone&mdash;no
  character&mdash;nothing to back it up. You've got to have character, my
  boy."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," repeated Frank idly.</p>

  <p>"You know, Frank, painters without half my skill&mdash;oh, hell, what's
  the use? Why should I complain? Look at Corot, Frank. Not one of his pictures
  was sold during his lifetime. Look at Manet. You know what the critics did to
  Manet? They laughed at him."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," continued Frank. He threw down his guitar, leaped to his feet and,
  running across the sand, dove like a fish into two feet of water. Smith
  looked after him. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No interest in painting," he muttered. "Just music. Well, that's
  something." He put the bill in his pocket, tucked the canvas under his arm,
  and went out to the street.</p>

  <p>A trolley was approaching, bound for the city, and Smith swung aboard. He
  offered the dollar proudly&mdash;after this, perhaps, the conductor would not
  judge every one by his clothes. Once or twice, on the way into town, he
  looked again at his painting. His opinion of it grew even better.</p>

  <p>At a lunch room in town he treated himself to a breakfast such as he had
  not known in several days, then moved on to the Waioli Hotel. His entrance
  there evoked no great enthusiasm. The clerk stared at him with open
  disapproval. "What do you want?" he inquired coldly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Fyfe stopping here?" the beach-comber asked.</p>

  <p>"He is&mdash;but he sleeps late. I can't disturb him."</p>

  <p>"You'd better disturb him." There was a sudden note of authority in
  Smith's voice. "I've an appointment&mdash;very important. Mr. Fyfe wants to
  see me more than I want to see him."</p>

  <p>The clerk hesitated, and then took up a telephone. In a moment he turned
  to the beach-comber. "Be down right away," he announced.</p>

  <p>Boldly Smith dropped into a chair and waited. Fyfe appeared almost at
  once; evidently he had not slept late today. There was a worried look in his
  eyes. He came over to the beach-comber. "You wanted to see me?" he said. "I'm
  on my way to the theater. Come along."</p>

  <p>He left his key at the desk and strode toward the door, Smith struggling
  to keep up with him. They walked in silence. Finally the actor turned.</p>

  <p>"Why be so indiscreet?" he inquired. "You could have telephoned me and I'd
  have met you."</p>

  <p>Smith shrugged. "Telephoning costs money," he replied. "And I haven't much
  money&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>There was a world of meaning in that last word. Fyfe led the way from the
  more modern quarter of the city into the oriental district. They moved on
  past shops crammed with silks, linens, embroideries, jade and porcelains.
  Bales and baskets filled with the foodstuffs of the orient encroached upon
  the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"I take it you expect to have money soon?" Fyfe said at last.</p>

  <p>Smith smiled. "Why not? Last night I did you a favor. Oh&mdash;I'm
  nobody's fool. I know why you made that fake confession. You were afraid I
  was going to repeat what I heard when I was standing outside that window.
  Weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Just what did you overhear?"</p>

  <p>"Enough, believe me. I heard that woman&mdash;the woman somebody killed
  later on&mdash;I heard her tell you that she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind!" The actor looked nervously about. Nothing but flat
  expressionless faces, dark eyes that avoided his.</p>

  <p>"I think I fell in with your plan very neatly," Smith reminded him. "When
  that Chinese detective, after he'd punctured your confession, asked me again
  what I'd heard&mdash;well, I said what you wanted me to, didn't I? I backed
  up what you'd been saying. I could have exploded a bomb right then and
  there&mdash;but I didn't. Please remember that."</p>

  <p>"I do remember it. And I rather expected you'd be around this morning to
  blackmail me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir"&mdash;Smith raised a thin freckled hand&mdash;"you might
  have spared me that. I have some shreds of respectability left,
  and&mdash;er&mdash;what you said is scarcely in my line. It just occurred to
  me that as an intelligent man, a practitioner of one of the allied arts, you
  might possibly be interested in my work." He indicated the canvas. "I happen
  to have a sample with me," he added brightly.</p>

  <p>Fyfe laughed. "You're a rather subtle person, Mr. Smith. Suppose I did buy
  one of your paintings&mdash;what would you do with the money?"</p>

  <p>Smith licked his lips. "I'd get out of this place for ever. I'm fed up
  here. For the past year I've been thinking about going home&mdash;to my folks
  in Cleveland. I don't know whether they'd be glad to see me&mdash;if I had
  decent clothes and a bit of money in my pocket&mdash;that might help."</p>

  <p>"How did you get here in the first place?" the actor inquired.</p>

  <p>"I went down to the South Seas to paint. Might be a good place for some
  people&mdash;but for me&mdash;well, the first thing I knew I was on the
  beach. After a long time, my people sent me money to come home. I managed to
  get aboard a boat, but unfortunately it stopped for a day at this port.
  And&mdash;have you tried any of the okolehau they call a drink in this
  paradise?"</p>

  <p>Fyfe smiled. "I understand. You forgot to go back to your ship."</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," Smith shrugged, "I forgot the world. When I woke up, my
  boat was two days out. Oddly enough, my father seemed annoyed. A rather
  impatient man."</p>

  <p>They reached the river and, crossing a narrow stone bridge, entered Aala
  Park where, because of its convenient location, the dregs of the town
  congregate. Fyfe indicated a bench. They sat down together, and Smith handed
  over his canvas.</p>

  <p>The actor glanced at it, and a look of surprise crossed his face. "By
  jove," he cried, "that's damned good."</p>

  <p>"Glad to hear you say so," beamed Smith. "A bit unexpected, too, eh? I'm
  not what you'd call a born salesman, but I can't help pointing out that the
  thing might be valuable some day. There's just a chance. Think of the pride
  you could take in saying to your friends: 'Ah, yes&mdash;but I recognized his
  talent long ago. I was his first patron.'"</p>

  <p>"Is this your real name&mdash;down here in the corner?"</p>

  <p>The beach-comber hung his head. "My real name&mdash;yes," he replied.</p>

  <p>Fyfe laid the canvas on his knee. "Just&mdash;what is the price?" he
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"What am I offered?" Smith countered.</p>

  <p>"If you're really sincere about wanting to go home," said the actor, "I'll
  be happy to arrange it for you. Not now, of course&mdash;the police wouldn't
  let you go at present. But when this has blown over a bit, I'll buy you a
  ticket&mdash;and give you something besides. In return for this canvas, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"How much besides?"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred dollars."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Make it two fifty. Look here, you're not dealing with a millionaire. I'm
  an actor on a salary, and it's none too big. I've had a long engagement in
  Honolulu, and I've saved a bit. I'm offering you about all I've got. If it's
  not enough, I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"It's enough," said the beach-comber slowly. "I don't mean to be hard on
  you. I'm not very proud of this, you know. But it's my chance&mdash;my chance
  to get away&mdash;lord, I've got to take it. We'll call it a bargain&mdash;a
  ticket to the mainland as soon as they'll let me go, and two fifty in my
  jeans. But say&mdash;how about meantime&mdash;I need a small advance
  now."</p>

  <p>"For okolehau, eh?"</p>

  <p>Smith hesitated. "I don't know," he said frankly. "I hope not. I don't
  want to touch it. I might talk, and spoil everything. I'm not thinking so
  much of you&mdash;spoil everything for myself, I mean." He stood up. "I won't
  touch it," he cried suddenly. "I'll fight, and I'll win. I give you my word
  of honor as a gentleman."</p>

  <p>Fyfe looked him over, wondering what that was worth. He took out his
  wallet.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to trust you, I suppose. I'll give you fifty now." Smith's eyes
  gleamed. "It's all I've got on me. Wait a minute!" He pushed away the
  beach-comber's eager hand. "Remember&mdash;you must be careful. If the police
  find that you've suddenly got money, they're bound to look into it."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of some new clothes," returned Smith wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Not now," Fyfe warned. "Before you sail, yes&mdash;we'll attend to that.
  But now&mdash;just as you are for a while&mdash;and lie low." The actor was
  standing too, and he stared hard into the other's face. "I'm depending on
  you. A man who can paint as you can&mdash;don't be a fool. Go straight."</p>

  <p>"By heaven, I will!" Smith cried, and hurried off across the park. For a
  moment Fyfe looked after him, then, with his recent purchase under his arm,
  walked slowly in the direction of the theater.</p>

  <p>Smith went on to Beretania Street, and entered a small low-ceilinged room
  through a doorway that bore above it the faint sign: "Nippon Hotel." Behind
  the narrow desk stood a polite little Japanese. On the wall at his back hung
  the picture of a great liner cleaving the waves, under the words: "Nippon
  Yusen Kaisha."</p>

  <p>"Hello, Nada," Smith said jauntily. "My old room vacant?"</p>

  <p>"So sorry," hissed the Jap.</p>

  <p>Smith threw a bill on to the counter. "Here's ten in advance," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"So sorry you stay away such long time," hastily amended the clerk. "Room
  all ready&mdash;yes-s."</p>

  <p>"I'll go and brush up a bit," Smith told him. "My baggage will be along
  later."</p>

  <p>"You have money from home, I think," Nada smiled.</p>

  <p>"Money from home, nothing," Smith responded airily. "I've sold a picture,
  Nada. You know, that's more than Corot ever did." He leaned across the
  counter confidentially. "Poor old Corot, Nada, never got on to himself. It's
  all in being outside the right window at the right time."</p>

  <p>"Mebbe so," agreed Nada. "Much better you go along now. Room numba seven,
  like always."</p>

  <p>"It's great to be home," Smith answered, and went out, whistling a merry
  tune.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">XIII. &mdash; BREAKFAST WITH THE CHANS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">An hour after Smith took his morning swim, Charlie Chan rose
  and, stepping to his bedroom window, looked down on the bright panorama of
  town and sea. From Punchbowl Hill the view was one to stir the heart with
  beauty: green valleys and gleaming water, at this season the crimson
  umbrellas of the poinciana, golden shower trees blooming in generous
  profusion, here and there a brick-red bougainvillea vine. Charlie's lot was
  cast in a pleasant setting, and he loved to stand thus on a morning and
  reflect on his good fortune.</p>

  <p>To-day, however, he preferred to reflect on the problem that lay before
  him. Insoluble it had appeared when he went to bed, but he had slept soundly
  in the knowledge that what is to be will be, and now he felt a new energy
  stirring within him. Was he, then, a mainland policeman to be stumped and
  helpless in the face of a question that had, no doubt, some simple answer? It
  was a matter, however, that called for prompt and intelligent action on his
  part. He thought of the crane who, waiting for the sea to disappear and leave
  him dry fish to eat, died of starvation. Chan had no intention of emulating
  that stupid bird.</p>

  <p>It was a far from silent house that lay about him. Eleven children in one
  family make of early morning something of a bedlam. He heard their voices
  here, there and all about, shouting, expostulating, laughing and, in one case
  at least, weeping bitterly. With a comfortable feeling that the day had begun
  as usual, he prepared himself for his tasks.</p>

  <p>In the dining-room he found that his three eldest children were lingering
  about the table, and as he entered, he saw them regarding him with a keen
  interest he had not aroused in that quarter for a long time. They all spoke
  at once, and he realized the cause of their interest. One of their heroines,
  according to the morning paper, was murdered, and they were going to see the
  miscreant punished or know the reason why.</p>

  <p>"Quiet!" Charlie cried. "Can a man think beneath a tree filled with myna
  birds?" He turned to his oldest son, Henry, dapper in college-cut clothes and
  engaged in lighting a cigarette. "You should be at the store."</p>

  <p>"Going right along, Dad," Henry replied. "But say&mdash;what's all this
  about Shelah Fane?"</p>

  <p>"You have read it in the paper. Some one most unkindly stabbed her. Now,
  get on to your work."</p>

  <p>"Who did it?" said Rose, the oldest girl. "That's what we want to
  know."</p>

  <p>"A few others languish in same fix," her father admitted.</p>

  <p>"You're on the case, aren't you, Dad?" Henry inquired.</p>

  <p>Charlie looked at him. "In Honolulu, who else would be summoned?" he asked
  blandly.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the dope?" went on Henry, who had been Americanized to a
  rather painful extent. "When do you grab the guilty party, and what's his
  name?"</p>

  <p>Charlie again looked at him, and sighed. These children were his link with
  the future&mdash;what sort of future, he often wondered.</p>

  <p>"As I have frequent reason to point out, your language is sadly lacking in
  dignity," he reproved. "I have not yet apprehended the wrong-doer, and as a
  consequence, I do not know his name."</p>

  <p>"But you will, won't you, Dad?" Rose put in. "You're not going to fall
  down on it, are you?"</p>

  <p>"When have I ever so much as stumbled?" he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>She was smiling at him mischievously. "Now, Dad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When I was youthful," Chan broke in hastily, "it was regarded deadly sin
  to question all-pervading wisdom of father. He was honored and respected by
  children. Such a hint of failure as you have just offered would have been
  impossible."</p>

  <p>She got up and came round to him, still smiling. "Times have changed.
  You're not going to fail, of course. We all know that. But this is one case
  your family is really interested in. So move fast, won't you? Don't take too
  much time out for oriental meditation."</p>

  <p>"Should I pause to think deeply," he replied, "I would be plenty lonesome
  man in this new world."</p>

  <p>Rose kissed him and went out on her way to the bank where she was employed
  during the summer vacation. Henry stood up languidly.</p>

  <p>"Will you be wanting the car to-night, Dad?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"If I ever wanted it, to-night will be the time," his father answered.</p>

  <p>Henry frowned. "I guess I'll have to buy one," he said. "I can get a good
  second-hand bus on the installment plan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie shook his head. "Work&mdash;and pay your way as you go," he
  advised. "Then you need fear no midnight knock upon the door."</p>

  <p>"Old stuff," replied Henry, and made a leisurely exit.</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged, and attacked his breakfast. Evelyn, aged fifteen, was
  addressing him. "Gee&mdash;I thought Shelah Fane was swell. I saw her in some
  swell parts."</p>

  <p>"Enough!" cried Charlie. "Vast English language is spread out before you,
  and you select for your use the lowliest words. I am discouraged."</p>

  <p>His wife appeared with his oatmeal and the tea. She was a jolly-looking
  woman, nearly as broad as Chan, with a placid smiling face. If her children
  and her husband had far outdistanced her in the matter of adjustment to a new
  land, she was, judging from her calm eyes, not at all distressed. "Heah about
  Shelah Fane," she remarked. "Plitty tellible thing."</p>

  <p>"What do you know about Shelah Fane?" Charlie asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>"All time chillun make talk, Shelah Fane, Shelah Fane," his wife said. "I
  think mus' be velly fine woman. I want you catch bad man plenty quick."</p>

  <p>Chan choked on his hot tea. "If I do not, I perceive I am expelled from my
  own household. May I respectfully ask that you give me time. Much work to be
  done on this case."</p>

  <p>"Mebbe you have moah tea," his wife suggested.</p>

  <p>He drank a second cup, and then rose from the table. Evelyn brought his
  hat; they all seemed eager to speed him on his way. At the door he barely
  avoided falling over a round-faced little boy with keen black eyes that
  recalled those of his father. "Ah&mdash;the small Barry." He lifted the child
  and gave him an affectionate kiss. "Every day you grow more handsome, like
  fine namesake, Mr. Barry Kirk. Be good boy, now, and do not eat the
  plaster."</p>

  <p>He went out and got his car, and as he drove down the hill he thought
  about his children. He had always been proud of the fact that they were all
  American citizens. But, perhaps because of this very fact, they seemed to be
  growing away from him&mdash;the gulf widened daily. They made no effort to
  remember the precepts and the odes; they spoke the English language in a
  manner that grated on Charlie's sensitive ear.</p>

  <p>He passed the Chinese cemetery, with its odd headstones scattered down the
  sloping hillside. There lay his mother, whom he had brought from China to
  spend her last years in the house on Punchbowl Hill. What would she think if
  she could see her descendants now: see Henry in his dapper clothes; see Rose,
  brisk and efficient, planning to go to a university on the mainland in the
  autumn; hear Evelyn speaking that shabby, out-moded slang she picked up on
  the school grounds? His mother would not have approved, Charlie knew. She
  would have mourned for the old ways, the old customs. He mourned for them
  himself&mdash;but there was nothing he could do about it.</p>

  <p>Reaching the business district of the city, he turned his attention to the
  tasks that lay before him. These were many, and he planned in what order he
  should attack them. Robert Fyfe was uppermost in his thoughts, so he drove at
  once to the Waioli Hotel.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fyfe, the clerk said, had gone out with a man. What man? The
  description left no doubt as to the identity of Fyfe's caller, and Charlie
  frowned. What did Smith want of the actor? What had he overheard when he
  stood outside that pavilion window? Why had Fyfe confessed to a crime he had
  not committed? He couldn't have committed it, obviously. Not if his story of
  his actions on the previous night was correct&mdash;ah, yes, Charlie
  reflected, he must look into that.</p>

  <p>"I think I heard Mr. Fyfe say he was going to the theater," the clerk
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Chan was not up on the drama. "What theater, please?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"The Royal," the clerk told him, and Charlie went there.</p>

  <p>He entered from the street, passing from a tiled lobby into the dark
  auditorium. On the stage the members of the stock company were rehearsing
  next week's piece. A few old kitchen chairs represented exits and entrances,
  and the players stood about, waiting for their cues. At the moment Fyfe was
  delivering a long speech; he gave it languidly, as though it were something
  with which he had no personal concern.</p>

  <p>Charlie walked down the dim aisle. A man with a green velour hat pulled
  low over his eyes, who sat at a small table on the stage with the play script
  in his hand, looked down at the detective with evident annoyance. "What do
  you want?" he barked.</p>

  <p>"Just one word, please, with Mr. Fyfe," Chan replied.</p>

  <p>The actor stepped forward and, shading his eyes from the glare of the
  footlights, peered into the auditorium.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;Inspector Chan," he said. "Won't you come up, please?"</p>

  <p>Panting from the effort, Charlie boosted his heavy bulk on to the
  stage.</p>

  <p>Fyfe was smiling and cordial. "What can I do for you this morning,
  Inspector?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Charlie regarded him through half-shut eyes. "Not much, I fear, unless
  maybe mood has altered overnight. You will recall I arranged for you,
  somewhat against your wish, a very nice alibi. I am here now to verify
  myself. A mere matter of form."</p>

  <p>"Surely," nodded Fyfe. "Oh, Wayne," he called. Reluctantly the man in the
  green hat got up and came over to them. "This is Mr. Wayne, our stage
  manager&mdash;Inspector Chan, of the Honolulu police. The Inspector is here
  regarding that affair last night. Wayne&mdash;what time was it when you rang
  up last evening?"</p>

  <p>"Eight-twenty," growled Wayne. "Five minutes late."</p>

  <p>"I was standing beside you when you rang up?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you were. Though where you were when we were hammering on your
  door, I'm damned if I know."</p>

  <p>"The Inspector, however, does," Fyfe returned. "Was that all you wanted,
  Mr. Chan?"</p>

  <p>"One other thing." Chan addressed the stage manager. "In play which you
  perform this present week, does Mr. Fyfe in actor capacity indulge in use of
  knife?"</p>

  <p>"A knife?" repeated Wayne. "Why, no&mdash;there's no knife in this play.
  It's a polite drawing-room comedy."</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much," Charlie said, bowing. "That is all." He turned on
  Robert Fyfe a speculative eye. "Will you come with me, please?"</p>

  <p>He led the way down into the auditorium, thinking deeply as he did so.
  Shelah Fane was seen alive at eight-twelve. Robert Fyfe was in the wings of
  the theater, ready to go on, at eight-twenty. Just eight minutes&mdash;no one
  could possibly travel the distance from Waikiki to town in that time. Fyfe's
  alibi was perfect. And yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the darkened foyer back of the last row Charlie paused, and the two
  leaned on the rail.</p>

  <p>"I am still wondering, Mr. Fyfe," the detective remarked, "why you made
  false confession that you killed Shelah Fane."</p>

  <p>"I'm inclined to wonder a bit myself, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"Obviously you did not kill her."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you must think me a fool," Fyfe said.</p>

  <p>"Other way about, I think you very smart man."</p>

  <p>"Do you, really? That's flattering, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"There was reason for that confession, Mr. Fyfe."</p>

  <p>"If there was, it has quite escaped my memory at this time,
  Inspector."</p>

  <p>"Much better you tell me. Otherwise you place obstacle in path of
  justice."</p>

  <p>"I must be the judge of that, Mr. Chan. I do not wish to hinder you. On
  the contrary I am eager for your success."</p>

  <p>"Under such a circumstance, I find that difficult to believe." Chan was
  silent for a moment. "You have seen our friend the beach-comber this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>Fyfe hesitated. He regretted more than ever the public nature of his
  meeting with Smith. Then he threw back his head and laughed&mdash;a laugh too
  long delayed, as Charlie noted.</p>

  <p>"I certainly have," the actor admitted. "He called on me almost before I
  was up."</p>

  <p>"For what purpose?"</p>

  <p>"To get money, of course. I imagine he is making the rounds of the people
  he met last night. He seemed to think that the mere meeting gave him a sort
  of claim on us all."</p>

  <p>"You are too busy with plural words," Chan protested. "His claim, I think,
  was on you alone." The actor said nothing. "You gave him money?" Charlie
  persisted.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes&mdash;a few dollars. I was rather sorry for him. He is not
  a bad painter&mdash;" Fyfe stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"How do you know he is not a bad painter?" Chan was quick to ask.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;he&mdash;he left a canvas with me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This canvas?" Charlie stepped down the aisle, and picked up something
  from a vacant seat. "I noted it as we came back here together," he explained.
  "If you do not mind, I will take it to light and examine it."</p>

  <p>"By all means," the actor agreed.</p>

  <p>Charlie walked to the door, and pushing it open, gazed for a moment at the
  painting. The eyes of that girl, posed against green shrubbery, seemed
  strangely alive. He came back to Fyfe's side.</p>

  <p>"You are correct," he remarked, dropping the canvas into one of the
  chairs. "The man has talent. Pity such a one must resort
  to&mdash;blackmail."</p>

  <p>"Who said it was blackmail?" demanded Fyfe.</p>

  <p>"I say so. Mr. Fyfe, I could place you beneath arrest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Isn't my alibi satisfactory?"</p>

  <p>"Quite. But you hamper my work. For the last time&mdash;what was it Smith,
  the beach-comber, heard your ex-wife say to you?"</p>

  <p>The stage manager came to the footlights, and called.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry," said Fyfe, "but I'm keeping the company. I really must go
  along&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "The inquiry is young, as yet. Before I am through, I will
  know, Mr. Fyfe."</p>

  <p>"Drop in any time," said Fyfe blandly, holding out his hand. "Too bad I
  must leave you now, but an actor's life, you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chan gravely shook hands, and the actor hurried up the aisle. As he
  returned to the bright street, Charlie wore a puzzled frown. He knew that
  behind Fyfe's suave manner there lurked something of vital
  importance&mdash;something that might, indeed, solve his problem. Yet he
  would never get it from Fyfe. The beachcomber&mdash;ah, perhaps. He made a
  mental note of the beach-comber.</p>

  <p>Climbing back into his flivver, Chan drove over to King Street and turned
  in the direction of Waikiki. As he passed the public library, set well back
  from the street amid great trees, he was tempted to stop. It occurred to him
  that he ought to read, in a Los Angeles paper, the story of Denny Mayo's
  murder. Buried in the yellowed columns describing that spectacular moment in
  the movie colony's history, he might discover a line that would at once put
  him on the true scent in his search for Shelah Fane's assailant.</p>

  <p>With quick decision he swung about and returned to the library. In another
  moment, he was addressing the woman at the library desk.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that I obtain at once Los Angeles paper for June, three
  years ago?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mr. Chan," she answered. "Just fill out the card."</p>

  <p>He filled it hastily, and saw it passed to a young assistant. The girl
  started to move toward the files, glancing at the card as she did so. She
  turned and came back.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "I just happened to remember. That volume of the
  Los Angeles Times is in use just now."</p>

  <p>"In use?" Chan was surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes. A gentleman took it out half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Can you describe this gentleman?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded toward the reading-room. "He's still there. By that
  farther window."</p>

  <p>Chan went over and peered round the corner of a bookcase. Seated bent over
  a huge gray-bound volume, he saw Huntley Van Horn. The picture actor did not
  look up; he seemed grimly intent on what he was doing. With a gesture toward
  the desk, meant to convey the fact that he dropped the whole matter, Chan
  walked softly out of the building.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">XIV. &mdash; THE PAVILION WINDOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Charlie went to the street, got into his flivver, and in
  another moment was traveling rapidly toward Waikiki. It was good to feel the
  faithful little car shuddering under him again; so often in the past it had
  carried him along on the trail of innumerable clues. Many of these clues had
  led him, as he put it, "into presence of immovable stone wall." Thereupon he
  had swung the car about, seeking a new road. And the road that ended in
  victory had, in most cases, stretched before him at last.</p>

  <p>As he sped through the brilliant morning, he thought of Huntley Van Horn.
  He pictured the cinema actor on the night before, walking across the lawn at
  the very moment when the black camel must have been kneeling at Shelah Fane's
  gate. No one was with the actor, no one saw him; he could easily have stepped
  into the pavilion, silenced the woman for ever and then calmly joined the two
  people on the beach.</p>

  <p>What sort of man was Van Horn? Charlie wished he had read a few of the
  movie gossip magazines his children were always bringing into the house. Not
  the sleek, pretty boy type of film favorite, that was evident. Cynical,
  aloof, well-poised, he was the type who could keep his own counsel and turn
  an expressionless face on any one who sought to pry into his affairs. Ah,
  yes&mdash;Mr. Van Horn would bear thinking about. Such thinking might yield a
  rich reward.</p>

  <p>But it was not with Van Horn that Chan was immediately concerned. He was
  on Kalakaua Avenue now, and though the sun was still shining above him, he
  had entered a zone where rain was falling. He saw, as he approached the
  hotels, tourists who wore rain-coats and carried umbrellas; evidently they
  took this liquid sunshine with a seriousness that amused a kamaaina like
  Charlie. He turned sharply to the right and, moving on past the lovely
  gardens of the Grand Hotel, parked his car in the drive at the rear. Walking
  unconcerned through the drizzle, he went over and ascended the hotel
  steps.</p>

  <p>The head bell-man, a Chinese boy with a winning smile, greeted him in
  Cantonese. Chan paused to chat for a moment. No, he explained, he was not
  looking for any one in particular; he would, with kind permission, stroll
  about a bit. He crossed the high cool lobby, returning the jovial greeting of
  a young assistant manager.</p>

  <p>He walked down the long corridor, toward the lounge. Unlike many of his
  fellow citizens of Honolulu, he had no feeling of somewhat resentful awe in
  this impressive interior. Having been to the mainland he regarded himself as
  a traveled man, a judge of hotels, and he approved heartily of this recent
  addition to the charms of Waikiki. He nodded affably at the flower girl, and
  stood for a moment in the entrance to the lounge. This room always inspired
  him. Through the great archways opening on the terrace he caught the shimmer
  of the sea, breathtaking fragments of a scene no coast in the world can
  surpass.</p>

  <p>The huge room was empty of guests, but a few silent oriental servants were
  busy arranging the floral decorations for the day. On tiny slivers of bamboo
  stuck in bowls of sand, they mounted innumerable hibiscus flowers, beautiful
  and fragile blossoms that would fade when evening came. Chan passed through
  to the terrace facing the ocean, and luck was with him. The only occupants of
  the place at that moment were the two old people with whom he had seen
  Tarneverro talking the previous evening. He stepped over to the Hongkong
  chairs where they sat, and stood looking down at them. The man put aside his
  morning paper; the woman glanced up from her book.</p>

  <p>Chan bowed low. "May I wish you good morning," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, sir," the old man replied courteously. There was a pleasant
  Scotch burr to his words, and his face, lined by hard work under a hot sun,
  was as honest as any Charlie had ever seen.</p>

  <p>Chan pushed back his coat. "I am Inspector Chan of the Honolulu police.
  You have, I think, perused in the morning paper story of quick finish of
  noted actress. I am sorry to intrude my inspeakable presence between you and
  this charming view, but gentleman you know was friend of the departed lady.
  It therefore becomes inevitable that I speak to you for short moment."</p>

  <p>"Happy to meet you," said the old gentleman. He rose, and pulled up a
  chair. "Be seated, Inspector. I am Thomas MacMaster, of Queensland,
  Australia, and this is Mrs. MacMaster."</p>

  <p>Chan achieved a notable bow, and the old lady gave him a quick kindly
  smile. A bit of idle chatter seemed in order.</p>

  <p>"You are enjoying nice holiday?" the detective inquired.</p>

  <p>"That we are," returned MacMaster. "And we've earned it, eh, Mother? Aye,
  after long years on a sheep ranch, we're off to revisit old Scotland at last.
  A very leisurely journey, Inspector; we mean to miss nothing along the way.
  And delighted we are"&mdash;he waved toward the beach&mdash;"that we did not
  miss this bonny spot."</p>

  <p>His wife nodded. "Aye, bonny it is. We're very much afraid we'll no have
  the strength of character to move on."</p>

  <p>"Speak for yourself, Mother," MacMaster said. "When the moment comes, I'm
  sure I'll have strength for two. Do not forget that Aberdeen is waiting."</p>

  <p>"In behalf of Honolulu," beamed Chan, "my warmest thanks for all these
  treasured compliments. I recognize they come from honest lips, and my heart
  feels itself deeply touched. But reluctantly I must approach subject of last
  night's homicide. May I open my remarks by pointing out that some
  malihini&mdash;some stranger&mdash;must be responsible for this cruel event?
  Here people are kind, like climate. We seldom murder," he added
  feelingly.</p>

  <p>"Of course," murmured the old lady.</p>

  <p>Looking up, Charlie saw Tarneverro in the doorway. The fortune-teller's
  dark face lighted with satisfaction when he saw the group on the terrace, and
  he came rapidly down the steps. Chan sighed. He would have preferred to do
  this thing himself.</p>

  <p>"Ah, good morning, Inspector," Tarneverro said. "Good morning, Mrs.
  MacMaster. And how are you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"A wee bit lost," answered the old man. "I can not feel just right and not
  be at my work. But Mother tells me I must learn to rest."</p>

  <p>"You certainly must&mdash;you have it coming to you," Tarneverro smiled.
  "Inspector, I am happy to see you on the job at this early hour. You are no
  doubt here to verify my alibi, and that is quite fitting and proper. Have you
  asked these two friends of mine the important question?"</p>

  <p>"I was approaching it with suitable preparation."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," the fortune-teller continued. "Mr. MacMaster, in the matter of
  that unfortunate affair last night&mdash;I happen to have been one of the few
  people in the Islands acquainted with the poor girl, and it is important that
  I establish to the Inspector's satisfaction the fact that I was elsewhere at
  the moment of her death. Luckily I can establish it&mdash;with your help." He
  turned to Charlie. "After I left you in the lounge last night, you saw me
  return to my conversation with Mr. and Mrs. MacMaster. Mr. MacMaster will
  tell you what happened after that."</p>

  <p>The old man frowned thoughtfully. "Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Tarneverro suggested
  that we go out on the veranda&mdash;I believe you call it a lanai&mdash;that
  looks across the palm court. We did so, and for the matter of a half-hour sat
  talking about the old days in Queensland. Finally Mr. Tarneverro had a look
  at his watch. He said it was thirty minutes after eight and that he must
  leave us, as he had a dinner engagement down the beach. We stood
  up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Begging humblest pardon," Chan cut in, "did you by any chance consult own
  timepiece?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, that I did," returned the old man. His manner was very earnest and
  there was an unmistakable ring of truth to his words. "I took out my
  watch&mdash;" He removed an old-fashioned timepiece from his pocket. "'I'm a
  wee bit fast,' I said. 'Eight-thirty-five, I make it. Mother, it's time old
  folks like us went up-stairs.' You see, on the ranch we were always early
  abed, and well-established habits are hard to break. So we came into the
  hotel. Mother and I stopped at the elevators, and Mr. Tarneverro went round
  the corner to his own room on the first floor. While we waited for the lift,
  I stepped to the desk to set my watch the correct time. Eight-thirty-two it
  was then, and I made the change. Those are the facts, Inspector, and Mother
  and I will swear to them."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "The speech of some is like wind in empty space," he said.
  "But blind man could see your word is good."</p>

  <p>"Aye, it always has been. From Aberdeen to Queensland no one has ever
  questioned it, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"You have known Mr. Tarneverro long time?" Charlie asked.</p>

  <p>Tarneverro answered. "Ten years ago," he remarked, "I was playing in a
  Melbourne theater. I was an actor in those days, you know. Our company
  stranded, and I went out to Mr. MacMaster's ranch, a few miles from Brisbane
  to work for him. I stayed a year&mdash;the happiest year of my life. For as
  you may see by looking at them, these two are the kindest people in the
  world, and they were like father and mother to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We did nothing," the old lady protested. "It was a joy to have you
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Alone and lonely as I was," Tarneverro interrupted, "it was great luck to
  come upon people like these. You can imagine my delight when I ran across
  them again at this hotel the other day." He rose. "I take it that is all you
  wanted to know, Mr. Chan. I'd like to have a talk with you."</p>

  <p>"That is all," remarked Chan, rising too. "Lady,&mdash;sir,&mdash;may
  vacation continue as happy as it is this bright morning on undescribably
  lovely beach. I am so pleased that our paths met here at famous
  crossroads."</p>

  <p>"We share that pleasure, sir," MacMaster replied. His wife nodded and
  smiled. "We'll be thinking of ye as we travel on to Aberdeen. Our very best
  wishes for success."</p>

  <p>Charlie and the fortune-teller went inside, and sat down on a sofa. "You
  are favorite of the gods," Chan remarked. "If I needed alibi I would ask
  nothing better than word from honest people such as those."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro smiled. "Yes&mdash;they're a grand pair. Simple and wholesome
  and addicted to all the old virtues." He paused. "Well, Inspector, you know
  where I was during those vital eighteen minutes. How about the others?"</p>

  <p>"I know also where Robert Fyfe was," Charlie replied, "though much about
  his actions puzzles me. Speaking of the rest, they have no such luck. Not one
  has offered alibi."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro nodded. "Yes&mdash;and one among them may need an alibi badly
  before this affair is ended. You had, I take it, no flash of inspiration in
  the night?"</p>

  <p>Chan sadly shook his head. "I had nothing but plenty good sleep. And
  you?"</p>

  <p>The other smiled. "I'm afraid I weakly fell into a dreamless slumber too.
  No&mdash;I have thought hard, but I'm afraid I can't help you much. There are
  so many possibilities. Shall we go over them? Rita and Wilkie Ballou. Both in
  Hollywood at the time of Denny Mayo's death. Mayo was said to be a bit
  careless with the ladies&mdash;and it is clear that Ballou is a notably
  jealous man."</p>

  <p>"I think about Ballou," remarked Chan slowly.</p>

  <p>"It might pay," Tarneverro agreed. "He was wandering about&mdash;came into
  the living-room to get a cigarette&mdash;claims he stayed there. Turning from
  him for the time being, there's Alan Jaynes. His state of mind was rather
  emotional last night. Who knows anything about him? Suppose that like that of
  Ballou, his is a wildly jealous nature. He saw those flowers&mdash;not
  his&mdash;on the shoulder of the woman he loved. We found them trampled under
  foot, as though in rage. The Mayo affair, as I believe you pointed out, may
  have had nothing to do with Miss Fane's murder, after all. Perhaps it was
  just a case of mad unreasoning jealousy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," answered Chan calmly. "There is also Martino."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Martino," repeated the fortune-teller. A black look swept
  across his handsome face. "It would give me great pleasure to help you pin
  this thing on him. He has made some very rude remarks about me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What sort of man you call him?" Charlie asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he seems to have brains," Tarneverro admitted "And a kind of rude
  strength&mdash;a queer combination, the esthete and the brute in one package.
  He wasn't in Hollywood when Mayo was killed, but once again&mdash;perhaps we
  are on the wrong trail there. Martino's been a bit of a ladies'
  man&mdash;there may have been some unsuspected relationship between him and
  Shelah Fane. Certainly that handkerchief in his pocket had a fishy look to
  me. Of course he denied he owned it&mdash;who wouldn't? But if any one placed
  it on Martino's person, he was taking a tremendous and unnecessary risk. Why
  not throw it into the bushes&mdash;drop it on the lawn? Why attempt the
  difficult, the dangerous? The handkerchief, Inspector, may have been
  Martino's own property! He may have gone on carrying it after the murder,
  quite innocent of the fact that it contained those splinters of glass.
  Unless"&mdash;the fortune-teller paused&mdash;"unless you have evidence that
  it belonged to some one else?"</p>

  <p>Chan regarded him with sleepy eyes. "I have so little evidence," he
  sighed. "Languishing in such a state, how gladly I hear you talk. Continue,
  please, to dispense logic and eloquence, those twin blossoms of speech. I now
  bring up the name of Huntley Van Horn."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro regarded him keenly. "Have you anything on Van Horn?"</p>

  <p>"I regret to note that he has no alibi. Also, he was at proper place at
  proper time to do the deed." Chan paused, and decided he would keep some
  matters to himself. "Aside from that, I have nothing of importance. Deign to
  state your opinion of the man."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Tarneverro, "I haven't thought much about Van Horn. He's an
  odd, rather bitter sort of chap&mdash;a notorious bachelor&mdash;the despair
  of all the women. No breath of scandal has ever touched him. I have always
  admired the fellow, though heaven knows he has never been any too friendly to
  me. He's an intelligent chap, with excellent taste&mdash;a bit conceited,
  perhaps, but no man could receive the adulation he does, and escape that." He
  considered a moment. "No, Inspector," he added with sudden decision, "in
  spite of the fact that his opportunities were excellent, as you point out, I
  can not see Huntley Van Horn as our quarry in this affair."</p>

  <p>Charlie rose. "Thank you for this little conversation." He glanced at his
  watch. "Now I must haste to home of Shelah Fane. You will accompany me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," Tarneverro replied, "but I am not at liberty to do so just at
  present. You'll let me know of any new developments, won't you? It isn't mere
  curiosity on my part. If we are to work together I must, of course, know what
  you are doing."</p>

  <p>"We will encounter from time to time," Chan assured him. They walked to
  the hotel door.</p>

  <p>The head bell-man said something to Tarneverro in Cantonese, and the
  fortune-teller regarded him with a blank uncomprehending look. "What does he
  say?" he inquired of Charlie.</p>

  <p>"He makes most respectful inquiry after your health this splendid
  morning," Chan translated.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm fine, Sam," Tarneverro smiled. There was a puzzled expression on
  Sam's broad face. "So long, Inspector," the fortune-teller continued. "Ring
  me up if you strike anything new. I'll be hunting about myself&mdash;anything
  I can do&mdash;well, I'm with you to the finish, as I told you."</p>

  <p>"You are so extremely kind," bowed Chan, and returned to his car.</p>

  <p>The front lawn of Shelah Fane's house, when Charlie arrived there, lay
  peaceful and serene in the shade of its ancient banyan tree. Jessop answered
  the door, perfect in manner and attire, as always.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Constable?" he said. "The morning is rather on the gorgeous
  side, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"Presume so," agreed Chan. "It is matter we do not notice here. All
  mornings much the same."</p>

  <p>"Which must, if I may say so, sir, grow a trifle monotonous in time." The
  butler followed Chan into the living-room. "Now in England, Constable,
  drawing back the curtains of a morning is something of a sporting
  proposition."</p>

  <p>Charlie stood looking about the great room, where so much had happened the
  night before. It was calm, quiet and sunny now.</p>

  <p>"Miss Julie and Mr. Bradshaw are in the neighborhood of the beach, sir,"
  Jessop remarked. "One of your officers&mdash;a Mr. Hettick, I
  believe&mdash;is busily engaged in the pavilion."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;Hettick is our finger-print expert," Charlie explained. "I
  will go outside at once." On the lawn he encountered the two young people,
  who greeted him warmly. "So sorry to develop into pest," he said to Julie.
  "But path of duty is often rocky one."</p>

  <p>"Why, you could never be that," she smiled. "We've been expecting
  you."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her, so fresh and lovely, her blue eyes wide and innocent.
  He thought of the emerald ring.</p>

  <p>"Well, how did you like my story in the paper this morning?" Bradshaw
  wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"My perusal was of a necessity hurried," Chan replied. "Imagine it covered
  the ground."</p>

  <p>"Is that the best you can say for it?" the boy complained.</p>

  <p>Charlie shrugged. "Always think twice before you scatter tributes," he
  answered. "If no one had praised the donkey's song, he would not still be
  singing." He grinned. "The comparison is, of course, unhappy one. I take it
  you enjoy a pleasant morning?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I just ran out to help Julie," the boy told him. "I've been acting as
  a shock-absorber between her and the reporters. The fellows on the evening
  paper weren't very polite. They seem a bit miffed the story didn't break
  right for them."</p>

  <p>"A natural feeling," Chan replied.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do now?" asked Bradshaw.</p>

  <p>"Propose to look about in bright light of day," Charlie answered.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you," Bradshaw said. "Julie you just sit down and relax. Close
  your eyes and try not to think. Nobody ever has at Waikiki and you can't
  tell&mdash;it might be dangerous."</p>

  <p>The girl smiled at him and dropped on to a beach chair.</p>

  <p>"Want to keep the poor kid cheered up," Bradshaw explained, as he and Chan
  walked toward the pavilion. "This has been a pretty tough shock for her. But
  in time I think I can convince her that all her troubles are over. That
  is&mdash;if she'll marry me."</p>

  <p>"You possess excellent opinion of yourself," Charlie smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I? I know myself so well."</p>

  <p>As they reached the pavilion, Hettick came out. He had been brought over
  from the mainland at the time of the reorganization to strengthen the force,
  and he had never been very cordial to Charlie, whom he had replaced in the
  role of finger-print expert.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Hettick," Chan said politely. "Have you had successful
  time of it?"</p>

  <p>"Not very," the man replied. "Plenty of prints, but mostly those of the
  murdered woman. All the others can be accounted for, I guess. Come inside,
  and I'll show you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One little moment," interrupted Charlie. "First I take careless stroll
  about outside of place."</p>

  <p>Followed by Bradshaw, he made his way through some bushes at the side of
  the cottage, and came out on the public beach that bounded the grounds on the
  west. Beneath the single pavilion window which opened on that beach&mdash;the
  one under which Smith had stood the previous night&mdash;he paused.</p>

  <p>A great many footprints were there now, and those of the beach-comber
  barely distinguishable. Charlie stooped down and carefully sifted the sand.
  With a little cry of satisfaction, he stood erect again.</p>

  <p>"Important discovery," he announced.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw came nearer. He saw in Charlie's palm the remains of a small
  cigar, the size of a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Trampled into the sand," Charlie added. "I would never have expected to
  find this here."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;I know only one man who smokes these," the boy cried. "I saw
  him&mdash;last night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are quite correct," Chan beamed. "One man, and who would believe he
  could act so careless? I am consumed with wonder. When did Mr. Alan Jaynes
  stand outside this window&mdash;and why?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">XV. &mdash; "TWO JUICES OF THE ORANGE"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Charlie took an empty envelope from his pocket and carefully
  placed his latest discovery inside it. He and the boy again penetrated the
  bushes and entered the pavilion. Hettick was sitting idly by the
  dressing-table, with the paraphernalia of his calling spread out before
  him.</p>

  <p>Dropping down on a wicker chair, Chan glanced around the room where, only
  the night before, he had encountered tragedy. The detective's face was placid
  and serene; he might have been awaiting the luncheon bell untroubled by any
  problem. Through an enormous plate-glass window he watched a liner from the
  coast move slowly into port.</p>

  <p>"You have enjoyed no luck here, Mr. Hettick?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not much," replied Hettick. "The things on the table are covered with
  prints&mdash;all those of the murdered woman herself. I got her record at the
  mortuary this morning. By the way, the coroner asked me to tell you he has
  postponed the inquest until to-morrow. He expects you to have something by
  then."</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "Thank him for the compliment. Also inform him I will
  exchange places with him at any moment." His gaze returned to the room; the
  woodwork, he noted, had recently been painted white. Suddenly he rose and
  stepped to the small window opening on the beach. "You have not tested this
  sill, I believe," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;as a matter of fact, I haven't," Hettick answered. "I meant to,
  but it slipped my mind."</p>

  <p>Chan grinned. "Mind gets so slippery in warm climate. May I humbly suggest
  you do so now?"</p>

  <p>Hettick came over and covered the sill with his lamp black. With practiced
  hand he applied the camel's-hair brush.</p>

  <p>Charlie and the boy crowded close. "Ah!" cried Chan. On the smooth white
  surface of the sill were the marks of some one's fingers and thumb.</p>

  <p>"These were not made by Shelah Fane?" Charlie inquired.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Hettick. "Those were left by a man's hand."</p>

  <p>Chan stood, deep in thought. "Recent, too. We achieve some progress now. A
  man's hand. A man opened that screen, climbed up on sill. Why? To enter room,
  of course. When? Last night, when murder was in atmosphere. Yes, we move, we
  advance." He paused. "What man?" In his coat pocket, his fingers touched the
  envelope containing the cigar stub. He turned with sudden decision. "One
  thing is certain. I must without delay obtain thumb prints of Alan Jaynes."
  Smiling at Jimmy Bradshaw he added: "Police have fine clue and promise early
  arrest. But if you publish one word of this, I recall matter of your laundry
  and put you in jail at once."</p>

  <p>"I won't use it, Charlie," promised the boy. "What are you going to do
  now?"</p>

  <p>"I propose to leave you with nobody for company&mdash;except Miss Julie.
  And who is she?"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, and I'll tell you. She's the most&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Later," cut in Chan. "Much later. Mr. Hettick, I request that you remain
  here until my return. Your keen eye will be required. I am off for session at
  Grand Hotel."</p>

  <p>He left the pavilion, and the boy followed. As Charlie passed out of sight
  around the corner of the house, Bradshaw went over to where Julie sat. He
  dropped down beside her.</p>

  <p>"Has that funny policeman gone?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"For a few minutes. He'll be back before he's missed." Looking up at her,
  the boy thought he saw an expression of fear cross her delicate face. He
  wondered. "Charlie has just made an important discovery outside the pavilion
  window," he added.</p>

  <p>"W-what?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he'd like to have me tell you," Bradshaw answered. "Not
  just yet, at any rate. But&mdash;what about this Alan Jaynes? You don't know
  him very well, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely at all," the girl replied. "I never saw him until yesterday
  morning. Shelah met him in Tahiti&mdash;I believe she was very fond of him.
  But Shelah was fond of&mdash;so many people. She was even&mdash;fond of me."
  Without warning Julie turned away her head and burst into tears.</p>

  <p>Bradshaw got up and laid a hand on her heaving shoulder. "Now&mdash;now,"
  he said uncomfortably. "You mustn't do that. You're ruining all my press
  stuff. Waikiki, the abode of peace, the crescent beach where happiness rules
  supreme. Suppose one of these tourists who took me at my word should see
  you."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'm sorry," she sobbed. "I'm not happy; I can't be."</p>

  <p>"No, of course you can't&mdash;not at this moment, I mean. But why not
  look ahead to all the happiness that's coming, and draw a little advance on
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I'll&mdash;I'll never be happy again," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. I'm going to make the world as glamorous for you as I've made
  this town in the Tourist Bureau ads. When we're married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She pushed him away. "We'll never be married. Oh, it's terrible. I'm
  horrid, really&mdash;and you don't suspect. You'll hate me&mdash;when you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Do tell! Look at me." He leaned over and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't," she cried.</p>

  <p>"I've got to," he smiled. "It's my duty. I've advertised this place for
  its romance, and romance there must be if I have to attend to it myself. Now
  listen to me&mdash;inside a week or less all this will be over, and you can
  begin to forget. Charlie Chan is going to solve the puzzle at any
  minute&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;do you think so?"</p>

  <p>"He's sure to. You can't keep anything from Charlie."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"I know," Bradshaw replied firmly.</p>

  <p>Scarcely sharing Bradshaw's confidence, Chan was at that moment entering
  the lobby of the Grand Hotel. He waved a hand toward the bell-man, and went
  at once to the desk.</p>

  <p>"I arrive again," he remarked to the clerk. "For a nonpaying guest, I am
  plenty much in evidence around this place. Will you give me number of room
  occupied by Mr. Alan Jaynes, if you will be so good?"</p>

  <p>The clerk smilingly gave it to him, and pointed out the house telephones
  at the right of the desk. Charlie was relieved to hear the Britisher's
  answering voice. He politely requested a moment's conversation, and Jaynes
  replied that he would come down immediately.</p>

  <p>Charlie walked with unaccustomed speed to the lounge. A small Filipino
  bell-boy was there alone, and the detective summoned him.</p>

  <p>"I wish to be served with two of your delicious orange-juice drinks," he
  announced.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied the boy.</p>

  <p>"I will also accompany you while you secure same." The boy appeared taken
  aback, but it was not his role to argue. From out of the jungle he had come to
  learn that the guest is always right.</p>

  <p>Charlie followed his small guide to the serving pantry, where they
  encountered a man in a white apron.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Chan, of the Honolulu police," Charlie explained briefly. "I
  have just engaged to purchase two juices of the orange. Will you hand me the
  glasses in which you propose to place same, please?"</p>

  <p>The servant was too weary to be surprised. The climate, as he often
  explained to his wife, had got him. He produced the glasses and Charlie,
  removing an immaculate handkerchief from his pocket, began to polish them
  briskly.</p>

  <p>"This action, I hasten to say, involves no criticism of you," he remarked.
  "But I am reading lately about germs." He grinned. "A very dangerous form of
  animal life." It could be noted, however, that it was only the outside of the
  tumblers that concerned him. He completed the task, set the objects of his
  attention carefully down on the tray the boy had brought, and reaching into
  his pocket, handed a quarter to the serving man. "You will do me great favor
  if you will fill these receptacles without placing fingers on same." He
  turned to the boy. "That also applies to you. Do you understand? You are not
  to touch those glasses. Set tray on table as it is. Otherwise, when moment
  arrives for your tip, I develop far-away look in eye and can not see
  you."</p>

  <p>Returning to the lounge, Charlie found the Britisher already there.
  "Ah&mdash;Mr. Jaynes," he said. "I am happy to see you again. You had good
  night's rest, I hope?"</p>

  <p>Jaynes stared at him. "No," he replied, "I didn't; but what of it?"</p>

  <p>"So sorry," Chan cried. "Waikiki is famous sleeping place, and being old
  resident of Honolulu, I experience deep pain when it fails to live up to
  reputation. Will you do me the honor to join me on this sofa?"</p>

  <p>He dropped down on the seat, which creaked protestingly beneath him.</p>

  <p>"Harsh voice of furniture proclaims to world my excessive avoirdupois," he
  continued affably. "I diet and I fast, but to no avail. What is to be, will
  be. Man&mdash;who is he to fix own weight upon the scales? All that is
  determined elsewhere."</p>

  <p>Jaynes sat down beside him. "What can I do for you this morning,
  Inspector?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"You can accept, if you will be so kind, renewed apologies for detaining
  you on this island. Some people pronounce it Paradise, but even Paradise, I
  can appreciate, looks not so good when one is panting to travel elsewhere.
  Again my warm regrets. I assure you I apply myself with all possible speed to
  task of clearing up mystery, so that you may make quick exit."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to hear that," nodded Jaynes. He took out a case and offered
  Charlie one of his little black cigars. "No?" He lighted one himself. "You
  are making progress, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"I encounter difficulties," Charlie admitted. "Those who know, don't talk;
  those who talk, don't know. But that is always to be expected in my work.
  Within last hour I think I see faint glimmer of light ahead. Ah&mdash;" The
  Filipino boy had arrived with the tray. he set it down on a small table
  before them. "I should have said, Mr. Jaynes, that I am on orange-juice diet
  and, since the hour of the drink is here, I have ventured to order same for you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, thanks," replied the Britisher. "I don't believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Same is all prepared," Charlie protested, and a note of imminent offense
  crept into his voice. "The beverage is harmless. You are not going to
  refuse?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;thank you," said Jaynes. At the moment he wanted nothing less,
  but he knew how easily the feelings of a Chinese may be hurt, and he could
  not risk any further offense to this particular representative of the race.
  "You are very good." He reached for a glass.</p>

  <p>Beaming, Charlie lifted his own. "We will drink to my quick success, since
  you desire it equally with me." He imbibed heartily, and set the glass down.
  "Presume mild nature of the liquid gives you hearty pain. I have noted how
  bitterly men from your country resent this prohibition."</p>

  <p>"What prohibition?" Jaynes inquired.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you mock and jeer. Well, it is noble experiment, but it is not new,
  as many think. The Emperor Yu, who came to the throne of China in year 2205
  B. C., said when he tasted liquor for the first time, this will do my people
  much harm, and forbade its use. His edict had good effect for a while, but
  later got lost in dim pages of history. China," added Chan, drinking again,
  "like the purse of a generous man, has endured much. But it still
  survives."</p>

  <p>Jaynes was looking at him with a deep curiosity. Had this odd policeman
  dropped in merely to discuss prohibition? Charlie noted the look.</p>

  <p>"But to return to our mutton broth," he said. "I desire to make inquiries
  of you regarding last night. You are most unfortunate man not to possess nice
  alibi for motions during time of homicide. You were, as I understand things,
  wandering about plenty mad at fatal hour?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I was," Jaynes admitted.</p>

  <p>"From the moment when you left Martino on beach until he went out and
  found you with announcement of murder, you exist quite alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Making your walk, how far down beach did you penetrate?"</p>

  <p>"Only as far as the Moana Hotel. I sat there under the banyan tree and
  tried to think what I had better do."</p>

  <p>"You did not&mdash;will you join me in another quaffing&mdash;ah,
  yes&mdash;you did not travel on to property of Shelah Fane?"</p>

  <p>"I've just told you," replied Jaynes, "that I went only as far as the
  Moana. As I say, I sat down there to try to figure things out. When I had
  grown a bit calmer, it occurred to me that perhaps I was making a big row
  about nothing. A woman who could be so easily influenced by a silly
  fortune-teller&mdash;I asked myself whether she would, after all, make a
  satisfactory wife. Her life was far removed from mine&mdash;I began to feel
  that the whole affair might turn out to have been a mere passing infatuation
  with both of us. I resolved to take the boat at midnight and, if possible,
  forget the entire business. After that was decided, I felt better. I came
  back here, past the Outrigger Club, and just outside the hotel Martino met me
  with the appalling news of the poor girl's murder."</p>

  <p>"No one noted you at Moana under banyan tree?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy not. I sat in a dark corner."</p>

  <p>"Were you ever in pavilion where Shelah Fane encountered finish?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I never saw the place."</p>

  <p>"Then you could not have been in the neighborhood at any time? Hovering
  about window, for example?"</p>

  <p>"Well, hardly." Without prompting, Jaynes took up his glass and drained
  it. Suddenly he stared at Charlie. "I say&mdash;why do you ask me that?"</p>

  <p>"I seek only to narrow search," Chan explained. "That will be all, thank
  you. Can you name hour of next boat to mainland?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly can," answered the Britisher. "There's one to-morrow at noon.
  I hope to heaven&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will extend myself to the utmost," smiled Chan. "Though, to look at me,
  many might remark that I had already done so."</p>

  <p>Jaynes laughed. "Don't let that thought deter you," he said. "You'll do
  your best, I know. By the way, I'm afraid I was a bit rude to you last
  night&mdash;but I was very anxious to get away. For many reasons&mdash;not
  only my business in the States&mdash;but this whole terrible affair&mdash;I
  wanted to be out of it. I still do. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," nodded Chan gravely. His left hand, in the side pocket of
  his coat, touched a certain envelope. "I will say good morning," he
  added.</p>

  <p>He stood watching the Britisher cross the terrace and stroll toward the
  sea. Sensing some one at his back, he turned just in time. An old bent
  Chinese who continually paraded the lounge in his native costume, armed with
  a brush and dust-pan, was reaching out for the glasses.</p>

  <p>"Haie!" Chan seized the withered hand. "Do not touch, or the wrath of the
  seven watchful gods descends upon you." He took out his handkerchief and
  tenderly wrapped it round the glass from which Jaynes had drunk. "I am
  removing this, and the affair does not concern you."</p>

  <p>But evidently the old man thought it did concern him, for he followed
  Charlie to the desk. There Chan encountered one of the managers. "I should
  like to purchase this object," he said, revealing what the handkerchief held.
  "Kindly name price."</p>

  <p>The manager laughed. "Oh, that's all right. Take it along. What are you
  doing, Charlie? Collecting finger-prints from our harmless guests?"</p>

  <p>"You are close to truth," nodded Chan. "Save perhaps with that word
  harmless. Thank you so much. And now will you kindly call off this aged
  gentleman who thinks he has captured one of the forty thieves?"</p>

  <p>The manager said something to the servant, who moved away, muttering to
  himself. His comments, Chan knew, were not complimentary, but he gave no
  heed. He hurried through the door to his car.</p>

  <p>Deep in thought, he drove back to Shelah Fane's house. Were the
  finger-prints on this glass identical with those on the window-sill in the
  pavilion? If they were, then he was approaching journey's end.</p>

  <p>Hettick was waiting, and to him Charlie entrusted his precious cargo,
  still redolent of orange juice. The expert set quickly to work. Presently he
  stood by the window, the tumbler in one hand, a magnifying-glass in the
  other. Chan came close, awaiting the verdict.</p>

  <p>Hettick shook his head. "Nothing like it," he announced. "You've been on
  the wrong trail this time, Inspector."</p>

  <p>Keenly disappointed, Chan sat down in a chair. So it had not been Alan
  Jaynes who entered this room last night? It had all seemed to fit in so
  neatly that up to this minute he had not had a doubt of it. On the wrong
  trail, eh? He hadn't cared for the way in which Hettick had said that. The
  men at the station had been in a rather unfriendly mood since Charlie's
  return from the mainland. They had expected to find him in a haughty and
  triumphant state of mind since his exploits there, and the fact that he had
  shown no trace whatever of such an attitude, had done nothing to lessen their
  envy. He had been forced to endure many joking remarks that held an
  undercurrent of hostility.</p>

  <p>On the wrong trail, eh? Well, who didn't take the wrong path occasionally
  in this business? Where was the superman so good that he never erred?</p>

  <p>On the wrong trail. Chan sat deep in thought. Jaynes had been outside that
  window&mdash;the stub of the small cigar, which he had evidently forgotten,
  was proof enough. But it was not he who had pushed up the screen and entered,
  leaving the imprint of fingers on the white sill. Some one else had done
  that. Who? Who else had been&mdash;</p>

  <p>Suddenly Charlie smote his forehead a resounding blow. "Haie&mdash;I have
  been complete and utter idiot. I move too fast, without proper thought.
  Everybody seeks to hurry me&mdash;even my own family. And I was not built for
  hurry. Hurry is the wind that destroys the scaffolding." He turned to
  Hettick. "What has become of finger-print record of beachcomber, taken at
  station last night?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," replied Hettick. "I've got that here." He produced a manila envelope
  from his pocket and removed a glass plate. "Do you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think, yes&mdash;a little late, but still I think," said Charlie. He
  took the plate from the unresisting hand of his brother officer and hurried
  to the window. "Come quickly," he called. "Your glass&mdash;look! What is
  your decision?"</p>

  <p>"They are the same," Hettick announced.</p>

  <p>Triumph shone brightly in Charlie's little eyes. "At last I arrive
  somewhere," he cried. "Smith, the beachcomber, was in this room last night! Am
  I forever on wrong trail or do I have my lucific moments?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">XVI. &mdash; A WORD OF WARNING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Chan's air of calm detachment had vanished for the moment,
  and he walked the floor as though inspired by his latest discovery.</p>

  <p>"Smith, the beachcomber," he said once more. "Dreary bit of human wreckage
  cast up on shore of splendid island. Ragged remnant of a man&mdash;how busy
  he was around this building last night. A big evening, I think, in the life
  of Smith."</p>

  <p>Hettick was gathering up the tools of his trade. "Well, I believe I'll go
  back to the station now," he remarked. "I've given you boys something to work
  on. Go out and make the most of it."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are clever detective," Chan grinned. "Things slip from mind
  sometimes, but when humble fellow worker recalls them, then you move on like
  avenging demon. You have given us material indeed. Yes, please return to
  station at once. I will arrive later, and in meantime I respectfully suggest
  that you send out alarm call for Smith. Tell Chief beach-comber must be
  pulled into station with no delay. Let all low dives be explored. Put Kashimo
  on it. He is our most passioned searcher, and what is better, he knows all
  cracks and crannies of modest little underworld."</p>

  <p>Hettick promised he would deliver the message, and departed. Charlie
  followed at his heels. He saw Julie and Bradshaw on the lawn, and paused
  beside them. "You wish ride to town?" he inquired of the latter.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," Bradshaw replied. "I've got my car today. Besides, Julie has
  just persuaded me to stay for lunch."</p>

  <p>"May life hold for her no sterner task than such persuasion," smiled Chan.
  "I do not wish to cloud your future, Miss Julie, but must warn you that I
  return here soon."</p>

  <p>He was skirting the house when Jessop appeared at the lanai door.
  "Ah&mdash;er&mdash;Constable," he said. "May I ask you to step inside just a
  moment?"</p>

  <p>Struck by the seriousness of the butler's manner, Charlie passed through
  the door which the servant held open. "You have something to say to me?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I have, sir. Kindly come with me." Jessop led the way into a small
  reception-room near the front of the house. He entered it
  first&mdash;evidence of unusual abstraction on his part. "Oh&mdash;I beg your
  pardon, sir. I'll just close this door, so we may have an undisturbed
  tete-a-tete."</p>

  <p>"Time is none too plentiful with me&mdash;" Chan began, somewhat surprised
  by these elaborate preparations.</p>

  <p>"I know that, Constable. I will&mdash;er&mdash;plunge in at once&mdash;"
  In spite of this promise, he hesitated. "My old father, who was for more than
  forty years the trusted employee of a rather exacting duke, remarked to me in
  my youth: 'A good servant, Cedric, sees all, knows all, but tells nothing.'
  It is only after prolonged and mature consideration, Constable, that I have
  determined to ignore that excellent counsel."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "Circumstances," he remarked, "upset cases."</p>

  <p>"Precisely, sir. I have always been a law-abiding man, and what is more, I
  am eager to see you get to the bottom of this matter without&mdash;if I may
  say so&mdash;further delay. Last evening I chanced to be busy in the hall at
  the moment when you were engaged in interviewing Miss Julie regarding the
  emerald ring. This may suggest to you that I was eavesdropping, but I can
  assure you that such duplicity was farthest from my thoughts. I heard the
  young lady tell you that Miss Fane had given her that ring early in the
  morning, and that she&mdash;Miss Julie, I mean&mdash;had held it in her
  possession from that moment on, until you discovered it in her room."</p>

  <p>"Such was Miss Julie's story," Charlie agreed.</p>

  <p>"I am at a complete loss to understand it, sir. I don't know what she
  meant by her testimony&mdash;but I do know this. At about seven last night,
  Miss Fane called me to her room and gave me the letter which I was to deliver
  to Mr. Tarneverro immediately on his arrival at the house. As she passed over
  the missive, I distinctly saw, gleaming on her right hand, the ring in
  question. I am positive on that point, Constable, and prepared to offer a
  sworn statement along those lines."</p>

  <p>Chan was silent for a moment. He thought of Julie O'Neill, so young, so
  innocent-looking. "Thank you very much," he said at last. "What you say seems
  of vast importance."</p>

  <p>"I only hope it may not be so important as it appears," Jessop replied. "I
  tell you this, Constable, with considerable reluctance. I have nothing
  against Miss Julie&mdash;a charming young woman&mdash;indeed she is, sir. I
  was tempted for a long time to remain silent, but it struck me that my duty
  lay, most decidedly, in the opposite direction. Like yourself, I desire to
  see the miscreant in this affair adequately punished. Miss Fane was always
  extremely kind to me."</p>

  <p>Chan moved toward the door. "I shall act upon your information at once,"
  he announced.</p>

  <p>Jessop looked uncomfortable. "If my name could only be kept out of it,
  sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Same may not be possible," Charlie told him.</p>

  <p>Jessop sighed. "I recognize that, Constable. I can only say again that I
  am quite positive I saw the ring. My eyesight is excellent, which, to a man
  of my age, is a matter of deep satisfaction."</p>

  <p>They went out into the hall. Anna, the maid, was slowly coming down the
  stairs. Chan turned to Jessop.</p>

  <p>"Thank you again," he said. "You may go now."</p>

  <p>The butler disappeared toward the kitchen, and Charlie waited for Anna at
  the foot of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," he remarked pleasantly. "I desire one word with you,
  please."</p>

  <p>"Of course," replied Anna, and followed him into the living-room.</p>

  <p>"You recall story of Miss Julie regarding the ring?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, sir."</p>

  <p>"Same was given her by Miss Fane in early morning and remained in her
  possession. Have you anything to say regarding that?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why, what do you mean, sir?" the maid returned.</p>

  <p>"You did not yourself see the ring on Miss Fane's finger during the day?
  Or when she came to you to procure pin for orchids?"</p>

  <p>"If I did, it made no impression on me, sir."</p>

  <p>"You see things, yet they make no impression?"</p>

  <p>"You know how it is, sir. Things become familiar and you don't really
  notice. What I mean is&mdash;the ring may or may not have been there. I'm
  afraid I can't say, sir."</p>

  <p>"You wish the matter to stand at that?"</p>

  <p>"I fear it must, as far as I am concerned."</p>

  <p>Chan bowed. "Thank you&mdash;that is all."</p>

  <p>He stepped through a French window, and walked slowly across the lanai. He
  had no heart for the task that faced him now, but many such tasks had
  confronted him in the past, and he had never faltered. Stepping out on the
  lawn, he went over to a beach swing where Bradshaw and the girl were
  sitting.</p>

  <p>"Miss Julie," he began. The girl looked up at him, and at sight of his
  grave face, her own paled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Chan," she said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Miss Julie, you have told me Miss Fane gave you that emerald ring soon
  after her arrival yesterday morning. Why did you tell me that?"</p>

  <p>"Because it's the truth," Julie answered bravely.</p>

  <p>"Then how do you account for fact that ring was seen on her finger last
  evening at seven?"</p>

  <p>"Who says it was?" the girl cried.</p>

  <p>"Is that important?"</p>

  <p>"It is very important. Who says it was?"</p>

  <p>"I learn it from what I think reliable source."</p>

  <p>"You have no means of knowing how reliable, Mr. Chan. Who made that
  statement? Not Miss Dixon&mdash;she isn't up yet. It must have been one of
  the servants. Jessop, perhaps. Was it Jessop, Mr. Chan?"</p>

  <p>"What does it matter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I assure you it matters very much. Because, you see, I don't stand
  very well with Jessop. There's an old grudge between us&mdash;on his part, at
  least."</p>

  <p>"You will, please, explain what you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. As I told you last night, Miss Fane's servants were always
  cheating her. When I first became her secretary I shut my eyes to it, because
  I'm no tale-bearer. But about a year ago, her finances became terribly
  involved, and I began an investigation. I discovered that Jessop had a most
  shameless arrangement with the tradespeople&mdash;all the bills were padded
  outrageously and Jessop was getting a share of the profits.</p>

  <p>"I said nothing to Miss Fane&mdash;I knew what that would mean&mdash;a
  temperamental outburst, tears and recriminations, and probably a grand scene
  of forgiveness in the end. She was always so kind-hearted. Instead I went to
  Jessop, told him I knew what he was doing and that the thing must stop. He
  was most indignant. All the other servants in Hollywood, he told me, were
  doing the same, and he seemed to consider it a sort of royal prerogative. But
  when I threatened to tell Miss Fane, he backed down and agreed to put an end
  to the practice. I fancy he did, too, but since that time he has always been
  very cool to me, and I know that I have never been forgiven. So you see why I
  asked you if it was Jessop who told that&mdash;falsehood about the ring."</p>

  <p>"Just where do you stand&mdash;as you say it&mdash;with Anna?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Anna and I have always been on the most friendly terms," Julie
  answered. "A good steady girl who saves her money and buys bonds with it.
  It's money honestly come by&mdash;I'm sure of that because"&mdash;Julie
  smiled faintly&mdash;"the poor thing has never had a chance to pad bills.
  None of them passes through her hands."</p>

  <p>Chan looked at Julie's flushed face for a long moment "Then you desire to
  repeat that Miss Fane herself gave you the ring yesterday morning?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly do. It's the truth, Mr. Chan."</p>

  <p>Charlie bowed. "I can only accept your word, Miss Julie. It is quite
  possible&mdash;the person who told me of seeing the ring last night may have
  been moved by ancient grudge&mdash;I thought of it at the time. Miss Julie, I
  say to myself, too fine and sweet for underhand work. You will note, Jimmy,
  that you and I have tastes in common."</p>

  <p>"Which does you credit," smiled Bradshaw.</p>

  <p>"Which credits us both," amended Chan. "I will no longer hang about, a
  blot on this lovely scene. My kindest good-by&mdash;until we meet again."</p>

  <p>He walked thoughtfully to his car, and drove away through the hot noon
  sunshine. "So many roads that wind and wind&mdash;" He had read that
  somewhere. He sighed. So many roads&mdash;would the little car finally leap
  down the right one?</p>

  <p>As he approached the Grand Hotel, Huntley Van Horn was again in his
  thoughts. He was reluctant to reappear so soon at the hotel's main entrance
  so, parking his car in the street, he entered the grounds and walked toward
  the palm court. A group of excited tourists was gathered beneath the tallest
  of the coco-palms, and looking aloft, Charlie saw one of the beach-boys, in a
  red bathing-suit, climbing the tree with the agility of a monkey. He stood
  for a moment, admiring the boy's skill.</p>

  <p>"The kid's clever, eh, Inspector?" remarked a voice at his elbow.</p>

  <p>He turned and looked into the smiling gray eyes of Van Horn. They were
  standing a little apart from the others, and the picture actor was the
  recipient of many awed, adoring glances from young women who were ostensibly
  there to watch the beach-boy.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Van Horn," Chan said. "This meeting is indeed most fortunate. I
  am calling here for the sole purpose of seeing you."</p>

  <p>"Really?" The actor looked up at the tree. "Well, he seems to have
  traveled as far as he can on that one. Shall we go on the
  veranda&mdash;pardon me, the lanai&mdash;and have a chat?"</p>

  <p>"The idea is most suitable," Charlie agreed. He followed Van Horn and they
  sat down in a secluded corner. The boy had descended the coco-palm and stood
  now the center of an admiring group, hugely enjoying the limelight. Chan
  watched him.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes in my heart," he remarked, "arouses hot envy of the beach-boys.
  To exist so happily&mdash;to have no cares and troubles, no worries&mdash;ah,
  that must be what men mean by Paradise. All they ask of life is one
  bathing-suit, slightly worn."</p>

  <p>Van Horn laughed. "You have worries, I take it, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>Charlie turned to him. He had decided to be frank. "I have." He paused.
  "You are one of them," he added suddenly.</p>

  <p>The picture actor was unperturbed. "You flatter me," he answered. "Just
  how am I worrying you, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>"You worry me because in this matter of Miss Shelah Fane's murder you are
  quite defenseless. Not only do you possess no alibi, but of all those
  concerned, you were nearest to the scene of her death. You walked across lawn
  at very important moment, Mr. Van Horn. I could not worry about you more if
  you were own son."</p>

  <p>Van Horn grinned. "That's kind of you, Inspector. I appreciate it.
  Yes&mdash;I am rather badly cast in the story of the crime. But I rely on
  you. As an intelligent man, you must realize that I could have had absolutely
  no motive for killing the poor girl. Until I joined her company to make this
  picture, I scarcely knew her, and all through our journey and the work
  together, we were on the friendliest terms."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," Chan watched the actor's face eagerly. "Were you likewise on
  friendly terms with Denny Mayo?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Just what has Denny Mayo to do with all this?" Van Horn asked. Despite
  his best efforts, his expression was not quite so casual as he wanted it to
  be.</p>

  <p>"May have much to do with it," Charlie told him. "I seek to upearth facts.
  Maybe you assist me. I repeat&mdash;were you on friendly terms with Denny
  Mayo?"</p>

  <p>"I knew him fairly well," Van Horn admitted. "A most attractive
  chap&mdash;a wild Irishman&mdash;you never could tell what he was going to do
  next. Every one was very fond of him. His death was a great shock."</p>

  <p>"Who killed him?" Charlie asked blandly.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew," Van Horn replied. "Last night, when I heard you asking
  everybody about three years ago last June, in Hollywood, I sensed that you
  thought his death involved in this somehow. I'm curious to know the
  connection."</p>

  <p>"That, no doubt," said Charlie, "is why you haste to library early this
  morning to do hot reading about Mayo case?"</p>

  <p>Van Horn smiled. "Oh&mdash;so you found me among my books, eh? Well,
  Inspector, as my press-agent will tell you, I'm of rather a studious type.
  There's nothing I like better than to curl up in a corner with a good
  book&mdash;real literature, mind you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie raised a protesting hand. "The wise man, knowing he is under
  suspicion," he remarked, "does not stoop to tie his shoe in a melon
  patch."</p>

  <p>Van Horn nodded. "An old Chinese saw, eh? Not bad either."</p>

  <p>"You will," said Chan sternly, "before we leave these chairs, tell me the
  reason for your visit to library this morning."</p>

  <p>Van Horn did not reply. He sat for a moment with a frown on his handsome
  face. Then he turned with sudden decision.</p>

  <p>"You've been frank with me, Inspector. I'll be the same with you. Though
  when you've heard my reason for that visit, I fear you'll be more puzzled
  than ever." He took from his pocket an envelope bearing the crest of the
  Grand Hotel, and drew out a single sheet of note-paper. "Will you please read
  that?"</p>

  <p>Chan took the paper. It bore a brief note, type-written and unsigned. He
  read:</p>

  <p>"Just a word of warning from a friend. You should go at once to the
  Honolulu Public Library and remove from the bound volumes of all Los Angeles
  papers carrying the Denny Mayo murder story, certain rather damaging
  references to your own part in that affair."</p>

  <p>Charlie looked up. "Where did you get this?"</p>

  <p>"I found it under my door when I awoke this morning," the actor told
  him.</p>

  <p>"You went to library at once?"</p>

  <p>"Directly after breakfast. Who wouldn't? I couldn't recall that I'd ever
  been mentioned in connection with the case&mdash;there was no reason why I
  should have been. But naturally&mdash;my curiosity was aroused. I went down
  and read every word I could find regarding Mayo's murder in the Los Angeles
  Times&mdash;the only paper they had. And oddly enough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" Chan prompted.</p>

  <p>"It was just as I thought. My name wasn't mentioned anywhere. I've had a
  rather puzzled morning, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"Natural you should," nodded Charlie. "A queer circumstance, indeed. Have
  you any idea who wrote this note?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," returned Van Horn. "But the purpose of it seems to be
  clear. Somebody has sought to cast suspicion in my direction. It's a delicate
  little attention, and I appreciate it. He&mdash;or possibly she&mdash;figured
  that I would go to the library and sign for that volume, and that of course
  you would soon find it out. After that, you would fancy me deeply involved in
  this affair, and would spend precious time sleuthing in the wrong direction.
  Fortunately, you took the unusual course of coming to me at once with your
  suspicion. I'm glad you did. And I'm damned glad I kept the letter."</p>

  <p>"Which, after all, you may have written to yourself," Chan suggested.</p>

  <p>Van Horn laughed. "Oh, no&mdash;I'm not so deep as all that, Mr. Chan. The
  letter was under my door when I rose. Find out who wrote it, and you may find
  the murderer of Shelah Fane."</p>

  <p>"True enough," agreed Charlie. "I will keep it now, of course." He stood
  up. "We have had a good talk, Mr. Van Horn, and I am grateful for your
  confidence. I go my way with one more puzzle burning in my pocket. Add a few
  more, and I collapse from mental strain. I trust I have not held you away
  from luncheon."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," the actor replied. "This has been a very lucky interview for
  me. Good-by, and all my best wishes for success."</p>

  <p>Chan hastened through the palm court, and at last set his flivver on the
  road to the city. As he moved along, he thought deeply about Huntley Van
  Horn. Despite his airy manner, the actor had seemed to be open and sincere.
  But could he, Charlie wondered, be sure of that? Could he ever be sure in
  this world? Deceit sprouted everywhere and thrived like a weed.</p>

  <p>Suppose Van Horn was sincere? Who put that note under his bedroom door
  while he slept? Chan began to realize that he was engaged in a duel&mdash;a
  duel to the death. His opponent was quick and wary, cleverer than any person
  he had yet encountered in a long career. How many of these clues were false,
  dropped but to befuddle him? How many real?</p>

  <p>An inner craving told him that lunch would be a pleasant diversion; he was
  never one to put such promptings aside. But as he approached the public
  library an even greater craving assailed him&mdash;a keen desire to read for
  himself the story of Denny Mayo's murder. With a sigh for the business man's
  lunch that must languish without him a little longer, he stopped the car and
  went inside.</p>

  <p>The desk was deserted for the moment, and he turned into the reading-room
  at his right. There was just a chance that the big volume taken out by Van
  Horn early that morning was not yet restored to its place on the shelves.
  Yes&mdash;there it lay, on the table at which he had seen the picture actor
  sitting. Save for one or two children, the place was deserted. Charlie
  rapidly crossed the room and opened the book.</p>

  <p>It happened that he knew the date of the Mayo tragedy, and he sought
  immediately the issue of the subsequent morning. His eyes opened wide. Under
  an eight-column head, "Movie Actor Found Murdered in Home," a great torn gap
  stared up at him.</p>

  <p>Quickly he examined the pages, and then sat back, dazed and unbelieving.
  Every picture of Denny Mayo had been ruthlessly cut from the book.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">XVII. &mdash; HOW DENNY MAYO DIED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Chan sat motionless for a long time, deep in thought. Some
  desperate person was determined that he should not look upon the likeness of
  Denny Mayo. The captions to the pictures were for the most part intact.
  "Denny Mayo When He First Came to Hollywood." And here again: "Denny Mayo as
  He Appeared in The Unknown Sin." But in every instance the reproduction of
  the actor's face was destroyed.</p>

  <p>Who had done this thing? Huntley Van Horn? Perhaps. Yet if that were so,
  Van Horn's methods were crude and raw for so suave a gentleman. To go boldly
  to the library, ask for this volume, sign his name to the slip as he claimed
  to have done, and then mutilate the yellowed page, would be unbelievably
  naive. It invited swift and inevitable detection. It certainly did not sound
  like Van Horn.</p>

  <p>With a ponderous sigh, Charlie applied himself to the story that had
  surrounded Denny Mayo's pictures. The actor had come to Hollywood from the
  English stage, and had won immediate success. He had lived with one servant
  in a detached house on one of the best Los Angeles streets. On the night of
  the murder the servant, after completing his usual duties, took the evening
  off. He went out at eight o'clock, leaving Mayo in excellent spirits.</p>

  <p>Returning at midnight, the man let himself in through the kitchen door.
  Seeing a light in the living-room, he went there to ask if anything further
  was required of him before he went to bed. On the floor of the room he
  discovered the actor, dead some two hours. Mayo had been shot at close range
  with his own revolver, a delicate weapon which he was accustomed to keeping
  in the drawer of his desk. The revolver was lying at his side, and there were
  no finger-prints on it&mdash;neither his own nor those of any unknown person.
  No one had been seen entering or leaving the house which occupied a dark
  position under its many trees.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the following morning&mdash;and Charlie's eyebrows rose at
  this&mdash;the police had permitted the general public to swarm through the
  house. Actors, actresses, directors, producers&mdash;all friends, they
  claimed, of the dead man&mdash;had paraded through the rooms, and if any
  vital clue was still lying about it could easily have been destroyed. In any
  case, no vital clue was ever found. Those the police discovered led
  nowhere.</p>

  <p>Little was known about Mayo's past; he had come from far away, and no
  member of his family stepped forward during the investigation. It was rumored
  that he had a wife in England, but he had not seen her for several years,
  never mentioned her to his friends&mdash;might, possibly, have been divorced.
  His life in Hollywood had not been spectacular; women admired him, but if he
  returned this admiration in any instance, he had been most discreet about it.
  If any one had a grudge against him&mdash;</p>

  <p>Further along in the story, a name caught Charlie's eye and he sat up with
  sudden interest. Hastily he read on until he came to it. Mayo had been
  working in a picture, and as his leading woman he had had an actress named
  Rita Montaine. Miss Montaine was engaged to marry a certain Wilkie Ballou, a
  prominent figure in Honolulu, scion of an old family there. Some obscure
  person testified that he had overheard a quarrel between Mayo and
  Ballou&mdash;it concerned a party to which Mayo had taken Miss Montaine. But
  the witness had heard Ballou make no threats against the actor.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Ballou had been questioned. His alibi was complete, sworn to
  by Miss Montaine herself. On the night of Mayo's death the actress said that
  she and Ballou had been together from six o'clock until after midnight. They
  had taken a long ride in Ballou's car and danced together at a roadhouse far
  from the scene of the crime. She admitted that she was engaged to Ballou and
  intended to marry him soon.</p>

  <p>These two faded from the limelight. Charlie read on, through the helpless
  meanderings of a completely baffled police. He turned page after page, no new
  developments arose, and amid a frantic sputtering on the part of the
  reporters, the story gradually died out.</p>

  <p>How about that alibi of Ballou's? Sworn to by the woman who was going to
  marry him. Was she also ready to lie for him?</p>

  <p>Chan picked up the heavy volume and returned to the main room of the
  library. He laid his burden down on the desk, behind which stood a bright
  young woman. Without speaking, he opened the book and indicated the mutilated
  pages.</p>

  <p>If his aim had been to annoy the young woman, he could have found no
  better means. Her cry of dismay was immediate and heartfelt. "Who did this,
  Mr. Chan?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>Charlie smiled. "Thanks for touching faith in my ability." he remarked.
  "But I can not tell you."</p>

  <p>"It was taken out by Mr. Van Horn, the actor. This sort of thing is
  prohibited by law, you know. You must arrest him at once."</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "It was also lying on table from time Mr. Van Horn left it,
  early to-day, until well past noon. What proof have we that Van Horn
  mutilated it? I know him well, and I do not think him complete fool."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will, with your kind permission, speak to him over wire. He may be able
  to cast little light."</p>

  <p>The young woman led him to the telephone, and Chan got Van Horn at the
  hotel. He explained at once the condition in which he had found the book.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about that!" Van Horn remarked.</p>

  <p>"Alas! very little," Charlie returned. "The volume was in the intact state
  when you saw it?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. Perfectly O.K. I left it on the table about nine-thirty and
  went out."</p>

  <p>"Did you see any one known to you about place?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul. But I say, Inspector, this throws new light on that note I
  got this morning. Perhaps the intention of my unknown friend was not so much
  to involve me, as to get that volume out of the files. He&mdash;if it was a
  he&mdash;may have hoped that the thing would happen just as it has
  happened&mdash;that I would take it out and leave it where he could find it
  without himself signing a slip. Have you thought of that?"</p>

  <p>"So much to think of," Chan sighed. "Thank you for the idea." He went back
  to the desk. "Mr. Van Horn left the volume in original state. He is certain
  of that. Was it noted that any one else examined it this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," the young woman replied. "The librarian in charge of that
  room is out to lunch. Look here, Mr. Chan, you've got to find who did
  this."</p>

  <p>"Plenty busy with murder just now," Charlie explained.</p>

  <p>"Never mind your murder," she answered grimly. "This is serious."</p>

  <p>Chan smiled, but the young woman was in no mood to join him. He promised
  to do his best and departed.</p>

  <p>A glance at his watch told him that he had no time for his usual leisurely
  lunch. He had instead a sandwich and a glass of milk, then went to the
  station. The Chief was pacing the floor of the detectives' room.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Charlie," he cried. "I've been wondering where you were. Pretty
  busy this morning, I take it?"</p>

  <p>"Like fly on hot griddle," Chan answered. "And just as eager to get
  off."</p>

  <p>"Haven't got anything yet, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Have so much I am worn out," Charlie told him. "But no idea who killed
  Shelah Fane."</p>

  <p>"That's what we want," the Chief insisted. "The name&mdash;the name. Good
  lord, we ought to get somewhere pretty soon."</p>

  <p>"Maybe we will," replied Chan, with just the slightest inflection on the
  "we." He sat down. "Now I will relate morning's adventures, and it can happen
  that your keen brain will function where mine wanders lonely in the
  dark."</p>

  <p>He began at the beginning: his visit to the theater, Robert Fyfe's
  cast-iron alibi, his admission that he had given the beach-comber money in
  exchange for a painting. He mentioned his call at the library and his
  discovery there of Huntley Van Horn, then went on to the two old people on
  the terrace of the hotel, who had accounted so readily for Tarneverro's
  actions on the previous night.</p>

  <p>"They may be lying," said the Chief.</p>

  <p>Charlie shook his head. "You would not say that if you saw them. Honesty
  gleams like unceasing beacon from their eyes."</p>

  <p>"I'll judge of that for myself," remarked his superior. "What was their
  name? MacMaster? I'll talk with them later. Go on."</p>

  <p>Charlie continued. He told of finding the stub of the small cigar of a
  sort smoked only by Alan Jaynes, beneath the pavilion window.</p>

  <p>"Oh, lord," sighed the Chief. "They can't all be in it. Somebody's kidding
  you, Charlie."</p>

  <p>"You go back to singular pronoun," smiled Chan. "A moment ago it was we.
  But that was only in regard to approaching moment of success, I think."</p>

  <p>"Well, somebody's kidding us, then. Have it your own way. You got Jaynes'
  finger-prints?"</p>

  <p>"I slyly obtained same. But it was print of Smith, the beach-comber, we
  discover on window-sill."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that was something we can really act on. I sent out the word to
  pick him up right away. They'll bring him in any minute now. What have you
  been doing since then?"</p>

  <p>Charlie repeated Jessop's story about the ring, which, he pointed out,
  might mean merely the repayment of an old grudge. He showed his Chief the
  letter which Van Horn had offered in explanation of his visit to the library.
  Finally he told of the mutilation of the bound volume of the newspaper, and
  ended with the mention of Ballou and his wife in the story of the Denny Mayo
  murder case.</p>

  <p>For a long time, when he had finished, his Chief sat in silence. "Well,"
  he said at length, "according to your investigation, they're all in it, I
  guess. Good heavens, can't you draw any deductions from all this?"</p>

  <p>"Kindly state what are your deductions," answered Chan with gentle
  malice.</p>

  <p>"Me? I don't know. I'm stumped. But you&mdash;the pride of the
  force&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Kindly recall&mdash;I have never been demon for speed. While I stumble
  about this way, I am fiercely thinking. Large bodies arrive late. Grant me
  time."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do now?"</p>

  <p>"I consider a little social visit with Mrs. Ballou."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott, Charlie&mdash;watch your step. Ballou's an important man in
  this town, and he's never been very friendly to me."</p>

  <p>"I plan to use all possible diplomacy."</p>

  <p>"You'll need it, and then some. Don't offend him, whatever you do. You
  know&mdash;these old families&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie shrugged. "I have not lived in Honolulu all these years in state
  of blindness. Do not worry. I move now on feet shod with velvet, and my voice
  drips oil and honey."</p>

  <p>Kashimo came in. He walked with dragging step and had a discouraged
  air.</p>

  <p>"Well, where's this fellow Smith?" demanded the Chief.</p>

  <p>"No place, sir," said Kashimo. "Melted like ice."</p>

  <p>"Melted, hell! You go out again, and don't come back without him."</p>

  <p>"Look everywhere," Kashimo complained. "All funny joints, up-stair, in
  cellar. Comb town. No Smith."</p>

  <p>Charlie went over and patted him on the back. "If at first you have drawn
  blank, resume the job," he advised. He took a slip of paper from a desk and
  began to write. "I give you a list of unsavory places," he explained. "Maybe
  you overlook some. Perhaps, after all, I have better knowledge of city's
  wickedness than honored member of Young Men's Buddhist Association like
  yourself."</p>

  <p>He handed his list to the Japanese, who took it and left, followed by
  Charlie's kindly encouragement.</p>

  <p>"Poor Kashimo," Chan remarked. "When there is no oil in the lamp, the wick
  is wasted. In dealing with such a one, friendly words bring best results. Now
  I go forth to wallow some more in bafflement."</p>

  <p>"I'll be waiting to hear from you," his Chief called after him.</p>

  <p>Charlie set out for the Manoa Valley home of the Ballous. The business
  district disappeared behind him, and he traveled a street lined with great
  houses set on rolling lawns. Above his head flamed flowering trees, now in
  the last weeks of their splendor. He sped past Punahou Academy, and as he
  penetrated farther into the valley, he left the zone of sunshine for one of
  darkness. Black clouds hung over the mountains ahead and suddenly, borne on
  the wind, came a wild gust of rain. It beat fiercely on the top of the little
  car and blurred the windshield. Yet a mile away, at Charlie's back, Honolulu
  sparkled in the midday sun.</p>

  <p>He reached the handsome house of Wilkie Ballou, and Rita received him in
  the dark drawing-room. Her husband, she explained, was up-stairs dressing for
  his afternoon golf. In Honolulu a real golfer pays no attention to rain; it
  may be pouring on his street, but bright and sunny round the corner. Rita's
  manner was cordial, and Chan took heart.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry to obtrude my obnoxious presence," he apologized. "If you
  never saw me again, I feel sure you would like it well enough. But&mdash;mere
  matter of form&mdash;I must inflict little talk on every one present at sad
  affair last night."</p>

  <p>Rita nodded. "Poor Shelah! How are you getting on, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>"I make splendid progress," he informed her blithely. There was, he felt,
  no occasion to go into that. "Would you speak with me little while about days
  when you were famous Hollywood figure?"</p>

  <p>With bored eyes, Rita looked out at the rain lashing against the window.
  "I certainly will," she said.</p>

  <p>"May I add that you broke heart of my eldest daughter, who is great film
  fan, when you retired from silvery sheet? No one, she moans, is ever so good
  as you were."</p>

  <p>Rita's face brightened. "She remembers me? That's sweet of her."</p>

  <p>"Your fine skill will never be forgotten anywhere," Chan assured her, and
  knew that he had made a friend for life.</p>

  <p>"How can I help you?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>Chan considered. "You knew Miss Fane in Hollywood?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, quite well."</p>

  <p>"It is wisely forbidden to speak ill of those who have ascended the
  dragon, but sometimes we must let old rules go down the board. Was there at
  any time scandal in the lady's life?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, none whatever. She wasn't that sort, you know."</p>

  <p>"But she had what you call love-affairs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, frequently. She was emotional and impulsive&mdash;never without a
  love-affair. But they were all harmless, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that once she loved a man named&mdash;Denny Mayo?" Charlie
  watched Rita's face closely, and he thought she looked a little startled.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes&mdash;Shelah was rather wild about Denny at one time, I believe.
  She took it rather hard when he was&mdash;killed. You knew about that,
  perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"I know all about that," answered Chan slowly. But to his disappointment,
  the words seemed to leave the woman quite calm. "You had acquaintance with
  this Denny Mayo yourself, I think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I was in his last picture."</p>

  <p>Chan had an inspiration. "It may be you have photograph of Mayo somewhere
  among possessions?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No&mdash;I did have some old stills, but Mr. Ballou
  made me burn them. He said he wouldn't have me mooning about over the dear,
  dead past when I was&mdash;" She stopped, her eyes on the door.</p>

  <p>Charlie looked up. Wilkie Ballou, in a golf suit, was in the doorway. He
  strode grimly into the room.</p>

  <p>"What's all this about Denny Mayo?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Chan was simply asking me if I knew him," Rita explained.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Chan should mind his own business," her husband growled. He walked
  over and faced Charlie. "Denny Mayo," he said, "is dead and buried."</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "I am so sorry, but he does not stay buried."</p>

  <p>"He stays that way as far as my wife and I are concerned," Ballou
  answered, and there was a certain dignity about him as he said it.</p>

  <p>For a moment Chan looked sleepily into the hostile eyes of the
  millionaire. "Your alibi for the night of Mayo's murder," he ventured, "seems
  to have enjoyed a fine success."</p>

  <p>Ballou flushed. "Why not? It was the truth."</p>

  <p>"So naturally, it prevailed." Chan moved toward the door. "I am sorry if I
  have disturbed you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You haven't disturbed me in the least," Ballou snapped. "Just what did
  you expect to find here, anyhow?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I might chance upon photograph of Denny Mayo."</p>

  <p>"And why should you want his photograph?"</p>

  <p>"Some unknown person objects to my looking at it."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said Ballou. "Well, you won't find Mayo's picture here. Or
  anything else that will interest you, for that matter. Good day, Inspector;
  and I must ask you not to call again."</p>

  <p>Charlie shrugged. "I travel where duty takes me. Would much prefer to loll
  in station house&mdash;but can you study swimming on a carpet? No&mdash;you
  must go where waters are deep. Good day, Mr. Ballou."</p>

  <p>Rita followed him into the hall. "I'm afraid we haven't been able to help
  you," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Thanks all same," bowed Chan.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry," the woman said. "I want to see you succeed. If there was
  only something I could do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chan's eyes caught the flash of rings on her fingers. "There might be," he
  remarked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Anything," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Last night you saw Miss Shelah Fane after long separation. Quick glance
  of women catches points men despise to notice. You recall all she was
  wearing, no doubt?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course. She had on a stunning gown&mdash;ivory satin, it
  was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I speak mostly of jewels," Chan told her. "What woman is so blind she
  fails to note other woman's jewelry?"</p>

  <p>Rita smiled. "Not I. She had on a gorgeous string of pearls, and a diamond
  bracelet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And her rings?"</p>

  <p>"Only one. A huge emerald I remember seeing in Hollywood. It was on her
  right hand."</p>

  <p>"This was when you last encountered her? The young people were already in
  the water enjoying warm swim?"</p>

  <p>"Julie and that boy were&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>Charlie bowed low. "My gratitude has no bounds. Now I must go on with my
  work. Good-by."</p>

  <p>He went out into the perpetual valley rain, and turned his car toward the
  sunlit beach.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; THE BELL-MAN'S STORY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Julie and Jimmy Bradshaw sat on the white sand of Waikiki
  and gazed at an ocean that stretched, apparently empty of life, from this
  curving shore all the way to the atolls of the South Seas.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I'd better be getting along downtown," remarked the boy.
  He yawned, and dropping on his back, watched the white clouds drift lazily
  across a cobalt sky.</p>

  <p>"Picture of a young man filled with pep and energy," Julie smiled.</p>

  <p>He shuddered. "Very poor taste, my girl, introducing words like that into
  a conversation at Waikiki beach. It must be that, after all, I have given you
  a very imperfect idea of the spirit of this place. Here we loaf, we
  dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you'll never get anywhere," Julie reproved.</p>

  <p>"I'm there already," he answered. "Why should I bestir myself? When you're
  in Hawaii you've no place to go&mdash;you've reached heaven, and a change
  couldn't possibly be an improvement. So you just sit down and wait for
  eternity to end."</p>

  <p>Julie shrugged. "Is that so? Well, I'm afraid I'm not built that way.
  Great for a vacation, yes&mdash;this place is all you say of it. But as a
  permanent residence&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He sat up suddenly. "Good lord, you mean I haven't sold you on it?
  Me&mdash;the greatest descriptive writer in history&mdash;and I've failed to
  put over the big deal of my life. James J. Bradshaw strikes a
  snag&mdash;meets failure face to face&mdash;it seems incredible. Where have I
  slipped up, Julie? Haven't I made you feel the beauty of this
  island&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Beauty's all right," the girl replied. "But how about its effect on
  character? It seems to me that when you've stopped moving, you're going
  back."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," he smiled. "I went to a Rotary Club luncheon once
  myself&mdash;over on the mainland. Boys, we gotta progress or perish. Last
  year we turned out ten million gaskets, this year let's turn out fifteen.
  Make America gasket-conscious. Take it from me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What were you saying about getting back to the office?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I thought I'd cast you for the role of Eve in this
  paradise, and what a serpent you turn out to be. Getting back to the office
  is something we never do over here. We don't want to wake the poor fellows
  who didn't go out."</p>

  <p>"That's just what I've been saying, Jimmy."</p>

  <p>"But dear Mrs. Legree, you don't need to be chained to an office desk in
  order to accomplish things. You can work just as well lying down. For
  instance, a minute ago I was well started on a new appeal to tourists.
  'Come&mdash;let the laughing lei girl twine her garlands of flowers about
  your shoulders. Try your skill at riding Waikiki's surf, or just rest in lazy
  luxury&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;that's what you prefer to do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Under the nodding coco-palms.' Don't you like our coco-palms,
  Julie?"</p>

  <p>"They're interesting, but I think I prefer the redwoods. You draw a deep
  breath in a redwood forest, Jimmy, and you feel like going out and licking
  the world. Can't you see what I mean? This place may be all right for people
  who belong here&mdash;but you&mdash;how long have you been in Hawaii?"</p>

  <p>"A little over two years."</p>

  <p>"Did you intend to stay here when you came?"</p>

  <p>"Well, now&mdash;let's not go into that."</p>

  <p>"You didn't, of course. You just took the line of least resistance. Don't
  you ever want to go back to the mainland and make something of yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;at first&mdash;" He was silent for a moment. "Well, I've failed
  to make the sale on Hawaii, I guess. That will always leave a scar on my
  heart, but there's something more important. Have I sold myself? I'm keen
  about you, Julie. If you'll say the word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "Don't let's go into that, either, Jimmy. I'm not what
  you think me&mdash;I'm horrid, really&mdash;I&mdash;oh, Jimmy, you wouldn't
  want to marry a&mdash;a liar, would you?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged. "Not a professional one&mdash;no. But a clumsy amateur like
  you&mdash;why, you do it as though you'd had no experience at all."</p>

  <p>She was startled. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"All that about the ring. Why, in heaven's name, do you go on with it?
  I've been wise ever since this morning, and as for Charlie Chan&mdash;say, I
  admire the polite way he's treated you. I don't believe you've fooled him for
  a minute."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear&mdash;I thought I was rather good."</p>

  <p>"What's it all about, Julie?" the boy inquired.</p>

  <p>Tears were in her eyes. "It's about&mdash;poor Shelah. She took me in when
  I was broke and without a friend&mdash;she was always so good to me.
  I'd&mdash;I'd have done anything in the world for her&mdash;let alone tell a
  little lie."</p>

  <p>"I won't ask you to continue," Bradshaw remarked. "I don't have to. Don't
  look around. Inspector Chan of the Honolulu police is approaching rapidly,
  and something in his walk tells me that this is the zero hour for you. Brace
  up. I'm with you, kid."</p>

  <p>Charlie joined them, amiable and smiling. "Not too welcome, I think. But
  anyhow I attach myself to this little group." He sat down, facing the girl.
  "What is your opinion of our beach, Miss Julie? Here you are deep in the
  languid zone. How do you like languor, as far as you have got with it."</p>

  <p>Julie stared at him. "Mr. Chan, you have not come here to talk to me about
  the beach."</p>

  <p>"Not precisely," he admitted. "But I am firm believer in leading up.
  Suitable preparation removes the sting of rudeness. Making an example, it
  would have been undecently abrupt for me to stride up and cry: 'Miss Julie,
  why do you lie to me about that emerald ring?'"</p>

  <p>Her cheeks flushed. "You think I have been&mdash;lying?"</p>

  <p>"More than think, Miss Julie. I know. Other eyes than Jessop's saw the
  ring on Miss Fane's finger long after you immersed in waters of Waikiki last
  night."</p>

  <p>She did not reply. "Better own up, Julie," Bradshaw advised. "It's the
  best way. Charlie will be your friend then&mdash;won't you, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"Must admit feeling of friendship would suffer a notable increase," Chan
  nodded. "Miss Julie, it is not true that Miss Fane gave you that ring
  yesterday to obtain cash for it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it is," the girl insisted. "That much is true."</p>

  <p>"Then she took it back later?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;just after she returned from her interview with Tarneverro,
  about noon."</p>

  <p>"Took it back, and wore it when she died?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"After the tragedy, you again obtained possession?"</p>

  <p>"I did. When Jimmy and I found her, I went in and knelt beside her. It was
  then I took the ring."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>"You mean you won't."</p>

  <p>"I can't, and I won't. I'm sorry, Mr. Chan."</p>

  <p>"I also get deep pain from this." Charlie was silent for a moment. "Can it
  happen you removed the ring because name of 'Denny' was engraved inside?"</p>

  <p>"Wh-what do you know about Denny?"</p>

  <p>Chan sat up with sudden interest. "I will tell you, and perhaps you will
  grow frank. I have learned that Shelah Fane was in Los Angeles house the very
  night Denny Mayo was murdered there. Consequently, she knew name of killer.
  It was scandal in her past she was eager to conceal. Perhaps, to aid that
  concealment, you yourself wished name of Denny Mayo kept out of all
  discussions. A natural desire to shield your friend's reputation. But as you
  see, your actions have not availed. Now you may speak, with no injury to your
  dear benefactor."</p>

  <p>The girl was weeping softly. "Yes, I guess I might as well tell you. I'm
  so sorry you know all that. I'd have given anything to keep Denny Mayo out of
  this."</p>

  <p>"You were aware, then, of that scandal in Miss Fane's past?"</p>

  <p>"I suspected that something was terribly wrong, but I didn't know what. I
  was quite young&mdash;I had just come to Shelah&mdash;at the time of
  Denny's&mdash;accident. On the night it happened, Shelah arrived home in a
  state of hysteria, and I was there alone with her. I took care of her the
  best I could. For weeks she wasn't herself. I knew that in some way she was
  connected with Mayo's murder, but until this moment, I never learned the
  facts. I was young, as I say, but I knew better than to ask questions."</p>

  <p>"Coming to yesterday&mdash;" Chan prompted.</p>

  <p>"It was just as I told you&mdash;yesterday morning she said she must get
  hold of money at once, and she gave me the ring to sell. Then she went down
  to the Grand Hotel to see Tarneverro, and when she came back she was sort of
  hysterical again. She sent for me to come to her room&mdash;she was walking
  the floor. I couldn't imagine what had happened. 'He's a devil, Julie,' she
  cried. 'That Tarneverro's a devil&mdash;I wish I had never sent for him. He
  told me things about Tahiti and on the boat&mdash;how could he know&mdash;he
  frightened me. And I've done something terribly foolish, Julie&mdash;I must
  have been mad.' She became rather incoherent then. I asked her what it was
  all about. 'Get the emerald,' she told me. 'We mustn't sell it, Julie.
  Denny's name is inside it, and I don't want any mention of that name
  now.'"</p>

  <p>"She was hysteric, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She was often that way, but this was worse, somehow. 'Denny Mayo
  won't die, Julie,' she said. 'He'll come back to disgrace me yet.' Then she
  urged me to get the ring, and of course I did. She told me we'd find
  something else to sell later. Just then she was too upset to discuss it. In
  the afternoon, I saw her crying over Denny Mayo's picture."</p>

  <p>"Ah," cried Chan, "that was portrait of Denny Mayo mounted on green
  mat?"</p>

  <p>"It was."</p>

  <p>"Continue, please."</p>

  <p>"Last night," Julie went on, "when Jimmy and I made our terrible discovery
  in the pavilion, I thought at once of what Shelah had said. Denny would come
  back to disgrace her yet. Somehow, I thought, his death must be connected
  with Shelah's. If only his name could be kept out of it&mdash;otherwise I
  didn't know what scandal might be revealed. So I slipped Denny's ring from
  her finger. Later, when I heard mention of the photograph, I ran upstairs and
  tore it into bits, hiding them under a potted plant."</p>

  <p>Chan's eyes opened wide. "So it was you who performed that act? And
  later&mdash;when pieces of photograph scattered into wind&mdash;was it you
  who concealed large number of them?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;you've forgotten&mdash;I wasn't in the room when that
  happened. And even if I'd been there, I wouldn't have been clever enough to
  think of that. Some one came to my aid at a critical moment. Who? I haven't
  the least idea, but I was grateful when I heard about it."</p>

  <p>Chan sighed. "You have made everything a delay," he remarked, "and caused
  me to waste much precious time. I can admire your loyalty to this dead
  woman&mdash;" He paused. "Haie, I would enjoy to know such a woman. What
  loyalty she inspired. An innocent girl obstructs the police in defense of her
  memory, a man who could not have been guilty pleads to be arrested as her
  murderer, doubtless from same motive."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Robert Fyfe took those lost bits of the photograph?"
  Bradshaw inquired.</p>

  <p>Charlie shook his head. "Impossible. He had not yet arrived on scene.
  Alas! it is not so simple as that. It is not simple at all." He sighed. "I
  fear I will be worn to human skeleton before I disentangle this web. And
  you"&mdash;he looked at the girl&mdash;"you alone have melted off at least
  seven pounds."</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry," Julie said.</p>

  <p>"Do not fret. Always my daughters tell me I am too enormous for beauty.
  And beauty is, of course, my only aim." He stood up. "Well, that is that.
  Jimmy, do not let this young woman escape you. She has proved herself
  faithful one. Also, she is most unexpert deceiver I have ever met. What a
  wife she will make for somebody."</p>

  <p>"Me, I hope," Bradshaw grinned.</p>

  <p>"I hope so, too." Charlie turned to the girl. "Accept him, and all is
  forgiven between you and me. The seven pounds is gladly donated."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "That is an offer. Oh, Mr. Chan, I'm so happy that everything
  is settled between us. I didn't like to deceive you&mdash;you're so
  nice."</p>

  <p>He bowed. "Even the aged heart can leap at talk like that. You give me new
  courage to go on. On to what? Alas! the future lies hidden behind a
  veil&mdash;and I am no Tarneverro."</p>

  <p>He left them standing together beneath a hau tree, and walked slowly to
  his car. Emerging from the drive, he narrowly escaped collision with a
  trolley. "Wake up, there!" shouted the motorman in rage, and then,
  recognizing a member of the Honolulu police force, sought to pretend he'd
  never said it. Charlie waved to him and drove on.</p>

  <p>The detective was lost in a maze of doubt and uncertainty. The matter of
  the emerald ring was clear at last&mdash;but still he was far from his goal.
  One point in Julie's story interested him deeply. It had been Denny Mayo's
  picture that he had sought to put together the previous night.</p>

  <p>Up to now he had thought himself balked in that purpose by some one who
  did not wish him to know the identity of the man over whose portrait Shelah
  had wept so bitterly. But might the motive not have been the same that
  prompted the destruction of the pictures at the library? The same person,
  undoubtedly, had been busy in both instances, and that person was bitterly
  determined that Inspector Chan should not look upon the likeness of Denny
  Mayo. Why?</p>

  <p>Charlie resolved to go back and relive this case from the beginning. But
  in a moment he stopped. Too much of a task for this drowsy afternoon. "Much
  better I do not think at all," he muttered. "I will cease all activity and
  put tired brain in receptive state. Maybe subconscious mind sees chance and
  leaps on job during my own absence."</p>

  <p>In such a state of suspended mental effort he turned his car into the
  drive of the Grand Hotel and, parking it, walked idly toward the entrance. A
  stiff breeze was blowing through the lobby, which was practically deserted at
  this hour of the day.</p>

  <p>Sam, the young Chinese who rejoiced in the title of head bell-man, was
  alert and smiling. Charlie paused. There was a little matter about which he
  wished to question Sam.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are well," he said. "You enjoy your duties here, no doubt?"
  Leading up, he would have called it.</p>

  <p>"Plenty fine job," beamed Sam. "All time good tips."</p>

  <p>"You know man they call Tarneverro the Great?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty fine man. Good flend to me."</p>

  <p>Charlie regarded the boy keenly. "This morning you spoke to him in
  Cantonese. Why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>"Day he come, he say long time ago he live in China, knows Chinese talk
  plitty well. So he and I have talk in Cantonese. He not so good speaking, but
  he knows what I say allight."</p>

  <p>"He didn't seem to understand you this morning."</p>

  <p>Sam shrugged. "I don't know. This moahning I speak all the same any othah
  day he has funny look an' say don' unnahstand."</p>

  <p>"They are peculiar, these tourists," Chan smiled.</p>

  <p>"Plenty funny," admitted Sam. "All same give nice tips."</p>

  <p>Charlie strode on to the lounge, and through that to the terrace. He sat
  down there.</p>

  <p>His vacation from thinking had been brief indeed, for now he was hard at
  it again. So Tarneverro understood the Cantonese dialect. But he did not wish
  Charlie Chan, whom he was so eager to assist in the search for Shelah Fane's
  murderer, to know that he understood it. Why was that?</p>

  <p>A smile spread slowly over Charlie's broad face. Here at last was a fairly
  simple question. Tarneverro's initial act in helping to solve the murder had
  been the pointing out of the fact that the watch had been set back, and that
  the alibis for two minutes past eight were consequently worthless.</p>

  <p>But would he have done that if he had not first overheard and understood
  Charlie's conversation with the cook&mdash;if he had not known that Wu
  Kno-ching had seen Shelah Fane at twelve minutes past eight and that the
  gesture with the watch was, accordingly, useless? His prompt display of
  detective skill had seemed, at the time, to prove his sincerity. But if he
  understood Cantonese, then he was simply making a virtue of necessity and was
  not sincere at all.</p>

  <p>Charlie sat for a long time turning the matter over in his mind. Was his
  eager assistant, Tarneverro the Great, quite so eager as he appeared to
  be?</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">XIX. &mdash; TARNEVERRO'S HELPING HAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Val Martino, the director, came down the steps from the
  hotel lounge, a dashing figure in his white silk suit and flaming tie. He
  might have been the man on the cover of some steamship folder designed to
  lure hesitating travelers to the tropics. His gaze fell on Charlie, lolling
  at ease in a comfortable chair and looking as though he had not a care in the
  world. The director came over immediately.</p>

  <p>"Well, Inspector," he remarked, "I scarcely expected to see you in such a
  placid mood just now. Unless you have already solved last night's
  affair?"</p>

  <p>Chan shook his head. "Luck is not so good as that. Mystery still remains
  mystery, but do not be deceived. My brain moves, though my feet are
  still."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that," Martino replied. "And I hope it gets somewhere soon."
  He dropped into a chair at Charlie's side. "You know that thing last night
  just plain wrecked two hundred thousand dollars' worth of picture for me, and
  I ought to hurry to Hollywood on the next boat and see what's to be done
  about it. Whoever killed Shelah certainly didn't have the best interests of
  our company at heart, or he'd have waited until I finished my job. Oh,
  well&mdash;it can't be helped now. But I must get away as soon as possible,
  and that's why I'm plugging for you to solve the problem at once."</p>

  <p>Chan sighed. "Everybody seems to suffer from hurry complex. An
  unaccustomed situation in Hawaii. I am panting to keep in step. May I
  ask&mdash;what is your own idea on this case?"</p>

  <p>Martino lighted a cigarette. "I hardly know. What's yours?" He tossed the
  match on to the floor, and the old Chinese with the dust-pan and brush came
  at once, casting a look at Charlie which seemed to say: "This is exactly the
  sort of person I would expect to find in your company."</p>

  <p>"My ideas do not yet achieve definite form," Chan remarked. "One thing I
  do know&mdash;I am opposed in this matter by some person of extreme
  cleverness."</p>

  <p>The director nodded. "It looks that way. Well, there were several clever
  people at Shelah Fane's house last night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yourself included," Charlie ventured.</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Naturally, that had to come from you. But it's true enough." He
  smiled. "I am speaking, of course, in confidence when I say there was another
  man present of whose cleverness I have never had the slightest doubt. I don't
  like him, but I've always thought him pretty smooth. I refer to Tarneverro
  the Great."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "Yes, he is plenty quick. One word with him, and I had
  gathered that."</p>

  <p>The director flicked the ash from his cigarette on to the floor. The old
  Chinese brought an ash-tray and set it close beside him on the small
  table.</p>

  <p>"There are all kinds of seers and crystal-gazers fattening on the
  credulity of Hollywood," Martino continued. "But this man is the ace of the
  lot. The women go to him; and he tells them things about themselves they
  thought only God knew. As a result&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How does he discover these things?" Charlie asked.</p>

  <p>"Spies," the director answered. "I can't prove it, but I'm certain he has
  spies working for him night and day. They pick up interesting bits of news
  about the celebrities, and pass them along to him. The poor little movie
  girls think he's in league with the powers of darkness, and as a result they
  tell all. That man knows enough secrets to blow up the colony if he wants to
  do it. We've tried to run him out of town, but he's too smart for us. You
  know, I'm rather sorry I stopped Jaynes last night when he wanted to beat
  Tarneverro up. I believe it would have been a grand idea. But on the other
  hand, Shelah's name would have been dragged into it, and remembering that, I
  broke up the row. The pictures are my profession, there are lots of fine
  people in the colony, and I don't like to see them suffer from harmful
  publicity. Unfortunately the decent ones must share the disgrace when the
  riffraff on the fringe misbehaves."</p>

  <p>"Was it your intention," Chan inquired, "to hint that Tarneverro the Great
  may have killed Shelah Fane?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," responded Martino hastily. "Don't get me wrong. I was only
  trying to point out that if you sense a clever opponent in this affair, you
  should remember that there are few men cleverer than the fortune-teller.
  Further than that, I say nothing. I don't know whether he did it or not."</p>

  <p>"For the time between eight and eight-thirty last night," Chan informed
  him, "Tarneverro has most unshakable alibi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Martino stood up. "He would have. As I told you, he's as slick as they
  come. Well, so long. Good luck to you&mdash;and I mean that with all my
  heart."</p>

  <p>He strolled off toward the glittering sea and left Chan to his thoughts.
  In a few moments the detective arose with sudden decision and went to the
  telephone booth in the lobby. He got his Chief on the wire.</p>

  <p>"You very much busy now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not especially, Charlie. I've got a date with Mr. and Mrs. MacMaster here
  at five-thirty, but that's an hour away. Is anything doing?"</p>

  <p>"Might be," Chan answered. "I can not tell. But I will shortly require
  backing of your firm authority for little investigation at Grand Hotel.
  Pretty good idea if you leaped into car and rode out here at once."</p>

  <p>"I'll be right with you, Charlie," the Chief promised.</p>

  <p>Going to the house phone, Charlie called the room of Alan Jaynes. The
  Britisher answered in a sleepy tone. The detective informed him that he was
  coming up immediately to talk with him and then stepped to the hotel
  desk.</p>

  <p>"Without calling room, can you ascertain if Mr. Tarneverro is in
  residence?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The clerk glanced at the letter box. "Well, his key isn't here," he said.
  "I guess that means he's in."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," nodded Chan. "If you will be so kind, do this big favor for me.
  Secure Mr. Tarneverro on wire, and say that Inspector Chan passed through
  here in too great rush to bother himself. But add that I desire to see Mr.
  Tarneverro soon as can be in lobby of Young Hotel downtown. Say it is of
  fierce importance and he must arrive at once."</p>

  <p>The clerk stared. "Down-town?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "The idea is to remove him from this hotel for a brief space
  of time," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," smiled the clerk. "I see. Well, I suppose it's all right. I'll
  call him."</p>

  <p>Charlie went up to the room occupied by Alan Jaynes. The Britisher
  admitted him, yawning as he did so. He was in dressing-gown and slippers, and
  his bed was somewhat disheveled.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Inspector. I've just been having forty winks. Good
  lord&mdash;what a sleepy country this is!"</p>

  <p>"For the malihini&mdash;the newcomer&mdash;yes," Chan smiled. "We
  old-timers learn to disregard the summons. Otherwise we would get
  nowhere."</p>

  <p>"You are getting somewhere, then?" Jaynes asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Would not want to say that, but we are traveling at good pace&mdash;for
  Hawaii," responded Charlie. "Mr. Jaynes, I have come to you in spirit of most
  open frankness. I am about to toss cards down flat on table."</p>

  <p>"Good," Jaynes said heartily.</p>

  <p>"This morning you told me you had never been in pavilion, never even
  loitered in neighborhood of place?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I did. It's the truth."</p>

  <p>Charlie took out an envelope, and emptied on to a table the stub of a
  small cigar. "How, then, would you explain the fact that this is found just
  outside window of room in which Shelah Fane met sudden death?"</p>

  <p>Jaynes looked for a long moment at this shabby bit of evidence. "Well,
  I'll be damned," he remarked. He turned to Chan, an angry light in his eyes.
  "Sit down," he said. "I can explain it, and I will."</p>

  <p>"Happy to hear you say that," Chan told him.</p>

  <p>"This morning, when I was in my bath," the Britisher began, "about eight
  o'clock, it must have been, some one knocked on my door. I thought it was the
  house-boy, and I called to him to come in. I heard the door open, and then
  the sound of footsteps. I asked who it was, and&mdash;why the devil didn't I
  break his neck last night?" he finished savagely.</p>

  <p>"You have reference to the neck of Tarneverro the Great?" Charlie inquired
  with interest.</p>

  <p>"I have. He was here in this room, and said he wanted to see me. I was
  rather taken aback, but I told him to wait. I stood up in the tub and began a
  brisk rub-down&mdash;will you come with me to the bathroom, Mr. Chan?"</p>

  <p>Surprised, Chan rose and followed.</p>

  <p>"You will observe, Inspector, that there is a full-length mirror affixed
  to the bathroom door. With the door slightly ajar&mdash;like this&mdash;a
  person standing in the bath has a view of a portion of the bedroom&mdash;the
  portion which includes the desk. I was busy with my rub-down when I suddenly
  saw something that interested me keenly. A box of those small cigars was
  lying on the desk, with a few gone. I saw, in the mirror, Mr. Tarneverro walk
  over and help himself to a couple of them. He put them in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"Good," remarked Chan calmly. "I am much obliged to the mirror."</p>

  <p>"At first I thought it was merely a case of petty pilfering. Nevertheless,
  I was deeply annoyed, and I planned to go out and order him from my room. But
  as I finished drying myself and got into my dressing-gown, it occurred to me
  that something must be in the air. I decided to say nothing, lie low, and try
  to find out, if possible, what the beggar was up to. I didn't guess&mdash;I'm
  a bit dense, I'm afraid&mdash;it never popped into my mind that he wanted to
  involve me in Shelah's murder. I knew he had no love for me, but
  somehow&mdash;that's not the sort of thing&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well, I came out and asked him what he wanted. He looked me boldly in the
  eye and said he had just dropped in to urge that I let bygones be bygones,
  and shake hands on it. No reason why we shouldn't be friends, he thought.
  Felt that Miss Fane would wish it. Of course, I was aching to throw him from
  the window, but I controlled myself. Out of curiosity, I invited him to have
  one of my cigars. 'Oh, no, thanks,' he said. 'I never use them.'</p>

  <p>"He ran on about Miss Fane, and how it would be best if we dropped our
  enmity of last night. I was cool but polite&mdash;I even shook hands with
  him. When he had gone, I sat down to think the thing out. What could have
  been his purpose in taking those cigars? As I say, I couldn't figure it. Now,
  of course, the matter is only too clear. He proposed to scatter a few false
  clues. By gad, Inspector&mdash;why should he take the trouble to do that?
  There's just one answer, isn't there? He murdered Miss Fane himself."</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "I would be happy to join you in thinking that, but first
  several matters must be wiped away. Among others&mdash;an air-tight
  alibi."</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell&mdash;what's that?" Jaynes cried. "A clever man always has an
  alibi." His heavy jaws snapped shut. "I appreciate what Mr. Tarneverro tried
  to do for me&mdash;I do, indeed. When I see him again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When you see him again, you will make no noise," Charlie cut in. "That
  is, if you wish to be of help."</p>

  <p>Jaynes hesitated. "Oh&mdash;very good. But it won't be easy. However, I'll
  hold my tongue if you say so. Was there anything else you wanted?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks. You have supplied me with plenty. I go on my way with renewed
  energy."</p>

  <p>Waiting for the elevator, Chan thought about Jaynes' story. Was it true?
  Perhaps. It seemed a rather glib explanation, but was the Britisher clever
  enough to concoct such a tale on the spot? He appeared to be a stolid,
  slow-thinking man&mdash;always going somewhere to be by himself and figure
  things out. Could such a man&mdash;Charlie sighed. So many problems!</p>

  <p>He stepped cautiously from the elevator and peered round the corner. The
  coast seemed to be clear and he went to the desk. "Has Mr. Tarneverro
  departed?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>The clerk nodded. "Yes&mdash;he went out a moment ago, in a great
  hurry."</p>

  <p>"My warmest thanks," Charlie said.</p>

  <p>His Chief was coming up the hotel steps, and he went to greet him.
  Together they sought out a secluded corner.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" the Chief wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"Number of things," Chan replied. "Mr. Tarneverro bursts into
  investigation and demands our strict attention."</p>

  <p>"Tarneverro?" The Chief nodded. "That fellow never has sounded good to me.
  What about him?"</p>

  <p>"For one point," Charlie answered, "he understands Cantonese." He told of
  making that discovery, which had served to turn his thoughts toward the
  fortune-teller. "But since I called you, even more important evidence leaps
  up," he added. Briefly he repeated Jaynes' story about the cigars.</p>

  <p>The Chief whistled. "We're getting there, Charlie," he cried.</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "You overlook Tarneverro's alibi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't. I'll attend to that later. By the way, if you see that old
  couple from Australia about, keep out of their way. I've arranged for them to
  come to my office, as I told you, and I don't want to talk with them here. We
  can handle them better amid the proper surroundings. Now, what is it you want
  to do?"</p>

  <p>"I desire," Chan answered, "to make complete search of Tarneverro's
  apartment."</p>

  <p>The Chief frowned. "That's not quite according to Hoyle, Charlie. I don't
  know. We have no warrant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which is why I asked you to come. Big man such as you are can arrange it.
  We leave everything as we found it, and Tarneverro will not know."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Charlie explained the fortune-teller's present whereabouts. The Chief
  nodded. "That was a good idea. Wait here, and I'll have a talk with the
  management."</p>

  <p>He returned presently, accompanied by a tall lean man with sandy hair.
  "It's all fixed," the Chief announced. "You know Jack Murdock, don't you,
  Charlie? He's going with us."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Murdock old friend," Chan said.</p>

  <p>"Well, Charlie, how you been?" Murdock remarked. He was an ex-policeman,
  now one of the house detectives for the hotel.</p>

  <p>"I enjoy the usual good health," Charlie replied, and with the Chief,
  followed Murdock.</p>

  <p>After the house detective had unlocked the door and admitted them to
  Tarneverro's sitting-room, he stood looking at Chan with a speculative
  eye.</p>

  <p>"Not going to rob us of one of our most distinguished guests, are you,
  Charlie?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Chan smiled. "That is a matter yet to be determined."</p>

  <p>"Quite a little affair down the beach last night," Murdock continued. "And
  you're in the limelight, as usual. Some people have all the luck."</p>

  <p>"Which they pay for by having also all the worry," Chan reminded him. "You
  are in soft berth here. Fish course last night was excellent. Did you taste
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"So did I&mdash;and that was as far as I got," sighed Chan. "Limelight has
  many terrible penalties." He glanced about the room. "Our object is to search
  thoroughly and leave no trace. Fortune favors, however, for we have plenty
  time."</p>

  <p>He and the Chief went to work systematically, while the house detective
  lolled in a comfortable chair with a cigar. The closets, the bureau drawers
  and the desk were all gone over carefully. Finally Charlie stood before a
  trunk. "Locked," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Murdock got up. "That's nothing. I've a skeleton key that will fix it." He
  opened the trunk, which was of the wardrobe variety, and swung it wide. Chan
  lifted out one drawer, and gave a little cry of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Here is one thing we seek, Chief," he cried, and produced a portable
  typewriter. Placing it on the desk, he inserted a sheet of note-paper and
  struck off a few sentences. "Just a word of warning from a friend. You should
  go at once to the Honolulu Public Library and&mdash;" He finished the note,
  and taking another from his pocket, compared the two. With a pleased smile he
  carried them to his Chief.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly regard these missives and tell me what they suggest to
  you?" he said.</p>

  <p>The Chief studied them for a moment. "Simple enough," he remarked. "Both
  were written on the same machine. The top of the letter e is clogged with
  ink, and the letter t is slightly out of alignment."</p>

  <p>Chan grinned and took them back. "Long time confinement in station house
  does not cause you to grow rusty. Yes&mdash;it is just as you say. Two notes
  are identical, both being written on this faithful little machine. Happy to
  say our visit here is not without fruit. I must now put typewriter in place
  so our call will go unsuspected. Or would go that way, if it was not for
  lingering odor of good friend Murdock's cigar."</p>

  <p>The house detective looked guilty. "Say, Charlie&mdash;I never thought of
  that."</p>

  <p>"Finish your weed. Damage is now done. But take care luxury of present job
  does not cause brain to stagnate."</p>

  <p>Murdock did not smoke again, but let the cigar go out in his hand. Charlie
  continued to explore the trunk. He had about completed his search without
  further good fortune, when in the most remote corner of the lowest
  compartment, he came upon something which seemed to claim his interest.</p>

  <p>He walked up to his Chief. In the palm of his hand lay a man's ring, a
  large diamond in a heavy setting of gold. His superior stared at it. "Take
  good look," Chan advised, "and fix same in your mind."</p>

  <p>"More jewelry, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "Seeking to solve this case, it seems we wander lost in jewel
  store. Natural, perhaps, since we deal with Hollywood people." He restored
  the ring to its place, closed the trunk and locked it. "Mr. Murdock, that
  will end business here."</p>

  <p>They returned to the lobby, where the house detective left them. Chan
  accompanied the Chief out to the drive.</p>

  <p>"What did you mean about the ring, Charlie," asked the latter.</p>

  <p>"Little story which I have been perhaps too reluctant to repeat," smiled
  Chan. "Why? Perhaps because it concerns most distasteful moment of my long
  career. You will recall that last night, in house down the beach, I stood in
  middle of floor with letter written by Shelah Fane held firmly in my hand.
  Suddenly light goes out. I am most rudely struck in the face&mdash;struck and
  cut on the cheek, proving the assailant wore a ring. Lights go on, and the
  letter is gone."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," cried the Chief impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Immediately I make a survey&mdash;of the men in the room, who wears ring?
  Ballou and Van Horn&mdash;yes. Others do not. Mr. Tarneverro, for example,
  does not. Yet yesterday morning, when I visited him in room, I noted that
  ring I have called to your attention, on his finger. What is more, when we
  rode down to Shelah Fane's house after news of murder, I perceived the
  diamond gleaming in the dark. I saw it again when he helps me make
  investigation in pavilion. Yet when lights flash on after theft of letter,
  ring is no longer in evidence. What would be your reaction to that, Mr.
  Chief?"</p>

  <p>"I should say," the Chief returned, "that Tarneverro struck that blow in
  the dark."</p>

  <p>Charlie was thoughtfully rubbing his cheek. "Oddly enough," he remarked,
  "such was my own reaction."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">XX. &mdash; ONE CORNER OF EVIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They went over and stood by Charlie's car. A puzzled frown
  wrinkled the Chief's brow. "I don't get this, Charlie."</p>

  <p>"On which point," returned Chan placidly, "we are like as two reeds
  bending beside stream."</p>

  <p>"Tarneverro hit you. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Maybe he feels athletic."</p>

  <p>"He'd just been telling you about that letter&mdash;hoping that the two of
  you would run across it somewhere&mdash;and when you got it he knocked you
  down and took it away from you."</p>

  <p>"No doubt he wished to examine it in private."</p>

  <p>The Chief shook his head. "Beyond me&mdash;way beyond me. He stole a cigar
  from Jaynes, hurried down and dropped the butt outside the pavilion window.
  He wrote a note to Van Horn, sending him off to the library on a fool's
  errand. He&mdash;he&mdash;what else has he done?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he has murdered Shelah Fane," Charlie suggested.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he did."</p>

  <p>"Yet he owns fine alibi."</p>

  <p>The Chief looked at his watch. "Yes&mdash;I'll attend to that alibi at
  five-thirty, if those old people show up as they promised. What are you going
  to do now?"</p>

  <p>"I follow you to join in that interview, but first I make stop at public
  library."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, of course. Come as soon as you can. I&mdash;I think we're
  getting somewhere now."</p>

  <p>"Where?" inquired Chan blandly.</p>

  <p>"Lord knows&mdash;I don't," replied the Chief, and hurried to his own car.
  He got away first, and Charlie followed him through the big gates to Kalakaua
  Avenue.</p>

  <p>It was nearly five o'clock, the bathing hour at Waikiki was on, and along
  the sidewalk passed a perpetual parade of pretty girls in gay beach robes and
  stalwart tanned men in vivid dressing-gowns. Other people had time to enjoy
  life, Charlie reflected, but not he. The further discoveries of the afternoon
  baffled him completely, and he had need of all his oriental calm to keep him
  firmly on the pathway of his investigation. Tarneverro, who had sworn that
  his dearest wish was to assist in finding the murderer of Shelah Fane, had
  been impeding the search from the start. The fortune-teller's dark face, with
  its deep mysterious eyes, haunted Chan's thoughts as he flivvered on to
  town.</p>

  <p>Stopping at the public library, he again appeared at the desk.</p>

  <p>"Would you kindly tell me if the young woman in charge of reading-room is
  now on scene?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl appeared, upset and indignant over the morning's events. She
  would never again leave a newspaper file idle on a table, but the Japanese
  boy whose work it was to return such items to the shelves was taking the day
  off. She remembered Van Horn, of course; she had seen him in the films.</p>

  <p>"Were other striking personalities present in reading-room during the
  morning?" Charlie inquired.</p>

  <p>The girl thought. Yes&mdash;she remembered one. A rather peculiar-looking
  man&mdash;she recalled especially his eyes. Chan urged her to a further
  description, and was left in no doubt as to whom she referred.</p>

  <p>"Did you perceive him examining newspaper file left by actor?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. He came in soon after Mr. Van Horn left, and stayed all
  morning, reading various papers and magazines. He seemed to be trying to pass
  the time."</p>

  <p>"When did he leave?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He was still here when I went out to lunch."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," Chan nodded. "He would be."</p>

  <p>"You think he cut the book?"</p>

  <p>"I have no proof, and never will have, I fear. But I am sure he mutilated
  the volume."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see him in jail," said the girl warmly.</p>

  <p>Charlie shrugged. "We have tastes in common. Thank you so much for
  significant information."</p>

  <p>He drove quickly to the police station. The Chief, alone in his room, was
  gruffly talking over the telephone. "No&mdash;no&mdash;nothing yet." He
  slammed the receiver on to its hook. "Good lord, Charlie, they're hounding me
  to death. The whole world wants to know who killed Shelah Fane. The morning
  paper's had over a hundred cables. Well, what about the library?&mdash;Wait a
  minute."</p>

  <p>The telephone was ringing again. The Chief's replies were none too
  gentle.</p>

  <p>"That was Spencer," he announced, hanging up. "I don't know what's got
  into the boys&mdash;they seem to be helpless. They can't find a trace of that
  confounded beachcomber anywhere. He's of vital importance, Charlie; he was in
  that room last night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie nodded. "He must assuredly be found. I am plenty busy man, but it
  seems I must go on his trail myself. As soon as interview with old people is
  ended&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good! That's the ticket. You go out the first chance you get. What was I
  saying?&mdash;Oh, yes&mdash;the library. What did you find there?"</p>

  <p>"No question about it," Charlie replied. "Tarneverro is man who destroyed
  pictures of Denny Mayo."</p>

  <p>"He is, eh? Well, I thought so. Doesn't want you to know what this Mayo
  looked like. Why? I'll go mad if this keeps up. But there's one thing sure,
  and I'm clinging to it. Tarneverro's our man. He killed Shelah Fane, and
  we've got to pin it on him." Chan started to speak. "Oh, yes&mdash;I
  know&mdash;his alibi. Well, you watch me. I'll smash that alibi if it's the
  last act of my life."</p>

  <p>"I was going to name one other objection," Chan told him gently.</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"If he contemplated killing of Shelah Fane, why did he announce first to
  me that we are about to arrest killer of Denny Mayo? Why, as my boy Henry
  would say, bring that up?"</p>

  <p>The Chief put his head in his hands. "Lord, I don't know. It's a difficult
  case, isn't it, Charlie?" A plain-clothes man appeared at the door,
  announcing Mr. Thomas MacMaster and wife. "Show them in," cried the Chief,
  leaping to his feet. "We can do one thing, anyhow, Charlie," he said. "We can
  smash that alibi, and when we've done that, maybe things will clear up a
  bit."</p>

  <p>The old Scotch couple entered, and at the guileless and innocent look of
  them, the Chief received a severe shock. The old man approached Chan with
  outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"Ah, good evening, Mr. Chan. We meet again."</p>

  <p>Charlie got up. "Would you kindly shake hands with the Chief of
  Detectives. Mrs. MacMaster, I would also present my superior officer to you.
  Chief desires to ask a few polite questions." He stressed the polite ever so
  slightly, but his superior got the hint.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, madam," he said cordially. "Mr. MacMaster&mdash;I am sorry
  to trouble you."</p>

  <p>"No trouble at all, sir," replied the old man, with the rolled r of
  Aberdeen. "Mother and I have never had much to do wi' the police, but we're
  law-abiding citizens and glad to help."</p>

  <p>"Fine," returned the Chief. "Now, sir, according to what you told
  Inspector Chan here, you are both old friends of the man who calls himself
  Tarneverro the Great?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;that we are. It was in his younger days we knew him, and a
  splendid lad he was. We're deeply fond of him, sir."</p>

  <p>The Chief nodded. "Last night you say you sat with him on one of the
  lanais of the Grand Hotel from a few minutes after eight until half past the
  hour."</p>

  <p>"That is what we said, sir," MacMaster returned, "and we will swear to it
  in any court you put us in. It is the truth."</p>

  <p>The Chief looked him firmly in the eye. "It can't be the truth," he
  announced.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why, what do you mean, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I mean there's a mistake somewhere. We have indisputable evidence that
  Mr. Tarneverro was elsewhere during that time."</p>

  <p>The old man drew himself up proudly. "I do not like your tone, sir. The
  word of Thomas MacMaster has never been questioned before, and I have not
  come here to be insulted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't question your word. You've made a mistake, that's all. Tarneverro
  left you at eight-thirty, you claim. Did you verify that by your own
  watch?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"The watch might have been wrong."</p>

  <p>"It was wrong."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"It was a wee bit fast&mdash;a matter of three minutes. I compared it with
  the hotel clock, which stood at eight-thirly-two."</p>

  <p>"You're not&mdash;pardon me&mdash;a young man, Mr. MacMaster?"</p>

  <p>"Is that also forbidden by law in the States, sir?"</p>

  <p>"What I mean is&mdash;your eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My eyes, sir, are as good as yours, and better. Mr. Tarneverro left us at
  eight-thirty&mdash;the correct time. He had been with us since we came out
  from our dinner, save for a brief period when he talked with a gentleman at
  the far end of the lounge. And during that time he did not leave our sight.
  That I say&mdash;and that I'll stand by"&mdash;he banged a great fist on the
  desk&mdash;"until hell freezes over!"</p>

  <p>"Father&mdash;don't get excited," put in the old lady.</p>

  <p>"Who's excited?" cried MacMaster. "You have to be emphatic wi' a
  policeman, Mother. You have to talk his language."</p>

  <p>The Chief considered. In spite of himself, he was impressed by the obvious
  honesty of the old man. He had planned to bully him out of his testimony, but
  something told him such tactics would be useless. Hang it all, he reflected,
  Tarneverro did have an alibi, and a good one.</p>

  <p>"You second what your husband says, madam?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Every word of it," the old lady nodded.</p>

  <p>The Chief made a helpless gesture, and turned toward MacMaster. "All
  right," he remarked. "You win."</p>

  <p>Charlie stepped forward. "May I have honor to address few remarks to these
  good friends of mine?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Sure. Go ahead, Charlie," replied the Chief wearily.</p>

  <p>"I make simple inquiry," Chan continued gently. "Mr. Tarneverro was young
  man starting career when he visited your ranch, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"He was that," agreed MacMaster.</p>

  <p>"An actor on theatrical stage?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;and not a very successful one. He was glad of the work wi'
  us."</p>

  <p>"Tarneverro very odd name. Was that what he called himself when he worked
  with you?"</p>

  <p>The old man glanced quickly at his wife. "No, it was not," he said.</p>

  <p>"What name did he offer at that time?"</p>

  <p>MacMaster's jaw shut hard, and he said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I repeat&mdash;what name did he offer when he worked with you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Inspector," the old man replied. "But he has asked us not to
  refer to the matter."</p>

  <p>Chan's eyes flashed with sudden interest. "He requests that you do not
  mention his real name?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He said he had done wi' it, and asked us to think of him as Mr.
  Tarneverro."</p>

  <p>Charlie felt his way carefully. "Mr. MacMaster, a serious situation looks
  us hard in the face. Murder was done last night. Tarneverro is not guilty
  man. You prove same yourself by offer of alibi, which is accepted by us in
  sincere spirit, because we know it is spoken same way. You have performed
  that favor for him. You do it gladly because you love truth. But more even
  dear friend has no right to ask of you. You have said you are law-abiding,
  and no one exists who is stupid enough to doubt that. I wish to know Mr.
  Tarneverro's name when he was with you in Australia."</p>

  <p>The old man turned uncertainly to his wife. "I&mdash;I don't know. This is
  a difficult position, Mother."</p>

  <p>"You will not prove him murderer by giving it," Charlie continued.
  "Already you have saved him from that. But you will impede our work if you
  withhold same&mdash;and I am plenty certain you are not kind of man to do
  that."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," the Scotchman muttered. "Mother, what do you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"I think Mr. Chan is right." She beamed upon Charlie. "We have done enough
  when we swear to his alibi. If you won't tell, Father, I will. Why should a
  man be ashamed of his real name?&mdash;And it was his real name, I'm
  sure."</p>

  <p>"Madam," said Chan. "You have proper view of things. Deign to mention the
  name."</p>

  <p>"When we knew Tarneverro on the ranch," continued the old lady, "his name
  was Arthur Mayo."</p>

  <p>"Mayo!" cried Chan. He and the Chief exchanged a triumphant glance.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He told you this morning he was alone when he came to work for us. I
  can't think why he said that&mdash;it wasn't true. You see, he and his
  brother came to us together."</p>

  <p>"His brother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course&mdash;his brother, Denny Mayo."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">XXI. &mdash; THE KING OF MYSTERY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Chan's breath came a little faster as he listened to this
  unexpected bit of news. Tarneverro was Denny Mayo's brother! No wonder, then,
  that the fortune-teller had been so eager to learn from Shelah Fane the name
  of Mayo's murderer. No wonder he had offered to help Chan to the limit of his
  ability in the task of finding out who had silenced Shelah just as she was,
  supposedly, on the point of telling.</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;had he carried out that promise to assist? On the contrary,
  he had evidently been placing in Chan's way every obstacle possible. Puzzles,
  puzzles&mdash;Charlie put his hand to his head. This man Tarneverro was the
  king of mystery.</p>

  <p>"Madam, what you say is very interesting," the detective remarked. His
  eyes brightened. On one point, at least, light was breaking. "Will you be
  kind enough to tell me&mdash;was there resemblance in features between those
  two men?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Aye, there was, though many people might not have noticed,
  because of the difference in age and coloring. Denny was blond, and Arthur
  very dark. But the first time I saw them, standing side by side in my
  kitchen, I knew they were brothers."</p>

  <p>Chan smiled. "You have contributed something to our solution, madam,
  though up to moment of present speaking, only the gods know what. I think
  that is all we now require of you. Do I speak correctly, Chief?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right, Charlie. Mr. MacMaster, I'm obliged to your wife and
  you for this visit."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, sir," the old man answered. "Come, Mother. I&mdash;I'm not
  quite comfortable about this. Perhaps you've talked a wee bit too much."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Thomas. No honest man is ashamed of his name&mdash;and I'm sure
  Arthur Mayo is honest. If he's not, he's sore changed from what he was when
  we knew him." The old lady rose.</p>

  <p>"As for the alibi," her husband said stubbornly, "we stick to
  that&mdash;through thick and thin. Tarneverro was with us from eight to
  eight-thirty, and if the murder was done in that half-hour, he didn't do it.
  To that I'll swear, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I suppose you will," the Chief replied. "Good evening,
  sir. Madam&mdash;a great pleasure to meet you."</p>

  <p>The old couple went out, and the Chief looked at Charlie. "Well, where are
  we now?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Tangled in endless net, as always," Chan answered. "One thing I
  know&mdash;Tarneverro waits for me at Young Hotel. I will call him at once
  and request his presence here."</p>

  <p>When he had done so, he came back and sat down beside his superior. His
  brows were contracted in thought.</p>

  <p>"The case spreads itself," he remarked. "Tarneverro was Denny's brother.
  That ought to give us big boost toward our solution, but other way about, it
  only increases our worry. Why did he not tell me that? Why has he, as matter
  of fact, fiercely struggled to keep it from me? You heard what lady said
  about resemblance. That explains at once why all pictures of Mayo were torn
  to bits. Tarneverro was willing to travel long length to make sure we do not
  discover this fact just related to us." He sighed. "Anyhow, we have learned
  why portraits were destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that doesn't get us anywhere," the Chief replied. "If it was his
  brother who was killed, and he was on the point of asking you to arrest the
  murderer as soon as Shelah Fane revealed the name, I'd think that he would
  naturally tell you of his connection with Mayo&mdash;especially after the
  news of Miss Fane's death. It would have been a logical explanation of his
  interest in the case. Instead of telling you, he tries desperately to keep
  the relationship hidden." The Chief paused. "Strange none of these Hollywood
  folks ever noticed a resemblance between Mayo and the fortune-teller."</p>

  <p>Chan shook his head. "Not likely they would. The two visit town at widely
  separated times, and were not seen together there. Many people, Mrs.
  MacMaster said, would not note the resemblance, but Tarneverro flatters me by
  assuming I am one who would. As for others, he knows well it is the kind of
  likeness almost no one sees until it is pointed out. Then everybody sees it.
  Human nature is like that."</p>

  <p>"Human nature is getting to be too much for me," growled the Chief. "What
  course do you propose to take with this fortune-teller when he gets
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I plan to walk softly. We will say nothing about his many misendeavors,
  but we will speak of this thing we have just learned. What reasons will he
  give for his silence? They may have vast significance."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know, Charlie. It might be better to keep him in the dark
  even on that point."</p>

  <p>"Not if we pretend we hold no suspicion whatever. We will assume instead a
  keen delight. Now we know he has every reason to help us, and the skies
  brighten above our weary heads."</p>

  <p>"Well, you handle him, Charlie."</p>

  <p>A few moments later Tarneverro strode debonairly into the room. His manner
  was aloof and a bit condescending, as though he found himself in quaint
  company but was man of the world enough to be at home anywhere. He nodded at
  Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Inspector, I waited for you a long time. I'd about given you up."</p>

  <p>"A thousand of my humblest apologies," Chan returned. "I was detained by
  heavy weight of business. May I present my honored Chief?"</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller bowed. "A great pleasure. How are you getting on,
  Inspector? I've been very eager to know."</p>

  <p>"Natural you should be. Only a moment ago did we upearth fact which makes
  us realize how deep your interest is."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro glanced at him keenly. "What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I mean we discover that Denny Mayo was your brother."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro stepped over and laid his walking-stick on a desk. The act, it
  seemed, gave him a moment for thought.</p>

  <p>"It's true, Inspector," he remarked, facing Chan again. "I don't know how
  you found it out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie permitted himself a quiet smile of satisfaction. "Not many things
  remain buried through investigation such as we are making," he remarked
  gently.</p>

  <p>"Evidently not." Tarneverro hesitated. "I presume you are wondering why I
  didn't tell you this myself?"</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "Undoubtedly you possessed good reason."</p>

  <p>"Several reasons," the fortune-teller assured him. "For one thing, I
  didn't believe that such knowledge would help you in any way in solving the
  case."</p>

  <p>"Which is sound thinking," Chan agreed readily. "Still&mdash;I must
  confess slight hurt in my heart. Frankness between friends is like warm sun
  after rain. The friendship grows."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro nodded and sat down. "I suppose there's a great deal in what
  you say. I'm rather sorry I kept the relationship to myself, and I apologize
  most humbly. If it's not too late, Inspector, I will give you the whole story
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all too late," Chan beamed.</p>

  <p>"Denny Mayo was my brother, Inspector, my youngest brother. The
  relationship between us was more like that of father and son. I was intensely
  fond of him. I watched over him, helped his career, took pride in it. When he
  was brutally murdered, the shock was a terrible one for me. So you can easily
  understand why I say"&mdash;his voice trembled with sudden
  passion&mdash;"that to avenge his death has been for three years my chief
  aim&mdash;indeed my only aim. If the person who killed Shelah Fane is the
  same man or woman who murdered Denny&mdash;then, by heaven, I can not rest
  until justice is done."</p>

  <p>He rose and began to pace the floor.</p>

  <p>"When I heard the news of Denny's murder, I was playing in a London
  production. There was nothing I could do about it at the moment&mdash;I was
  too far away. But at my earliest opportunity I went to Hollywood, determined
  to solve the mystery of his death. I thought that the chances of my doing so
  would be better if I did not arrive in the picture colony as Denny's brother,
  but under an assumed name. At first I called myself Henry Smallwood&mdash;it
  was the name of a character I had lately played.</p>

  <p>"I looked around. The police, it was evident, were completely at sea on
  the case. Gradually I became impressed by the number of seers and
  fortune-tellers of various sorts in Hollywood. They all seemed to be
  prospering, and it was rumored that they were the recipients of amazing
  confidences and secrets from the lips of the screen people.</p>

  <p>"A big idea struck me. In my younger days I had been an assistant to
  Maskelyne the Great, one of a long line of famous magicians, and a man of
  really remarkable powers. I had some talent in a psychic way, had told
  fortunes as an amateur and had the nerve to carry the thing through. Why not,
  I thought, take an impressive name, set myself up as a crystal-gazer, and by
  prying into Hollywood's secrets, seek to solve the mystery of poor Denny's
  death? The whole thing looked absurdly simple and easy."</p>

  <p>He sat down again.</p>

  <p>"So for two years, gentlemen, I have been Tarneverro the Great. I have
  listened to stories of unrequited love, of overwhelming ambition, of hate and
  intrigue, hope and despair. It has been interesting, many secrets have been
  whispered in my ear, but until recently the one big secret I longed to hear
  was not among them. Then, out of a blue sky, yesterday morning at the Grand
  Hotel, my moment came. I finally got on the trail of Denny's murderer. It
  took all my will power to control myself when I realized what was happening.
  Shelah Fane told me she was in Denny's house that night&mdash;she saw him
  murdered. I had difficulty restraining myself&mdash;I wanted to leap upon her
  then and there and wring the name of his killer from her reluctant lips.
  Three years ago I would have done it&mdash;but time&mdash;well, we grow
  calmer with the passage of time.</p>

  <p>"However, once I discovered she knew, I would never have left her until
  she told. When you saw me last night, Inspector, my hopes were running high.
  I proposed to take you with me to her home after the party, and between us I
  felt certain we could drag out that name at last. I intended to hand the
  guilty person over to you immediately, for"&mdash;he looked at the
  Chief&mdash;"I need hardly tell you that I have never thought of avenging the
  crime in any other manner. From the first, I proposed to let the courts deal
  with Denny's killer. That was, of course, the only sane way."</p>

  <p>The Chief nodded gravely. "The only way, of course."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro turned toward Chan. "You know what happened. Somehow this
  person discovered that Shelah was on the verge of telling, and silenced her
  for ever. On the very threshold of triumph, I was defeated. Unless you find
  out who killed poor Shelah, my years of exile in Hollywood will very likely
  go for nothing. That's why I'm with you&mdash;that's why I want"&mdash;his
  voice trembled again&mdash;"the murderer of Shelah Fane more than I've ever
  wanted anything in all my life before."</p>

  <p>Charlie looked at him with a sort of awe. Was this the man who had been
  scattering all those false clues about the place?</p>

  <p>"I am glad of this frankness, lately as it arrives," the detective said,
  with an odd smile.</p>

  <p>"I should have told you at once, I presume," Tarneverro continued. "I was,
  as a matter of fact, on the point of explaining my relationship to Denny as
  we rode down to Shelah's house. But, I reflected, the information would not
  help you in the least. And I did not want it to become known why I was
  telling fortunes in Hollywood. If it did, of course my career there would be
  ended. Suppose, I said to myself, Inspector Chan fails to find Shelah Fane's
  murderer. In that case I must go back to Hollywood and resume my quest. They
  are still coming to me with their secrets. Diana Dixon consulted me to-day.
  That is why, until Denny's murderer is found, I do not want my real name made
  public. I rely on you gentlemen to be discreet."</p>

  <p>"You may do so," Chan nodded. "Matter remains buried as though beneath
  Great Wall of China. Knowing how firmly you are with us in this hunt adds on
  new hope. We will find Shelah Fane's murderer, Mr. Tarneverro&mdash;and your
  brother's all same time."</p>

  <p>"You are making progress?" asked the fortune-teller eagerly.</p>

  <p>Charlie regarded him fixedly. "Every moment we are approaching nearer. One
  or two little matters&mdash;and we are at journey's end."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Tarneverro heartily. "You know now my stake in the affair. I
  hope you will forgive me that I didn't reveal it fully at the start."</p>

  <p>"Explanation has been most reasonable," smiled Chan. "All is forgiven. I
  think you may now be excused."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Tarneverro glanced at his watch. "It is getting on toward the
  dinner hour, isn't it? I'm sorry that what I have told you is of no vital
  importance in your search. If there were only some really valuable
  contribution that I could make&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "Understand your feeling plenty well. Who knows? Your
  opportunity may yet arise." He escorted Tarneverro from the room, and out the
  front door of the station house.</p>

  <p>When he returned, the Chief was slumped down in his chair. He looked up
  with a wry smile. "Well," he remarked, "what was wrong with that
  picture?"</p>

  <p>Charlie grinned. "Pretty much everything," he responded. "Tarneverro
  plenty queer man. He wants to help&mdash;so he robs cigar from Mr. Jaynes and
  drops same outside pavilion window. He thirsts for my success&mdash;so he
  writes note that causes me to waste time on innocent Mr. Van Horn. He has
  mild little reason, of no importance, for not telling me he is Denny Mayo's
  brother&mdash;but he rages about destroying pictures of Denny as though he
  would keep matter from me or die in the attempt. He beholds letter in which
  may be written name of Denny's killer, and when I am about to open it, he
  kicks out light and smashes me in face." Chan rubbed his cheek thoughtfully.
  "Yes, this Tarneverro plenty peculiar man."</p>

  <p>"Well, where do we go from here?" the Chief inquired. "It begins to look
  like one of your stone walls, Charlie."</p>

  <p>Chan shrugged. "In which case, we circle about, seeking new path. Me, I
  get renewed interest in beach-comber. Why was he in pavilion room last night?
  More important yet, what was conversation he overheard between Shelah Fane
  and Robert Fyfe, for suppression of which Fyfe pays handsome sum?" He moved
  toward the door. "Kashimo has now played his game of hide-and-seek long time
  enough. I go to bestow inside small quantity of provisions, and after that I
  myself will do a little scouring of this town."</p>

  <p>"That's the talk," his Chief cried. "You go after that beach-comber
  yourself. I'll eat down-town too, and come back here as soon as I've
  finished. You'll find me here any time after seven."</p>

  <p>Charlie went to the telephone and called his house, getting his daughter
  Rose on the wire. He announced that he would not be home for dinner. A sharp
  cry of protest answered him.</p>

  <p>"But, Dad,&mdash;you must come home. We all want to see you."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;at last you begin to feel keen affection for poor old
  father."</p>

  <p>"Sure. And we're dying to hear the news."</p>

  <p>"Remain alive a small time longer," he advised. "There are no news as
  yet."</p>

  <p>"Well, what have you been doing all day?" Rose wanted to know.</p>

  <p>Chan sighed. "Maybe I should put my eleven children on this case."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you should," she laughed. "A little American pep might work
  wonders."</p>

  <p>"That is true. I am only stupid old Oriental&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who says you are? I never did. But Dad, if you love me, please
  hurry."</p>

  <p>"I will speed," he answered. "If I do not, I perceive I can not come home
  to-night."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver and went to a near-by restaurant, where he ate a
  generous dinner.</p>

  <p>Refreshed and fortified, he was presently strolling down King Street
  toward Aala Park. Dusk was falling over that littered stretch of ground, the
  campus of the undergraduates in the hard school of experience. They lolled
  about on the benches, some of them glancing up at Charlie with hostile eyes
  under discreetly lowered lids. There was muttering as he passed, an
  occasional curse from the lips of some one who had met the detective under
  circumstances none too pleasant. He paid no attention to any of them&mdash;he
  was seeking a man in a velvet coat and duck trousers that had once been
  white.</p>

  <p>The Park yielded nothing. He crossed to a street of mean shops and shabby
  business. Above his head, on a fragile balcony, an enormous Filipino woman in
  a faded kimono puffed on an after-dinner cigar. Charlie moved along into a
  section of Honolulu quite unknown to tourists who breathed the pure air of
  the beach and raved about the beauty of these islands.</p>

  <p>There was no beauty in the River District, only squalor and poverty; seven
  races jumbled together in an international slum. He heard voices raised in
  bitter argument, the weeping of children, the clatter of sandals, and, even
  here, the soft whine of Hawaiian music. The Song of the Islands floated
  lazily on the fetid air. Over a doorway that led to a dark and dirty stair,
  he saw the sign: "Oriental Cabaret."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment in the glare of the lights that formed this sign. A
  girl was approaching, dark-skinned, slender, graceful. He stood aside to let
  her pass, and saw her face. The tropics, lonely islands lost in vast southern
  seas&mdash;a lovely head against a background of cool green. Quickly he
  followed her up the stairs.</p>

  <p>He came into a bare room with a sagging roof. There were many tables with
  blue and white checkered cloths; painted girls were eating at the rear. A
  suave little proprietor came forward, rubbing his hands with outward calm,
  but somewhat disturbed inside.</p>

  <p>"What you want, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>Charlie pushed him aside and followed the girl he had seen below. She had
  taken off her hat and hung it on a nail; evidently she worked here.</p>

  <p>"Begging your pardon," Chan began.</p>

  <p>She looked at him, fear and defiance mingling in her smoldering eyes.
  "What you want?"</p>

  <p>"You are acquainted with haole&mdash;white man&mdash;Smith, the
  beach-comber?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>"He painted your portrait&mdash;I have seen it. A beautiful thing."</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged. "Yes, he come here, sometimes. I let him make the
  picture. What of it?"</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Mr. Smith lately?"</p>

  <p>"Not for long time&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"Where does he live?"</p>

  <p>"On the beach, I think."</p>

  <p>"But when he has money&mdash;where then?"</p>

  <p>The girl did not reply. The proprietor came forward. "You tell him,
  Leonora. Tell Inspector what he asks you to."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well. Sometimes he live at Nippon Hotel, on Beretania Street."</p>

  <p>Chan bowed. "Thank you so much." He wasted no time in that odorous
  cluttered room, but hastened down the dark stair. In a few moments he entered
  the Nippon Hotel. The sleek little Japanese behind the desk greeted him with
  a cordiality Chan knew was rankly insincere.</p>

  <p>"Inspector, you honor my house."</p>

  <p>"Such is not my purpose. Haole named Smith&mdash;he stops here?"</p>

  <p>The clerk took a register from beneath the desk. "I look see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie reached out and took the book from his slightly resisting hands.
  "I will see. Your eyes are notably bad. Archie Smith, room seven. Lead me
  there."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Smith out, I think."</p>

  <p>"We will discover if he is. Please make haste."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly the Japanese led him across an open courtyard, filled with a
  neglected tangle of plants and flowers. The Nippon Hotel was a cluster of
  shabby sheds, antiquated outbuildings. They stepped on to a lanai; a Japanese
  woman porter, bent low under a heavy tin trunk, staggered by. The clerk moved
  on into a musty hallway, and pointed to a door. The numeral seven&mdash;or
  what was left of it&mdash;hung by one nail on the panel.</p>

  <p>"In there," said the Jap, and with a hostile look, disappeared.</p>

  <p>Chan opened the door of number seven, and entered a dim low-ceilinged
  room. One dirty bulb was burning over a pine table, and at that table sat
  Smith, the beach-comber, with a canvas on his knees. He looked up,
  startled.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said. "So it's you?"</p>

  <p>Chan regarded him sleepily. "Where you been all day?"</p>

  <p>Smith indicated the canvas. "The evidence is right here, Inspector. I've
  been sitting in my palatial studio painting that courtyard outside. Glad you
  dropped in&mdash;it's been a bit dull since I finished." He leaned back in
  his chair and critically surveyed his work. "Come and look at this,
  Inspector. Do you know, I believe I've got something into it&mdash;a certain
  miasmic quality. Did you ever realize before that flowers can look mean and
  sinister? Well, they can&mdash;in the courtyard of the Nippon Hotel."</p>

  <p>Chan glanced at the painting and nodded. "Yes, plenty good, but I have no
  time to be critic now. Get your hat and come with me."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going&mdash;to dinner? I know a place on the Boulevard St.
  Germain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We go to the station house," Charlie replied.</p>

  <p>"Wherever you say," nodded Smith, and putting aside the canvas, picked up
  his hat.</p>

  <p>They crossed Aala Park to King Street. Chan regarded the derelict with an
  almost affectionate gaze. Before he and Smith parted company again, the
  beach-comber was going to tell him much&mdash;enough, perhaps, to solve his
  problem and put an end to all his worries.</p>

  <p>The Chief was alone in the detectives' room. At sight of Charlie's
  companion, he brightened visibly. "Ah, you got him. I thought you would."</p>

  <p>"What's it all about?" Smith asked jauntily. "I'm flattered, of course, by
  all these attentions, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said the Chief. "Take off that hat." Thank heaven, here was
  some one who needn't be handled any too gently. "Look at me. A woman was
  killed last night at Waikiki, in a separate building on the grounds of her
  home. What were you doing in the room where she was killed?"</p>

  <p>Beneath the yellow beard, Smith's face paled. He wet his lips with his
  tongue. "I was never in that room, Chief."</p>

  <p>"You lie! We found your finger-prints on the window-sill. Look at me. What
  were you doing in that room?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come on, brace up. You're in a tight place. Tell the truth, or you'll
  swing for this. What were you doing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right," said Smith in a low voice. "I'll tell you about it. Give me a
  chance. I didn't kill anybody. It's true, I was in that room&mdash;in a
  way."</p>

  <p>"In a way?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I opened the window and climbed up on the sill. You see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Kindly start at beginning," Chan cut in. "We know you arrived at window
  of pavilion to hear man and woman talking inside. What was said we pass over
  for the minute. You heard the man leaving the room&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and I went after him. I wanted to see him&mdash;but he got into
  a car and drove away down the avenue. I couldn't catch him. So I ambled back
  and sat down on the beach. Pretty soon I heard a cry&mdash;a woman's
  cry&mdash;from that pavilion. I didn't know what to do. I waited a while, and
  then I went over and looked through the window. The curtain was down, but it
  flapped about. Everything was quiet&mdash;I thought the place was empty. And
  then&mdash;well, really&mdash;I'm a little embarrassed about this. I'd never
  done such a thing before. But I was desperate&mdash;strapped&mdash;and when
  you're that way you get the feeling, somehow, that the world owes you a
  living&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get on with it," barked the Chief.</p>

  <p>"Well, just inside the window I caught a glimpse of&mdash;of a diamond
  pin. I thought there was no one inside, so I pushed up the screen and climbed
  on to the sill. I stooped over and picked up the pin&mdash;and then I saw
  her&mdash;the woman&mdash;lying over there by the table&mdash;stabbed, dead.
  Well, of course I realized at once that was no place for me. I lowered the
  screen, hid the pin in a little secret safety-deposit box of mine on the
  beach, and strolled as casually as I could to the avenue. I was still moving
  when that cop picked me up, an hour later."</p>

  <p>"Is pin still on beach?" Chan inquired.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I got it this morning." Smith reached into his trousers pocket
  and produced it. "Take it quick&mdash;I don't want it&mdash;don't let me ever
  see it again. I must have been crazy, I guess. But as I say&mdash;when you're
  down and out&mdash;" Charlie was studying the pin. It was a delicate affair,
  a row of fine diamonds set in platinum. He turned it over. The pin itself was
  broken midway, and the end of it was lost.</p>

  <p>The Chief was looking sternly at the beach-comber. "Well," he said, "you
  know what this means. We'll have to lock you up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment, please," broke in Charlie. "Finding of pretty pin is good
  enough, but it is not vital to us. Vital matter is, what did this man hear
  Shelah Fane and Robert Fyfe saying to each other while he lingered outside
  pavilion window? Something of great importance&mdash;something Mr. Fyfe made
  false confession to quiet&mdash;something he has paid Mr. Smith nice sum to
  conceal. But now Mr. Smith changes mind. He will not conceal it any
  longer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I will," cried Smith. "I mean&mdash;it was
  nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We hold you for theft," cut in Charlie. "Do you enjoy prisons? I think
  not. Neither does territory enjoy supporting you there. Under a certain
  circumstance, memory of theft might fade from our minds for ever. Am I
  speaking correctly, Chief?"</p>

  <p>The Chief was dubious. "You think it's as important as that, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"It is of vast importance," Chan replied.</p>

  <p>"All right." He turned to the beach-comber. "Tell us the truth of what you
  heard last night, and you can go. I won't press the charge. But&mdash;it's
  got to be the truth, this time."</p>

  <p>Smith hesitated. His rosy dream of the mainland, decent clothes,
  respectability, was dying hard. But he shuddered at the thought of Oahu
  Prison.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said at last. "I'll tell you. I hate to do it,
  but&mdash;oh, well&mdash;there's Cleveland. My father&mdash;a punctilious
  man. Easily annoyed&mdash;growing old, you know. I've got to get out of this
  jam for his sake, if not for my own. When I came up to that window,
  Inspector&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chan raised his hand. "A moment, please, I have keen desire to see Robert
  Fyfe in this room when you tell the story." He looked at his watch. "I can
  reach him at hotel, I think. Excuse me." He took up the telephone and
  summoned Fyfe. Then he went over and sat down in a chair at the
  beach-comber's side. "Now we will rest as comfortable as may be. You, Smith,
  explore your mind and arrange story in advance. Kindly remember&mdash;the
  truth."</p>

  <p>The beach-comber nodded. "You're on, Inspector. The truth this time." He
  looked down at his battered shoes. "I knew it was too good to last. Got a
  cigarette? No? Neither have I. Oh, well, life's like that."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">XXII. &mdash; WHAT THE BEACH-COMBER HEARD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They sat in silence, and the minutes dragged by. Smith's
  pale gray eyes stared hopelessly into the future, a future where he walked
  for ever, broke and forlorn, along a curving beach. Lighting a big cigar, the
  Chief picked up the evening paper. Charlie Chan took the diamond bar pin from
  his pocket and studied it, deep in thought.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed, and then Robert Fyfe entered the room. He came in as
  though he were stepping on to a stage: suave, smiling, sure of himself. But
  as his gaze fell upon Smith the smile faded suddenly, and a frown replaced
  it.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," the actor said. "I can give you about twenty minutes, Mr.
  Chan, and then I must run. It wouldn't do to be late at the theater again
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Twenty minutes will be ample plenty," nodded Charlie. "Mr. Smith and
  yourself have met before. Over here sits my Chief."</p>

  <p>Fyfe bowed. "Ah, yes. I take it you have called me here for some important
  reason, Inspector?"</p>

  <p>"Seems important to us," Chan answered. "I will squander no words. Last
  night you hold famous conversation with ex-wife in beach pavilion. The true
  contents of that talk have not yet been revealed. First when matter is
  discussed, you confess to crime you did not do, in order to change subject.
  Then, this morning, you discover yourself sudden lover of art, and buy
  picture from Smith, hoping to keep him quiet." He looked fixedly at the
  actor. "I rejoice you got nice painting, Mr. Fyfe. Because that will be all
  you get. Smith can not longer keep quiet. Smith is about to speak."</p>

  <p>A look of distress crossed the actor's face, and was succeeded by one of
  anger. He wheeled about and faced the beach-comber. "You
  contemptible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Smith raised a protesting hand. "I know&mdash;I know. What a broken reed
  I've turned out to be. I'm as sorry about this as you are, old man. But these
  keen lads here have got something on me&mdash;something rather
  serious&mdash;it means prison unless I ditch you. And I've slept in the pure
  open air so much&mdash;somehow a prison cot doesn't appeal to me. Frightfully
  sorry, as I said, but I'm going to throw you over. By the way, have you got a
  cigarette?"</p>

  <p>Fyfe glared at him for a moment, and then, shrugging his shoulders, opened
  a silver case and held it out. Smith helped himself.</p>

  <p>"Thanks. It's a wretched affair, Mr. Fyfe, and&mdash;no, that's all right,
  I've got a match&mdash;the sooner we get it over with, the better." He
  lighted the cigarette, and took a long pull at it. "To return to our favorite
  subject&mdash;last night on the beach&mdash;I went up to that pavilion window
  and they were in there together&mdash;this man and Shelah Fane. She was doing
  most of the talking&mdash;got a look at her&mdash;lovely, even more so than
  in the films. I'd rather like to have painted her&mdash;wearing that
  cream-colored gown&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come, come," cried the Chief. "Get on with it."</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm trying to do. I just wanted to point out how beautiful
  she was&mdash;a woman like that ought to be allowed at least
  one&mdash;shot."</p>

  <p>Chan stood up. "What is your meaning now?"</p>

  <p>"I mean she'd taken it, anyhow. She was telling Mr. Fyfe all about
  it&mdash;how three years ago, in Hollywood, she killed a man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a groan Fyfe sank into a chair, and covered his face with his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Killed what man?" the Chief demanded.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;the name." Smith hesitated. "Denny, I think she called him.
  Yes, that was it&mdash;Denny Mayo."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's tense silence, and then Fyfe leaped to his feet. "Let
  me tell this," he cried. "It will sound dreadful, if he tells it. Let me
  explain about Shelah&mdash;she was emotional, impetuous. I'll try to make you
  understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't care who tells it," said the Chief. "But I want it told, and
  quick."</p>

  <p>Fyfe turned to Chan. "You heard, Inspector, how she called me at the
  theater&mdash;a distracted, pitiful call&mdash;and said she must see me at
  once. I answered that I'd come after the show, but she said no, that might be
  too late. If I'd ever loved her, I must come at once. She had something to
  tell me, she wanted my advice, she was desperate. So&mdash;I went.</p>

  <p>"I met her on the lawn; she seemed overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. We
  went to the pavilion and she burst at once into her story. Some years after
  our divorce, she told me, she met this Denny Mayo&mdash;she fell madly in
  love with him&mdash;I could picture it. I knew how Shelah loved. Wildly,
  unreasonably. Mayo seemed to care for her; he had a wife in London, a dancer
  in musical comedies, but he promised to divorce her and marry Shelah. For a
  time Shelah was happy&mdash;and then one night Mayo asked her to come to his
  house.</p>

  <p>"That was three years ago&mdash;a night in June. She went to his place at
  the hour he had suggested. He told her that he was through; that his wife had
  had an accident and was unable to work any longer; that he believed he owed a
  duty to this woman&mdash;at any rate he was going to write her to join him in
  Hollywood. Poor Shelah went a little mad then. Quite out of her senses. There
  was a revolver in the drawer of Mayo's desk, she got it, pointed it at him,
  threatened to kill him and herself. I have seen her in such moments; she was
  not responsible, I know. They struggled over the weapon, it went off in her
  hand. She stood looking down at Mayo, dead at her feet.</p>

  <p>"She came to her senses then, I fancy. At any rate, she took her
  handkerchief and removed her fingerprints from the gun. She stole out of the
  house and went home unobserved. She was safe. Not once did the investigation
  point to her. Safe&mdash;but never happy again. From that day she lived in
  torment.</p>

  <p>"A few weeks ago, in Tahiti, she met Alan Jaynes. She wanted to marry him,
  but she was haunted by that memory of the past. She'd fallen into the habit
  of consulting this fellow Tarneverro about everything; he had impressed her
  deeply with his cleverness. She sent for him to meet her here, and yesterday
  morning she went to his apartment.</p>

  <p>"When she went there, she had no intention of telling him anything about
  Denny Mayo. She merely wanted him to read her future, to advise her as to
  whether a marriage with Jaynes would turn out happily. But he&mdash;he seemed
  to exert some mysterious power over her. Perhaps he hypnotized her. In any
  case, the first thing she knew, she found herself confessing the whole
  terrible story to the fortune-teller&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" cried Chan, with unaccustomed bruskness. "Ah, pardon me&mdash;one
  moment, please. You mean to say she told Tarneverro that she herself killed
  Denny Mayo?"</p>

  <p>"Of course she did. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But Tarneverro relates different story."</p>

  <p>"Then he lies. Shelah confessed to him that she had killed
  Denny&mdash;don't you understand&mdash;that's why she was so frightened, why
  she sent for me. I was the only one she could turn to, she said. She hadn't
  liked the light she saw in Tarneverro's eyes when she made her confession.
  She was deathly afraid of the man. She was sure he planned to use that
  confession in some way that would do her infinite harm. She clung to me,
  pleaded for my help. But what could I do? What was there to be done?"</p>

  <p>Fyfe sat down as though exhausted by his story. "I tried to reassure her,
  promised to help her all I could&mdash;but I pointed out to her that I must
  get back to the theater at once. She begged me to stand by, stay with
  her&mdash;but you know, gentlemen, the show must go on. I had never
  disappointed an audience in my life&mdash;I refused to do it then. I left her
  and returned to town."</p>

  <p>Again Fyfe buried his face in his hands. "If I had only stayed with
  her&mdash;but I didn't. The next thing I heard, poor Shelah
  was&mdash;murdered. I intended to tell the police the whole story at once,
  but somehow&mdash;when it came right down to it&mdash;I couldn't. Shelah, who
  had always been so straight and fine, such a good pal, so generous and kind.
  I pictured that blot on her past, that wild thing she had done in one
  irresponsible moment, cabled to the ends of the earth. She was gone. To find
  her murderer would never bring her back. No, I thought, keep Shelah's name
  unsullied. That's your job now.</p>

  <p>"Then this accursed beach-comber came in and started his story. I went a
  little mad myself. I'd always loved Shelah&mdash;I loved her still&mdash;more
  than ever when I saw her last night. So I made my melodramatic confession to
  shut off the investigation. I don't know whether I'd have gone through with
  it or not&mdash;this morning when I woke up it seemed that I had carried
  chivalry a bit too far. Fortunately for me, I didn't have to go through with
  it&mdash;Mr. Chan disproved my confession on the spot. But I had succeeded in
  my purpose; I had given Smith here a tip, and when he came to me to-day I was
  ready and willing to pay all I had to keep him quiet. I couldn't bear the
  thought of Shelah disgraced before the world that had so greatly admired
  her."</p>

  <p>Charlie got up and laid his hand on the actor's shoulder. "You have caused
  me much trouble but I forgive freely, for you are gallant gentleman. Pardon
  me if I grow tiresome with much pounding on one point, but it is of vast
  importance. You are quite sure that Miss Fane told her story to Tarneverro
  exactly as she told it to you?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Fyfe replied. "And if you can find any connection between
  Tarneverro and Denny Mayo, then the fortune-teller killed her. That's
  certain."</p>

  <p>Charlie exchanged a long look with his Chief. The latter turned to Smith.
  "You can go along," he said. "And don't let me see you here again."</p>

  <p>The beach-comber rose quickly. "You won't&mdash;not if it's left to me,"
  he remarked. "Of course, if you keep dragging me in&mdash;" He walked over to
  Fyfe. "I really am sorry, old man. I want you to know&mdash;in one respect at
  least I kept my word&mdash;I haven't had a drink all day. I sat in my
  room&mdash;money in my pocket&mdash;sat there and painted a lot of
  wicked-looking flowers, with my throat as dry as the Sahara. It was a tough
  assignment, but I came through it. Who knows&mdash;maybe I've got a chance
  yet. Here"&mdash;he took a roll of bills from his pocket&mdash;"this is
  yours."</p>

  <p>"Why, what is it?" Fyfe asked.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-two bucks&mdash;all I've got left of the fifty. Sorry it isn't
  more, but I bought a bit of canvas and some brushes&mdash;a chap can't just
  sit in a room, you know."</p>

  <p>Fyfe stood up, and pushed the money away. "Oh, that's all right. It was a
  rather good painting&mdash;that's how I feel about it. Keep the money and get
  yourself some decent clothes."</p>

  <p>Smith's pale gray eyes shone with gratitude. "By heaven&mdash;you're a
  gentleman. It does a fellow good to meet you. I feel something stirring
  within me&mdash;can it be a great resolve? They tell me there's a scarcity of
  stewards on the boats. To-morrow morning I'll buy myself some new things, and
  sign on for the trip to the coast. San Francisco&mdash;it's only a short walk
  from there to Cleveland. Yes&mdash;by the lord&mdash;I'll do it."</p>

  <p>"Good luck to you," Fyfe answered.</p>

  <p>"Thanks. May I trouble you&mdash;one more cigarette? You're very kind." He
  moved to the door, stopped and came back. "Somehow, Chief, I don't like to
  leave you. Will you do me a favor?"</p>

  <p>The Chief laughed. "I might," he said.</p>

  <p>"Lock me up until morning," the beach-comber went on. "Don't let me go
  into the street with all this money on me. I might be held up, or
  possibly&mdash;possibly&mdash;What I mean is, put me in a safe place
  overnight, and the chances of getting rid of me tomorrow will be a lot better
  than they look right now."</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," nodded the Chief. "Come with me."</p>

  <p>Smith waved a hand at Charlie Chan. "Remind me in the morning, Inspector,
  I owe you a dime&mdash;ten cents." He followed the Chief from the room.</p>

  <p>Charlie turned to Fyfe. "You are now in demand at playhouse. I am deeply
  grateful for all you have told."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Chan&mdash;if you could only keep this thing about Shelah from
  reaching the public&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Charlie shook his head. "I am so sorry, but I fear same can not be done.
  The matter has vital connection with her murder."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it has," Fyfe sighed. "Well, anyhow, you've been mighty decent
  to me, and I appreciate it."</p>

  <p>Chan bowed him out.</p>

  <p>Left alone, the detective stared thoughtfully into space. He was standing
  thus when the Chief strode again into the room. For a moment they regarded
  each other.</p>

  <p>"Well," the Chief said, "so Tarneverro's story was a lie. And you've based
  your whole investigation on it. It's not like you, Charlie, to be tricked
  like that."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "If I had time to do so, I would droop my head in shame.
  However, I choose now to forget the past. From this point on, my
  investigation takes new turn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;from this point on?" his Chief demanded. "The case
  is ended&mdash;don't you know that?"</p>

  <p>"You think so?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of it. In the morning Shelah Fane tells Tarneverro she killed
  Denny Mayo. Mayo was his brother. In the evening, she's found murdered. What
  could be simpler than that? I'm going to arrest the fortune-teller at
  once."</p>

  <p>Charlie raised his hand. "No, no&mdash;I advise against that. You forget
  his alibi, solid as stone wall, not to be shaken."</p>

  <p>"We'll have to shake it. It's evidently false. It must be. Either those
  old people are lying to save him, or else he tricked them as he tricked
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not think so," Chan said stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you, Charlie? Losing your grip? We never had a
  clearer case than this. The little matter of the alibi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Something else, too," Chan reminded him. "Why did Tarneverro say he would
  call me down the beach to arrest a murderer? His words stick in my mind and
  will not be unlodged. I tell you firmly, this problem not yet solved."</p>

  <p>"I can't understand you, Charlie."</p>

  <p>"Only one thing made clear by Mr. Fyfe's interesting story. I know now why
  Mr. Tarneverro did not wish me to open letter written by Shelah Fane. He
  feared I would learn at once his tale of seance with the lady was false in
  details, and house of cards would tumble about his ears. Fortunate for him,
  letter when finally opened was so worded as to add strength to his lie.
  'Please forget what I told you this morning. I must have been mad&mdash;mad.'
  Then he knew that blow struck in the dark was not needed, after all. Must
  have wished to give himself a few resounding kicks." Chan paused. "Yes, Mr.
  Tarneverro has muddled me with his deceit from very start. Still, I do not
  believe him guilty of murder."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you propose to do?" the Chief demanded. "Just sit here and
  twiddle your thumbs, with me to help you?"</p>

  <p>"I am no thumb-twiddler," replied Chan with spirit. "I propose to
  act."</p>

  <p>"On what? We have no more clues."</p>

  <p>Charlie took the diamond pin from his pocket. "We have this." He handed it
  over. "Will you kindly oblige by making study of same?"</p>

  <p>The Chief examined it. "The pin itself is broken in the middle, isn't it?
  Half of it seems to be gone."</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "Undubitably gone. And when we find that missing end, our
  case is solved."</p>

  <p>The Chief looked puzzled. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"How was pin broken? When watch was smashed, murderer wished to provide
  further evidence of struggle that might make smashing of watch more probable.
  So he tore off orchid flowers and trampled them beneath foot. When he ripped
  off flowers, pin unfastened and came with them. No doubt it lay on floor,
  point uppermost. Perhaps that point drove deep into heel of murderer's shoe,
  and broke off there. Did this happen, and did it go unnoticed by killer? It
  might. If so, there may be tell-tale scratches on polished floors of house at
  Waikiki. I speed there at once to look for same."</p>

  <p>The Chief pondered. "Well, there might be something in it, at that. I'll
  give you a chance to find out. Go along, and I'll wait here for news."</p>

  <p>In the doorway, Charlie encountered Kashimo. The little Japanese was worn
  and dispirited. "Have combed town twenty, maybe fifty, times. Mr. Smith no
  longer exists."</p>

  <p>"A fine detective you are," growled the Chief. "Smith is out there in a
  cell now. Charlie found him."</p>

  <p>Disappointment and distress showed in the eyes of the Japanese. Charlie
  paused at the door and came back. He patted the little man's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Cheer yourself up," he said kindly. "Be good boy, attend all meetings of
  Y.M.B.A., and you will yet win success. Nobody is perfect. Take look at me.
  Twenty-seven years on force, and I am nowhere near so clever as I thought I
  was."</p>

  <p>He walked slowly from the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; THE FATEFUL CHAIR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Charlie rode out to the beach for what he hoped would be his
  final call at Shelah Fane's house. The moon had not yet risen, the sky was
  purple velvet pierced by ineffectual stars, the flowering trees hid their
  beauty somewhere in the calm breathless dark. Twenty-four hours ago, in this
  same period of impenetrable night before the coming of the moon, the black
  camel had knelt at Shelah Fane's gate.</p>

  <p>Though he knew now the secret in the woman's past, knew that she had done
  a grievous wrong, he still thought of her with the deepest sympathy. She had
  never stood in court to answer for her crime, but she had suffered none the
  less. What torture those three years must have been! "Perhaps in the end I
  may find a little happiness. I want it so much"&mdash;thus she had written in
  her last pitiful note. Instead she had found&mdash;what? The black camel
  waiting to carry her away into the unknown.</p>

  <p>Whatever the motive behind her murder may have been, Chan reflected, the
  act itself was heartless and cruel. He was firmly resolved that the person
  who had killed her should be found and made to pay. Found&mdash;but how?
  Would the little pin resting in his pocket come nobly to his aid? He hoped
  desperately that it would, for it was his sole reliance now.</p>

  <p>The banyan tree's shade was like ink on the front lawn of the huge
  rambling building that had been the famous star's last home. Chan parked his
  car, switched off its lights, and leaped nimbly to the ground.</p>

  <p>Jessop, serene and dignified as ever, let him in. "Ah, Constable, I was
  rather expecting you. What a pleasant evening to be abroad. Mild and
  fragrant, I should call it, sir."</p>

  <p>Chan smiled. "I am too busy man, Jessop, to have concern with perfumes of
  the night."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, I presume your time is fairly well occupied, Constable. Is
  there&mdash;if I may make bold to inquire&mdash;any news regarding the
  homicide?"</p>

  <p>Chan shook his head. "Not up to present moment."</p>

  <p>"I regret to hear that, sir. The young people are on the beach&mdash;Miss
  Julie and Mr. Bradshaw, I mean. Whom did you wish to interrogate?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to interrogate the floors of this house," Chan told him.</p>

  <p>Jessop raised his white eyebrows. "Indeed, sir. My old father used to say
  that walls have ears&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Floors, also, may repeat a story," Charlie returned. "If you have no
  inclination for objecting, I will begin in living-room."</p>

  <p>He pushed through the heavy curtains. Diana Dixon was sitting at the
  piano, softly playing. She got up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hello," she said. "You want somebody?"</p>

  <p>"I want somebody very much," Chan nodded. "At end of trail I hope to find
  him&mdash;or her."</p>

  <p>"Then you haven't yet discovered who killed poor Shelah?"</p>

  <p>"I have not. But subject is unhappy one. Why are you not on beach? That is
  place for youth at this hour?"</p>

  <p>Diana shrugged. "What's the beach without a man? And there aren't enough
  to go round, evidently."</p>

  <p>"A situation rare in your neighborhood, I will wager," Charlie smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, a change does us all good." She watched him as he stood there,
  looking impatiently about the room. "What are you going to do now? I'm so
  thrilled by all this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, I am going to be unbearably rude," he replied. "I find myself in
  uncredible position of wanting to dispense with your company. Will you kindly
  wait on the lanai?"</p>

  <p>She pouted. "I hoped you were going to ask me to help you."</p>

  <p>"In such charming company as yours, I fear I could not keep mind on work."
  He held open the French window. "As a very great favor, please&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With obvious reluctance she went out, and he closed the window after her.
  He did not wish to appear undignified in the presence of a witness, and it
  was his intention now to be undignified indeed. He turned on all the lights
  in the room and with some difficulty, got down on his knees. Taking a
  magnifying-glass from his pocket, he began a close scrutiny of the highly
  polished floor wherever it was uncovered by rugs.</p>

  <p>For a long time he crept about, until his knees ached. But he did not mind
  that, for his efforts were richly rewarded. Here and there he encountered
  numerous little scratches which had been, without doubt, recently made. He
  breathed hard, and his black eyes shone with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a brighter idea struck him. He scrambled to his feet and hurried
  to the dining-room. The table, he was happy to note, was the same size it had
  been on the previous evening. Jessop was putting away silver in the
  sideboard. He turned.</p>

  <p>"I observe," Chan remarked, "that you have not yet reduced size of dining
  table."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't, sir," replied the butler. "All the leaves are already out.
  The former occupants of this house, it would appear, were of a most
  hospitable temperament."</p>

  <p>"Just as well," nodded Chan. He was pleased to see that the big table
  stood on the bare floor; the room was without rugs save for a small one that
  lay in the doorway. "Do me a great favor, if you will, Mr. Jessop. Kindly
  place ten chairs about this board, in identical positions they occupied last
  night."</p>

  <p>Puzzled, Jessop obeyed. When he had finished, Charlie stood for a moment
  in deep speculation.</p>

  <p>"They now stand just as they did when you served dinner guests with
  coffee, some twenty-two hours ago?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the butler assured him.</p>

  <p>Without a word, Charlie pulled back a chair and disappeared beneath the
  table. One by one, mute evidence of his activity there, the chairs were
  pushed away, while Jessop stared with an amazement rarely seen on his
  imperturbable face. With a flash-light added to his equipment, Chan made the
  long circuit. Finally he came up as though for air.</p>

  <p>"Were place-cards used for last night's dinner?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. It was a rather informal affair, and Miss Fane told me she would
  seat the guests herself."</p>

  <p>"Then when they came in here for coffee, they sat in no prearranged
  order?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, sir. They just sat anywhere their fancy dictated."</p>

  <p>"Is there chance you happen to remember who sat in which place?"</p>

  <p>Jessop shook his head. "I'm sorry, Constable. It was a somewhat disturbing
  evening. I was a bit&mdash;unnerved, I fear."</p>

  <p>Charlie laid his hand on the chair at the right of the one the hostess
  would no doubt have occupied. "You can not, then, tell me who it was reclined
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not, Mr. Chan. One of the gentlemen. I fancy.
  But&mdash;I&mdash;I really don't know."</p>

  <p>Charlie studied a moment. "Thank you so much. The telephone is in the hall
  closet, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I will show you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No need to trouble," Chan told him. "I will find it."</p>

  <p>He went out to the hall and shutting himself in the hot cubby-hole under
  the stairs, made numerous calls. Finally he rang up his Chief.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Chan speaking," he said. "May I humbly suggest that you bring
  one other good man with you, and come immediately to house of Shelah
  Fane?"</p>

  <p>"Something doing, Charlie?" asked the Chief.</p>

  <p>Chan pulled the door shut as far as it would go. Little beads of
  perspiration began to pop out on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Pin is about to lead us to success," he replied in a low voice. "On floor
  of living-room repose plenty fresh scratches. What is more, during time of
  investigation last night, guests who expected to enjoy dinner sat down round
  dining table for abbreviated repast. Floor is bare beneath table, and in
  front of one chair&mdash;and only one&mdash;more scratches are in
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"Who sat in that chair?" the Chief demanded.</p>

  <p>"The murderer of Shelah Fane," Chan answered. "The name I do not yet know.
  But I have just now summoned to house six guests, who, with three already
  here, make up complete list. When all are assembled we lead them to
  dining-room and ask them, please; to sit where they did last night. Chair of
  dead hostess was at head of table, facing door to hall. Note who sits down in
  chair at right of hostess. Same will be person we so hotly seek."</p>

  <p>The Chief laughed. "Going to make a big drama out of it, eh, Charlie?
  Well, that's all right with me, so long as it means success. I'll be with you
  pronto."</p>

  <p>Chan returned to the hall, mopping his brow. He caught a glimpse of the
  coat-tails of Jessop, hastily disappearing through the curtains of the
  dining-room door. With an idle step he moved along, and came finally to the
  lanai, where he encountered Miss Dixon.</p>

  <p>"Living-room is again at your disposal," he bowed.</p>

  <p>She rose and came toward him. "Did you find what you were looking for?"
  she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>He shrugged. "Who in this world finds what he looks for?
  Success&mdash;what is it? A bubble that explodes when touched by human hand."
  And he strolled off toward the beach.</p>

  <p>At his right, as he crossed the lawn, lay the pavilion, dark and empty
  to-night. Close by the sea, seated together in a beach chair intended for one
  person only, he came upon Julie and Jimmy Bradshaw. The boy rose.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's good old Charlie," he cried. "Honolulu's noted sleuth. How are
  you, and what's the news?"</p>

  <p>"News seems to be that spell of Waikiki Beach is still intact," Chan
  answered. "I am so sorry to interrupt this touching scene."</p>

  <p>Bradshaw held out his hand. "Shake, Charlie. You're the first to hear
  about it. I'm going to be married. And oh, yes,&mdash;Julie is too."</p>

  <p>"Plenty good news," returned Chan heartily. "May you have half the
  happiness I wish you&mdash;the full amount would be impossible."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you, Mr. Chan," Julie said.</p>

  <p>"You're a great old scout," Bradshaw remarked. "I'll miss you. I'll miss
  this beach, too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is that? You leave Honolulu?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;sure."</p>

  <p>"You depart from this lovely spot, about which you have written one
  million words&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've got to, Charlie. Have you ever stopped to think about the effect of
  all this languid beauty on a young man's character? Devastating, that's what
  it is. On this crescent beach, fanned by the warm breath of the south, and so
  on&mdash;what happens to him? He droops, he stagnates, he crumbles. No more
  coco-palms for me. Redwoods, Charlie. Do you know about the redwoods? They
  brace you up. They're my trees hereafter. A big lumber and sap man from the
  West&mdash;that's going to be my role."</p>

  <p>Chan grinned. "You have failed to win Miss Julie to your views on
  Hawaii?"</p>

  <p>"It looks that way. Sold it to fifty thousand tourists, but not to the
  girl I love. That's life, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"When you go from here, you will leave much beauty behind," Charlie said.
  "But you will also take much beauty with you, since Miss Julie goes
  along."</p>

  <p>"Which remark, Mr. Bradshaw," Julie laughed, "should have come from
  you."</p>

  <p>"It would have, presently," he answered.</p>

  <p>Chan stood staring at the rising moon, the curve of lights along the
  whispering shore. The sad music of Hawaii came drifting up from the Moana
  courtyard. "To be young, in love, and on this beach," he said. "What greater
  happiness than that? Taste it to the full. It happens once, then time moves
  on. Moment comes when gold and pearls can not buy back the raven locks of
  youth."</p>

  <p>"Why, Charlie,&mdash;you're getting sentimental," Bradshaw cried.</p>

  <p>Chan nodded. "I think of my own courtship on this shore&mdash;so long ago.
  How long, you wonder? I am now father of eleven children&mdash;judge for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"You must be very proud of them," Julie ventured.</p>

  <p>"As proud as they will permit," Chan answered. "At least, I have done my
  part to link past with future. When I move on, leaving eleven offspring, can
  any man say I have not been here? I think not."</p>

  <p>"You're certainly right on that," Bradshaw assured him.</p>

  <p>"May I speak with you in private for a moment?" Charlie said. He walked
  with the boy back toward the lights of the house.</p>

  <p>"What's doing?" Bradshaw wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"Plenty will be doing at any moment now. Within the hour I tell you who
  killed Shelah Fane."</p>

  <p>"Good lord!" the boy gasped.</p>

  <p>"First, I suggest a task for you. Miss Julie was Shelah Fane's dear
  friend. Go back and break news gently to her that it was Miss Fane who shot
  Denny Mayo. Same is now established beyond all doubt."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean it?"</p>

  <p>"I do. Impart news gently, as I request. Then blow will not hit her with
  such cruel force as in crowd of people. It will be unhappy shock for her, but
  she will soon forget. She has your love."</p>

  <p>"All I've got, Charlie. Say&mdash;this is pretty considerate of you. But
  then&mdash;you think of everything."</p>

  <p>"Within my limitations, I try to do so. When news is broken, both of you
  are to come at once to living-room."</p>

  <p>"We'll do that, Charlie. Thanks."</p>

  <p>As Chan entered the great room, Diana Dixon was greeting Martino, Van Horn
  and Jaynes, who had come down from the hotel together. The detective noted
  with satisfaction that all three were in dinner clothes&mdash;was it too much
  to hope they wore the same shoes as on the previous evening?</p>

  <p>"Hello, Inspector," Martino said. "We came as soon as we could make it.
  What's in the air?"</p>

  <p>"A little experiment," Chan answered. "Perhaps our case is pau
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Jaynes was lighting a small cigar. "Pau&mdash;you mean finished? By jove,
  I hope so. They're holding a cabin for me on to-morrow's boat. I rely on you,
  Inspector."</p>

  <p>"We all do," added the director. "I want to get off myself.
  Huntley&mdash;you and I might take that boat too."</p>

  <p>Van Horn shrugged. "Oh&mdash;I don't care if I never leave. I was looking
  at that beach-comber last night. Shouldn't be surprised if he were the
  happiest man among us."</p>

  <p>"Going primitive, eh?" Martino smiled. "I suppose it's the influence of
  that part you played down in Tahiti."</p>

  <p>"It's the thought of Hollywood," responded Van Horn. "Of all the
  artificial places I've seen, that town wins the embossed medallion."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a true Californian," remarked Jimmy Bradshaw, entering with
  Julie. "Would you mind if I quoted you on that? Famous picture actor prefers
  Honolulu's simple ways to the fevered swank of the film colony."</p>

  <p>"You do," returned Van Horn grimly, "and I'll deny I ever said it."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" grinned Bradshaw. "All the movie actors' best lines have to be
  left out of their interviews."</p>

  <p>Wilkie Ballou and his wife came in. The former wore a linen suit, with
  white shoes, and Charlie was troubled. If Ballou took the chair that was
  waiting for some one in the dining-room, then his case might be far from
  proof even now.</p>

  <p>"What's it all about?" Ballou demanded. "I was going to bed early
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Poor old Wilkie can't stand excitement," Rita remarked. "As for me, I
  love it. Hello, Diana,&mdash;what have you been doing to-day?"</p>

  <p>The curtain parted, and Tarneverro stepped noiselessly into the room. He
  stood for a moment, staring about, a rather worried look in his dark
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," he said. "We're all here, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>Jaynes got slowly to his feet, walked over and proffered a case. "Good
  evening," he remarked. "Will you have one of my cigars?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," Tarneverro answered blandly. "I don't use them."</p>

  <p>"So sorry," replied the Britisher. "I rather thought you did."</p>

  <p>Charlie stepped hastily between them. "Will you be seated, please? We are
  all here, yes&mdash;except my Chief. We wait few minutes for him."</p>

  <p>They sat down. Rita, Diana and Julie chatted together in low tones. The
  men were silent, staring into space.</p>

  <p>Presently there was a clatter in the hall, and the Chief strode in. After
  him came Spencer, big and competent-looking. Chan leaped up.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Chief,&mdash;now we may go forward. I have explained that we desire
  to make small experiment. You know some of these people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wilkie Ballou shook the Chief's hand. "I'm glad to see you here," he
  remarked, with a glance toward Charlie.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tarneverro is also known to you," Chan continued, oblivious. He
  introduced the others. "Now we will all proceed to dining-room," he
  finished.</p>

  <p>"What! Another dinner party?" cried Rita Ballou.</p>

  <p>"A peculiar dinner party," Chan told her, "at which no food will be
  served. Come this way, please."</p>

  <p>They filed out, solemn and ill-at-ease now. The presence of the Chief and
  the burly policeman in uniform had served to impress them with the
  seriousness of the situation. Not unnaturally, they were asking themselves
  what all this meant? Was it a trap?</p>

  <p>Jessop was on duty in the dining-room, grave and dignified. He waited,
  ready to seat them at the barren table with the same poise as though it had
  gleamed with silver, been snowy with linen.</p>

  <p>"We are now about to make request," Chan said slowly. "I would remind you
  that this is important moment and you must think deep before acting. No
  mistake must be made. Will you kindly sit down at same places you occupied at
  this table last night?"</p>

  <p>A little chorus of dismay greeted his words. "But I was so excited, I
  don't remember," cried Diana, and the others echoed her. For a moment they
  milled about, puzzled and uncertain. Then Jimmy Bradshaw dropped down at the
  foot of the table, opposite the empty chair of the hostess.</p>

  <p>"I sat here," he announced. "I recall it perfectly. Julie, you were at my
  right. Mr. Van Horn, you sat at my left."</p>

  <p>Julie and the picture actor, with Jessop officiating, took their
  places.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ballou, you were here beside me," Julie said, and Chan heaved a sigh
  of relief as the Honolulu man sank into his chair.</p>

  <p>"So I was," Ballou remarked. "Thank you for remembering, my dear. Diana,
  you were at my right."</p>

  <p>"True enough," Miss Dixon agreed, and Jessop held her chair. "And, Val,
  you were at my right."</p>

  <p>"Of course," the director nodded, and sat down.</p>

  <p>One side of the table was now completely filled&mdash;but it was not the
  side that interested Charlie.</p>

  <p>"You were across from me, Rita," said Diana.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Ballou took her place.</p>

  <p>Two chairs, aside from the one at the head of the table, remained vacant,
  with Jaynes and Tarneverro left to occupy them.</p>

  <p>"I believe, Mrs. Ballou, that I had the honor of sitting beside you,"
  remarked Tarneverro, and took the chair at her right.</p>

  <p>"So you did," Rita agreed. "And Mr. Jaynes was on the other side." She
  indicated the chair at her left&mdash;the portentous chair before which were
  tiny scratches such as might have been made by a broken pin protruding
  slightly from the heel of a shoe.</p>

  <p>"I fancy we have it now," smiled Jaynes innocently and sat down.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. "You are seated just as you were last
  night?" Chan inquired slowly.</p>

  <p>"We are not," said Huntley Van Horn suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Something is wrong?" Charlie asked.</p>

  <p>"It is. Mr. Tarneverro is at my left now, but last night Mr. Jaynes was in
  that position."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," Rita Ballou cried. She turned to Tarneverro. "You and
  Mr. Jaynes have exchanged places."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we have," the fortune-teller answered amiably. He rose. Jaynes
  also got up, and took the chair at Rita's right. After a moment's hesitation,
  Tarneverro dropped into the fateful chair. "I fancy we're all set now," he
  remarked calmly. "Jessop, you may serve the soup."</p>

  <p>Charlie and the Chief exchanged a look, and moved away from the
  neighborhood of the table. They went into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Tarneverro," said the Chief softly. "I knew it. Take a look at his
  shoes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Chan stubbornly shook his head. "Something is very wrong here," he
  insisted.</p>

  <p>"Wrong, nonsense! What's got into you, anyhow, Charlie?"</p>

  <p>"Extremely wrong," Chan continued. "You can not convict a man with an
  alibi such as his. All broken pins in world would not avail."</p>

  <p>"Then the whole thing's a flop, according to you?"</p>

  <p>"So far&mdash;yes. But I do not despair. Permit me that I think a moment.
  There is some explanation of this. Ah, yes&mdash;come with me."</p>

  <p>They returned to the dining-room. The group about that barren table looked
  at them expectantly.</p>

  <p>"Kindly hold positions just as at present," Chan said. "I come back before
  I am missed."</p>

  <p>He stepped through a swinging door into the kitchen, and they heard his
  voice in low converse with Wu Kno-ching, the cook. They waited in silence;
  even the obviously innocent appeared anxious and uneasy. Presently Charlie
  returned, walking with unwonted briskness and with a grim look on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Jessop," he said.</p>

  <p>The butler stepped forward with a rather startled air.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Constable?"</p>

  <p>"Jessop, after these people departed last night, others sat at this
  table?"</p>

  <p>The butler had a guilty look. "I'm extremely sorry, sir. It was not quite
  in order&mdash;I would not ordinarily countenance it in a well-run house, but
  things were rather at sixes and sevens&mdash;and we had had no
  dinner&mdash;so we just sat down for a bit of coffee; we needed it
  badly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who sat down?"</p>

  <p>"Anna and I, sir."</p>

  <p>"You and Anna sat down at this table, after the guests had gone? Where did
  you sit?"</p>

  <p>"Over there&mdash;where Mr. Martino is now seated, sir."</p>

  <p>"And Anna&mdash;where did Anna sit?"</p>

  <p>"She sat here, sir." And Jessop laid his land on the back of Tarneverro's
  chair.</p>

  <p>For a moment Chan was silent, staring at the butler with unseeing eyes. He
  sighed heavily, as one who after a long journey sights the end of the trail
  at last.</p>

  <p>"Where is Anna now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She is in her room, I fancy, sir. Up-stairs."</p>

  <p>Charlie nodded at Spencer. "Bring this woman at once," he ordered, and the
  policeman disappeared. Chan turned to the table. "Our little experiment is
  ended. Please step back to living-room."</p>

  <p>They got up and filed silently across the hall. Charlie and the Chief
  waited at the foot of the stairway. The Chief said nothing, and Charlie also
  seemed disinclined to speak. Presently Spencer appeared at the head of the
  stairs, accompanied by Anna. They descended slowly. His eyes like black
  buttons in the half-light, Chan faced the woman. With cool unconcern, she
  returned his stare.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," he said. He led her into the living-room, and stood for a
  moment looking at her feet. She wore high, black shoes, in keeping with her
  sober uniform. The right one, Charlie noted, seemed somewhat thick about the
  ankle.</p>

  <p>"Anna, I must make very odd request of you," he said. "Will you be good
  enough to remove right shoe?"</p>

  <p>She sat down, and began slowly to unlace it. Tarneverro came forward and
  stood at Chan's side. The detective ignored him.</p>

  <p>He took the heavy shoe from Anna's hand, turned it over, and with his
  penknife slit the rubber heel. A little half-inch length of gold pin lay
  exposed, and with a gesture of triumph he lifted it out and held it up.</p>

  <p>"You are all witnesses," he reminded them. He turned to Anna. "As for you,
  I fear you have been grossly careless. When you stamped those orchids under
  foot, you failed to note this telltale evidence of your act. Ah,
  well&mdash;but for such brief moments of neglect, we would get nowhere in
  this business." He gave his attention to the shoe. "I note braces built along
  the sides," he continued. "Meant to protect weak ankle, I think. You have had
  an accident, madam?"</p>

  <p>"My&mdash;my ankle was broken&mdash;long ago," she replied, in a voice
  barely audible.</p>

  <p>"Broken?" cried Charlie quickly. "When? How? Was it dancing on the stage
  you broke that ankle? Ah, yes&mdash;it was. Madam&mdash;I think you were once
  the wife of Denny Mayo."</p>

  <p>The woman took a little step toward him. Her eyes were hard and defiant,
  but her usually dark face was white as Waikiki's sands.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; THE VEIL IS LIFTED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Charlie turned to Tarneverro. In the deep-set eyes of the
  fortune-teller he saw a reluctant admiration. He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have been plenty dense," he said. "This woman is on the scene by no
  coincidence. When you set up as lifter of the veil in Hollywood, you
  needed&mdash;what? Spies&mdash;spies to scatter about the place, and bring
  you morsels of gossip regarding film people. Your brother's wife had suffered
  accident, she was no longer able to work at profession, she was penniless and
  alone. You sent for her. What more natural than that action? You helped her
  to position, that she might help you."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro shrugged. "You have a remarkable imagination, Mr. Chan."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;you flatter me," Charlie cried. "It has just been proved I
  have not imagination enough. Only one claim I make for myself&mdash;when
  light at last begins to stream in, I do not close the shutters. Light is
  streaming in now. Anna's task was not alone to bring you trivial
  information&mdash;she was also to assist you in solving matter of Denny
  Mayo's murder. Was that why you placed her with Shelah Fane? Had you already
  some suspicion of Miss Fane? I think so. Yesterday morning in your apartment,
  actress confessed her misdeed to you. At once you inform Anna that victory
  has come. You are in high spirits. Your own intention is honest one, you plan
  to hand Miss Fane to police. Otherwise you would not say to me what you did
  in Grand Hotel lounge last night. Then&mdash;what happened?"</p>

  <p>"You tell me, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"Such is my purpose. You learn that Shelah Fane is murdered. Without being
  told, you know who did the deed. The position is hard one for you, but mind
  works fast as usual. You invent false story about your seance with Shelah
  Fane, and boost me off on wrong trail at once. You talk about mythical letter
  Miss Fane was to write for you. Then, to your surprise and dismay, you find
  real letter was written. It may wreck plans at once, so you strike me down
  and obtain epistle. Needless act, as it turns out. You rage about, destroying
  photographs of Mayo to conceal relationship with him. You seek to befuddle me
  by involving innocent parties. Oh, you have been busy man, Mr. Tarneverro. I
  might forgive you, but I find it difficult to forgive myself. Why have I been
  so stupid?"</p>

  <p>"Who says you've been stupid, Charlie?" the Chief asked.</p>

  <p>"I do, and I remark same with bitter force," Chan answered. "My little
  duel with this fortune-teller should have been finished long hours ago.
  Matter was clear enough. I knew he employed spies. I gathered&mdash;though I
  paid not enough attention to fact&mdash;that some one had been spying on Miss
  Fane in Tahiti and on returning boat. I learned that Anna here bought
  bonds&mdash;matter which might indicate more income than simple wage as maid.
  I listen to Tarneverro's alibi and feel certain he did not do murder himself.
  What, then, explains his actions? Natural inference for good detective would
  have been that he protects some one else. Who? I read in newspaper that Denny
  Mayo had wife. I discover Mayo was Tarneverro's brother, and I hear that Mayo
  was slain by hand of Shelah Fane. Later&mdash;crowning touch&mdash;I am told
  Mayo's wife encountered accident and can no longer follow profession. Do I
  put two and two together? Do I add up simple sum and get result? No&mdash;I
  fumble around&mdash;I flounder like decrepit fish&mdash;finally I slide into
  happy harbor of success." He turned suddenly on Anna, standing pale and
  silent before him. "For I am in that harbor. It is true, is it not, madam?
  You killed Shelah Fane!"</p>

  <p>"I did," the woman answered.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Anna," Tarneverro cried. "Fight it out."</p>

  <p>She gestured hopelessly. "What's the use? I don't care. I've nothing to
  live for&mdash;it doesn't matter what becomes of me. Yes, I killed her. Why
  not? She&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," the Chief broke in. "Anything you say, you know, may be
  used against you."</p>

  <p>"You're a little late with that, Chief," Tarneverro said. "She should have
  a lawyer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't want one," Anna went on sullenly. "I don't want any help. I
  killed her&mdash;she robbed me of my husband&mdash;she wasn't content to take
  his love&mdash;she ended by taking his life. I've had my revenge, and I'm
  willing to pay for it. I intend to plead guilty, and get it over with at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Fine," approved the Chief. He saw the territory saved the expense of a
  long trial.</p>

  <p>"You're mad, Anna," cried the fortune-teller.</p>

  <p>She shrugged. "Don't mind me. I wrecked all your plans, I fancy. I spoiled
  everything for you. Forget me and go your way alone."</p>

  <p>Her tone was bitter and cold, and Tarneverro, rebuffed, turned away from
  her. Charlie offered her a chair. "Sit down, madam. I desire to make brief
  interrogation. It is true that Tarneverro brought you to Hollywood?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." She accepted the chair. "I'll take it from the beginning, if you
  like. While Denny was acting in the pictures, I continued to dance in London
  music-halls. I was doing well, when I had that accident&mdash;I broke my
  ankle&mdash;I couldn't dance any more. I wrote to Denny about it, and asked
  if I could come to him. I didn't receive any answer&mdash;and then I heard he
  had been killed.</p>

  <p>"Arthur&mdash;Denny's brother here&mdash;was also playing in London at
  that time. He was kind to me&mdash;loaned me money&mdash;and then he told me
  he was going out to the States to learn who had killed poor Denny, if he
  could. After a time he wrote that he had set up in Hollywood as a
  fortune-teller, calling himself Tarneverro. He said he
  needed&mdash;help&mdash;that he could use me if I was willing to go into
  service. I had taken a position as wardrobe mistress with a manager for whom
  I used to dance. It was hard work&mdash;and the memories&mdash;I longed to
  get away from it all."</p>

  <p>"So you went to Hollywood," prompted the Chief.</p>

  <p>"I did, and I met Tarneverro secretly. He said he would place me with Miss
  Fane. He advised her to get rid of the maid she had, and sent me round the
  same day to apply for the position. He had discovered that Miss Fane and
  Denny were once&mdash;very close friends&mdash;and he thought I might be able
  to get on the trail of something in her house. He suggested that I change my
  appearance as much as possible&mdash;my way of doing my hair&mdash;he feared
  that Denny might have shown her pictures of me. I followed his instructions,
  but it was an unnecessary precaution. Denny&mdash;he must have lost my
  pictures&mdash;lost them or thrown them away. Miss Fane engaged me, and I was
  successful in the post. You see&mdash;I'd had maids myself. For a year and a
  half I was with her&mdash;helping Tarneverro. But I could discover nothing.
  Nothing about Denny, I mean.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday afternoon Tarneverro and I met on the beach. He told me Shelah
  Fane had confessed to killing Denny&mdash;confessed it in his apartment that
  morning. He wanted to get a repetition of that confession with a witness to
  overhear&mdash;he planned it for last night in the pavilion. He would talk
  with her there alone, and I was to be hiding somewhere about. Then he
  proposed to send for an officer.</p>

  <p>"I returned to this house, almost beside myself with hatred for the woman
  who had wrecked Denny's life&mdash;and mine. I got to thinking&mdash;sitting
  alone in my room. Tarneverro's plan began to look so very foolish to me. The
  police? I knew what one of your American juries would do with a woman like
  Shelah Fane&mdash;a beautiful, famous woman. They would never convict
  her&mdash;never. There were better ways than the police. I&mdash;I kept on
  thinking. I'm rather sorry I did."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed. "No&mdash;I'm not. I'm glad. I planned it all out. Last
  night&mdash;during the party&mdash;that was the time. Plenty of people
  about&mdash;plenty of people who might have done it. I planned the alibi of
  the watch&mdash;I remembered it from a play in which Denny once acted. I was
  in the kitchen from twenty minutes before eight until ten after the hour.
  Jessop and the cook were there too. At eight-fifteen I located Shelah Fane in
  the pavilion&mdash;she was waiting there&mdash;waiting to make a good
  entrance on her party&mdash;as she always did. She was like that.</p>

  <p>"I went to her room and got a knife&mdash;one she had bought in Tahiti. I
  wanted something to wrap it in&mdash;a handkerchief&mdash;a big one. The door
  of the blue room was open&mdash;I saw a man's clothes. I went in and took the
  handkerchief from the pocket of the coat&mdash;Mr. Bradshaw's coat, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," remarked Jimmy Bradshaw grimly. "Thanks for the ad."</p>

  <p>"I went to the pavilion," Anna continued. "She didn't suspect. I came
  close to her&mdash;" The woman buried her face in her hands. "You won't make
  me tell that part. Afterward I broke the watch in the handkerchief, put it
  back on her wrist. But there was no other evidence of a struggle, so I tore
  off the orchids and trampled them under foot. I went out and buried the knife
  deep in the sand&mdash;I heard voices on the beach&mdash;I was frightened. I
  ran to the house, and went up to my room by way of the back stairs."</p>

  <p>"And the handkerchief?" Charlie inquired. "You gave that to Mr. Tarneverro
  when he arrived?"</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," said the fortune-teller. "Anna&mdash;when did you and I
  last talk together alone?"</p>

  <p>"On the beach, yesterday afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Have we communicated with each other since that moment?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No."</p>

  <p>"Have I heard you say before that you killed Shelah Fane?"</p>

  <p>"No, you have not."</p>

  <p>The fortune-teller looked at the Chief. "A little matter," he remarked,
  "that I am rather keen to bring out."</p>

  <p>"But the handkerchief?" The Chief turned to Anna.</p>

  <p>"I dropped it on the lawn. I&mdash;I wanted it to be found there." She
  glanced at Bradshaw. "It wasn't mine, you know."</p>

  <p>"Very thoughtful of you," bowed the boy.</p>

  <p>"On the lawn, precisely," said Tarneverro, "where I picked it up."</p>

  <p>"And put it in my pocket," remarked Martino. "By the way, I haven't
  thanked you for that."</p>

  <p>"Do not trouble," Chan advised him. "You were not the only one Mr.
  Tarneverro honored with his attentions."</p>

  <p>The Chief went over to the woman's side. "Go upstairs," he said sternly.
  "And get ready. You'll have to go down-town with us. You can tell that story
  again&mdash;at the station." He nodded to Spencer to accompany her.</p>

  <p>The woman rose, her manner sullen and defiant, and went from the room,
  with the policeman at her side.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Ballou, "I guess we can all go now."</p>

  <p>The Chief gave a sign of acquiescence. Wilkie and Rita left first,
  followed by Martino, Van Horn and Jaynes. The latter stopped to shake
  Charlie's hand.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he remarked in a low voice. "I shall make my boat. And on this
  boat&mdash;and all others in the future&mdash;I shall try to keep my
  head."</p>

  <p>Diana went quietly up to her room. Chan turned to Julie.</p>

  <p>"Go back to beach," he said gently. "Look up at stars, breathe clean fresh
  air and think of future happiness."</p>

  <p>The girl gazed at him, wide-eyed. "Poor Shelah," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Shelah Fane's troubles over now," Chan reminded her. "Do poor lady great
  kindness, and forget. Jimmy here will help you."</p>

  <p>Bradshaw nodded. "I certainly will." He put his arm about the girl. "Come
  on, Julie. One more look at the coco-palms, and then we're off for the coast,
  where trees are trees." They moved toward the French window. Bradshaw smiled
  at Chan over his shoulder. "So long, Charlie. I've got to go now and tone
  down my adjectives so they'll fit California."</p>

  <p>They went out, and Chan turned back into the room to find his Chief
  staring speculatively at Tarneverro. "Well, Charlie," he remarked. "What are
  we going to do with our friend here?"</p>

  <p>Chan did not answer, but thoughtfully rubbed his cheek. Tarneverro, seeing
  the gesture, smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry," he said. "I've made you a lot of trouble, Inspector. But I
  was in a horrible position&mdash;you can realize that. Should I have handed
  Anna over to you at once? Perhaps, but as I told you last night, I saw
  immediately that I was responsible for the whole affair. Innocently so, of
  course, but none the less responsible. I ought never to have told
  her&mdash;but I wanted a witness. If only I had kept my discovery to
  myself."</p>

  <p>"The man who looks back sees his mistakes piled up behind," Chan
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"But I never dreamed Anna would lose her head like that. These women,
  Inspector."</p>

  <p>"They are primitive creatures, these women."</p>

  <p>"So it would seem. Anna has always been a strange, silent, unfriendly
  person. But there was one bond between us&mdash;we both loved Denny. When she
  proved last night how desperately she loved him&mdash;well, I couldn't betray
  her. Instead I fought my duel with you. Fought to the limit of my
  ability&mdash;and lost." He held out his hand.</p>

  <p>Chan took it. "Only the churlish are mean-spirited in victory," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>The policeman in uniform looked through the curtains.</p>

  <p>"Right with you, Spencer," said the Chief. "Mr. Tarneverro, you'd better
  come along. I'll talk to the Prosecutor about you. But you needn't be
  alarmed. We're not inclined to spend much money over here on chance visitors
  from the mainland."</p>

  <p>Tarneverro bowed. "You're very encouraging."</p>

  <p>"You got your car, Charlie?" the Chief asked.</p>

  <p>"I have it," Chan told him.</p>

  <p>The Chief and Tarneverro went into the hall, and presently Charlie heard
  the front door slam.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment looking about him at the bright room where his work
  was pau at last. Then, sighing ponderously, he stepped through the curtains
  and picked up his hat from a table in the hallway. Wu Kno-ching appeared
  suddenly from the dining-room.</p>

  <p>Charlie gazed into the beady eyes, the withered yellow face of his
  compatriot.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something, Wu," he said. "How was it I came upon this road? Why
  should one of our race concern himself with the hatreds and the misdeeds of
  the haoles?"</p>

  <p>"Wha's mallah you?" Wu inquired.</p>

  <p>"I am weary," sighed Chan. "I want peace now. A very trying case, good Wu
  Kno-ching. But"&mdash;he nodded, and a smile spread over his fat
  face&mdash;"as you know, my friend, a gem is not polished without rubbing nor
  a man perfected without trials."</p>

  <p>The door closed gently behind him.</p>
