<h2><a name="sermon1"></a>SERMON I</h2>

<blockquote>"What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days that
he may see good? Keep thy tongue<br>
from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile; depart from evil and do
good; seek peace and pursue it."<br>
Psalm xxxiv: 12-14.</blockquote>

<p>Self-preservation and the desire of protracting the momentary span of
life is the first principle of our nature, or is at least so intimately
interwoven with our constitution as to appear inherent. So powerful is
this desire, that in defiance of pain and misery, it seldom quits us to
the last moments of our existence. To endeavor to lengthen out our lives
is not only desirable, but is a duty enjoined upon us in the scriptures,
and is most beautifully and forcibly expressed in our text.</p>

<p>We might here introduce many observations of a philosophical character
on <i>air</i> and <i>climate, meat</i> and <i>drink, motion</i> and
<i>rest, sleeping</i> and <i>watching, etc.</i> and show how sensibly
they contribute to health; and we might furnish many examples of long
life, but we pass these, and proceed to notice the affections of the mind
upon which our text is grounded.</p>

<p>The due regulation of the passions contributes more to health and
longevity than climate, or even the observance of any course of diet. Our
Creator has so constituted our natures, that <i>duty, health,
happiness</i> and <i>longevity</i> are inseparably blended in the same
cup. To suppress, and finally subdue all the passions of malice, anger,
envy, jealousy, hatred and revenge, and to exercise (till they become
familiar) all the noble passions of tenderness, compassion, love, hope
and joy, is a duty that heaven solemnly enjoins upon us, and in the
performance of which our years will be multiplied. But we must guard not
only our moral natures from the ravages of the corroding and revengeful
passions, but also our physical natures by observing the strictest rules
of temperance in <i>eating, drinking, cleanliness</i> and
<i>exercise.</i></p>

<p>The book of God commands us to "be temperate in all things." The
observance of this duty gives us a firm constitution, robust health, and
prepares us to participate in all the innocent and rational enjoyments of
life. Here we may witness the goodness of the Divine Being in uniting our
duty, happiness and interest in one; and so firmly are they wedded
together, and so absolutely does each depend upon the other that they
cannot exist alone. They are alike laid in ruins the moment they are
separated. If we trace this idea still further, we witness the same wise
arrangement, and the same incomprehensible skill and goodness of the
Author of our being in the constitution of our mental natures. In these
also he has wholly united our duty, happiness and longevity in one. Jesus
says, "Love your enemies; bless them that curse you, do good to them that
hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you,
that ye may be the children of your Father in heaven." Paul says&mdash;"
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be
put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender
hearted, forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath
forgiven you."</p>

<p>Here then is our duty plainly pointed out. If we will exercise this
spirit of benignity to our enemies, subdue all our revengeful passions,
and indulge a spirit of love and friendship, of meekness and cheerfulness
towards our friends and neighbors, we shall not only be happy as our
natures can bear, not only revel in all the rational enjoyments this life
can impart, but we shall in the common course of providence live to old
age. All those, with very few exceptions, who have lived to 80, 90, and
100 years, have been remarked for their equanimity. They were mild
spirited, kind, cheerful, and of such a temperament, that neither
misfortune, nor any outward circumstances, that agitated the world, could
disturb their heaven-born repose.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the path of duty, enjoined in the sacred scriptures,
is not only the path of peace and joy, but conducts to a good old age.
The goodness of the Divine Being is most strikingly exemplified in
uniting health and temperance, happiness and longevity, and our duty to
our fellow creatures, all in one.</p>

<p>Long life and good days, however, depend more upon the state of our
minds than upon almost any other circumstance. He who lives in fear and
trouble arising from any cause whatever; whether from contemplation of
endless misery in the future world, or from the apprehension that his
earthly prospects will he blasted and his fortune laid in ruins&mdash;or
if he is continually involved in quarrels, broils and tumults with his
neighbors, has but little prospect of living to old age, and certainly no
hope of seeing good days. He is in a constant hell. Here then we see the
beauty and propriety of our text: "What man is he that desireth life and
loveth many days that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil and thy
lips from speaking guile; depart from evil and do good; seek peace and
pursue it."</p>

<p>The first <i>condition</i> for a long life is, "keep thy tongue from
evil and thy lips from speaking guile." But the question arises, in what
sense can the violation of that <i>condition</i> have any effect upon the
length of life? The answer is at hand&mdash;the slanderer is ever a busy
body in other men&rsquo;s matters. He is secretly endeavoring to injure
his neighbors. He circulates falsehoods about them from house to house.
One and another hears the reports put into circulation. They call upon
the author for an explanation of his conduct. Involved in trouble,
arising from fear, guilt and mortification, he tells a thousand
falsehoods to clear up one. All this preys upon his inmost vitals, while
perhaps with another, whom he has slandered, he is involved in a quarrel,
and it terminates in a settled hatred; and a third case becomes an
incurable distemper of rancour and revenge. Here is a man who by slander
has rendered his existence wretched. He is like the troubled ocean whose
waters find no rest.</p>

<p>There is but little hope of his reaching the common age of man.
Instead of seeing good days he is walking in the regions of night and wo.
Says the wise man, "where there is no fuel the fire goeth out, so where
there is no tattler, strife ceaseth." Yes, "where there is envying and
strife, there is confusion and every evil work."</p>

<p>Violent anger excites powerfully the caloric in the human system,
boils the blood, and in this state throws it suddenly upon the brain. The
powerful shock propels it instantly to the exterior surface, and
torrent-like contracts it back again in redoubled fury upon the brain,
and leaves the countenance pale and ghastly. It deranges in a great
measure the mind, and unfits it for useful action. It darts its electric
fire of vengeance along the optic nerve, expands the retina, and gives to
every object a magnified and false appearance, while the very eye-balls
by a wild and savage glare proclaim the dreadful storm that is raging
within, and pouring the poisonous streams of premature death through all
the healthful channels of existence! It suddenly braces the nervous
system, and then on the opposite extreme leaves it depressed and
weakened. It gradually brings on rheumatic complaints, and lays the whole
system open to the most formidable and painful disorders that afflict the
human race. It cannot have escaped medical observation that fevers and
consumptions are much more frequent among persons who are very irritable
and exercise little or no rule over their passions, than among those who
are of a mild temperament, either naturally, or from early restraint and
education.</p>

<p>There is a connexion between the mind and the body so subtle that it
has hitherto eluded the eagle-eye of Physiology, and will perhaps remain
inscrutible forever to human comprehension. But that this connexion
exists is fully demonstrated by medical experience, and observation. Many
bodily disorders derange the mind, and have in many instances totally
destroyed it. So on the other hand diseases of the mind effect the body
in return, and <i>grief, despair</i> and <i>melancholy</i> have so preyed
upon the vitals as to emaciate the body, and bring it to the grave. It is
not uncommon that consumptions are brought on by <i>trouble</i> of mind,
by <i>guilt,</i> and by <i>melancholy</i> and <i>grief.</i> And many
instances have occurred, where persons in excessive violent anger have
dropped down dead. What is so dreadful, when carried to extreme, must be
very injurious to health, and long life, when indulged frequently and
even moderately.</p>

<p>There being then such an intimate connexion between the mind and body,
and so many thousands of ways in which one alternately acts upon, and
effects the other, and brings millions to an untimely grave, we see at
once the propriety of not only guarding our health by temperance in
eating and drinking, but more particularly by avoiding troubles of a
mental character. These are generally brought upon individuals, families
and neighborhoods, by the bad use of the tongue. Would you live long that
you may see good days? Then keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from
speaking guile, seek peace and pursue it. Avoid every species of iniquity
that would have a tendency to blast your own or the peace of others.
Avoid it as you would the poisonous exhalations of the Bohon Upas, and
fly it as you would the dreadful Samiel of the Arabian desert.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon2"></a>SERMON II</h2>

<blockquote>"What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days that
he may see good? Keep thy tongue<br>
from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile; depart from evil and do
good; seek peace and pursue it."<br>
Psalm xxxiv: 12-14.</blockquote>

<p>We have shown in our last number that the truth of this text is based
upon philosophy, and verified by experience and observation: that nothing
is more destructive to health and longevity than to indulge in the
revengeful passions of our nature; and that constant fear, grief and
melancholy are also destructive to the human constitution, and withering
to the dearest joys of life. We have shown that violent anger, revenge
and most of the malignant passions originate from the bad use of the
tongue; and that if we would live long and see good, we must give heed to
our ways by following the injunctions of the text. We now propose a
further discussion of this subject, addressed particularly to the
young.</p>

<p>A single spark of fire has often wrapped a city in conflagration.
Great effects not unfrequently flow from small causes. The apostle James
says, see chap. iii&mdash;"Behold also the ships, which though they be so
great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet they are turned about with a
very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is
a little member and boasteth great things. Behold how great a matter a
little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity; so
is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and
setteth on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell. For
every kind of beasts and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the
sea is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind. But the tongue can no man
tame; it is an unruly member full of deadly poison." The apostle, in the
above quotation, has reference to those who have so long indulged in evil
speaking that it has become, as it were, an incurable habit. If any man
makes a practice of slandering his neighbors, and disturbing the peace of
the community, it is immaterial to what church he may belong, or what os-
tentatious professions he may make, he is, notwithstanding all this,
destitute of christianity.</p>

<p>It is a painful fact that the religion of the present day is too much
accommodated to the fashions and customs of the world. Let a man, for
instance, use profane language, or get intoxicated, and he will readily
be suspended from the communion of the church. But let him slander his
neighbors, and little or no notice is taken of his conduct. And let him
slander other denominations; and it becomes, as it were, a virtue;
whereas the fact is that the latter, according to the book of God, is
much the greatest crime. It is therefore wise to lay, in early youth, a
foundation for a tranquil, virtuous and long life.</p>

<p>Thus you see my young friends that virtue and happiness, temperance,
prosperity and longevity are inseparably connected by the Author of our
being, who has made them to depend in a great measure upon our conduct.
You have also seen that sin and misery, intemperance in body, and also
intemperance in mind, such as evil speaking, violent anger, commotions,
griefs and troubles, and a premature grave, are likewise inseparably and
wisely connected.</p>

<p>And now, my young friends, which will you choose? If you love life and
desire to see many days, let me exhort you to choose the <i>former</i>,
and to drink freely out of that golden cup in which every earthly joy of
unbroken felicity is mingled by the unerring hand of divine mercy; and
let me warn you to reject the <i>latter</i>, for in it are mingled the
bitter drugs of misery. Be temperate in eating and drinking. Be temperate
in all your pursuits in life, and in all your desires. Be temperate in
your conduct; and (as an able writer observes) pitch upon that course of
life which is the most excellent, and habit will soon render it the most
delightful. Avoid not only every word and action that may lead to discord
and contention, but, as our text says, depart from evil and <i>do
good</i>, seek peace, and pursue it. Let us do good to all our fellow
creatures, and endeavor to overcome their hatred with love, and their
evil with good.</p>

<p>Yes, my young friends, affectionately and solemnly would I urge you to
begin early to curb your passions, and to study sweetness of disposition.
It will soon become to you perfectly natural, and thus you will lay the
foundation for a virtuous and tranquil old age. But, asks the youth,
shall I live longer for subduing my passions and doing good, for seeking
peace and pursuing it? Certainly. Our text teaches this; so does
philosophy, and the scriptures generally. Jesus Christ says, "Blessed are
the <i>meek</i>, for they shall inherit the earth." That is, they shall
long enjoy it. "Blessed are the peace-makers for they shall be called the
children of God." The fifth Commandment says, "Honor thy father and thy
mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God
giveth thee." By honoring our parents, we are to understand a filial and
submissive obedience to their precepts by not departing from that way in
which with many exhortations, prayers and tears, they sought to train us
up. In this case, honoring them would of course require us to walk in the
paths of virtue and temperance, and to live an honest, quiet and
peaceable life which would ensure the promise, and give us many days.</p>

<p>Not only do the scriptures promise long life to the peaceable,
temperate and meek, but they on the other hand just as solemnly declare
that "the wicked shall not live out half their days." This passage has
occasioned much dispute among religious denominations; one affirming that
every man's time is appointed in the counsels of heaven by the decree of
God, who "declares the end from the beginning;" and another affirming
that <i>it is not</i>, for the above passage teaches that the life of man
may be shortened. But there is no occasion for dispute on this point, for
they are both right, as we have seen in the course of our remarks. This
passage is but the counterpart of our text. It is the decree of God that
the wicked, the abandoned shall not reach the extreme of human life,
because they indulge in those very crimes, which, in the constitution of
things, must inevitably carry them to an early tomb. Of the truth of this
we see thousands of instances in the world. And God has decreed that the
meek, the peaceable shall reach the extreme of life, because they pitch
upon that happy course of conduct which naturally leads to it. All that
we are to understand by his <i>decree</i>, is that he has inseparably
connected the <i>end</i> with the <i>means</i> by so constituting our
natures, and so ordering his providence that <i>sin, dissipation,
anger,</i> and <i>revenge</i> shall not only destroy happiness, but
shorten life, so certain as men pursue such a wretched course. And that
the opposite course of conduct shall not only communicate happiness, but
protract life so certain as they engage in it.</p>

<p>Here then, my young friends, you may readily perceive how God punishes
vice and rewards virtue. He does not do it by any abstract law, or
arbitrary mode of procedure, but lie has in infinite wisdom interwoven,
the whole in the very constitution of our natures, so that the wicked
cannot go unpunished, nor the righteous unrewarded. To teach that man can
indulge in vice, and yet escape its punishment by future repentance, is
not only dangerous to the morals of society, but is a direct impeachment
of the divine administration, as it must in such case, be defective. And
to teach that men may live righteously and godly and yet go unrewarded,
is equally dangerous to the morals of the community, as it is but
discouraging them from engaging in a virtuous course of conduct. To teach
that men are to be rewarded in a future world for their <i>goodness</i>
here, is but in substance saying that virtue is attended with mental
misery, and so far as it fails of rewarding its possessor <i>here,</i>
the balance is to be made up <i>hereafter.</i> And to teach that men are
to be punished in a future state for their <i>badness</i> here, is but in
substance saying, that vice is attended with some mental joys, and so far
as it fails of punishing its possessor <i>here,</i> the balance is to be
made up <i>hereafter.</i></p>

<p>It is readily granted that the righteous may suffer. But we ought ever
to make a plain distinction between afflictions and punishments, for the
Bible does this. It is impossible in the nature of things that punishment
can exist except in connexion with guilt. Paul and Silas were cast into
prison and fastened in the stocks, on account of their religion. But
nothing could disturb their mental peace&mdash;their heaven-born repose.
They joyfully sung psalms, and lifted up their voices in prayer to God in
the calm enjoyment of a pure unsullied conscience. They suffered
afflictions that were, under the government of God, to work out for their
good. There were no doubt others in that prison justly suffering for
their crimes. To them it was punishment. Because the <i>former</i> were
suffering <i>affliction,</i> the <i>latter, punishment.</i> The
scriptures say, "Great peace have they that love thy law; and nothing
shall offend them." "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked;" and
he who says there <i>is,</i> contradicts Jehovah.</p>

<p>If you would, my young friends, avoid punishment, avoid sin. If you
would be happy, and enjoy a long and tranquil life, follow carefully the
directions of our text; for rest assured that a contrary course of
conduct will not only involve you in misery and wretchedness, but bring
you to a premature grave. Let us then take warning, and not become our
own executioners. Let us make the most of life we may, and not turn our
present existence, which is one of heaven's choicest blessings, into a
curse. Let us do good in our day and generation, and render ourselves
blessings to mankind, by living soberly, righteously and peaceably in the
world? Let us do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God&mdash;visit
the widow and the fatherless in their affliction, and keep ourselves
unspotted from the world.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon3"></a>SERMON III</h2>

<blockquote>"And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall
be with the<br>
beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen,
and<br>
seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the Most High<br>
ruleth in the kingdom of, men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will."<br>
Daniel iv: 32.</blockquote>

<p>That reason, as well as revelation, teaches an overruling providence,
very few deny. There must exist in nature an omnipotent and benevolent
Being to keep all her works in harmony&mdash;to touch the most secret and
subtle springs of the vast machinery of the universe&mdash;to regulate
seed time and harvest, summer and winter, day and night; and to throw the
enrapturing charms of countless variety not only over the landscape, but
over all that we behold in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath.
Globes roll in the paths assigned them, and by some unseen hand are
wisely kept from interfering in their orbits, and disturbing each other's
motions. These facts demonstrate the existence of an omniscient,
omnipotent, and Benevolent Being; and every event, transpiring in the
government of the world, proclaims an omnipresent Jehovah.</p>

<p>He not only works in the majesty of the lightning, and in the grandeur
of the storm regulating and directing the whole in its sublime career,
but he notices the fall of a sparrow, and numbers thevery hairs of our
head. Events, the most trivial in their nature, are the objects of his
notice, as well as those of the most momentous character. Were not this
the case, universal disorder and ruinwould soon find their way into his
works, break the chain of events, and reduce all, that we now admire,
from its present harmony and glory, down to its general confusion and
chaos. This conclusion is unavoidable, because some of the greatest
events that have transpired in the world, owe their existence to
something of a very trivial nature.</p>

<p>If God did not, in the general government of the world, direct also
<i>small events,</i> then he could not be the author of those great
events which flow from them. On this principle there might transpire
countless events of the greatest magnitude without the direction and
superintendance of Deity. The admission of <i>this</i> is but practical
Atheism. It is acknowledging a God in words, but in works denying him. It
alike makes <i>chance</i> the governor of the world to those who
acknowledge such a God, as to those who wholly deny his existence.</p>

<p>In our text a presiding Deity is solemnly recognized by the prophet
Daniel, and his supremacy over the affairs of men is throughout the whole
chapter most strikingly set forth before the Assyrian king. He had
dreamed a dream which none of the wise men of Babylon were able to
interpret. Daniel was called to him; who after making known to that proud
monarch his destiny involved in that dream,expostulates with him on his
conduct. He did not threaten him with endless punishment in tile immortal
world, but informed him that there was a God that ruled the heavens, and
presided over the affairs of men; and exhorted him to forsake his
iniquities. This is his language: "And whereas they commanded to leave
the stump of the tree roots, thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after
thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. Wherefore, 0 king! let my
counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness,
and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, if it may be a
lengthening of thy tranquillity. All this came upon the king
Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months, he walked in the palace of
the kingdom of Babylon. The king spake, and said, "Is not this great
Babylon, that I have built for the house of my kingdom, by the might of
my power and for the honor of my majesty? While the word was in the
king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king
Nebuchadnezzar! to thee it is spoken; the kingdom is departed from thee.
And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the
beasts of the field; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven
times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in
the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will."</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar was the Son of Nabopolasser, and the second king of
Assyria. He was Regent with his father in the Empire 607 years before the
birth of our Lord, and the next year, he raised a powerful army, marched
against Jerusalem, and took Jehoiakim, king of Judah, prisoner. While
making preparations to carry him and his subjects into captivity, in
Babylon, Jehoiakim solemnly promised submission, and begged the privilege
of holding his throne under the sceptre of Nebuchadnezzar. This favor was
granted, and he was permitted to remain at Jerusalem. Three years after
this, he made an unsuccessful attempt to throw off the Assyrian yoke and
regain his former independence. This brought on the general captivity of
the Jewish nation, which lasted 70 years.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar extended his conquests till he subjugated the
Ethiopians, Arabians, Idumeans, Philistines, Syrians, Persians, Medes,
Assyrians, and nearly all Asia to his sceptre. These splendid conquests,
and being now king of kings, lifted up his heart with pride, that he
caused a golden image to be reared on the plains of Dura. He issued a
royal edict, and commanded the princes and rulers of all these nations as
well as their principal subjects to assemble; and being assembled, he
commanded them to fall down and worship his golden god. Daniel's
companions refused to do this, and were cast into the fiery furnace.</p>

<p>From this circumstance he was brought to acknowledge a Supreme Being,
and even issued a decree that any one who spoke amiss against the God of
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego should be cut in pieces. But as he was
gazing upon the massy walls of Babylon&mdash;a work of gigantic
achievement; as he was surveying, from the height of his palace, the
hanging gardens and lofty towers, (an aerial world!) as he was admiring
his own magnificence, by the sentence of that God whom he had glorified,
he was driven from men, and in the Hebrew style of expression, is said to
have eaten grass like oxen. By this we are to understand that he was
suddenly seized with a disease called by the Greeks lyconthropy, and
which is known among physicians at the present day by the name of
hypochondria. It is a species of madness that causes persons to run into
the fields and streets in the night, and sometimes to suppose themselves
to have the heads of oxen, horses, dogs, or fancy themselves to be like
some other animal, and doomed to fare like them. And some have imagined
themselves to be made of glass. At the end of seven years
Nebuchadnezzar's understanding returned to him, and he was restored to
his throne and glory. He died 562 years before Christ in the 43rd year of
his reign.</p>

<p>It is our intention to consider this text in a moral point of view, as
applicable to all men of all ages, and in all conditions in life. While
pursuing the various occupations to which our inclination, or fancy may
lead, we are too apt to lose sight of that Being who holds our destinies
in his hand; and more particularly so in seasons of prosperity, when
blest with health and other sublunary enjoyments. Strange as it may seem,
yet it is substantially true, that in proportion as man is successful in
the accomplishment of his plans, he becomes arrogant and haughty in his
feelings, and instead of acknowledging his dependence on God, and feeling
the bursts of gratitude for the favors and enjoyments heaven scatters in
his path, he loses sight of the benign hand that blesses him, and, like
the proud Assyrian monarch, ascribes all his prosperity to his own plans,
and to the effect of his own peculiar management. He surveys the lands he
has purchased, the beautiful buildings he has erected, the wealth he has
accumulated, and in view of these achievements of his hand, as he is
floating on the full tide of prosperity, he is ready to breathe out in
exultation,&mdash;"is not this great Babylon which I have built for the
house of my kingdom, by the might of my power and for the honor of my
majesty."</p>

<p>When success becomes common, man forgets his dependence on Him who
rules in the armies of heaven, and over the affairs of men. It is our
duty as intelligent creatures to exercise our reason in viewing things as
they really are. He, who will not do this, but goes through life
thoughtless, so far resigns the man, and assumes the brute. Even some,
who bear the christian name, proclaim against reason, call her carnal,
and prostrate her as it were at the shrine of enthusiasm. They lean upon
certain frames and feelings of the animal nature. They are so far driven
from men. I say it is our duty as rational intelligences to hold our
station in the scale of being, and to exercise our reason in viewing
things as they are. We ought candidly and solemnly to weigh the blessings
of God, and consider the relation in which we stand to him as our Creator
and Benefactor. Who can tell the value of existence, or number its
countless joys? What a wonderful production is man! He has given us the
most beautiful symmetry of parts,&mdash;has moulded our limbs with
accuracy, and freely bestowed these admirable lineaments of form! He has
formed the ear for sound, and awakened in its vocal chambers the flowing
charms of music, the harmony of rejoicing nature, the dear voices of
parents and children, and the sweet whisperings of love and friendship!
He has moulded the transparent eye, bedded it in its bony socket, and on
its retina painted the universe! He has bid it not only to disclose, all
the varied passions of the soul, but to roll with softness and affection
on the fond companion of our ways, on the countless beauties of nature,
and bid it with infinite ease sweep the entire vault of heaven. He has
set in motion the warm current of life that rolls through our veins,
pouring nourishment, health and animation through all the channels of
existence. It is he who throbs the heart, who heaves the lungs, and who
bids the ten thousand complicated parts of this organized frame move on.
In all this, his goodness is every moment felt, and yet we are
thoughtless of these manifestations of his loving kindness. They are so
common that we have ceased to prize them. When sickness and distress come
upon us, it is then we learn the value of health and ease, and are often
awakened to the reality that the Most High rules.</p>

<p>In view of the trials incident to life, we hear the Psalmist exclaim
"Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have I kept thy word."
This seems to be the lamentable condition of man. When rolling in the
calm tide of uninterrupted prosperity, and rejoicing in the vigor of
health, he forgets there is a God, or becomes thoughtless that the
heavens do rule, and begins, like the king of Babylon, to ascribe all his
success to his own power, foresight and management, and is practically an
atheist. But however thoughtless men may be, yet there is a God who
governs the world, and will so order and direct his providence, that
every one who goes counter to the principles of rectitude is <i>doomed,
inevitably</i> doomed, to suffer the consequences.</p>

<p>There is too much practical atheism in the world. By this we mean that
there are too many of those who acknowledge a God in words, that deny him
in conduct. Every one, who lives upon the bounties of heaven, who enjoys
the sweets of existence, and remains thoughtless of God, is practically
an atheist. As saith Paul, "They profess that they know God, but in works
they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work
reprobate." He, who goes on in the ways of transgression and multiplies
his iniquities, must either believe there is no God, or else conclude
that he does not rule over the affairs of men; and on this ground
flatters himself that he shall escape punishment. And not only so, but in
opposition to the express declaration of Jehovah, he believes that he
shall enjoy a degree of happiness in the indulgence of sin. All such are
driven from those rational reflections and moral principles, which
virtually constitute the man, and have yet to learn, "that the heavens do
rule."</p>

<h2><a name="sermon4"></a>SERMON IV</h2>

<blockquote>"And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall
be with the<br>
beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen,
and<br>
seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the Most High<br>
ruleth in the kingdom of, men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will."<br>
Daniel iv: 32.</blockquote>

<p>Every man, who believes that the path of virtue is thorny, and that of
vice is pleasurable, is not only deceived, but has not yet learned that
the Most High holds the reins of government, and dispenses to his
creatures their rewards and punishments. It is evident, if every man
solemnly believed that a course of sin would bring upon him certain and
unavoidable misery&mdash;and that every species of dishonesty would
lessen his fortune in the world, be would abandon his course, and turn
his feet to the testimonies of God. The transgressor is therefore
deceiving himself, is resting under a strong delusion, and is yet
ignorant that the Almighty rules throughout his vast dominions. Certain
it is that a wicked man was never happy while remaining in that
condition, and it is equally certain that no one ever yet went
unpunished.</p>

<p>To this point we intend to invite your serious attention in this
discourse. The expression in our text, "till thou know that the Most High
ruleth in the kingdom of men," does not only imply a knowledge of the
existence of a Supreme Intelligence, who governs the world, but an
obedience to the moral laws of his empire. On this proposition we purpose
to offer a few rational, and not only rational, but irresistible
arguments. We will first notice the condition of those who are guilty of
heinous crimes, and then come down to the common walks of life, and
bestow a few remarks on those who are indifferent about their condition,
and only guard their conduct so far as comports with the customs and
manners of that portion of the community, who have no higher principle of
action than to be considered respectable among men.</p>

<p>Though we come before the public to defend the doctrines of Christ,
yet, my friends, you will bear in mind that it is also our duty to
enforce his precepts, and exhort to the obedience of the gospel. That we
should point out the road of sin, error and misery, and also endeavor to
throw the light of heavenly truth on the pathway of human life.</p>

<p>We will begin with the murderer, who wantonly embrues his hands in the
blood of his fellow. So far as he has violated the laws of his country,
he is a subject for public execution, and has nothing to hope for, at the
tribunal of human justice. His misery, whether it arise from the
contemplation of an ignominious death, from the fear of detection, or
from the consciousness of having violated the moral principles of his
nature, is alike insupportable, as well as indescribable.</p>

<p>Is he detected? Shut out from the world and confined in his loathsome
cell, he is left to his own reflections, and to all the horrors of the
gathering storm. But even admitting that he should escape detection, and
be left to his own meditations on his deed of blood, he would, like Cain,
breathe out in agony of soul, "my punishment is greater than I can bear!"
He might, indeed, mingle with the busy throng&mdash;he might even smile,
and wear a face of pleasure, but behind this mantIed mask he would
conceal a heart of pain. He might, indeed, gaze upon the landscape,
listen to the songs of the grove, and contemplate the glories of nature,
but the charm, that once gave him ecstatic delight and solid joy, is
vanished from his sight; and all, that once was fair and lovely, wears
the frown of darkness and indignation. He gazes upon little children, and
hears their artless and innocent prattle, reflects what he once was, and
every joy, that sparkles in their eyes, sends a dagger to his heart. The
rustling of a leaf strikes him with terror and alarm, and every passing
breeze bears to his tormented soul the groans of the dying man, and
conscience forces him to listen to the heart-rending tale of wo. Fain
would he fly from himself, and enjoy one hour's repose; but alas! that
God, who rules in the kingdom of men, has written a law in his heart,
where he reads and feels his condemnation, and where conscience sits on
the judgment seat, constantly holds him arraigned at her tribunal, and
fans up in his bosom the burning flames of hell! He may lie down on his
pillow, but spectres haunt his brain; and awake, asleep, at home, abroad,
he finds that he has rendered his own existence a curse. He lives in
misery, and in darkness expires.</p>

<p>Let us next notice the thief, who plunders our property. His crime is
of less magnitude than the above, but his guilt is in proportion. No one
by such means has ever enriched himself. He, who obtains property by
dishonorable means, is ignorant of its value, and will dishonorably spend
it. He has forgotten that God governs the world. Our state-prisons and
penitentiaries not only (so far as human laws are concerned) reveal his
fate, but speak his woes. But suppose he escape detection, and is only
exposed to the naked and fearful grandeur of that law which God has
written in the heart. He hears its thunders, and he feels its fires. He
his taken from some fellow being his hard earnings; and sees him and
perhaps his children mourning their misfortune and suffering the miseries
of adversity. Guilt takes possession of his soul, and misery, which the
hand of time cannot extinguish, rolls its dark waves of damnation upon
him, and drowns his dearest joys, while poverty marks him for her
own.</p>

<p>God has so constituted his plans in the government of the world that
the plunderer cannot prosper. Inward horrors and fears of detection
abstract his mind from the proper duties of life, so that misfortune and
defeat find their way into his plans, which might otherwise by calm
deliberation have succeeded, and disappointment and misery, satiety and
disgust, and all the evils that are the offspring of his iniquity,
commingling in a thousand ways, render his existence wretched. Relying
upon dishonesty for support, he becomes but a midnight beggar. His
slumbers are haunted by frightful dreams; and fear of detection, prisons
and dungeons are torturing his imagination and incessantly sporting with
his broken peace. He is a stranger to those solid joys arising from the
practice of virtue, is doomed to encounter all the miseries that attend
his ill-chosen career, and to drink every drug of wormwood and gall that
heaven has mingled in the cup of dishonor. He lives a nuisance and pest
to society, and dies covered with infamy.</p>

<p>In all this we shall see the truth of our text exemplified, that God
rules in the kingdom of men, and brings punishment, not only upon a
haughty monarch seated on the throne of nations, but upon every
transgressor however obscure may be his condition in the walks of private
life. The sovereign decree of his empire is&mdash;"THOUGH HAND JOIN IN
HAND, YET SHALL THE WICKED NOT GO UNPUNISHED."</p>

<p>But we take our leave of flagitious crimes and proceed to notice men
in the common walks of life. Every man who makes riches, or public honors
the chief end of all his pursuits, and gives all his attention to the
attainment of his object, and over-reaches in bargains whenever an
opportunity offers, or sets various prices on his merchandise, according
to the person with whom he deals&mdash;such a man will never feel himself
filled with riches, nor satisfied with honors. The reasons are obvious.
He commences his career under the impression that happiness, contentment
and all the rational enjoyments of life consist in wealth, and in human
greatness. He soon finds himself in possession of as large a fortune as
he first supposed would make him happy. But his desires for more, having
imperceptibly expanded, he finds within an increased restlessness, and
even greater desires for <i>more</i> than when he first set out. He still
believes, according to his original impression, that happiness lies in
gold; and that the only reason why he has not obtained those solid joys
in possession which he first anticipated, is because he still needs more.
But though wealth may flow upon him in oceans, his cravings for more will
ever swell beyond what earth can give, and leave him a more wretched
being than he was at the commencement of his course. Here is his
loss&mdash;here is his punishment. God has not placed happiness in
wealth. <i>"A competence is all we can enjoy, 0, be content where heaven
can give no more."</i></p>

<p>Or let him rise to that station of honor, which he now believes will
satisfy him, and his ambition would aspire to one more exalted. Let him
govern one kingdom, and he would desire to subjugate another till the
whole world bowed to his nod. And were every star an inhabited world, and
did he possess means to invade them, his ambition would continue to soar
till he ruled the universe, and were there no object left to which he
might still direct his ambition and continue to soar, he would set down
in despair, and, like Alexander the Great, weep and sigh for more worlds
to conquer.</p>

<p>All this restlessness and misery arise from false notions of:
happiness&mdash;from not realizing that the Most High rules in the
kingdom of men&mdash;and from a want of confidence in his word, which
points the rich and the poor alike to that noble path of virtue and
religion, where true happiness and unbroken peace forever reign. By men
embracing virtue, and in their feelings and actions ever acknowledging
the supremacy of Jehovah, inevitably leads to happiness and contentment.
But in doing this we are not to deprive ourselves of the enjoyment of
honest gotten wealth, nor of the rational pursuits and interchanges of
social and domestic life. Religion was not given to deprive us of the
common comforts and conveniences of life, but to sweeten them. Our
Redeemer says, "seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; and
all these things shall be added unto you." Sin and misery in this world
are inseparable: so are righteousness and happiness. If they are not,
then it remains for the advocates for a future retribution to show how
men are to be sufficiently rewarded and punished in the future world.</p>

<p>There is my friends no solid happiness, no permanent satisfaction only
in the contemplation that God governs the world, and in the practice of
pure and rational piety. This you may know by studying your own bosom.
Have any of you thus far spent your days in striving to find perfect
bliss in the various pursuits of life? Have you aspired to one object,
abandoned it, and taken up another? If so, can you say that you have
found the happiness you anticipated, and so earnestly sought? No! What is
the reason? There is one thing needful. Whatever may be your pursuit, if
you are thoughtless that God governs the world, and if instead of
rendering him the homage of a grateful heart, you blaspheme his name, or
are selfish and regardless of the happiness of your fellow creatures, you
must, according to the established laws of his empire, remain in that
same restless and dissatisfied condition till you know by experience that
the heavens do rule&mdash;till you bow to the sublime requirements of his
word. <i>That dissatisfaction</i> varied according to the condition of
moral character is the punishment God sends upon us for our indifference.
From this indifference we may rise to that unquenchable thirst for
riches, already noticed, and our sufferings will receive new accessions
according to our moral light. And from this we may rise to a desire for
honour and power, till we are hurried on by ambition to conquest and
slaughter where we are doomed to suffer all the miseries a Buonaparte
endured. From this we may rise to dishonour, fraud and theft; and as we
rise in crime, our miseries increase in degree, till we imbrue our hands
in innocent blood, and thus render our bosoms a hell and our very
existence a burthen.</p>

<p>Every man is in a condition of uneasiness, suffering, guilt, hardness
of heart and blindness of mind exactly in proportion to his moral
conduct. Let us then be wise;&mdash;and if we desire happiness, let us
seek it in that course where the unerring word of God assures us it can
alone be found. Let us acknowledge "that the heavens do rule," and rest
assured that He, who notices the fall of a sparrow, will not wink at our
evil doings.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon5"></a>SERMON V</h2>

<blockquote>"For what if some did not believe, shall their unbelief make
the faith of God<br>
without effect? God forbid; yea let God be true, but every man a
liar."<br>
Romans iii: 3,4.</blockquote>

<p>The doctrine of salvation by Jesus Christ, is worthy the solemn
consideration of all men. It is this, that rendered a revelation
necessary. It is this that kindled the flame of transport in celestial
bosoms, and raised that triumphant song, "glory to God in the highest, on
earth peace, good will towards men." Salvation is the doctrine of the
Bible, and ought ever to be the theme of the pulpit. Salvation is the
oracle of heaven around which all denominations assemble, receive their
instructions, and believe according to the force of evidence.</p>

<p>Prefaced with these remarks, we will now proceed to state what we
conceive to be the <i>law</i> and <i>gospel</i>&mdash;point out the
distinction between them, and defend the gospel doctrine of salvation of
faith.</p>

<p>The law was a conditional covenant between God and man. It was
predicated on works. Under this covenant, if a man were strictly moral in
his external deportment&mdash;if he lived up to its letter, he was
considered righteous. This covenant was imperfect, because it could be
kept externally without reaching the heart. They could exclaim like the
young man, who came to Jesus&mdash;"all these things have I kept from my
youth up," and still lack the one great point, charity. Therefore by the
deeds of the law no flesh could be justified in the sight of God. The
law, being temporary in its nature, had nothing to do with eternal
things.</p>

<p>Paul says, "sin is the transgression of the law."&mdash;"Where there
is no law there is not the knowledge of sin." From this it appears that
sin, being a transgression of that law, which was given us for the
regulation of our conduct in this life, can receive no punishment in the
future world. If sin should be committed in the future state, then in the
future state it would be punished. The same argument will apply to our
obedience to the law, which can receive, for the same reason, no reward
in that world. "No flesh shall be justified by the deeds of the law."
"Eternal life is the gift of God." If so, then it cannot be "of works,
lest any man should boast." God, being infinite in wisdom, could not have
failed to enact a law so perfect, and so exactly adapted to the nature of
man, that <i>obedience</i> would render him a rich reward, and
<i>disobedience</i> a condign punishment. The wise man says that "the
righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; much more the wicked and the
sinner."</p>

<p>We now turn to the spirit of the law.&mdash;"To love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself is the fulfillment of the
law;" and if we are not to be saved by the law, then our <i>love</i> to
God and each other cannot save us; for that is the law. By what then are
we to be saved? Answer: by the gospel, which is God&rsquo;s love
manifested to his creatures. The conclusion then is that we are not to be
saved by our <i>love</i> to God, but by God&rsquo;s <i>love</i> to us.
This, I presume, no one will dispute. Here then we discern the difference
between the law and the gospel. God&rsquo;s <i>love</i> is the
<i>cause</i> of salvation&mdash;human love is the <i>effect.</i> "Herein
(says John) is love; not that we loved God, but that he loved us." "We
love him <i>because</i> he <i>first</i> loved us." How many did he love?
He so loved the world who were dead in trespasses and sins, that he
freely delivered up his Son for us all&mdash;he by the grace of God
tasted death for every man. This is the gospel-love that God commendeth
towards us, and the love that will finally save us.</p>

<p>Many persons contend that we must love God and do certain duties, or
we cannot be saved. This is preaching ourselves. It is preaching the love
of man as the <i>cause</i> of his salvation, instead of the love of God.
And while thus preaching, they will perhaps at the same time tell the
sinner that God is his enemy. But will the sinner's love make God his
friend?&mdash;will it cause his Creator to love him? No; right the
reverse of this is the doctrine of Christ. "We love God because he first
loved us." If we deny God's <i>first</i> love to the sinner, we then
destroy the very <i>cause</i> by which <i>alone</i> the sinner can be
made to love God. If we make men believe that God is their enemy and
hates them, then we use all the means in our power to drive them from the
bosom of their Father, and keep them in darkness and sin.</p>

<p>The sinner, in this situation, can never be made to serve God, only by
being driven to it by terror, the same as some wretched slave is made to
cower and submit in fear and dread to some revengeful tyrant. But this is
not the service God requires. He requires a service which is delightful,
and in which his creature feels an abundant reward. We grant that men,
under the first covenant, were called upon to fear God. The reason of
this obvious, when we reflect that God had covenanted to bestow certain
blessings upon them, providing they would do their duty. If they failed,
then he would execute the temporal judgments upon them, which the law
points out, and threatens. Under this covenant men had just as much
reason to fear, as they were liable to transgress it.</p>

<p>But when an angel announced the dawn of a better covenant; he said
"fear not, for behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy." In this is
nothing to be feared. All the fear lies in the first, and thunders out to
every sinner, "cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
written in the law to do them?" But John, speaking in view of the second
covenant, says, "there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out
fear, because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in
love." The <i>first</i> covenant is founded on works, and is
<i>conditional</i>;&mdash;but the <i>second</i> is founded on the
immutable promise of God, and is <i>unconditional.</i> In the law, we are
commanded <i>to do</i> according to the reasonableness of its
requirements; but in the gospel we are exhorted <i>to believe</i> in view
of evidence and fact. And as no man can believe, or disbelieve what he
pleases, therefore conditions are excluded.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of gospel? It is good tidings of great joy. It is
life and immortality brought to light at the appearing of our Lord and
Saviour, Jesus Christ, who has abolished death by giving us the assurance
of a resurrection from corruption to incorruption and glory. It is news.
In view of news, what is the first thing necessary? Answer,
<i>belief.</i> It is impossible to work news; therefore the gospel is not
of works. In the law, the first requirement is <i>to do;</i>&mdash;but in
the gospel the first requirement is <i>to believe.</i> The law-covenant
is therefore temporary, fallible and uncertain; but the gospel-covenant
is eternal, infallible, and in all things well ordered and sure. The
<i>first</i> rests on the obedience of the creature, but the
<i>second</i> on the promises of Jehovah. Paul therefore calls it a
better covenant established upon <i>better</i> promises.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone may feel disposed to ask&mdash;whether faith is all
that is necessary? We reply that it is the <i>cause</i> which produces
its effect. Paul answers this question thus&mdash;"We conclude that a man
is justified by faith without the deeds of the law, Do we then make void
the law through faith? God forbid; yea we establish the law." Here let
the question be asked;&mdash;how do we establish the law by <i>faith?</i>
Answer, "Faith will have its, perfect work." But what is that perfect
work, which faith produces? Ans. Faith works love in the soul; and if we
love God, we will keep his commandments. And <i>faith, love</i> and
<i>keeping</i> the commandments are the three exercises, that form the
christian character. Faith is the foundation; works are not. We cannot
begin to build on works. Instead of being the <i>first,</i> they are the
<i>last</i> christian grace. They are the visible <i>effects</i> of an
inward, living faith.</p>

<p>Faith and faith <i>only</i> is the seed rooted and grounded in the
truth, and (to use a Bible figure) it becometh a tree, and produces all
the fruits of the spirit&mdash;love, joy, meekness, temperance,
long-suffering, forbearance. This is what the apostle calls the
"righteousness of faith" in contradistinction to "the righteousness of
the law," produced by fear. Paul compares faith to a good olive tree. The
Jews through unbelief were broken off," and "thou (the Gentile) standest
by faith." Jesus says; " "if ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye
shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it shall
remove." Here, in parable, faith is represented as removing mountains of
sin. He further says&mdash;"Thy <i>faith</i> hath made thee
whole";&mdash;not thy works. Paul exclaims, "Faith works by love,
purifies the heart and overcomes the world." John says, "and this is the
victory that overcometh the world even our faith."</p>

<p>It is a certain fact, that none of these salutary effects are ascribed
to human works. The apostles in no instance say, that <i>works</i> purify
the heart, or overcome the world&mdash;or that this is the victory, even
your <i>works;</i> The whole is ascribed to <i>faith;</i> because that is
the living tree on which the good fruits grow. Works are, in scripture,
called fruits. "By their <i>fruits</i> ye shall know them"&mdash;that is
by their <i>works.</i> "A good tree cannot bring forth evil
<i>fruit</i>." To carry out this figure, we would remark that, fruit can
have no existence till the tree is first produced. Therefore in a gospel
sense, no good works, acceptable to God, can be produced without a true
and living faith. The apostle declares, "without faith it is impossible
to please God." The gospel being good tidings, or news, are you satisfied
that thing necessary? I presume all denominations will assent to the
fact, that faith is the first religious exercise of the creature. We
shall then obey the command of the apostle, and "contend earnestly for
the faith once delivered to the saints."</p>

<p>But asks the reader,what matter is it which is first in order, whether
<i>love, faith</i> or <i>works?</i> I reply that it is a matter of vast
importance, and without understanding this fact, we cannot come to the
knowledge of the truth, even though we should be ever learning. If these
three christian graces <i>faith, love</i> and <i>works,</i> are preached
in a confused and mixed manner, we cannot arrive at a true understanding
of a gospel salvation, neither can we tell the difference between law and
gospel. The law is of works, and the gospel is of faith. And no man can
fulfill the spirit of the law without faith in the gospel. When the
sinner exercises faith in the love and goodness of God in freely giving
him eternal life, which infinitely transcends all other
blessings&mdash;that moment faith works love in his heart, and causes him
to rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. He then loves God
because God first loved him. And when the sinner loves God, he is passed
from death unto life, and that love is the fulfillment of the law.</p>

<p>We are now led to see the consistency of faith being the first step.
It is the very <i>cause</i> that produces <i>love</i> to God, and
<i>love</i> induces us to keep the commandments. "Faith works by love,"
and "if ye love me," says Jesus, "ye will keep my commandments."</p>

<p>We will now introduce an example, which will plainly show the
distinction between the law and gospel and in what manner they affect the
sinner. Suppose a king sentences six of his subjects to imprisonment
during life, and commands them to spend their days in hard labor. They
are put in confinement, refuse to obey his commands&mdash;refuse to
labor, and in the midst of their miseries curse his name. They are now in
disobedience under the condemnation of the law.</p>

<p>The king says to his only Son, I love those subjects and I covenant
with you to set them free in three years. The Son says, Father I delight
to do thy will. Let me go and reveal to them, the glad tidings of this
covenant promise. The king answers&mdash;my Son, in the fullness of time
I will send you. Let them remain, one year, under the law. But says the
Son, they are now transgressing your law, and need instruction. The king
replies, I will send my servant to enforce that law. Let him go and
inform the prisoners, that I am angry with them for their conduct; and if
they will obey my commands, and labor faithfully, they shall have
excellent food and good clothing as a reward. But if they will not
comply, they shall be chained, and kept on bread and water as a
punishment for their disobedience.</p>

<p>The servant goes and delivers to them this message. Three of those
subjects, for fear of the punishment and in <i>hope</i> of the reward,
obey the king, and outwardly respect his commands, but perhaps have
little, or no love for him. (Here we see the righteousness of the law
which is not acceptable to God.) They accordingly receive, day by day,
the promised reward. But the other three prisoners despise these
conditions and refuse to obey. They are chained, fed on bread and water,
and meet their deserts.</p>

<p>Here, then, are six prisoners laboring under the law, and groaning in
bondage with no hopes of deliverance. The law knows of no
deliverance&mdash;no redemption. It simply serves as a school master to
teach them the difference between right and wrong&mdash;to teach them the
will of the king, and thus prepare them to receive a better covenant,
which is to be revealed to them by the king's Son. But under the covenant
they now are, they have no motives to prompt them to obedience, but the
<i>fear</i> of punishment and the <i>hope</i> of reward. In our next,
this will be fully illustrated.</p>

<blockquote>"For what if some did not believe, shall their unbelief make
the faith of God<br>
without effect? God forbid; yea let God be true, but every man a
liar."<br>
Romans iii: 3,4.</blockquote>

<p>We resume the argument, in this discourse, concerning those prisoners
brought forward in our last. We left them in bondage under the sentence
of the law with no hopes of deliverance. The first year rolls away. The
king says, my son, the time has come&mdash;go, and reveal my love to the
prisoners by bringing the promise of their redemption to light. The son
flies on wings of love, enters the prison and exclaims&mdash;I bring you
good tidings of great joy. My father, the king, is your friend. He loves
you; and that love has induced him to proclaim your liberation as a free
gift. He has promised (and he cannot lie) that in two years from this day
you shall be free. This covenant, so far as concerns its fulfillment, is
unconditional. Believe, and you will be saved, by faith in the promise,
from your present fears, and condemnation under the law.</p>

<p>Those stubborn prisoners see a sufficiency of evidence to believe the
promise. They exercise unshaken faith in this second covenant between the
father and son. This faith works by love in their hearts, and purifies
them from disobedience. Their souls melt in view of the love and goodness
of the king revealed to them by his son. In fine, they love him because
he first loved them. They are now saved by faith in his promise from not
only all their miseries and sorrows, but from their disobedience, and
look forward with joy to the day of redemption. Here we perceive the
<i>"righteousness of faith,"</i> which far exceeds the <i>"righteousness
of the law."</i> They now delight to obey the king because they are under
the influence of love.</p>

<p>Here let the question be asked&mdash;are these three men to be let out
of prison at the appointed time because they believe the promise, or love
and obey the king? They are not. Their redemption depended on the truth
and faithfulness of the king's promise which he made to his son, and that
promise would have been fulfilled, even if it had not been revealed to
them till the day of their deliverance. They are not to be set free as a
reward for their <i>faith, love</i> and <i>obedience.</i> They have great
peace and joy in believing that promise. They are in the happy enjoyment
of a salvation by faith, and that is all the reward they deserve, or have
reason to expect. We here perceive that these three men are made to
establish the law of their king by faith in the good news he sent them by
his son, which is to them a gospel. We now see the propriety of the
apostle's language&mdash;"We conclude that a man is justified by faith
without the deeds of the law. Do we then make void the law through faith?
God forbid; yea we establish the law." We also perceive that these three
men are not to be liberated from prison because they believe the promise,
or love and obey the king. But on the contrary it is the king's love and
promise to them which sets them free.</p>

<p>Let us now notice the other three prisoners. One says I do not believe
that we shall ever be released from prison. It is too good news to be
true. Well, shall his unbelief make the king's promise of none effect?
The king forbid; yea let the king be true, but that man a liar. But let
it be remembered that he cannot be proved a liar unless he is liberated.
Would you now go and tell that man&mdash;sir, because you will
not<i>believe,</i> you shall never come forth from prison? But do you not
perceive that by so doing you would give the king the lie? It would be
saying that his promise was good for nothing unless the man would believe
it. It would be contending that the unbelief of this prisoner will make
the king's promise of none effect.</p>

<p>The other two prisoners exclaim--we believe this <i>second</i>
covenant, but it must bear some resemblance to the <i>first</i> which is
conditional. We believe that we shall get out of this prison if we
continue to serve the king as, we have heretofore, by keeping his
commandments.&mdash;Here are two men trusting in the <i>first
covenant</i> for deliverance. They are trusting in the law. They are
depending on their own <i>love</i> and <i>faithfulness</i> to the king
for redemption, and not on the king's <i>love, promise</i> and
<i>faithfulness</i> to them. Here then we see the righteousness of the
law in those two prisoners; in another we see the effect of unbelief; and
in those three who remained disobedient under the first covenant, we see
the righteousness which is of faith when they heard the glad tidings of
redemption in the second covenant.</p>

<p>At length the day of their redemption dawns. They are all brought to
the knowledge of the truth. Those three prisoners, who were saved by
faith in the promise during those two years of suspense, now find their
faith lost in certainty. Their salvation, by faith has come to an end.
And so has the unbelief, condemnation and doubtings of the other three
prisoners. In one word&mdash;the <i>belief</i> and <i>unbelief</i> of the
six are lost in knowledge, and they burst out in songs of deliverance So
we perceive that a salvation by faith, and a condemnation in unbelief can
last no longer than till we come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>Let us now apply this to the scriptures. Man sinned, and not only
involved himself in guilt and misery, but was sentenced to that very
death with which God threatened him&mdash;"Dust thou art and unto dust
shalt thou return." Here was the end of the first covenant, and the
termination of all the miseries of life. It is evident from revelation as
well as reason that man at death drops to a state of insensibility, and
knows no more till he is made alive in Christ, who is himself the second
covenant. The language of scripture is, the dead know not any
thing&mdash;they sleep&mdash;and the apostle (in 1. Cor. xv. chap.)
reasons that if there be no resurrection, then there will be no future
existence&mdash;that they which are fallen asleep in Christ are
perished&mdash;that preaching was vain&mdash;faith was also vain, and
that the christians were yet in their sins. On such language as this, I
can put no other construction than that the resurrection is our salvation
and eternal life, our deliverance from sin and imperfection. Under the
first covenant the resurrection in Christ was not revealed to the human
family, and they remained of course under the sentence of condemnation
with no hopes of a future existence. "By the offense of one judgment came
upon all men to condemnation." Obedience to the law was enforced by
threatenings on the one hand, and promises of temporal rewards on the
other, which were communicated to the fathers by the prophets.</p>

<p>But God has in these latter days spoken unto us by his Son, and
through him revealed the second covenant in which he "gave him the
heathen for an inheritance, and the utter most parts of the earth for a
possession," and declared him to be the resurrection and life of the
world. If in the divine counsels no Christ had been provided, the human
family it appears would have remained in eternal slumber. They would have
known but one covenant, which would have rewarded and punished them
according to their deeds, and consigned them to the regions of the dead.
"But since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the
dead."</p>

<p>God saw fit to keep the human family for four thousand years under the
first covenant, without the knowledge of eternal life through the
resurrection of the dead. But it was, at length, "made manifest by the
appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and
brought life and immortality to light through the gospel." Yes, he first
brought it to light, and through his apostle declared "In hope of eternal
life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began, but hath
in due time manifested his word through preaching." This promise of
eternal life, all men are called upon to believe. The moment they
believe, they are saved by faith, and are at peace; and they that doubt
are damned&mdash;they are already under condemnation. But shall their
unbelief make God's promise of eternal life of none effect? God forbid;
yea let God be true but every man a liar. "For he hath concluded them all
in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all."</p>

<p>We have now noticed the two covenants&mdash;the <i>law</i> and
<i>gospel</i>&mdash;have pointed out the distinction between
them&mdash;shown that all <i>conditions</i> are confined to the law, and
that the gospel is <i>unconditional,</i> and justly requires our faith
and confidence. We will now bring to view the scripture doctrine of
salvation by faith, and show that divine truth must have an existence
before we can be called upon to believe.</p>

<p>All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is based upon eternal
and unchanging truth. Truth is one of the attributes of Jehovah and the
unshaken pillar that supports the throne of eternity. In truth and
righteousness he governs the world, and by an omnipotent arm wields the
destinies of men. Truth is the sun of divine revelation pouring its beams
on intelligent creation and calling upon all men to believe. If a man
assert that which does exist, it is a truth; but if he assert that which
does not exist, it is a falsehood. Whatever has an existence in the
compass of reality is a truth to be believed, and whatever has no such
existence is a falsehood not to be believed. It is beyond the power of
man to create one solitary divine truth. All that he can do is to declare
the existence of that which may be hidden from others, or relate some
circumstances respecting that which does absolutely exist. An absolute
truth must, therefore, be presented to the understandings of men before
they can be called upon to believe it, or before they can be called
<i>believers</i> for embracing it, or <i>unbelievers</i> for rejecting
it. No man can be an unbeliever for rejecting that which does not
exist.</p>

<p>We now commence plain argument by using great plainness of speech. In
preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ truth must be the foundation. If
then truth must exist before men can be called upon to believe, the
question arises what is <i>that truth</i> which the second covenant
reveals for the belief of mankind? Answer, it is the record God hath
given of his Son. But what is the <i>record?</i> Let John
answer&mdash;"this is the record, God hath given us <i>eternal life</i>,
and this life is in his Son." It then follows that we are to believe that
God has given us eternal life in his Son before the world began, and
unchangeably promised it. Paul says&mdash;"In hope of eternal life which
God that cannot lie promised before the world began." If we believe the
record, we are in the scriptures recognized as <i>believers</i> and are
saved by faith, and will of course exhibit in our life and conversation
the righteousness of faith.</p>

<p>The great error of any who read the Bible, consists in supposing there
is but one salvation. But there are two. The <i>first</i> is a special
salvation by belief in the promise, and the <i>second</i> is our eternal
salvation beyond the grave, where we shall be brought to the knowledge of
the truth involved in the promise, and to <i>know</i> shall be life
eternal. Faith shall then be lost in certainty. Now if we disbelieve the
record will that make it false? No; our unbelief cannot alter the fact.
Let the record then be proclaimed to every creature&mdash;saying God has
promised and given you eternal life in Christ before the world began, and
calls upon all to believe it. But suppose they should all reject it
saying we do not believe one word of it, would their <i>unbelief</i> make
the promise or record false? No. Would not then the record prove true? It
would. Then the whole world would, of course, receive that eternal life
which is promised and given them in Christ. No, says the objector, they
will not believe. But can their unbelief make God's promise of none
effect? Can it put that truth out of existence and make it a falsehood?
We would ask the objector, what will they not believe? Answer; they will
not believe that God has given them eternal life in his Son. Very
well,&mdash;then the whole amount of the objection is that God has given
them eternal life in Christ, but they will not believe it, and because
they will not believe it, they never shall obtain it! Then we must
contend (if they never obtain it) that it was never given to them, and if
not given, then the record is false; because the record declares that God
has given them eternal life in his Son. It then follows that their
unbelief can make the faithfulness of God without effect by rendering the
word, he has given, false.</p>

<p>But says the objector it ought to be stated conditionally as
follows&mdash;God first calls upon men to believe, and if they will
believe, then Christ will become their Saviour, and then they will
receive eternal life in him and not before. But does not the objector see
that he has stated <i>no fact</i> for them to believe in order to make
Christ their Saviour? I ask what does God call upon them to believe?
There must be some truth presented before men can be called upon to
believe. God calls upon men to believe, what?&mdash;That Christ is their
Saviour? But you said he was not their Saviour till after they believed.
It then follows, according to the objector's statement, that he is not
the Saviour of unbelievers. Now do you not perceive that if you should
call upon them to believe that he was their Saviour, you would call upon
them to believe a lie?&mdash;that you would call upon them to believe
what did not exist? And what does not exist cannot be true. Grant says
the objector that he is the Saviour of the world, still as many as do not
believe in him shall never be saved. But how can he be the Saviour of a
man, he never saves? Two individuals are drowning in the water; you exert
all your power to save them, but fail. Can you call yourself the saviour
of those two men from temporal death? Impossible. In order for Christ to
be called the Saviour of the world, he must save the world; otherwise
there is not a shadow of propriety in giving him that name. And John says
"We have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the
Saviour of the world"&mdash;"We know, indeed, that this is the Messiah
the Saviour of the world."</p>

<p>In our next, we will conclude this subject, and trust we shall do it
to the satisfaction of our readers.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon7"></a>SERMON VII</h2>

<blockquote>"For what if some did not believe, shall their unbelief make
the faith of God<br>
without effect? God forbid; yea let God be true, but every man a
liar."<br>
Romans iii: 3,4.</blockquote>

<p>We now resume the argument in reference to Christ the Saviour of men,
as we proposed in our last. We here inquire of the objector&mdash;do you
then grant that he is the Saviour of all men&mdash;the Saviour of the
world as the scriptures declare? If so, we assure you that, he will save
the number of whom he is declared to be the Saviour. But, replies the
objector, he is not the Saviour of any man till he believes. We
ask&mdash;till he believes what? Why, replies the objector, till he
believes that Christ is his Saviour&mdash;if he believes so, it will be
so. Let us understand this&mdash;you say <i>he is not</i> the Saviour of
an unbeliever, still he must believe that he <i>is,</i> and that will
make him so. Then he must first believe a lie and that will create a
truth. This is (as Paul says) "turning the truth of God into a lie." But
let us notice the record. "This is the record, God hath given us eternal
life, and this life is in his Son." Do you grant, that God has given
eternal life in Christ to every man? No, says the objector. Very well,
then they cannot be called upon to believe it. Finally, says the
objector, grant that he has. This being granted, we would ask, whether
they will not come in possession of it, if God's promise stands?
Certainly. But, replies the objector, it is not theirs, till they
believe. Then the record is not true till they believe it; because, on
this principle, they must first believe, that they have eternal life in
Christ before it exists, and believing this lie will create it.</p>

<p>But, replies the objector, it is impossible that any man has eternal
life given him in Christ, till he believes. We then ask, what truth do
you wish him to believe, so that he may obtain this eternal life? The
fact is, there is none. He must believe <i>this truth,</i> itself because
it is the <i>record,</i> but <i>this,</i> you have taken from him. You
cannot call upon a man to believe, till you admit the existence of that
very truth you wish him to believe. In order fully to expose the
inconsistency of this conditional salvation, we will introduce an
example. Suppose a father tell his servant, I have a son in London,
nineteen years of age, who is in poverty and distress. I have given him
in my will five thousand dollars, and I promise that it shall he put into
his possession in two years. It is recorded and that record is true. Go
my servant, and proclaim to him glad tidings of great joy, and call upon
him to believe, so that he may enjoy a salvation by faith during those
two years of suspense, and be made happy even amidst his wants by looking
forward to when it shall be put into his possession.</p>

<p>The servant sets out on his mission, and believes that he understands
his errand. Being arrived, he addresses him as follows&mdash;Son, your
father is very rich, and he has not willed you five thousand dollars, nor
given it to you on record; and he never will, unless you <i>first
believe</i> that he has. But, replies the son, according to your message,
if I should believe that he has given me five thousand dollars, I should
believe a lie. Let my father give the money, deposit it in some bank;
send me evidence of the fact, and with joy I will believe him. Well
replies the servant you are a disobedient, stubborn unbeliever! because,
if you would only believe so, it would be so, and you would have the
money in two years.</p>

<p>You perceive (dear reader) that this servant has presented no truth
for this son to believe. He wishes to give this son the impression that
the obtaining of this fortune depends on his <i>believing,</i> and not on
the <i>testament record,</i> and <i>faithfulness</i> of his father. In
fact, he denies the existence of the father's <i>will,</i> and the
<i>record,</i> and requires the son to believe a lie so as to create the
truth. The servant does not understand his message, and the son does not
know on what certainty to rest for the money.</p>

<p>In the same manner we are called upon to secure an
<i>interest</i>&mdash;an eternal life in the Saviour. They will not admit
its existence till we believe. Then <i>belief</i> must create it. But may
we spend our last breath in convincing poor sinners that it is already
secured in Christ for them, so that they may believe, and live by faith
on the son of God.</p>

<p>This father sends another messenger. He tells this son of the goodness
of his father, and that he has <i>willed</i> him five thousand dollars,
that the <i>will</i> is put on record, and that this fortune will be put
into his possession in two years. The son does not believe it. Now he is
an unbeliever. But does his unbelief alter the truth of the <i>will</i>
or of the record. No. The certainty, of his obtaining the money, rests on
the faithfulness of his kind parent. This servant perseveres, uses
convincing arguments and the son at length believes he is saved by faith
from all his miseries, and he rejoices with joy unspeakable. But his
<i>believing</i> does not make the <i>record</i> any more true than it
was before he believed it. It simply alters his present condition by
kindling in his bosom the joys arising from faith and
anticipation.&mdash;We have now answered the objections that would
naturally be brought forward by those who believe that our eternal
salvation is predicated on conditions. As <i>works</i> are not the
requirements of the gospel only so far as they flow from faith in the
truth, and as <i>faith</i> must precede works, therefore the truth of our
eternal life in Christ, must exist previous to our believing.
Consequently all conditions are excluded from the gospel covenant.</p>

<p>We will now meet the objector on the doctrine of election and
reprobation, the substance of which is as follows&mdash;After man fell,
God was pleased to provide a Saviour for a part of the human family. That
elect number he chose in Christ before the foundation of the world, gave
them eternal life in him, and for them only he tasted death. The gospel
is now to be preached to the whole world, and as long as they reject it,
they are unbelievers. But the elect shall sooner, or later, all be
brought to believe.</p>

<p>We will examine the foundation on which this statement rests. To bring
it clearly before you, we will take an example. Suppose there is a
congregation of one hundred persons. Fifty of them were elected to
everlasting life before the foundation of the world&mdash;were secured by
a Saviour, and the rest were reprobated to endless wo. For them no
Saviour was designed, and no eternal life ever has, or ever will be given
them in him. Suppose a sermon is preached to those one hundred; and the
fifty, who are elected, believe the record of their eternal life, are
brought to the obedience of faith, while the other fifty remain unmoved.
The preacher turns upon them and pronounces them <i>unbelievers.</i> But
In what sense are they unbelievers? There has been no truth presented to
them, which they disbelieve. Must they believe that Christ is their
Saviour, or that they have an eternal life in him? But they would in such
case believe a lie. If they believed right the reverse of the
elect,&mdash;<i>believed</i> that God was their enemy and that Christ was
not their Saviour, they would be <i>believers.</i> But if they believed
what the fifty converts did, they would be <i>unbelievers.</i> We here
repeat one premise laid down in our last discourse-viz. In order for any
man to be styled a <i>believer</i> or <i>unbeliever</i>, there must first
be presented some truth for him to embrace or reject.</p>

<p>Now either God has given us eternal life in Christ before the world
began, or he has not. If he has, then we are <i>unbelievers</i> if we
reject it. If he has not given it, and should we still believe that he
has, we would then believe a lie. But neither our <i>belief,</i> or
<i>unbelief</i> can ever alter the fact.</p>

<p>God has "chosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world that
we should be holy and without blame before him in love; having
predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself
according to the good pleasure of his will." * * * "Having made known
unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he
hath purposed in himself; that in the dispensation of the fullness of
times, he might gather together, in one, all things in Christ, both which
are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him." Some apply the above
to the elect. But it embraces all things in heaven and earth, which are
to be gathered together in Christ, and be new creatures. In addition to
this we will introduce two more passages "Who hath saved us, and called
us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
began." "In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
before the world began." In these scriptures we are assured <i>first,</i>
that God chose us in Christ, before the foundation of the
word&mdash;<i>second,</i> that he saved us according to his own purpose
and grace before the world began, and <i>third</i> that he promised
eternal life before the world began. These things being embraced in his
original plan, and purpose, their performance is therefore certain as
that the whole plan of God will be carried unto execution.</p>

<p>There is, in my humble opinion, a strange inconsistency in the common
doctrine. They contend that on account of the transgression of our first
parent, all mankind were fallen creatures and even came into existence
totally depraved. To show the justice of God in the constitution of our
nature, they contend that Adam was our covenant head, and had he
maintained his original purity, we would also have stood perfect in
holiness, and no one would have had any reason to complain. Now since
Adam has fallen, and involved us in ruin, it is equally just in God that
we should share the fate of our covenant head in the one instance as in
the other. But if we make use of this same argument in relation to
Christ, the second Adam&mdash;if we contend that he was the covenant head
of every man, that the covenant was not made for <i>this,</i> but for the
<i>future</i> world&mdash;that this covenant of grace being made between
the Father and the Son, was to stand independent of man&mdash;that
eternal life was promised and given us in him before the world
began&mdash;that as our covenant head, he resisted all temptations, and
perfectly fulfilled the law&mdash;that he died, and appeared alive beyond
the tomb free from temptation, and in a holy and immortal constitution.
If we contend for this, making use of their own arguments, saying that it
is just as rational that we should appear in the image of Christ in the
future world as that we should come into this world in the image of Adam,
they will pronounce the argument so far as applicable to Adam, <i>sound
logic</i>, but so far as this same argument of theirs is applied by
Universalists to Christ, they pronounce it perfect jargon.</p>

<p>But, says the objector, there is one point you have not settled, and I
will here rest the whole of my argument upon it. It is this&mdash;God
has, in no instance, promised eternal to <i>unbelievers;</i> and unless
you can prove that the promise does extend to them, your arguments must
fall like rottenness to the ground. We have certainly proved this, and to
attend to the objector's request would but be, in some measure, going
over the ground already occupied. We will, however, just touch this point
again. We will introduce the following words of Paul to Titus. "In hope
of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world
began."</p>

<p>If God promised his creatures eternal life before the world began,
will they not obtain it? They will for this passage says that he
<i>cannot lie.</i> But says the objector, he has not promised it to the
unbeliever. We would then inquire, what is it that constitutes him an
<i>unbeliever?</i> Why do you call him an <i>unbeliever?</i> Do you say
because he disbelieves the truth of God&rsquo;s promise? Then you must,
of course, admit the truth of God's promise to him. If so, it must stand,
for God cannot lie. You cannot call upon a sinner <i>to believe,</i>
until you admit the existence of <i>that very truth,</i> you wish him to
believe, God's promise of eternal life in Christ, is the gospel we are
called upon to believe with a sincere heart. If you contend that it is
promised to an elect number only, and not to the reprobates, then if they
should all be brought to the knowledge of the truth, what would they
believe? Ans. The elect would believe the promise of eternal life was
made to them, the reprobates would believe right the reverse of the
elect, and all would be believers. No, says the objector, the reprobates
ought to believe just as the elect do. But in this case, they would
believe that they also have the promise of eternal life. This would be
believing a lie, because you say that God has not made them that promise?
How would you preach to such persons? If you called upon them to believe
the truth of the gospel, which is eternal life, you would call upon them
to believe a lie. How can you extricate yourself from this difficulty?
But inquires the objector, how do you know that God has promised eternal
life to all? Ans. Because the scriptures do call all men either
<i>believers,</i> or <i>unbelievers</i>, in view of the promise that God
has made. Take away that promise and belief or unbelief respecting it can
no longer have an existence&mdash;<i>Believers</i> and <i>unbelievers</i>
would be no more.</p>

<p>But says the objector this is not proof that eternal life is promised
to an <i>unbeliever.</i> Well I am surprised at this assertion of my
opponent! First, I ask, what do you call a believer? Ans. One who
believes that God has promised, and given him eternal life in Christ
before the world began. Then, of course, an <i>unbeliever</i> must be
one, to whom God has also promised and given eternal life in Christ
before the world, but will not believe it. But says the objector this
cannot be. I would then ask whether eternal life was not promised, and
given in Christ to the <i>believer</i> before he believed it? Certainly.
It must have been the truth before he could believe. Well, what was he at
that time? An <i>unbeliever</i> of course. Then eternal is promised to
all, because it is the lack of faith in <i>that never failing promise</i>
of Jehovah that constitutes an unbeliever. But says the objector&mdash;a
man "must <i>do</i> so and so," or he cannot be saved. This is not
correct; he must <i>believe,</i> or he cannot be saved. We are saved by
faith in the promise and are permitted to look forward with satisfaction
and joy to an immortal existence where we shall be free from sin, sorrow
and pain. This faith and hope fill the soul with love to God, and induce
us to break off our sins by righteousness. So a salvation by faith can
only be enjoyed in this life, and is to end when faith and hope are lost
in certainty and in joy. Though only few are saved by faith, yet all
shall know the Lord from the greatest to the least, whom to know is life
eternal.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon8"></a>SERMON VIII</h2>

<blockquote>"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee,<br>
 Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."<br>
 John iii. 3.</blockquote>

<p>As we have in the last three sermons dwelt particularly on a salvation
by <i>faith,</i> we will take the liberty to introduce the subject of the
new birth next in order, as it will be, more readily, retained by the
reader, in this connexion than otherwise. Indeed, it hears a strong
resemblance to them so far as the subject of faith is concerned in our
present exposition. But whoever is a careful reader of the New Testament,
will discover that the subject of faith, and the genuine repentance which
that faith produces, is not of trivial moment.</p>

<p>There is no subject of divine revelation, on which more has been said,
preached and written than the one, which we are now about to consider. It
has been brought forward by men of talents and erudition as an
insuperable barrier against Universal Salvation, and their several
adherents have taken it for granted, that it can never be explained in
harmony with the sentiment, that all men shall eventually obtain eternal
life through the Redeemer of men. But these impressions have arisen from
the fact, that they have taken their own views and explanations to be
scripturally correct, and from these premises, they have drawn
conclusions utterly opposed to the final holiness and happiness of
God&rsquo;s intelligent creation. They have supposed the new birth to be
some mysterious change produced by some mysterious operation of the
divine spirit on the mind, and that it is in substance a miracle.</p>

<p>One denomination has contended that if a man once obtained this
change, he was safe, could never "finally fall from grace," but would
eventually land in the kingdom of immortal glory. Several other
denominations admit the new birth to be the same change already noticed,
but contend that the subject may fall from grace, and be finally lost.
Here then the man, who was, according to their views, <i>born again,</i>
might still never see the kingdom of God beyond the grave. On this
principle the new birth would be no security, that any one would obtain
heaven. According to this sentiment, a man might be born again, fall
away, and be born again "until seven times," and in the end not see the
kingdom of God. Those, who advocate this sentiment, believe that
<i>faith</i> and <i>repentance</i> prerequisites to the new birth, and
also believe in the salvation of infants.</p>

<p>This being so, it will come to pass that half of the world will be
saved, inasmuch as about that number die in what may be, justly termed an
infant state. But of those, who come to years of accountability, they
believe but few will be saved. So the greater proportion of those, who
will finally surround the throne of God, will he those, who have never
been born again according to their views. It will not, I presume, be
contended, that infants who, they believe, are totally depraved, ever
exercise <i>faith,</i> or experience the <i>new birth</i> in this
life.</p>

<p>From the above views, I shall take the liberty to dissent, and may
probably differ some from the expositions given by others. It is evident
that Jesus Christ in his instructions frequently brought forward some
natural facts plainly understood by those whom he addressed, in order
more clearly to illustrate his subject, and then made his illustrations
so nearly resemble that natural fact, that no man could possible
misunderstand him, unless he had been led into tradition by blind guides.
In the context, he makes allusion to natural birth, of which every man
knows the, meaning, and says to Nicodemus, "that which is born of the
flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit."</p>

<p>Natural birth pre-supposes the perfect formation of the human body by
that secret energy of nature, God only can comprehend. But that
formation, itself, is not birth. Birth is that operation, that introduced
us into this world. We are now flesh and blood, which cannot inherit the
kingdom. What is born of the flesh is flesh. We must now be born again
from mortal to immortality, otherwise we could not see the kingdom of
God.</p>

<p>Must not man be born of a woman in order to see this world? Can he
look upon the beautiful objects of creation, or contemplate these
countless wonders of the Almighty before be is born into being? He
cannot. All without exception will admit, that it is impossible for any
man to enter this natural world, in which we live, without birth. So it
is equally impossible to enter the kingdom of God without being born
<i>again</i> in the strictest sense of the word. A man cannot "be born
again" ten, or twenty years, nor even <i>one day</i> before be sees the
kingdom of God, any more than he could be born twenty days before he came
forth out of the womb. As natural birth cannot take place any given time
before we enter this world, but is the <i>circumstance</i> that
introduces us, so a <i>second birth</i> cannot take place any given time
before we enter the kingdom of God in the next world but is the <i>very
thing,</i> that shall introduce us into it; and the moment we are born
again, we shall see it,&mdash;we shall be spirit, and beyond the dominion
of death and sin. He that is born of the flesh, <i>is flesh,</i> so long
as he lives; and he that is born of the spirit <i>is spirit.</i> As we
now "bear the image of the earthly" through a <i>natural</i> birth, "so
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly" through a <i>spiritual</i>
birth. And as no man in this world is a spirit, so no man has in reality
passed the new birth. When we were born into this world, we were brought
from insensibility to an existence entirely new. So in order to enter the
kingdom of God, which is not of this world, we must be born again from
the insensibility of death into a new and happy existence beyond the
grave.</p>

<p>The question now arises, when does this new birth take place? We reply
when this mortal puts on immortality through a resurrection. When we
shall be aroused from the sleep of death to a precipient existence in
heaven&mdash;when we shall awake satisfied with the likeness of God.
Paul, in the xv. chap. 1. Cor. plainly states that the spiritual body is
prepared and put on after death. Birth then must <i>follow,</i> not
<i>precede</i> that spiritual body. It is impossible that birth should
take place, till the body is first prepared. Man's natural body is
organized in the womb, and then born into this world. He drops to a state
of insensibility in death, a reorganization of the spiritual body takes
place to the natural eye imperceptible, and its nature indestructible. It
is gradually brought forward through a resurrection similar to the grain
of wheat to which Paul compares it, is awakened to a conscious existence,
and bears the image of the heavenly as it once bore the image of the
earthy. The resurrection is therefore every moment progressing, and every
man is raised in his own order of time.</p>

<p>But says the reader, if the resurrection be the new birth, then
Christ, himself must have been born again, in order to enter the kingdom
of God! Certainly. But inquires the reader, where do the scriptures teach
that Christ was ever born again? In Colossians chap. i. 15. are these
words&mdash;"Who [Christ] is the image of the invisible God, the <i>first
born</i> of every creature." This cannot mean that he was the first born
into this state of existence; but he was the first one whom human eyes
ever saw alive beyond the destruction of death to die no more, and the
only one that mortal eye will ever see, for he arose in his natural body,
(being the only true witness, appointed of God,) to bring life and
immortality to light through the gospel.</p>

<p>But that passage, says the reader, does not satisfy me, that Christ
was born again. Then listen once more&mdash;verse 18&mdash; "who is the
beginning, the <i>first born</i> from the dead that in all things he
might have the pre-eminence." Rev. chap. i. 5. "Jesus Christ the faithful
witness, and the <i>first begotten</i> from the dead." Here it is plainly
stated that he is the "first born from the dead"&mdash;"the <i>first
begotten</i> from the dead" These scriptures in connexion with several
others, that might be quoted, prove that Christ was born again, and that
the resurrection is called birth.</p>

<p>It is evident that man falls to a state of insensibility in death, and
remains in sleep while the spiritual body is forming out of those subtle
materials, that at death pass into <i>hades;</i> and when the
reorganization is completed, the new being is born into the kingdom of
immortal glory. A drowning man, we know, falls to a state of
unconsciousness. Fainting&mdash;yes, even a night's sleep proves that the
mind is susceptible of falling into insensibility, or suspending its
mental operations, and disproves the notion of its entering a future
state, only through a resurrection of the dead. This fact is not only
substantiated by reason, but it is the doctrine of Revelation. The wise
man says, "the dead know not any thing." Paul, in the xv. chap. 1. Cor.
predicates the truth of our resurrection on the fact that Christ rose
from the dead; and on this ground he reasons, that if there be no
resurrection, then preaching is vain, faith is also vain, the christians
were yet in their sins, and they that were fallen asleep in Christ were
perished, and concludes by saying, "let us eat, drink, for tomorrow we
die." Suppose a christian should this moment die, and, according to
common opinion, enter immediately on an immortal existence. Could we now
say&mdash;if there be no resurrection, he is fallen asleep in Christ and
perished? No, because, instead of being perished, <i>i.e.
annihilated,</i> he would remain in infinite happiness and glory, even if
there should, never, be any resurrection. So you perceive that Paul did
not believe any one could enter eternity only through a resurrection. He
believed, they would fall asleep in Christ, and in that sleep remain till
in Christ they were made alive. He embraces the whole in the following
words&mdash;"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead."</p>

<p>When the sentence of death was pronounced upon Adam, which was to pass
upon all men, the promise of a Saviour then made, was, it appears, not
understood. Their posterity looked forward for a temporal king, and had
no idea of an immortal existence beyond the "narrow house." Death the
king of terrors, was not yet disarmed of his sting by the resurrection of
our triumphant Redeemer. This truth was not yet revealed to men. Here the
human family were without hope, and trembling at the darkness&mdash;the
seven fold darkness of the tomb. No ray of light and joy beamed from that
cheerless mansion to ease the aching heart, or dispel that melancholy
gloom, which pervaded the parental bosom when gazing for the last time
upon the struggles of a dying child.</p>

<p>Here was a world born into existence under the certain sentence of
death, and groaning in the bondage of corruption, without any hope of
being delivered from it, by an immortal birth, "into the glorious liberty
of the children of God." In this period of anxiety and distress, the glad
tidings were proclaimed to the shepherds on the plains of Judea,
announcing the birth of the Saviour of the world. A new birth, which is
not mentioned in the <i>old</i> Testament, was at length proclaimed by a
Saviour in the <i>new</i>. He died on the cross, and was "the first born
from the dead."</p>

<p>He is the head of every man, by the grace of God tasted death for
every man, and rose again for their justification. The scriptures declare
that "we shall be saved by his life"&mdash;that he is "the bread of God
that cometh down from heaven and giveth life to the world." He is our
way, our truth and life, and "because he lives we shall live also." "As
in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive," or born from
the dead. And he that is made alive in Christ is a new creature, old
things are passed away&mdash;all things are become new.</p>

<p>But says the reader, though the resurrection of Jesus is set forth by
a birth from death, yet the resurrection of the human family is never so
represented. You mistake. Out of the many passage that might be adduced,
we have room, in this discourse, for only one. It shall, however, be
satisfactory. In Romans, 8th chapter, Paul says, " Because the creature
itself also, shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
glorious liberty of the children of God; for we know that the whole
creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now." [We would
remark, that the word <i>creature,</i> is <i>ktisis</i> in the Greek, and
is the same that is rendered <i>creation</i> in the next verse.] In this
quotation, you perceive, that Paul represents the whole creation as
groaning in travail pains, and declares that the whole creation shall be
delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the
sons of God. He compares them to a woman in pain ready for delivery; and
that they are delivered from corruption to incorruption at the
resurrection is certain. [See 1 Cor. xv: 42.]</p>

<p>You now understand what I mean by the new birth. It is to pass from
death to life and immortality, in Christ, beyond the grave, where flesh
and blood can never enter. For that which is born of the flesh is flesh,
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.</p>

<p>We have now pointed out the new birth, and shown that it bears some
resemblance to the natural birth, with which Jesus compared it. And how
truly sublime and cheering the thought, that the great family of man, who
are all born into existence under the certain sentence of death, are to
receive a second birth into an existence entirely new, and the whole of
his dying family are to be made the children of Jesus Christ by
adoption.</p>

<p>In our next, we shall notice the change we experience in this life,
called in scripture the new birth, and explain the term, "kingdom of
God."</p>

<h2><a name="sermon9"></a>SERMON IX</h2>

<blockquote>"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee,<br>
 Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."<br>
 John iii. 3.</blockquote>

<p>In our last, we have shown, that the <i>spiritual</i> birth bears some
resemblance to a <i>natural</i> birth with which Jesus compared it--and
as the <i>first</i> introduces us into this world ,so the <i>second</i>
will introduce us into the future and immortal world at the resurrection,
where we shall be as the angels of God in heaven, and "be the
<i>children</i> of God <i>being the children of the resurrection.</i>"
There we shall be completely free from sin and pain. There the gushing
tear of sorrow shall cease to flow, and the brow of disconsolate humanity
be ruffled no more.</p>

<p>We will now attend to the present effects that the truth of this birth
has upon us here, and notice at the same the phrase, "<i>kingdom of
God.</i>"</p>

<p>The question now arises; do not some experience the new birth in this
life? They do. But in what sense do they experience it? Ans. by
<i>faith</i>. In this world we pass from death to life: not that we have
actually been in the grave and brought to life beyond it; but the
believer experiences this by faith. And <i>this faith</i> has a most
powerful and happifying influence on his affections, and consequently on
his life and conduct. All, that God has revealed for the salvation of the
world--our justification, our sanctification, our new birth, our heaven,
our all--yes, all these important and heavenly changes are summed up, and
embraced in our immortal resurrection, will actually take place through
death; and while in this world we can embrace them, <i>only by
faith.</i></p>

<p>The scriptures declare that "we walk by faith and, not by sight." Paul
says, "the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the
Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." Paul knew that he had
eternal life given him in Christ, before the world began, and faith in
that glorious truth produced a happiness--a divine life in his heart,
called the kingdom of God within. Let us notice these several points.</p>

<p>1. First; "Christ rose again for our justification." Our justification
then exists in our resurrection state, and will <i>there</i> in all its
reality take place. But cannot a man he justified <i>here</i>? Yes; he
can be justified <i>through faith</i> in <i>that</i> truth.</p>

<p>2. Second; "By the which will, we are <i>sanctified</i> through the
offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." Our
<i>santification</i> then, by the will of God, will take place through
death. But cannot a man <i>be sanctified</i> while <i>here</i>? Yes; he
can he sanctified <i>through faith</i> in <i>that truth</i>!</p>

<p>3. Third; Christ was "put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the
spirit." So in his resurrection he passed from death to life, and thus
revealed the truth that we shall also pass from death to life by the
power of God, and be like him who is the "first fruits." But cannot a man
pass from death to life while on earth? Yes; he can pass from death to
life <i>through faith</i> in t<i>hat truth</i>. Jesus says--"He that
heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me <i>hath</i> everlasting
life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto
life."</p>

<p>4. Fourth; our eternal life will be realized beyond death. "The things
that are not seen are spiritual and eternal." But can we not enjoy it
<i>here</i>? Yes; "He that believeth on the Son <i>hath</i> everlasting
life;"--that is, he enjoys it faith.</p>

<p>5. Fifth; Christ was the "first born from the dead." So we also shall
pass the reality of the new birth by faith. But can we not enjoy it here?
John says--"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this
is the victory that overcometh world <i>even our faith</i>."</p>

<p>Thus it is evident that a man may in this life be <i>justified,
sanctified</i>, pass from <i>death to life, may enjoy eternal life</i>,
and <i>be born again</i> through faith in <i>these several corresopondent
facts</i>. His faith, however, can make them no more <i>certain</i>;
because they <i>must exist</i>, and be solemn and unalterable facts
before he can be called upon to believe them. The truth of the above
<i>five facts</i>, we perceive, are embraced in our resurrection. If we
are not, in our resurrection, to be <i>justified, sanctified, born
again</i>, and obtain eternal life, then we cannot be j<i>ustified,
sanctified or born again here</i> through faith in those truths;--because
there would be no such truths in existence for us to exercise faith in.
If the objector will not allow these facts unalterably to exist
<i>previous</i> to believing, what then will he call upon us to believe?
Will he call upon us to believe that we have an eternal life in Christ
when no such fact exists, and contend that our believing this lie will
create the fact? This would be the most ridiculous absurdity.</p>

<p>But the truth exists, and the believer by faith enjoys it before hand.
He enjoys it by anticipation, not in <i>reality</i>. It can be brought to
his understanding or experience no other way, only through the gospel
medium of faith. I challenge the objector to show me between the lids of
the new Testament, any regeneration, new birth, justification, or
sanctification, that has already taken place in any other sense than
through faith. All these things in their <i>reality</i> are to take place
in our resurrection, when we shall be like the angels of God and by faith
we bring them present to our minds and enjoy them <i>here</i>. Dr. Watts
says--"Faith brings distant prospects home, Of things a thousand years
ago, Or thousand years to come." Paul, therefore, exhorts us to forget
the things that are behind, and reach forward to those that are
before--to press to the mark &amp;c. because the reality--the object of
our faith lies before us. But persons, who do not understand the
operations of faith on the mind in view of its correspondent truth, and
who honestly believe that the new birth has in reality already taken
place with them, are always looking back to the time they were born
again, and telling over their "old experiences" Now this is right in
them, if they have passed through the <i>reality</i>; for every man ought
to look to the substance in which he exercises faith and hope. But
certainly the scriptures exhort us to look forward, and anchor our faith
and hope within the vail, where our forerunner hath for us entered. It is
therefore certain that the reality exists there, and is yet to come. Such
persons then, in looking back to their experience, are mistaking the
birth produced by faith for the real birth itself. This is just as
unreasonable as it would be to suppose that the foretaste, we sometimes
enjoy of immortal life, was that life itself. It is true we at times
enjoy a heaven on earth. But as it respects the kingdom of immortal
glory, "eye hath not seen, ear heard, neither hath it entered into the
heart of man to conceive the glory that shall be revealed in us." The
reality is therefore yet to come, and by faith we receive only an
antepast of its joys.</p>

<p>From the above observation we infer that, the resurrection is the only
gospel faith and hope of a future, happy conscious state of being. When
our minds are enlightened to see the mighty changes, that we mortals are
represented, in the scriptures of truth, as destined to experience by
being raised in a holy and deathless constitution, we are then led to
consider the resurrection of embracing all those realities that we are
called upon by Jesus Christ and his apostles to embrace by faith and
enjoy in this life. So great and sublime is the gift of God, and so far
surpassing thought does it magnify the perfections of the divine
character, and in so amiable a light does it manifest his love to the
children of men, that a living faith in its reality cannot but obtain a
salutary influence on our life and conversation. So much stress did the
apostles lay upon its importance, that they went every where preaching
the resurrection of the dead, as the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>There is one point we will here notice. All denominations acknowledge
that for any man <i>by faith</i> to pass from death to life is a change
for the better. If so, then the <i>reality</i>, namely to pass from the
sleep of death to an immortal existence, must be a change for the better.
Because it is by believing that future reality we are said to have passed
from death to life here. The conclusion is unavoidable that the
<i>reality</i> must correspond with its antepast <i>by faith</i>. To
understand this let us reverse it. Suppose it should be an established
law in the nature and constitution of things that all mankind should pass
from death to immortal misery in the future world. Let this be revealed
and proclaimed as an unchanging truth. As many as believed it would of
course pass from death to immortal misery in <i>faith</i>, which would
lead them to curse the being who made them, and destined them to this
unhappy end. It would be a change for the worse.</p>

<p>Our subject is now so far plain (according to our views) that the
phrase "<i>kingdom of God</i>" will be readily understood. Though it has,
by different writers, been made to bear many different significations,
yet we shall take the liberty to contend that it simply means as
follows--1. First an immortal existence beyond the grave brought to light
by the resurrection of Christ;--and 2. Second a belief in <i>that
reality</i> is the kingdom of God we here enter and enjoy <i>by
faith</i>. Into this kingdom, infants, idiots and heathen and unbelievers
do not enter, because faith is the only condition. This is the kingdom of
heaven that men, blind leaders of the blind, shut up. They neither enter
themselves, nor suffer those that would enter to go in. They keep the
evidence of the reality out of sight so that men cannot look beyond the
vail to its brighter glories and enjoy its peaceful reign in their hearts
by faith. When faith is lost in certainty, <i>then</i> this kingdom will
be delivered up, and to know shall be life eternal. This definition we
believe will hold good, and apply to any passage in the New Testament
where it may occur. Though some contend that it very seldom has reference
to an immortal existence, yet we strenuously contend that there is no
propriety in the phrase only in connexion with such an existence. We
cannot enter or be born into the kingdom of God by faith, unless we admit
the reality in the first place to have an existence, any more than we
could, by faith, enjoy eternal life unless there is such a reality as
eternal life beyond the grave. The above, the reader will please to fix
in his mind.</p>

<p>We now perceive that man drops into the sleep of death, and that the
resurrection, or new birth is his only hope of a future happy state of
existence, and is the only change that can free him from imperfection,
and sin, and make him a new creature in a new and immortal existence
beyond the grave.</p>

<p>We will here introduce an example to make our argument so far plain.
Suppose you were now in ignorance respecting the doctrine of life and
immortality through a resurrection. You know you must die, and sincerely
think that death will terminate your existence forever. You see your
children one after another laid upon their dying bed, and with
distraction shake the farewell hand of eternal separation, and with the
most solemn melancholy and wo, look forward to the period when you must
follow them down to the chambers of eternal silence, and cease to be.</p>

<p>In this moment of dread solemnity and gloom, suppose some kind angel
should appear at the bed-side of your expiring child, and kindly inquire,
why are you troubled? You answer, because my children have fallen!--the
last of my infant train lies panting for breath, and the dreadful hour
has come when all those silken affections, that build our hearts love,
must be rent assunder, and in the awful bosom of death, be extinguished
forever!--Suppose your guardian angel smiling over the ruins of death,
should point you far beyond these changing scenes, and with rapture
exclaim, you shall meet this darling child again and commingle with your
little fallen flock in glory! You and they and all mankind shall be born
from the dead into the kingdom of God, and be new creatures free from sin
and pain, and "be the children of God being the children of the
resurrection." Jesus your Lord "was the first born from the dead," and
you shall pass from death to life and live forever.</p>

<p>Now suppose you positively believed his words; could you not say in
the scripture form of the expression that through faith you was already
'passed from death to life'?--that you was born of faith, and by faith
was in the kingdom of God? You certainly could, and it would in every
sense of the word be true. Through faith, you would be justified, through
faith sanctified; through faith you would enjoy eternal life--in fine,
through faith you would be saved. This faith would give love unmeasured
to your Creator, and fill your soul with joy unspeakable and full of
glory. "Faith works by love, purifies the heart and overcomes the
world."</p>

<p>Reader, do you not love the Lord for his wonderful goodness to his
children? What glorious hopes are here! "and he that hath this hope in
him purifieth himself even as he is pure"--you now see why the gospel
rings with the word <i>faith</i> from one end to the other.</p>

<p>The world previous to the coming of Jesus Christ had no knowledge of
immortality through a resurrection, into the kingdom of God. The phrase
"<i>born again</i>" is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and of course
means something more than a <i>conversion</i>. This subject will be
continued in our next.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="sermon10"></a>SERMON X</h2>

<blockquote>"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee,<br>
 Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."<br>
 John iii. 3.</blockquote>

<p>The literal rendering of this passage seems to be--"<i>except a man be
born above</i>." The word <i>above</i> being substituted for <i>again</i>
more forcibly demonstrates the correctness of my views in the two former
discourses.</p>

<p>Many charge the Universalists with denying the necessity of a new
birth, or regeneration. But take from me my faith and hope in that
glorious truth, and I must at that moment resign the salvation of every
human being. Convince me that not another child will be born into this
world, and you will at once convince me that this world will shortly be
destitute of a solitary inhabitant. Convince me that a man will not be
born again, and you will not only convince me that no one will ever enter
the kingdom of God, but that the many worlds, that have already passed
from the stage of mortal being, and those that shall hereafter follow,
will alike be consigned to eternal silence! Endless misery is out of the
question. That could have had no existence even had there been no
resurrection in <i>Him</i> who is the life of the world; but death would
have terminated the existence of all. Such a punishment is not threatened
in all the writings of Moses and the prophets. And we cannot reasonably
suppose, if such were a principal truth in revelation, that God would
suffer four thousand years to elapse without warning his creatures of
such an awful doom. Upon our first parents, for transgressing the law, he
pronounced all the miseries of life, and uttered the closing sentence,
"Dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return." Here the doctrine of
endless misery (if that be the sentence of the violated law) ought to
have been clearly stated to the "covenant head" of our race, so that the
same sentence might pass upon all that have sinned, unless they complied
with the conditions set before them.</p>

<p>But we leave this point, and will notice the 5th verse which may,
perhaps, be considered as an objection to my views, and urged as proof
that the new birth is wholly confined to this life. "Except a man be born
of <i>water</i>, and of the spirit," &amp;c. What is here meant by
"<i>water</i>"? Ans. baptism by immersion. This, instead of being an
objection to my views, will strengthen them. Baptism in water is nothing
more than a <i>figure</i> of our death and resurrection, by <i>which</i>
we manifest our <i>faith</i> in the resurrection of the dead, by which
<i>faith</i> our hearts are baptized into the spirit and truth of the
gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>Paul says, I Cor. xv: 29 "Else what shall they do, which are baptized
for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for
the dead?" Baptism being only a <i>figure</i> of our death and
resurrection, is perhaps, in a gospel sense, of but little consequence to
christians in the present day.</p>

<p>Christ went to John and was baptized of him in Jordan. His being put
under water signified his death, when the condemning power of the law
under the first dispensation should lose its force--and his being raised
out of the water signified his resurrection from the cold Jordan of death
to immortal life in the kingdom of God, where the victory shall be sung
over <i>death</i> and <i>sin</i>; and over the <i>law</i> which "is the
strength of sin." Having passed in figure through his own death and
resurrection, and having manifested to man that he was baptized by the
Holy Spirit into the faith and "powers of the world to come," he
perfectly lived up to his obligation, by never committing one sin. He
went through life free from transgression as though he were already in
eternity. When his crucifixion hour approached, he said, [Luke xii: 50,]
"I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened"
[Greek--<i>pained</i>] "till it be accomplished." Here he had reference
to his being buried in death, (which was to be attended with extreme
sufferings) and rising again from it, which would be the <i>reality</i>
of which his baptism in Jordan was but a <i>figure</i>.</p>

<p>To be put under water signifies our <i>death</i>, and to be raised out
again signifies our <i>resurrection</i>. A person, who is baptized, ought
therefore, to endeavor, as much as in him lies, to live as though he were
already in his resurrection state. Enjoying in faith the baptism of the
"Holy Spirit and of fire," he ought to consider himself as dead to the
world and alive to God walking in newness of life.</p>

<p>Let us introduce Rom. vi. 3, 4. "Know ye not that so many of us as
were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into <i>his death</i>?
"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death; that like as
Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we
also should walk in newness of life." Here we perceive they were baptized
into his death, and were rejoicing in hope of the <i>resurrection</i>,
having their hearts purified faith in the reality, Acts xxii. 16 And now
why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins,
&amp;c. Now, it is not only a scripture doctrine, but all denominations
acknowledge, that baptism in water is an <i>emblem</i> of the washing
away of our sins. We then ask--are our sins to be wished in a stream of
water? No. Where then? The objector says, our sins are taken away <i>in
this life</i> by the baptism of the "Holy Spirit and with fire." This
cannot be; because Paul told the believers that if there were no
resurrection, their faith was vain, and they were <i>yet in their
sins</i>. [See I. Cor. xv. 17.] This proves that believers receive the
forgiveness of their sins in this life <i>by faith only</i>, not in
<i>reality</i>.</p>

<p>The question returns, are our sins washed away in a stream of water?
No. Where then? Ans. Through death and the resurrection, for that is the
real baptism. And it is certain that the <i>reality</i> must embrace all
that the <i>figure</i> in water teaches. We then solemnly ask the
reader,--if baptism in water is a <i>figure</i> of our death and
resurrection, and if <i>that water baptism</i> signifies the washing away
of our sins, will not then our sins be washed away through death and the
resurrection? Yes; otherwise the figure in water has no meaning.</p>

<p>Thus we perceive that being born of the water is no objection to our
views of the new birth, but affords them an unshaken support. If any one
contend that the sins of our race are not to he taken away through death,
we would then ask, where will the christian's sins be washed away? The
scriptures declare that there is not a just man upon earth that doeth
good and sinneth not,--and if there is no change through death then there
will not be a just man beyond the grave that doeth good and sinneth not.
But the baptism "with the Holy Spirit and with fire" in all its solemn
and interesting reality will take place in death and the resurrection,
and to exercise a living faith in that truth, so as to influence our life
and conduct according to the spirit of the gospel, is what the scriptures
term being baptized with the spirit and with fire in this life. But this
present enjoyment is not the <i>reality</i>, but an antepast of <i>that
reality</i>; because "we walk by faith and not by sight." It is
immaterial whether the scripture speaks of <i>pardon</i>, of
j<i>ustification</i>; of <i>sanctification</i>, of <i>redemption</i>, of
<i>regeneration</i>, or <i>baptism</i> "with the Holy Spirit and with
fire," it simply means that those facts in the divine counsels
unchangeably exist, and will burst upon the whole groaning creation in
the resurrection world, while the believer only enjoys them in this state
of being through faith, which baptizes him into the spirit of Christ. But
if there be no resurrection, and nought is presented to our anticipation
but the dreary prospect of a beamless eternity, then "preaching is vain,"
"faith is also vain," "christians are yet in their sins," "and they that
are fallen asleep in Christ are perished."</p>

<p>The taking away the sin of the world by the Lamb of God, who is the
resurrection and the life, is through death. Through death, to our faith
and hope, he has destroyed "him who hath the power of death, that is the
devil." The washing away of all sin, by the power of God, is through
death and the resurrection. <i>Then</i> and not till <i>then</i> shall
the song of triumph be sung by redeemed millions--"0 death! where is thy
sting? 0 grave! where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the
strength of sin is the law", &amp;c.</p>

<p>All the figures of baptism point to <i>death</i>--all the sacrifices
for sin, slain under the law for 4000 years, point to death, declaring
that without the shedding of blood there is no remission. There the
reality lies. There we are called upon to anchor our faith and hope even
within the veil. And it must be a <i>certain truth</i> that our sins are
to be washed away through the Jordan of death, before we can he called
upon to believe it. It must be a <i>certain reality</i> that sin is there
to be purged away, before we could, with any propriety, use baptism in
water as a shadow of it; bcause the <i>shadow</i> cannot create the
<i>substance</i>.</p>

<p>We have now shown that as man is naturally born into this world, so he
shall be spiritually born into the kingdom of God. We have shown by
comparison that except a man be born of a woman, he cannot see this
world; and as this does not mean that he must be born twenty days before
he comes forth from the womb, as a preparation for entering this world,
so the expression, "except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom
of God," does not mean that he must be born twenty days before death as a
preparation for entering a future existence. The new birth, no more means
a <i>reality</i> that is to transpire <i>here</i>, than natural birth
means some change we underwent prior to our being brought forth into
life.</p>

<p>I believe in all the reformation or new birth <i>here</i> that others
do, and believe in much more to come. That change <i>here</i>, which they
call the new birth, I call the new birth in faith, or being born of
faith, while the solemn reality is yet to transpire, and that is to he
born from the dead in Christ our head. These facts we will now make plain
to every reader by the following example, so that our views on this
subject may not be misrepresented.</p>

<p>Suppose that before we were born, we had been able to conceive ideas.
And suppose it had been spoken to us by the Son of God--except you are
born of the flesh, you cannot see the natural world, which is most
beautiful to to behold, having sun, moon, and stars, and songsters,
fields and groves. It has never entered your heart to conceive the glory
to he revealed in you. Now suppose some of us had believed this
revelation, we would that moment, have been born of faith, and rejoiced
in hope of the glory to be revealed in us; and by faith have looked
forward to the reality. This, however, would not have made our birth any
more certain, because it must have been an absolute truth before we could
have, with any propriety, believed it. Suppose, further, that some of us
had rejected it; would this circumstance have prevented our being born?
Certainly not. All of us, who believed, would have been born of faith,
having an earnest of the reality, and the unbelievers would have come
short of that enjoyment by faith; but their unbelief could in no sense
make the truth of none effect. The moment we were born, belief and
unbelief would be lost in certainty.</p>

<p>Now suppose that some of us had said--the Son of God has declared
"except we are born of the flesh, we cannot see the natural world." This
must mean some great change we are to experience in the womb--we must be
born some number of days before we enter the natural world, as a
preparation, otherwise we can never see it.</p>

<p>We now ask the reader, whether it would not be folly to give to the
word <i>birth</i> such an explanation? The Conclusion is unavoidable. We
then ask, whether it does not involve the same folly to contend, in view
of our text, ("except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God") that it means, he must be born again in this world, as a
preparation for another? It certainly does.</p>

<p>We once more repeat it--that as natural birth was the <i>very
thing</i> that introduced us all into this world of imperfection, sorrow
and pain; so the spiritual birth will be the <i>very thing</i>, that
shall introduce us all into <i>another</i>, where, imperfection, sorrow
and pain shall be no more.</p>

<p>The poor heathen, and infants, and all, will therefore be born again
into the kingdom of God, and "be equal unto the angels, die no more, and
be the children of God, "<i>being the children of the resurrection</i>."
The only advantage we enjoy above them is, that we have heard the good
news, believed it, are "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever," and
"have entered into rest." We are rejoicing in hope of the glory of God to
be revealed in us, while they are groping in darkness, inasmuch, as they
cannot believe in him of whom they have not heard.</p>

<p>In our next, we shall close this subject by urging the importance of
the new birth through faith in the truth.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="sermon11"></a>SERMON XI</h2>

<blockquote>"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee,<br>
 Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."<br>
 John iii. 3.</blockquote>

<p>In our last three discourses we have endeavoured to lay our views of
the new birth thus far plainly before the reader, and wish him to bear in
mind that the three sermons, preceding those on the new birth, are also
to be read, and carefully kept in view, so that, from the whole
connexion, the gospel doctrine of salvation by <i>faith</i> may be made
clear to his understanding. We dwelt so long, and laid so much stress
upon <i>faith</i>, because it is the <i>first</i> christian grace, we are
exhorted to put on, and is the <i>first</i> assent of the mind to the
great and interesting <i>truth</i> revealed in the gospel of Jesus
Christ, which is <i>life</i> and <i>immortality</i> for the human
family.</p>

<p>We have shown that the new birth has a higher signification than
simply to be converted from the evil of our doings, as was required under
the first dispensation. The new birth, so far as it concerns the present
existence, embraces not only <i>conversion</i>, but the whole spiritual
<i>life</i> of the christian's soul, denominated the kingdom of heaven
within. This mental felicity--this "weight of glory," cannot be enjoyed,
but by the exercise of a living faith in Christ. Such a faith begets a
sincere obedience in our life and conversation. It is a faith "that works
by love, purifies the heart and overcomes the world." The great apostle
to the Gentiles exclaims--"the life that I now live in the flesh, I live
by the <i>faith</i> of Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
We therefore "walk by <i>faith</i>, not by <i>sight</i>."</p>

<p>We have shown that Christ was the "<i>first born</i> from the dead" to
show light to the people and to the Gentiles, and that the whole creation
is groaning in travail-pains, and that it shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God,
and that we shall then be as the angels of God in heaven. We have shown
that all mankind--infants, idiots and heathen, shall be brought to
realize this birth, and that the believer, only, can only enjoy it in
this state of existence through <i>faith</i> in the truth, and that this
<i>faith</i> has a most powerful influence on his life and conversation,
"being born of incorruptible seed by the word of God that liveth and
abideth forever." We have shown that neither this birth, nor any of the
spiritual changes, can be experienced in this life only through
<i>faith</i> in their correspondent truths, even as they are revealed to
us in the gospel of Christ. We have shown that by the phrase, "kingdom of
heaven" we were to understand, <i>first</i>, a holy, happy and immortal
existence beyond the grave," incorruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not
away, reserved for us in heaven," and which, with all its perfections and
joys, was revealed to us by Jesus Christ; and <i>second</i>, a sincere
and living <i>faith</i> in this interesting <i>reality</i>, produced that
divine enjoyment, called "the kingdom of heaven within us," the kingdom
of heaven among men, &amp;c. This kingdom the Pharisees "shut up"--they
"neither entered it themselves, nor suffered those that were entering to
go in." That is--they prevented the people from <i>believing</i> those
interesting <i>realities</i>--those sublime doctrines of a future world
that their Messiah had brought to light through the gospel for the
present happiness of men.</p>

<p>We have shown that water baptism is but a <i>figure</i>, a
<i>shadow</i> of our death and resurrection, or of the washing of
regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, and that this figure is of
but little consequence to us in this present day. In fine we have shown
that if there were no future existence--if nought were held up to man but
the dreary prospect of a beamless eternity, he could not be justified,
sanctified, born again, pass from death to life or enter the kingdom of
God through faith, because in such case the <i>objects</i> of his
<i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i> would be annihilated, his faith would be
vain, he would be yet in his sins. In this view of our subject, we
perceive that Christ is but "the author and finisher of our faith,"
having been ordained of God "to bring life and immortality to light," to
set us an example for our imitation and happiness here below--and to die
and rise in attestation of the truth involved in his mission.
Consequently his kingdom will be delivered up when <i>faith</i> and
<i>hope</i> shall be lost in certainty and joy.</p>

<p>It now remains that we urge the importance of the <i>new birth</i>
through faith in the truth. And here we shall probably meet with one
objection from the reader, viz. As we argued in sermons, No. 5, 6, and 7,
that faith was the first exercise of the creature, and that no one could
<i>believe</i> or <i>disbelieve</i> what he pleased, the reader may then
ask, what necessity is there of urging the importance of the new birth
through faith in the truth, in as much as faith cannot be exercised at
the <i>pleasure</i> or simply at the <i>will</i> of man? And here we
would remark--that the guilt of unbelief does not consist in rejecting a
fact after patient investigation, by collecting all the evidences in our
reach, but it consists in rejecting a fact without examination of its
truth. For instance; let the gospel be preached to a heathen, who rejects
it without attempting to acquaint himself with the evidences upon which
its truth is based. He is condemned for not believing, because he
neglects the only means by which he might be convinced of the truth. He
declines searching for evidence. Of the truth of this remark we have a
striking instance in the scriptures. Paul preached at Thessalonica, but
they heeded not his words. He preached also at Berea, and the inspired
penman says, "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
scriptures daily whether these things were so." It is our duty to search
the scriptures prayerfully and "labor to enter into that rest that
remains to the people of God, lest any of us through unbelief should seem
to come short of it." It is our duty to search for evidence of the fact,
at least on all subjects relating to our present happiness, and
particularly those that appertain to the future world. They are too
momentous to be treated with indifference.</p>

<p>There is nothing more important than that we should exercise a living
<i>faith</i> in a future and happy existence beyond the grave. This alone
can afford the mind "joy unspeakable and full of glory." There is in
every human bosom an unceasing uneasiness, an aching void that nothing on
earth can satisfy or fill. Old and young, ignorant and learned, heathen
and christian feel the same dissatisfaction with the objects of momentary
duration. The heathen, in the midst of all his self-denials and
self-tortures to appease his gods, and in the conscientious discharge of
all his devotional duties, is still a dissatisfied and miserable being.
God has so constituted the human mind that it cannot repose in error,
however sincere may be the faith it exercises. There is still a growing
vacuum within that nothing but the powers of truth can fill. Philosophy
has endeavoured to search out that system of moral duties, in the rigid
performance of which, that happiness, peace and joy might be found, for
which all mortal beings pant with the same aspirations of strong desire,
but has sought in vain. From the earliest ages, one system after another
has been invented, and in succession abandoned, but all have come short
of discovering any thing solid on which to rest their hopes of earthly
felicity.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, the author and finisher of our faith, has alone
accomplished what all the penetration of Pythagoras and all the moral
lessons of Seneca and Socrates failed to discover. With a bold, firm and
untrembling hand he has drawn aside the curtains of the tomb, and pointed
the human family to a second birth from the dark womb of death into
mansions of incorruptible felicity in the kingdom of God, where they
shall die no more, and where all the inquietudes, appertaining to this
fleeing existence, shall be unknown. This future state of being, he has
not only revealed, but has demonstrated its certainty by those
incontestable evidences, which can never be shaken by all the powers of
infidelity combined. He has burst the icy bands of death and risen
triumphant beyond its solemn shade, and begot in us those lively hopes,
those fond desires, that ease the aching heart--that communicate unbroken
peace amidst the various ills of life, and afford it divine consolation
and joy in the trying moment of death. In those interesting truths the
believer confides, and in every condition in life is enabled to rejoice
in the hope that when "this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, he has a
building of God, a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens." In
this faith, man's countless wants are satisfied, inasmuch as God has
secured his dearest interest. In this faith the believer is entered into
rest, is born of God, and is translated into his kingdom. He <i>knows</i>
that by faith he has passed from death unto life, for his soul is filled
with love to God and man. This love, this divine enjoyment, is the
natural effect of <i>faith</i>, inasmuch as it works by love, purifies
the heart and overcomes, the world. He is not only at rest respecting
himself, but at rest respecting his children and dear friends, whom he
may be called to follow to the land of silence and the shadow of death.
He stands at their dying bed and whispers to them consolation, in the
joyful assurance, that he shall meet them again beyond the dominion of
death and pain in the regions of glory. His bosom is the mansion of those
pure and holy affections and of those sublime hopes, that none can know
but those who are thus born into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>Reader, you must die. How important then that you should faithfully
and prayerfully examine the scriptures so that tormenting fears,
distraction and despair may not in that solemn moment rend the peace of
your bosom to atoms. A sweet peace and composure of soul in that trying
hour, are of incalculable worth. It is enough to struggle with physical
pain without the addition of mental woes, which present neglect, and your
ignorance of the truth and consolations of the gospel of Christ, are sure
to bring upon you. Perhaps you are a father, and may be called to stand
at the death-bed of a beloved child. That child may call upon you as a
parent to administer consolation to its departing spirit. He clings to
life, or ardently desires to live forever in the mansions of rest beyond
the grave. But what consolation can you impart, if you are yourself
ignorant of the doctrines of the gospel of Christ? The heart-rending
prospect of endless wo, or the gloomy horrors of annihilation, could
afford no consolation to that mind, which has the principles of glory
deeply rooted in its nature and which nothing but the continuance of
existence can rationally satisfy. As you value unbroken peace in the hour
of dissolution, and as you value the happiness of these dear pledges
heaven has lent you, study for the evidence of christian truth, search
the scriptures, and labor to enter into that rest that remains here to
the believing people of God, who are born again and <i>specially</i>
saved through <i>faith</i> in the truth.</p>

<p>This labor is not only important in view of the solemn hour of death,
but important in view of the life you here live in the flesh. Happiness
is the ultimate pursuit of all mortal beings. They vainly imagine that it
can be found in riches, honors and titles--yes, even imagine that it can
be found in the hard ways of the transgressor. Though sensible that
worlds before them have failed, and gone down to the grave with the pangs
of disappointed hope, yet man is so strangely inconsistent as still to
believe, that these earthly pursuits contain some hidden charm which he
flatters himself he shall find even though all before him have failed.
Here is the delusion, kind reader, of which you are cautioned to beware.
There is no happiness but in the path where the hand of mercy has sown
it--no happiness but in the objects where God has placed it. It is no
where to be found but in the enjoyment of the religion of Christ. This
will sweeten every earthly pursuit, make every burden light, afford solid
enjoyment in life and divine consolation in the hour of death. Flatter
not yourself that there is any happiness beneath the sun aside from this.
"There is no peace saith my God to the wicked," and, he who says there
is, contradicts Jehovah, and is yet "in the gall of bitterness and in the
bond of iniquity." A speculative faith is of but little consequence, so
long as it does not influence our life and conversation for the better.
We must believe to the saving of the soul from the evil of the world.
"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy righteousness
shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward."</p>

<h2><a name="sermon12"></a>SERMON XII</h2>

<blockquote>"A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,<br>
 and loving favor rather than silver and gold."<br>
Prov. xxii: 1.</blockquote>

<p>A good name involves all that can render man exalted and amiable, or
life desirable. The good opinion of mankind has, in all ages, been
considered as a blessing of the first magnitude, and has, in various
ways, been sought for by all. There is no man so dishonest, but what
labors to impress upon others the conviction of his honesty; no man so
deceptive, but what wishes to be considered sincere; nor cowardly, but
desires to be reputed brave; and no man is so abandonedly vicious, but
what desires to be considered virtuous by his fellow creatures. All
choose a good name in preference to a bad one. This being a fact the
appearance of virtue is kept up where the reality is wanting, and the
shadow is often mistaken for the substance.</p>

<p>There are many, that are, at heart, insincere and false, who pass in
society generally for persons of sincerity, candor and virtue, while
their real principles are known only in their own families and among
their confidential friends. They desire a good name and outwardly
maintain it, while they in reality but little deserve it. In order to
know what a man really is, we must be acquainted, not only with his
public, but his private character. In his own family, every man appears
what he really is. There the heart, word and action art in unison. They
embrace each other. In public, they too often separate; and the word, or
action, speaks what its divorced companion, the heart does not feel.</p>

<p>Such not only literally choose, but often bear a good name. But this
is not the choice suggested by the text. All men, even the most vicious,
in some sense or other, choose a good name. But the passage under
consideration has a higher, a nobler aim, than a mere choice unconnected
with virtuous principle and action. It has a higher aim, than to
encourage men to he rotten at heart, and by an outward, hypocritical
maneuver, maintain a good name among their fellow creatures. By the text,
we are to understand, that a man should early cultivate, in his heart, a
virtuous principle, as the pure source from which all those outward
actions spring that justly merit the esteem of mankind, force approbation
even from the vicious, and thus entitle him to that good name which is
far above all price. This will not only afford its possessor unbroken
peace arising from the inward consolations and joys of virtuous
sincerity, but it will also open to him another rich fountain of
felicity, arising from the consideration, that he enjoys the confidence
and esteem of the great and the good, with whom he is conversant in life,
of his intimate friends, of his companion and children, and above all the
smiles of kind heaven and the approbation of his God. His life is calm;
his sleep is sweet and associated with golden dreams. No fearful spectres
haunt his brain, but the kind angel of mercy is ever at his side. He
looks forward to death undismayed, yes, with satisfaction and composure
looks beyond that dark scene, to brighter worlds and more substantial
joys. He feels the assurance, that even when he shall be here no more,
his name shall live in the hearts of those he left behind, be embalmed in
the memory of the just, and that it is beyond the power of rolling ages
to sully it. This is what we understand by choosing a good name as stated
in our text.</p>

<p>Of the truth of this, there can arise no misapprehension when we
compare it with the subsequent phrase with which it is contrasted--"a
good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favor than
silver and gold." By the choosing of riches, we are to understand, not
only a desire to obtain them, but that this desire shall be sufficiently
strong to prompt us to use all the honorable and efficient means in our
power to accumulate them. The wise man did not mean that every man had
the offer of a fortune, and could possess himself of it by simply making
choice of it independent of means.--No--his choice must be manifested by
industry and economy. The means must be used to secure the end. Just so
in acquiring a good name. The person desirous of obtaining it, must
pursue that upright and virtuous course of conduct, which alone could
insure it. And just as well might a man expect riches by being indolent
and extravagant, as to expect a good name by indulging in every species
of vice. We are therefore to understand our text thus--A good name,
through pursuing a virtuous course of conduct, is rather to be chosen
than great riches, through the plans and means by which they are
obtained.</p>

<p>Man is a being of many wants, and to supply them he is too much
inclined to forsake the path of virtue and resort to dishonorable means
to obtain wealth.</p>

<p>In view of this master-passion for earthly splendor and greatness,
Solomon uttered the words of our text to recall the giddy mind from its
chase of shadows, sad turn it to the only source of unmingled felicity in
the pursuit of virtue. This would afford the mind those rational delights
that wealth, with all its dazzling splendors, cannot impart. It does not
possess the charm to convey unbroken peace to the heart.</p>

<p>But there is a strong inducement to engage in a virtuous course,
because it is the surest road to wealth and honor. The thief and robber
were never rich, nor nor could they be happy if they were. An excellent
writer, observes--the importance of a good character in the commerce of
life, seems to be universally acknowledged. To those who are to make
their own way either to wealth or honors, a good character is as
necessary as address and ability. Though human nature is often
degenerate, and corrupts itself by many inventions, yet it usually
retains to the last an esteem for excellence. But even if we arrive at
such an extreme degree of depravity as to have lost our native reverence
for virtue, yet a regard to our own interest and safety will lead us to
apply for aid, in all important transactions, to men whose integrity is
unimpeached. When we choose an assistant or a partner, our first inquiry
is concerning his character. When we have occasion for a counsellor, an
attorney, or a physician, whatever we may be ourselves, we always choose
to trust our property and lives to men of the best character. When we fix
on the tradesman, who is to supply us with necessaries, we are we are
influenced by fair reputation and honorable dealing. Young men,
therefore, whose characters are yet unfixed, and who consequently may
render them just such as they wish, ought to pay great attention to the
first steps they take on entrance into life. They are usually careless
and inattentive to this object. They pursue their own plans with ardor,
and neglect the opinions which others entertain of them. By some
thoughtless action or expression, they suffer a mark to be impressed upon
them, which no subsequent merit can entirely erase. Every man will find
some persons who, though they are not professed enemies, yet view him
with an eye of envy, and who would gladly revive any tale to which truth
has given the slightest foundation.</p>

<p>Though a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and is
the surest road to wealth, yet there are thousands, who pay but little
attention to possess themselves of so valuable a treasure. They turn a
deaf ear to that hallowed voice, which pleads with them in behalf of
their dearest interest, and take the downward road to dissipation and
vice, and, by their wretched example, lead other thousands to the dark
abodes of sorrow, grief and pain. Enchanted by the siren voice of false
and fleeting pleasure, they hurry to the tremendous precipice, where
reputation and fortune lie in broken ruins. There they drag out a
wretched existence in disappointed hope, satiety and disgust. They pay
their devotions at the shrine of ignominy, where the dark and stagnant
waters of guilt and condemnation roll. There the sweet voice of
heaven-born peace was never heard, and the beauteous feet of religion
never trod. There dwells the family of pain--there is the hell we are
cautioned to avoid. This is not an illusion of fancy--it is no reverie of
the brain, but a reality too visible in the pathway of human life.</p>

<p>Thousands, in this condition, are hurrying to a premature grave, and
go down to that dark abode covered with infamy, having robbed themselves
of all the substantial joys, that a virtuous conduct, and a good
unsullied name are calculated to awaken in the heart. Dissipation darkens
the brightest prospects of life. It rolls its floods of misery
indiscriminately over the dearest earthly hopes of companions, children
and friends, and paralizes every pulse of joy that beats in the human
bosom. Many a child has been spurned from the presence of its brutal
father, and been beaten for asking bread to satisfy its hunger.
Intemperance stupefies man to the moral impressions of the gospel, and
hardens the heart with the touch of its benumbing powers. It is the giant
of human wo that slays his thousands and prostrates the happiness of man.
This champion of human war draws his sword of vengeance against the balmy
repose of public and private life, and his fatal touch withers the
brightest flowers of domestic hope and joy, and mingles the poisonous
bowl with the bitter drugs of misery. His government is absolute
monarchy, and his subjects the most contemptible slaves. When he lays
upon them his cursed hand, they reel to the ground. When he strikes the
stunning blow, they drop insensibly to the earth. The oppressions and
scourges of the most wretched slave are enviable in comparison with those
severe wounds inflicted by this merciless tyrant, this infernal scourge
of the human race. Intemperance is a monster that may well be
personified. He frolicks through the blood, preys upon the vitals,
ploughs up the brain, dethrones reason and laughs at the feeble
resistance of the best constitution, and finally bears down all
opposition before him. Like the devouring flame, he presses on with
irresistible force, urging his deadly siege, till he consumes all that is
fair and lovely in the eye of virtue. His present gifts are poverty
misery and distress, and his capital prize, a premature grave.</p>

<p>This champion is ravaging our beloved country, and seducing her sons
of freedom to the disgraceful ranks of slavery and oppression.
Intemperance is that tyrant that has under his control many formidable
evils that infest the world. His boasted labor is to hurry on thousands
of victims to the commission of crime, and bring down upon them the many
misfortunes that attend man in this mutable world. Intemperance involves
public broils, tumults and disturbances, and domestic discord, misery and
strife.</p>

<p>We trust the number among our readers is small, who are so regardless
of a good name as to have abandoned themselves to the intoxicating bowl,
or who have sundered all the ties of moral obligation, determined to
tread the downward path of vice to a disgraceful tomb. We hope they have
a higher regard to the invaluable worth of a good name; and we pray that
they may venerate its price far above the momentary glitter of silver and
gold. That shall live, when wealth shall have lost its lustre, and
flourish immortal, when gold shall have corroded to dust.</p>

<p>Blasphemy is another unreasonable vice against which the public
speaker or writer should raise his voice. And let no one flatter himself
because we believe in the universal and unbounded goodness of God, that a
man may go on as he please. So long as a Being of infinite wisdom is
enthroned in the heavens and governs the universe, so long he can never
fail to measure out to every offence its adequate punishment, and has all
the means at his disposal to bring it unavoidably upon the head of every
transgressor. He, who flatters himself that he can sin with impunity, is
ignorant of the government of his God, and has never reflected upon human
life in all its varied lights and shades. Do you profess to be a
Universalist, and yet treat with irreverence the name of HIM who made
you, and whom you acknowledge to be a faithful Creator--an indulgent
Father? Your professions are nothing. "He that hath this hope in him
purifieth himself even as he is pure." That very breath by which he
inflates the lungs, can you breathe it back in blasphemies against his
holy name, which angels never pronounce but with veneration and awe?
Choose, 0 choose a good name, which can only be obtained by choosing a
virtuous course of conduct. However lightly you may treat your own
station in life, or however much you may disregard the dignity of your
nature, yet remember the station you hold, however obscure, is stamped
with responsibility. You are surrounded by a generation of youth, among
whom are your own children, ready to imitate your example. Do you wish
them well! Then guard your heart and life by setting a reasonable value
on a good name, and remember you cannot move without touching some string
that may vibrate long after your head rests on its cold pillow of
earth.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon13"></a>SERMON XIII</h2>

<blockquote>"A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,<br>
 and loving favor rather than silver and gold."<br>
Prov. xxii: 1.</blockquote>

<p>In this discourse we shall more fully show why "a good name is rather
to be chosen than great riches."</p>

<p>Though wealth is desirable, and in many instances conducive to human
happiness, because it puts it in our power to relieve the wants and
distresses of our fellow creatures, yet it does not possess the charm to
convey unbroken peace or solid joy to any bosom. The value, of anything
within the range of human action, is to be estimated by its usefulness in
promoting the happiness of man. That, which pours the most numerous and
refined enjoyments into the soul, is to be considered of the greatest
worth; and that, which has a tendency to bring upon us the most alarming
miseries, misfortunes and woes, is of course the most worthless. The one
is to be fondly chosen and pursued in proportion to its worth in
administering to our enjoyments, and the other is to be avoided in
proportion to its unhappy effects in multiplying our sorrows. This being
an undeniable fact, the superlative value of a good name, procured by a
virtuous course of conduct, appears, at once, to transcend all other
considerations: A pure unsullied conscience before heaven is the most
permanent bliss that a rational being can enjoy, and is of that enduring
nature which no earthly power or misfortune can destroy. It supports us
in the hour of adversity and trial; it comforts us in the dark hour of
sorrow; it remains unmoved amids the storms of life, and lights up the
smile of satisfaction on the lips of the dying.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. It affords us other unruffled streams of unmingled
felicity in the common intercourse of life. The approbation of the wise
and the good, the confidence and esteem of our friends and associates,
and the good opinion even of the vicious, are considerations of no
ordinary moment. They awaken emotions in the heart of the most pleasing
gratification, and open in the soul all the avenues of heaven-born
felicity, imparting that peace, which this world can neither give nor
take away. But as it respects <i>wealth</i>, we would remark, that though
it may communicate happiness by enabling us to relieve the wants of our
fellow creatures, and afford us many joys in the indulgence of our
benevolence, yet it cannot of itself communicate happiness, but virtue
can. A wicked and unprincipled man is wretched, though he roll in all the
wealth and splendors that earth can give. He feels in his bosom a
<i>burning flame</i>, that all the streams of wealth can never quench,
and a <i>craving desire</i>, that nought on earth can gratify. If his
"great riches" afford him any enjoyments, yet these are by no means
permanent and lasting. The desolating flame may lay them in ruins--the
storms on the ocean may sink them in its waves--the famine or blighting
mildew may wither them forever, and leave him stript of all his fancied
joys. But nothing of this can happen to virtue. That remains forever
unharmed amidst the shocks of earth. A good name is,therefore, of
inconceivably more value than riches and rather to be chosen than silver
and gold.</p>

<p>We are formed for society. God in beginning said, "it is not good that
man should be alone." This being a fact, which all past experience, and
the history of our whole race demonstrate, it is, therefore, equally
true, that our dearest enjoyments flow from the social affections and
from a sincere cultivation of the social intercourse of life. There is,
perhaps, not a human being in existence, who would accept of all the
wealth of the Indies on the condition that he should not be respected by
a single individual on earth. This circumstance shows us, in noonday
light, the superior value of a good name above all the glittering
appendages of wealth. Every man is beloved and esteemed in proportion to
his goodness and usefulness in the world, particularly by those with whom
he associate in life. If then to <i>love</i> and <i>be beloved</i> depend
on our conduct in the world, and if at the same time, our happiness is
derived from the exercise of reciprocal affection, we see the importance
of pitching upon that course of life, which alone can secure those solid
pleasures resulting from a well spent life.</p>

<p>Too many persons suppose, they can be happy in sin; yes, even in
criminal indulgence. But that transgressor was never yet found, who could
point to a single wicked act in his life, the remembrance of which ever
imparted one solitary gleam of joy to his heart. They may fancy there is
happiness in sin; but here is the deception. It is immaterial what some
may preach about <i>the pleasures of sin</i>, and <i>the satisfaction the
transgressor often takes in a wicked course</i>, yet all this amounts to
nothing so long as the voice of heaven declares, "THERE IS NO PEACE,
SAITH MY GOD, TO THE WICKED." Infinite wisdom <i>must know</i>, and
infinite wisdom, <i>has given</i> the decision, and that decision is
stamped with immortality, and from it there is no appeal. If we impress
the sinner with the idea that he is not punished and rewarded
<i>here</i>, but that the whole is to be settled in the future world,
then we, in the same proportion, <i>weaken</i> the force of virtue and
<i>strengthen</i> the cause of vice. And this is one obvious reason, why
men continue in sin, as long as they dare, expecting at some future day
to repent and escape <i>all punishment</i>. They go on from day to day,
and from year to year, with all the thunders of endless and immortal pain
sounded in their ears, and even believing it true, yet continue to
indulge in sin. Would they run such an awful risk, unless, by a certain
course of education, they had been made to believe that there was
happiness in transgression? No. If they believed that sin had nought to
impart but misery, they would abandon it for its <i>own sake;</i> because
happiness is the object of all men. They have, therefore, by some means
or other, been led to the strange infatuation, that sin possesses some
secret charm to communicate that happiness to the soul, for which every
bosom throbs. This fancied happiness, they vainly imagine, they can
obtain by wallowing in the dark waters of iniquity, be happy <i>here,</i>
then repent at last, and be happy <i>hereafter.</i> As they pass along in
their wretched career, expecting every moment to grasp the fancied
pleasure, yet the fond, anticipated phantom flies from their embrace and
leaves them in the ruin of their joy. Though disappointed again and
again, yet firmly believing that there is happiness in sin, they again
push on, and thus far attribute their want of success to some
miscalculation. Insensible of the nature of sin, blinded and
self-deceived, they go on in pursuit of pleasure, while golden dreams of
false felicity fire their imaginations, till at last, age places them on
the verge of the grave; their object no nearer attained than it was the
day they set out, while habit has fixed them in a course, that has
yielded them nothing but sorrow and pain, and vanity and vexation of
spirit. Stung with remorse, and pierced through with many sorrows, they
breathe a repentance, which, the nature of their condition, forces upon
them, are perhaps pronounced <i>converted,</i> and they sink into the
darkness of death! Their names, covered with infamy, are soon blotted
from the remembrance of the living!</p>

<p>We observed, a moment ago, that the idea, of holding up a retribution
in the future world, weakens the force of virtue, and strengthens the
cause of vice. This has, perhaps, been abundantly shown in the arguments
already offered as being manifest in the daily conduct of men; yet we
will, in a word, bring the subject plainly before you. To persuade a
sinner that he is to be punished in the <i>future</i> world for his sins
in <i>this,</i> is plainly saying that sin has many pleasures and
conveniences <i>here,</i> and so far as it failed of rendering him his
due desert, the balance is to be made up in another state of being.
Because the balance of punishment due him <i>there,</i> is to make up the
<i>deficiency</i> of punishment, which sin did not pay him <i>here.</i>
And certainly, so far as sin did not pay him <i>here,</i> he must have
been happy in its commission. And the <i>expectation,</i> that he should
be happy in it <i>here,</i> was the <i>very cause</i> that induced him to
continue in transgression, with the expectation of repenting and escaping
punishment <i>hereafter.</i> Thus he flattered himself, that he could sin
with impunity, and escape its punishment in this world and the world to
come.</p>

<p>And to satisfy a man that he is to be rewarded in the <i>future</i>
world for his righteousness in <i>this</i> but persuading him, that
virtue is attended with misery, and that so far as it failed to reward
<i>here,</i> the balance is to be made up <i>hereafter</i>. Because the
balance of happiness due to him <i>there,</i> is to make up the
deficiency of happiness which virtue did not pay him <i>here.</i> And so
far as virtue did not pay him here, must have been miserable in its
practice. And the impression that sin is productive of many enjoyments,
and that righteousness is attended with misery, has a tendency to make
him choose the <i>former</i> and reject the <i>latter,</i> and trust to a
future repentance.</p>

<p>We often hear it proclaimed by those, who profess to be the guardians
of the public morals, that the righteous have a hard course in warring
against the corruptions of their heart, in the service of God, while the
sinner goes on unconcerned and easy in the pleasures of sin. In doing
this they defeat the very object, they are striving to obtain, which is
the <i>conversion</i> of the sinner. These very impressions are one
obvious reason why so many continue in sin and reject the path of
righteousness and peace, which alone conducts to a good name, that is of
more worth than great riches, and more durable than silver and gold.</p>

<p>As then there is no happiness in vice, as all its allurements are
deceptive and vain, how important that we should shun it, and pursue that
bright path of virtue and peace, which will lead to the invaluable
possession of a good name. Engaging in the cultivation of all the better
affections of the heart, we shall by habit so refine our natures, that
"loving favor" will take entire possession of our minds, and mould them
into the spotless image of heaven. <i>This</i> loving favor is rather to
be chosen than silver and gold, for these will corrupt, and at last
crumble into dust, while <i>this</i> shall survive the ruins of death,
and flourish in those peaceful realms, where our felicity will be
unbroken and perpetual.</p>

<p>Flatter not yourselves with the vain hope, that there is one solitary
thrill of joy in the indulgence of sin. He, who indulges in dissipation
and vice--he, who slanders his neighbor, who wrongs his fellow men, or
even utters one oath against the unsullied name of his Maker, is a most
profound unbeliever in the sentiment we proclaim. He, who possesses a
hope so full of immortality as to believe, that God will finally save
from sin, and bless him and all his fellow men, will cleanse his hands
and wash them in innocency. Tell me not that you are a Universalist, when
the very oceans of God's goodness do not affect your heart, nor lead you
to repentance. He, who is satisfied that there is no happiness in sin,
will abandon it. He, who deliberately pursues a vicious course, expects
to find happiness in it; and it is impossible that he believes in God's
<i>universal grace.</i> It is absolutely impossible in the very nature of
things, that he can be a UNIVERSALIST. A salvation from sin is the
doctrine of the Bible, and holiness itself heaven. He, who believes such
a salvation to be happifying, will abandon sin, as the enemy of his
peace, and seek righteousness, which alone can afford him tranquillity.
Jesus says, the kingdom of heaven is righteousness and peace. If you wish
to satisfy men that you <i>really</i> desire the whole human family to
meet in heaven, then show your sincerity by being righteous yourself.</p>

<p>A sincere Universalist believes sin to be the cause of many mental
woes that darken the world, and the principal cause of the greater
proportion of sufferings that fall to the lot of man. He believes that a
virtuous course of conduct, guided by the burning lamp of revelation,
leads to those joys that time cannot sully, nor the hand of death
extinguish. A conviction of this truth leads him to hate sin, to forsake
its dark dominions, and enter those fields of felicity, where the
brilliant beams of virtue shed a cloudless day. Here he walks and enjoys
an antepast of heaven. Its paths are the paths of peace. All its ways are
pleasantness and delight. Its crystal streams are pure and sweet; its
breezes healthful and its fruits delicious. He believes God to be the
father of his creatures--that he governs the world in wisdom and
mercy--that he created with a benevolent intention, and that he is not
disappointed in the workmanship of his hand, but presides over just such
a world as he designed it should be. He believes that this order of
things, though dark to him, is designed for good, and shall terminate in
the happiness of all. He believes that all rewards and punishments are
instituted for some benevolent end, and that this end, will be brought
about in such a manner as to manifest to all, the divine perfections in
the clearest light, and shed unfading glory on the supreme Majesty of
heaven. This faith gives him confidence in his heavenly Father, and fills
his heart with gratitude and veneration. It leads him to look upon the
human family as his brethren, and to do them good. He seeks their
happiness, and thus chooses and merits a good name.</p>

<p>At peace with all mankind, his mind irradiated with light and enlarged
with the most noble conceptions of the divine character and government,
he at length lies down in peace and composure upon his dying bed, and
gently breathes out--</p>

<pre>
"Farewell conflicting joys and fears,
  Where light and shade alternate dwell;
 A brigter, purer scene appears,
  Farewell inconstant world, farewell"!
</pre>

<p>He sweetly sinks to rest, and leaves behind him a good name, that can
never die, and an example, for others to imitate, worth more than
fortunes in gold. His memory shall survive, when the tomb, on which it is
inscribed, shall crumble into ruin, and his example be a light to future
generations.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon14"></a>SERMON XIV</h2>

<blockquote>"Be of the same mind one towards another. Mind not<br>
high things, but condescend to men of low estate."<br>
Romans xii. 16.</blockquote>

<p>That mysterious and incomprehensible Being, who gave us existence, has
sown in our nature the seeds of mortality. By the irresistible
<i>laws</i> of his empire which he has, from the beginning,
<i>established</i> for the regulating of the animal creation, we are soon
to be carried to the silent grave. All, without exception, are formed out
of equal clay, are subject to the same hopes and fears, joys and sorrows
while on earth, and are all destined to the slumbers of death, where we
must exhibit the emblem of perfect equality. Immaterial how far one may
exalt himself above another while passing through this momentary
existence--immaterial how far he may rise above his fellow men in the
scale of intellect and refinement--immaterial how exalted the station he
may have obtained--how brilliant the powers of his imagination may
sparkle, or how soft and sublime his eloquence may flow--immaterial how
nobly soever he may dazzle in the sunny smiles of fortune, or how secure
he may repose in the fond embrace of friends, yet it is a melancholy
truth, that he must, sooner or later, resign the whole, let go his eager
grasp on all those pleasing joys, bid an everlasting farewell to those
exalted splendors, and descend to the dark shades of death, where the
rich and the poor, the servant and his master, the oppressor and
oppressed, all lie mouldering and forgotten together.</p>

<p>This solemn consideration, it seems, when forcibly presented to the
mind, ought to be sufficient to check the levity of man--to soften his
bosom to his fellow beings--to moderate his desire in pursuit of wealth
and greatness, and completely to unarm him of all hostile feelings
towards those with whom be associates, and with whom he is so soon to lie
down in death. This, it seems, is sufficient to make us of one heart and
mind in promoting each other's happiness and welfare in the world, and to
make us obedient to the exhortation of the text, not to mind the high
things of earth, but to condescend to men of low estate. But such is the
strange infatuation of man, that he acts as though his residence on earth
were eternal, and as though the whole errand of life consisted in
providing for an eternity below.</p>

<p>We are capacitated for enjoyments of a higher and more perfect nature
than we can attain to on earth. Of this we are sensible from the fact,
that there is no condition in which we can be placed here below, that is
so adapted to our nature as to afford us permanent satisfaction.
Uninterrupted felicity is not a plant of earth. It cannot flourish in a
clime where the blighting storms of malice and envy wither all that is
fair, sweet and blooming. And though we are sensible that such is the
fact, yet, deaf to all that experience, example and observation conspire
to teach, we are exerting all our powers to obtain it here below, where
the united voice of earth and heaven assure us it cannot be found. We
cast our eyes around us, and see the human family in every varied
condition of life from the beggar on his bed of straw, up to the king in
regal splendor on the throne of nations; but in defiance of this immense
distinction, they alike breathe the deep sigh of discontent. We also cast
our eyes over the historic page, and scan the general fate of man in
by-gone ages; but here too, we learn the same lesson, that no <i>external
condition</i> has ever added to the rational enjoyments of the soul. We
see the same uneasiness, the same longing desires pervade every bosom.
Our object is happiness; and amidst all the various pursuits of life,
what is the reason so many fail of obtaining it? The answer is readily
given. We make riches, honors and the high things of the earth our chief
pursuit and aim, and fondly imagine that our happiness lies in them. Here
is our error. Man is destined to a world of mental felicity, where those
external pursuits of fortune will be unknown; where all that he here
pursues with so much eagerness will be removed from his desires forever,
and where all the channels of the soul will be opened to the true
fountain of felicity and completely ravished in its flowing streams. In
order, therefore, to enjoy that happiness, in this momentary state of
being, which God has placed within our reach, we must make mental felcity
the main pursuit of life, and the riches and conveniences of earth our
secondary pursuit. We must completely reverse our conduct in order to
obtain those rational enjoyments, that flow from the virtuous habits and
dispositions. We must, as Jesus says, "seek first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you."</p>

<p>Food and raiment are all that we can enjoy of the external comforts of
life. All other enjoyments must be of a mental character. Secure first
your mental joys, a pure unsullied conscience in the punctual discharge
of all your social and relative duties to mankind, and be you rich or
poor, you will be happy. The righteous discharge of this first great duty
will not embarrass you in obtaining the comforts of life, but on the
contrary aid you. A peaceable and honest course of conduct towards
others--a condescension to men of low estate--a due respect for the
opinions and rights of others, will endear you to all, and not only
foster in your bosom the seeds of peace and contentment, but will conduct
you in the surest path to wealth and honor. The mental powers of the soul
are all that exalt our capacity for happiness above a brutal creation.
And if our chief happiness lies in gold, which can only minister to our
animal wants, then the brutes can vie with us in all the solid enjoyments
of life. In fact, they can go beyond us. They graze the turf, and drink
the unmingled stream free from anxiety and care. While man, the lord of
this lower creation, has to toil and gain the same enjoyments by the
sweat of his brow.</p>

<p>But what a groveling thought to bring our exalted natures and
capacities for happiness down to a level with theirs! On this principle,
he who is the most wealthy is the most happy. Virtue is but a name, and
all the exalted principles of noble and godlike action are but the
reveries of fancy, and to practice them is but a visionary dream. No, my
friends, wealth supplies our animal wants, and if virtue be wanting, it
leaves our minds in wretched starvation and our brightest joys in night!
Happiness is equally attainable by the rich and the poor. It consists in
a union of heart among mankind, in a union of action in the pursuit of
virtue, and in the kindlier feelings of our nature. In fine, it consists
in a willing obedience to the exhortations of our text: "Be of the same
mind one towards another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of
low estate."</p>

<p>To each of these exhortations, we will give a candid and solemn
consideration. In this sermon, we will attend to the exhortation--<i>"Be
of the same mind one towards another."</i> By this, we are not to
understand that men are to be of one heart and mind in pursuing the same
occupation or profession in life, but of one mind in endeavoring to
promote each other's happiness in every condition in which they may be
placed--of one mind in the practice of christian duty, and in the
exercise of charity. Selfishness produces many jarring interests among
mankind, bursts the bands of brotherhood asunder, and weakens the
strength of that nation, society or family among which it exists, and in
proportion to the opposition it produces among its individual members.
"United, we stand,divided we fall," is a maxim full of wisdom, and is not
only applicable to nations, but to communities, societies, and even to
families.</p>

<p>A family in discord is a sight over which angels might weep, but when
united in one heart and mind, it is a picture over which heaven smiles.
The fond and doating father, the tender and affectionate mother, and
obedient children, all united in peace and harmony, present to the mind
those pleasing conceptions of the reconciled family immortal, that cause
us to feel all the burning emotions of which the heart is susceptible. In
such society as this, are enjoyed the happiest moments of our
existence--moments unmingled with the bitterness of regret, unsullied by
the corroding hand of time, unruffled by the perplexing cares of life,
and undarkened by the tempests of indisposition. Is such a father
absent--far distant on land or ocean where duty calls? The heart of his
family goes with him, and he too leaves his heart lingering behind. His
companion counts the moments as they slowly roll--is faithful to his
interests--makes preparation to receive him--sighs for his safe return,
and welcomes him home with those emotions of ecstatic joy, that cause him
to forget his past labors, toils and dangers. Is he stretched upon a bed
of pain? Unwearied she sits beside him, hushes every sound that might
interrupt his broken slumbers, and watches every breath he draws. She
whispers to him the soothing words of encouragement and
consolation--gives neither sleep to her eyes, nor slumber to her eyelids,
but is the guardian angel of his pillow.</p>

<p>When all human aid has failed--when the pulse beats faint--the once
sparkling eye grows dim and rolls faint and languid in its socket, she
stands mute and pensive at his dying bed. Her whole soul is absorbed in
the interest of the scene and rent with agony. She wipes the cold sweat
of death from his face, gazes with exquisite anxiety till the last
dreadlful struggle is over, and breathes to the throne of mercy the
prayer of affection for the repose of his spirit. And so feels the kind
husband over his companion, indulgent parents over their dying children,
and dutiful children over their parents.</p>

<p>But it is a lamentable circumstance, a painful consideration, that
there are too many unhappy divisions in the domestic circle. Yes, it is a
painful consideration indeed, that those, who are so nearly allied to
each other, should, even for one moment, indulge in feelings of acrimony.
It is but a short time, at longest, that we can be together, and such
unhappy divisions must render the parting scene, at the bed of death,
doubly painful. Thoughtless, giddy or oppressive as we may be to those,
who are near to us in life, while blooming health is their lot, yet
righteous heaven has so constituted our natures, that the most painful
reminiscences will force themselves upon the mind when the injured
object, to whom we have given distress, is upon a dying bed. Every unkind
word, every harsh treatment, the whole dark picture our ungenerous
conduct will present itself to the imagination in all its naked woes. And
be that dying one a parent, a companion, a child, their very silence, as
thy turn upon us a languid eye fading in death, will harrow up every
painful recollection. 0! if we wish to tread upon their graves with an
unsullied conscience before heaven, let us be of one mind, live in peace,
and discharge, to them, those sacred duties of kindness and affection,
which the ties, that bind them to us, enjoin.</p>

<p>This world is too much made up of appearances. Many a family, which we
suppose to be the abode of union, peace and joy, is distracted with the
voice of discord, and is dragging out an existence in secret, concealed
grief. Many a husband and wife, who, we suppose, are of one heart and
mind and passing their days in the sunshine of peace and love, are torn
by secret broils, and whose mansion stands overcast with the dark shadows
of discontent and misery. Little do we dream of the secret woes, that
rend many a worthy heart concealed behind a smiling countenance. The
husband is perhaps stern and unrelenting--and will, in no case, yield to
the wishes of his companion. Discouragement and anger may perhaps at
times take possession of the heart. In such a case, instead of treating
her kindly, he rouses into a passion himself, and a private contention
ensues. This is a wretched practice, for instead of extinguishing the
flame, it adds fuel to the fire, and consumes all that is fair and lovely
in matrimonial and domestic life. Much misery might be avoided by
observing the following rule. When the one is melancholy, let the other
be rationally cheerful, and endeavor to divert the attention from the
subject that causes gloom. When the one is angry, let the other keep a
perfect equanimity and a benign composure of countenance. Then watch the
opportunity, and in some future day, when the offended one is most
cheerful and kind, then bring forward the subject, and expostulate most
feelingly on the impropriety of indulging a wrathful spirit to a bosom
friend. Speak of the shortness of life and point each other to the silent
grave and to the parting scene, and vengeance, anger and discontent will
soon be strangers in your habitation. Your dear children, from the very
dawnings of intellect, will take the example, grow up in harmony and
affection with perfect rule over their spirit, and thus you will not only
secure your own domestic peace, but will bequeath those sacred enjoyments
to your posterity--enjoyments that infinitely outweigh a thousand
fortunes in gold! Let others toil to leave their offspring wealth, we
ours the joy to bequeath them this. We ask no more.</p>

<p>We are not only to be of the same mind one towards another in our
families but in our religious societies. Here all selfishness ought to be
discarded, all private interests sacrificed, all hostile feelings
subdued, and the whole offered on the altar of genuine good, and thus the
harmony, peace and prosperity of the whole body consulted. The permanent
security of these depend on the individual conduct of the members. By
uniting ourselves in a religious body, we express the necessity of living
a sober life, maintaining a union of heart and a respectful conversation
towards all with whom we associate in life. Let us not dream that heaven
will prosper us above others, if we also blaspheme the name of Him who
gave us life and sustains us in being. Let us lay aside every evil, that
has a tendency to disunion, and live soberly and righteously in the
world, doing good unto all as we have opportunity.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon15"></a>SERMON XV</h2>

<blockquote>"Be of the same mind one towards another. Mind not<br>
high things, but condescend to men of low estate."<br>
Romans xii. 16.</blockquote>

<p>Having from the commencement of these sermons confined myself to
prescribed limits, I had no room in my last to pursue the first division
of my subject so far as I intended. I will therefore here resume it.</p>

<p><i>"Be of the same mind, one towards another."</i> We have thus far
confined our attention to family union, and have just glanced at the
necessity of union in religious societies. This is a day of inquiry and
light when the most keen and searching glances are sent into every creed.
Many denominations that have walked together heart and hand for many
years, each repelling the assaults of those, who attempted to extinguish
their ism, have at length been separated by internal divisions and formed
two opposing parties, even though they once believed the <i>same
creed,</i> and advocated the <i>same church government.</i> The present
is a trying period, and it stands us in hand to endeavor to "keep the
unity of the spirit in the bonds of peace." Let us not dream of religious
union, and prosperity, unless we allow each one to think for himself in
matters of scripture interpretation. Nor let us dream of prosperity, if
there is among us more theory than practice. It is true, Universalists
are as moral as any other denomination; but this is not enough. They
ought in <i>kindness</i> and <i>benevolence</i> to transcend other
denominations as far, as their doctrine of universal beniguity transcends
the doctrine of unending wo.</p>

<p>Neither are we to dream of religious union and prosperity, unless we
raise our united voices against those who revel over the flowing cup of
intoxication, which pours so many streams of misery and disunion on the
world. Let no one fancy to himself that the drunkards toast, <i>"here is
health and success to us!"</i> has any charm to avert his ruin, or to
stay the judgment of heaven. The more frequently that toast has been
uttered, while smiling upon the cup of inebriation held in a trembling
hand, the farther have health and success been removed from the deluded
victim, and the more swift and deadly have misfortune, sickness, distress
and pain fallen upon him. Intemperance is a demon, that sows the seeds of
discord among all ranks, orders and conditions of men. Beneath his
crushing hand creation reels, and fortunes fall in broken ruins! And
peace the sweet angel of mercy flies these turbulent skies, and lights on
realms unmoved by the hand of commotion and discord. At his approach,
blooming health is driven back from its warm abode and the fairest
flowers of domestic love, hope and joy are withered forever! Let this
frightful foe of discord and confusion be barred from our sacred heritage
and peace be within our borders.</p>

<p>We are not only to be of one heart and one mind in resisting profanity
and intemperance, but in resisting tale-bearing. Let us not speak evil of
others. This is beneath the character of a gentleman, and certainly
beneath that of a christian: consequently no gentleman or christian will
indulge in it. It is the employment of <i>low, ill-bred minds,</i> and
therefore none will engage in it, but those who are destitute of
reputation themselves. This vice has no excuse, and must therefore
originate in the <i>basest</i> motives. They intend to bring their fellow
creatures down to a level with themselves, and thus lessen them in the
good opinion of others, and destroy their peace. And though they may
effect their object so far as the good opinion of the virtuous is
calculated to give us happiness, yet the approbation of a good
conscience, arising from the conviction of innocency, can never he rooted
from the heart of its possessor by all the calumnies of earth.
<i>This</i> God has secured in all the secret chambers of the soul, and
forever barred it against the breath of slander. There he takes up his
abode and holds communion with the contrite spirit. The real merits and
consolations of virtue are secured to its possessor by the impartial
legislation of righteous heaven. Intemperance in its effects, compared
with slandering, is harmless; at least so far as producing discord is
concerned. The peaceable drunkard, compared even with that church member,
who is continually sowing discord in society, is an angel. Slander is but
the infectious breath or a foul spirit, that poisons the healthful
atmosphere wherever it is breathed, and breaks the quiet repose--the calm
serenity of neighborhoods and families, as it were, with an electric
shock.</p>

<p>Political slander is as infectious and destructive to the harmony of
the nation, and the security of our government, as private slander is to
neighborhoods and societies. No sooner is a candidate held up for office,
than all the party dogs of war on both sides are let loose and set to
barking. Immaterial how fair may be his character, how inviolable his
veracity, or how unsullied his honor and integrity, they will make him
appear to be an outcast from society, covered with the darkest blots of
infamy. Immaterial how great may be his qualifications, or how splendid
his talents, they will, by that species of logic for which slanderers are
famous, prove him to be a fool. These dissentions do not expire when the
candidates are elected. They are carried to the capitol of our common
country and blown out in more than wordy war. There, we have reason to
fear, the volcano is gathering, and that the day is not distant when it
will disembogue in more than the thunders of Etna, wrap our political
heavens in a blaze, and melt its elements with fervent heat. Anarchy and
confusion will seize the reins of government, and drive us to the
oblivious shades of departed empires. If we continue to go on in our
political slanders as a nation, losing sight of our common welfare, and
sacrificing the <i>general,</i> on the altar of <i>partial</i> interest,
the day of our ruin is not remote. Its awful morn, has, already, it
seems, dawned with streaks of malignant <i>light,</i> and (like ill fated
Troy) ominous of the purple streams, the crimson blood, that watered the
Trojan plains where mighty Sarpedon fell, where Hector lay slain by the
sword of Achilles. Heaven forbid that our national sun, that rose so
fair, should go down in blood, and shroud our temple of Liberty in
everlasting night! To avert such a catastrophe let us reform, and do our
duty as individuals. The safety of any body politic depends on the
conduct of the individuals that compose it. And God grant that these
dissentions may cease, that political peace and harmony may become
perfect, and our government may stand immoveable on its basis, like the
rock that remains unshaken by the furious storms that agitate the ocean.
May we, as a nation, be of one mind in resisting every species of
immorality, in studying the happiness of our fellow creatures--of one
mind in obtaining a knowledge of the character of our Creator, in
studying his parental and benign government, and his divine attributes
and unchanging perfections--and be of one mind in acquainting ourselves
with his beautiful works that swarm around us and afford us so many
rational delights. Let us store our minds with useful knowledge, practice
the precept of Christ, labor for mental emancipation, and contentment and
peace will be our lot.</p>

<p>In the great duties of religious obligation, let us be of one heart
and mind. Let us live like brethren, not only among ourselves, but among
other denominations. It is not long that we are to be together. We are
fading like the flower of the field, and ought to bear in mind that death
will soon lay our heads equally low in the dust, and the worms shall
cover us. We glitter for a moment like the bubbles borne on the bosom of
the ocean; they break and mingle again with the parent fountain. We toil
and heap up wealth, pass like empty shadows over the plain and vanish
forever! Generations, that covered the earth, are gone, and unremembered
by the living. They strove to gather wealth and honors--they met each
other in the hostile field--rolled garments in blood, bedewed the widow's
and the orphan's cheek with tears, and filled their peaceful habitations
with the voice of lamentation and wo. Thousands lived in clamors and
discord, and one seemed destined to be oppressed by another. But the
fields of war are still, the noise of battle is hushed, and the voice of
lamentation and wo is heard no more! Hark! All is still as the chambers
of eternal silence! Where are they? In the shades of death! Kind reader,
this is the doom of us all! And so it will soon be said of you and me!
Let us then be of one mind. Let us do good by visiting the fatherless in
their affliction and keeping ourselves unspotted from the world.</p>

<p>We have now considered the fact, that real felicity consists in mental
pleasures and gratifications, and that these alone exalt our nature and
capacity for happiness above the brute creation, and have directed your
attention to virtue and peace as the only condition in which that
happiness can be found. We have brought to view the propriety of being of
one heart and mind towards each other in our families, in our religious
societies, in the community and in our national concerns. We have set
before you the evils resulting from intemperance, and from private and
political slander.</p>

<p>We will now, in the <i>second</i> place, take into consideration the
<i>negative</i> and <i>affirmative</i> consequence resulting from them on
the morals of the community so far as the causes leading to
<i>intemperance</i> and <i>crime</i> are concerned.</p>

<p>Many discourses have been delivered, during the three past years, on
intemperance pointing out its ruinous effects on the morals of society,
while but few discourses have been put into the hands of the public
pointing out the causes leading to this destructful vice, and those few
have not in my humble opinion traced it to its <i>true source.</i> Much
has also been said about intemperance leading to crime, which in many
respects is true. But all this is not coming to the fountainhead from
whence these turbid streams flow. We will take the liberty to differ on
this subject with all that has as yet fallen upon our ear, and
independently give our opinion, as to what we conceive to be the original
cause from whence these baneful effects spring. We will endeavor to show
that <i>the poorer class of society are driven to intemperance and crime
by the conduct of the rich (those whom the fashion of the world calls
respectable and great) yes, by the conduct of too many, who are even
attempting to reform them.</i></p>

<p>First, then we would remark; that man is a creature of want, which is
the first cause of all action. Had he no wants, he would never seek to
supply them, either by <i>honorable</i> or <i>dishonorable</i> means. To
this self-evident proposition, all will without hesitation assent. We
will now attend to our general character as a nation, for it will be
admitted, on all hands, that actions speak louder than words. As a
nation, we enjoy much liberty; but public opinion, either of a political
or religious character, may become so popular as to erect itself into an
engine of oppression, and so formidable, that many an honest man dare not
dissent, nor independently raise his voice in defence of what he believes
to be truth, but will tamely submit himself a slave to the opinions and
doctrines of others. This is probably the case with the greater
proportion of the American people.</p>

<p>Again, though we profess to value every man by his integrity or moral
worth, yet it is a fact, that in conduct we make a man's reputation
depend principally on his purse. I yield the point without controversy
that in books, in news-papers, in preaching and in words, we profess to
esteem a man and rate his standing in society by his integrity. But what
do words and books, and news-papers and preaching amount to, while
mankind in conduct practice right the contrary of all these ostentatious
professions? They amount to nothing but hypocrisy, or ridiculous
nonsense. Does a man's standing, in these days, depend on his conduct! By
no means. Let us introduce an example. Suppose there were two individuals
of equal talents, and both possessed an equal education. Their moral
characters are the same. But one of them falls in possession of an
immense fortune, while the other is poor indeed. Now will public conduct
place them on an equality? No. Will they both move in the same social
circle? No. Will they both be treated with the same politeness and
attention by their neighbors? No. Should they propose a public measure
for the good of the town, would the one be listened to, with the same
attention as the other? No. Would he possess so much influence in
society? No. Well, what can be assigned as the reason, why this rich man
stands so far above the other in the public opinion? Ans. It is because
his character is measured by the length of his purse, and the weight of
his influence is determined by the weight of his gold.</p>

<p>It is not a thing of rare occurrence, that the rich are thus
distinguished from the poor, but it is a fact so notorious that it has
long since passed into a proverb. This being the course of conduct which
men practice, the impression has therefore become general that
reputation, influence and power depend on wealth. Hence the great
inquiry, uppermost in every mind, is "how shall I get rich, so that I may
stand high in the estimation of men, and exert a powerful influence in
society, and be numbered among those who move in the higher circles of
life?" Concluded in our next.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="sermon16"></a>SERMON XVI</h2>

<blockquote>"Be of the same mind one towards another. Mind not<br>
high things, but condescend to men of low estate."<br>
Romans xii. 16.</blockquote>

<p>Even a man, who is in many things unprincipled, if he is at the same
time wealthy, takes a station in the higher circles of life, where the
poor, but honest man, would not be admitted. This course of conduct is
not only practised by what are called men of the world, but by professors
of religion of about all denominations, by both preachers and people.</p>

<p>The middling, and the poor class, seeing no encouragement, or even
possibility, of rising so as to associate with those, who move in the
higher circles of life, by any virtuous conduct they may pursue, and
sensible that wealth alone possesses the charm to give them virtue and
notice in the world, they are thus driven to various, dishonorable means
to obtain it. Multitudes are driven to the crimes of counterfeiting,
theft, and even robbery and piracy. They commence their wretched course,
with the intention to abandon it, as soon as a competent fortune is
obtained. Other thousands are driven to gambling; and even those, who are
called respectable, take every possible advantage in trade and
bargaining. Their pursuits are various, but their object is one and the
same--viz: to gain wealth, so that they may obtain a high standing and
influence in society. Thousands thus driven into crime, are detected,
lose their reputation, and abandon themselves to intemperance. Their evil
example has a pernicious influence on the morals of those children and
youth, who may, by various circumstances, be placed in their society, and
thus the pestilence, in all its frightful horrors, gathers force and
spreads.</p>

<p>There are thousands of virtuous persons, whom poverty excludes from
the higher ranks of life, who are doomed to seek the converse of those,
who are in a measure corrupted, and, by associating with them on public
occasions, often in taverns and alehouses, are soon involved in habits of
dissipation and obscenity. Man is a social being, loves society, and,
rather than spend his life in solitude, will seek the converse of the
vicious.</p>

<p>If we would obey the injunction of the text--"Mind not high things,
but condescend to men of low estate," these evils would be in a great
measure removed. If we, as a community, would strip away the fancied
reputation, which wealth attaches to the human character, and,
independent of property, place every man on an equal footing, according
to their moral and mental worth, and let their power and influence in
society, be according to their conduct, it would give a noble tone to
public feeling and moral grandeur.</p>

<p>By the "<i>high things,</i>" mentioned in our text, we are to
understand that vain popularity which one man wishes to enjoy above
another, in a religious or political sense. It is one of the ruling
passions of the day,in which we live, to be considered of high standing
among our fellow creatures, and to possess a larger share of influence
over the minds and opinions of men, than those whom we consider our
rivals. Those, who possess this desire, and at the same time feel a
haughty spirit towards those, whom they consider in the humble walks of
life, are certainly not the men, who are entitled to our esteem, nor are
they to be looked up to, as examples of magnanimity. So far from
possessing true greatness of soul, or being entitled to veneration, they
are certainly below those whom they affect to despise. A truly great and
good man has no desire to dazzle, but to be useful in the world. He sees
the miseries under which thousands groan, and desires to relieve them,
but with no wish to be considered great for discharging those duties of
kindness and humanity. But it is a lamentable consideration, that too
many, in performing those acts of mercy, seek to stand on an eminence
above the crowd they wish to benefit, and proclaim their intentions to
men through the loud sounding trumpet of fame, but, at the same time,
will not even stoop to converse with the very beings they profess such a
warm desire to aid. Every thing must be done on a high scale, and in the
manner they dictate, otherwise they have no wish it should be done at
all. It is a matter of regret, that this spirit, so desirous of minding
high things, has been carried into the sanctuary--in fact, has been
carried to the solemn gates of death--yes, even into eternity.</p>

<p>We have witnessed what are commonly called "revivals of religion," in
which two or more denominations united, apparently, heart and hand. They
publicly declared, that as they saw their fellow creatures exposed to the
burning wrath of God in the future world, they had no motive in view, but
their conversion and escape from that awful doom--that it was, to them, a
matter of indifference with what church they united themselves, provided,
they would only repent and turn to God. All this passed on well till the
reformation ceased. The next thing, to be determined, was, what doctrine
do you believe, and what church will you join? This was a trying point,
and its settlement filled them with animosity towards each other. And
why? Because each desired the honor of converting them to their faith,
and of bringing them into their church, or else, that they should not be
converted at all. Though this has been done by some, yet it is no
evidence, that all will do this, or even approve it. There are those,
who, we believe, are actuated by nobler motives than in the cause of
truth, and who are not aspiring to stand high, nor striving "who shall be
greatest." One denomination has labored to assume the entire honor of
reforming the public morals--has labored to become incorporated by an act
of Legislature into an American Temperance Society, and were unwilling to
admit Universalists and Unitarians to co-operate with them in this work
of reform. This is but aspiring after high things, instead of manifesting
the meek and lowly spirit of Christ.</p>

<p>But we would more particularly remark that, it is this very course of
conduct of any man, or class of men exalting themselves above others in
account of their <i>wealth</i>, or <i>external circumstances</i>, that
discourages the poor, who are not only called, but treated as the lower
order of society, and drives thousands of them to the intoxicating cup,
as a relief from the mortifications of poverty, and drives other
thousands into crime, as the only means to obtain that wealth by the
omnipotence of which, they alone can rise to eminence, respectability,
and influence among men. Preachers of the gospel, as well as others, give
sanction by their conduct to these false notions of respectability and
greatness. They will seek the society, and court the favor of the rich in
preference to the poor, even though the <i>latter</i> may exceed the
<i>former</i> in integrity and moral worth. This, we say, is the most
powerful incentive to drive men into a state of encouragement,
intemperance and crime. It is a fearful precipice on which we stand, as a
religious community. Instead of estimating a man's standing by his
virtuous principles, it is too much estimated by his dollars.</p>

<p>So did not Jesus Christ our great example. He mingled with the lowest
class of society. He associated with, and visited most among those he
wished to reform, so that his meek, mild and heavenly example might exert
a salutary influence upon their hearts, and cast a restraint upon their
conduct. He was a friend to publicans and sinners, and ate and drank with
them. He went among them, as a physician, to give them life and health,
to conduct them by encouragement and persuasion to the paths of
righteousness and peace. His presence was not needed among those who were
whole. He was of course seldom found in their society. He did not desire
to rank with the rich, self-righteous pharisee. So ought those, who
profess to be the servants of Christ, to go among them, who are most in
need of their aid. "The servant is not above his Master." They ought,
therefore, to condescend to men of low estate, and visit the abodes of
poverty and want.</p>

<p>But instead of this, they stand aloof, even from the respectable,
because they are poor, and instead of visiting those, who indulge in
dissipation and vice, and trying to lead them to the paths of virtue and
peace, are heaping upon them the most opprobrious epithets. By esteeming
the rich and associating with them, they practice a course of conduct,
which has rooted the impression deep in every mind, that to be esteemed,
and to rank with them in the social circle, they must be rich. This has
driven many a virtuous man into crime, many into bad company, and finally
into discouragement and intoxication. This no one can deny. What, we ask,
is the reason, that there is so large a proportion of the middle and
lower class of society, compared with the rich, who indulge in
<i>crimes</i> and <i>intemperance?</i> Why is it when misfortune falls
upon the rich, that they, so often, resort to the intoxicating draught?
The mystery can only be unriddled in the stubborn fact, that wealth, more
than virtue, gives a man a reputation in the world, and this destructive
vice involves thousands in ruin.</p>

<p>If every man were assured that, be he <i>rich</i> or <i>poor</i>, he
could associate with those who are wealthy and respected, and move in the
higher ranks of life, if he only maintained his integrity, and that he
would be esteemed in proportion to his moral virtues and mental
acquirements, every man would be induced to merit a good name; and their
good opinion would operate as a constant check upon his conduct. Every
man, by early attention to his deportment, can become respectable, but
every man cannot become wealthy.</p>

<p>Did the rich esteem the poor, and admit them into their social circle
<i>solely</i> on the ground of moral worth, there would be but little
danger of these poor ever forfeiting their standing, by plunging into the
floods of intemperance and crime. And did they reject from their circle
the <i>rich</i>, who were vicious until reformed--in fine, did they only
strip away from wealth its fancied charm, to make them either
respectable, or influential, did they confine it to its due limits, as
being only necessary to satisfy our animal wants, and did they with one
consent declare that an improved mind and virtuous worth should be the
only criterion by which men should take their stations in social life,
intemperance and crime would soon cease. Men would then be as much
engaged in striving to merit a fair reputation, as they are how in
striving to obtain wealth. It is, therefore, the conduct of the great by
falsely attaching character and influence to wealth, that is driving
their fellow creatures into crimes to obtain it, and other thousands into
discouragement and intemperance. From this charge preachers are not
exempt. They too respect, and visit the rich more than the poor, and thus
indirectly lend their influence to drive them from virtuous life to a
course of dissipation and crime. And when once they get them there, then
they wish to devise some <i>great means</i> to bring them back to the
paths of sobriety and virtue. Do they endeavor to effect this, by ceasing
to mind high things, and by condescending to men of low estate? No--but
instead of going among them, and taking this unhappy class of our fellow
creatures by the hand, and leading them by encouragement and persuasion
to the paths of temperance and reformation, they have, in substance,
said, "stand by thyself, I am holier than thou." They have minded high
things, by placing themselves on an elevation above them, and made them
out to be worse than murderers, thieves and robbers, by ascribing all the
crimes, that are committed, to the use of rum! This has discouraged and
exasperated many, and made them feel that reformation would be of no
avail to raise them to be the associates of those, who appeared so
anxious to reform them. Their language has, in substance, been--you must
reform, give us the credit, but must stand where you are in the lower
circles of life, obey our exhortations, and look up to us as your
benefactors, but you cannot expect to rank with us, because you have
<i>no cash</i> to introduce yourselves into our circles. And as all men
desire society, they have remained with their companions in iniquity.</p>

<p>For any class of society to take a station above others, and endeavor
to force men to abandon the cup by passing votes or enacting by-laws,
that no spirits shall be sold them, is but exciting their rage, and
causing the intemperate to drink the more out of revenge, and causing
those, that are already temperate, to increase the quantity as an act of
defiance. It is a fearful precipice on which we stand as a religious
community. Estimating a man's standing in society by his immense wealth,
or learned profession, rather than by his integrity and virtue, is
attended with the most dangerous circumstances, as we have already
noticed. Men cannot be reformed by force, nor by declaiming what a low,
mean, unworthy, degraded part of the human race they are.</p>

<p>There is too much pride in our world. We ought to bear in mind that
death will soon lay our heads equally low in the dust, and "the worms
shall cover us!" 0 the folly of human pretensions to greatness! Let us
not mind high things, but condescend to men of low estate. By preachers
and people of all denominations obeying the exhortations of our text,
mankind would, in a great measure, be restrained from crime, and
certainly from being openly intemperate. If then, we sincerely desire to
reform them, and to hold a powerful check upon their conduct, and prove
ourselves the benefactors of our race, let us begin the work, by adhering
most scrupulously to our text, which exhorts us to be of the same mind
one towards another, to mind not high things, but to condescend to men of
low estate.</p>

<p>It is the duty of preachers, in particular, to be meek and lowly in
spirit--to be humble and watch over the moral maladies of mankind--to
break down the arrogant distinctions, which the fashions and riches of
the world have set up--to esteem men purely for their moral and
intellectual worth, independent of the gifts of fortune, and to visit
those, who are given to intemperance, and, by gentle persuasive measures,
endeavor to lead them to habits of sobriety. And when this is effected,
treat them according to that respect, which their virtues merit. God is
kind to the evil and to the unthankful, and ought we to be unkind to
them? Heaven forbid.</p>

<p>We have now set before you, what we conceive to be the <i>principal
cause</i> leading to <i>intemperance, dishonesty</i>, and <i>crime.</i>
True, there may be some exceptions to this, but we are conscious, that it
is the conduct of those very men, who are declaiming against
<i>intemperance</i> and <i>crime</i>, that first drives their fellow
creatures into those deplorable haunts of vice. They do this
<i>indirectly</i>, and perhaps <i>innocently</i>. They do it by giving
too much reputation and influence to the wealthy class of the community,
by paying too much homage and respect to gold, and by withholding, from
the virtuous poor, that respect which their conduct merits. We cannot set
this truth before you in a more forcible light, than by relating, from
memory, an anecdote of Dr. Franklin, with which we will conclude. The
rich merchants and professional men in Philadelphia proposed to form
themselves into a social circle from which all <i>mechanics</i> were to
be excluded. The paper, drawn up for the purpose, was presented to Dr.
Franklin for his signature. On examining its contents, he remarked that
he could not consent to unite his name inasmuch as by excluding mechanics
from their circle, they had excluded God Almighty, who was the greatest
mechanic in the universe!</p>

<h2><a name="sermon17"></a>SERMON XVII</h2>

<blockquote>"And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving
one<br>
 another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."<br>
Ephesians iv. 32.</blockquote>

<p>A tender heart is the kind boon of heaven, and forgiveness is a virtue
too little exercised in the common intercourse of life. Men are too apt
to be in character Pharisees. They are too apt to love those that love
them, and hate their enemies. Retaliation is inconsistent with the spirit
of the gospel, and is a vice deeply to be stigmatized and deprecated by
all lovers of peace and morality. By retaliation, we are to understand
the injuring of another because he has injured us. This spirit of revenge
betrays a contracted mind in which the feelings of compassion and
forbearance never found a permanent abode. A man of a peevish, irritable
and revengeful temperament, is to be pitied, instead of being injured in
return. By retaliating the evil he may have done, you involve yourself in
the same condition of meanness, and in your turn become the injurer.</p>

<p>All those men, whose names are rendered illustrious and immortal, have
been distinguished for a spirit of forbearance, kindness and mercy. Were
there no examples of rashness--no failings and imperfections among men,
there would, then, be no opportunity to distinguish ourselves by a spirit
of forgiveness. God has so constituted the present existence of his
creatures, that the perfections of his divine character might be
manifested to them in the unchanging exercise of his paternal compassion
and forgiveness; and thus afford them an opportunity to imitate himself
in the exercise of those exalted feelings, which emanate from heaven.</p>

<p>We are not, however, to understand that tenderness of heart and
forgiveness are to be exercised to the utter exclusion of the principles
of honor and justice. If our children offend, or our dearest earthly
friend do wrong, we are to manifest the feelings of tenderness and
forgiveness, but these ought not to induce us to overlook their crimes or
faults, by remaining silent in regard to their vices. This would be
suffering our compassion to degenerate into weakness. It would in fact be
hardness of heart. It would betray a spirit of indifference to their
dearest interest, as by our silence, they might remain in blindness to
the demerit of their deeds, and hurry on to the ruin of their reputation,
and consequently, of their earthly happiness. True tenderness of heart
makes us watchful over the conduct of those we love, and with whom we are
connected in life--moves us to lay naked before them their faults, so
that they may early correct them, and thus inspires their hearts with
tenderness, and prompts them to regard the happiness, feelings and
welfare of others. It is immaterial how near and dear your friend may be,
you should, by the feelings of mercy, be induced to tell him his faults,
however much it may wound his heart. The wise man says "the wounds of a
friend are faithful; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful." Too many
parents, for want of determination of character, and for suffering their
compassion to degenerate into weakness and remaining blind to the faults
of their children, having seen them come to some disgraceful end--a state
prison, or even the gallows. This, instead of being true tenderness of
heart, was infatuation and the worst species of hardness and
insensibility to the welfare of their offspring. On the other hand, we
ought never to suffer a spirit of revengeful indignation to slumber in
our bosoms, ready on every trivial occasion to awake into resentment and
retaliation. In fine, we ought to imitate our God in feelings and conduct
towards each other, as it is expressed in our text. But many suppose that
God is filled with feelings of revengeful indignation towards his
creatures, and that the period is rolling on when he will cease to be
merciful, and will commence torturing us in the future world for the sins
committed in this, and that too, when punishment can do no good to the
sufferer--when reformation will be out of his reach. To torment a frail
dependent creature, under such circumstances, would be the most degrading
species of revenge. And if this is the conduct of God, then we must
practice the same, because we are commanded to imitate him. Our text
says--"Be yea kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another;
<i>even as</i> God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."</p>

<p>In this passage, our Father in heaven is held up to the world as the
model of <i>kindness tenderness</i> and <i>forgiveness</i>, that mortals
are to imitate. God is the moral standard to which every bosom ought to
aspire. The highest perfection and loveliness of man fall infinitely
short of the intrinsic loveliness and divine perfection's of Jehovah.</p>

<p>If he is the standard of moral excellence which we are to imitate,
then we must admit that the copy far exceeds the imitation. If man is
called upon to act like God in order to improve his character and
affections, then God is better than man, and every opposing objection
must, forever, fall to the ground. Perhaps it may be said, that all
denominations of men allow him to be so. This is not correct. It is true,
they <i>say this</i> in so many words. But words are <i>one</i> thing,
and what a doctrine involves is quite <i>another</i>. I might believe,
and most rigidly maintain, that an earthly father had prepared a palace
of comfort for his five <i>obedient</i> children, and a furnace of fire
to torture his five <i>disobedient</i> children; and suppose he had dealt
with his ten children as above stated;--with what propriety could I step
before the public, and contend that he was the best man in America? Even
were I persuaded, in my own mind, and firmly believed him to be the best
man in existence, would either my <i>belief</i> or <i>acknowledgment</i>
make it a fact? No; every man of common sense, and common humanity would
think me deranged. My saying that he was good, and even believing him so,
could not alter the awful reality, but would be an evidence of my want of
consistency and propriety. He would still be a bad unfeeling man, and in
no comparative sense so good as that father, who should punish his
children in mercy, and for their future amendment and benefit.</p>

<p>But what is all this compared with the character that thousands
ascribe to the God, who rules above? It is no more than the drop to the
unmeasured ocean: because those five children would soon cease to suffer;
but God, they contend, will torture without mercy or end, millions on
millions of his poor dependent creatures for the sins of a short life!
The most abandoned, and unrelenting savage, that roams the American
forest--the worst wretch in human form would not do this, but release, at
length, the sufferer from pain. And those, who contend that God will not
release, but on the contrary involve the victim of his ire deeper in who,
attribute to him a character infinitely worse, than the most cruel and
degraded of our race, and no argument, to the contrary, can be for one
moment maintained. If a man desire the holiness and happiness of all his
fellow creatures, and would bring them to a glorified state of beatitude
in heaven, had he the power, and still contends that God will not, it is
elevating his goodness far above the goodness of God. And for any man to
come forward with this acknowledgment on his lips, and yet address the
benignant Parent of all, and, in prayer, acknowledge him to be the best
of all beings, is only using words without propriety or meaning. There is
no sense, no reason in such logic. It completely contradicts itself, and
what is contradictory cannot be true.</p>

<p>Would you save all men from sin and its attendant misery if you could?
0 yes, is the answer, I would, and carry them all in the arms of
unbounded benevolence to glory. Well, has God the power to do it? Yes, is
the reply. But do you believe that be will exert his power so as to
accomplish it? No says the objector, I believe that he will sentence a
large portion of his erring offspring to endless and inconceivable wo.
Very well; then you are the best being of the two. And it is a melancholy
circumstance to these unfortunate beings, that you are not on the throne
of the universe. If this be so, then our text ought to be reversed. God
ought to copy your tenderness, and forgive men as you do! We are
certainly called upon to conform our conduct to the best standard, and to
imitate the <i>best</i> being. If you are the <i>best</i>, then God and
man ought to be called upon, and <i>entreated</i> to imitate you! No;
says the objector, God is superlatively the best being in the universe.
You may talk, and tell me so, till the morning sun sinks beyond the
western hills, and yet your <i>creed</i> will contradict every word you
utter. What you have just acknowledged, unchangeably stares you in the
face. You say, that you would forgive all, save them from sin, and raise
them to a blessed eternity, if you had the power. This power, you say,
God possesses, and yet you <i>believe</i>, and that he will not do it. It
is certainly an unfortunate circumstance to the human family, if their
Father in heaven is destitute of that goodness which you feel! From whom
did you receive all those compassionate feelings of heart? Why says the
objector, God gave them to me. But how can God give you what he has not
himself? If you possess more benevolence than God, you could not have
received it from him; because on this principal he did not have it in
possession to give. Surely he could not communicate to you, or any other
being, what he did not originally possess. From what source, then, did
you derive so much tenderness and love? There must, certainly, be some
being in the universe in whose bosom is rooted as much benevolence and
love as you feel, or how could it have been communicated to you from
another? Now, where did you get it? God gave it to me, says the objector.
This cannot be, because your doctrine proves, that you have more love
than the God who made you! If you insist that he has given it to you, has
he not in such case, given you more than he originally possessed? He has.
If so, endless misery may be true; for on this principle he has none
left!</p>

<p>The scriptures teach that "God is love"; and all his works speak the
same language--saying, "the Lord is good, and his mercies endure
forever." But how good is he? The doctrine of endless wrath says, he is
not as good as you. You are but a small stream from an infinite ocean of
love; and yet this little stream is greater than the ocean from which it
issues, and rises far above its fountain head! Can this be true?
Impossible. 0, do you not perceive how your own feelings, which you daily
experience, contradict your creed! You feel, desire, and pray for the
salvation of all men, and if you had the power, all your feelings,
prayers and desires would be carried into execution. And yet your
doctrine denies, that God, the fountain, in which all your affections
originate and live, will do it;--and at the same time you say, that you
have no love only what he gave you! What inconsistencies, contradictions
and blindness are here! Man, a small drop, from the benevolent fountain
God, is willing to do, what the source from whence he came is unwilling
to do! Then a drop of love, in the human bosom, is more tender and
benevolent than an ocean in the God, who placed it there!</p>

<p>We all know, that the fountain must be more extensive than the stream
it sends forth--yea, larger, than all its running streams put together.
This we know to be correct, as well as we know, that the sun enlightens
the world. Let us then collect these little streams into one. Bring, if
you please, into one body, the love and benevolence of men and angels, of
cherubim and seraphim--stretch your thoughts to unnumbered worlds,
extract the love from countless bosoms, and condense the whole into one
being. How great, lovely, and adorable, would that creature be! Then, let
the question be put to him---from whence did you derive all those noble
qualities of love, mercy and goodness? He replies, <i>from my Father
God!</i> Now, we must grant, that God far exceeds him in goodness,
because this noble creature is but an emanation from him--and the good
desires of this creature would be equal to the good desires of the
countless millions of men and angels in all worlds; and could have no
other intentions only those, which goodness and mercy dictate--and
goodness itself can do nothing contrary to its own nature, any more than
ice can burn or fire freeze. This creature would desire the happiness of
all; and yet <i>even he</i> is but a small rivulet flowing from the
crystal fountain of life and being! This creature would institute a
government <i>perfectly merciful</i>; and mercy would, of course,
require, that the <i>disobedient</i> should be punished to bring them to
<i>obedience</i>, and perfect them in the same state of glorification and
love with that being itself.</p>

<p>"God is <i>love</i>," and it, therefore, follows that he is
<i>love</i> to every creature he has made, and it is utterly impossible
that he can do any thing contrary to his own nature. "He cannot deny
himself." He will, therefore, do all that love dictates. It is consistent
with parental love to punish for the good of its offspring, but not to
punish unmercifully. But inquires the objector, does God punish for the
good of his creatures? We will let Paul settle this question--Heb. xii.
chap. "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom he receiveth. But if ye be without chastisement, whereof <i>all</i>
are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons. Furthermore, we have
had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence;
shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits and
live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
pleasure, but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his
holiness. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
grievous; nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceably fruit of
righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby." Now show us, if you
can, any punishment which God inflicts, that contradicts his paternal
goodness. It cannot be done. He has threatened and inflicted
<i>everlasting punishment</i> upon nations, as such, but not a solitary
passage can be produced from Genesis to Revelations, where he has
threatened any individual with <i>everlasting</i> punishment.</p>

<p>God is the adorable fountain of all tenderness, love, and compassion,
and no mother's son was imbued in the fount of mercy like his, who was
"the brightness of his glory and the express image of his perfections."
True, her yearnings over the babe of her bosom are great; still they bear
but little comparison to him who breathed those feelings there. God
compares himself to the mother. "Can a woman forget her sucking child"?
Woman, being of a more delicate formation than man, possesses a mind
susceptible of more fine, deep, and lasting impressions than his. The
affections of her soul, when fully roused into action, and fixed upon
their object, are deeper than those of man, extend far beyond the compass
line of his, and nobly range those sequestered haunts--those delightful
fields of mental felicity, where his finest affections never penetrated.
Let her heart once become fixed upon its darling object, and it is
immaterial in what situation in life we contemplate her--whether
prosperous or adverse, we behold the same unshaken constancy, the same
bright and burning flame. Her love to her children is pure as the
dew-drops of the morning, high as the heavens and unchanging as the sun.
It scorns dictation, bids defiance to oppression, and never for one
moment loses sight of its object. No disappointments that cross her path,
no scenes of adverse fortune that darken her sky, can wrench it from her
grasp, obscure it from her vision, or tear assunder the silken cord that
binds it to her heart.</p>

<p>The truth of these remarks we see verified in that unwearied
watchfulness and care, which she exercises over her children in supplying
their countless, and ever varied little wants; in allaying their little
griefs, in soothing their tender hearts by the soft whispers of
encouragement and love; in hushing them to repose and in watching over
the slumbers of their pillow. Are her children exposed to danger, and
full in her view? Then no devouring flame, that wraps her dwelling in
destruction--no rolling surges that lash the foaming main, can, in such a
moment of peril, over-awe her spirit, or deter her from rushing into the
very jaws of death to save them. Are they sick? Sleepless she sits beside
their bed, and watches every breath they draw. Are they racked with pain?
Her soul inhales the pang; and freely drinks at the same fount of agony,
and breathes over them the prayer of mercy. Love is that <i>attribute</i>
in her nature to which all the <i>others</i> are subservient. It is the
<i>shrine</i> at which they all bow, the <i>centre</i> to which they all
gravitate. If her children do wrong, she freely forgives.</p>

<p>Has God given the mother all these noble affections, and does he feel
less to his helpless, sinful and erring children? Let God answer--"Can a
woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on
the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget
thee."</p>

<h2><a name="sermon18"></a>SERMON XVIII</h2>

<blockquote>"And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving
one<br>
 another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."<br>
Ephesians iv. 32.</blockquote>

<p>In our last, we showed that that compassion, tenderness, and love of
our Father in heaven, are the origin of all the sublime affections in the
human bosom, and from this acknowledged fact, have shown that he is
infinitely more regardful of the welfare of his offspring than the tender
mother, with whom he compares himself; is of the welfare of her sucking
child. We now resume the subject.</p>

<p>In our text, we are called upon to forgive one another, as God has
forgiven us. In examining this point, we are to be guided by what he has
revealed. The question here arises, how many does God command us to
forgive? He commands us to forgive <i>all</i>, even our enemies. This
then must be forgiving them as he does. He therefore forgives all. He
commands us to bless them that curse us, and to pray for them that
despitefully use us, and persecute us, that we may be the children of our
Father in heaven. Does God command us to do more than he is willing to do
himself? No, he lives up to his own command. If God requires us to
forgive, even as he does, and then commands us to love and forgive
<i>all</i>, then he loves, and forgives <i>all,</i> otherwise he would
violate his own command; and then there would be no resemblance between
his forgiveness and ours. Even as God, for Christ's sake hath forgiven
you, so ought ye also to forgive one another.</p>

<p>Would you forgive all, and bring them home to glory? Yes. Will God?
No, says the objector, he will not forgive his enemies, but his friends
only. Then you must not forgive all. Do you ask why not? Because you are
to forgive, <i>even</i> as God. He is the standard you are to imitate. If
you forgive more than God, you are better than he. He cannot command you
to do different from himself. If God requires you to love and forgive
<i>all</i>, while he himself will forgive only a part, then God acts
contrary to his own command. We are exhorted in the text <i>to be kind,
tender-hearted and forgiving even as he is</i>. Do your kindness,
tenderness, and forgiveness extend to all, and desire the happiness of
the universe? Yes. Then also does that of God, or else you are, in every
sense of the word, better than he. You differ from, instead of imitating
God. If so, you are doing wrong, because you are violating the text. He
commands you to be kind, tender, and forgiving <i>only as he is</i>;--and
you contend that his kindness, tenderness and forgiveness, extend to a
part only, and that all the rest he will torture world without end.</p>

<p>But, says the objector, God is now kind, tender, forgiving, and
merciful to all; but he will not be so, when they enter eternity, for
"the doors of mercy will then be shut." How do you know that ?--who told
you so? Will God change in some future day? If he change, he will not be
the same being, he is now. I thought, he was the same yesterday, today,
and forever, without variableness or even the shadow of turning. I
thought he was the same Jehovah in all worlds. Do you intend to make him
kind, tender, and forgiving <i>here</i>, but unkind, unforgiving, and
hard-hearted to a part of his offspring <i>hereafter</i>? If you intend
to change both the nature and character of the Almighty in the future
world, then you and myself are done arguing. That doctrine is, certainly
in a pitiful condition , which drives its advocate to the necessity of
changing the Almighty wholly into another being to support it. "God so
loved the world, even when dead in trespasses and sins," as to deliver up
his Son to "taste death for every man." And being unchangeable ,he could
never hate them. In our text, God commands us to forgive as he has
forgiven. How many does God forgive? Ans. as many as he commands you to
forgive. How many is that? <i>All, even your enemies--to bless and curse
not.</i></p>

<p>We will now introduce the question--If God has not forgiven a man
today, will he ever forgive him? I answer no, for he is unchangeable. We
are to apt to think that our Creator is altogether such an one as
ourselves--that he loves one day, and hates the next--that he is in
reality angry one hour, and pleased the next-- or that he holds a grudge
one moment and forgives the next, if we will only ask him to do so. But
all such ideas are calculated for children--for babes in Christ. The
scriptures come down to the weakest capacity; but this is no reason we
should always continue children, but rise in knowledge to the strength of
manhood. We ought not to be "ever learning and never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth. Paul said to his brethren "when for the time ye
ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you" &amp;c. "When I
was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a
child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things."</p>

<p>The Scriptures are calculated for every capacity--for a child as well
as a philosopher. We must rise from one degree of glory to another. We
are not to fasten our minds down on the inventions of men, and live and
die children. No--we must "forget the things that are behind, and reach
forward to those that are before." As full grown men, we are not to
suppose that prayer of any mortal can move the Almighty to pardon him.
But says the objector, if we sincerely ask God to do thus and so, he will
certainly grant our request. Very well, admit this for a moment. God, you
say, will answer every <i>sincere</i> prayer. Now suppose two armies are
to meet in battle, one from France and the other from Holland. The hour
when the engagement is to commence is precisely one month from tomorrow
noon. Every day, there are millions of sincere prayers offered to God to
give them the day. Holland, with one voice, prays for victory and for the
preservation of her subjects; and France, with united supplication, prays
right the contrary. How, we ask, are all those <i>sincere</i> opposing
petitions to be answered? Impossible. Again--one denomination prays for
the prosperity of its cause, and the destruction of error. And as each
believes all others to be in error, of course pray for their downfall. If
the Lord answered their petitions, all denominations, of course, of
course would fall! One man prays far rain, and another, that it may not
rain. If God answered all these petitions, he would be as changeable, not
as <i>one man</i>, but as the whole human family together.</p>

<p>As it respects God&rsquo;s pardoning the human race, I contend that
this pardon existed from the beginning. Do not the Scriptures declare
that God chose us <i>in Christ</i> before the foundation of the world?
Yes, for "he calleth those things which be not as though they were."
Well, could we be chosen <i>in Christ</i> without being pardoned? No, for
the apostle says, "he that is <i>in Christ</i> is a new creature;" and,
certainly, a man cannot be a new creature <i>in Christ</i> without being
pardoned in the mind of Deity. If then in the omniscient mind of God, to
whom there is no future, they were chosen <i>in Christ</i> before the
foundation of the world, then in his mind, they must also have been
pardoned before the world began. God never does a new act. By
<i>pardon</i> we are not to understand the clearing of a guilty man from
deserved punishment, but an entire deliverance from a disposition to sin.
The period, when we are to be released from sin, is through death, where
the earthly nature, with all its wants and temptations to sin, falls, and
the heavenly nature rises in incorruption and glory through a
resurrection from the dead. Is not this the day of redemption when we are
set free? Yes, so saith the Scripture. Well do not <i>redemption,
remission</i>, and <i>forgiveness</i> mean the same thing? They do. Then
our <i>pardon, remission</i> or redemption will be <i>realized</i>
through death and the resurrection. We will produce the Scriptures. "in
whom we have <i>redemption</i> through his blood, even the
<i>forgiveness</i> of sins according to the riches of his grace." Here
forgiveness and redemption are used synonymous, and are declared to be
<i>through the blood of Christ</i>--that is, through his death, as a
sacrifice for sin. Sin cannot exist beyond the sacrifice designed to take
it away. He is represented as taking away the sin of the world under the
figure of a <i>Lamb.</i> Sin will come to a finish, under the first
covenant, exactly where Christ said "it is finished," at which moment the
vail, concealing the "holy of holies," will be rent in twain, and the
second covenant be opened. If we step beyond what Christ has said, we may
as well give up the Scriptures, and trust to our own vain imaginations.
There sin will end; and that is <i>dismission</i>, pardon or redemption
from it. "O death! where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory? The
<i>sting</i> of death is <i>sin,</i> and the <i>strength</i> of sin is
the <i>law</i>--but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through
our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>Now, here it is represented, that our victory, over <i>sin</i> and
<i>death</i>, is <i>when</i> we rise to immortal glory. Our
<i>victory</i> over sin is at the <i>same instant</i> with our victory
over <i>death</i>; and who will deny that our <i>victory</i> over
<i>death</i> will be at the resurrection? The objector may as well deny
our victory over <i>death</i> at the resurrection, as to deny our
<i>victory</i> over <i>sin</i> at that period. The whole is said to be
"through Christ." He was our "forerunner" and "first fruits" to represent
our condition <i>there</i>. When he expired, he was free from
<i>pain</i>, and when he arose, be was free from <i>temptation</i>. So
when we pass the same scene, we shall be like <i>him</i>, who is our
"resurrection and life," otherwise the harvest will not be like "the
first fruits."</p>

<p>God, then pardoned the human race, <i>in Christ</i>, when he made
them. How? Ans. by ordering their existence in such a manner, that they
should be freed from sin through death and the resurrection. That is the
day of our final discharge--the day, when the prisoner shall be set
free--the day, when our redemption shall come. But asks the objector, are
we not to <i>realize</i> our pardon in this world? Ans. Only <i>through
faith</i> in the <i>reality</i>. We look forward, and anchor our hope
within the veil of death, and enjoy our pardon, or redemption, only by an
eye of faith. This "faith works by love and purifies the heart." It
causes us, in a great measure, to break off our sins by righteousness.
But this has no influence, whatever, over the sins already committed. For
<i>them</i>, we must still continue to feel miserable. Punishment is
<i>certain</i>. From the sins that are committed, we only enjoy our
pardon or redemption from them through faith in Christ the resurrection.
Paul told the believers, that if there were no resurrection, their faith
was vain, they were yet in their sins. This proves that they only enjoyed
the pardon of their sins through faith in the resurrection, otherwise I
see no force in his language.</p>

<p>But inquires, the reader, why do you pray that God would pardon our
sins? Ans. I do not pray to turn the Almighty from his will and purpose;
but humbly trust, that I spend my days in searching out what "that
perfect will of God is," and then pray in reconciliation to his revealed
will. It is wicked to pray what we do not believe. "Whatsoever is not of
faith is sin." I believe that God pardoned us from the beginning, and
that this pardon will be realized through death and the resurrection. And
when I pray that God would pardon our sins, I mean that he would grant us
an evidence of that pardon, which unchangeably existed in his eternal
mind, by enlightening our understanding in the Scriptures of truth, and
giving us correct views of his character as a Being of tenderness and
compassion to the children of men. So when we say, God has pardoned us,
we do not mean that he has been moved by our petitions to do a new act;
but that through the appointed means, he has so far enlightened our
minds, that we have received an evidence of that pardon which existed
with him from the beginning, and by faith we look forward, believing it
will take place through death and the resurrection, as Christ has proved.
By this faith we perceive the love of God, and break off our sins by
righteousness. But while in the flesh, we feel a thorn--a hell of
conscious guilt for the sins we have committed, and though the penitent
may beseech God, that this messenger of satan, buffeting him, may depart
from him, yet the answer will be, "my grace is sufficient for thee."</p>

<p>We now perceive how God pardons sin, and yet punishes us for it. The
misery, sin brings upon us, is our just punishment, and to be released
from it, by the free grace of God, through death and the resurrection, is
our pardon and redemption--For example--we say, in a cloudy day, "the sun
does not shine;" but still he does. The clouds, just above our heads,
prevent his rays from shining upon us. The change is not in the sun. The
clouds disperse, and we say, "the sun shines, while in fact he is ever
the same. The Scriptures say, "our God is a sun." He is unchangeably the
same in all his brilliant perfections. "Sin like a cloud, and
transgression like a thick cloud," rise over the mind and darken the
understanding. Through this dark medium we look up to God, and think he
has changed--that he is angry, and thunders are rolling from his hand,
while in fact the whole change is in us. The moment our minds are
enlightened by the beams of truth we rejoice, and say God has forgiven
us. We receive an evidence of pardon, and enjoy it through faith, while
God has remained unchangeably the same.</p>

<p>While we are children in christianity, we speak and act like children;
and think if we join together, and pray as loud as we can as though the
Lord were "deaf, or all asleep or on a journey," that we can prevail, and
make him do as we wish. And while we are children, if we sin, we think
the Lord is our enemy, and is angry. Now, this is all well enough for
those whose experience has gone no further. We are not to "despise the
day of small things," but kindly receive such an one as a babe in Christ,
and feed him with milk. But still it does appear to be a pity that
thousands, under the gospel, should live and die children.</p>

<p>"Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another,
even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." Now, we are to forgive
as God does. How is that?--To hold a grudge one day, and if they ask our
pardon, to forgive them the next? No, we must uniformly possess a kind,
tender-hearted, forgiving spirit, laying up nought against any one.
Forgiveness does not consist in laying up a store of malice and
vengeance, till our enemy come, and formally ask our forgiveness. No--he
might never come, and then we could never forgive him. We are commanded
to love and forgive our enemies whether they ask it, or not. So did our
Saviour on the cross, and we are to exercise the same spirit of
benevolence and meekness. We must, as our context says--put away all
malice, wrath, and evil speaking from among us, and be kind,
tender-hearted and forgiving.</p>

<p>Our Father in heaven is the most lovely and adorable of all beings!
Under the light of his character, every uncomfortable thought vanishes,
and the dawn of a blessed eternity bursts upon us in a flood of glory. By
faith we penetrate the veil of immortality, and read our pardon, and
justification in letters of blood. Within that veil, we anchor our hope.
Faith triumphs over the ruins of death, smiles at the darkness of the
tomb, and through Christ within, the hope of glory, bids defiance to the
crushing hand of death, and lights up its dreary mansions with the
cheering beams of immortal day.</p>

<blockquote>"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house

God? And if<br>
the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner

1 Peter iv: 17, 18</blockquote>

<p>Upon this passage, the believers in endless misery lean for the
support of that sentiment, and on many occasions it is quoted with an air
of triumph as though the passage itself, without comment, were sufficient
to silence all objections. Here they have one advantage of Universalists;
and of this advantage they do not forget to avail themselves&mdash;viz:
the prejudices of early education. But we sincerely call their
application of this passage in question, and shall stand forth in defense
of the triumphs of Jesus Christ over all sin, and pain and death, fully
believing that the hand of heaven "shall wipe tears from off all faces."
We will attempt to show, &mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;What we are to understand by <i>judgment</i> beginning at
the house of God.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Who were the <i>righteous,</i> and in what sense they
were scarcely saved.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Show who were the <i>ungodly,</i> and where they
appeared.</p>

<p><i>First&mdash;What we are to understand by judgment beginning at the
house of God</i>. Jesus Christ chose him twelve disciples and commenced
the great work the Father sent him to do. To them he disclosed many
events, that God would in a future day bring upon the world. He pointed
them forward with more than human accuracy into the approaching
revolutions of time, and painted out in noon-day light those astonishing
disasters that would one day burst like a thunderclap on the thoughtless
nations. He marked their certainty, and warned them accordingly. Among
the many things, that lay buried in the vista of future years, was the
destruction of Jerusalem. This was a point that most solemnly concerned
the disciples of Jesus. It was no less than the destruction of their
nation.</p>

<p>Christ was with his disciples in the temple, that splendid edifice
which was forty and six years in building, and, in their presence and for
the last time, addressed the stubborn Jews. He pointed out the many
crimes of which they and their fathers had been guilty in shedding the
blood of the prophets, and persecuting those who were sent unto them as
the messengers of Jehovah. They had also made void the law of God through
their traditions. While pointing out these things, and setting them home
like a thunderbolt to their hearts, he pronounced them hypocrites, blind
guides, devourers of widows' houses, and declared that all the righteous
blood shed upon the earth should be required of of that generation. While
rehearsing these things to them, Jesus had a perfect view of all their
approaching sufferings. Many of them were to be starved to death. He saw
by a prophetic eye the indulgent father and fond mother weeping over
their infant train, who were begging for bread, but no way to procure it.
Eleven hundred thousand he saw in a state of starvation, who were to fall
by famine, sword and pestilence. He saw their cruel enemies surround the
walls of their city, who would allow no sustenance to be given them, but
determined to reduce them by hunger and sword to one common grave. All
these things, that were coming upon them, rushed at once upon the mind of
the compassionate Redeemer of the world. The affecting scene moved so
strongly upon his heavenly feelings, that he dropped the the melancholy
subject and burst into a flood of tears. He beheld the city and wept over
it&mdash;"O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets and
stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered
thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, but ye would not!" He then left the temple for the last time; but
as he was departing from it, his disciples, astonished at his
denunciation, and regretting that such a magnificent edifice should be
destroyed, exclaimed&mdash; "Master, see what manner of stones and what
buildings are here! And he said unto them there shall not be left here
one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down." The disciples
immediately asked him saying, "tell us when shall these things be, and
what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world?" By the
end of the <i>world</i> we are to understand the end of the Jewish
<i>age.</i> As they asked him the <i>signs</i> portending this terrible
destruction, so that they might know when it was nigh at hand, he
immediately proceeded to point them out, and warned them to flee to the
mountains of Judea for safety.</p>

<p>The signs are as follows&mdash;many false Christs should arise, there
should be wars and rumors of wars, nation should rise against nation,
kingdom against kingdom, and there should be famines, pestilences and
earthquakes in diverse places. Then shall they deliver you up to be
afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for
my name sake. Then shall there be great tribulation such as was not since
the beginning of the world to this time, no nor ever shall be. The most
prominent <i>sign</i> he gave them, and one that more immediately
concerned his disciples, was that they should deliver them up to be
afflicted, and they should be brought before kings and governors for his
name&rsquo;s sake. "But, (says Jesus) when they persecute you in one
city, then flee ye to another."</p>

<p>Christ gave his disciples plainly to understand, that when the Jews
began their persecutions against his followers, then the destruction of
Jerusalem was nigh at hand. After giving these instructions to his
disciples, he laid down his life, and on the third day he arose,
triumphing over death and leading captivity captive. His disciples soon
after commenced the spread of the gospel of peace, and waived the banners
of the cross over kings and subjects, calling upon them to bow to the
reign of Jesus Christ, who was King of kings, and Lord of lords. They
proclaimed a religion so contrary to the partial notions of the Jews and
the traditions of the Elders, that it began at length to meet with
violent opposition. The disciples agreeably to the direction of Jesus
fled for safety from city to city, till the tumult and opposition became
general. Christianity gathered force and popularity so rapidly, that the
Romans, it appears, gave permission to the Jews to imprison and take
life. The disciples and christians had now no place of safety to flee to,
from the gathering storm of persecution and death. Amidst these
disastrous scenes, Peter called to mind the <i>warnings</i> and
<i>signs</i> his risen Lord had pointed out as a solemn premonition that
the destruction of Jerusalem and of their persecutors, was nigh at hand,
and in view of the approaching calamity over which Jesus wept, Peter
exclaims, "The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God,
and if it begin first at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not
the gospel of God?" Thus we, see that what is meant by <i>judgment</i>
beginning at the <i>house</i> of God, is <i>persecution</i> beginning at
the <i>christians,</i> which persecution was a <i>sign</i> to them that
the destruction of that nation was nigh at hand. The reader will perceive
that what the apostle calls <i>"house of God,"</i> he afterwards calls
<i>"us,"</i> in the same sentence, and must refer to the christians, who
are in many scriptures called the <i>house, temple,</i> and
<i>building</i> of God. [See Heb. iii:6. Eph. ii:21, 22.] That the
persecutions were stated by Christ as a <i>sign</i> of the impending
judgment of God upon the Jews, is evident from the words of Paul, 2
Thess. i: 5, where he calls them "a manifest <i>token</i> of the
righteous judgment of God" upon the unbelieving Jews, the persecutors of
the christians.</p>

<p><i>Second&mdash;Who were the righteous, and in what sense they were
scarcely saved.</i> The righteous, mentioned in the 18th verse, mean the
same persons called <i>"the house of God,"</i> and <i>"us,"</i> in verse
17th, and has reference to those christians <i>only,</i> who lived
previous to the destruction of the temple, and not to any christians that
lived subsequent to that event, much less does it refer to all the
righteous that have ever existed or shall hereafter exist, as common
opinion asserts.</p>

<p>Under this head, we were also to show in what sense these righteous
were <i>scarcely</i> saved. It could not mean that their salvation in the
future world was <i>scarce</i> or uncertain; for it is <i>certain</i> in
the counsels of God, and in all things well ordered and <i>sure.</i> He
has given to his Son the heathen for an inheritance and the uttermost
parts of the earth for a possession. And all the Father hath given him
shall come unto him, and he will raise them up the last day. He is mighty
to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him; and no one will
deny that the righteous come unto him. How then can their eternal
salvation be denominated <i>scarce?</i> Impossible. How then are the
scriptures to be reconciled with our text, when they declare eternal life
to be the gift of God&mdash;that we are saved by grace&mdash;that help is
laid upon one mighty to save&mdash;that his arm is not shortened that it
cannot save; and that the power of God is to be exerted at the
resurrection in making them equal unto the angels? The answer is easily
given&mdash;our text has no reference whatever to the immortal world, to
a judgment at the end of time, nor to the final condition of the human
family; but simply refers to the narrow escape of the christians from the
destruction of Jerusalem, when they fled with their lives in their hands
to the mountains of Judea for safety.</p>

<p>In the 24th chapter of Matthew Jesus clearly describes the dreadful
scene. He says&mdash;"Then let them which be in Judea flee into the
mountains. Let him which is on the house top not come down to take any
thing out of his house. And woe unto them that are with children and to
them that give suck in those days!" [Why? Because they could not remain
in the mountains during the period that the city was besieged by the
Romans.] "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on
the Sabbath day." [Why? Because in the winter you would perish with
cold&mdash;and if your flight from the city be on the Sabbath day, the
Jews will stone you to death for traveling more than three miles.] "For
there shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of
the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days
should be shortened there should no flesh be saved;" [Saved from what?
Ans. from death.] "but for the elect's sake those days shall be
shortened." That is, for the sake of the christians who fled to the
mountains, God shortened the days of the siege. Let us hear Dr. Adam
Clarke, a Methodist Commentator, on this&mdash;"Josephus computes the
number of those who perished in the siege at eleven hundred thousand,
besides those who were slain in other places; and if the Romans had gone
on destroying in this manner, the whole nation of the Jews would in a
short time have been entirely extirpated; but for the sake of the elect,
the Jews, that <i>they</i> might not be utterly destroyed, and for the
christians particularly, the days were shortened. These partly through
the fury of the zealots on the one hand, and the hatred of the Romans on
the other; and partly through the difficulty of subsisting in the
mountains without houses or provisions, would in all probability, have
all been destroyed, either by sword or famine, if the days had not been
shortened."</p>

<p>Let us hear Clarke explain how these christians were <i>scarcely</i>
saved. "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
"It is very remarkable that not a single christian perished in the
destruction of Jerusalem, though there were many there when Cestius
Gallus invested the city; and had he persevered in the siege, he would
soon have rendered himself master of it; but when he unexpectedly and
unaccountably raised the siege, the christians took that opportunity to
escape." Clarke says <i>"unto the end"</i> means "to the destruction of
the Jewish polity." Therefore when Peter says, the righteous are
<i>scarcely saved,</i> he had reference to the dreadful judgment which
was coming upon "the wicked and ungodly" inhabitants of Jerusalem for
shedding the blood of the righteous, and from this destruction the
christians escaped with their lives in their hands to the mountains of
Judea for safety as Jesus had directed them. They but just
escape&mdash;they were <i>scarcely</i> saved.</p>

<p>The christians also suffered persecution from the Jews; and Peter
draws this inference from it&mdash;If we, who obey the gospel of God,
have to endure so many persecutions from the Jews&mdash;if this judgment
begins at us, how much sorer punishment will our enemies have to endure,
who obey not the gospel of God? And if we the righteous are scarcely
saved from this long-predicted destruction, where will the ungodly and
the sinner appear? But how did Peter know that it was at hand? Because
the persecutions, which Jesus had given them as a<i>"sign"</i> or
<i>"token"</i> had then commenced at the house of God. The reader will
now perceive that Peter was not speaking of a judgment at the end of
time, because the judgment of which he was speaking had then
commenced&mdash;"<i>The time is come."</i> Neither was he speaking of
christians generally, nor of salvation in the future world; but of those
christians <i>only</i> who lived previous to the destruction of the
Jewish polity, and of their being saved with <i>difficulty</i> by
watching the<i>signs</i> and fleeing to the mountains of Judea as Jesus
had forewarned them.</p>

<p>Luke records the language of Christ more plainly to be comprehended
than that of Matthew. "In your patience possess ye your souls. And when
ye shall see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then know that the
desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which be in Judea flee into the
mountains, and let them which are in the midst of it depart out," etc. We
should be led to suppose that, after the walls of the city were
surrounded by an army, it would then have been too late for the
christians to save themselves. But Christ as a prophet knew that Cestius
Gallus would raise the siege, and fall back to make preparations for a
more decisive attack, and thus afford the christians an opportunity to
escape. It is evident to every candid reader that Luke expresses in chap.
21st, all that Matthew does in chap 24th and 25th. And that Luke does not
refer to a judgment at the end of time is certain from the manner in
which he concludes, which is as follows: "And take heed lest at any time
your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares
of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares * * * Watch ye,
therefore, and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all
these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man.
"Here we perceive that not the least allusion is made to a judgment at
the end of time; because there would be no propriety in warning his
disciples not to be <i>drunk</i> or <i>overcharged with the cares of
life</i> at a judgment day thousands of years after their death. The day
when the christians were "to stand before the Son of man" was at the
destruction of the Jewish polity, and it was to take place in the life
time of some of the disciples. Christ says, "there be some standing here
that shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his
kingdom." The day of Christ was therefore at hand, and the apostles were
warned to keep it in view, and watch the signs that were to precede it.
Peter was faithful to these warnings, and when he saw the <i>signs</i>,
presaging its near approach, he exclaimed&mdash;<i>"The times is
come,"</i> etc. This was the day of tribulation, when the christians were
<i>scarcely</i> saved from the dreadful fate that overtook their own
countrymen, who remained blind till the things that made for their peace
as a nation were hidden from their eyes.</p>

God? And if<br>
the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner
appear?"<br>
1 Peter iv: 17, 18</blockquote>

<p>In our last we have attended to the first two divisions of our
subject&mdash;viz.: what we were to understand by judgment beginning at
the house of God, and who were the righteous, and in what sense they were
scarcely saved. We now invite the attention of the reader to the
remaining division of the subject. <i>Third&mdash;who were the ungodly,
and where they appeared.</i> By the <i>ungodly</i> and the <i>sinner,</i>
we are to understand the unbelieving Jews, the murderers of Christ and
the persecutors of his followers. It has <i>exclusive</i> reference to
them and not to the ungodly who lived subsequent to the destruction of
Jerusalem, much less does it refer to all the wicked that have ever
existed, or shall hereafter exist, as common opinion asserts. This needs
no further explanation.</p>

<p>Under this head, we were also to show <i>where the ungodly and the
sinner appeared.</i> We have already had occasion to state, that Peter in
our text refers to the destruction coming upon the Jews. The time was
come when that judgment of persecution, which began at the christians,
was to be returned upon the heads of their persecutors in seven fold
vengeance and suffering. Their city and nation were to be destroyed, and
their magnificent temple, where their devotions were offered, was to be
laid even with the ground. Not one stone was to be left upon another, but
the whole become one general heap of ruins. Then according to the
prediction of Jesus, was there to "be great tribulation, such as was not
since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."
Then was "wrath to come upon them to the uttermost." Then was he to "take
vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ." Then were "the children of the kingdom to be cast out into
outer darkness where there was wailing and gnashing of teeth." Then, as a
nation, were "they to go away into everlasting punishment;" for "these
were the days of vengeance when all things, that were written, might be
fulfilled," and "all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the
blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias, should come upon that
generation."</p>

<p>Titus led the Roman army against them, surrounded the walls of the
city on the day of the Passover, where a great part of the Jewish nation
were then assembled, and to which others had fled for refuge, being
driven by the terror of his arms like chaff before the whirlwind. Here
they appeared! Husbands and wives, parents and children, brothers and
sisters, (one promiscuous throng) were gazing in breathless solicitude,
while consternation and dismay were depicted in every countenance, and
fearful expectation pervaded every bosom! Death, a long lingering death,
was gathering around them in all its horrors! Old men and young, maidens,
matrons and little children poured forth their lamentations to heaven,
invoking the protection of the God of Israel. But, alas! "the things,
that made for their peace (as Jesus forewarned them) were hidden from
their eyes!" Their hour was come, and the triumphant shouts of the enemy
were heard around their stubborn walls, which (massy as they were)
dropped to the ground under the subduing power of the battering-rams of
war. With these massive engines of destruction, they laid the two first
walls in ruin! But the third and last wall it was not in the power of the
enemy to gain. The Jews fought with desperation, and by valiant exertions
kept the enemy at bay, and for a while seemed to triumph in the fond hope
of victory over the foe. The Roman army was driven to great extremity,
and even to hesitation, while many of their most valiant men fell in
action, and impending victory seemed to hang doubtful. In this moment of
suspense, they came to a determination to make no further attack upon the
city, but guard it and reduce its inhabitants to submission by famine.
All supplies were accordingly cut off, and every avenue blocked up by the
vigilant Romans. In addition to this, intestine divisions, civil wars and
pestilence raged within the walls of the city. Having no employment in
fighting the enemy, they fell to butchering each other. These things
proved their ruin, and their national sun went down in blood. Every day
thousands closed their eyes in death through famine and pestilence; and
thousands by endeavoring to escape to the enemy and surrender themselves
up as prisoners for safety and protection, were either cut down by the
Roman sword, or met the same fate from their own countrymen. Here they
appeared! All hopes of life cut off, nothing presented itself to their
view, to end their woes, but the certain prospect of an untimely tomb!
Fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, gazing upon each other in silent
expectation, saw death gradually advancing in all its horrors. They were
driven to the most dreadful extremities, until (is Josephus informs us)
"they devoured whatever came in their way; mice, rats, serpents, lizards,
even to the spider''&mdash;and lastly mothers were driven to eat the
flesh of their own children! Here were lamentation and wo indeed! Such
tribulation as our Saviour says never was, and never will be. In
imagination the mind runs back to the period, and to the fatal spot. It
surveys the painful scene, characterized by nought but moral and physical
woes&mdash;madness and revenge, cruelty and carnage, pestilence and
famine, and all the mingled horrors of war! It surveys the starving child
clinging to the maternal bosom for help and protection, but alas! that
bosom becomes its grave. Here the ungodly and the sinner appeared in deep
despair! Unfeeling mortal, do you say that their punishment and
sufferings were not sufficiently great, without adding that of immortal
pain in the future world? Are you not satisfied without arguing that they
ought to suffer endless misery in addition to their woes? Look with an
unjaundiced eye over this scene of distress; and as you gaze let justice
(if not compassion) once more take the throne of the heart, and then
pronounce the shocking sentence of your creed if you can.</p>

<p>That their sufferings were overwhelming is evident from scripture as
well as from history. In Lam. iv. the prophet Jeremiah says&mdash;"The
hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children, they were
their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people." In Lev.
xxvi. Moses describes their sufferings as follows&mdash;"And I will bring
a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when
ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence
among you, that shall make you few in number; and ye shall be delivered
into the hand of the enemy. And when I have broken the staff of your
bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver
you your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat and not be satisfied.
And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto
me; then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will
chastise you seven times for your sins. And ye shall eat the flesh of
your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat." This did come
upon the sinner and the ungodly, and it was "according to their sins."
Moses, Jeremiah, and Jesus spake particularly of the sufferings of the
Jews in the destruction of their city and they all agree in concluding
their chapters. Moses in conclusion says, "and they shall accept of the
punishment of their iniquities, even because they despised my judgments,
and because their soul abhorred my statutes; and yet for all that I will
not cast them away neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly and
to break my covenant with them, for I am the Lord their God." And
Jeremiah, after describing their sufferings in the 4th chapter of
Lamentations concludes with these words&mdash;"The punishment of thine
iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion," etc. And Jesus, after
denouncing upon them the judgments of heaven in Matt. xxiii. concludes
thus: "For I say unto you, ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall
say, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." Thus we see that
they agree in testifying to the same fact, that the punishment of the
ungodly and the sinner, which mean, no other than the Jewish nation in
their overthrow and dispersion as we have already noticed, shall end.</p>

<p>I see therefore no arguments, that can he drawn from our text, to
prove a future judgment or endless misery in the immortal world. If the
objector can see a shadow of evidence in this passage to support such a
sentiment, yet I must frankly acknowledge that, for myself, I cannot.
There is certainly no word in the text, that has the most distant
allusion to the final condition of man. The <i>judgment</i> began at the
apostles and christians. But is the <i>"last judgment"</i> to begin at
them? Certainly not. But admit that it is; we would further inquire, did
the last judgment begin as early as the days of Peter? Impossible. Then
he could certainly not have had any allusion to such a day, for he
exclaims: <i>"the time is come</i> that judgment must begin at the house
of God." Here the judgment to which he refers had commenced, or at least
the <i>signs</i> portending it had commenced, and it was to end upon the
ungodly inhabitants of Jerusalem. This fact is evident from the
context&mdash;"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the <i>fiery
trial</i> which is to try you, as though some strange thing had happened
unto you; but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also
with exceeding joy." From this quotation there can arise no
misapprehension as to Peter's application of the text, nor of the persons
it involves. They were the persecutors of the christians, and no one will
dispute that these were the Jews.</p>

<p>If then this judgment was at hand, it cannot of course refer to a
period at the end of time; and it is in this case equally certain, that
the <i>scarce salvation</i> of the christians can have no reference to
the immortal world. These facts being irresistible, the argument must be
wholly given up that "the ungodly and the sinner" were to appear in a
state of inconceivable torment beyond the grave, because the
<i>condition</i> of "the ungodly" stands in contrast with the <i>scarce
salvation</i> of the righteous, and this <i>salvation</i> or
<i>deliverance</i> was to be in a day nigh at hand, and from a
tribulation or judgment in which their adversaries and persecutors were
to be involved, and the <i>signs,</i> by which the apostle was admonished
of its proximity, had already appeared when he wrote the words of our
text. The meaning of his words, I humbly conceive, is simply
this&mdash;The time <i>is come</i> when the persecutions, predicted by
Christ as a <i>sign</i> of the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, must
begin at us. And if we the righteous who are innocent, have to endure so
many "fiery trials," what will the dreadful punishment be of our
disobedient persecutors? And if we are <i>scarcely saved</i> from this
impending destruction, by fleeing to the mountains of Judea, where will
our thoughtless and sinful appear? We have endeavored to show you where
they appeared&mdash;have pointed out the narrow escape of the christians,
who were "scarcely saved," and referred you to the <i>signs</i> by which
Peter knew this judgment was at hand. It is therefore unnecessary to
offer any thing further in defense of our views, as the text is, no
doubt, plainly understood by every reader.</p>

<p>We close this discourse by noticing one very common objection, made by
our religious opposers, to our application of several scriptures. I do
this, because I am not aware that it has been done by any Universalist as
a <i>designed</i> answer to the objection. The substance of the objection
is this:<i>&mdash;There is not a passage in the New Testament which
speaks of a day of judgment, of the end of the world and of the coming of
Christ, but what Universalists apply to the destruction of Jerusalem.
Then, they contend, "every man was rewarded according to his works,"
consequently all subsequent nations are not to be rewarded, nor are they
to experience a day of judgment.</i> In reply to this objection I would
remark, that we are not answerable for the many passages which the
Saviour and his apostles applied to that event. But if we make a wrong
application of any scripture, why do not our opposers point out the
error? We will now show why the apostles wrote so much in reference to
that period. They do not so frequently speak of that event merely on
account of the destruction of their temple city and nation, (though that
might justify their frequent reference to it) but there were
circumstances of a more imposing and momentous character to attract their
attention to that catastrophe. These were the abrogation of the Mosaic
rituals and the introduction of a new order of things by Jesus Christ of
whom Moses and the prophets wrote. This was a period when every christian
was to be delivered from the persecution of the Jews, and the spread of
the gospel was to be retarded no longer by their opposition. The Jews as
a nation were to be punished for their deeds of blood, and that
<i>spiritual reign</i> or <i>judgment</i> commence which should pass upon
all subsequent generations of men, rewarding every man according to his
works.</p>

<p>The <i>gospel reign</i> is called "the <i>judgment of the world"</i>
by Jesus Christ, in the same sense that Moses judged the world two
thousand years by the law. Jesus says, "Think not that I will accuse you
to the Father, for there is one that <i>judgeth</i> you even Moses in
whom ye trust." From this it is evident that Moses was then judging the
Jews. But this covenant was abolished at the destruction of Jerusalem.
Paul says, "he taketh away the <i>first</i> that he may establish the
<i>second."</i> The word of God, in this covenant, is spiritual and
sharper than any two-edged sword&mdash;it is a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart, while that of Moses was outward, and took
cognizance of the conduct only. The objections of our opposers are
therefore unsound. And though we apply those passages, which speak of a
judgment, to the destruction of the Jews, yet that judgment or reign of
Christ which then commenced, is yet going on, and will continue till all
are subdued to himself. He then came in his kingdom, and will continue to
reward every man according to his deeds till his kingdom ends. So we this
day experience the effects of his coming, and of his judgment or reign,
and are justified or condemned according as we embrace or reject the
words of everlasting life. We see therefore the propriety of the apostles
dwelling so much upon that great event, which should witness the passing
away of the types and shadows and the establishment of the gospel of
Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive"<br>
1 Cor. xv. 20.</blockquote>

<p>The death and resurrection of all mankind are a theme of no ordinary
moment, and have given birth to many theories and speculations among the
advocates of Christianity. The common opinion is that one portion of our
race will be raised to immortal life and glory in the future world, and
the other to immortal damnation and dishonor&mdash;that at the same
instant the living will be changed and that the whole human family will,
in this condition, be arraigned before the "Judge of quick and dead," and
receive their irrevocable sentence for endless joy or endless wo. Others
believe, in opposition to these limited views of the divine character,
that the resurrection is the closing scene of the great plan of
salvation, and that no judgment is to succeed it. This resurrection, they
believe, will introduce the numerous posterity of Adam into the same
condition of immortal glory and honor, being made, by the power of God,
"equal unto the angels, and be the children of God being the children of
the resurrection." As to the <i>judgment day,</i> they do not believe,
that the whole human family will be congregated in one amazing throng at
one period of time, but that the judgment of the world, by Jesus Christ,
commenced at the destruction of Jerusalem, when the Mosaic dispensation,
with all its imposing rituals, passed away, and that this
<i>judgment,</i> or in other words, this <i>gospel reign</i> of Christ,
is still progressing, and will completely terminate before the
resurrection takes place. Notwithstanding this view of the day of
judgment, yet they suppose that the <i>resurrection day</i> is a
designated period when the cerement of the dead shall burst, and all the
slumbering nations, simultaneously, start up from their beds of clay, the
living at the same instant be changed to immortal beings, and this
countless throng, in one unbroken strain, shout&mdash;"O death! where is
thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory"?</p>

<p>Though this scene would be full, and immortally sublime, and disclose
a grandeur which a seraph's eloquence never can describe, yet I take the
liberty to dissent from this long and fondly cherished opinion, and will
humbly endeavor to present you my views on the immortal resurrection of
the human dead. The ideas I have advanced in my sermons on the <i>new
birth,</i> require me to do this. And no one has more occasion to rejoice
than myself, that we are bound by no creeds, and that the preachers of
our order encourage and cherish free investigation. Among such able and
benevolent theologians, I feel conscious, if I err, that they will
endeavor, in the spirit of meekness, to set me right. I therefore hold no
one responsible for the ideas I am now about to advance. I am by no means
in favor of new theories built upon mere human speculations, nor do I
deem it an enviable task to make innovations on the long and universally
established opinions of the christian community. I shall simply appeal to
the scriptures to sustain me in my present exposition, and by that
standard I am willing my views should be tried, for by that alone, they
must ultimately stand or fall.</p>

<p>From the text we have selected, it might, perhaps, be expected, that
we should proceed to prove the final holiness and happiness of the human
family by showing, that he who is "made alive in Christ is a new
creature"; but as this has, heretofore been done so often and so ably, we
shall confine our attention, principally, to the different scripture
accounts of the resurrection of the dead, and endeavor to ascertain
whether it is indeed, to take place at the end of time and be general, or
whether it is continually transpiring as gradual as the successive deaths
of our race in Adam.</p>

<p>And here I would distinctly remark, that the dead are represented as
being raised at the coming of Christ. This is admitted and believed by
all. But where, I ask, is there in the Book of God <i>one passage</i> to
prove any coming of Christ after the destruction of the Jewish polity
when he commenced his <i>gospel reign,</i> called the <i>judgment of the
world?</i> This was his <i>second</i> coming; but where but where is
there a <i>scrap</i> of scripture to prove his <i>third</i> coming at the
end of time? For one, I have searched in vain for such testimony. That
Christ came in his kingdom, during the life time of the persons he
addressed, and then commenced the judgment of the world, is certain. This
is not, however, admitted to be that coming of Christ when the dead will
be raised immortal. Where then is revealed that <i>third</i> coming of
our Lord, at the end of time, to raise the dead? I think it will be an
unsuccessful task for any man to search it out and bring it forward.</p>

<p>I would not be understood to say, that no destruction will attend this
earth. On the contrary philosophy seems to warrant the idea. But the
scriptures no not, in my apprehension, reveal such a catastrophe, nor a
<i>third</i> coming of Christ, nor a general resurrection at that period.
The reader may, perhaps, here inquire whether the scriptures do not
clearly describe the resurrection of all mankind to be at one instant of
time? I answer, no more than they describe the judgment of all mankind to
be at the same instant. But, says the reader, the resurrection is to be
at the coming of Christ, which must be at some designated period. Very
well; the judgment was to be at the coming of Christ to the destruction
of the Jewish state, and does not this designate some particular period?
If so, how are we judged in the present day? If the judgment day, which
<i>then</i> commenced, has not yet ended, why may not the resurrection
day be still progressing? If you contend, that the dead were all to rise
at once, then by the same mode of scripture interpretation, I can prove
that all the living were to be judged at once. Acts xvii. 31. "Because he
hath appointed A DAY in the which, he will judge the world in
righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given
this assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead." 2
Cor. v.10. "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
that every one may receive the things in body, according to that he hath
done, whether good or bad."</p>

<p>Though this event is represented as transpiring in <i>one day,</i> and
as though all men were literally arraigned at the same instant, still all
Universalist admit, that it commenced at the destruction of Jerusalem,
has passed upon succeeding generations, and will continue from the
present down to subsequent ages, so long as human beings shall have a
habitation on earth. This is called the <i>last day.</i> Jesus
says&mdash;"the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the
<i>last day.</i>" So I contend, that though the resurrection is also
called the <i>last day,</i> and represented as raising all mankind at one
instant of time, still simply means, that the doctrine of Christ (viz.
the judgment and resurrection) should, at his coming in his kingdom, be
fully revealed to the living by their seeing his prophesies fulfilled in
the abrogation of the ceremonial law, and this doctrine of life and
immortality be permanently established and commence its sway over the
living, as the last and best system of God to man, and this
<i>resurrection day</i> continue down to all subsequent generations of
slumbering dead, raising every man in incorruption and glory. The
judgment and resurrection of the world are therefore both progressing,
for these two constitute the gospel reign of Christ. He is "the
resurrection and life of the world," as well as "judge of quick and
dead." Both are to be accomplished in the <i>last day,</i> and that day
is now progressing. A <i>general</i> resurrection<i>,</i> at the last
vibrating pendulum of time, cannot I humbly conceive, be substantiated by
the oracles of truth, any more than a <i>general</i> judgment. I am
rather inclined to think that <i>the judgment of the world by Jesus
Christ expresses the whole, including the resurrection and all; even as
the high priest, clothed with the breastplate of judgment on the day of
atonement, closed his services by raising the nation into the holy of
holies, "which was a pattern of things in the heavens."</i></p>

<p>If the Scriptures afford us any evidence of the <i>third</i> coming of
Christ, to raise the dead, for one, I must acknowledge my utter ignorance
of the fact. In John (chap. vi.) Jesus several times uses the expression,
"and I will raise him up at the last day." If others contend that this
has reference to <i>"the last day of the last generation of the human
race on the earth,"</i> yet I must candidly acknowledge, that I cannot
see a shadow of evidence to prove this position. The <i>last day</i> in
this instance, refers to the gospel dispensation, which commenced at the
destruction of the temple, and involves the whole reign of Christ. It is
synonymous with the "day of Christ" and the "day of the Lord" mentioned
in several places by the apostles. Nor do I conceive it means, that
Christ would raise them up by his own immediate power, but that God would
raise the dead according to that doctrine, which he sent his Son to
reveal to men, and this would be fully established in the world, and be
believed and felt by Jew and Gentile Christians at the coming of Christ
in his kingdom, at the end of that dispensation. <i>Then</i> and not till
<i>then</i> were the predictions of Christ fulfilled, and then were those
Christians, who had not seen Jesus after his resurrection, "made perfect
in faith."</p>

<p>The dead are to be raised at the <i>last</i> trump; by which I
understand the <i>seventh,</i> for no other <i>last</i> is revealed. This
trump is mentioned by our Saviour (Matt. xxiv. 31.) and is the gospel
trump which was to commence its sound at the destruction of Jerusalem. In
Rev. chap. viii, seven trumpets were given to seven angels, who are
represented as sounding them in succession, and increasing woes
following, till the sixth trumpet sounded. But when the seventh angel
sounded and the last dreadful wo passed away, a very different order of
things followed. Rev. x. 7. "But in the days of the voice of the seventh
angel when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished
as he hath declared to his servants the prophets." Rev. xi. 15. "And the
seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the
kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his
Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever." Now compare these woes and
this subsequent order of things with the tribulations Christ described in
Matt xxiv chap. and the subsequent life the righteous entered into, and
you will readily perceive that both refer to the destruction of Jerusalem
and the commencement of Christ's auspicious reign. (The Revelations were
certainly written before that event.) When the seventh angel sounded,
Christ came in his kingdom and began his reign; and that he began his
reign when the trumpet sounded, and the woes recorded in Matt. xxiv. and
xxv. chapters took place, will not be denied. This settles the point that
the <i>seventh</i> or <i>last</i> trump was not to sound at the close of
Christ's reign, but at its commencement. And under this last sounding
trump the dead were to be raised immortal, and those who were alive when
it commenced its sound, were to be suddenly changed in their
circumstances and feelings as described in the context. It was the day of
their redemption from all their trials and persecutions, and doubts and
fears.</p>

<p>That this was the period when the Christians entered the
<i>resurrection day</i> as well as the <i>judgment day</i> under Christ
is certain. They entered into the full enjoyment of that most sublime of
all doctrines in the faith of which they not only saw the dead raised
immortal and free from pain, but felt themselves new beings. They were
exalted from the dust to high and "heavenly places in Christ," were
"caught up to meet the Lord in the air," were seated "on thrones and made
priests and kings to God and reigned with Christ." There "they shone like
the brightness of the firmament and the stars forever and ever,"
recognized the goodness of God in redeeming love, and sang the song of
<i>certain victory</i> over death and Hades. Then "the kingdom and
dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven was
given to the saints of the MOST HIGH," and in this "kingdom of their
Father they shone forth like the sun." The above promiscuous quotations
from Scripture justify the expression, that the living were "changed in a
moment at the last trump," which announced to the world the immortal
resurrection of the dead. That this trump, whose sound proclaims the
resurrection of all mankind, is the gospel trump, the doctrine of Christ,
we cannot doubt.</p>

<p>That the change of the living, in the context, has any reference to
changing them into immortal beings, I cannot admit without further
evidence. It is contrary to the whole tenor of revelation&mdash;it is
contrary to our text, which declares that all, who are made alive in
Christ first die in Adam. As the change of the living is an important
point in our present investigation, we will give it further attention.
That the Christians were to experience a great and sudden change at the
destruction of Jerusalem is certain. They were to be delivered from all
their trials and persecutions, and be raised into the full and felicitous
enjoyment of the reign of Christ. Those Christians, who had not seen our
Saviour alive from the dead, who had believed on the testimony of his
apostles and of the "five hundred brethren," were delivered from all
their doubts and fears on seeing his predictions fulfilled, were
perfected in faith, and their "hearts established unblamable in
holiness." This was to them a resurrection day, not only in reviving
their faith and hope in the doctrine of the immortal resurrection of all
that died in Adam, but in delivering them from their sufferings, and
raising them into the sublime enjoyments of the reign of Christ. In
reference to this period, Jesus says, "thou shalt be recompensed at the
resurrection of the just." And Paul says, "If by any means I might attain
unto the resurrection of the dead, not as though I had already attained,
either were already perfect." What sense would there be in his
saying&mdash;if by any means I might, by my exertions, become an immortal
being, not as though I had already attained to immortal existence? No
sense at all. But the apostles meaning is clear, if we render it
thus&mdash;If by any means I might continue faithful unto the end, and
obtain a crown of life in the first resurrection at that day when Christ
shall come in his kingdom to destroy his enemies and to deliver and
elevate Christians to honor. We shall notice this more particularly in
our next when we come to comment on Philippians iii. chap. Again he
says&mdash;"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying the resurrection
is past already, and overthrow the faith of some." That is, to make the
Christians believe that their promised deliverance was past, while they
were yet in the midst of their sufferings, was calculated to overthrow
their faith. We will notice the change of the living still further. Jesus
says, that those, who were in their graves, and had done good, should
come forth to the resurrection of life. And Daniel says, that many of
them who sleep in the dust of the earth should awake to everlasting life,
and those, who were wise, should shine as the brightness of the
firmament, and they that turned many to righteousness as the stars
forever and ever. Here Daniel and Jesus represent the low, suffering, and
distressed condition of the Christians previous to the destruction of
Jerusalem, and their final deliverance and exaltation at that period, by
sleeping in the dust, being dead in their graves, and suddenly coming
forth to life and shining like the brightness of the firmament and the
stars forever and ever. This is equivalent with being "caught up in the
clouds to meet the Lord in the air."</p>

<p>The above changes are as great and as in instantaneous, as the apostle
represents in the context,&mdash;"We shall all be changed in a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound
and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed." As
if he had said we shall suddenly enter into the full fruition of that
glorious gospel kingdom, whose trump shall then begin, and continue to
sound down to the remotest periods of that <i>"last day"</i> proclaiming
the incorruptible resurrection of all the dead, and at the same time
changing the living from the low, sorrowful, and groveling thoughts of
earth to the sublime and joyful contemplations of "life and immortality
brought to light through the gospel." So the <i>last day,</i> in which
the last trump sounds, and the dead are raised, embraces the whole gospel
reign of Christ. The <i>resurrection</i> is coeval in duration with the
<i>judgment</i> of the world; for both are called the last day, and both
are represented as involving all mankind in one assemblage to be judged
and in one assemblage to be raised.</p>

<blockquote>"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive"<br>
1 Cor. xv. 20.</blockquote>

<p>We have already shown that the <i>judgment</i> of the world is called
the <i>"last day,"</i> in which all human beings are to stand at the
Judgment Seat of Christ, and receive according to their deeds. We have
shown, that this day commenced at the end of the Jewish age, and is to
continue down to all succeeding generations, so long as human beings
shall have a habitation on earth. We have shown that the
<i>resurrection</i> is also called the <i>"last day,"</i> in which all
the dead are to be raised immortal. We have shown that, as a doctrine of
God, it was permanently established in the world at the end of the Jewish
dispensation&mdash;that the last or gospel trump then commenced its
sound, proclaiming the immortal resurrection of all who "die in Adam,"
and at the same time changed those who were then alive&mdash;and that it
shall continue to sound to the remotest periods of this last day,
proclaiming the resurrection of the dead and changing or reforming the
living. We have shown that the <i>judgment</i> and <i>resurrection</i>
constitute the gospel doctrine of Christ, and, as such, both were
established in the world at the same time, and are both called the
<i>"last day,"</i> in which all men are in succession to be judged, and
raised immortal. The apostle Paul, when discussing to his hearers, either
the judgment or the resurrection, looked forward to that interesting
period, when they were to be established in the world, and, with a giant
effort, grasped in one view, the beginning and end of this brilliant,
sublime, and everlasting DAY, and presented it in mental vision to his
persecuted and almost desponding brethren as one instantaneous,
transporting and triumphant event, in which the world was to be judged,
the living changed, the dead raised immortal and incorruptible, and the
rapturous song of final victory was to be sung over death, its sting and
the grave.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to notice those passages, which are applied to the
immortal and general resurrection of the dead, point out their
misapplication, and reconcile them with the views we have advanced. We
will <i>first</i> notice our context. And here it will be necessary to
ascertain the condition of those whom Paul addresses. He introduces the
chapter by referring to the many witnesses of Christ's resurrection, and
commences his argument in proof of this fact, and against those
christians, who had not been eye-witnesses, but who had professed faith
in his resurrection <i>merely</i> on the testimony of the apostles. These
christians were suffering persecution, and were, of all men most
"miserable" if Christ were not risen from the dead; as in such case,
their future deliverance and exaltation at his predicted coming, were but
a visionary dream. And as their Lord seemed to delay his coming, "some
among them (being discouraged) began to say, there was no resurrection of
the dead." The great evidence, to which they were looking for the final
proof of his being the true Messiah was the fulfillment of all which the
prophets had written of "the daily sacrifice being taken away, the holy
people being scattered" and of the glory of the Messiah's kingdom and
reign, and of all, which Jesus himself had predicted of his coming to
destroy their persecutors, to put an end to the Mosaic dispensation, and
to raise them to a state of exaltation in his kingdom. They had not seen
Jesus alive from the dead as had the apostles; and however much they
might be inclined to credit their testimony, yet their severe
persecutions and sufferings, and the protracted period of his coming
would, very naturally, create, in their hearts many doubts and fears as
to its truth.</p>

<p>These are the persons, whom Paul addresses in our context, and labors
to keep them in the faith by presenting the <i>whole weight</i> of
testimony in favor of the resurrection of Christ, on which he hinged the
resurrection of man. He summons before them more than five hundred
eye-witnesses, of whom himself was one, to satisfy them of the fact, and
summons all the powers of philosophy in nature. He refers them to grain
sown in the earth, and its coming forth in a new body. He refers them to
all the various species of flesh, of men, beasts and birds on the earth,
and to the glory of the sun, moon and stars in the heavens&mdash;(all
differing from one another) to prove that God is able to prepare an
immortal body, differing from all these, and raise man immortal! As he
passes on, reveling in the greatness of his strength, and absorbed in the
immensity of his theme, his argument gathers force, till earth and heaven
appear to be in motion before him! He ranges the universe, summons to his
aid the power of God, lays his masterly hand upon every fact, gathers
them in his grasp, condenses them before his hearers, and, in one
overwhelming burst of eloquence, makes the whole bear upon the
resurrection of Christ and of man! He refers them to the coming of his
Lord, at which time will be the end of the Jewish age. Then their
sufferings and persecutions terminate, their darkness, fears and doubts
will be removed, they will be ushered into the glorious reign of Christ,
behold this <i>last</i> and brightest day, hear the <i>last</i> joyful
trump sounding, see the dead by an eye of faith arising, and themselves
as living men changed. These would be Christ's at his coming. Then he
would receive his kingdom and begin his auspicious reign.</p>

<p>No fact is more certain than that Christ was to commence his reign at
the sound of the <i>last trump.</i> Not an instance can be produced,
where Jesus has revealed to his apostles, that any trump was to sound
subsequent to the one, which announced his coming in his kingdom at the
end of the Jewish age. If any one can produce scripture authority where a
trump is to sound at the close of his reign, or at the end of time, or
even produce testimony to prove the end of time, I will publicly and
gratefully acknowledge the favor. Perhaps the 24th verse of the context
will be brought forward for this purpose: "Then cometh the end, when he
shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he
shall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power." This, as it
reads, is no objection to my views; but I contend that this is not a
correct rendering of the passage. Every careful reader will perceive,
that it stands in perfect contradiction with verse 28th: "And when
(notice the word "when") all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall
the Son himself also be subject unto him that put all things under him,
that God may be all in all." This verse teaches a future reign and future
subjection, after the kingdom is delivered up to God. What propriety is
there in saying, <i>"when all things are subdued unto him,"</i> after he
has resigned his kingdom? What has he to subdue, after the kingdom is
delivered "up to God, even the Father". Certainly nothing. I readily
grant, that in the modern edition of the Greek Testament I have before
me, it is rendered in the dative case, <i>"teen basileian to Theo kai
Patri;" "the kingdom to God even the Father."</i> But I perused, several
years since, a short criticism by an English writer (whose name I cannot
recall, nor the periodical which contained it) on this very phrase in
which the author stated that in an early Greek manuscript, he had in his
possession, it was rendered in the nominative case, <i>"teen basileian ho
Theos kai Pater."</i> This would reverse the present translation, and
cause it to read&mdash;<i>"Then cometh the end when God even the Father
shall deliver to him (Christ) the kingdom."</i> The writer however
argued, that as the chapter referred to the general resurrection at the
end of time, it seemed to read far better as Christ's mediatoriol kingdom
would then terminate. This is mere assertion founded upon preconceived
opinions.</p>

<p>I will, however, produce direct authority to support my views. I will
here present the reader with Wakefield's translation of this passage,
whose scholarship will be doubted by none: <i>"Then will the end be, when
God the Father delivereth up the kingdom to him, during which he will
destroy all dominion, and all authority and power; for he will reign till
he hath put every enemy under his feet; and so the enemy death will he
destroyed at last."</i> Here, then, we perceive that instead of its
referring to the end of time, and to the Son's delivering up the kingdom
to the Father, it simply refers to the end of the Jewish dispensation,
when the Father delivered to his Son a kingdom, and when he
<i>commenced</i> his reign. This gives harmony, strength and consistency,
to the whole connection closing with the 28th verse, and is in perfect
agreement with the whole tenor of revelation, which no where speaks of
the end of time. But according to the received translation, he first
delivers up the kingdom to God, then commences his reign, subdues all
things, destroys death, and is then subject to the Father! Let it be
distinctly noticed that this <i>"end"</i> is at Christ's coming. But
where, I again ask, is revealed a <i>third</i> coming of our Saviour?</p>

<p>But again&mdash;The Ethiopic version also supports this rendering of
the above passage, in agreement with Wakefield, which I consider as
sufficient authority to settle the question, at least in my own mind. But
even were there no other authority, than the general tenor of revelation,
I should feel justified in my present exposition. To contend for a
<i>general</i> resurrection, we are in the same predicament with the
orthodox in contending for a <i>general</i> judgment.</p>

<p>The above harmonizes (in my apprehension) with every other part of
divine revelation, which embraces the testimony of the prophets, and of
Jesus Christ and his apostles, who all speak of the <i>end</i> as
referring <i>exclusively</i> to the termination of the Jewish age, at
which time he should come in his kingdom and commence his reign. They
also speak of the glory which should follow, and of the success that
should attend it. But not <i>an instance can be produced, where they
speak of the end of time.</i> He is to destroy the last enemy
<i>death;</i> and this work is effected <i>progressively</i> in this
<i>last day,</i> as individuals are in <i>succession</i> raised from
death, and established in their final and blissful condition affording us
no revelation when this order of things will terminate. If it is a fact,
that God the Father, at the sound of the "last trump," delivered to his
Son the kingdom&mdash;if this be the correct rendering of the passage, as
the whole tenor of revelation seems to justify, then it was at the
commencement of his reign; and our views of the <i>resurrection day</i>
are irresistible. The apostle grasps, in mental vision, the whole
subject, and represents it as one great and interesting event, big with
sentiments of light and life, in the same sense that he does the judgment
of the world, which revolved in his capacious soul as but one single day.
The sudden and interesting change he represents as taking place in the
living, has reference to the unexpected manner in which this sublime
scene would burst on the world. In this he but follows the example of his
Lord, who declared he would come as a "thief in the night"&mdash;that he
would "come quickly," and in an hour they were not aware, and exhorted
his disciples to watch.</p>

<p>We will notice one more passage in the context, which may be urged as
an objection. "Behold I show you a <i>mystery;</i> we shall not all
sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be
raised incorruptible and we shall be changed." The <i>mystery</i>, here
mentioned, refers to the change of those, who should be found alive at
the coming of Christ in his kingdom, produced by the full revelation and
establishment of that doctrine, which proclaims the immortal resurrection
of all mankind <i>by being made alive in Christ.</i> It is the
fulfillment of the following scriptures&mdash;Eph i 9,10&mdash;"Having
made known unto us the <i>mystery of his will</i>&mdash;that in the
dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one
<i>all things in Christ,</i> both which are in heaven and which are on
earth, even in him." This mystery was <i>then finished</i> in the full
revelation of his will to the doubting christians, whom Paul addresses in
the context. This is evident from Rev. x: 7&mdash;"But in the days of the
voice of the <i>seventh angel</i> when he <i>shall begin to sound,</i>
the <i>mystery</i> of God <i>should be finished,</i> as he hath declared
to his servants the prophets." And that he began his reign when the
mystery was finished is certain from Rev. xi. 15&mdash;"And the seventh
angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms
of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ, and he
shall reign forever and ever." Here we perceive that this <i>mystery of
God's will</i> was to he finished at the sound of the <i>seventh</i> or
<i>last</i> trump, which will is, to gather or make alive all things in
Christ. And at this time be was to receive his kingdom and reign forever
and ever. <i>"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"</i>
has reference to those persecuted christians, who were not to "taste of
death till they saw the Son of man coming in his kingdom."</p>

<p>Phil. iii: 20, 2l&mdash;"For our conversation is in heaven, from
whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change
our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body
according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things
unto himself." That this passage has reference to changing our
<i>natural</i> into <i>immortal bodies</i> at the resurrection, I see not
a shadow of evidence to prove, either in established in their final and
blissful condition the passage itself, nor in the context. The context we
have already noticed by pointing out the resurrection to which Paul
desired to attain. Chap. i: 6&mdash;"He, that hath begun a good work in
you, will perform it until <i>the day of Jesus Christ.</i>" Chap. iv:
5&mdash;"Let your moderation be known unto all men. <i>The Lord is at
hand.</i>" "The day of Jesus Christ" and "the Lord is at hand" refer to
his coming at the end of the Jewish age, and not to a resurrection at the
end of time. Paul gave the Philippians notice of no other coming of
Christ. The passage has reference to the change the living were to
experience, at this coming of our Lord in his kingdom, by being delivered
from their persecutions, doubts and fears, perfected in faith, and
"established unblamable in holiness before God," so as to resemble in a
moral and exalted sense those immortal beings in heaven who are here
called the "glorious body" of Christ. The body to be changed embraces
both Jew and Gentile christians, who were at that time to be raised from
their lowly condition into his gospel kingdom and "shine forth like the
sun." This is evident from the manner in which he commences: "For our
conversation is in <i>heaven,</i> from <i>whence</i> we look for the
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our <i>lowly body</i>
that it maybe fashioned like unto his glorious body." He contrasts the
low and oppressed condition of the whole christian body with what will be
their exalted condition at the coming of Christ, and that exalted
condition will assemble that glorified body of beings in <i>heaven</i>
who died in his cause, and with whom they had their conversation, and
from <i>whence</i> they were expecting the Saviour. It has reference, I
conceive, to the body in which Christ arose. The church is the body of
Christ, and it is to be presented to himself a <i>glorious body,</i> not
having spot, wrinkle, or any such thing. The Greek word <i>tapeinos</i>
rendered "vile," should be rendered <i>lowly</i> or <i>humble.</i></p>

<p>It will be noticed, by the reader, that the word <i>body</i> is used
in the <i>singular</i> number and not in the plural, as some have quoted
it in their writings. But if it refer to individual <i>forms,</i> it
ought to be rendered in the <i>plural</i>&mdash;"who shall change our
vile <i>bodies</i>." But it means the whole church or body of
believers&mdash;a collective body of individuals. In this sense the Greek
word, <i>soma,</i> here rendered <i>body</i> is frequently used in the
New Testament. That the apostle does not refer to all mankind is evident
from the fact, that after the vile body is changed according to the
working, he adds&mdash;whereby he is able <i>even</i> to subdue all
things unto himself&mdash;That is, able <i>even</i> to subdue all things
as well as to change that body. If the passage refer to an immortal and
general resurrection, or rather to the change of all the living into
immortal beings, then there would be none to subdue after that period.
But if we apply it to the coming of Christ in that generation, and to the
change of the whole christian body, then all is plain and in perfect
agreement with the preceding and succeeding context; also with 1 Cor.
15th chapter, and with the whole tenor of revelation, which speaks of but
<i>one coming</i> of our Saviour in his kingdom, and which shows that the
work of subjection commenced after the change of the living at the last
trump, whose sound announced the commencement of his reign. The word
<i>kai,</i> rendered <i>even,</i> should probably have been rendered
<i>also.</i> "Who shall change our lowly body&mdash;according to the
working whereby he is able also to subdue all things to himself." The
whole context, however, justifies the above exposition because the
christians were looking for the coming of Christ at the end of that age,
and exclaimed, "the Lord is at hand."</p>

<blockquote>"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive"<br>
1 Cor. xv. 20.</blockquote>

<p>In our last we noticed the context, and also taken into consideration
the language of Paul on the coming of Christ and the change of the living
in Phil. iii: 20,21. This, we have shown, has no reference to the mortal
bodies of men being changed to immortal bodies, so as to resemble the
personal form of Jesus Christ. If it refer to Jesus, still the
resemblance would be <i>moral,</i> not <i>personal,</i> for no where do
the scriptures teach, that we are in our personal appearance to be like
our Saviour. But in a <i>moral</i> sense, "we shall be like him, for we
shall see him as he is." I do not say, that there will be no
<i>personal</i> resemblance between immortal beings and Christ. I fully
believe there will be; but I mean that this personal resemblance is more
a matter of course, than a doctrine of divine revelation. I do not read
of the "glorious body" of Jesus in his immortal resurrection state. But
the scriptures do compare the moral body of Christians on earth with the
glorified body of holy beings in heaven, Heb. xii: 22, 23&mdash;"But ye
are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem, and to an in- numerable company of angels to the
general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in
heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made
made perfect. So far as the Christians were "established unblamable in
holiness before God even our Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ with all his saints"&mdash;so far as they were elevated to "shine
as the brightness of the firmament and as the stars forever"&mdash;so far
as their moral condition and enjoyments were improved and enlarged, thus
far, of course, the <i>lowly body</i> of the church on earth would be
changed into a moral resemblance of that "glorious body" of Christ, who
were praising him in heaven. In <i>heaven</i> the Christians had their
conversation, from whence they were looking for the Saviour, as shortly
to come, and fashion them into a moral resemblance of those saints above,
who had died in his cause, and who were to come with him. From the whole
context, the conclusion is irresistible that this change of the "vile
body" was at the coming of the Lord <i>then</i> at hand, and not at the
end of time, as some imagine.</p>

<p>Another scripture commonly applied to the <i>general</i> resurrection
of the dead, and a change of all the living is recorded in 1 Thess. iv:
15,16, 17&mdash;"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that
we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not <i>be
before</i> them that are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from
heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trump of
God; and the <i>dead in Christ</i> shall rise first. Then we which are
alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to
meet the Lord in air, and so we shall be evermore with the Lord." That
Paul here refers to the coming of Christ in his kingdom to establish his
reign, and to elevate the Christians who were alive at that period, the
<i>preceding</i> and <i>succeeding</i> contexts fully justify. And so I
must understand his language, till some one can prove a third coming of
Christ, and an <i>eighth</i> sounding trump at the end of time. In the
two preceding chapters, he dwells largely upon the persecutions of the
Christians, exhorts them to be faithful, expresses his desire "to perfect
that which is lacking in their faith," and concludes by saying&mdash;"To
the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God,
even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>with all his
saints."</i> No one will deny that this has reference to his coming at
the end of the Jewish age. Now would it not be doing injustice to this
powerful and cogent reasoner to say, that he suddenly drops this subject
without giving his brethren any warning, and runs off to the end of time,
speaks of another coming of' Christ at which he is to raise, at the same
instant, all the dead and change the living to immortal beings? and that
he should again, as suddenly, drop this subject, and hasten right back to
the coming of Christ at the destruction of Jerusalem? To charge him with
this is certainly ungenerous.</p>

<p>After stating that Christ should descend with a shout, with the voice
of the archangel and the trump of God to exalt the dead and living, he
adds&mdash;"But of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write for yourselves perfectly know that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief in the night. For when they shall say peace and safety then
sudden destruction cometh upon them, and they shall not escape." There is
no resisting the conclusion, that <i>"the day of the Lord"</i> in this
passage refers to the same period when <i>"the Lord himself shall descend
from heaven"</i> in the passage above; which must be at the destruction
of Jerusalem. He quotes Christ&rsquo;s own language, Matt. xxiv: 43. Se
also 2 Peter iii: 10. In both places, the sudden coming of Jesus is
compared to a "thief in the night." But where is a <i>general</i>
resurrection, at the end of time, clearly stated, that he had no need to
inform them of the times and seasons, because they already perfectly
knew? Where is sudden destruction to come upon any in that day? For one,
I find no such revelation.</p>

<p>Though the doctrine of immortal resurrection of all mankind was fully
revealed, and established in the world at the coming of Christ in his
kingdom; yet that particular point is not argued by the apostle in the
scripture on which we are commenting. He is not speaking of all mankind,
nor of the immortal resurrection; but as in Phil. iii: 20, 21, so
<i>here</i> he is speaking of the Christians <i>only</i> who should be
alive when that scene burst and of those dead <i>only</i> who had died in
the cause of Christ. "The dead in Christ" cannot possibly include those
who died previous to his birth, but those only who died in the faith of
his doctrine previous to his coming in his kingdom. We might reason this
point at large, but deem it unnecessary till some one proves how those,
who never heard of a Saviour, could be said to die in Christ, or to be
dead in him. I would, however, remark that the Greek preposition
<i>en</i> may be rendered, <i>on account of.</i> The phrase would then
read thus&mdash;<i>the dead on account of Christ.</i> Wakefield renders
it thus&mdash;<i>"they who have died in the cause of Christ."</i> That
this is its true sense, I have not a doubt.</p>

<p>Let one thing here be distinctly noticed: Paul says&mdash;"For this we
say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and
remain," etc. Now where has our Lord ever said, when speaking of the
immortal resurrection, that some would be alive, and be changed to
immortal beings? Nowhere. This single circumstance ought to make every
man pause before he asserts such a change to be true. Read Christ's
language in all three of the Evangelists where he addresses the
Sadducees; and he speaks only of the dead being raised, but not of any
one being changed. Read his language, John vi: 39&mdash;"And this is the
Father&rsquo;s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given
me I should lose nothing, but raise it up again at the last day." Nothing
is here said about changing the living to immortal beings. The Father has
given all into the hands of his Son; and if he is to <i>raise</i> them up
at the last day, then all must die, for the <i>change</i> of the living
is not the <i>resurrection</i> of the dead. How then could Paul tell his
brethren, "by the word of the Lord," that they were to be thus changed?
He could not because there is not a "thus saith the Lord" to support it.
But Paul had the word of the Lord support the change in the living which
we have pointed out. Christ said, "the righteous should go into life
eternal," they "that endured unto the end should he saved"&mdash;that
"they should shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father," and that
"they should be recompensed at the resurrection of the just."</p>

<p>But, inquires the reader, were those who died in the cause of Christ
raised immortal at his coming? No, they were not. It simply means that
they were in that day to receive their elevated stations of glory and and
honor in the gospel kingdom, so much so, as if they had been alive. The
living Christians, in this respect, were not to be before them. Having
suffered and died in the cause of Christ, they were in the minds of the
living to "shine as the stars forever and ever" in the kingdom of Christ,
because they had turned many to righteousness. The Lord had, as it were,
delayed his coming, and many had given up faith in Christ&rsquo;s
resurrection, and were sorrowing without hope over their friends who had
fallen asleep in his cause. They of course had no faith in the immortal
resurrection of their friends, nor in the fulfillment of Christ&rsquo;s
predicted coming to raise their names to unfading honor for having
labored and died in his cause. We are not to understand that those
departed saints were <i>literally</i> exalted to elevated stations in
Christ's kingdom on earth, any more than Christ <i>literally</i> came.
But as Jesus was <i>in that day,</i> at the end of the Jewish age,
"crowned with glory and honor," as king on the mediatorial throne of the
universe, so were his apostles elevated on thrones of glory with him.
Jesus says, "when the Son of man shall sit on his throne of glory, ye
also shall also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel."</p>

<p>Now certain it is, that Jesus did take his throne, when he came in his
glory, at the destruction of the temple. Then it is equally certain, that
the apostles and martyrs also took their's at the same period and in the
same sense. <i>Then</i> Christ came and "his holy angels" and all the
saints came with him; not literally, but in the same sense that he
himself came. Luke ix: 26, 27&mdash;"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me
and of my words, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he shall
come in his own glory and of his Father's and of the holy angels; but I
tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste
death till they see the kingdom of God." I Thess. iii: l3&mdash;"To the
end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God our
Lord even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his
saints." Here we perceive, that he was to come "<i>with all his saints
and holy angels."</i> By his <i>holy angels,</i> we are to understand his
gospel messengers or martyred apostles and by <i>his saints,</i> those
who had died in his cause. These are the persons who are said to be
<i>dead in Christ,</i> and <i>asleep in Jesus.</i> By the words
<i>dead</i> and <i>asleep</i> we are not to understand their present
extinction of existence in contrast with their immortal resurrection, but
the supposed <i>low</i> and <i>disgraceful</i> cause in which they died,
or for which they were put to death by their persecutors, as malefactors.
This <i>disgraceful condition,</i> in which their murderers viewed them
as unchangeably sleeping, stands in contrast with their <i>triumphant
exaltation</i> at the coming of Christ. Their enemies would <i>then</i>
look upon them as having come forth from the dust of the earth and
shining as the brightness of the firmament and as the stars forever and
ever, and not as sleeping in perpetual infamy and dishonor. [See Daniel
xii 2, 3, and John v: 28, 29.] Their enemies (whether <i>dead</i> or
<i>alive)</i> were to come forth to <i>shame, contempt,</i> and
<i>condemnation,</i> which stand in contrast with the <i>glory</i> and
<i>honor</i> to which the Christians (whether dead or alive in Christ)
were to be raised in the minds of the living even to succeeding
generations.</p>

<p>Let it be distinctly noticed that <i>these dead in Christ</i> are not
said to be raised <i>incorruptible</i> and <i>immortal,</i> but only
caught up with the living Christians in the clouds to meet the Lord in
the air&mdash;not <i>literally,</i> but in the same sense that the living
saw the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, so should they see his
saints and holy angels raised from the slumber of infamy, and, together
with the Christians who remained alive at that day, be exalted with him
in the air. [See Matt. xxiv: 30, 31&mdash;Mark xiii: 26, 27&mdash;Luke
xxi: 27, 28, and Rev. i: 7.] In these passages he is represented as
"coming in the <i>clouds</i> with his angels," who "gathered, with a
great sound of the trumpet, his elect," and raised them to honor in his
kingdom. And let me add&mdash;this is all the <i>change</i> Christ has
ever said should take place in the living at the sound of the Trumpet. I
have no doubt that the Apostle had his eye upon the above words of our
Lord when he said, "we shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord
in the air." It will here be plainly seen in what sense those who had
died in the cause of Christ were <i>first</i> raised. They are
represented as coming with him at the destruction of the temple, and
after that event the whole "body" was exalted together. The "vile body"
of Christians on earth (vile indeed in the eyes of their enemies) was
then "fashioned like unto his glorious body" of saints and angels in
heaven who had died in his cause.</p>

<p>That we have given a correct exposition of 1 Thess. iv: 15, 16, 17, is
evident from Paul&rsquo;s words 2 Tim. iv: 7, 8&mdash;"I have fought the
good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth
there is laid up for me a <i>crown of righteousness,</i> which the Lord,
the righteous Judge shall give me at <i>that day,"</i> &amp;c. The phrase
<i>"that day"</i> means not the day of Paul's death, but the day Christ
should appear in the clouds of heaven at the end of the Jewish age. His
<i>crown was merited</i> for having "fought the good fight and kept the
faith." The crown means that exalted honor he should then receive for
having "turned many to righteousness." And not only himself, but all,
"who love the appearing of Christ," should shine as the brightness of the
firmament and as the stars forever and ever in his gospel kingdom among
men. We this day look upon the martyrs and apostles as the lights of the
Christian world and as occupying, on the sacred page, stations far more
exalted than any ever conferred upon the greatest men of the universe.
They are "made priests and kings to God" for dying in his cause, and thus
establishing the truth of Christianity.</p>

<p>This was the "first resurrection," and these were the persons who had
a part in it, which no subsequent christians can ever can have. Rev. xx:
6&mdash;"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection,
on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God
and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years." But if Christ
had not come in his kingdom at the end of the Jewish age, as the prophets
and himself had declared, then the whole Christian system must have
fallen and the names of its martyrs and apostles remained buried in
perpetual infamy as a set of deluded men and impostors. But, blessed be
God, it is not so. They, by their faithfulness, have attained unto the
"first resurrection" and thus broken the dark chains of infidelity into
fragments. This is the <i>resurrection</i> and <i>change</i> referred to
in Phil. iii;: 20, 21, and 1 Thess. iv: 15, 16, 17, on which we have
commented.</p>

<p>We have intentionally omitted till now Phil. iii: 11, 12, as our ideas
will be more readily comprehended here than in our introductory
discourse, where we simply adverted to these words of Paul&mdash;"If by
any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead&mdash;Not as
though I had already attained either were already perfect," &amp;c. Here
we perceive that the resurrection unto which he desired to attain
depended on his exertions in the cause of Christ, and being faithful unto
the end. He says (verse 14)&mdash;"I press towards the mark for the prize
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." But what prize was this?
Ans. It was a <i>part</i> in the <i>first resurrection</i> to which he
desired to attain (verse 11) and he was not "perfect," he feared "lest
after having preached to others himself might be a cast-away." He feared
that he might not endure faithful unto the end. He was well aware that
the promise was&mdash;"Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a
crown of life." To obtain this crown of life in the first resurrection,
was the <i>highest prize,</i> the <i>highest calling of God,</i> ever
suspended upon human merits! Paul did continue faithful, and as he was
led to the thought of death, with composure and satisfaction
exclaimed&mdash;"For I am now ready to be offered; and the time of my
departure" is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a
<i>crown of righteousness,</i> which the Lord the righteous Judge shall
give me at <i>that day,</i> and not to me only, but unto all them also,
that love his appearing." Here we perceive that Paul had continued
faithful, and was entitled to the promised crown, which was awarded to
him, and to all "the dead in Christ," who, on account of their
faithfulness, had a part in the first resurrection&mdash;when he came in
the clouds of heaven to establish his kingdom. It has nothing to do with
the immortal resurrection of the dead, for that is not the reward of
merit, but the gift of God. To <i>that</i> all shall attain who die in
Adam. But in the <i>first</i> resurrection none had a part except those
who died in the cause of Christ, and the living who continued faithful to
the day of his appearing. On them and <i>them only</i> devolved the honor
of establishing the truth of Christianity for the happiness of future
generations, by not only testifying that they had seen Jesus alive from
the dead, but by cheerfully submitting to death, and showing themselves
miracles of suffering in his cause. Both the departed and those that
remained alive, attained to the first resurrection, were glorified
together, and their crowns shall shine in the gospel heavens with
undiminished splendor long after those of kings and tyrants shall be
dimmed and lost in the vortex of revolutions.</p>

<p>He concludes the chapter by noticing the change of the "vile body"
which we have explained. Here then is no evidence of a general
resurrection, nor of the end of time. The <i>context,</i> the
<i>silence</i> of Jesus about the change of the living into immortal
beings, and the <i>whole tenor</i> of revelation combine to set it at
defiance. Of one thing I am satisfied; that no man ever <i>has,</i> and I
believe, no man ever <i>can reconcile</i> the change of the living and
the resurrection of the dead recorded in Philippians and 1 Thessalonians
with their respective contexts, so as to prove a general and immortal
resurrection at the end of time. As I have traveled in an untrodden path,
I do not know but that I may have erred in some minor points, but am
satisfied that my general positions are sound and tenable.</p>

<h2><a name="sermon24"></a>SERMON XXIV</h2>

<blockquote>"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive"<br>
1 Cor. xv. 20.</blockquote>

<p>We have now come to that point in our subject where it will be
necessary to cite a few passages to prove that the immortal resurrection
is <i>successive</i>, not <i>general</i>, and will conclude by
considering some of the principal texts, which may be urged as
objections.</p>

<p>We have already shown that the resurrection of the dead was to be at
the sound of the last trump. And as that trump commenced sounding at the
end of the Jewish age, when Christ came in his kingdom, I deem it
sufficient to establish the fact that the dead are continually rising in
this <i>last</i>, this <i>gospel day</i>. But the question presents
itself--were any of the human family raised immortal before that period?
To this question I give an affirmative answer. I firmly believe, that the
dead have been rising immortal from Adam to the present day, for God has
never changed the established order of the universe. I believe that the
dead are raised without any <i>miracle</i>, in the common acceptance of
that term, as much as I believe that we are born, and die, not by a
<i>miracle</i>, but according to that constitution of things which God
has immutably established from the beginning. I believe this doctrine of
Christ to be founded upon the unchanging principles of philosophy but so
mysterious, that man in his present existence cannot comprehend the
subtle causes and effects by which he shall put on immortality. It was,
therefore, necessary that this sublime truth should be established in the
world by the miracles Jesus wrought and by the miraculous power of God in
raising him from death. The first man Adam was made by a miracle, while
his posterity are naturally born into life, according to that
constitution of things which God has established. So Christ, the second
Adam, was born from the dead by a miracle, while mankind from the
beginning, have, in succession, been born from the dead according to that
constitution of things which he has established.</p>

<p>On this principle, it may be stated as an objection, that as none of
Adam's posterity could be born till their parent was created by a
miracle, so none of the human family could be born from the dead, till
Christ the second Adam were raised immortal by the miraculous power of
God. This objection is futile unless it can be proved that Christ
<i>creates</i> life and immortality. In fact, it would even then
fail;--because Christ, as our sacrifice, was slain from the foundation of
the world in the offerings made to God in his stead. The atonement, made
by the high priest throughout the whole Mosaic dispensation, concluded by
raising the Jewish nation in figure on his "breast-plate of judgment"
into the holy of holies, which was a pattern of things in the heavens.
The atonement always involved the resurrection. The judgment of the Jews,
for two thousand years, by Moses only pointed out the resurrection of man
in <i>figure</i>, but Christ proved the <i>reality</i> by a tangible
<i>fact</i>, and thus revealed it to the living as the doctrine of God of
which the world had been ignorant. So what the <i>judgment</i> of the
world by Moses taught in <i>figure</i>, the <i>judgment</i> of the world
by Christ teaches in <i>reality</i>. My limits will not allow me to argue
this point at large. I have already remarked, that I believe "<i>the
judgment of the world</i>" expresses the whole reign of Christ including
the resurrection.</p>

<p>We now proceed to notice the Scriptures. Matt. xxii. 31, 32. "<i>But
as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was
spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac
and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the
living</i>." To this Luke adds, "<i>for all live unto him</i>." In order
to make these words of Jesus refer to a general resurrection at the end
of time, all writers have availed themselves of this last clause in Luke
(on which Matthew and Mark are silent) and contend that it means--all
live unto God who in his counsels views the future resurrection as
present. But this exposition by no means satisfies my mind. If Abraham,
Issac and Jacob are not raised--if they are yet wrapped in the
insensibility of death, then God during that period is not their God.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, we would remark, that Jehovah could not be Creator
till something were created by him. He could not be Father till he had an
offspring. He could not be Lord till he possessed property;--neither
could he be God till there were a worshipper. <i>Jehovah</i> is the only
abstract name he could possess, were he solitary and without a universe.
All the other names ascribed to him are relative. The name <i>God</i> as
much pre-supposes the actual existence of a <i>worshipper</i> as that of
father does the actual existence of a <i>child</i>. Remove the
<i>child</i>, and the once doating parent is no longer to him a
<i>father</i>. God is not, therefore, the God of the dead, for as such,
they could not worship him. He is, however, Lord of both the dead and the
living claiming them as his property. Abraham, Issac and Jacob were
therefore alive, and worshipping him when those words were spoken to
Moses, for in no other sense could he have been their God any more than
he was before they were born. The phrase "<i>for all live unto him</i>,"
may, in this instance, embrace only the three patriarchs, as no others
are involved in the quotation. The Sadducees believed in the writings of
Moses only, and it is not at all probable, that Jesus referred to any
persons, not mentioned by Moses, as it would have been no proof to the
Sadducees. His argument is, to prove that the three patriarchs, <i>are
raised</i> according to their own writings, not <i>shall be raised</i>.
Now that the <i>dead are raised</i> Moses showed at the bush when he
called God the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Here we perceive that
"<i>the dead</i>" refers to the three persons whom Moses showed were
raised. He then adds--for he is <i>not</i> the God of the <i>dead</i> but
of the <i>living</i>, for all live unto him--that is, the three
patriarchs <i>all</i> live to him. If the phrase embrace any others, it
must be the living in eternity, not the living in the flesh nor the dead
as such. It would make Jesus contradict himself in the same breath. "He
is not the God of the <i>dead</i>, but of the <i>living</i>; for
<i>all</i> live unto him." To whom does this "<i>all</i>" refer? To the
"<i>living</i>"; not the "<i>dead</i>," for in that case he would be the
God of the dead.</p>

<p>Luke ix. 30. "<i>And behold there talked with him two men, which were
Moses and Elias</i>." The transfiguration of our Lord is recorded also by
both Matthew and Mark, and it is plainly stated that the disciples "saw
his glory and the two men that stood with him." If Moses and Elias were
dead, their bodies crumbled to dust, and their minds in a state of
insensibility, then they were not Moses and Elias who talked with him.
Even if God had represented those two persons by other forms, they could
no more have been Moses and Elias than Adam and Noah. It is
<i>consciousness</i> and <i>memory</i> which constitute personal
identity; and if a conversation was carried on with Jesus by any means
that human ingenuity can invent, while Moses and Elias were wrapped in as
profound insensibility as the dust with which their bodies mingled, then
it could not have been Moses and Elias who conversed with Jesus any more
than if they had never had an existence. Perhaps it may be said that, as
it is called a <i>vision</i> by Matthew, it might have been nothing
<i>real</i>. But as the word <i>horama</i> means a <i>sight</i> as well
as <i>vision</i>, and as the other Evangelists do represent it as an
actual appearance and nothing visionary, it is to be taken in this sense.
Was it not a <i>reality</i> that the three disciples saw Jesus
transfigured, and though in that condition was it not still their
<i>identical</i> Lord? Certainly. Then the vision was so far <i>real</i>,
and I see no ground on which the other personages can be considered
phantoms. Mark says, "he charged them that they should tell no man
<i>what things they had seen</i>," &amp;c. See also Luke ix. 36. Here it
is made certain that it was not an appearance in a dream, but a real and
visible sight of three persons whose names are given. Consequently Moses
and Elias were there as certain as was Jesus Christ. If so, they must
have been raised from the dead, for man can have no conscious existence
hereafter in a disembodied state. The scriptures teach that the
resurrection is our only hope of a future conscious state of being. As to
the translation of Elijah we shall not here notice it.</p>

<p>Phil. i. 23, 24. "<i>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire
to depart and be with Christ which is far better; nevertheless to abide
in the flesh is more needful for you</i>." To depart and be with Christ
must, I conceive, mean in the resurrection world, for in no other sense
could he be with Christ so as to render his condition "far better."
Nothing can be <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> for a man in a state of perfect
insensibility, any more than for a man unborn--Neither could he be with
Christ in such a State, any more than before he existed. Between the
condition of a man in non-existence [pardon the expression] and in life,
no comparison as to enjoyment or suffering can possibly be drawn. The
apostle therefore draws a comparison between his present condition of
conscious existence with his brethren, and his future condition of
conscious existence with Christ which was far better.</p>

<p>That Paul has reference, in the above, to an immortal existence in the
resurrection, is evident from 2 Cor. v. 1, 2, 3, 4. "<i>For we know that
if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
building of God, a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens. For
in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house
which is from heaven. If so be that being clothed we shall not be found
naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not
for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be
swallowed up of life</i>." If the above do not prove that the apostle
expected to be clothed upon with his house from heaven shortly after his
earthly tabernacle were dissolved, then I must acknowledge my ignorance
of his meaning. He desires not to be unclothed so as to be found naked at
the coming of Christ. By this I understand that between death and the
resurrection there is a state of insensibility of several days duration,
while the spiritual body is putting on, and if he died so near the coming
of Christ, that the process was not completed, and mortality not
swallowed up of life, he would be found naked, i.e. in the state of the
dead. He therefore expresses no desire to be found unclothed at that
period but clothed upon and present with Christ. This is evident from
verses 6, and 7. "<i>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that
whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. We are
confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and
present with the Lord</i>." While in the body, though they had many
consolations in the faith of Christ, though "he was with them always even
unto the end of the age," though "to live was Christ," yet this condition
he terms being <i>absent</i> from the Lord in comparison to being
<i>present</i> with him, which cannot mean in the unclothed state of
insensibility, but where "mortality is swallowed up of life."</p>

<p>Let it be distinctly noticed, that the apostle is speaking of three
states--1st. as being in this earthly house or body where they were
absent from the Lord--2nd. as being unclothed and found naked at his
coming for which they had no desire--3d. as being absent from the body
and present with the Lord where they should be clothed upon with their
house from heaven that mortality might be swallowed up of life, for which
they had a desire. Verse 9. "<i>Wherefore we labor that whether present
or absent we may be accepted of him</i>." Here we perceive that they did
not labor to obtain entrance into his presence, because the immortal
resurrection is the gift of God. But they labored, whether <i>alive</i>
on earth or <i>immortal</i> in heaven, that they might be accepted among
those, who were worthy to obtain a crown of righteousness in the first
resurrection for having continued faithful unto the end--that they might
he worthy to form a part of that glorious body of witnesses in heaven who
were slain for the testimony of Jesus. And the body of christians on
earth, who continued faithful to the coming of Christ, were to be
fashioned like those above, and receive the same exalted honor in his
gospel kingdom, and the whole compose one bright body of infallible
witnesses, whose testimony can never he shaken by all the powers
infidelity. "To depart and be with Christ which is far better" must mean
in an immortal existence.</p>

<p>We cannot, for want of room, argue this part of our subject at
large;--but the above is in perfect agreement with the philosophy of St.
Paul, (1. Cor. 15,) where he compares the raising of the spiritual body
to a grain of wheat sown in the earth. I would not be understood to say
that this natural body of flesh and blood is ever to rise. No one, I
presume, will contend that infants, youth and decrepid age, and those who
are born deformed will be raised in that condition and all retain their
various complexions. I believe, however, that there are those subtle
materials in the natural body which, when extricated from the earthly
tenement, and completely developed, shall produce the immortal being; and
that these are as perfect in the infant as in the man.</p>

<p>We will now conclude by anticipating and answering one or two
principal objections. It may be objected that, if any one arose immortal
before Christ, he could not have been "the first-born from the dead" as
stated in Col. i. 18. This does not mean <i>first</i> in the order of
time, but in <i>rank</i>. It means <i>principal</i>, and is explained by
the connecting phrase--"that in all things he might have the
<i>pre-eminence</i>." It is more particularly explained in Rev. i. 5.
"Jesus Christ the faithful witness and the first-begotten of the dead and
the Prince of the kings of the earth." In connexion with this, we will
introduce 1 Cor. xv. 20. "But now is Christ risen from the dead and
become <i>first-fruits</i> of them that slept." This also has reference
to <i>rank</i> and not to <i>first</i> in the order of time. In evidence
of this, we will quote Cruden,--"The day after the feast of the Passover,
they brought a sheaf into the temple the <i>first-fruits</i> of the
barley-harvest. The sheaf was threshed in the court, and of the grain
that came out they took a full homer; i.e. about three pints. After it
had been well winnowed, parched and bruised, they sprinkled over it a log
of oil; i.e. near a pint. They added to it a handful of incense; and the
priest that received this offering shook it before the Lord towards the
four quarters of the world; he cast part of it upon the altar and the
rest was his own. After this every one might begin their harvest. This
was offered in the name of the whole nation, and by <i>this</i> the
harvest was sanctified unto them."</p>

<p>Here let the question be asked--Was this sheaf called the
<i>first-fruits</i> because it was ripe before the whole harvest? No; it
was not cut till the harvest was ripe. Was it called <i>first</i> because
the harvest would be <i>second</i> in following it to the temple to be
presented to God, by the priest, in the presence of the people? No; it
was not to be carried to the temple, nor would the priest or the people
ever see the whole harvest thus dedicated to God. But it was called "the
<i>first</i> of the ripe fruits," because it was offered to God in the
presence of the people as an evidence of the consecration of the whole
harvest throughout the nation. It was <i>first</i> in distinction, or
<i>importance</i> without any allusion whatever to <i>first</i> in the
order of time.</p>

<p>So "Christ was the <i>chosen</i> of God, the <i>elect precious</i>,
and the <i>Son</i> consecrated forevermore." He was "the chief among ten
thousand" and proved to be the Son of God with power by a resurrection
from the dead without seeing corruption. In this condition he was
presented to the people as an evidence of the resurrection and
consecration of all mankind. In this he was <i>first</i> and
<i>last</i>--that is, the <i>principal</i>, the <i>chief</i>, the
<i>head</i>, and in <i>this</i> he never <i>has had</i>, and never
<i>will have</i> a <i>second</i> in the order of time. This is no
evidence therefore that he was the first one who ever rose to an immortal
existence. We have positive proof that Moses and Elias were raised from
the dead, an in a state of conscious existence for they conversed with
our Lord in the presence of three of his disciples. They appeared in
glory, and were two as real personages on the one part, as was our
Saviour on the other.</p>

<p>Acts xxvi. 23. "<i>That Christ should suffer, and that he should be
the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light to the
people and to the Gentiles</i>." This passage contains, perhaps, as
plausible an objection against my views as any that can be produced. But
this passage means, that Christ should he the <i>first</i> who should
show light to the Jews and Gentiles through a resurrection from the dead.
The Greek word, here rendered "<i>should rise</i>," is <i>anastaseos</i>
from <i>anastasis</i>. It is a <i>substantive</i>, not a <i>verb</i>.
Professor Leusden, in his Latin Testament, renders it "<i>ex
resurrectione mortuorum"--by a resurrection from the dead.</i> The verb,
<i>to raise</i>, is <i>egeiro</i>, and is six times applied to the
raising of Christ from the dead in 1 Cor xv. <i>Anistemi</i> also means
<i>to rise</i> and is applied to raising the dead to life. But neither
<i>anistemi</i> nor <i>egeiro</i> are used in the verse, but
<i>anastaseos</i>--Consequently it cannot <i>literally</i> be rendered
"<i>should rise</i>," but <i>resurrection</i>. Wakefield translates it
thus--"That Christ would suffer death and would be the <i>first</i> to
proclaim salvation to this people and the Gentiles <i>by a resurrection
from the dead</i>." This is evidently the real sense of the passage, and
I shall offer upon it no further comment.</p>
