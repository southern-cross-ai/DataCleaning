<h2><a id="ch0">FOREWORD</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Carson Napier left my office to fly to
Guadalupe Island and take off for Mars in the giant rocket that
he had constructed there for that purpose, I was positive that I
should never see him again in the flesh. That his highly
developed telepathic powers, through the medium of which he hoped
to communicate with me, might permit me to envisage him and
communicate with him I had no doubts; but I expected no messages
after he had detonated the first rocket. I thought that Carson
Napier would die within a few seconds of the initiation of his
mad scheme.</p>

<p>But my fears were not realized. I followed him through his
mad, month-long journey through space, trembling with him as the
gravitation of the Moon drew the great rocket from its course and
sent it hurtling toward the Sun, holding my breath as he was
gripped by the power of Venus, and thrilling to his initial
adventures upon that mysterious, cloud-enwrapped
planet&mdash;Amtor, as it is known to its human inhabitants.</p>

<p>His love for the unattainable Duare, daughter of a king, their
capture by the cruel Thorians, his self-sacrificing rescue of the
girl, held me enthralled.</p>

<p>I saw the strange, unearthly bird-man bearing Duare from the
rockbound shore of Noobol to the ship that was to bear her back
to her native land just as Carson Napier was overwhelmed and made
prisoner by a strong band of Thorians.</p>

<p>I saw&mdash;but now let Carson Napier tell his own story in
his own words while I retire again to the impersonality of my
rôle of scribe.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch1">I. &mdash; THE SEVEN DOORS</a></h2>

<p class="first">LEADING my captors, but taking no part in the
capture, were Moosko, the Ongyan, and Vilor, the Thorist spy, who
had together conceived and carried out the abduction of Duare
from aboard the Sofal.</p>

<p>After they had reached the mainland, carried there by the
klangan, those strange winged humans of Venus, they had left
Duare to her fate when the party was attacked by the hairy wild
men from whom I had fortunately been able to rescue her with the
aid of the angan who had so heroically defended her.</p>

<p>But now, though they had abandoned her to almost certain
death, they were furious with me for having caused her to be
carried from their clutches back to the deck of the Sofal by the
last survivor of the angans; and having me within their power,
after some one else had disarmed me, they became courageous again
and attacked me violently.</p>

<p>I think they would have killed me on the spot had not a better
idea suggested itself to another member of the Thorist party that
had captured me.</p>

<p>Vilor, who had been unarmed, seized a sword from one of his
fellows and set upon me with the evident intention of hacking me
to pieces, when this man intervened.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he cried. "What has this man done that he should be
killed swiftly and without suffering?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Vilor, lowering the point of his
weapon.</p>

<p>This country in which we were was almost as strange to Vilor
as to me, for he was from the distant mainland of Thora proper,
while the party who had assisted in my capture were natives of
this land of Noobol who had been induced to join the Thorists in
their world-wide attempt to foment discord and overthrow all
established forms of government and replace them with their own
oligarchy of ignorance.</p>

<p>As Vilor hesitated, the other explained. "In Kapdor," he said,
"we have far more interesting ways of disposing of enemies than
spitting them on a sword."</p>

<p>"Explain," commanded the Ongyan, Moosko. "This man does not
deserve the mercy of a quick death. A prisoner aboard the Sofal,
with other Vepajans, he led a mutiny in which all the ship's
officers were murdered; then he seized the Sovang, liberated her
prisoners, looted her, threw her big guns into the sea, and
sailed away upon a piratical expedition.</p>

<p>"In the Sofal, he overhauled the Yan, a merchant ship on which
I, an ongyan, was a passenger. Ignoring my authority, he opened
fire upon the Yan and then boarded her. After looting her and
destroying her armament, he took me prisoner aboard the Sofal. He
treated me with the utmost disrespect, threatening my life and
destroying my liberty.</p>

<p>"For these things he must die, and if you have a death
commensurate with his crimes you shall not go unrewarded by those
who rule Thora."</p>

<p>"Let us take him back to Kapdor with us," said the man. "There
we have the room with seven doors, and I promise you that if he
be an intelligent being he will suffer more agony within its
circular walls than any prick of a sword point might inflict upon
him."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Vilor, handing his sword back to the man
from whom he had borrowed it. "The creature deserves the
worst."</p>

<p>They led me back along the coast in the direction from which
they had come, and during the march I discovered from their
conversation to what unfortunate chance I could attribute the ill
fortune that had befallen me at the very moment when it seemed
possible that Duare and I might easily return to the Sofal and
our loyal friends.</p>

<p>This armed party from Kapdor had been searching for an escaped
prisoner when their attention had been attracted by the fight
between the hairy wild men and the angans who were defending
Duare, just as I had similarly been attracted to the scene while
searching for the beautiful daughter of Mintep, the jong of
Vepaja.</p>

<p>As they were coming to investigate, they met Moosko and Vilor
fleeing from the engagement, and these two had accompanied them
back to the scene just as Duare, the remaining angan, and I had
sighted the Sofal off shore and were planning on signaling to
her.</p>

<p>As the birdman could transport but one of us at a time, I had
commanded him, much against his will, to carry Duare to the ship.
She refused to desert me, and the angan feared to return to the
Sofal, from which he had aided in the abduction of the princess;
but I at length compelled him to seize Duare and fly away with
her just as the party of Thorists were upon us.</p>

<p>There had been a stiff gale blowing from the sea; and I was
much worried for fear that the angan might not have been able to
beat his way against it to the deck of the Sofal, but I had known
that death beneath the waters of the sea would be far less
horrible to Duare than captivity among the Thorists and
especially in the power of Moosko.</p>

<p>My captors had watched the birdman battling his way against
the gale with his burden, but only for a few minutes; then they
had started upon the return march to Kapdor when Moosko had
suggested that Kamlot, who was now in command of the Sofal, would
doubtless land a force and pursue them as soon as Duare
acquainted him with the fact of my capture. And so, as our path
dropped behind the rocky pinnacles of the shore line, the angan
and Duare were lost to our view; and I felt that I was doomed to
go through whatever brief hours of life remained to me without
knowledge of the fate of the gorgeous Venusan girl whom fate had
decreed to be my first love.</p>

<p>The fact that I should have chanced to fall in love with this
particular girl, in the land of Vepaja where there were so many
beautiful girls, was in itself a tragedy. She was the virgin
daughter of a jong, or king, whom custom rendered sacrosanct.</p>

<p>During the eighteen years of her life she had been permitted
neither to see nor to speak to any man other than members of the
royal family and a few trusted servitors until I had invaded her
garden and forced my unwelcome attentions upon her. And then,
shortly thereafter, the worst had befallen her. A raiding party
of Thorists had succeeded in abducting her, members of the same
party that had captured Kamlot and me.</p>

<p>She had been shocked and terrified at my avowal of my love,
but she had not informed against me. She had seemed to despise me
up until the last moment upon the summit of the rocky cliffs
overlooking the raging Venusan sea, when I had ordered the angan
to carry her to the Sofal; then, with outstretched hands, she had
implored, "Do not send me away from you, Carson! Do not send me
away! I love you!"</p>

<p>Those words, those unbelievable words, still rang in my ears,
leaving me elated even in the face of the nameless death that I
knew awaited me in the mysterious chamber of seven doors.</p>

<p><br>The Thorists from Kapdor who formed my escort were much
intrigued by my blond hair and blue eyes, for such were unknown
to any of the Venusans I had yet encountered. They questioned
Vilor concerning me; but he insisted that I was a Vepajan, and as
the Vepajans are the deadliest enemies of the Thorists he could
not more effectually have sealed my doom even had I not been
guilty of the offenses charged against me by Moosko.</p>

<p>"He says that he comes from another world far from Amtor; but
he was captured in Vepaja in company with another Vepajan, and he
was well known to Duare, the daughter of Mintep, the jong of
Vepaja."</p>

<p>"What other world could there be but Amtor?" scoffed one of
the soldiers.</p>

<p>"None, of course," assented another; "beyond Amtor lie only
boiling rocks and fire."</p>

<p>The cosmic theory of the Amtorians is as wrapped in
impenetrable fog as is their world by the two great cloud
envelopes that surround it. From the spouting lava of their
volcanoes they visualize a sea of molten rock upon which floats
Amtor, a vast disk; the occasional rents in the enveloping
clouds, through which they glimpse the fiery sun and feel his
consuming heat assure them that all is fire above; and when these
rents occur at night they believe the myriad stars to be sparks
from the eternal, fiery furnace that fuses the molten sea beneath
their world.</p>

<p>I was almost exhausted by what I had passed through since the
screeching of the hurricane and the plunging of the Sofal had
awakened me the preceding night. After the great wave had swept
me overboard I had had a battle with the great waves that would
have wholly sapped the strength of a less powerful man than I;
and then, after I had reached shore, I had walked far in search
of Duare and her abductors only to have my strength further
sapped by a strenuous battle with the savage nobargans, the hairy
beastmen, who had attacked her abductors.</p>

<p>And now I was about all in as, topping a rise, there burst
upon my view a walled city lying close to the sea at the mouth of
a little valley. I guessed that this was Kapdor, our destination;
and though I knew that death awaited me there I could not but
look forward to the city with anticipation, since I guessed that
food and drink might also await me behind those substantial
walls.</p>

<p>The city gate through which we entered was well guarded,
suggesting that Kapdor had many enemies; and all the citizens
were armed&mdash;with swords, or daggers, or pistols, the last
similar to those I had first become acquainted with in the house
of Duran, the father of Kamlot, in the tree-city of Kooaad, which
is the capitol of Mintep's island kingdom, Vepaja.</p>

<p>These weapons discharge the lethal r-ray, which destroys
animal tissue, and are far more deadly than the .45 automatics
with which we are familiar, since they discharge a continuous
stream of the destructive rays as long as the mechanism which
generates them is kept in action by the pressure of a finger.</p>

<p>There were many people on the streets of Kapdor, but they
seemed dull and apathetic. Even the sight of a blond haired, blue
eyed prisoner aroused no interest within their sodden brains. To
me they appeared like beasts of burden, performing their dull
tasks without the stimulus of imagination or of hope. It was
these that were armed with daggers, and there was another class
that I took to be the soldier class who carried swords and
pistols. These seemed more alert and cheerful, for evidently they
were more favored, but had no appearance of being more
intelligent than the others.</p>

<p>The buildings for the most part were mean hovels of a single
story, but there were others that were more pretentious&mdash;two
and even three story buildings. Many were of lumber, for forests
are plentiful in this portion of Amtor, though I had seen none of
the enormous trees such as grow upon the island of Vepaja and
which afforded me my first introduction to Venus.</p>

<p>There were a number of stone buildings facing the streets
along which I was conducted; but they were all box-like,
unprepossessing structures with no hint of artistic or
imaginative genius.</p>

<p><br>Presently my captors led me into an open square
surrounded by larger if not more beautiful buildings than we had
previously passed. Yet even here were squalor and indications of
inefficiency and incompetence.</p>

<p>I was led into a building the entrance to which was guarded by
soldiers. Vilor, Moosko, and the leader of the party that had
captured me accompanied me into the interior, where, in a bare
room, a large, gross appearing man was asleep in a chair with his
feet on a table that evidently served him both as desk and dining
table, for its top was littered with papers and the remains of a
meal.</p>

<p>Disturbed by our entrance, the sleeper opened his eyes and
blinked dully at us for a moment.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Friend Sov!" exclaimed the officer who accompanied
me.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is you, Friend Hokal?" mumbled Sov, sleepily. "And who
are these others?"</p>

<p>"The Ongyan Moosko from Thora, Vilor, another friend, and a
Vepajan prisoner I captured."</p>

<p>At the mention of Moosko's title, Sov arose, for an ongyan is
one of the oligarchy and a great man. "Greetings, Ongyan Moosko!"
he cried. "So you have brought us a Vepajan? Is he a doctor, by
chance?"</p>

<p>"I do not know and I do not care," snapped Moosko. "He is a
cutthroat and a scoundrel; and, doctor or no doctor, he
dies."</p>

<p>"But we need doctors badly," insisted Sov. "We are dying of
disease and old age. If we do not have a doctor soon, we shall
all be dead."</p>

<p>"You heard what I said, did you not, Friend Sov?" demanded
Moosko testily.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ongyan," replied the officer, meekly; "he shall die.
Shall I have him destroyed at once?"</p>

<p>"Friend Hokal tells me that you have a slower and pleasanter
way of dispatching villains than by gun or sword. I am
interested. Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"I referred to the room of the seven doors," explained Hokal.
"You see, this man's offenses were great; he made the great
Ongyan a prisoner and even threatened his life."</p>

<p>"We have no death adequate to such a crime," cried the
horrified Sov; "but the room of the seven doors, which is the
best that we have to offer, shall be made ready."</p>

<p>"Describe it, describe it," snapped Moosko. "What is it like?
What will happen to him? How will he die?"</p>

<p>"Let us not explain it in the presence of the prisoner," said
Hokal, "if you would reap the full pleasure of the room of the
seven doors."</p>

<p>"Yes, lock him up; lock him up!" ordered Moosko. "Put him in a
cell."</p>

<p>Sov summoned a couple of soldiers, who conducted me to a rear
room and shoved me down into a dark, windowless cellar. They
slammed down and locked the heavy trap door above me and left me
to my gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p><br>The room of the seven doors. The title fascinated me. I
wondered what awaited me there, what strange form of horrible
death. Perhaps it might not be so terrible after all; perhaps
they were attempting to make my end more terrible by
suggestion.</p>

<p>So this was to be the termination of my mad attempt to reach
Mars! I was to die alone in this far-flung outpost of the
Thorists in the land of Noobol that was scarcely more than a name
to me. And there was so much to see upon Venus, and I had seen so
little.</p>

<p>I recalled all that Danus had told me, the things concerning
Venus that had so stimulated my imagination&mdash;sketchy tales,
little more than fables, of Karbol, the cold country, where
roamed strange and savage beasts and even more strange and more
savage men; and Trabol, the warm country, where lay the island of
Vepaja toward which chance had guided the rocket in which I had
journeyed from Earth. Most of all had I been interested in
Strabol, the hot country, for I was positive that this
corresponded with the equatorial regions of the planet and that
beyond it lay a vast, unexplored region entirely unguessed of by
the inhabitants of the southern hemisphere&mdash;the north
temperate zone.</p>

<p>One of my hopes when I seized the Sofal and set myself up as a
pirate chieftain was that I might find an ocean passage north to
this <i>terra incognita</i>. What strange races, what new
civilizations might I not discover there! But now I had reached
the end, not only of hope, but of life as well.</p>

<p>I determined to stop thinking about it. It was going to be too
easy to feel sorry for myself if I were to keep on in that vein,
and that would never do; it unnerves a man.</p>

<p>I had enough pleasant memories stored away inside my head, and
these I called to my aid. The happy days that I had spent in
India before my English father died were food for glorious
recollection. I thought of old Chand Kabi, my tutor, and of all
that I had learned from him outside of school books; not the
least of which was that satisfying philosophy which I found it
expedient to summon to my aid in this, my last extremity. It was
Chand Kabi who had taught me to use my mind to the fullest extent
of its resources and to project it across illimitable space to
another mind attuned to receive its message, without which power
the fruits of my strange adventure must die with me in the room
of the seven doors.</p>

<p>I had other pleasant recollections to dissolve the gloom that
shrouded my immediate future; they were of the good and loyal
friends I had made during my brief sojourn on this distant
planet: Kamlot, my best friend on Venus, and those "three
musketeers" of the Sofal, Gamfor, the farmer; Kiron, the soldier;
and Zog, the slave. These had been friends indeed!</p>

<p>And then, pleasantest memory of all, there was Duare. She was
worth all that I had risked; her last words to me compensated
even for death. She had told me that she loved me&mdash;she, the
incomparable, the unattainable&mdash;she, the hope of a world,
the daughter of a king. I could scarcely believe that my ears had
not tricked me, for always before, in the few words she had
deigned to fling me, she had sought to impress upon me the fact
that not only was she not for such as I, but that she abhorred
me. Women are peculiar.</p>

<p>How long, I remained in that dark hole, I do not know. It must
have been several hours; but at last I heard footsteps in the
room above, and then the trap door was raised and I was ordered
to come up.</p>

<p><br>Several soldiers escorted me back to the filthy office of
Sov, where I found that officer seated in conversation with
Moosko, Vilor, and Hokal. A jug and glasses, together with the
fumes of strong drink, attested the manner in which they had
enlivened their conference.</p>

<p>"Take him to the room of the seven doors," Sov directed the
soldiers who guarded me; and as I was escorted into the open
square, the four who had condemned me to death followed.</p>

<p>A short distance from Sov's office the soldiers turned into a
narrow, crooked alley; and presently we came to a large open
space in the center of which were several buildings, one a
circular tower rising above the others from the center of a large
inclosure that was surrounded by a high stone wall.</p>

<p>Through a small gate we passed into a covered passageway, a
gloomy tunnel, at the end of which was a stout door which one of
the soldiers opened with a great key that Hokal passed to him;
then the soldiers stood aside and I entered the room, followed by
Sov, Moosko, Vilor, and Hokal.</p>

<p>I found myself in a circular apartment in the walls of which
were seven identical doors placed at regular intervals about the
circumference; so that there was no way of distinguishing one
door from another.</p>

<p>In the center of the room was a circular table upon which were
seven vessels containing seven varieties of food and seven cups
containing liquids. Depending above the center of the table was a
rope with a noose in the end of it, the upper end of the rope
being lost in the shadows of the high ceiling, for the chamber
was but dimly lighted.</p>

<p>Suffering with thirst, as I was, and being half famished for
food, the sight of that laden table aroused my flagging spirits.
It was evident that even if I were about to die I should not die
hungry. The Thorists might be cruel and heartless in some
respects, but it was clear that there was some kindliness in
them, else they would never furnish such an abundance of food to
a condemned man.</p>

<p>"Attend!" snapped Sov, addressing me. "Listen well to what I
shall say to you." Moosko was inspecting the room with a gloating
smile on his thick lips. "We shall leave you here alone
presently," continued Sov. "If you can escape from this building
your life will be spared. As you see, there are seven doors
leading from this room; none of them has bolt or bar. Beyond each
is a corridor identical to that through which we just approached
the chamber. You are free to open any of the doors and enter any
of these corridors. After you pass through a door, a spring will
close it; and you cannot open it again from the opposite side,
the doors being so constructed that from the corridor there is
nothing to lay hold upon wherewith to open them, with the
exception of the secret mechanism of that one which let us into
the room; through that one door lies life; beyond the others,
death.</p>

<p>"In the corridor of the second door you will step upon a
hidden spring that will cause long, sharp spikes to be released
upon you from all directions; and upon these you will be impaled
and die.</p>

<p>"In the third corridor a similar spring will ignite a gas that
will consume you in flames. In the fourth, r-rays will be loosed
upon you, and you will die instantly. In the fifth, another door
will open at the far end and admit a tharban."</p>

<p>"What is a tharban?" I asked.</p>

<p>Sov looked at me in astonishment. "You know as well as I," he
growled.</p>

<p>"I have told you that I am from another world," I snapped. "I
do not know what the word means."</p>

<p>"It will do no harm to tell him," suggested Vilor; "for if, by
chance, he does not know, some of the horror of the room of the
seven doors may be lost upon him."</p>

<p>"Not a bad thought," interjected Moosko. "Describe the
tharban, Friend Sov."</p>

<p>"It is a terrible beast," explained Sov, "a huge and terrible
beast. It is covered with stiff hair, like bristles, and is of a
reddish color with white stripes running lengthwise of its body,
its belly being of a bluish tinge. It has great jaws and terrible
talons, and it eats naught but flesh."</p>

<p>At that instant a terrific roar that seemed to shake the
building broke upon our ears.</p>

<p>"That is the tharban," said Hokal with a grin. "He has not
eaten for three days, and he is not only very hungry, but he is
very angry."</p>

<p>"And what lies beyond the sixth door?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"In the corridor beyond the sixth door hidden jets will deluge
you with a corrosive acid. It will fill your eyes and burn them
out; and it will consume your flesh slowly, but you will not die
too quickly. You will have ample time in which to repent the
crimes that brought you to the room of the seven doors. The sixth
door, I think, is the most terrible of all."</p>

<p>"To my mind the seventh is worse," remarked Hokal.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," admitted Sov. "In the seventh, death is longer in
coming, and the mental agony is protracted. When you step upon
the concealed spring in the corridor beyond the seventh door the
walls commence to move slowly toward you. Their movement is so
slow as to be almost imperceptible, but eventually they will
reach you and slowly crush you between them."</p>

<p>"And what is the purpose of the noose above the table?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"In the agony of indecision as to which door is the door to
life," explained Sov, "you will be tempted to destroy yourself,
and the noose is there for that purpose. But it is cunningly
arranged at such a distance above the table that you cannot
utilize it to break your neck and bring death quickly; you can
only strangle to death."</p>

<p>"It appears to me that you have gone to considerable pains to
destroy your enemies," I suggested.</p>

<p>"The room of the seven doors was not designed primarily to
inflict death," explained Sov. "It is used as a means for
converting unbelievers to Thorism, and you would be surprised to
know how efficacious it has been."</p>

<p>"I can imagine," I replied. "And now that you have told me the
worst, may I be permitted to satisfy my hunger and thirst before
I die?"</p>

<p>"All within this room is yours to do with as you please during
your last hours on earth, but before you eat let me explain that
of the seven varieties of food upon this table all but one are
poisoned. Before you satisfy your thirst, you may be interested
in knowing that of the seven delicious beverages sparkling in
those seven containers, six are poisoned. And now, murderer, we
leave you. For the last time in life you are looking upon fellow
human beings."</p>

<p>"If life held only the hope of continuing to look upon you, I
would gladly embrace death."</p>

<p>In single file they left the room by that door to life. I kept
my eyes upon that door to mark it well; and then the dim light
went out.</p>

<p>Quickly I crossed the chamber in a straight line toward the
exact spot where I knew the door to be, for I had been standing
facing it squarely. I smiled to myself to think how simple they
were to imagine that I should instantly lose my bearings because
the light had been extinguished. If they had not been lying to
me, I should be out of that room almost as soon as they to claim
the life they had promised me.</p>

<p>With outstretched hands I approached the door. I felt
unaccountably dizzy. I was having difficulty in keeping my
balance. My fingers came in contact with a moving surface; it was
the wall, passing across my hands toward the left. I felt a door
brush past them and then another and another; then I guessed the
truth&mdash;the floor upon which I stood was revolving. I had
lost the door to life.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2">II. &mdash; LOST</a></h2>

<p class="first">AS I stood there, plunged for the moment into
despondency, the light came on again; and I saw the wall and the
procession of doors passing slowly before me. Which was the door
to life? Which was the door to choose?</p>

<p>I felt very tired and rather hopeless; the pangs of hunger and
thirst assailed me. I walked to the table in the center of the
room. Wines and milk mocked me from the seven cups. One of the
seven was harmless and would quickly satisfy the gnawing craving
for drink that was become almost a torture. I examined the
contents of each receptacle, testing each with my nose. There
were two cups of water, the contents of one of which had a cloudy
appearance; I was positive that the other was the one unpoisoned
liquid.</p>

<p>I lifted it in my hands. My parched throat begged for one
little drink. I raised the cup to my lips, and then doubts
assailed me. While there was a single remote chance for life I
must not risk death. Resolutely I replaced the cup upon the
table.</p>

<p>Glancing about the room, I saw a chair and a couch in the
shadows against the wall beyond the table; at least, if I could
not eat nor drink, I could rest and, perhaps, sleep. I would rob
my captors of the fulfillment of their expectations as long as
possible, and with this idea in mind I approached the couch.</p>

<p>The light in the room was poor, but as I was about to throw
myself upon the couch it was sufficient to enable me to discern
that its bed was composed of needle-sharp metal spikes, and my
vision of restful sleep was dispelled. An examination of the
chair revealed the fact that it was similarly barbed.</p>

<p>What ingenious fiendishness the Thorists had displayed in the
conception of this room and its appurtenances! There was nothing
about it that I might use that was not feral, with the single
exception of the floor; and I was so tired as I stretched myself
at full length upon it that for the moment it seemed a luxurious
couch.</p>

<p>It is true that the discomfort of its hardness became more and
more appreciable; yet, so exhausted was I, I was upon the verge
of sleep, half dozing, when I felt something touch my naked
back&mdash;something cold and clammy.</p>

<p>Instantly apprehending some new and devilish form of torture,
I sprang to my feet. Upon the floor, wriggling and writhing
toward me, were snakes of all kinds and sizes, many of them
unearthly reptiles of horrifying appearance&mdash;snakes with
saber-like fangs, snakes with horns, snakes with ears, snakes of
blue, of red, of green, of white, of purple. They were coming
from holes near the bottom of the wall, spreading out across the
floor as though they were seeking what they might
devour&mdash;seeking me.</p>

<p>Now even the floor, that I had considered my sole remaining
hope, was denied me. I sprang to the table top amidst the
poisoned food and drink, and there I squatted watching the
hideous reptiles squirming about.</p>

<p>Suddenly the food began to tempt me, but now for a reason
apart from hunger. I saw in it escape from the hopelessness and
torture of my situation. What chance had I for life? My captors
had known, when they put me in here, that I would never come out
alive. What a vain and foolish thing was hope under such
circumstances!</p>

<p>I thought of Duare; and I asked myself, what of her? Even were
I to escape through some miracle, what chance had I of ever
seeing Duare again? I, who could not even guess the direction in
which lay Vepaja, the land of her people, the land to which
Kamlot was most assuredly returning her even now.</p>

<p>I had harbored a half, faint-hearted hope immediately after my
capture that Kamlot would land the fighting crew of the Sofal in
an attempt to rescue me; but I had long since abandoned it, for I
knew that his first duty was to Duare, the daughter of his king;
and that no consideration would tempt him to delay an instant the
return voyage to Vepaja.</p>

<p>As, immersed in thought, I watched the snakes, there came
faintly to my ears what sounded like a woman's scream; and I
wondered, indifferently, what new horror was occurring in this
hateful city. Whatever it was, I could neither know nor prevent;
and so it made little impression upon me, especially in view of a
sudden, new interest in the snakes.</p>

<p><br>One of the larger of them, a great, hideous creature some
twenty feet in length, had raised his head to the level of the
table and was watching me with its lidless, staring eyes. It
seemed to me that I could almost read that dim, reptilian brain
reacting to the presence of food.</p>

<p>It laid its head flat upon the table; and, its body undulating
slowly, it glided toward me across the table top.</p>

<p>I glanced quickly about the room, vainly seeking some avenue
of escape. There, evenly spaced in the periphery of the chamber,
were the seven doors, stationary now; for the floor had ceased to
revolve shortly after the light had come on again. Behind one of
those identical doors lay life; behind each of the other six,
death. Upon the floor, between them and me, were the snakes. They
had not distributed themselves evenly over the entire area of the
flagging. There were spaces across which one might run swiftly
without encountering more than an occasional reptile; yet a
single one, were it venomous, would be as fatal as a score of
them; and I was harassed by knowledge of my ignorance of the
nature of a single one of the numerous species represented.</p>

<p>The hideous head of the serpent that had raised itself to the
table top was gliding slowly toward me; the greater part of its
length extended along the floor, moved in undulating waves as it
crept after the head. As yet it had given no indication of the
method of its attack. I did not know if it might be expected to
strike first with poison fangs, to crush within its constricting
folds, or merely to seize in widespread jaws and swallow as I had
seen snakes, in my boyhood, swallowing frogs and birds. In any
event the outlook was far from pleasing.</p>

<p>I shot a quick glance toward the doors. Should I risk all on a
single cast of the die with fate?</p>

<p>The repulsive head was moving closer and closer to me; I
turned away from it, determined to run for the door the way to
which was clearest of snakes. As I glanced quickly about the room
I saw a comparatively open avenue leading toward a door just
beyond the spiked couch and chair.</p>

<p>One door was as good as another&mdash;I had one chance in
seven! And there was no way to differentiate one door from
another. Life might lie behind this door, or death. Here was, at
least, a chance. To remain where I was, the certain prey of that
hideous reptile, offered no chance whatever.</p>

<p>I have always enjoyed more than my share of the lucky "breaks"
of life, and now something seemed to tell me that fate was
driving me toward the one door beyond which lay life and liberty.
So it was with the optimism of almost assured success that I
leaped from the table and the yawning jaws of the great snake and
ran toward that fateful door.</p>

<p>Yet I was not unmindful of that sound advice, "Put your trust
in God, my boys; and keep your powder dry!" In this event I might
have paraphrased it to read, "Put your trust in fate, but keep an
avenue of retreat open!"</p>

<p>I knew that the doors swung outward from the circular room and
that once I had passed through one of them and it had closed
behind me there could be no returning. But how could I circumvent
this?</p>

<p>All this that I take so long to tell occupied but a few
seconds. I ran swiftly across the room, eluding the one or two
snakes that were in my path; but I could not be unaware of the
hissing and screaming that arose about me nor fail to see the
snakes writhing and wriggling forward to intercept or pursue
me.</p>

<p>What prompted me to seize the spiked chair as I passed it I do
not know&mdash;the idea seemed to come to me like an inspiration.
Perhaps, subconsciously, I hoped to use it as a weapon of
defense; but it was not thus that it was to serve me.</p>

<p>As the nearer snakes were closing upon me I reached the door.
There was no time now for further deliberation. I pushed the door
open and stepped into the gloomy corridor beyond. It was exactly
like the corridor through which I had been brought to the room of
the seven doors. Hope sprang high within my breast, but I braced
the door open with the spiked chair&mdash;I was keeping my powder
dry!</p>

<p>I had taken but a few steps beyond the doorway when my blood
was frozen by the most terrifying roar that I have ever heard,
and in the gloom ahead I saw two blazing balls of fire. I had
opened the door of the fifth corridor that led to the lair of the
tharban!</p>

<p>I did not hesitate. I <i>knew</i> that death awaited me in the
darkness of that gloomy hole. No, it was not awaiting me; it was
coming charging toward me. I turned and fled for the temporary
safety that the light and space of the larger room would give me,
and as I passed through the doorway I sought to snatch the chair
away and let the door close in the face of the savage beast that
was pursuing me. But something went wrong. The door, impelled by
a powerful spring, closed too quickly&mdash;before I could drag
the chair out of the way, wedging it tightly so that I could not
free it; and there it stuck, holding the door half open.</p>

<p>I had been in tight places before, but nothing like this.
Before me were the snakes and, dominating them, the huge creature
that had sought me on the table; behind me was the roaring
tharban. And now the only haven that I could think of was that
very table top from which I had so thankfully escaped a few
seconds before.</p>

<p>To the right of the doorway was a small open space in which
there were no snakes; and, hurdling those hissing and striking at
me from the threshold, I leaped to it at the very instant that
the tharban sprang into the room.</p>

<p>For the instant I was held in the power of a single
urge&mdash;to reach the top of the table. How futile and foolish
the idea may have been did not occur to me; my mind clung to it
to the effacement of all other thoughts. And perhaps because of
my very singleness of purpose I would have reached my goal in any
event, but when I stood again among the dishes and cups of
poisoned food and drink and turned to face my fate I saw that
another factor had intervened to save me for the moment and
permit me to attain the questionable sanctuary of the table
top.</p>

<p>Halfway between the door and the table the tharban, a
fighting, rearing, roaring monster, was being set upon by the
snakes. He snapped and struck and clawed, ripping them to pieces,
tearing them in halves; but still they came for him, hissing,
striking, entwining. Bodies cut in two, heads severed still
sought to reach him; and from all parts of the room came ten to
replace each that he disposed of.</p>

<p><br>Immense and threatening, standing out above them all,
rose the huge reptile that had sought to devour me; and the
tharban seemed to realize that in this creature lay a foe worthy
of its mettle, for while he brushed away the lesser snakes with
irritable contempt, he always faced the great one and launched
his most vicious attacks against it. But of what avail! With
lightning-like movements the sinuous coils darted hither and
thither, eluding every blow like some practiced boxer and
striking with terrific force at every opening, burying its fangs
deep in the bloody flesh of the tharban.</p>

<p>The roars and screams of the carnivore mingled with the hisses
of the reptiles to produce the most horrid din that the mind of
man might imagine, or at least so it seemed to me, cooped up in
this awful room filled with implacable engines of death.</p>

<p>Which would win this struggle of the Titans? What difference
could it make to me other than the difference as to which belly I
should eventually fill? Yet I could not help watch the encounter
with the excited interest of a disinterested spectator at some
test of strength and skill.</p>

<p>It was a bloody encounter, but the blood was all that of the
tharban and the lesser snakes. The huge creature that was
championing my cause that it might later devour me was so far
unscathed. How it manipulated its huge body with sufficient
quickness to avoid the savage rushes of the tharban is quite
beyond me, though perhaps an explanation lies in the fact that it
usually met a charge with a terrific blow of its head that sent
the tharban reeling back half stunned and with a new wound.</p>

<p>Presently the tharban ceased its offensive and began to back
away. I watched the weaving, undulating head of the great snake
following every move of its antagonist. The lesser snakes swarmed
over the body of the tharban; it seemed not to notice them. Then,
suddenly, it wheeled and sprang for the entrance to the corridor
that led to its lair.</p>

<p>This, evidently, was the very thing for which the snake had
been waiting. It lay half coiled where it had been fighting; and
now like a giant spring suddenly released it shot through the
air; and, so quickly that I could scarcely perceive the action,
it wrapped a dozen coils about the body of the tharban, raised
its gaping jaws above the back of the beast's neck, and
struck!</p>

<p>A horrible scream burst from the distended jaws of the
stricken carnivore as the coils tightened suddenly about it, then
it was limp.</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief as I thought for how long an
entire tharban might satisfy the hunger of this twenty foot snake
and distract its mind from other sources of food supply, and as I
anticipated this respite the mighty victor unwound its coils from
about the body of its victim and turned its head slowly in my
direction.</p>

<p>I gazed spellbound for a moment into those cold, lidless eyes,
then I was horror-stricken as I saw the creature gliding slowly
toward the table. It did not move swiftly as in battle, but very
slowly. There was a seemingly predetermined finality, an
inevitableness, in that undulating approach that was almost
paralyzing in its frightfulness.</p>

<p>I saw it raise its head to the level of the table top; I saw
the head glide among the dishes toward me. I could stand it no
longer. I turned to run&mdash;where, made no
difference&mdash;anywhere, if only the length of the room, to get
away even for a moment from the cold glitter of those baleful
eyes. As I turned, two things happened: I heard again,
faintly, the screams of a woman; and my face struck the noose
dangling from the dense shadows of the rafters.</p>

<p>The screams made little impression upon me, but the noose gave
birth to a new thought&mdash;not the thought that it was placed
there to arouse, but another. It suggested an avenue of momentary
escape from the snakes; nor was I long in availing myself of
it.</p>

<p>I felt the snout of the snake touch my bare leg as I sprang
upward and seized the rope above the noose; I heard a loud hiss
of rage as I clambered, hand over hand, toward the gloomy shadows
where I hoped to find at least temporary refuge.</p>

<p>The upper end of the rope was fastened to a metal eye-bolt set
in a great beam. Onto this beam I clambered and looked down. The
mighty serpent was hissing and writhing below me. He had raised a
third of his body upward and was endeavoring to coil about the
dangling rope and follow me upward, but it swung away and eluded
his efforts.</p>

<p>I doubted that a snake of his great girth could ascend this
relatively tiny strand; but, not caring to take the chance, I
drew the rope up and looped it over the beam. For the moment, at
least, I was safe, and I breathed a deep sigh of relief. Then I
looked about me.</p>

<p>The shadows were dense and almost impenetrable, yet it
appeared that the ceiling of the room was still far above me;
about me was a maze of beams and braces and trusses. I determined
to explore this upper region of the room of the seven doors.
Standing upright upon the beam, I moved cautiously toward the
wall. At the end of the beam I discovered a narrow walkway that,
clinging to the wall, apparently encircled the room. It was two
feet wide and had no handrail. It seemed to be something in the
nature of a scaffolding left by the workmen who had constructed
the building.</p>

<p>As I took my exploratory way along it, feeling each step
carefully and brushing the wall with my hand, I again heard the
agonized scream that had twice before attracted my attention if
not my keenest interest; for I was still more interested in my
troubles than in those of some unknown female of this alien
race.</p>

<p>And a moment later my fingers came in contact with something
that drove all thoughts of screaming women from my mind. By feel,
it was the frame of a door or of a window. With both hands I
examined my find. Yes, it was a door! It was a narrow door about
six feet in height. I felt the hinges; I searched for a
latch&mdash;and at last I found it. Cautiously I manipulated it
and presently I felt the door move toward me.</p>

<p>What lay beyond? Some new and fiendishly conceived form of
death or torture, perhaps; perhaps freedom. I could not know
without opening that portal of mystery.</p>

<p>I hesitated, but not for long. Slowly I drew the door toward
me, an eye close to the widening crack. A breath of night air
blew in upon me; I saw the faint luminosity of a Venusan
night.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that with all their cunning the Thorists
had inadvertently left this avenue of escape from this lethal
chamber? I could scarcely credit it, yet there was naught that I
could do but go on and chance whatever lay beyond.</p>

<p>I opened the door and stepped out upon a balcony which
extended in both directions until it passed from the range of my
vision beyond the curve of the circular wall to which it
clung.</p>

<p>At the outer edge of the balcony was a low parapet behind
which I now crouched while I reconnoitered my new situation. No
new danger seemed to threaten me, yet I was still suspicious. I
moved cautiously forward upon a tour of investigation, and again
an agonized scream rent the silence of the night. This time it
seemed quite close; previously, the walls of the building in
which I had been imprisoned had muffled it.</p>

<p><br>I was already moving in the direction of the sound, and I
continued to do so. I was searching for an avenue of descent to
the ground below, not for a damsel in distress. I am afraid that
at that moment I was callous and selfish and far from chivalric;
but, if the truth be known, I would not have cared had I known
that every inhabitant of Kapdor, male and female, was being
destroyed.</p>

<p>Rounding the curve of the tower, I came in sight of another
building standing but a few yards distant; and at the same
instant I saw something that greatly aroused my interest and even
my hope. It was a narrow causeway leading from the balcony on
which I stood to a similar balcony on the adjoining
structure.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the screams were renewed; they seemed to be
coming from the interior of the building I had just discovered.
It was not the screams, however, that lured me across the
causeway, but the hope that I might find there the means of
descent to the ground.</p>

<p>Crossing quickly to the other balcony, I followed it to the
nearest corner; and as I rounded it I saw a light apparently
shining from windows on a level with it.</p>

<p>At first I was of a mind to turn back lest, in passing the
windows, I be discovered; but once again that scream burst upon
my ears, and this time it was so close that I knew it must come
from the apartment from which the light shone.
There was such a note of hopelessness and fear in it that I
could no longer ignore the demand it made upon my sympathies;
and, setting discretion aside, I approached the window nearest
me.</p>

<p>It was wide open, and in the room beyond I saw a woman in the
clutches of a man. The fellow was holding her down upon a couch
and with a sharp dagger was pricking her. Whether he had it in
his mind to kill her eventually or not was not apparent, his sole
purpose at the moment seeming to be torture.</p>

<p>The fellow's back was toward me, and his body hid the features
of the woman; but when he pricked her and she screamed, he
laughed&mdash;a hideous, gloating laugh. I guessed at once the
psychopathic type he represented, deriving pleasure from the
infliction of pain upon the object of his maniacal passion.</p>

<p>I saw him stoop to kiss her, and then she struck him in the
face; and as she did so he half turned his head to avoid the
blow, revealing his profile to me; and I saw that it was Moosko,
the Ongyan.</p>

<p>He must have partially released his hold upon her as he shrank
aside, for the girl half rose from the couch in an effort to
escape him. As she did so her face was revealed to me, and my
blood froze in rage and horror. It was Duare!</p>

<p><br>With a single bound I cleared the sill and was upon him.
Grasping him by the shoulder, I whirled him about; and when he
saw my face he voiced a cry of terror and shrank back, drawing
his pistol from its holster. Instantly I closed with him,
grasping the weapon and turning its muzzle toward the ceiling. He
toppled backward across the couch, carrying me with him, both of
us falling on top of Duare.</p>

<p>Moosko had dropped his dagger as he reached for his pistol,
and now I tore the latter from his grasp and hurled it aside;
then my fingers sought his throat.</p>

<p>He was a large, gross man, not without strength; and the fear
of death seemed to increase the might of his muscles. He fought
with the desperation of the doomed.</p>

<a id="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>
<div align="center">
<img src="0300201h-images/LostOnVenus-2.jpg"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">He was a large, gross man.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>I dragged him from the couch, lest Duare be injured, and we
rolled upon the floor, each intent upon winning a death hold upon
the other. He was screaming for help now, and I redoubled my
efforts to shut off his wind before his cries attracted the aid
of any of his fellows.</p>

<p>He was snapping at me like a savage beast as he screamed,
alternately striking at my face and seeking to close upon my
throat. I was exhausted from all that I had passed through and
from loss of sleep and lack of food. I realized that I was
weakening rapidly, while Moosko seemed to my frenzied imagination
to be growing stronger.</p>

<p>I knew that if I were not to be vanquished and Duare lost, I
must overcome my antagonist without further loss of time; and so,
drawing away from him to get greater distance for a blow, I drove
my fist full into his face with all my remaining strength.</p>

<p>For an instant he wilted, and in that instant my fingers
closed upon his throat. He struggled and writhed and struck me
terrific blows; but, dizzy and half stunned though I was, I clung
to him until at last he shuddered convulsively, relaxed, and sank
to the floor.</p>

<p>If ever a man were dead, Moosko appeared so as I arose and
faced Duare, who, half sitting, had crouched upon the cot where
she had been a silent witness to this brief duel for possession
of her.</p>

<p>"You!" she cried. "It cannot be!"</p>

<p>"It is," I assured her.</p>

<p>Slowly she arose from the couch as I approached it and stood
facing me as I opened my arms to press her to me. She took a step
forward; her hands went up; then she stopped in confusion.</p>

<p>"No!" she cried. "It is all a mistake."</p>

<p>"But you told me that you loved me, and you know that I love
you," I said, bewildered.</p>

<p>"That is the mistake," she said. "I do not love you. Fear,
gratitude, sympathy, nerves distraught by all that I had passed
through, brought strange words to my lips that I might
not&mdash;not have meant."</p>

<p>I felt suddenly cold and weary and forlorn. All hope of
happiness was crushed in my breast. I turned away from her. I no
longer cared what happened to me. But only for an instant did
this mood possess me. No matter whether she loved me or not, my
duty remained plain before me; I must get her out of Kapdor, out
of the clutches of the Thorists and, if possible, return her to
her father, Mintep, king of Vepaja.</p>

<p>I stepped to the window and listened. Moosko's cries had not
attracted succor in so far as I could perceive; no one seemed to
be coming. And if they had not come in response to Duare's
screams, why should they be attracted by Moosko's? I realized
that there was now little likelihood that any one would
investigate.</p>

<p>I returned to the body of Moosko and removed his harness to
which was attached a sword that he had had no opportunity to draw
against me; then I retrieved his dagger and pistol. I now felt
much better, far more efficient. It is strange what the
possession of weapons will do even for one not accustomed to
bearing them, and until I had come to Venus I had seldom if ever
carried a lethal weapon.</p>

<p><br>I took the time now to investigate the room, on the
chance that it might contain something else of use or value to us
in our bid for liberty. It was a rather large room. An attempt
had been made to furnish it ornately, but the result was a
monument to bad taste. It was atrocious.</p>

<p>At one end, however, was something that attracted my keenest
interest and unqualified approval; it was a table laden with
food.</p>

<p>I turned to Duare. "I am going to try to take you away from
Noobol," I told her. "I shall try also to return you to Vepaja. I
may not succeed, but I shall do my best. Will you trust me and
come with me?"</p>

<p>"How can you doubt it?" she replied. "If you succeed in
returning me to Vepaja you will be well repaid by the honors and
rewards that will be heaped upon you if my wishes prevail."</p>

<p>That speech angered me, and I turned upon her with bitter
words on my lips; but I did not utter them. What was the use? I
once more focused my attention upon the table. "What I started to
say," I continued, "is that I shall try to save you, but I can't
do it on an empty stomach. I am going to eat before we leave this
room. Do you care to join me?"</p>

<p>"We shall need strength," she replied. "I am not hungry, but
it is wiser that we both eat. Moosko ordered the food for me, but
I could not eat it while he was present."</p>

<p>"Then I am not quite so objectionable as Moosko?" I inquired
sarcastically."</p>

<p>She surveyed me for a moment in silence before she replied;
and then she said, "No, not quite."</p>

<p>I turned away and approached the table where she joined me
presently, and we ate in silence.There was an abundance of food,
with water, wine, and other beverages; and I fell to upon them
like a famished wolf.</p>

<p>I was curious to know how Duare had come to the Thorist city
of Kapdor, but her cruel and incomprehensible treatment of me
made me hesitate to evince any further interest in her. Yet
presently I realized how childish was my attitude&mdash;how
foolish it was of me not to realize that the strictness and
seclusion of her previous life probably accounted for her
frightened and distant manner now&mdash;and I asked her to tell
me all that had happened since I had despatched the angan with
her toward the Sofal and the moment that I had discovered her in
the clutches of Moosko.</p>

<p>"There is not much to tell," she replied. "You will recall how
fearful the angan was of returning to the ship lest he be
punished for the part he had taken in my abduction? They are very
low creatures, with illy developed minds that react only to the
most primitive forces of nature&mdash;self preservation, hunger,
fear.</p>

<p>"When we were almost above the deck of the Sofal, the angan
hesitated and then turned back toward the shore. I asked him what
he was doing, why he did not continue on and place me aboard the
ship; and he replied that he was afraid. He said they would kill
him because he had helped to steal me.</p>

<p>"I promised him that I would protect him and that no harm
would befall him, but he would not believe me. He replied that
the Thorists, who had been his original masters, would reward him
if he brought me back to them. That much he knew, but he had only
my word that Kamlot would not have him killed. He doubted my
authority with Kamlot.</p>

<p>"I pleaded and threatened but all to no purpose. The creature
flew directly to this hideous city and delivered me to the
Thorists. When Moosko learned that I had been brought here he
exercised his authority and claimed me as his own. The rest you
know."</p>

<p>"And now," I said, "we must find a way out of Kapdor and back
to the coast. Perhaps the Sofal has not departed. It is possible
that Kamlot has landed a party to search for us."</p>

<p>"It will not be easy to escape from Kapdor," Duare reminded
me. "As the angan brought me here, I saw high walls and hundreds
of sentries."</p>

<p>"What makes you hope that you can scale the one or elude the
others?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "I can only try. First we must get out of this
building," I said. "Do you recall any of its details as you were
brought through it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There is a long hallway from the front of the building
on the ground floor leading directly to stairs that lie at the
back of the first floor. There are several rooms opening from
each side of the hall. There were people in the two front rooms,
but I could not see into the others as the doors were
closed. It is possible that all of the rooms are accupied."</p>

<p>"We shall have to investigate, and if there are sounds of life
below we must wait until all are asleep. In the meantime I am
going out on the balcony and see if I can discover some safer way
to the ground."</p>

<p>When I went to the window I found that it had started to rain.
I crept around the building until I could look down onto the
street that passed before it. There was no sign of life there; it
was likely that the rain had driven all within doors. In the
distance I could dimly make out the outlines of the city wall at
the end of the street. Everything was faintly illumined by the
strange night light that is so peculiar a feature of the Amtorian
scene. There was no stairway or ladder leading from the balcony
to the ground. Our only avenue of descent was by way of the
interior stairs.</p>

<p>I returned to Duare. "Come," I said. "We might as well try it
now as later."</p>

<p>"Wait!" she exclaimed. "I have a thought. It just occurred to
me from something I overheard on board the Sofal relative to the
customs of the Thorists. Moosko is an ongyan."</p>

<p>"Was," I corrected her, for I thought him dead.</p>

<p>"That is immaterial. The point is that he was one of the
rulers of the so-called Free Land of Thora. His authority,
especially here, where there is no other member of the oligarchy,
would be absolute. Yet he was unknown to any of the natives of
Kapdor. What proof did he bring of his identity or his high
position?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," I admitted. "But he must have had some credentials."</p>

<p>"I believe that you will find upon the index finger of his
right hand a great ring that is the badge of his office."</p>

<p>"And you think that we could use this ring as authority to
pass the sentries?"</p>

<p>"It is possible," replied Duare.</p>

<p>"But not probable," I demurred. "Not by the wildest flight of
fancy could any one mistake me for Moosko&mdash;unless my conceit
flatters me."</p>

<p>A faint smile touched Duare's lips. "I am believing that it
will not be necessary for you to look like him," she explained.
"These people are very ignorant. Probably only a few of the
common warriors saw Moosko when he arrived. Those same men would
not be on watch now. Furthermore, it is night, and with the
darkness and the rain the danger that your imposture will be
discovered is minimized."</p>

<p>"It is worth trying," I agreed; and, going to the body of
Moosko, I found the ring and removed it from his finger. It was
too large for me, as the ongyan had gross, fat hands; but if any
one was stupid enough to accept me as the ongyan he would not
notice so minor a discrepancy as an ill-fitting ring.</p>

<p>Now Duare and I crept silently out of the chamber to the head
of the stairs, where we paused, listening. All was dark below,
but we heard the sound of voices, muffled, as though coming from
behind a closed door. Slowly, stealthily, we descended the
stairs. I felt the warmth of the girl's body as it brushed mine,
and a great longing seized me to take her in my arms and crush
her to me; but I only continued on down the stairway as outwardly
cool and possessed as though no internal fire consumed me.</p>

<p><br>We had reached the long hallway and had groped our way
about half the distance to the door that opened upon the street,
a feeling of optimism enveloping me, when suddenly a door at the
front end of the corridor opened and the passageway was
illuminated by the light from the room beyond.</p>

<p>I saw a portion of the figure of a man standing in the open
doorway. He had paused and was conversing with some one in the
room he was about to quit. In another moment he might step into
the corridor. Which way would he turn?</p>

<p>At my elbow was a door. Gingerly I tripped the latch and
pushed the door open; the room beyond was in darkness, but
whether or not it was occupied I could not tell. Stepping through
the doorway I drew Duare in after me and partially closed the
door again, standing close to the aperture, watching and
listening.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the man who had been standing in the other
doorway say, "Until to-morrow, friends, and may you sleep in
peace," then the door slammed and the hallway was plunged into
darkness again.</p>

<p>Now I heard footsteps; they were coming in our direction. Very
gingerly I drew the sword of Moosko, the ongyan. On came the
footsteps; they seemed to hesitate before the door behind which I
waited; but perhaps it was only my imagination. They passed on; I
heard them ascending the stairway.</p>

<p>Now a new fear assailed me. What if this man should enter the
room in which lay the dead body of Moosko! He would spread the
alarm. Instantly I recognized the necessity for immediate
action.</p>

<p>"Now, Duare!" I whispered, and together we stepped into the
corridor and almost ran to the front door of the building.</p>

<p>A moment later we were in the street. The drizzle had become a
downpour. Objects were undiscernable a few yards distant, and for
this I was thankful.</p>

<p>We hastened along the street in the direction of the wall and
the gate, passing no one, seeing no one. The rain increased in
violence.</p>

<p>"What are you going to say to the sentry?" asked Duare.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I replied candidly.</p>

<p>"He will be suspicious, for you can have no possible excuse
for wishing to leave the safety of a walled city on a night like
this and go out without an escort into a dangerous country where
savage beasts and savage men roam at large."</p>

<p>"I shall find a way," I said, "because I must."</p>

<p>She made no reply, and we continued on toward the gate. It was
not at a great distance from the house from which we had escaped
and presently we came upon it looming large before us through the
falling rain.</p>

<p>A sentry, standing in the shelter of a niche in the wall,
discovered us and demanded what we were doing abroad at this hour
of such a night. He was not greatly concerned, since he did not
know that it was in our minds to pass through the gateway; he
merely assumed, I presume, that we were a couple of citizens
passing by on our way to our home.</p>

<p>"Is Sov here?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Sov here!" he exclaimed in astonishment. "What would Sov be
doing here on a night like this?"</p>

<p>"He was to meet me here at this hour," I said. "I instructed
him to be here."</p>

<p>"You instructed Sov to be here!" The fellow laughed. "Who are
you to give instructions to Sov?"</p>

<p>"I am the ongyan, Moosko," I replied.</p>

<p><br>The man looked at me in astonishment. "I do not know
where Sov is," he said, a little sullenly, I thought.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," I told him; "he will be here presently;
and in the meantime, open up the gate, for we shall want to hurry
on as soon as he arrives."</p>

<p>"I cannot open the gate without orders from Sov," replied the
sentry.</p>

<p>"You refuse to obey an ongyan?" I demanded in the most
ferocious tones I could command.</p>

<p>"I have never seen you before," he parried. "How do I know you
are an ongyan?"</p>

<p>I held out my hand with the ring of Moosko on the index
finger. "Do you know what that is?" I demanded.</p>

<p>He examined it closely. "Yes, ongyan," he said fearfully, "I
know."</p>

<p>"Then open the gate, and be quick about it," I snapped.</p>

<p>"Let us wait until Sov comes," he suggested. "There will be
time enough then."</p>

<p>"There is no time to be lost, fellow. Open up, as I command.
The Vepajan prisoner has just escaped, and Sov and I are going
out with a party of warriors to search for him."</p>

<p>Still the obstinate fellow hesitated; and then we heard a
great shouting from the direction from which we had come, and I
guessed that the fellow who had passed us in the corridor had
discovered the dead body of Moosko and given the alarm.</p>

<p>We could hear men running. There was no more time to be
lost.</p>

<p>"Here comes Sov with the searching party," I cried. "Throw
open the gates, you fool, or it will go ill with you." I drew my
sword, intending to run him through if he did not obey.</p>

<p>"Why open them now, ongyan?" he asked, hesitating; "why not
wait until Sov arrives?"</p>

<p>"It will save time if we have them open; that is why. Make
haste now, and open them."</p>

<p>As finally, he turned to do my bidding, I heard the excited
voices of the approaching men grow louder as they neared us. I
could not see them yet for the rain, but as the gate swung open I
glimpsed the oncoming figures through the murk.</p>

<p>Taking Duare by the arm I started through the gate. The sentry
was still suspicious and wanted to stop us, but he was not sure
of himself.</p>

<p>"Tell Sov to hurry," I said, and before the man could bolster
his courage to do his duty, Duare and I hastened into the outer
darkness and were lost to his view in the rain.</p>

<p>It was my intention to reach the coast and follow along it
until daylight, when, I hoped and prayed, we should sight the
Sofal off shore and be able to contrive a means of signaling to
her.</p>

<p>We groped our way through the darkness and the rain during all
that terrible night. No sound of pursuit reached our ears, nor
did we come upon the ocean.</p>

<p>The rain ceased about dawn, and when full daylight came we
looked eagerly for the sea, but only low hills and rolling
country dotted with trees and a distant forest where we had
thought the sea to be rewarded our straining eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is the sea?" asked Duare.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I admitted.</p>

<p>Only at sunrise and at sunset, for a few minutes, is it
possible to differentiate between the points of the compass on
Venus; then the direction of the sun is faintly indicated by a
slightly intensified light along the eastern or the western
horizon.</p>

<p>And now the sun was rising at our left, when it should have
been upon our right, were we going in the direction that I
believed the ocean to be.</p>

<p>My heart sank in my breast, for I knew that we were lost.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3">III. &mdash; CANNIBALS</a></h2>

<p class="first">DUARE, who had been watching my face intently,
must have read the truth in the despair of my expression.</p>

<p>"You do not know where the sea lies?" she asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No."</p>

<p>"Then we are lost?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so. I am sorry, Duare; I was so sure that we
would find the Sofal and that you would soon be out of danger. It
is all my fault, the fault of my stupidity and ignorance."</p>

<p>"Do not say that; no one could have known the direction he was
going during the darkness of last night. Perhaps we shall find
the sea yet."</p>

<p>"Even if we could, I am afraid that it will be too late to
insure your safety."</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;that the Sofal will be gone?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"There is that danger, of course; but what I most fear is that
we may be recaptured by the Thorists. They will certainly search
along the coast for us in the locality where they found us
yesterday. They are not so stupid as not to guess that we will
try to reach the Sofal."</p>

<p>"If we can find the ocean, we might hide from them," she
suggested, "until they tire of the search and return to Kapdor;
then, if the Sofal is still there, we may yet be saved."</p>

<p>"And if not, what?" I asked. "Do you know anything about
Noobol? Is there not some likelihood that we may find a friendly
people somewhere in this land who will aid us to reach Vepaja
again?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I know little about Noobol," she replied,
"but what little I have heard is not good. It is a sparsely
settled land reaching, it is supposed, far into Strabol, the hot
country, where no man may live. It is filled with wild beasts and
savage tribes. There are scattered settlements along the coast,
but most of these have been captured or reduced by the Thorists;
the others, of course, would be equally dangerous, for the
inhabitants would consider all strangers as enemies."</p>

<p>"The outlook is not bright," I admitted, "but we will not give
up; we will find a way."</p>

<p>"If any man can, I am sure that it is you," she said.</p>

<p>Praise from Duare was sweet. In all the time that I had known
her she had said only one other kind thing to me, and later she
had retracted that.</p>

<p>"I could work miracles if only you loved me, Duare."</p>

<p>She straightened haughtily. "You will not speak of that," she
said coldly.</p>

<p>"Why do you hate me, Duare, who have given you only love?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>"I do not hate you," she replied, "but you must not speak of
love to the daughter of a jong. You should know that. We may be
together for a long time, and you must remember that I may not
listen to love from the lips of any man. Our very speaking
together is a sin, but circumstances have made it impossible to
do aught but sin in this respect. </p>

<p>"Before I was stolen from the house of the jong no man had
ever addressed me other than the members of my own family, except
a few loyal and privileged members of my father's household, and
until I should be twenty it were a sin in me and a crime in any
man who should disregard this ancient law of the royal families
of Amtor."</p>

<p>"You forget," I reminded her, "that one man did address you in
the house of your father."</p>

<p>"An impudent knave," she said, "who should have died for his
temerity."</p>

<p>"Yet you did not inform on me."</p>

<p>"Which made me equally guilty with you," she replied,
flushing. "It is a shameful secret that will abide with me until
my death."</p>

<p>"A glorious memory that will always sustain my hope," I told
her.</p>

<p>"A false hope that you would do well to kill," she said, and
then, "Why did you remind me of that day?" she demanded. "When I
think of it, I hate you; and I do not want to hate you."</p>

<p>"That is something," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Your effrontery and your hope feed on meager fare."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me that it might be well for me to see if I can
find something in the way of food for our bodies, too.
They cannot subsist on so light a diet as hope"</p>

<p>"There may be game in that forest," she suggested, indicating
the wood toward which we had been moving.</p>

<p>"We'll have a look," I said, "and then turn back and search
for the elusive sea."</p>

<p><br>A Venusan forest is a gorgeous sight. The foliage itself
is rather pale&mdash;orchid, heliotrope and violet
predominate&mdash;but the boles of the trees are gorgeous. They
are of brilliant colors and often so glossy as to give the
impression of having been lacquered.</p>

<p>The wood we were approaching was of the smaller varieties of
trees, ranging in height from two hundred to three hundred feet,
and in diameter from twenty to thirty feet. There were none of
the colossi of the island of Vepaja that reared their heads
upward five thousand feet to penetrate the eternal inner cloud
envelope of the planet.</p>

<p>The interior of the forest was illuminated by the mysterious
Venusan ground glow, so that, unlike an earthly forest of similar
magnitude upon a cloudy day, it was far from dark or gloomy. Yet
there was something sinister about it. I cannot explain just
what, nor why it should have been.</p>

<p>"I do not like this place," said Duare, with a little shudder;
"there is no sight of animal, no sound of bird."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we frightened them away," I suggested.</p>

<p>"I do not think so; it is more likely that there is something
else in the forest that has frightened them."</p>

<p>I shrugged. "Nevertheless, we must have food," I reminded her,
and I continued on into the forbidding, and at the same time
gorgeous, wood that reminded me of a beautiful but wicked
woman.</p>

<p>Several times I thought I saw a suggestion of movement among
the boles of distant trees, but when I reached them there was
nothing there. And so I pressed on, deeper and deeper; and
constantly a sense of impending evil grew stronger as I
advanced. It was as though some terrible thing were lurking, ready to spring. </p>

<p>"There!" whispered Duare suddenly, pointing. "There is
something there, behind that tree. I saw it move."</p>

<p>Something, just glimpsed from the corner of my eye, caught my
attention to the left of us; and as I turned quickly in that
direction something else dodged behind the bole of a large
tree.</p>

<p>Duare wheeled about. "There are things all around us!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Can you make out what they are?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I thought that I saw a hairy hand, but I am not sure. They
move quickly and keep always out of sight. Oh, let us go back!
This is an evil place, and I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Very well," I agreed. "Anyway, this doesn't seem to be a
particularly good hunting ground; and after all that is all that
we are looking for."</p>

<p>As we turned to retrace our steps a chorus of hoarse shouts
arose upon all sides of us&mdash;half human, half bestial, like
the growls and roars of animals blending with the voices of men;
and then, suddenly, from behind the boles of trees a score of
hairy, manlike creatures sprang toward us.</p>

<p><br>Instantly I recognized them&mdash;nobargans&mdash;the
same hairy, manlike creatures that had attacked the abductors of
Duare, whom I had rescued from them. They were armed with crude
bows and arrows and with slings from which they hurled rocks;
but, as they closed upon us, it appeared that they wished to take
us alive, for they launched no missiles at us.</p>

<p>But I had no mind to be thus taken so easily, nor to permit
Duare to fall into the hands of these savage beast-men. Raising
my pistol, I loosed the deadly r-ray upon them; and as some fell
others leaped behind the boles of the trees.</p>

<p>"Do not let them take me," said Duare in a level voice
unshaken by emotion. "When you see there is no further hope of
escape, shoot me."</p>

<p>The very thought of it turned me cold, but I knew that I
should do it before permitting her to fall into the hands of
these degraded creatures.</p>

<p>A nobargan showed himself, and I dropped him with my pistol;
then they commenced to hurl rocks at me from behind. I wheeled
and fired, and in the same instant my light went out.</p>

<p><br>When I regained consciousness I was aware first of an
incredible stench, and then of something rough rubbing against my
skin, and of a rhythmic jouncing of my body. These sensations
were vaguely appreciable in the first dim light of returning
reason. With the return of full control of my faculties they were
accounted for; I was being carried across the shoulder of a
powerful nobargan.</p>

<p>The odor from his body was almost suffocating in its
intensity, and the rough hair abrading my skin was only a trifle
more annoying than the motion that his stride imparted to my
body.</p>

<p>I sought to push myself from his shoulder; and, realizing that
I was no longer unconscious, he dropped me to the ground. All
about me were the hideous faces and hairy bodies of the nobargans
and permeating the air the horrid stench that emanated from
them.</p>

<p>They are, I am sure, the filthiest and most repulsive
creatures I have ever seen. Presumably they are one of
evolution's first steps from beast to man; but they are no
improvement upon the beast. For the privilege of walking upright
upon two feet, thus releasing their hands from the mean servitude
of ages, and for the gift of speech they have sacrificed all that
is fine and noble in the beast.</p>

<p>It is true, I believe, that man <i>descended</i> from the
beasts; and it took him countless ages to rise to the level of
his progenitors. In some respects he has not succeeded yet, even
at the height of his vaunted civilization.</p>

<p>As I looked about, I saw Duare being dragged along by her hair
by a huge nobargan. It was then that I discovered that my weapons
had been taken from me. So low in the scale of intelligence are
the nobargans, they cannot use the weapons of civilized man that
fall into their hands, and so they had simply thrown mine
aside, and so, even though I was disarmed, I could not see Duare
suffering this ignominy and abuse without making an effort to aid
her.</p>

<p>I sprang forward before the beasts at my side could prevent
and hurled myself upon the creature that dared to maltreat this
daughter of a jong, this incomparable creature who had aroused
within my breast the first exquisite tortures of love.</p>

<p>I seized him by one hairy arm and swung him around until he
faced me, and then I struck him a terrific blow upon the chin
that felled him. Instantly his fellows broke into loud laughter
at his discomfiture; but that did not prevent them from falling
upon me and subduing me, and you may be assured that their
methods were none too gentle.</p>

<p><br>As the brute that I had knocked down staggered to his
feet his eyes fell upon me, and with a roar of rage he charged
me. It might have fared badly with me had not another of them
interfered. He was a burly creature, and when he interposed
himself between me and my antagonist the latter paused.</p>

<p>"Stop!" commanded my ally, and had I heard a gorilla speak I
could not have been more surprised. It was my introduction to a
remarkable ethnological fact: All the races of mankind on Venus
(at least those that I have come in contact with) speak the same
tongue. Perhaps you can explain it; I cannot. When I have
questioned Amtorian savants on the matter, they were merely
dumbfounded by the question; they could not conceive of any other
condition; therefore there had never been any occasion to explain
it.</p>

<p>Of course the languages differ in accordance with the culture
of the nations; those with the fewest wants and the fewest
experiences have the fewest words. The language of the nobargans
is probably the most limited; a vocabulary of a hundred words may
suffice them. But the basic root-words are the same
everywhere.</p>

<p>The creature that had protected me, it presently developed,
was the jong, or king, of this tribe; and I later learned that
his act was not prompted by humanitarian considerations but by a
desire to save me for another fate.</p>

<p>My act had not been entirely without good results, for during
the balance of the march Duare was no longer dragged along by her
hair. She thanked me for championing her; and that in itself was
something worth being manhandled for, but she cautioned me
against antagonizing them further.</p>

<p>Having discovered that at least one of these creatures could
speak at least one word of the Amtorian language with which I was
familiar, I sought to delve farther in the hope that I might
ascertain the purpose for which they had captured us.</p>

<p>"Why have you seized us?" I inquired of the brute that had
spoken that single word.</p>

<p>He looked at me in surprise, and those near enough to have
overheard my question commenced to laugh and repeat it. Their
laugh is far from light, airy, or reassuring. They bare their
teeth in a grimace and emit a sound that is for all the world
like the retching of <i>mal de mer</i>, and there is no laughter
in their eyes. It took quite a stretch of my imagination to
identify this as laughter.</p>

<p>"Albargan not know?" asked the jong. Albargan is, literally,
no-hair-man, or without-hair-man, otherwise, hairless man.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I replied. "We were not harming you. We were
searching for the sea coast where our people are."</p>

<p>"Albargan find out soon," and then he laughed again.</p>

<p>I tried to think of some way to bribe him into letting us go;
but inasmuch as he had thrown away as useless the only things of
value that we possessed, it seemed rather hopeless. I had
nothing else to offer them.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you want most," I suggested, "and perhaps I can
get it for you if you will take us to the coast."</p>

<p>"We have what we want," he replied, and that answer made them
all laugh.</p>

<p>I was walking close to Duare now, and she looked up at me with
a hopeless expression. "I am afraid we are in for it," she
said.</p>

<p>"It is all my fault. If I had had brains enough to find the
ocean this would never have happened."</p>

<p>"Don't blame yourself. No one could have done more to protect
and save me than you have. Please do not think that I do not
appreciate it."</p>

<p>That was a lot for Duare to say, and it was like a ray of
sunshine in the gloom of my despondency. That is a simile
entirely earthly, for there is no sunshine upon Venus. The
relative proximity of the sun lights up the inner cloud envelope
brilliantly, but it is a diffused light that casts no well
defined shadows nor produces contrasting highlights. There is an
all pervading glow from above that blends with the perpetual
light emanations from the soil, and the resultant scene is that
of a soft and beautiful pastel.</p>

<p>Our captors conducted us into the forest for a considerable
distance; we marched practically all day. They spoke but seldom
and then usually in monosyllables. They did not laugh again, and
for that I was thankful. One can scarcely imagine a more
disagreeable sound.</p>

<p>We had an opportunity to study them during this long march,
and there is a question if either of us was quite sure in his own
mind as to whether they were beast-like men or man-like beasts.
Their bodies were entirely covered with hair; their feet were
large and flat, and their toes were armed, like the fingers, with
thick, heavy, pointed nails that resembled talons. They were
large and heavy, with tremendous shoulders and necks.
Their eyes were extremely close set in a baboon-like face; so
that in some respects their heads bore a more striking similarity
to the heads of dogs than of men. There was no remarkable
dissimilarity between the males and the females, several of which
were in the party; and the latter deported themselves the same as
the bulls and appeared to be upon a plane of equality with these,
carrying bows and arrows and slings for hurling rocks, a small
supply of which they carried in skin pouches slung across their
shoulders.</p>

<p>At last we reached an open space beside a small river where
there stood a collection of the rudest and most primitive of
shelters. These were constructed of branches of all sizes and
shapes thrown together without symmetry and covered with a thatch
of leaves and grasses. At the bottom of each was a single
aperture through which one might crawl on hands and knees. They
reminded me of the nests of pack rats built upon a Gargantuan
scale.</p>

<p>Here were other members of the tribe, including several young,
and at sight of us they rushed forward with excited cries. It was
with difficulty that the jong and other members of the returning
party kept them from tearing us to pieces.</p>

<p>The former hustled us into one of their evil smelling nests
and placed a guard before the entrance, more to protect us from
his fellows, I suspect, than to prevent our escape.</p>

<p>The hut in which we were was filthy beyond words, but in the
dim light of the interior I found a short stick with which I
scraped aside the foul litter that covered the floor until I had
uncovered a space large enough for us to lie down on the
relatively clean earth.</p>

<p>We lay with our heads close to the entrance that we might get
the benefit of whatever fresh air should find its way within.
Beyond the entrance we could see a number of the savages digging
two parallel trenches in the soft earth; each was about seven
feet long and two feet wide.</p>

<p>"Why are they doing that, do you suppose?" asked Duare.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I replied, although I had my suspicions; they
looked remarkably like graves.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can escape after they have gone to sleep tonight,"
suggested Duare.</p>

<p>"We shall certainly take advantage of the first opportunity,"
I replied, but there was no hope within me. I had a premonition
that we should not be alive when the nobargans slept next.</p>

<p>"Look what they're doing now," said Duare, presently; "they're
filling the trenches with wood and dry leaves. You don't
suppose&mdash;?" she exclaimed, and caught her breath with a
little gasp.</p>

<p>I placed a hand on one of hers and pressed it. "We must not
conjure unnecessary horrors in our imaginations," but I feared
that she had guessed what I had already surmised&mdash;that my
graves had become pits for cooking fires.</p>

<p><br>In silence we watched the creatures working about the two
trenches. They built up walls of stone and earth about a foot
high along each of the long sides of each pit; then they laid
poles at intervals of a few inches across the tops of each pair
of walls. Slowly before our eyes we saw two grilles take
shape.</p>

<p>"It is horrible," whispered Duare.</p>

<p>Night came before the preparations were completed; then the
savage jong came to our prison and commanded us to come forth. As
we did so we were seized by several shes and bulls who carried
the long stems of tough jungle vines.</p>

<p>They threw us down and wound the vines about us. They were
very clumsy and inept, not having sufficient intelligence to tie
knots; but they accomplished their purpose in binding us by
wrapping these fiber ropes around and around us until it seemed
that it would be impossible to extricate ourselves even were we
given the opportunity.</p>

<p>They bound me more securely than they did Duare, but even so
the job was a clumsy one. Yet I guessed that it would be adequate
to their purpose as they lifted us and laid us on the two
parallel grilles.</p>

<p>This done, they commenced to move slowly about us in a rude
circle, while near us, and also inside the circle, squatted a
bull that was engaged in the business of making fire in the most
primitive manner, twirling the end of a sharpened stick in a
tinder-filled hole in a log.</p>

<p>From the throats of the circling tribesmen issued strange
sounds that were neither speech nor song, yet I guessed that they
were groping blindly after song just as in their awkward circling
they were seeking self-expression in the rhythm of the dance.</p>

<p>The gloomy wood, feebly illumined by the mysterious ground
glow, brooded darkly above and about the weird and savage scene.
In the distance the roar of a beast rumbled menacingly.</p>

<p>As the hairy men-things circled about us the bull beside the
log at last achieved fire. A slow wisp of smoke rose lazily from
the tinder. The bull added a few dry leaves and blew upon the
feeble spark. A tiny flame burst forth, and a savage cry arose
from the circling dancers. It was answered from the forest by the
roar of the beast we had heard a short time before. Now it was
closer, and was followed by the thundering voices of others of
its kind.</p>

<p>The nobargans paused in their dancing to look apprehensively
into the dark wood, voicing their displeasure in grumblings and
low growls; then the bull beside the fire commenced to light
torches, a quantity of which lay prepared beside him; and as he
passed them out the others resumed their dancing.</p>

<p>The circle contracted, and occasionally a dancer would leap in
and pretend to light the faggots beneath us. The blazing torches
illumined the weird scene, casting grotesque shadows that leaped
and played like gigantic demons.</p>

<p>The truth of our predicament was now all too obvious, though I
knew that we both suspected it since long before we had been laid
upon the grilles&mdash;we were to be barbecued to furnish the
flesh for a cannibal feast.  The very horror of it fascinated
me.</p>

<p>Duare turned her head toward me. "Good-by, Carson Napier!" she
whispered. "Before I go, I want you to know that I appreciate the
sacrifice you have made for me. But for me you would be aboard
the Sofal now, safe among loyal friends."</p>

<p>"I would rather be here with you, Duare," I replied, "than to
be anywhere else in the universe without you."</p>

<p>I saw that her eyes were wet as she turned her face from me,
but she did not reply, and then a huge, shaggy bull leaped in
with a flaming torch and ignited the faggots at the lower end of
the trench beneath her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4">IV. &mdash; FIRE</a></h2>

<p class="first">From the surrounding forest came the roars of
hungry beasts; but the sounds affected me none, so horrified was
I by the hideous fate that had overtaken Duare.</p>

<p>I saw her struggling with her bonds, as I struggled with mine;
but in the clumsily wound coils of the tough lianas we were
helpless. Little flames below her feet were licking the larger
faggots. Duare had managed to wriggle toward the head of the
grill, so that the flames were not as yet directly beneath her,
and she was still struggling with her bonds.</p>

<p>I had been paying little attention to the nobargans, but
suddenly I realized that they had ceased their crude dancing and
singing. Glancing toward them, I saw that they were standing
looking off into the forest, the torches dangling in their hands,
nor had they as yet lighted the faggots beneath me.</p>

<p>Now I took note again of the thunderous roars of the beasts;
they sounded very close. I saw dim figures slinking amidst the
shadows of the trees and blazing eyes gleaming in the half
light.</p>

<p>Presently a huge beast slunk out of the forest into the
clearing, and I recognized it. I saw the stiff hair, like
bristles. It was standing erect along the shoulders, neck, and
spine. I saw the white, longitudinal stripes marking the reddish
coat, and the bluish belly and the great, snarling jaws. The
creature was a tharban, a huge lion-like carnivore.</p>

<p>The nobargans were also watching it. Presently they commenced
to cry out against it and cast rocks at it from their slings in
an obvious effort to frighten it away; but it did not retreat.
Instead it came closer slowly, roaring horribly; and behind it
came others&mdash;two, three, a dozen, two score&mdash;slinking
from the concealing shadows of the forest. All were roaring, and
the hideous volume of those mighty voices shook the ground.</p>

<p>And now the nobargans fell back. The great beasts invading the
village increased their speed, and suddenly the hairy savages
turned and fled. After them, roaring and growling, sprang the
tharbans (I am abandoning the Amtorian plural prefix, kloo,
in favor of the less cumbersome and more familiar English form).</p>

<p>The speed of the clumsy appearing nobargans was a revelation
to me, and as they disappeared into the dark mazes of the forest
it was not apparent that the tharbans were gaining on them,
though as the latter raced past me they seemed to be moving as
swiftly as a charging lion.</p>

<p>The beasts paid no attention to Duare or me. I doubt that they
even saw us, their whole attention being fixed upon the fleeing
savages.</p>

<p>Now I turned again toward Duare, just in time to see her roll
herself from the grille to the ground as the licking flames were
about to reach her feet. For the moment she was safe, and I
breathed a little prayer of thanksgiving. But what of the future?
Must we lie here until inevitably the nobargans returned or some prowling beast of the forest discovered us?</p>

<p>Duare looked up at me. She was struggling steadily with her
bonds. "I believe that I can free myself," she said. "I am not
bound so tightly as you. If only I can do it before they
return!"</p>

<p>I watched her in silence. After what seemed an eternity, she
got one arm free. After that the rest was comparatively easy, and
when she was free she quickly released me.</p>

<p><br>Like two phantoms in the eerie light of the Amtorian
night we faded into the shadows of the mysterious forest; and you
may rest assured that we took a direction opposite to that in
which the lions and the cannibals had disappeared.</p>

<p>The momentary elation that escape from the clutches of the
nobargans had given me passed quickly as I considered our
situation. We two were alone, unarmed, and lost in a strange
country that brief experience had already demonstrated to be
filled with dangers and that imagination peopled with a hundred
menaces even more frightful than those we had encountered.</p>

<p>Raised in the carefully guarded seclusion of the house of a
jong, Duare was quite as ignorant of the flora, the fauna, and
the conditions existing in the land of Noobol as was I, an
inhabitant of a far distant planet; and notwithstanding our
culture, our natural intelligence, and my considerable physical
strength we were still little better than babes in the woods.</p>

<p>We had been walking in silence, listening and looking for some
new menace to our recently won respite from death, when Duare
spoke in low tones, as one might who is addressing a question to
himself.</p>

<p>"And should I ever return to the house of my father, the jong,
who will believe the story that I shall tell? Who will believe
that I, Duare, the daughter of the jong, passed through such
incredible dangers alive?" She turned and looked up into my face.
"Do you believe, Carson Napier, that I ever shall return to
Vepaja?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Duare," I replied honestly. "To be perfectly
frank, it seems rather hopeless inasmuch as neither of us knows
where we are or where Vepaja is, or what further dangers may
confront us in this land.</p>

<p>"And what if we never find Vepaja, Duare? What if you and I go
on for many years together? Must it always be as strangers, as
enemies? Is there no hope for me, Duare? No hope to win your
love?"</p>

<p>"Have I not told you that you must not speak to me of love? It
is wicked for a girl under twenty to speak or even think of love;
and for me, the daughter of a jong, it is even worse. If you
persist, I will not talk to you at all."</p>

<p>After this we walked on in silence for a long time. We were
both very tired and hungry and thirsty, but for the time we
subordinated all other desires to that of escaping the clutches
of the nobargans; but at last I realized that Duare had about
reached the limit of her endurance and I called a halt.</p>

<p>Selecting a tree, and lower branches of which were within easy
reach, we climbed upward until I chanced upon a rude nest-like
platform that might have been built by some arboreal creature or
formed by debris falling from above during a storm. It lay upon
two almost horizontal branches that extended from the bole of the
tree in about the same plane, and was amply large enough to
accommodate both of us.</p>

<p>As we stretched our tired bodies upon this mean yet none the
less welcome couch, the growl of some great beast arose from the
ground beneath to assure us that we had found sanctuary none too
soon. What other dangers menaced us from arboreal creatures I did
not know, but any thought of keeping wakeful vigil was dissipated
by the utter exhaustion of both my mind and my body. I doubt that
I could have kept awake much longer even in the act of
walking.</p>

<p>As I was dozing off, I heard Duare's voice. It sounded sleepy
and far away. "Tell me, Carson Napier," she said, "what is this
thing called love?"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">When I awoke, another day had come. I looked up
at the mass of foliage lying motionless in the air above me, and
for a moment I had difficulty in recalling my surroundings and
the events that had led me to this place. I turned my head and
saw Duare lying beside me, and then it all came back to me. I
smiled a little as I recalled that last, sleepy question she had
asked me&mdash;a question that I realized now I had not answered.
I must have fallen asleep as it was propounded.</p>

<p><br>For two days we moved steadily in what we thought was the
direction of the ocean. We subsisted on eggs and fruit, which we
found in abundance. There was a great deal of life in the
forest&mdash;strange birds such as no earthly eye had ever gazed
upon before, monkey-like creatures that raced, chattering,
through the trees, reptiles, herbivorous and carnivorous animals.
Many of the latter were large and predacious. The worst of these
that we encountered were the tharbans; but their habit of
senseless roaring and growling preserved us from them by warning
us of their proximity.</p>

<p>Another creature that caused us some bad moments was the
basto. I had met this animal once before, that time that Kamlot
and I had gone out upon our disastrous tarel gathering excursion;
and so I was prepared to take to the trees with Duare the instant
that we sighted one of these beasts.</p>

<p>Above the eyes, the head of a basto resembles the American
bison, having the same short powerful horns and the thick hair
upon its poll and forehead. Its eyes are small and red rimmed.
The hide is blue and about the same texture as that of an
elephant, with sparsely growing hairs except upon the head and
tip of the tail, where the hair is thicker and longer. The beast
stands very high at the shoulders but slopes downward rapidly to
the rump. It has a tremendous depth of shoulder and exceedingly
short, stocky fore legs, which are supplied with three toed feet.
The fore legs carry fully three-quarters of the beast's weight.
The muzzle is similar to that of a boar, except that it is
broader, with heavy, curved tusks.</p>

<p>The basto is an ill tempered, omnivorous brute, always looking
for trouble. Between him and the tharban, Duare and I became most
proficient tree climbers during the first few days that we
wandered through the forest.</p>

<p>My two greatest handicaps in this encounter with the primitive
were lack of weapons and my inability to make fire. The latter
was probably the worse, since, without a knife, fire was
indispensable to the fashioning of weapons.</p>

<p>At every rest I experimented. Duare became inoculated with the
virus of the quest, and fire became our sole aim. We talked about
little else and were forever experimenting with different
combinations of wood and with bits of rock that we picked up
along the way.</p>

<p>All my life I had read of primitive men making fire in various
ways, and I tried them all. I blistered my hands twirling
firesticks. I knocked bits of flesh off my fingers striking
pieces of stone together. At last I was on the point of giving up
in disgust.</p>

<p>"I don't believe any one ever made fire," I grumbled.</p>

<p>"You saw the nobargan make it," Duare reminded me.</p>

<p>"There's a catch in it somewhere," I insisted.</p>

<p>"Are you going to give up?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not. It's like golf. Most people never learn to
play it, but very few give up trying. I shall probably continue
my search for fire until death overtakes me or Prometheus
descends to Venus as he did to Earth."</p>

<p>"What is golf and who is Prometheus?" demanded Duare.</p>

<p>"Golf is a mental disorder and Prometheus a fable."</p>

<p>"I don't see how they can help you."</p>

<p>I was squatting over a little pile of tinder laboriously
knocking together various bits of rock that we had collected
during the day.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," I replied, viciously striking two new
specimens together. A string of sparks shot from the two rocks
and ignited the tinder! "I apologize to Prometheus," I cried; "he
is no fable."</p>

<p>With the aid of this fire I was able to fashion a bow and to
make and sharpen a spear and arrows. I strung the bow with a
fiber from a tough liana, and I feathered my arrows gaily with
the plumage of birds.</p>

<p><br>Duare was much interested in this work. She gathered
feathers, split them, and bound them to the arrows with the long
blades of a very tough grass that grew in profusion throughout
the forest. Our work was facilitated by the use of bits of stone
we had found so shaped that they made excellent scrapers.</p>

<p>I cannot express the change that came over me with the
possession of weapons. I had come to feel like a hunted beast
whose only defense is flight, and that is a most unhappy
situation for the man who wishes to impress the object of his
love with his heroic qualities.</p>

<p>I really cannot say that I had any such intention in my mind
at any time, yet with the growing realization of my futility I
really did come to wish that I might cut a better figure before
Duare.</p>

<p>Now I stepped out with a new stride. I was the hunter rather
than the hunted. My pitiful, inadequate little weapons swept all
doubts from my mind. I was now equal to any emergency.</p>

<p>"Duare," I exclaimed, "I am going to find Vepaja; I am going
to take you home!"</p>

<p>She looked at me questioningly. "The last time we spoke of
that," she reminded me, "you said that you hadn't the remotest
idea where Vepaja was and that if you had, you couldn't hope to
get there."</p>

<p>"That," I said, "was several days ago. Things are different
now. Now, Duare, we are going hunting; we are going to have meat
for dinner. You walk behind me so as not to frighten the
game."</p>

<p>I moved forward with my old assurance and, perhaps, a little
incautiously. Duare followed a few paces in the rear. There was
considerable undergrowth in this portion of the forest, more than
I had encountered before, and I could not see very far in any
direction. We were following what appeared to be a game trail,
along which I advanced boldly but silently.</p>

<p>Presently I saw a movement in the foliage ahead and then what
appeared to be the outlines of some large animal. Almost
instantly the silence of the forest was broken by the thunderous
bellow of a basto, and there was a great crashing in the
undergrowth.</p>

<p>"Take to the trees, Duare!" I cried, and at the same time I
turned and ran back to assist her in climbing out of danger; and
then Duare stumbled and fell.</p>

<p>Again the basto bellowed, and a quick backward glance revealed
the mighty creature in the trail only a few paces in my rear. He
was not charging, but he was advancing, and I could see that he
would be upon us before we could possibly climb to safety,
because of the slight delay occasioned by Duare's fall.</p>

<p>There appeared to be but one course of action open to
me&mdash;I must delay the beast until Duare had gained a place of
safety. I recalled how Kamlot had slain one of the creatures by
distracting its attention from himself to a leafy branch held in
his left hand and then plunged his keen sword behind the shoulder
down into the heart. But I had no leafy branch and only a crude
wooden spear.</p>

<p>He was almost upon me, his red rimmed eyes blazing, his white
tusks gleaming. He loomed as large as an elephant to my excited
imagination. He put his head down, another thunderous roar
rumbled from his cavernous chest, and then he charged.</p>

<p><br>As the basto bore down upon me my only thought was to
divert his attention from Duare until she should be safely out of
his reach. It all happened so quickly that I imagine I had no
time to think of my own almost certain fate.</p>

<p>The brute was so close to me when he started his charge that
he attained no great speed. He came straight toward me with his
head lowered, and so mighty and awe inspiring was he that I did
not even consider attempting to stop him with my puny
weapons.</p>

<p>Instead, all my thoughts centered upon one objective&mdash;to
save myself from being impaled upon those horns.</p>

<p>I grasped them, one with each hand, as the basto struck me,
and, thanks to my unusual strength, I succeeded in breaking the
force of the impact as well as diverting the horns from my
vitals.</p>

<p>The instant that he felt my weight the brute ripped upward
with his head in an effort to gore and toss me, and in the latter
he succeeded beyond anything that I might have expected and, I
imagine, beyond what he intended.</p>

<p>With almost the force of an explosion I was hurtled upward to
crash through the foliage and the branches of the tree above,
dropping my weapons as I went. Fortunately my head came in
contact with no large limb, and so I retained consciousness
through it all. I also retained my presence of mind and,
clutching frantically, I succeeded in grasping a branch across
which my body had fallen. From there I dragged myself to the
safety of a larger limb.</p>

<p>My first thought was of Duare. Was she safe? Had she been able
to climb out of danger before the basto disposed of me and was
upon her, or had he reached and gored her?</p>

<p>My fears were almost immediately allayed by the sound of her
voice. "Oh, Carson, Carson! Are you hurt?" she cried. The anguish
of her tones was ample reward for any hurts I might have
sustained.</p>

<p>"I think not," I replied; "just shaken up a bit. Are you all
right? Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here, in the next tree. Oh, I thought he had killed you!"</p>

<p>I was testing out my joints and feeling of myself for possible
injuries; but I discovered nothing more serious than bruises, and
scratches, and of these I had plenty.</p>

<p>As I was examining myself, Duare made her way along
interlocking branches and presently she was at my side. "You're
bleeding," she exclaimed. "You <i>are</i> hurt."</p>

<p>"These are nothing but scratches," I assured her; "only my
pride is hurt."</p>

<p>"Your pride! Why should that be hurt"</p>

<p>"I was so sure of myself just a moment ago, so self-satisfied
with my new and wonderful weap- onsl and now look at me! disarmed
and glad to be up a tree and safe from the first creature I
met."</p>

<p>"You have nothing to be ashamed of; you should be very proud
of what you did. I saw. I glanced behind me as I got to my feet,
and I saw you standing right in the path of that terrible beast
so that it would not reach me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I suggested, "I was too terrified to run&mdash;just
paralyzed by fear."</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head. "I know better than that; I
know you too well."</p>

<p>"Any risk would be worth taking if it won your approval."</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, looking down at the basto. The
brute was pawing the ground and bellowing. Occasionally it would
pause and look up at us.</p>

<p>"It seems very angry," said Duare. "I wish it would go
away."</p>

<p>"It is waiting for us to fall out of the tree, I should judge
by the way it keeps looking up at us. I wonder how much longer it
will hang around."</p>

<p>"We could get away from it by going through the trees,"
suggested Duare. "They grow very close together here."</p>

<p>"And abandon my new weapons?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot them. Of course we mustn't do that."</p>

<p>"He'll probably go away in a few minutes, as soon as he
realizes we are not coming down."</p>

<p>But he didn't go away in a few minutes. He bellowed and pawed
and gored the ground for half an hour, and then he lay down
beneath the tree.</p>

<p>"That fellow's an optimist," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Why? What makes you thing that?"</p>

<p>"He thinks that if he waits long enough we'll probably come
down of our own volition," I explained.</p>

<p>Duare laughed. "Maybe he thinks we'll die of old age and fall
down."</p>

<p>"That's a joke on him; he doesn't know that we have been
inoculated with the serum of longevity."</p>

<p>"In the meantime, the joke is on us; and I am getting
hungry."</p>

<p>"Look, Duare!" I whispered, as I caught sight of something
dimly visible through the tangled undergrowth beyond the
basto.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but it's something large."</p>

<p>"It is creeping silently through the brush, Carson. Do you
suppose it is something that has caught our scent, some other
terrible beast of prey?"</p>

<p>"Well, we are up a tree," I reassured her.</p>

<p>"Yes, and many of these creatures climb trees. I wish you had
your weapons."</p>

<p>"If that basto would look the other way for a minute, I'd go
down and get them."</p>

<p>"No, you mustn't do that&mdash;one or the other of them would
get you."</p>

<p>"Here it comes now, Duare! Look!"</p>

<p>"It's a tharban," she whispered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5">V. &mdash; BULL AGAINST LION</a></h2>

<p class="first">The evil face of the fierce carnivore was
protruding from the underbrush a short distance beyond and behind
the basto. The latter did not see it, nor did his nostrils catch
the scent of the great cat-like creature.</p>

<p>"It's not looking at us," I said; "it's watching the
basto."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose&mdash;" commenced Duare, and then her words
were drowned by the most blood-curdling scream I have ever
heard.</p>

<p>It came from the savage throat of the tharban at the instant
it sprang toward the basto. The latter beast, lumbering to its
feet, was caught at a disadvantage. The tharban leaped full upon
its back, sinking talons and fangs deep into the tough flesh.</p>

<p>The bellowing of the basto mingled with the roars and growls
of the tharban in a hideous diapason of bestial rage that seemed
to rock the forest.</p>

<p>The huge bull wheeled in a frenzy of pain and sought to sink
its horn in the thing upon its back. The tharban struck viciously
at the savage face, raking downward from poll to muzzle, tearing
hide and flesh to the bone, one great talon ripping an eye from
its socket.</p>

<p>Its head a bloody mass of torn flesh, the basto threw itself
upon its back with almost cat-like agility, seeking to crush the
life from its tormentor; but the tharban leaped to one side and,
as the bull scrambled to its feet, sprang in again.</p>

<p>This time the basto, wheeling with lowered head and incredible
swiftness, caught the tharban full upon its horns and tossed it
high into the foliage of the tree above.</p>

<p class="caption">The basto charged.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>A screaming, clawing hellion of unrestrained primitive rage
and hate, the great carnivore hurtled upward within a few feet of
Duare and me; and then, still clawing and screaming, it fell
back.</p>

<p>Like a huge cat, that it most closely resembled, it came down
feet first. With ready horns and tail stiffly erect, the basto
waited to catch it and toss it again. Full on those powerful
horns the tharban fell; but when the basto surged upward with all
the strength of that mighty, bulging neck, the tharban did not
soar upward into the tree again. With powerful claws and mighty
jaws it clung to the head and neck of its antagonist. It raked
shoulder and throat as the basto attempted to shake it loose.
With fearful strokes of its talons it was tearing the basto to
shreds.</p>

<p>In a bloody welter of gore, the stricken creature, now totally
blinded by the loss of its remaining eye, wheeled in a grotesque
and futile pirouette of death; but still its screaming Nemesis
clung to it, tearing, striking in mad, blind rage, its hideous
cries mingling with the now shrill death bellowings of the
stricken bull.</p>

<p>Suddenly the basto stopped in its tracks, its feet spread
swaying weakly. Blood was gushing from its neck in such a torrent
that I was positive its jugular must have been severed; I knew
that the end must be near and only wondered at the unbelievable
tenacity with which the creature clung to life.</p>

<p>Nor was the tharban in an enviable state. Once badly gored and
now impaled upon those two mighty horns, the blood of his
terrible wounds mingling with the blood of his intended victim,
his chances of survival were as negligible as those of the
weaving bull, already seemingly dead upon its feet.</p>

<p>But how could I guess the inconceivable vitality of these
mighty creatures?</p>

<p>With a sudden shake of his horns the bull stiffened; then he
lowered his head and charged blindly, apparently with all the
strength and vigor of unimpaired vitality.</p>

<p>It was to be a short charge. With terrific impact he struck
the bole of the tree in which we were crouching. The branch upon
which we sat swayed and snapped like a loose spar in a gale, and
Duare and I were toppled from our perch.</p>

<p>Clutching futilely for support, we shot downward on top of the
tharban and the basto. For an instant I was terrified for Duare's
safety, but there was no need for apprehension. Neither of these
mighty engines of destruction turned upon us; neither moved.
Except for a few convulsive shudders they lay still in death.</p>

<p>The tharban had been caught between the bole of the tree and
massive poll of the basto and crushed to pulp; the basto had died
as it wreaked its final, fearful vengeance on the tharban.</p>

<p>Duare and I had rolled to the ground beside the bodies of
these mighty Titans; and now, uninjured, we sprang to our feet.
Duare was pale and a trifle shaken, but she smiled bravely up
into my face.</p>

<p>"Our hunting was more successful than we dreamed," she said.
"Here is meat enough for many men."</p>

<p>"Kamlot told me that there was nothing like a basto steak
grilled over a wood fire."</p>

<p>"They are delicious. My mouth is watering already."</p>

<p>"And mine, too, Duare; but without a knife we are still a long
way from the steak. Look at that thick hide."</p>

<p>Duare looked crestfallen. "Did ever two people have such
continuous bad luck?" she exclaimed. "But never mind," she added.
"Get your weapons, and perhaps we shall find something small
enough to tear to pieces or cook whole."</p>

<p>"Wait!" I exclaimed, opening the pocket pouch that hung over
my shoulder by a stout cord. "I have a piece of stone with a
sharp edge that I use for scraping my bow and arrows. I may be
able to hack out a meal with it."</p>

<p>It was a laborious job but I finally succeeded, and while I
was engaged upon this crude and ragged butchery Duare gathered
tinder and wood and surprised us both by starting a fire. She was
very happy and excited over her success, and proud, too. In all
her pampered life at home she had never been required to do a
practical thing, and the reward of even this small accomplishment
filled her with joy.</p>

<p>That meal was a memorable one; it was epochal. It marked the
emergence of primitive man from the lower orders of life. He had
achieved fire; he had fashioned weapons; he had made his kill
(figuratively, in this case); and now for the first time he was
eating cooked food. And I liked to carry the metaphor a little
further in this instance and think of the partner of his
achievements as his mate. I sighed as I thought of the happiness
that might be ours did Duare but return my love.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Duare. "Why do you sigh?"</p>

<p>"I am sighing because I am not really a primitive man instead
of a poor, weak imitation of one."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to be a primitive man?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Because primitive man was not bound by silly conventions," I
replied. "If he wanted a woman and she did not want him, he
grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to his lair;
it was all very simple."</p>

<p>"I am glad that I did not live in those times," said
Duare.  "I would not like to be dragged around by the hair. If any man tried to drag me by the hair, I would kill him."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">For several days we wandered on through the
forest. I knew that we were hopelessly lost, but I was anxious to
get out of that gloomy wood. It was getting on our nerves. I
managed to kill small game with my spear and my arrows; there was
an abundance of fruit and nuts; and water was plentiful. In the
matter of food we lived like kings, and we were fortunate in our
encounters with the more formidable creatures we met. Luckily for
us we saw none that were arboreal, though I am positive that this
was merely by the luckiest chance, for the woods of Amtor harbor
many terrible creatures that live wholly in the trees.</p>

<p>Duare, notwithstanding all the hardships and dangers she was
constantly undergoing, seldom complained. She remained remarkably
cheerful in the face of what was now palpably the absolute
certainty that we could never hope to find the distant island
where her father was king. Sometimes she was sober and silent for
long periods, and I guessed that at these times she was
sorrowing; but she did not share her sorrows with me. I wished
that she would; we often share our sorrows with those we
love.</p>

<p>But one day she suddenly sat down and began to cry. I was so
surprised that I just stood there for several minutes staring at
her before I could think of anything to say, and then I didn't
think of anything very brilliant.</p>

<p>"Why, Duare!" I cried. "What's the matter? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and sought to stifle her sobs. "I'm sorry,"
she managed to say at last. "I didn't mean to; I've tried not to;
but this forest! Oh, Carson, it's on my nerves; it haunts me even
in my sleep. It is endless; it goes on and on
forever&mdash;gloomy, forbidding, filled with terrible dangers.
There!" she exclaimed, and rising she shook her head as though to
dispel unwelcome visions. "I'm all right now; I won't do it
again." She smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>I wanted to take her in my arms and comfort her&mdash;oh, how
badly I wanted to! But I only laid a hand upon her shoulder. "I
know just how you feel," I told her. "I've felt the same way for
days. I'm only sorry that I can't cry too; it would be a relief.
I have to take it out by swearing to myself.</p>

<p>"But it can't last forever, Duare. There must be an end to it
pretty soon; and, anyway, you must remember that the forest has
fed us and sheltered us and protected us."</p>

<p>"As a jailer feeds and shelters and protects the criminal
condemned to die," she responded dully. "Come! Let's not speak of
it any more."</p>

<p>Once again the underbrush was thick, and we were following a
game trail that was as erratic as most game trails. I think it
was this thick brush that depressed Duare even more than the
forest itself. I know it always depressed me. The trail was wide
and we were walking abreast when suddenly at a turning the forest
seemed to disappear in front of us. There was a void staring us
in the face, and beyond that, far, far away, the outlines of
distant mountains.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6">VI. &mdash; DOWN THE ESCARPMENT</a></h2>

<p class="first">Wonderingly we advanced until we stood upon the
brink of a lofty escarpment. Far below, at least five thousand
feet, a great valley spread before our eyes. Far, far away,
across it, we saw the outlines of the distant mountains that
hemmed it upon that side; but to the right and left its extent
was shrouded in the mists of distance.</p>

<p>During the days that we had been wandering in the forest we
must have been climbing steadily, but the ascent had been so
gradual that we had scarcely noticed it. Now, the effect of
coming suddenly upon this mighty depression was startling. It was
as though I were looking into a deep pit that lay far below sea
level. This impression, however, was soon dispelled, for in the
distance I saw a great river winding along the bed of the valley;
and I knew that it must run downward to some sea.</p>

<p>"A new world!" breathed Duare. "How beautiful by contrast with
this frightful forest!"</p>

<p>"Let us hope that it will be no less kind to us than the
forest has been."</p>

<p>"How could it be otherwise than kind? It is so beautiful," she
replied. "There must be people living there, generous, kindly
people as lovely as their lovely valley. There could be no evil
where there is so much beauty. Perhaps they will help us to
return to my Vepaja. I am sure they will."</p>

<p>"I hope so, Duare," I said.</p>

<p>"See!" she exclaimed. "There are little rivers running into
the big river, and there are level plains dotted with trees, and
there are forests, too, but no terrible forest that stretches on
and on seemingly without end as this that we are escaping. Do you
see any cities or signs of man, Carson?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "I cannot be positive. We are very high above
the valley; and the large river, where it is probable the cities
would be, is far away. Only a very great city with tall buildings
would be visible from here, and the haze that hangs over the
valley might even hide a large city from us. We shall have to go
down into the valley to find out."</p>

<p>"I can scarcely wait," exclaimed Duare.</p>

<p>The trail on which we had approached the edge of the
escarpment turned sharply to the left and skirted the brink, but
from it a smaller trail branched and dropped over the edge.</p>

<p>This trail was little better than a faintly marked foot path,
and it zigzagged down the almost vertical face of the escarpment
in a manner calculated to send the cold chills up one's back if
he happened to be affected by such things.</p>

<p>"Few creatures go up and down here," remarked Duare, as she
looked over the edge of the escarpment at the dizzy trail.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we had better go on farther; there may be an easier
way down," I suggested, thinking that she might be fearful.</p>

<p>"No," she demurred. "I wanted to get out of the forest, and
here is my chance. Something has gone up and down here; and if
something else has, we can."</p>

<p>"Take my hand, then; it is very steep."</p>

<p>She did as I bid, and I also handed her my spear to use as a
staff. Thus we started the perilous descent. Even now I hate to
recall it. It was not only fraught with danger but it was
exceedingly exhausting. A dozen times I thought that we were
doomed; seemingly it was impossible to descend farther, and
certainly it would have been impossible to retrace our steps to
the summit, for there had been places where we had lowered
ourselves over ledges that we could not have again scaled.</p>

<p>Duare was very brave. She amazed me. Not only was her
courage remarkable, but her endurance was almost unbelievable in
one so delicately moulded. And she kept cheerful and good-
natured. Often she laughed when she would slip and almost fall,
where a fall meant death.</p>

<p>"I said," she recalled, once while we were resting, "that
something must have come up and down this trail. Now I wonder
what manner of creature it may be."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a mountain goat," I suggested. "I can think of
nothing else that might do it."</p>

<p>She did not know what a mountain goat was, and I knew of no
Venusan animal with which to compare it. She thought that a
mistal might easily go up and down such a trail. I had never
heard of this animal, but from her description I judged it to be
a rat-like animal about the size of a house cat.</p>

<p>As we were starting down again after a rest, I heard a noise
below us and looked over the edge of the ledge on which we stood
to see what had caused it.</p>

<p>"We are about to have our curiosity satisfied," I whispered to
Duare. "Here comes the trail maker."</p>

<p>"Is it a mistal?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, nor a mountain goat; but it is just the sort of a
creature that might most easily cling to this vertical pathway. I
don't know what you Amtorians call it. Take a look; perhaps you
will recognize it."</p>

<p>It was a huge, hideous lizard about twenty feet in length that
was climbing sluggishly upward toward our position.</p>

<p>Leaning on my shoulder, Duare glanced downward over the ledge.
She voiced a low gasp of terror. "I think it is a vere," she
said, "and if it is we are in for it. I have never seen one, but
I have read of them in books and seen their pictures; this one
looks like the pictures I have seen."</p>

<p>"Are they dangerous?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They are deadly," she replied. "We wouldn't have a chance
against a vere."</p>

<p>"See if you can climb back out of the way," I said to Duare.
"I will try to hold it here until you are safe." Then I turned
toward the creature crawling slowly upward. It was covered with
scales of red, black, and yellow arranged in intricate designs.
Its coloration and ornamentation were beautiful, but right there
its beauty stopped. It had a head not unlike that of a crocodile,
and along each side of its upper jaw was a row of gleaming white
horns. Across the top and down the sides of its head sprawled a
single huge eye of myriad facets.</p>

<p>It had not discovered us yet, but in another half minute it
would be upon us. I loosened a bit of rock near my hand and
hurled it down, thinking I might turn the creature back. The
missile struck it on the snout, and with a grunt it raised its
head and saw me.</p>

<p>Its great jaws opened and out shot the most prodigious tongue
I had ever seen. Like lightning it curled about me and snapped me
toward those gaping jaws from which was issuing a harsh screaming
whistle.</p>

<p>All that saved me from being instantly engulfed was the fact
that I was a little too large a mouthful for the creature to
negotiate with ease. I wedged crosswise of his snout and there I
fought with all my strength to keep from being dragged into that
rapacious maw.</p>

<p><br>It was a great slimy, toothless, sucking gullet that I
struggled to escape. Evidently the creature swallowed its prey
whole, its horns being probably solely for defense. From that
repulsive throat issued a fetid odor that almost overpowered me.
I think that it may have been a poisonous exhalation that was
intended to anaesthetize its victims. I felt myself growing weak
and dizzy, and then I saw Duare at my side.</p>

<p>She was grasping my spear in both hands and lunging viciously
at the horrid face of the vere. How small and frail and
inadequate she looked to be pitting herself against this fearsome
creature!&mdash;and how magnificent!</p>

<p>She was risking her life to save mine, and yet she did not
love me. Still, it was not incredible&mdash;there are noble
qualities far more unselfish than love. Loyalty is of these. But
I could not permit her to sacrifice her life for loyalty.</p>

<p>"Run, Duare!" I cried. "You can't save me&mdash;I am done for.
Run while you can, or it will kill us both."</p>

<p>She paid no attention to me, but thrust again. This time the
spear tore into the many-faceted eye. With a shrill whistle of
pain, the reptile turned upon Duare and sought to strike her with
its gleaming horns; but she stood her ground and, thrusting
again, drove the weapon between the distended jaws, drove it deep
and far into the pink flesh of that repulsive maw.</p>

<p>The spear point must have pierced the tongue, for it suddenly
went limp; and I rolled from its encircling grasp to the
ground.</p>

<p>Instantly I was on my feet again, and seizing Duare's arm
dragged her to one side as the vere charged blindly. It brushed
past us, whistling and screaming, and then turned, but in the
wrong direction.</p>

<p>It was then that I realized that the creature had been totally
blinded by the wound in its eye. Taking a perilous risk, I threw
an arm about Duare and slid over the edge of the ledge upon which
the brute had encountered us, for to have remained even an
instant where we were would have meant being maimed or hurled to
our doom by the viciously lashing tail of the frenzied
lizard.</p>

<p>Fortune favored us, and we came safely to rest upon another
ledge at a slightly lower level. Above us we could hear the
whistling scream of the vere and the thudding of his tail against
the rocky escarpment.</p>

<p><br>Fearing that the creature might descend upon us, we
hurried on, taking even greater risks than we had before; nor did
we stop until we had reached comparatively level ground near the
foot of the escarpment. Then we sat down to rest. We were both
panting from our exertions.</p>

<p>"You were wonderful," I said to Duare. "You risked your life
to save mine."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was just afraid to be left alone," she said with
some embarrassment. "I may have been entirely selfish."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that," I remonstrated. The truth was that I
didn't want to believe it. Another implication was far sweeter to
my ego.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," remarked Duare, "we found out what made the trail up
the escarpment."</p>

<p>"And that our beautiful valley may not be as secure as it
looks," I added.</p>

<p>"But the creature was going out of the valley up into the
forest," she argued. "That is probably where it lived."</p>

<p>"However, we had best be on our guard constantly."</p>

<p>"And now you have no spear; and that is a real loss, for it is
because of the spear that you are alive."</p>

<p>"Down there a little way," I indicated, pointing, "is a
winding strip of wood that seems to be following the meanderings
of a stream. There we can find material for another spear and
also water&mdash;I am as dry as a bone."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Duare, "and hungry too. Perhaps you can kill
another basto."</p>

<p>I laughed. "This time I shall make you a spear and a bow and
arrows, too. From what you have already done, you seem to be
better able to kill bastos than I."</p>

<p>Leisurely we walked toward the wood, which was about a mile
away, through soft grass of a pale violet hue. Flowers grew in
profusion on every hand. There were purple flowers and blue and
pale yellow; and their foliage, like the blossoms, was strange
and unearthly. There were flowers and leaves of colors that have
no name, colors such as no earthly eye had ever seen before.</p>

<p>Such things bear in upon me the strange isolation of our
senses. Each sense lives in a world of its own, and though it
lives a lifetime with its fellow senses it knows nothing of their
worlds.</p>

<p>My eyes see a color; but my fingers, my ears, my nose, my
palate may never know that color. I cannot even describe it so
that any of your senses may perceive it as I perceive it, if it
is a new color that you have never seen. Even less well might I
describe an odor or a flavor or the feel of some strange
substance. Only by comparison might I make you see the landscape
that stretched before our eyes, and there is nothing in your
world with which I may compare it&mdash;the glowing fog bank
overhead, the pale, soft pastels of field and forest and distant
misty mountains&mdash;no dense shadows and no high
lights&mdash;strange and beautiful and weird&mdash;intriguing,
provocative, compelling, always beckoning one on to further
investigation, to new adventure.</p>

<p>All about us the plain between the escarpment and the forest
was dotted with trees; and, lying beneath them or grazing in the
open, were animals that were entirely new to my experience either
here or on Earth. That several distinct families and numerous
genera were represented was apparent to even a cursory
survey.</p>

<p>Some were large and cumbersome, others were small and dainty.
All were too far away for me to note them in detail; and for that
I was glad, for I guessed that among that array of wild beasts
there must be some at least which might prove dangerous to man.
But, like all animals except hungry carnivores and men, they
showed no disposition to attack us so long as we did not
interfere with them or approach them too closely.</p>

<p><br>"I see that we shall not go hungry here," remarked
Duare.</p>

<p>"I hope some of those little fellows are good to eat," I
laughed.</p>

<p>"I am sure that big one under the tree is delicious; the one
looking at us," and she pointed to an enormous, shaggy creature
as large as an elephant. Duare had a sense of humor.</p>

<p>"Possibly it entertains the same idea concerning us," I
suggested; "here it comes!"</p>

<p>The huge beast was walking toward us. The forest was still a
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>"Shall we run?" asked Duare.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that would be fatal. You know, it is almost
instinctive for a beast to pursue any creature that runs away
from it. I think the best course for us to follow is to continue
steadily toward the forest without seeming haste. If the thing
does not increase its speed we shall reach the trees ahead of it;
if we run for it the chances are that it will overtake us, for of
all created things mankind seems to be about the slowest."</p>

<p>As we proceeded, we constantly cast backward glances at the
shaggy menace trailing us. He lumbered along, exhibiting no signs
of excitement; but his long strides were eating up the distance
between us. I saw that he would overtake us before we reached the
forest. I felt utterly helpless, with my puny bow and my tiny
arrows, before this towering mountain of muscle.</p>

<p>"Quicken your pace a little, Duare," I directed.</p>

<p>She did as I bid, but after a few steps she glanced back. "Why
don't you come, too?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Don't argue," I snapped a little shortly. "Do as I bid
you."</p>

<p>She stopped and waited for me. "I shall do as I please," she
informed me, "and it does not please me to let you make this
sacrifice for me. If you are to be killed, I shall be killed with
you. Furthermore, Carson Napier, please remember that I am the
daughter of a jong and am not accustomed to being ordered
about."</p>

<p>"If there were not more pressing matters to occupy me I would
spank you," I growled.</p>

<p>She looked at me, horrified; then she stamped one little foot
in rage and commenced to cry. "You take advantage of me because
there is no one to protect me," she sputtered. "I hate you,
you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I am trying to protect you, Duare; and you are only
making it harder for me."</p>

<p>"I don't want any of your protection; I would rather be dead.
It is more honorable to be dead than to be talked to like
that&mdash;I am the daughter of a jong."</p>

<p>"I think you have mentioned that several times before," I
said, coldly.</p>

<p>She threw up her head and walked stiffly on without looking
back at me. Even her little shoulders and back radiated offended
dignity and stifled rage.</p>

<p>I glanced behind me. The mighty beast was scarce fifty feet
away; ahead of us the forest was about the same distance. Duare
could not see me. I stopped and faced the colossus. By the time
it had dispatched me Duare would probably be close to the safety
of the branches of the nearest tree.</p>

<p>I held my bow in one hand, but my arrows remained in the crude
quiver. I had fashioned to hold them behind my right shoulder. I
had sense enough to realize that the only effect they might have
upon this mountain of hairy sinew would be to enrage it.</p>

<p>After I stopped, the beast approached more slowly, almost
warily. Two little eyes, set far apart, regarded me intently; two
large, mulish ears pricked forward; quivering nostrils
dilated.</p>

<p>On it came, very gradually now. A bony protuberance extending
from its snout to its forehead commenced to rise until it
revealed itself to my astonished gaze as a sharp-pointed horn.
The horn rose until it pointed fiercely at me, a terrible weapon
of offense.</p>

<p>I did not move. My experience of earthly animals had taught me
that few will attack without provocation, and I staked my life on
the chance that the same rule prevailed on Venus. But there are
other provocations besides those that arouse fear or anger; a
most potent one is hunger. However, this creature looked
herbivorous; and I hoped that it was herbivorous. But I could
not forget the basto; that somewhat resembled an American bison,
yet was omnivorous.</p>

<p>Closer and closer came the remarkable beast, very, very
slowly, as though its mind were assailed by doubts. It towered
above me like a living mountain. I could feel its warm breath
upon my almost naked body; but, better still, I could smell its
breath&mdash;the sweet, inoffensive breath of a grass eater. My
hopes rose.</p>

<p>The creature stuck out its muzzle toward me; a low rumbling
issued from its cavernous chest; that terrible horn touched me;
then the cool, moist muzzle. The beast sniffed at me. Slowly the
horn subsided.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a snort, the animal wheeled about and went
galloping off, bucking and jumping as I have seen a playful steer
buck and jump, its little tail stiffly erect. It presented a most
ludicrous appearance&mdash;as would a steam locomotive skipping
rope. I laughed, possibly a little hysterically, for my knees
were suddenly weak and wobbly. If I had not been near death, I
had at least thought that I was.</p>

<p><br>As I turned back toward the forest I saw Duare standing
there looking at me, and as I approached her I perceived that she
was wide-eyed and trembling.</p>

<p>"You are very brave, Carson," she said with a little catch in
her throat. Her anger seemed to have departed. "I know that you
remained there so that I might escape."</p>

<p>"There really wasn't much else that I could do," I assured
her. "And now that that's over, let's see if we can't find
something to eat&mdash;something a few sizes smaller than that
mountain of steaks and roasts. I think we'll go on until we
strike the stream that flows through this forest. We may find a
drinking place or a ford that the animals are accustomed to
coming to."</p>

<p>"There are many animals out there on the plain that are
small," suggested Duare. "Why don't you hunt there?"</p>

<p>"There are plenty of animals, but there are not enough trees,"
I replied with a laugh. "We may need some trees in our hunting. I
don't know enough about these Amtorian beasts as yet to warrant
me in taking unnecessary risks."</p>

<p>We moved on into the wood beneath the delicate foliage and
among the strangely beautiful boles with their lacquer-like bark
of white and red and yellow and blue.</p>

<p>Presently we came in sight of a little river winding leisurely
between its violet banks, and at the same instant I saw a small
creature drinking. It was about the size of a goat, but it didn't
look like a goat. Its sharply pointed ears were constantly
moving, as though on the alert for the slightest sound of danger;
its tufted tail switched nervously. A collar of short horns
encircled its neck just where it joined the head. They pointed
slightly forward. There must have been a dozen of them. I could
not but wonder what their specific purpose might be until I
recalled the vere from whose horrible maw I had so recently
escaped. That necklace of short horns would most certainly have
discouraged any creature that was in the habit of swallowing its
prey whole.</p>

<p>Very gently, I pushed Duare behind a tree and crept forward,
fitting an arrow to my bow. As I was preparing to shoot, the
creature threw up its head and turned half around. Probably it
had heard me. I had been creeping on it from behind, but its
change of position revealed its left side to me, and I planted my
first arrow squarely in its heart.</p>

<p>So we made our camp beside the river and dined on juicy chops,
delicious fruits, and the clear water from the little stream. Our
surroundings were idyllic. Strange birds sang to us, arboreal
quadrupeds swung through the trees jabbering melodiously in soft
sing-song voices.</p>

<p>"It is very lovely here," said Duare, dreamily.
"Carson&mdash;I wish that I were not the daughter of a jong."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7">VII. &mdash; THE GLOOMY CASTLE</a></h2>

<p class="first">We were both loath to leave this lovely spot,
and so we tarried there for two days while I made weapons for
Duare and a new spear for myself.</p>

<p>I had constructed a little platform in a tree that overhung
the river; and there at night we were comparatively safe from
predatory animals while the soft music of the purling water
lulled us to sleep, a sleep that might be suddenly broken by the
savage roars of hunting beasts or the screams of their victims,
to which the distant lowing and bellowing of the vast herds upon
the plain furnished a harmonious undertone in this raw aria of
life.</p>

<p>It was our last night in this pleasant camp. We were sitting
on our little platform watching the fish leaping and jumping in
the river below.</p>

<p>"I could be happy here forever&mdash;with you, Duare," I
said.</p>

<p>"One may not think of happiness alone," she replied; "there is
duty also."</p>

<p>"But what if circumstances make us helpless to perform our
duties? Aren't we warranted in making the best of our fate and
making the most of the chance for happiness where we find
it?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I mean that there is practically no possibility that we can
ever reach Vepaja. We do not know where it is, and if we did it
seems to me that there is not even the remotest chance that we
should survive the dangers that must lie along that unknown trail
that leads back to the house of Mintep, your father."</p>

<p>"I know that you are right," she replied a little wearily,
"but it is my duty to try; and I may never cease to seek to
return, to the end of my life, no matter how remote I may know
the chance of success may be."</p>

<p>"Isn't that being a little unreasonable, Duare?"</p>

<p>"You do not understand, Carson Napier. If I had a brother or
sister it might make a difference; but I have neither, and my
father and I are the last of our line. It is not for myself nor
for my father that I must return but for my country&mdash;the
royal line of the jongs of Vepaja must not be broken, and there
is none to perpetuate it but myself."</p>

<p>"And if we do return&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"When I am twenty I shall marry a noble selected by my father,
and after my father dies I shall be vadjong,* or queen, until my
oldest son is twenty; then he will be jong."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Vadjong, meaning queen, is derived from
vadja, female, and jong, king.]</p>

<p>"But with the longevity serum that your scientists have
perfected your father will never die; so why return?"</p>

<p>"I hope he will not die, but there are accidents and battles
and assassins. Oh, why discuss it! The royal line must be
preserved!"</p>

<p>"And what of me, if we reach Vepaja?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Will there be a chance for me?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"If your father consents, will you marry me?" I blurted.</p>

<p><br>Duare flushed. "How many times must I tell you that you
may not speak of such serious things to me?"</p>

<p>"I can't help it, Duare; I love you. I care nothing for
customs nor jongs nor dynasties. I shall tell your father that I
love you, and I shall tell him that you love me."</p>

<p>"I do not love you; you have no right to say that. It is
sinful and wicked. Because once I was weak and lost my head and
said a thing I did not mean you have no right to constantly throw
it in my face."</p>

<p>Now that was just like a woman. I had been fighting every
impulse to keep from speaking of love during all the time we had
been together. I couldn't recall but one other instance when I
had lost control of myself, yet she accused me of constantly
throwing in her face the one admission of love that she had
made.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, sullenly, "I shall do what I said I'd do, if I
ever see your father again."</p>

<p>"And do you know what he will do?"</p>

<p>"If he's the right kind of a father he'll say, 'Bless you, my
children.'"</p>

<p>"He is a jong before he is a father, and he will have you
destroyed. Even if you do not make any such mad admission to him,
I shall have to use all of my powers of persuasion to save you
from death."</p>

<p>"Why should he kill me?"</p>

<p>"No man who has spoken, without royal permission, to a
janjong* is ordinarily permitted to live. That you
may be with me alone for months and possibly years before we
return to Vepaja will but tend to exaggerate the seriousness of
the situation. I shall plead your service to me; that you risked
your life innumerable times to preserve mine; and that I think
will have sufficient weight to save you from death; but, of
course, you will be banished from Vepaja."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Princess.]

<p>"That is a pleasant outlook. I may lose my life, and I am
certain to lose you. Under such circumstances, do you think that
I will prosecute the search for Vepaja with much enthusiasm or
diligence?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not with enthusiasm; but with diligence, yes. You
will do it for me, because of that thing which you call
love. I have learned that you will do anything for that."</p>

<p>"Possibly you are right," I said, and I knew that she was.</p>

<p>The next day we started, in accordance with a plan we had
formulated, to follow the little river down toward the big river
along which we would continue to the sea. Where we should go from
there was problematical. We decided to wait until we reached the
sea before making any further plans. What lay before us we could
not guess; had we been able to we might have fled back to the
comparative safety of the gloomy forest we had so recently
quitted with delight.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we were taking a short cut across open
ground where the river made a great bend. It was rather rough
going, for there were many rocks and boulders and the surface of
the land was cut by gullies. Large bowlders or outcroppings of
rock were numerous and cut off our view in all directions when we
were on the higher ground, while from the bottoms of the gullies
we could see only a short distance ahead.</p>

<p>As we clambered up the bank of a particularly deep gully
I chanced to glance back and saw a strange animal standing on the
opposite rim watching us. It was about the size of a German
police dog, but there the similarity ceased. It had a massive,
curved beak remarkably similar to that of a parrot; and its body
was covered with feathers; but it was no bird, for it went on
four legs and had no wings. Forward of its two short ears were
three horns, one in front of either ear and the third growing
midway between the others. As it turned part way around to look
back at something we could not see, I saw that it had no tail. At
a distance its legs and feet appeared bird-like.</p>

<p>"Do you see what I see, Duare?" I asked, nodding in the
direction of the weird creature; "or am I suffering from a touch
of fever?"</p>

<p>"Of course I see it," she replied, "but I don't know what it
is. I am sure that there is no such creature on the island of
Vepaja."</p>

<p>"There's another of them, and another, and another!" I
exclaimed. "Lord! there must be a dozen of them."</p>

<p>They were standing in a little knot surveying us when suddenly
the one we had first seen raised its grotesque head and voiced a
hoarse, wailing scream; then it started down into the gully and
headed for us at a rapid gallop, and behind it came its fellows,
all now voicing that hideous cry.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" asked Duare. "Do you suppose they
are dangerous?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether they are dangerous or not," I replied,
"but I wish that there were a tree handy."</p>

<p>"A forest does have its advantages," admitted Duare. "What are
we going to do?"</p>

<p>"It would do no good to run; so we might as well stand here
and have it out with them. We'll have some advantage as they come
up the bank of the gully."</p>

<p>I fitted an arrow to my bow and Duare did likewise; then we
stood waiting for them to come within range. They loped easily
across the bottom of the gully and started the ascent. They
didn't seem to be in much of a hurry; that is, they didn't seem
to be extending themselves to their full speed, probably because
we were not running away from them.</p>

<p>Perhaps this surprised them, for they presently slowed down to
a walk and advanced warily. They had ceased their baying. The
feathers along their backs rose stiffly erect as they slunk
toward us.</p>

<p>Aiming carefully at the foremost, I loosed an arrow. It struck
the beast full in the chest, and with a scream it stopped and
tore at the feathered shaft protruding from its body. The others
halted and surrounded it. They made a strange cackling sound.</p>

<p>The wounded creature staggered and sank to the ground, and
instantly its fellows were upon it, tearing and rending. For a
moment it fought fiercely to defend itself, but futilely.</p>

<p>As the others commenced to devour their fallen comrade I
motioned Duare to follow me, and we turned and ran toward the
trees we could see about a mile away where the river turned back
across our line of march. But we hadn't gone far before we heard
again the infernal screaming that told us that the pack was on
our trail.</p>

<p>This time they overtook us while we were at the bottom of a
depression, and once again we made a stand. Instead of attacking
us directly, the beasts slunk about just out of range, as though
they knew the danger line beyond which they would be safe; then
slowly they circled us until we were surrounded.</p>

<p>"If they charge now, all at once," said Duare, "we are sure to
be finished."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if we succeed in killing a couple of them the others
will stop to devour them, thus giving us another chance to get
closer to the wood," I argued with an assumed optimism that
I did not feel </p>

<p>As we waited for the next move of our antagonists, we heard a
loud shout in the direction from which we had come. Looking
quickly up, I saw a man seated upon the back of a four footed
animal at the rim of the depression in which we stood.</p>

<p><br>At the sound of the human voice, the beasts surrounding
us looked in the direction of the interruption and immediately
commenced to cackle. The man on the beast rode slowly down toward
us, and as he came to the ring of beasts they moved aside and let
him pass through their savage ranks.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate for you that I came when I did," said the
stranger, as the beast he rode stopped in front of us; "these
kazars of mine are a ferocious lot." He was eyeing us intently,
especially Duare. "Who are you, and where are you from?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"We are strangers, and we are lost," I replied. "I am from
California." I did not wish to tell him that we were from Vepaja
until we knew more of him. If he was a Thorist he was an enemy;
and the less he knew about us the better, especially that we were
from the country of Mintep, the jong, than whom the Thorists have
no more bitter enemy, nor any they hate more venomously </p>

<p>"California," he repeated. "I never heard of such a country.
Where is it?"</p>

<p>"In North America," I replied, but he only shook his head.
"And who are you," I asked, "and what country is this?"</p>

<p>"This is Noobol, but that of course you already know. This
part of it is known as Morov. I am Skor, the jong of Morov. But
you have not told me your names."</p>

<p>"This is Duare," I replied, "and I am Carson." I did not give
my surname as they are seldom used on Venus.</p>

<p>"And where were you going?"</p>

<p>"We were trying to find our way to the sea."</p>

<p>"From where did you come?"</p>

<p>"Recently we were in Kapdor," I explained.</p>

<p>I saw his eyes narrow ominously. "So you are Thorists!" he
snapped.</p>

<p>"No," I assured him, "we are not. We were prisoners of the
Thorists." I hoped that my guess had been a good one and that he
was not kindly disposed toward the Thorists. The slender thread
upon which I hung my hopes was no more substantial than the frown
that had clouded his brow at my admission that we had just come
from Kapdor.</p>

<p>To my relief his expression changed. "I am glad that you are
not Thorists; otherwise I would not help you. I have no use for
the breed."</p>

<p>"You will help us, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," he replied. He was looking at Duare as he
spoke, and I did not exactly relish the tone of his voice nor the
expression on his face.</p>

<p>The kazars were circling around us, cackling and whistling.
When one of them approached us too close, Skor would flick it
with the lash of a long whip he carried; and the creature would
retreat, screaming and cackling the louder.</p>

<p>"Come," he said presently, "I will take you to my house; then
we may discuss plans for the future. The woman may ride behind me
on my zorat; you may walk. It is not far."</p>

<p>"I prefer to walk," said Duare. "I am accustomed to it
now."</p>

<p>Skor's eyes narrowed a bit. He started to speak, and then he
checked himself. Finally he shrugged. "As you will," he said, and
turned the head of his mount back in the direction from which he
had come.</p>

<p><br>The creature he rode, which he called a zorat, was unlike
any beast that I had ever seen before. It was about the size of a
small horse. Its long, slender legs suggested great speed. Its
feet were round and nailless and heavily calloused on the
bottoms. Its almost vertical pasterns suggested that it might be
a hard gaited beast, but this was not so. Later I learned that
almost horizontal femurs and humeri absorbed the jolts and
rendered the zorat an easy riding saddle animal.</p>

<p>Above its withers and just forward of its kidneys were soft
pads or miniature humps which formed a perfect saddle with
natural pommel and cantle. Its head was short and broad, with two
large, saucer-like eyes and pendulous ears. Its teeth were those
of a grass-eater. Its only means of defense seemed to lie in its
fleetness, although, as I afterward had occasion to discover, it
could use its jaws and teeth most effectively when its short
temper was aroused.</p>

<p>We walked beside Skor on the journey toward his house, the
grotesque kazars following docilely behind at the command of
their master. The way led toward the great bend of the river,
that we had sought to avoid by taking a short cut, and a forest
that lined its banks. The proximity of the kazars made me
nervous, for occasionally one of them would trot close at our
heels; and I was fearful that Duare might be injured by one of
the fierce beasts before I could prevent it. I asked Skor what
purpose the creatures served.</p>

<p>"I use them for hunting," he replied, "but principally for
protection. I have enemies; and then, too, there are many savage
beasts roaming at large in Morov. The kazars are quite fearless
and very savage fighters. Their greatest weakness is their
predilection for cannibalism; they will abandon a fight to devour
one of their own number that has fallen."</p>

<p>Shortly after we entered the forest we came upon a large,
gloomy, fortresslike building of stone. It was built upon a low
rise of ground at the water's edge, the river lapping the masonry
upon that side. A stone wall connecting with the river wall of
the building inclosed several acres of clear land in front of the
structure. A heavy gate closed the only aperture that was visible
in this wall.</p>

<p>As we approached, Skor shouted, "Open! It is the jong," and
the gates swung slowly outward.</p>

<p>As we entered, several armed men, who had been sitting beneath
one of the several trees that had been left standing when the
ground was cleared, arose and stood with bowed heads. They were a
hard and also a sad looking lot. The feature that struck me most
forcibly was the strange hue of their skin, a repulsive,
unhealthy pallor, a seeming bloodlessness. I caught the eyes of
one that chanced to raise his head as we passed, and I shivered.
They were glazed, clammy eyes, without light, without fire. I
would have thought the fellow stone blind but for the fact that
the instant that my eyes caught his they dropped swiftly. Another
had an ugly, open wound across his cheek from temple to chin; it
gaped wide, but it did not bleed.</p>

<p>Skor snapped a brief order; and two of the men herded the pack
of cackling kazars into a strong inclosure built beside the
gateway, as we proceeded on toward the house. Perhaps I should
call it castle, for that is what it most resembled.</p>

<p>The inclosure across which we passed was barren except for the
few trees that had been left standing. It was littered with
refuse of all descriptions and was unspeakably disorderly and
untidy. Old sandals, rags, broken pottery, and the garbage from
the castle kitchens were strewn promiscuously about. The only
spot from which any effort had been made to remove the litter was
a few hundred square feet of stone flagging before the main
entrance to the building.</p>

<p><br>Here Skor dismounted as three more men similar to those
at the gate came lifelessly from the interior of the building.
One of these took Skor's mount and led it away; the others stood
one on either side of the entrance as we passed in.</p>

<p>The doorway was small, the door that closed it thick and
heavy. It seemed to be the only opening on the first floor on
this side of the castle. Along the second and third floor levels
I had seen small windows heavily barred. At one corner of the
building I had noticed a tower rising two more stories above the
main part of the castle. This, too, had small windows, some of
which were barred.</p>

<p>The interior of the building was dark and gloomy. Coupled with
the appearance of the inmates I had already seen it engendered
within me a feeling of depression that I could not throw off.</p>

<p>"You must be hungry," suggested Skor. "Come out into the inner
court&mdash;it is pleasanter there&mdash;and I will have food
served."</p>

<p>We followed him down a short corridor and through a doorway
into a courtyard around which the castle was built. The inclosure
reminded me of a prison yard. It was flagged with stone. No
living thing grew there. The gray stone walls, cut with their
small windows, rose upon four sides. There had been no effort
toward architectural ornamentation in the design of the
structure, nor any to beautify the courtyard in any way. Here,
too, was litter and trash that it had evidently been easier to
throw into the inner court than carry to the outer.</p>

<p>I was oppressed by forebodings of ill. I wished that we had
never entered the place, but I tried to brush my fears aside. I
argued that Skor had given no indications of being other than a
kindly and solicitous host. He had seemed anxious to befriend us.
That he was a jong I had commenced to doubt, for there was no
suggestion of royalty in his mode of living.</p>

<p>In the center of the court a plank table was flanked by grimy,
well worn benches. On the table were the remains of a meal. Skor
graciously waved us toward the benches; then he clapped his hands
together three times before he seated himself at the head of the
table.</p>

<p>"I seldom have guests here," he said. "It is quite a pleasant
treat for me. I hope that you will enjoy your stay. I am sure
that I shall," and as he spoke he looked at Duare in that way
that I did not like.</p>

<p>"I am sure that we might enjoy it could we remain," replied
Duare quickly, "but that is not possible. I must return to the
house of my father."</p>

<p>"Where is that?" asked Skor.</p>

<p>"In Vepaja," explained Duare.</p>

<p>"I never heard of that country," said Skor. "Where is it?"</p>

<p>"You never heard of Vepaja!" exclaimed Duare incredulously.
"Why, all the present country of Thora was called Vepaja until
the Thorists rose and took it and drove the remnants of the
ruling class to the island that is now all that remains of
ancient Vepaja."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I had heard of that," admitted Skor; "but it was a
long time ago and in distant Trabol."</p>

<p>"Is this not Trabol?" asked Duare.</p>

<p>"No," replied Skor; "this is Strabol."</p>

<p>"But Strabol is the hot country," argued Duare. "No one can
live in Strabol."</p>

<p>"You are in Strabol now. It is hot here during a portion of
the year, but not so hot as to be unendurable."</p>

<p><br>I was interested. If what Skor said were true, we had
crossed the equator and were now in the northern hemisphere of
Venus. The Vepajans had told me that Strabol was
uninhabitable&mdash;a steaming jungle reeking with heat and
moisture and inhabited only by fierce and terrible beasts and
reptiles. The entire northern hemisphere was a <i>terra
incognita</i> to the men of the southern hemisphere, and for that
reason I had been anxious to explore it.</p>

<p>With the responsibility of Duare on my shoulders I could not
do much exploring, but I might learn something from Skor; so I
asked him of the country farther north.</p>

<p>"It is no good," he snapped. "It is the land of fools. They
frown upon true science and progress. They drove me out; they
would have killed me. I came here and established the kingdom of
Morov. That was many years ago&mdash;perhaps a hundred years. I
have never returned since to the country of my birth; but
sometimes their people come here," and he laughed
unpleasantly.</p>

<p>Just then a woman came from the building, evidently in
response to Skor's summons. She was middle aged. Her skin was the
same repulsive hue as that of the men I had seen, and it was very
dirty. Her mouth hung open and her tongue protruded; it was dry
and swollen. Her eyes were glazed and staring. She moved with a
slow, awkward shuffle. And now, behind her, came two men. They
were much as she; there was something indescribably revolting
about all three.</p>

<p>"Take these away!" snapped Skor with a wave of the hand toward
the soiled dishes. "And bring food."</p>

<p>The three gathered up the dishes and shuffled away. None of
them spoke. The look of horror in Duare's eyes could not have
gone unnoticed by Skor.</p>

<p>"You do not like my retainers?" demanded Skor testily.</p>

<p>"But I said nothing," objected Duare.</p>

<p>"I saw it in your face." Suddenly Skor broke into laughter.
There was no mirth in it, nor was there laughter in his eyes but
another expression, a terrible glint that passed as quickly as it
had come. "They are excellent servants," he said in normal tones;
"they do not talk too much, and <i>they do whatever I tell them
to do</i>."</p>

<p>Presently the three returned carrying vessels of food. There
was meat, partially raw, partially burned, and wholly
unpalatable; there were fruits and vegetables, none of which
appeared to have been washed; there was wine. It was the only
thing there fit for human consumption.</p>

<p>The meal was not a success. Duare could not eat. I sipped my
wine and watched Skor eat ravenously of all the filthy mess. From
a partially open dooway several small animals came scurrying
across the flagging toward the table. Skor flung them a bone upon
which he had been gnawing, and they commenced to fight for it
while Skor looked on laughing.and These creatures were rodents
about the size of earthly house cats.</p>

<p>I saw Duare surreptitiously removing the food from her plate
and dropping it on the floor when Skor was not looking at her.
Following her strategy, I did the same. Thus we avoided eating
the food witout offending our host, and the mistals had a hearty
meal.</p>

<p>Darkness was falling as Skor arose from the table. "I will
show you to your rooms," he said. "You must be tired." His tone
and manner were those of the perfect host. "To-morrow you shall
set out again upon your journey."</p>

<p>Relieved by this promise we followed him into the house. It
was a dark and gloomy abode, chill and cheerless. We followed him
up a stairway to the second floor and into a long, dark corridor.
Presently he stopped before a door and threw it open.</p>

<p>"May you sleep well," he said to Duare, bowing and motioning
her to enter.</p>

<p>Silently Duare crossed the threshold and Skor closed the door
behind her; then he conducted me to the end of the corridor, up
two flights of stairs and ushered me into a circular room that I
guessed was in the tower I had seen when we entered the
castle.</p>

<p>"I hope you awaken refreshed," he said politely and withdrew,
closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>I heard his footsteps descending the stairs until they were
lost in the distance. I thought of Duare down there alone in this
gloomy and mysterious pile. I had no reason to believe that she
was not safe, but nevertheless I was apprehensive. Anyway, I had
no intention of leaving her alone  down there. If anything should
happen, I wanted to be where I could protect her.</p>

<p>I waited until he had had plenty of time to go to his own
quarters wherever they might be; then I stepped to the door,
determined to go to Duare. I laid my hand upon the latch and
sought to open it. It was locked from the outside. Quickly I went
to the several windows. Each was heavily barred. Faintly from the
distant recesses of that forbidding pile I thought I heard a
mocking laugh.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE GIRL IN THE TOWER</a></h2>

<p class="first">The tower room in which I found myself
imprisoned was lighted only by the mysterious night glow that
relieves the nocturnal darkness of Venus, which would otherwise
have been impenetrable. Dimly I saw the furnishings of the
room&mdash;they were meager. The place had more the aspect of a
prison cell than a guest chamber.</p>

<p>I crossed to a chest of drawers and investigated it. It was
filled with odds and ends of worn and useless apparel, bits of
string, a few lengths of rope which, I had an ugly suspicion,
might once have served as bonds. I paced the floor worrying about
Duare. I was helpless. I could do nothing. It would be vain to
pound upon the door or call for release. The will that had
incarcerated me was supreme here. Only by the voluntary act of
that will could I be released.</p>

<p>Seating myself on a rude bench before a small table I tried to
plan; I sought to discover some loophole for escape. Apparently
there was none. I arose and once again examined the window bars
and the sturdy door; they were impregnable.</p>

<p>Finally I crossed to a rickety couch that stood against the
wall and lay down upon the worn and odorous hide that covered it.
Absolute silence reigned&mdash;the silence of the tomb. For a
long time it was unbroken; then I heard a sound above me. I
listened, trying to interpret it. It was like the slow padding of
naked feet&mdash;back and forth, to and fro above my head.</p>

<p>I had thought that I was on the top floor of the tower, but
now I realized that there must be another room above the one in
which I had been placed&mdash;if the sound I heard was that of
human feet.</p>

<p>Listening to that monotonous padding had a soporific effect
upon my jaded nerves. I caught myself dozing a couple of times. I
did not wish to go to sleep; something seemed to warn me that I
must remain awake, but at last I must have succumbed.</p>

<p>How long I slept I do not know. I awoke with a start,
conscious that something touched me. A dim figure was leaning
over me. I started to rise. Instantly strong fingers clutched my
throat&mdash;cold, clammy fingers&mdash;the fingers of Death they
seemed.</p>

<p>Struggling, I sought the throat of my antagonist. I closed
upon it&mdash;it, too, was cold and clammy. I am a strong man,
but the <i>thing</i> upon my chest was stronger. I struck at it with
closed fists. From the doorway came a low, hideous laugh. I felt
my scalp stiffen to the horror of it all.</p>

<p>I sensed that death was close, and a multitude of thoughts
raced through my mind. But uppermost among them were thoughts of
Duare and harrowing regret that I must leave her here in the
clutches of the fiend I was now certain was the instigator of
this attack upon me. I guessed that its purpose was to dispose of
me and thus remove the only possible obstacle that might stand
between himself and Duare, whom he evidently desired.</p>

<p>I was still struggling when something struck me on the head;
then came oblivion.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was daylight when I regained consciousness. I
still lay upon the couch, sprawled upon my back. Staring up at
the ceiling, trying to collect my thoughts and memories, I
perceived a crack just above me such as might have been made by a
trap door partially raised; and through the crack two eyes were
peering down at me.</p>

<p>Some new horror? I did not move. I lay there fascinated,
watching the trap door slowly open. Presently a face was
revealed. It was the face of a girl, a very beautiful girl; but
it was strained and drawn and the eyes were terrified, frightened
eyes.</p>

<p>In a whisper, the girl spoke. "You are alive?" she asked.</p>

<p>I raised myself on an elbow. "Who are you?" I demanded. "Is
this some new trick to torture me?"</p>

<p>"No. I am a prisoner, too. He has gone away. Perhaps we can
escape."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked. I was still skeptical, believing her a
confederate of Skor.</p>

<p>"Can you get up here? There are no bars on my windows; that is
because they are so high that no one could jump from them without
being killed or badly injured. If we only had a rope!"</p>

<p>I considered the matter for a moment before I replied. What if
it was a trick? Could I be any worse off in one room in this
accursed castle than in another?</p>

<p>"There is rope down here," I said. "I will get it and come up.
Perhaps there is not enough to be of any use to us, but I will
bring what there is."</p>

<p>"How will you get up?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That will not be difficult. Wait until I get the rope."</p>

<p>I went to the chest of drawers and took out all the rope and
string that I had discovered there the previous night; then I
shoved the chest across the floor until it was directly beneath
the trap door.</p>

<p>From the top of the chest I could easily reach the edge of the
floor above. Handing the rope up to the girl, I quickly drew
myself up into the room with her; then she closed the trap and we
stood facing each other.</p>

<p>Despite her disheveled and frightened appearance, I found her
even more beautiful than I had at first thought her; and as her
fine eyes met mine in mutual appraisal my fears of treachery
vanished. I was sure that no duplicity lurked behind that lovely
countenance.</p>

<p>"You need not doubt me," she said as though she had read my
thoughts, "though I cannot wonder that you doubt every one in
this terrible place."</p>

<p>"Then how can you trust me?" I asked. "You know nothing of
me."</p>

<p>"I know enough," she replied. "From that window I saw you when
you and your companion came yesterday with Skor, and I knew that
he had two more victims. I heard them bring you to the room below
last night. I did not know which one of you it was. I wanted to
warn you then, but I was afraid of Skor. I walked the floor for a
long time trying to decide what to do."</p>

<p>"Then it was you I heard walking?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Then I heard them come again; I heard sounds of a
scuffle and Skor's awful laugh. Oh, how I hate and fear that
laugh! After that it was quiet. I thought they had killed you, if
it was you, or taken the girl away, if it was she they had
imprisoned in the room below. Oh, the poor thing! And she is so
beautiful. I hope she got away safely, but I am afraid there can
be little hope of that."</p>

<p>"Got away? What do you mean?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"She escaped very early this morning. I do not know how she
got out of her room, but from the window I saw her cross the
outer courtyard. She climbed the wall on the river side, and she
must have dropped into the river. I did not see her again."</p>

<p>"Duare has escaped! You are sure it was she?"</p>

<p>"It was the beautiful girl who came here with you yesterday.
About an hour after she got away Skor must have discovered that
she was gone. He came out of the castle in a terrible rage. He
took with him all of the miserable creatures that watch the gate,
and all his fierce kazars, and set out in pursuit. Possibly never
again may we have such an opportunity to escape."</p>

<p>"Let's get busy, then!" I exclaimed. "Have you a plan?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "With the rope we can lower ourselves to
the castle roof and from there to the courtyard. There is no one
watching the gate; the kazars are gone. If we are discovered we
shall have to trust to our legs, but there are only three or four
of Skor's retainers left in the castle and they are not very
alert when he is not here."</p>

<p>"I have my weapons," I reminded her. "Skor did not take them
from me, and if any of his people try to stop us I will kill
them."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "You cannot kill them," she whispered,
shuddering.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I demanded. "Why can I not kill them?"</p>

<p>"Because they are already dead."</p>

<p><br>I looked at her in astonishment as the meaning of her
words slowly filtered to my shocked brain to explain the pitiful
creatures that had filled me with such disgust on the previous
day.</p>

<p>"But," I exclaimed, "how can they be dead? I saw them move
about and obey the commands of Skor."</p>

<p>"I do not know," she replied; "it is Skor's terrible secret.
Presently you will be as they, if we do not escape; and the girl
who came with you, and I&mdash;after a while. He will keep us a
little longer in the flesh for the purpose of his experiments.
Every day he takes a little blood from me. He is seeking the
secret of life. He says that he can reproduce body cells, and
with these he has instilled synthetic life into the poor
creatures that he has resurrected from the grave. But it is only
a parody on life; no blood flows in those dead veins, and the
dead minds are animated only by the thoughts that Skor transmits
to them by some occult, telepathic means.</p>

<p>"But what he most desires is the power to reproduce germ cells
and thus propagate a new race of beings fashioned according to
his own specifications. That is why he takes blood from me; that
is why he wanted the girl you call Duare. When our blood has
become so depleted that death is near, he will kill us and we
will be like these others. But he would not keep us here; he
would take us to the city where he rules as jong. Here he keeps
only a few poor, degraded specimens; but he says that in Kormor
he has many fine ones."</p>

<p>"So he <i>is</i> a jong? I doubted it."</p>

<p>"He made himself a jong and created his own subjects," she
said.</p>

<p>"And he kept you only to draw blood from you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He is not like other men; he is not human."</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"A long time; but I am still alive because Skor has been away
most of the time in Kormor."</p>

<p>"Well, we must get away, too, before he returns. I want to
search for Duare. She will be helpless out there alone."</p>

<p>I went to one of the windows, none of which was barred, and
looked down on the castle roof below, a distance of about twenty
feet. Then I got the rope and examined it carefully. There were
several pieces, in all about forty feet&mdash;more than enough;
also it was stout rope. I tied the pieces together and then
returned to the window. The girl was at my elbow.</p>

<p>"Can anyone see us from here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The creatures are not very alert," she replied. "Those that
Skor left here are the servants. They remain in a room on the
first floor on the other side of the castle. When he is away they
just sit. After a while two of them will bring food for us; and
we should get away before they come, for sometimes they forget to
go back to their quarters; then they sit around outside my door
for hours. You will notice that there is a grille in the door;
they would see us if we attempted to escape while they were
there."</p>

<p>"We'll start now," I said. Then I made a loop in one end of
the rope and passed it around the girl's body so that she could
sit in it while I lowered her to the roof.</p>

<p><br>Without an instant's hesitation she stepped to the sill
of the window and lowered herself over the edge until she was
seated securely in the loop. Bracing my feet against the wall, I
let her down rapidly until I felt the rope go slack in my
hands.</p>

<p>I then dragged her cot close beneath the window, passed the
free end of the rope beneath it and out the window, letting it
fall toward the roof below. This gave me two strands of rope
reaching to the roof with the middle part of the rope passing
around the cot which was too large to be dragged through the
window by my weight as I descended.</p>

<p>Grasping both strands firmly in my two hands, I slipped
through the window and slid quickly to the side of the waiting
girl; then I pulled in rapidly on one end of the rope, dragging
the free end around the cot until it fell to the roof. Thus I
retrieved the rope for use in descending the remainder of the way
to the ground.</p>

<p>We crossed the roof quickly to the edge overlooking the outer
courtyard into which we expected to descend. There was no one in
sight, and I was just about to lower the girl over the edge when
a loud shout from behind us startled us both.</p>

<p>Turning, we saw three of Skor's creatures looking at us from
an upper window of the castle on the opposite side of the inner
court. Almost as we turned, the three left the window and we
could hear them shouting through the castle.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" cried the girl. "We are lost! They will
come to the roof by the tower door, and they will have us
trapped. They were not the servants; they were three of his armed
men. I thought they had all accompanied him, but I was
wrong."</p>

<p>I said nothing, but I seized her hand and started toward the
far end of the castle roof. A sudden hope had flared within me,
born of an idea suggested by what the girl had told me of Duare's
escape.</p>

<p>We ran as fast as we could, and when we reached the edge we
looked down upon the river lapping the castle wall two stories
below. I passed the rope about the girl's waist. She asked no
question; she made no comment. Quickly she climbed over the low
parapet, and I commenced lowering her toward the river below.</p>

<p>Hideous mouthings arose behind me. I turned and saw three dead
men running toward me across the roof. Then I lowered away so
rapidly that the rope burned my fingers, but there was no time to
lose. I feared that they would be upon me before I could lower
the girl to the dubious safety of the swirling waters.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer sounded the hurrying footsteps and the
incoherent yammerings of the corpses. I heard a splash, and the
rope went slack in my fingers. I glanced behind. The nearest of
the creatures was already extending his hands to seize me. It was
one of those that I had noticed at the gate the day before; I
recognized it by the bloodless gash across its cheek. Its dead
eyes were expressionless&mdash;glazed and staring&mdash;but its
mouth was contorted in a ghastly snarl.</p>

<p>Immediate recapture faced me; there was but a single
alternative. I sprang to the top of the parapet and leaped. I
have always been a good diver, but I doubt that I ever made a
prettier swan dive in my life than I did that day from the
parapet of the gloomy castle of Skor, the jong of Morov.</p>

<p>As I rose to the surface of the river, shaking the water from
my eyes, I looked about for the girl; she was nowhere to be seen.
I knew that she could not have reached the river bank in the
short time that had elapsed since I had lowered her into the
water, for the masonry of the castle and the walls which extended
it both above and below the building offered not even a hand-hold
for hundreds of feet in both directions, and the opposite shore
was too far away.</p>

<p>I cast about me in all directions as the current carried me
down stream, and I saw her head rise above the surface of the
water a short distance below me. Swiftly I struck out for her.
She went down again just before I reached her, but I dived for
her and brought her to the surface. She was still conscious but
almost out. She lay very limp.</p>

<p>Glancing back at the castle, I saw that my would-be captors
had disappeared from the roof; and I guessed that they would
shortly appear on the bank of the river ready to seize us when we
emerged. But I had no intention of emerging on their side.</p>

<p>Dragging the girl with me, I struck out for the opposite
shore. The river here was considerably deeper and broader than at
the point we had first encountered it farther up stream. Now it
was quite a river. What strange creatures inhabited its depths I
had no means of knowing. I could only hope that none would
discover us.</p>

<p>The girl lay very quiet; she did not struggle at all. I began
to fear that she was dead and I exerted myself still more to
reach the bank quickly. The current bore us down stream, and I
was glad of that, for it was taking us farther away from the
castle and retainers of Skor.</p>

<p>At last I reached the bank and dragged the girl out onto a
little patch of pale violet grass and set to work to resuscitate
her, but even as I commenced she opened her eyes and looked up at
me. A shadow of a smile touched her lips.</p>

<p>"I shall be all right in a minute," she said weakly. "I was so
frightened."</p>

<p>"Don't you know how to swim?" I asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No."</p>

<p>"And you let me lower you into the river without telling me!"
I was amazed by the sheer bravery of her act.</p>

<p>"There was nothing else to do," she said simply. "Had I told
you, you would not have lowered me, and we both should have been
recaptured. I do not see even now how you got down before they
seized you."</p>

<p>"I dived," I explained.</p>

<p>"You jumped from the top of that castle? It is
incredible!"</p>

<p>"You do not come from a land where there is much water," I
commented with a laugh.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"If you did you would have seen enough diving to know that
mine was nothing extraordinary."</p>

<p>"My country is in a mountainous district," she admitted,
"where the streams are torrents and there is little
swimming."</p>

<p>"And where is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is very far," she replied. "I do not even know
where."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to get into Skor's country?"</p>

<p>"During a war in my country I was captured with others by the
enemy. They carried us down out of the mountains into a great
plain. One night two of us escaped. My companion was a soldier
who had been long in the service of my father. He was very loyal.
He tried to return me to my country, but we became lost. I do not
know how long we wandered, but at last we came to a great
river.</p>

<p>"Here were people who went in boats upon the river. They lived
in the boats, always fighting. They sought to capture us, and my
companion was killed defending me; then they took me. But I was
not with them long. The first night several men were quarreling
over me; each of them claimed me as his own. And while they
quarreled, I slipped into a small boat tied to the larger one and
floated away down the great river.</p>

<p>"I drifted for many days and nearly starved to death, although
I saw fruits and nuts growing along the banks of the river. But
the boat was without oars and was so heavy that I could not bring
it in to shore.</p>

<p>"Finally it ran aground by itself on a sand bar where the
river ran slowly about a great bend, and it chanced that Skor was
hunting near and saw me. That is all. I have been here a long
time."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE PYGMIES</a></h2>

<p class="first">As the girl finished her story I saw the three
dead men standing upon the opposite bank. For a moment they
hesitated, then they plunged into the river.</p>

<p>I seized the girl by the hand and raised her to her feet. Our
only defense lay in flight. Although I had had to abandon my
spear, I had saved my bow and arrows, the latter being tied
securely in my quiver while the former I had looped across one
shoulder before leaving the tower; but of what use were arrows
against dead men?</p>

<p>Casting another glance toward our pursuers I saw them
floundering in the deep water of the channel, and it became
immediately evident that none of them could swim. They were
bobbing around helplessly as the current swept them down stream.
Sometimes they floated on their backs, sometimes on their
faces. Most of the time their heads were under water.</p>

<p>"We haven't much to fear from them," I said; "they will all
drown."</p>

<p>"They cannot drown," replied the girl with a shudder.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that," I admitted. "But at least there is
little likelihood that they will reach this shore; certainly not
before they have been carried a long distance down stream. We
shall have plenty of time to escape them."</p>

<p>"Then let's be going. I hate this place. I want to get away
from it."</p>

<p>"I cannot go away until I have found Duare," I told her. "I
must search for her."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is right; we must try to find her. But where shall
we look?"</p>

<p>"She would try to reach the big river and follow it to the
sea," I explained, "and I think that she would reason much as we
would, that it would be safer to follow this stream down to the
larger one inasmuch as then she would have the concealing
protection of the forest."</p>

<p>"We shall have to keep careful watch for the dead men,"
cautioned the girl. "If they wash ashore on this side we shall be
sure to meet them."</p>

<p>"Yes; and I want to make sure where they do come ashore,
because I intend crossing over and hunting for Duare on the other
side."</p>

<p>For some time we moved cautiously down stream in silence, both
constantly alert for any sound that might portend danger. My mind
was filled with thoughts of Duare and apprehension for her
safety, yet occasionally it reverted to the girl at my side; and
I could not but recall her courage during our escape and her
generous willingness to delay her own flight that we might search
for Duare. It was apparent that her character formed a trinity of
loveliness with her form and her face. And I did not even know
her name!</p>

<p>That fact struck me as being as remarkable as that I had only
known her for an hour. So intimate are the bonds of mutual
adversity and danger that it seemed I had known her always, that
that hour was indeed an eternity.</p>

<p>"Do you realize," I asked, turning toward her, "that neither
of us knows the other's name?" And then I told her mine.</p>

<p>"Carson Napier!" she repeated. "That is a strange name."</p>

<p>"And what is yours?"</p>

<p>"Nalte voo jan kum Baltoo," she replied, which means Nalte,
the daughter of Baltoo. "The people call me Voo Jan, but my
friends call me Nalte."</p>

<p>"And what am I to call you?" I asked.</p>

<p>She looked at me in surprise. "Why, Nalte, of course."</p>

<p>"I am honored by being included among your friends."</p>

<p>"But are you not my best, my only friend now in all
Amtor?"</p>

<p>I had to admit that her reasoning was sound, since as far as
all the rest of Amtor was concerned we were the only two people
on that cloud-girt planet, and we were certainly not enemies.</p>

<p><br>We were moving cautiously along within sight of the river
when Nalte suddenly touched my arm and pointed toward the
opposite bank, at the same time dragging me down behind a
shrub.</p>

<p>Just opposite us a corpse had washed ashore; and a short
distance below, two others. They were our pursuers. As we
watched, they slowly crawled to their feet; then the one we had
first seen called to the others, who presently joined him. The
three corpses talked together, pointing and gesticulating. It was
horrible. I felt my skin creep.</p>

<p>What would they do? Would they continue the search or would
they return to the castle? If the former, they would have to
cross the river; and they must already have learned that there
was little likelihood of their being able to do that. But that
was attributing to dead brains the power to reason! It seemed
incredible. I asked Nalte what she thought about it, for she
knew more about them than I.</p>

<p>"It is a mystery to me," she replied. "They converse, and they
appear to reason. At first I thought they were motivated through
the hypnotic influence of Skor's mind solely&mdash;that they
thought his thoughts, as it were; but they take independent
action when Skor is away, as you have seen them do today, which
refutes that theory. Skor says that they do reason. He has
stimulated their nervous systems into the semblance of life,
though no blood flows in their veins; but the past experiences of
their lives before they died are less potent in influencing their
judgments than the new system of conduct and ethics that Skor has
instilled into their dead brains. He admits that the specimens he
has at the castle are very dull; but that, he insists, is because
they were dull people in life."</p>

<p>The dead men conversed for some time and then started slowly
up river in the direction of the castle, and it was with a sigh
of relief that we saw them disappear.</p>

<p>"Now we must try to find a good place to cross," I said. "I
wish to search the other side for some sign of Duare. She must
have left footprints in the soft earth."</p>

<p>"There is a ford somewhere down river," said Nalte. "When Skor
captured me we crossed it on our way to the castle. I do not know
just where it is, but it cannot be far."</p>

<p>We had descended the river some two miles from the point at
which we had seen the dead man emerge upon the opposite bank,
without seeing any sign of a crossing, when I heard faintly a
familiar cackling that seemed to come from across the river and
farther down.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that?" I asked Nalte. I was sure that I
recognized it. </p>

<p>She listened intently for a moment as the cackling grew
louder. "Yes," she replied&mdash;"the kazars. We had better
hide."</p>

<p><br>Acting upon Nalte's suggestion we concealed ourselves
behind a clump of underbrush and waited. The cackling grew in
volume, and we knew that the kazars were approaching.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that it is Skor's pack?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It must be," she replied. "There is no other pack in this
vicinity, according to Skor."</p>

<p>"Nor any wild kazars?"</p>

<p>"No. He says that there are no wild ones on this side of the
big river. They range on the opposite side. These must be
Skor's!"</p>

<p>We waited in silence as the sounds approached, and presently
we saw the new leader of the pack trot into view on the opposite
bank. Behind him strung several more of the grotesque beasts, and
then came Skor, mounted on his zorat, with the dead men that
formed his retinue surrounding him.</p>

<a id="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>
<div align="center">
<img src="0300201h-images/LostOnVenus-4.jpg"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">And then came Skor.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Duare is not there!" whispered Nalte. "Skor did not recapture
her."</p>

<p>We watched Skor and his party until they had passed out of
sight among the trees of the forest on the other side of the
river, and it was with a sigh of relief that I saw what I hoped
would be the last of the jong of Morov.</p>

<p>While I was relieved to know that Duare had not been
recaptured, I was still but little less apprehensive concerning
her fate. Many dangers might beset her, alone and unprotected in
this savage land; and I had only the vaguest conception of where
to search for her.</p>

<p>After the passing of Skor we had continued on down the river,
and presently Nalte pointed ahead to a line of ripples that
stretched from bank to bank where the river widened.</p>

<p>"There is the ford," she said, "but there is no use crossing
it to look for Duare's trail. If she had escaped on that side of
the river the kazars would have found her before now. The fact
that they didn't find her is fairly good proof that she was never
over there."</p>

<p>I was not so sure of that. I did not know that Duare could
swim nor that she could not, but the chances were highly in favor
of the latter possibility, since Duare had been born and reared
in the tree city of Kooaad  a thousand feet or more above the
ground, Yet I could not understand why the kazar pack had not
picked up her trail.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they found her and killed her," I suggested,
horrified at the very thought of such a tragedy.</p>

<p>"No," dissented Nalte. "Skor would have prevented that; he
wanted her."</p>

<p>"But something else might have killed her; they might have
found her dead body."</p>

<p>"Skor would have brought it back with him and invested it with
the synthetic life that animates his retinue of dead," argued
Nalte.</p>

<p>Still I was not convinced. "How do the kazars trail?" I asked.
"Do they follow the spoor of their quarry by scent?"</p>

<p>Nalte shook her head. "Their sense of smell is extremely poor,
but their vision is acute. In trailing, they depend wholly upon
their eyes."</p>

<p>"Then it is possible that they might not have crossed Duare's
trail at all and so missed her."</p>

<p>"Possible, but not probable," replied Nalte. "What is more
probable is that she was killed and devoured by some beast before
Skor was able to recapture her."</p>

<p>That explanation had already occurred to me, but I did not
wish to even think about it. "Nevertheless," I said, "we might as
well cross over to the other bank. If we are going to follow the
big river down stream we shall have to cross this affluent sooner
or later, and we may not find another ford as it grows broader
and deeper toward its mouth."</p>

<p><br>The ford was broad and well marked by ripples, so we had
no difficulty in following it toward the opposite bank. However,
we were compelled to keep our eyes on the water most of the time
as the ford took two curves that formed a flattened S, and it
would have been quite easy to have stepped off into deep water
and been swept down stream had we not been careful.</p>

<p>The result of our constant watchfulness approached disaster as
we neared the left bank of the stream. The merest chance caused
me to look up. I was slightly in advance of Nalte as we walked
hand in hand for greater safety. I stopped so suddenly at what I
saw that the girl bumped into me. Then she looked up, and a
little, involuntary cry of alarm burst from her lips.</p>

<p>"What are they?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I replied. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>"No; I never saw such creatures before."</p>

<p>At the edge of the water, awaiting us, were half a dozen
manlike creatures, while others like them were coming from the
forest, dropping from the trees to shuffle awkwardly toward the
ford. They were about three feet tall and entirely covered with
long hair. At first I thought that they were monkeys, although
they bore a startling resemblance to human beings, but when they
saw that we had discovered them one of them spoke, and the simian
theory was exploded.</p>

<p>"I am Ul," said the speaker. "Go away from the land of Ul. I
am Ul; I kill!"</p>

<p>"We will not harm you," I replied. "We only want to pass
through your country."</p>

<p>"Go away!" growled Ul, baring sharp fighting fangs.</p>

<p>By now, fifty of the fierce little men were gathered at the
water's edge, growling, menacing. They were without clothing or
ornaments and carried no weapons, but their sharp fangs and the
bulging muscles of their shoulders and arms bespoke their ability
to carry out Ul's threats.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" demanded Nalte. "They will tear us
to pieces the moment we step out of the water."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can persuade them to let us pass," I said, but
after five minutes of fruitless effort I had to admit defeat.
Ul's only reply to my arguments was, "Go away! I kill! I
kill!"</p>

<p>I hated to turn back, for I knew that we must cross the river
eventually and we might not find such another crossing, but at
last, reluctantly, I retraced my steps to the right bank hand in
hand with Nalte. As we reached the shore, we glanced bck; there
stood the little, hairy men watching us in silence; then we
turned into the forest and saw them no more.</p>

<p>All the remainder of the day I searched for traces of Duare as
we followed the course of the river downward, but my efforts were
without success. I was disheartened. I felt that I should never
see her again. Nalte tried to cheer me up, but inasmuch as she
believed that Duare was dead she was not very successful.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I succeeded in killing a small animal.
As we had eaten nothing all that day we were both famished, so we
soon had a fire going and were grilling cuts of the tender
meat.</p>

<p>After we had eaten I built a rude platform among the branches
of a large tree and gathered a number of huge leaves to serve as
mattress and covering, and as darkness fell Nalte and I settled
ourselves, not uncomfortably, in our lofty sanctuary.</p>

<p><br>For a while we were silent, wrapped in our own thoughts.
I do not know about Nalte's, but mine were gloomy enough. I
cursed the day that I had conceived the idea to build the huge
torpedo that had carried me from Earth to Venus, and in the next
thought I blessed it because it had made it possible for me to
know and to love Duare.</p>

<p>It was Nalte who broke the silence. As though she had read my
thoughts, she said, "You loved Duare very much?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>Nalte sighed. "It must be sad to lose one's mate."</p>

<p>"She was not my mate."</p>

<p>"Not your mate!" Nalte's tone expressed her surprise. "But you
loved one another?"</p>

<p>"Duare did not love me," I replied. "At least she said she
didn't. You see, she was the daughter of a jong and she couldn't
love any one until after she was twenty."</p>

<p>Nalte laughed. "Love does not come or go in accordance with
any laws or customs," she said.</p>

<p>"But even if Duare had loved me, which she didn't, she
couldn't have said so; she couldn't even talk of love because she
was the daughter of a jong and too young. I don't understand it,
of course, but that is because I am from another world and know
nothing of your customs."</p>

<p>"I am nineteen," said Nalte, "and the daughter of a jong, but
if I loved a man I should say so."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the customs of your country and those of Duare's are
not the same," I suggested.</p>

<p>"They must be very different," agreed Nalte, "for in my
country a man does not speak to a girl of love until she has told
him that she loves him; and the daughter of the jong chooses her
own mate whenever she pleases."</p>

<p>"That custom may have its advantages," I admitted, "but if I
loved a girl I should want the right to tell her so."</p>

<p>"Oh, the men find ways of letting a girl know without putting
it into words. I could tell if a man loved me, but if I loved him
very much I wouldn't wait for that."</p>

<p>"And what if he didn't love you?" I asked.</p>

<p>Nalte tossed her head. "I'd make him."</p>

<p>I could readily understand that Nalte might be a very
difficult young person not to love. She was slender and dark,
with an olive skin and a mass of black hair in lovely disorder.
Her eyes sparkled with health and intelligence. Her features were
regular and almost boyish, and over all was the suggestion of a
veil of dignity that bespoke her blood. I could not doubt but
that she was the daughter of a jong. It seemed to be my fate to
encounter daughters of jongs. I said as much to Nalte.</p>

<p>"How many have you met?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Two," I replied, "you and Duare."</p>

<p>"That is not very many when you consider how many jongs there
must be in Amtor and how many daughters they must have. My father
has seven."</p>

<p>"Are they all as lovely as you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Do you think me lovely?"</p>

<p>"You know you are."</p>

<p>"But I like to hear people say so. I like to hear you say it,"
she added softly.</p>

<p>The roars of hunting beasts came up to us from the dim forest
aisles, the screams of stricken prey; then the silence of the
night broken only by the murmuring of the river rolling down to
some unknown sea.</p>

<p>I was considering a tactful reply to Nalte's ingenuous
observation when I dozed and fell asleep.</p>

<p><br>I felt some one shaking me by the shoulder. I opened my
eyes to look up into Nalte's. "Are you going to sleep all day?"
she demanded with a laugh.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight. I sat up and looked around. "We have
survived another night," I said.</p>

<p>"And face another day of&mdash;what?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Who knows?"</p>

<p>I gathered some fruit, and we cooked some more of the meat
left from my kill of the previous day. We had a splendid
breakfast, and then we set off again down stream in our quest
for&mdash;what?</p>

<p>"If we do not find Duare to-day," I said, "I shall have to
admit that she is irrevocably lost to me."</p>

<p>"And then what?" asked Nalte.</p>

<p>"You would like to return to your own country?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then we shall start up the big river toward your home."</p>

<p>"We shall never reach it," said Nalte, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that we might be very happy while we were
trying to reach Andoo," she said.</p>

<p>"Andoo?" I queried.</p>

<p>"That is my country," she explained. "The mountains of Andoo
are very beautiful."</p>

<p>There was a note of wistfulness in her voice; her eyes were
contemplating a scene that mine could not see. Suddenly I
realized how brave the girl had been, how cheerful she had
remained through the hardships and menacing dangers of our
flight, all despite the probably hopelessness of her situation. I
touched her hand gently.</p>

<p>"We shall do our best to return you to the beautiful mountains
of Andoo," I assured her.</p>

<p>Nalte shook her head. "I shall never see them again, Carson. A
great company of warriors might not survive the dangers that lie
between here and Andoo&mdash;a thousand kobs of fierce and
hostile country."</p>

<p>"A thousand kobs is a long way," I agreed. "It does seem
hopeless, but we'll not give up."</p>

<p>The Amtorians divide the circumference of a circle into a
thousand parts to arrive at their hita, or degree; and the kob is
one tenth of a degree of longitude at the equator (or what the
Amtorians call The Small Circle), roughly about two and a half
earth miles; therefore a thousand kobs would be about two
thousand five hundred miles.</p>

<p>A little mental arithmetic convinced me that Nalte could not
have drifted down the big river two thousand five hundred miles
without food, and I asked her if she was sure that Andoo was that
far away.</p>

<p>"No," she admitted, "but it seems that far. We wandered a long
time before we reached the river, and then I drifted for so long
that I lost track of time."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if we found Duare, I was going to be faced by a
problem. One girl must go down the valley in search of her own
country, the other up the valley! And only one of them had even a
hazy idea of where her country lay!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10">X. &mdash; THE LAST SECOND</a></h2>

<p class="first">During the afternoon of the second day of our
search for Duare, Nalte and I came to the big river that Duare and
I had seen from the summit of the escarpment, the same river down
which Nalte had drifted into the clutches of Skor.</p>

<p>And it was a big river, comparable to the Mississippi. It ran
between low cliffs of gleaming white limestone, flowing silently
out of the mystery above, flowing silently toward the mystery
below. Upon its broad expanse, from where it swept majestically
into sight around a low promontory to where it disappeared again
beyond a curve down stream, there was no sign of life, nor on
either bank&mdash;only the girl, Nalte, and I. I felt the awe of
its grandeur and my own insignificance.</p>

<p>I had no words to express my thoughts; and I was glad that
Nalte stood in silence that was almost reverential as we viewed
the majesty and the desolation of the scene.</p>

<p>Presently the girl sighed. It awoke me to the need of the
moment. I could not stand mooning there in the face of the
immediate necessity that confronted us.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "this is not crossing the river." I referred
to the affluent that we had followed down from the castle of
Skor.</p>

<p>"I am glad that we do not have to cross the big river,"
remarked Nalte.</p>

<p>"We may have enough trouble crossing this other," I
suggested.</p>

<p>It flowed at our left, making a sudden turn before it emptied
into the larger stream. Below us was a great eddy that had strewn
the nearer bank with flotsam&mdash;leaves, twigs, branches of all
sizes, and even the boles of great trees. These things appeared
to have been deposited during a period of high water.</p>

<p>"How are we going to cross?" asked Nalte. "There is no ford,
and it seems too wide and swift to swim even if I were a good
swimmer." She looked up at me quickly then as a new thought
seemed to strike her. "I am a burden to you," she said. "If you
were alone you would doubtless be able to cross easily. Pay no
attention to me; I shall remain on this side and start up the
river on my journey toward Andoo, while you cross and search
for Duare." </p>

<p>I looked down at her and smiled. "You really do not believe or
hope that I will do anything of the sort."</p>

<p>"It would be the sensible thing to do," she said.</p>

<p>"The sensible thing to do is to build a raft with some of that
stuff down there and float across the river." I pointed to the
débris piled up on the bank.</p>

<p>"Why, we could do that, couldn't we?" she cried.</p>

<p>She was all eagerness and excitement now, and a moment later
she pitched in and helped me drag out such pieces as I thought we
could use in the construction of a raft.</p>

<p>It was hard work, but at last we had enough material to float
us in safety. The next job was to fasten the elements of our
prospective raft together so securely that the river could not
tear it to pieces before we had gained the opposite bank.</p>

<p>We gathered lianas for that purpose, and though we worked as
rapidly as we could it was almost dark before we had completed
our rude ferry.</p>

<p>As I contemplated the fruit of our labor, I saw Nalte
surveying the swirling waters of the eddy with a dubious eye.</p>

<p>"Are we going to cross now," she asked, "or wait until
morning?"</p>

<p>"It is almost dark now," I replied. "I think we had better
wait until tomorrow."</p>

<p>She brightened visibly and drew a deep sigh of relief. "Then
we had better think about eating now," she said. I had found the
girls of Venus not unlike their earthly sisters in this
respect.</p>

<p>The meal that night was a matter of fruit and tubers, but it
was sufficient. Once more I constructed a platform among the
branches of a tree and prayed that no prowling arboreal carnivore
would discover us.</p>

<p><br>Each morning that I awoke on Venus it was with a sense of
surprise that I still lived, and this first morning on the big
river was no exception.</p>

<p>As soon as we had eaten we went to our raft, and after some
difficulty succeeded in launching it. I had equipped it with
several long branches for poling and some shorter ones that we
might use as oars after we got into the deep channel, but they
were most inadequate makeshifts. I was depending almost
exclusively on the eddy to carry us within striking distance of
the opposite shore, where I hoped that we would then be able to
pole the raft to the bank.</p>

<p>Our craft floated much better than I had anticipated. I had
feared that it would be almost awash and most uncomfortable; but
the wood was evidently light, with the result that the top of the
raft was several inches above the water.</p>

<p>No sooner had we shoved off than the eddy seized us and
commenced to bear us up stream and out toward the center. Our
only concern now was to keep from being drawn into the vortex,
and by poling frantically we managed to keep near the periphery
of the whirlpool until the water deepened to such a degree that
our poles would no longer touch bottom; then we seized the
shorter branches and paddled desperately. It was gruelling work,
yet Nalte never faltered.</p>

<p>At last we swung in toward the left bank, and once more we
seized our poles, but, to my astonishment and chagrin, I
discovered that the water here was still too deep. The current,
too, was much stronger on this side than on the other; and our
futile oars were almost useless.</p>

<p>Remorselessly the river held us in its grip and dragged us
back toward the vortex. We paddled furiously, and held our own;
we were keeping away from the center of the eddy, but we were
being carried farther from the left bank.</p>

<p>Presently we were in mid-channel. We seemed to be hanging on
the very edge of the eddy. Both of us were almost exhausted by
this time, yet we might not pause for an instant. With a last,
supreme effort we tore the raft from the clutches of the current
that would have drawn us back into the embrace of the swirling
Titan; then the main current of the mid-channel seized us&mdash;a
fierce, relentless force. Our craft swirled and bobbed about
absolutely beyond control, and we were swept down toward the
great river.</p>

<p>I laid aside my inadequate paddle. "We have done our best,
Nalte," I said, "but it wasn't good enough. Now all that we can
do is to hope that this thing will hang together until we drift
to one shore or the other somewhere along the big river."</p>

<p>"It will have to be soon," said Nalte.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"When Skor found me he said that I was fortunate to have come
to shore where I did, as farther down the river tumbles over
falls."</p>

<p>I looked at the low cliffs that lined the river on both sides.
"There isn't any chance of making a landing here," I said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall have better luck lower down," suggested
Nalte.</p>

<p>Down we drifted with the current, sometimes borne close to one
shore, sometimes close to the other as the channel meandered from
bank to bank; or again we rode far out on the center of the
flood. Sometimes we saw little breaks in the cliffs where we
might have made a landing; but we always saw them too late, and
were carried past before we could maneuver our clumsy craft
within reach.</p>

<p><br>As we approached each bend we looked expectantly for some
change in the shore line that would offer us some hope of
landing, but always we were disappointed. And then, at last, as
we swung around a headland, we saw two cities. One lay upon the
left bank of the river, the other on the right directly opposite.
The former appeared gray and drab even at a distance, while that
upon the right bank shone white and beautiful and gay with its
limestone walls and towers and its roofs of many colors.</p>

<p>Nalte nodded toward the city on the left bank. "That must be
Kormor; this is about the location that Skor told me his city
occupied."</p>

<p>"And the other?" I asked. "What is that?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Skor never mentioned another city."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is all one city built upon both banks of the
river," I suggested.</p>

<p>"No; I do not think so. Skor told me that the people who dwelt
across the river from Kormor were his enemies, but he never said
anything about a city. I thought it was just some savage tribe.
Why, that is a splendid city&mdash;far larger and handsomer than
Kormor."</p>

<p>We could not, of course, see the entire expanse of either
city, but as we drifted closer it was apparent that the city on
our right extended along the river front for several miles. This
we could see because at this point the river ran almost as
straight as a canal for a greater distance than I could see. But
the city on our left, which was Kormor, was much smaller,
extending but about a mile along the water front. As far as we
could see both cities were walled, a high wall extending along
the river side of each. Kormor had a short quay in front of a
gate about the center of this wall, while the quay of the other
city appeared to be a long avenue extending as far as I could
see.</p>

<p>We had been drifting for some time opposite the right hand
city before we came close to Kormor. There were a few fishermen
on the long quay of the former city, and others, possibly
sentries, on top of the wall behind them. Many of these saw us
and pointed at us and seemed to be discussing us, but at no time
did we drift close enough to that side of the river so that we
could obtain a close view of them.</p>

<p>As we came down toward the quay of Kormor, a small boat pushed
out into the river. It contained three men, two of whom were
rowing while the third stood in the bow. That they were pulling
out to intercept us appeared quite evident.</p>

<p>"They are Skor's men," said Nalte.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they want of us?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To capture us, of course, for Skor; but they will never
capture me!" She stepped toward the edge of the raft.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I demanded. "What are you going to
do?"</p>

<p>"I am going to jump into the river."</p>

<p>"But you can't swim," I objected. "You will be sure to
drown."</p>

<p>"That is what I wish to do. I shall never let Skor take me
again."</p>

<p>"Wait, Nalte," I begged. "They haven't taken us yet. Perhaps
they won't."</p>

<p>"Yes, they will," she said hopelessly.</p>

<p>"We must never give up hope, Nalte. Promise me that you will
wait. Even in the last second you can still carry out your
plan."</p>

<p>"I will wait," she promised, "but in the last second you had
better follow my example and join me in death rather than fall
into the hands of Skor and become one of those hopeless creatures
that you saw at his castle, for then you will be denied even the
final escape of death."</p>

<p>The boat was now approaching closer, and I hailed its
occupants. "What do you want of us?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"You must come ashore with us," said the man in the bow.</p>

<p><br>I was close enough now so that I could get a good look at
the fellow. I had thought at first that they were some more of
Skor's living dead, but now I saw that this fellow's cheeks had
the hue of health and blood.</p>

<p>"We will not come with you," I called back to him. "Leave us
alone; we are not harming you. Let us go our way in peace."</p>

<p>"You will come ashore with us," said the man, as his boat drew
closer.</p>

<p>"Keep away, or I'll kill you!" I cried, fitting an arrow to my
bow.</p>

<p>The fellow laughed&mdash;a dry, mirthless laugh. Then it was
that I saw his eyes, and a cold chill swept over me. They were
the dead eyes of a corpse!</p>

<p>I loosed an arrow. It drove straight through the creature's
chest, but he only laughed again and left the arrow sticking
there.</p>

<p>"Do you not know," cried Nalte, "that you cannot kill the
dead?" She stepped to the far side of the raft. "Good-by,
Carson," she said quietly; "the last second is here!"</p>

<p>"No! No, Nalte!" I cried. "Wait! It is not the last
second."</p>

<p>I turned again toward the approaching boat. Its bow was
already within a foot of the raft. Before the fellow standing in
it could grasp my intention I leaped upon him. He struck at me
with his dead hands; his dead fingers clutched for my throat. But
my attack had been too quick and unexpected. I had carried him
off his balance, and in the same instant I seized him and threw
him overboard.</p>

<p>The two other creatures had been rowing with their backs
toward the bow and were unaware that any danger threatened them
until I crashed upon their leader. As he went overboard the
nearer of the others rose and turned upon me. His skin, too, was
painted in the semblance of life, but those dead eyes could not
be changed.</p>

<p>With a horrid, inarticulate scream he leaped for me. I met his
rush with a right to the jaw that would have knocked a living man
down for a long count; and while, of course, I couldn't knock the
thing out, I did knock it overboard.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the two in the water convinced me that my
guess had not been amiss&mdash;like their fellows at the castle,
the two could not swim and were floating helplessly down stream
with the current. But there was still another, and it was
stepping across the thwarts toward me.</p>

<p>I sprang forward to meet it, ripping in a blow toward the side
of the jaw that would have sent it after the other two had it
connected; but it did not. Our movements caused the boat to rock
and threw me off my balance, and before I could regain my
equilibrium the creature seized me.</p>

<p>It was very powerful, but it fought without fire or
enthusiasm&mdash;just the cold, deadly application of force. It
reached for my throat; to reach for its throat was useless. I
could not choke the life from something that had no life. The
best that I could do was to try to evade its clutches and wait
for an opening that might never come.</p>

<p>I am rather muscular myself; and I did manage to push the
thing from me for a moment, but it came right back. It didn't say
anything; it didn't make any sound at all. There was no
expression in its glazed eyes, but its dry lips were drawn back
over yellow teeth in a snarling grimace. The sight of it and the
touch of those cold, clammy fingers almost unnerved
me&mdash;these and the strange odor that emanated from it, the
strange odor that is the odor of death. It was sickening.</p>

<p>As it came toward me the second time it came with lowered head
and outstretched arms. I leaped for it, and locked my right arm
about its head from above. The back of its neck was snug against
my armpit as I seized my own right wrist with my left hand and
locked my hold tighter. Then I swung quickly around,
straightening up as I did so and, incidentally, nearly capsizing
the boat. The creature lost its footing as I swung it about; its
arms flailed wildly, as with a last mighty surge I released my
hold and sent it stumbling over the gunwale into the river. Like
the others, it floated away helpless.</p>

<p><br>A few yards away, the raft was drifting with Nalte wide-
eyed and tense with excitement. Seizing an oar I brought the boat
alongside and extending a hand assisted Nalte over the side. I
noticed that she was trembling.</p>

<p>"Frightened?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For you, yes. I didn't think that you had a chance against
three of them. Even now I can't believe what I saw. It is
incredible that one man could have done what you did."</p>

<p>"Luck had a lot to do with it," I replied, "and the fact that
I took them by surprise. They weren't expecting anything of the
sort."</p>

<p>"How strangely things happen," mused Nalte. "A moment ago I
was about to drown myself in sheer desperation, and now
everything is changed. The danger is over, and instead of an
inadequate raft we have a comfortable boat."</p>

<p>"Which proves that one should never give up hope."</p>

<p>"I shan't again&mdash;while you are with me," she promised.</p>

<p>I had been keeping an eye on the Kormor quay rather expecting
to see another boat put out in pursuit of us, but none did.
The fishermen and the sentries on the waterfront of the other
city had all stopped what they were doing and were watching
us.</p>

<p>"Shall we row over there and see if they will take us in?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," replied Nalte. "We have a saying in Andoo that
the farther strangers are away the better friends they are."</p>

<p>"You think that they would harm us?" I asked.</p>

<p>Nalte shrugged. "I do not know, but the chances are that they
would kill you and keep me."</p>

<p>"Then we won't take the chance, but I would like to remain
near here for a while and search for Duare."</p>

<p>"You can't land on the left bank until we are out of sight of
Kormor," said Nalte, "or they would be after us in no time."</p>

<p>"And if we land in sight of this other city these people would
take after us, if what you fear be true."</p>

<p>"Let's go down stream until we are out of sight of both
cities," suggested the girl, "and then wait until night before
coming back near Kormor to search, for that is where you will
have to search for Duare."</p>

<p>Following Nalte's suggestion we drifted slowly down stream. We
soon passed Kormor, but the white city on the right bank extended
on for a couple of miles farther. I should say that its full
length along the river front was fully five miles, and along all
that length was the broad quay backed by a gleaming white wall
pierced by an occasional gate&mdash;I counted six or seven along
the full length of the water front.</p>

<p>Just below the city the river turned to the right, and almost
immediately the cliffs shut off our view of both cities.
Simultaneously the aspect of the country changed. The limestone
cliffs ended abruptly, the river running between low banks. Here
it spread out to considerable width, but farther ahead I could
see where it narrowed again and entered a gorge between cliffs
much higher than any that we had passed. They were wooded cliffs,
and even from a distance I could see that they were not of the
white limestone that formed those with which we had now become
familiar.</p>

<p>There came to my ears faintly an insistent sound that was at
first little more than a murmur, but as we drifted down the river
it seemed to grow constantly in volume.</p>

<p>"Do you hear what I hear?" I demanded, "or am I the victim of
head noises?"</p>

<p>"That distant roaring?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it has become a roar now. What do you suppose it can
be?"</p>

<p>"It must be the falls that Skor told me of," said Nalte.</p>

<p>"By Jove! That's just what it is," I exclaimed. "And the best
thing that we can do is to get to shore while we can."</p>

<p>The current had carried us closer to the right bank at this
point, and just ahead of us I saw a small stream emptying into
the river. There was an open forest on the farther side of the
stream and scattered trees on the nearer.</p>

<p>It appeared an ideal location for a camp.</p>

<p>We made the shore easily, for the current here was not swift.
I ran the boat into the mouth of the small stream, but there was
not water enough to float it. However, I managed to drag it up
far enough to tie it to an overhanging limb of a tree where it
was out of sight of any possible pursuers from Kormor who might
come down the river in search of us.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "the thing that interests me most at present is
securing food."</p>

<p>"That is something that always interests me," admitted Nalte,
with a laugh. "Where are you going to hunt? That forest on the
other side of this little stream looks as though it should be
filled with game."</p>

<p>She was facing the forest as she spoke, while my back was
toward it. Suddenly the expression on her face changed, and she
seized my arm with a little cry of alarm. "Look, Carson! What is
that?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11">XI. &mdash; TO LIVE OR DIE?</a></h2>

<p class="first">As I turned at Nalte's warning cry, I thought
that I saw something dodge behind low bushes on the opposite
bank.</p>

<p>"What was it, Nalte?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, it couldn't be what I thought I saw," she whispered
excitedly. "I must be mistaken."</p>

<p>"What did you think you saw?"</p>

<p>"There's another&mdash;there&mdash;look!" she cried.</p>

<p>And then I saw it. It stepped from behind the bole of a large
tree and stood eyeing us, its fangs bared in a snarl. It was a
man that went on four feet like a beast. Its hind legs were
short, and it walked on its hind toes, the heels corresponding to
the hocks of animals. Its hands were more human, and it walked
flat on the palms of them in front. Its nose was flat, its mouth
broad, and its heavy, undershot jaws were armed with powerful
teeth. Its eyes were small and close set and extremely savage.
Its skin was white and almost hairless except upon its head and
jowls.</p>

<p>"You don't know what they are?" I asked Nalte.</p>

<p>"We have heard of them in Andoo, but no one ever believed that
they existed. They are called zangans. If the stories I have
heard are true they are terribly ferocious. They hunt in packs
and devour men as well as beasts."</p>

<p>Zangan means beast-man, and no better word could have been
coined to describe the creature that faced us across that little
stream in far Noobol. And now others came slinking into view from
the shelter of bushes and from behind the boles of trees.</p>

<p>"I think we had better hunt elsewhere," I said in a weak
effort to be jocose.</p>

<p>"Let's take to the boat again," suggested Nalte.</p>

<p>We had already walked a little distance from the spot where I
had moored our craft, and as we turned to retrace our steps I saw
several of the zangans enter the water on the opposite side and
approach the boat. They were much closer to it than we, and long
before I could untie it and drag it into deeper water they could
be upon us.</p>

<p>"It is too late!" cried Nalte.</p>

<p>"Let's fall back slowly to that little rise of ground behind
us," I said. "Perhaps I can hold them off there."</p>

<p>We retreated slowly, watching the zangans as they crossed the
stream toward us. When they came out on shore they shook
themselves as dogs do, and then they came slinking after us
again. They reminded me of tigers&mdash;human tigers&mdash;and
their gait was much that of a stalking tiger as they approached
with flattened heads and snarling lips.</p>

<p>They growled and snapped at one another, revealing a
viciousness greater than that of beasts. Momentarily I expected a
charge, and I knew that when it came Nalte's troubles and mine
would be over forever. We wouldn't have even a fighting chance
against that savage pack.</p>

<p>There were about twenty of them, mostly males; but there were
a couple of females and two or three half grown cubs. On the back
of one of the females rode a baby, its arms tightly hugging the
neck of its mother.</p>

<p>Savage as they appeared, they followed us warily as though
they were half afraid of us; but their long, easy strides were
constantly cutting down the distance between us.</p>

<p><br>When we reached the little mound toward which we had been
retreating they were still fifty yards behind us. As we started
to ascend the rise a large male trotted forward, voicing a low
roar. It was as though it had just occurred to him that we might
be trying to escape and that he ought to try to prevent it.</p>

<p>I stopped and faced him, fitting an arrow to my bow. Drawing
the shaft back to the very tip I let him have it squarely in the
chest. He stopped in his tracks, roared horribly, and clawed at
the feathered end protruding from his body; then he came on
again; but he was staggering, and presently he sank to the
ground, struggled for a moment, and lay still.</p>

<p>The others had stopped and were watching him. Suddenly a young
male ran up to him and bit him savagely about the head and neck;
then raised his head and voiced a hideous roar. I guessed that it
was a challenge as I saw him look about him at the other members
of the pack. Here, perhaps, was a new leader usurping the powers
of the one who had fallen.</p>

<p>Apparently no one was prepared to question his authority, and
now he turned his attention again to us. He did not advance
directly toward us, but slunk off to one side. As he did so he
turned and growled at his fellows. That he was communicating
orders to them at once became evident, for immediately they
spread out as though to surround us.</p>

<p>I loosed another arrow then, this time at the new leader. I
struck him in the side and elicited such a roar of pain and rage
as I hope I may never hear again&mdash;at least not under such
circumstances.</p>

<p>Reaching back with one hand the beast man seized the shaft and
tore it from his body, inflicting a far more serious hurt than
the arrow had made in entering; and now his roars and screams
fairly shook the ground.</p>

<p>The others paused to watch him, and I saw one large male slink
slowly toward the wounded leader. The latter saw him, too; and
with bared fangs and ferocious growls charged him. The ambitious
one, evidently realizing that his hopes had been premature,
wheeled and fled; and the new chief let him go and turned again
toward us.</p>

<p>By this time we were three-quarters surrounded. There were
nearly twenty ferocious beasts confronting us, and I had less
than a dozen arrows.</p>

<p>Nalte touched me on the arm. "Good-by, Carson," she said.
"Now, surely, the last second is upon us."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "I am saving the last second in which to
die," I replied. "Until then I shall not admit that there is ever
to be a last second for me, and then it will be too late to
matter."</p>

<p>"I admire your courage if not your reasoning," said Nalte, the
ghost of a smile on her lips. "But at least it will be a quick
death&mdash;did you see how that fellow tore at the throat of the
first one you shot? It is better than what Skor would have done
to us."</p>

<p>"At least we shall be dead," I observed.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" cried Nalte.</p>

<p>They were closing in on us now from three sides. Arrow after
arrow I drove into them, nor once did I miss my mark; but they
only stopped those that I hit&mdash;the others came on.</p>

<p>They were almost upon us as I loosed my last arrow. Nalte was
standing close beside me. I put an arm about her.</p>

<p>"Hold me close," she said. "I am not afraid to die, but I do
not want to be alone&mdash;even for an instant."</p>

<p>"You are not dead yet, Nalte." I couldn't think of anything
else to say. It must have sounded foolish at such a time, but
Nalte ignored it.</p>

<p>"You have been very good to me, Carson," she said.</p>

<p>"And you have been a regular brick, Nalte, if you know what
that means&mdash;which you don't."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Carson! It <i>is</i> the last second."</p>

<p>"I guess it is, Nalte." I stooped and kissed her. "Good-
by!"</p>

<p>From above us and behind us on the mound came a sudden
crackling hum that was like the noise that an X-ray machine
makes, but I knew that it was not an X-ray machine. I knew what
it was even without the evidence of the crumpling bodies of the
zangans dropping to the ground before us&mdash;it was the hum of
the r-ray rifle of Amtor!</p>

<p>I wheeled and looked up toward the summit of the mound. There
stood a dozen men pouring streams of the destructive rays upon
the pack. It lasted for but a few seconds, but not one of the
ferocious beasts escaped death. Then one of our rescuers (or were
they our captors) came toward us.</p>

<p>He, like his companions, was a man of almost perfect physique,
with a handsome, intelligent face. My first impression was that
if these were fair examples of the citizens of that white city
from which I assumed they had come, we must have stumbled upon an
Olympus inhabited solely by gods.</p>

<p>In every company of men we are accustomed to seeing some whose
proportions or features are ungainly or uncouth; but here, though
no two men exactly resembled one another, all were singularly
handsome and symmetrically proportioned.</p>

<p>He who approached us wore the customary gee-string and
military harness of the men of Amtor. His trappings were handsome
without being ornate, and I guessed from the insigne on the
fillet that encircled his brow that he was an officer.</p>

<p>"You had a close call," he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Rather too close for comfort," I replied. "We have you to
thank for our lives."</p>

<p>"I am glad that I arrived in time. I happened to be on the
river wall as you drifted past, and saw your encounter with the
men from Kormor. My interest was aroused; and, knowing that you
were headed for trouble down river on account of the falls, I
hurried down to try to warn you."</p>

<p>"A rather unusual interest in strangers for a man of Amtor," I
commented, "but I can assure you that I appreciate it even if I
do not understand it."</p>

<p>He laughed shortly. "It was the way you handled those three
creatures of Skor," he explained. "I saw possibilities in such a
man, and we are always looking for better qualities to infuse
into the blood of Havatoo. But come, let me introduce myself. I
am Ero Shan."</p>

<p>"And this is Nalte of Andoo," I replied, "and I am Carson
Napier of California."</p>

<p>"I have heard of Andoo," he acknowledged. "They raise an
exceptionally fine breed of people there, but I never heard of
your country. In fact I have never seen a man before with blue
eyes and yellow hair. Are all the people of Cal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"California," I prompted.</p>

<p>"&mdash;of California like you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! There are all colors among us, of hair and eyes and
skin."</p>

<p>"But how can you breed true to type, then?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"We don't," I had to admit.</p>

<p>"Rather shocking," he said, half to himself.
"Immoral&mdash;racially immoral. Well, be that as it may, your
system seems to have produced a rather fine type at that; and
now, if you will come with me, we shall return to Havatoo."</p>

<p>"May I ask," I inquired, "if we return as guests or as
prisoners?"</p>

<p>He smiled, just the shadow of a smile. "Will that make any
difference&mdash;as to whether you return with me or not?"</p>

<p>I glanced up at the armed men behind him and grinned. "None,"
I replied.</p>

<p>"Let us be friends," he said. "You will find justice in
Havatoo. If you deserve to remain as a guest, you will be treated
as a guest&mdash;if not&mdash;" he shrugged.</p>

<p><br>As we reached the top of the little hillock we saw, just
behind it, a long, low car with transverse seats and no top. It
was the first motor car that I had seen on Venus. The severity of
its streamlines and its lack of ornamentation suggested that it
was a military car.</p>

<p>As we entered the rear seat with Ero Shan his men took their
places in the forward seats. Ero Shan spoke a word of command and
the car moved forward. The driver was too far from me, and hidden
by the men between us, to permit me to see how he controlled the
car, which moved forward over the uneven ground smoothly and
swiftly.</p>

<p>Presently as we topped a rise of ground we saw the city of
Havatoo lying white and beautiful before us. From our elevation I
could see that it was built in the shape of a half circle with
the flat side lying along the water front, and it was entirely
walled.</p>

<p>The river curves to the right below the city, and the direct
route that we followed returning to it brought us to a gate
several miles from the river. The gate itself was of magnificent
proportions and an architectural gem, bespeaking a high order of
civilization and culture. The city wall, of white limestone, was
beautifully carved with scenes that I took to portray the history
of the city or of the race that inhabited it, the work having
apparently been conceived and executed with the rarest taste; and
these carvings extended as far as I could see.</p>

<p>When one considers the fact that the wall on the land side is
about eight miles long and on the river side about five miles,
and that all of it is elaborately carved, one may understand the
vast labor and the time required to complete such an undertaking
along both faces of a twenty foot wall.</p>

<p>As we were halted at the gate by the soldiers on guard I saw
emblazoned above the portal, in the characters of the universal
Amtorian language, "TAG KUM VOO KLAMBAD," Gate of the
Psychologists.</p>

<p>Beyond the gate we entered a broad, straight avenue that ran
directly toward the center of the water front. It was filled with
traffic&mdash;cars of various sizes and shapes, running swiftly
and quietly in both directions. There was nothing but vehicular
traffic on this level, pedestrians being accommodated on walkways
at the level of the second stories of the buildings, which were
connected by viaducts at all intersections.</p>

<p>There was practically no noise&mdash;no tooting of horns, no
screeching of brakes&mdash;traffic seemed to regulate itself. I
asked Ero Shan about it.</p>

<p>"It is very simple," he said. "All vehicles are energized from
a central power station from which power emanates in three
frequencies; on the control board of each vehicle is a dial that
permits the operator to pick up any frequency he desires. One is
for avenues running from the outer wall to the center of the
city, another is for transverse avenues, and the third for all
traffic outside the city. The first two are cut off and on
alternately; when one is on all traffic moving in the opposite
direction is stopped at intersections automatically."</p>

<p>"But why doesn't the traffic between intersections stop at the
same time?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That is regulated by the third frequency, which is always
operative," he explained. "A hundred feet before a vehicle
reaches an intersection a photo-electric current moves the dial
on the control board to the proper frequency for that lane."</p>

<p>Nalte was thrilled by all that she saw. She was a mountain
girl from a small kingdom, and this was the first large city that
she had ever seen.</p>

<p>"It is marvelous," she said. "And how beautiful the people
are!"</p>

<p>I had noticed that fact myself. Both the men and the women in
the cars that passed us were of extraordinary perfection of form
and feature.</p>

<p>Ambad Lat, Psychologist Avenue, led us directly to a
semicircular civic center at the water front, from which the
principal avenues radiated toward the outer wall like the spokes
of a wheel from the hub toward the felloe.</p>

<p><br>Here were magnificent buildings set in a gorgeous park,
and here Ero Shan escorted us from the car toward a splendid
palace. There were many people in the park, going to or coming
from the various buildings. There was no hurry, no bustle, no
confusion; nor was there idling or loitering. All suggested well
considered, unhurried efficiency. The voices of those who
conversed were pleasant, well modulated. Like the people I had
seen elsewhere in the city, these were all handsome and well
formed.</p>

<p>We followed Ero Shan through an entrance into a wide corridor.
Many of those we passed spoke pleasant greetings to our
companion, and all of them looked at us with seemingly friendly
interest, but without rudeness.</p>

<p>"Beautiful people in a beautiful city," murmured Nalte.</p>

<p>Ero Shan turned toward her with a quick smile. "I am glad that
you like us and Havatoo," he said. "I hope that nothing will ever
alter this first impression."</p>

<p>"You think that something may?" asked Nalte.</p>

<p>Ero Shan shrugged. "That all depends upon you," he replied,
"or rather upon your ancestors."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Nalte.</p>

<p>"You will presently."</p>

<p>He stopped before a door and, swinging it open, bade us enter.
We were in a small anteroom in which several clerks were
employed.</p>

<p>"Please inform Korgan Kantum Mohar that I wish to see him,"
said Ero Shan to one of the clerks.</p>

<p>The man pressed one of several buttons on his desk and said,
"Korgan Sentar Ero Shan wishes to see you."</p>

<p>Apparently from the desk top a deep voice replied, "Send him
in."</p>

<p>"Come with me," directed Ero Shan, and we crossed the anteroom
to another door which a clerk opened. In the room beyond a man
faced us from a desk behind which he was seated. He looked up at
us with the same friendly interest that had been manifested by
the people we had passed in the park and the corridor.</p>

<p>As we were introduced to Korgan Kantum Mohar he arose and
acknowledged the introduction with a bow; then he invited us to
be seated.</p>

<p>"You are strangers in Havatoo," he remarked. "It is not often
that strangers enter our gates." He turned to Ero Shan. "Tell me,
how did it happen?"</p>

<p>Ero Shan told of witnessing my encounter with the three men
from Kormor. "I hated to see a man like this go over the falls,"
he continued, "and I felt that it was worth while bringing them
into Havatoo for an examination. Therefore I have brought them
directly to you, hoping that you will agree with me."</p>

<p>"It can do no harm," admitted Mohar. "The examining board is
in session now. Take them over. I will advise the board that I
have authorized the examination."</p>

<p>"What is the examination, and what is its purpose?" I asked.
"Perhaps we do not care to take it."</p>

<p>Korgan Kantum Mohar smiled. "It is not for you to say," he
said.</p>

<p>"You mean that we are prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Let us say rather guests by command."</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me the purpose of this examination?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all. It is to determine whether or not you shall be
permitted to live."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12">XII. &mdash; HAVATOO</a></h2>

<p class="first">They were all very polite and pleasant, very
professional and efficient. First we were bathed; then blood
tests were made, our hearts examined, our blood pressure taken,
our reflexes checked. After that we were ushered into a large
room where five men sat behind a long table.</p>

<p>Ero Shan accompanied us throughout the examination. Like the
others, he was always pleasant and friendly. He encouraged us to
hope that we would pass the examination successfully. Even yet I
did not understand what it was all about. I asked Ero Shan.</p>

<p>"Your companion remarked upon the beauty of Havatoo and its
people," he replied. "This examination is the explanation of that
beauty&mdash;and of many other things here which you do not yet
know of."</p>

<p>The five men seated behind the long table were quite as
pleasant as any of the others we had met. They questioned us
rapidly for fully an hour and then dismissed us. From the
questions propounded I judged that one of them was a biologist,
another a psychologist, one a chemist, the fourth a physicist,
and the fifth a soldier.</p>

<p>"Korgan Sentar Ero Shan," said he who appeared to be the head
of the examining board, "you will take custody of the man until
the result of the examination is announced. Hara Es will take
charge of the girl." He indicated a woman who had entered the
room with us and had been standing beside Nalte.</p>

<p>The latter pressed closer to me. "Oh, Carson! They are going
to separate us," she whispered.</p>

<p>I turned toward Ero Shan to expostulate, but he motioned me to
be silent. "You will have to obey," he said, "but I think you
have no reason to worry."</p>

<p>Then Nalte was led away by Hara Es, and Ero Shan took me with
him. A car was waiting for Ero Shan, and in it we were driven
into a district of beautiful homes. Presently the car drew up in
front of one of these and stopped.</p>

<p>"This is my home," said my companion. "You will be my guest
here until the result of the examination is announced. I wish you
to enjoy yourself while you are with me. Do not worry; it will do
no good. Nalte is safe. She will be well cared for."</p>

<p>"At least they have provided me with a beautiful prison and a
pleasant jailer," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Please do not think of yourself as a prisoner," begged Ero
Shan. "It will make us both unhappy, and unhappiness is not to be
tolerated in Havatoo."</p>

<p>"I am far from unhappy," I assured him. "On the contrary, I am
greatly enjoying the experience, but I still cannot understand
what crime is charged against Nalte and me that we should have
been put on trial for our lives."</p>

<p>"It was not you who were on trial; it was your heredity," he
explained.</p>

<p>"An explanation," I assured him, "that leaves me as much at
sea as I was before."</p>

<p><br>We had entered the house as we were conversing, and I
found myself amid as lovely surroundings as I have ever seen.
Good taste and good judgment had evidently dictated, not only the
design of the house, but its appointments as well. From the
entrance there was a vista of shrubbery and flowers and trees in
a beautiful garden at the end of a wide hall. It was to this
garden that Ero Shan led me and then to an apartment that opened
upon it.</p>

<p>"You will find everything here for your convenience and
comfort," he said. "I shall detail a man to wait upon you; he
will be courteous and efficient. But he will also be responsible
for your presence when it is again required at the Central
Laboratories.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, seating himself in a chair near a window,
"let me try to answer your last question more explicitly.</p>

<p>"Havatoo and the race that inhabits it are the result of
generations of scientific culture. Originally we were a people
ruled by hereditary jongs that various factions sought to
dominate for their own enrichment and without consideration for
the welfare of the remainder of the people.</p>

<p>"If we had a good jong who was also a strong character we were
well ruled; otherwise the politicians misruled us. These
politicians were opportunists, demagogues, or worse. For the most
part they were men without culture or great intelligence, for the
better classes would not enter politics where they were forced to
mingle with men of this stamp. Half of our people lived in direst
poverty, in vice, in filth; and they bred like flies. The better
classes, refusing to bring children into such a world, dwindled
rapidly. Ignorance and mediocrity ruled.</p>

<p>"Then a great jong came to the throne. He abrogated all
existing laws and government and vested both in himself. Two
titles have been conferred upon him&mdash;one while he lived, the
other after his death. The first was Mankar the Bloody; the
second, Mankar the Savior.</p>

<p>"He was a great warrior, and he had the warrior class behind
him. With what seemed utter ruthlessness he wiped out the
politicians, and to the positions many of them had filled he
appointed the greatest minds of Havatoo&mdash;physicists,
biologists, chemists, and psychologists.</p>

<p>"He encouraged the raising of children by people whom these
scientists passed as fit to raise children, and he forbade all
others to bear children. He saw to it that the physically,
morally, or mentally defective were rendered incapable of
bringing their like into the world; and no defective infant was
allowed to live.</p>

<p>"Then, before his death, he created a new form of
government&mdash;a government without laws and without a king. He
abdicated his throne and relinquished the destinies of Havatoo to
a quintumvirate that but guides and judges.</p>

<p>"Of these five men one is a sentar (biologist), one an ambad
(psychologist), one a kalto (chemist), one a kantum (physicist),
and one a korgan (soldier). This quintumvirate is called Sanjong
(literally, five-king), and the fitness of its members to serve
is determined by examinations similar to that which was given
you. These examinations are held every two years. Any citizen may
take them; any citizen may become one of the Sanjong. It is the
highest honor to which a citizen of Havatoo may win, and he may
only achieve it through actual merit. His qualifications are not
left to the guesswork of an electorate influenced by the heat and
passion and misrepresentations of a political campaign, or to an
accident of birth that made one man a slave and another a
king."</p>

<p>"And these men make the laws and administer justice," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"There are no laws in Havatoo," he replied. "During the many
generations since Mankar we have bred a race of rational people
who know the difference between right and wrong, and for such no
rules of behavior are necessary. The Sanjong merely guides."</p>

<p>"Do you have any difficulty in finding the proper men to form
the Sanjong?" I asked.</p>

<p>"None whatever. There are thousands of men in Havatoo capable
of serving with honor and distinction. There is a tendency to
breed Sanjongs among five of the six classes into which the
people of Havatoo are naturally divided.</p>

<p>"When you become more familiar with the city you will discover
that the semicircular area facing the Central Laboratories is
divided into five sections. The section next to the river and
above the Central Laboratories is called Kantum. Here reside the
physicists. There are no caste distinctions between the
physicists and any of the other five classes, but because they
all live in the same district and because their interests are
alike there is a greater tendency for them to associate with one
another than with members of other classes. The result is that
they more often mate with their own kind&mdash;the laws of
heredity do the rest, and the breed of physicists in Havatoo is
constantly improving, with the result that we constantly find a
better physicist winning a place on the Sanjon as the years go
by.</p>

<p>"The next district is Kalto; here live the chemists. The
center district is Korgan, the district in which I dwell. It is
reserved for the warrior class. Next comes Ambad, the section
where the psychologists live; and, last, Sentar, for the
biologists, lies along the water front and down the river from
the Central Laboratories.</p>

<p>"Havatoo is laid out like the half of a wagon wheel, with the
Central Laboratories at the hub. The main sections of the city
are bounded by four concentric semicircles. Inside the first is
the civic center, where the Central Laboratories are situated;
this I have called the hub. Between this and the next semicircle
lie the five sub districts I have just described. Between this
and the third semicircle lies the largest district, called
Yorgan; here dwell the common people. And in the fourth section,
a narrow strip just inside the outer wall, are the shops,
markets, and factories."</p>

<p>"It is all most interesting," I said, "and to me the most
interesting part of it is that the city is governed without
laws."</p>

<p>"Without man-made laws," Ero Shan corrected me. "We are
governed by natural laws with which all intelligent people are
conversant; by applying eugenics intelligently we have eliminated
the unintelligent. Of course occasionally a citizen commits an
act that is harmful to another or to the peace of the city, for
the genes of vicious and nonconformist characteristics have not
all been eradicated from the germ cells of all of the citizens of
Havatoo.</p>

<p>"If one commits an act that is subversive of the rights of
others or of the general welfare of the community he is tried by
a court that is not hampered by technicalities nor precedent and
which, taking into consideration all of the facts in the case,
including the heredity of the defendant, reaches a decision that
is final and without appeal. The result of the act itself in
never considered; our courts seek causes only.

"There is no punishment in the sense that it was formerly
understood. The sole aim of the courts is to prevent a repetition
of unsocial acts by this and future generations. If it is a first
offense in four generations of the defendant's family, it is
merely recorded against his blood line. For the second offense of
a minor nature he is placed under observation. For more serious
infractions or for a repetition of minor ones he is rendered
incapable of perpetuating his type; and, as a rule, for any
fourth offense he is destroyed."</p>

<p>"It seems rather drastic to punish a man for the acts of his
ancestors," I remarked.</p>

<p>"But let me remind you that we do not punish," explained Ero
Shan. "We only seek to improve the race to the end that we shall
attain the greatest measure of happiness and contentment.
Nonconformists are not good material with which to improve a race
nor are people who make too many mistakes."</p>

<p>"Havatoo, with no bad people in it, must be an ideal city in
which to live," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, there are some bad people," replied Ero Shan, "for there
are bad genes in all of us; but we are a very intelligent race,
and the more intelligent people are the better able are they to
control their bad impulses. Occasionally strangers enter Havatoo,
bad men from the city across the river. How they accomplish it is
a mystery that has never been solved, but we know that they come
and steal a man or a woman occasionally. Sometimes we catch them,
and when we do we destroy them. Rarely, our own people commit
crimes, usually crimes of passion; but occasionally one commits a
premeditated crime. The latter are a menace to the race and are
not permitted to survive and transmit their characteristics to
future generations or influence the present by their bad
examples."</p>

<p><br>As he ceased speaking a very powerfully built man came to
the door of the room. "You sent for me, Korgan Sentar Ero Shan?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Come in, Herlak," said Ero Shan. Then he turned to me.
"Herlak will serve and guard you until the result of the
examination is announced. You will find him an efficient and
pleasant companion.</p>

<p>"Herlak," he continued, addressing my guard, "this man is a
stranger in Havatoo. He has just been before the examining board.
You will be responsible for him until the board's decision has
been announced. His name is Carson Napier."</p>

<p>The man inclined his head. "I understand," he said.</p>

<p>"You will both dine with me in an hour," Ero Shan announced as
he took his departure.</p>

<p>"If you would like to rest before dinner," said Herlak, "there
is a couch in the next room."</p>

<p>I went in and lay down, and Herlak came and sat in a chair in
the same room. It was evident that he was not going to let me get
out of his sight. I was tired, but not sleepy; so I started a
conversation with Herlak.</p>

<p>"Are you employed in Ero Shan's house?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am a soldier in the unit he commands," he explained.</p>

<p>"An officer?"</p>

<p>"No, a common soldier."</p>

<p>"But he asked you to dine with him. In my world officers do
not mingle socially with common soldiers."</p>

<p>Herlak laughed. "Similar social conditions prevailed in
Havatoo ages ago," he said, "but not now. There are no social
distinctions. We are all far too intelligent, too cultured, and
too sure of ourselves to need artificial conventions to determine
our importance. Whether a man cleans a street or is a member of
the Sanjong is not so important as is how he performs the duties
of his position, his civic morality, and his culture.</p>

<p>"In a city where all are intelligent and cultured all men must
be more or less companionable, and an officer suffers no loss of
authority by mingling with his men socially."</p>

<p>"But don't the soldiers take advantage of this familiarity to
impose upon their officers?" I asked.</p>

<p>Herlak looked his surprise. "Why should they?" he demanded.
"They know their duties as well as the officer knows his; and it
is the aim in life of every good citizen to do his duty, not to
evade it."</p>

<p>I shook my head as I thought of the mess that Earth-men have
made of government and civilization by neglecting to apply to the
human race the simple rules which they observe to improve the
breeds of dogs and cows and swine.</p>

<p>"Do the various classes mingle to the extent of
intermarrying?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Herlak. "It is thus that we maintain the
high moral and mental standards of the people. Were it otherwise,
the yorgans must deteriorate while the several other classes
diverged so greatly from one another that eventually they would
have nothing in common and no basis for mutual understanding and
regard. Then must come misunderstanding, dissension, strife, and the certain destruction of the race."</p>

<p>I could not but think of these very conditions on earth that
had been brought about by ages of inequality of breeding, and
pray that there might arise in my own world a Mankar the
Bloody.</p>

<p>We talked of many things during that hour while we
awaited dinner, and this common soldier of Havatoo discussed the
sciences and the arts with far greater understanding and
appreciation than I myself possessed. I asked him if he was
particularly well educated, and he said that he was
not&mdash;that all the men and women of Havatoo were schooled
alike to a certain point, when a series of elaborate examinations
determined the calling for which they were best fitted and in
which they would find the greatest happiness.</p>

<p>"But where do you find your street cleaners?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You speak as though some reproach might attach to that
calling," he remonstrated.</p>

<p>"But it is work that many might find distasteful," I
argued.</p>

<p>"Necessary and useful work is never distasteful to the man
best fitted to do it. Of course, highly intelligent people prefer
creative work, and so these necessary but more or less mechanical
duties, which, by the way, are usually done by means of
mechanical contrivances in Havatoo, never become the permanent
calling of any man. Any one can do them; so every one takes his
turn&mdash;that is, every one in the yorgan class. It is his
contribution to the public welfare&mdash;a tax paid in useful
labor."</p>

<p>And now a girl came to summon us to dinner. She was a very
lovely girl; her saronglike garment was of fine material, her
ornaments of great beauty.</p>

<p>"A member of Ero Shan's family?" I asked Herlak after she had
left.</p>

<p>"She is employed in his house," replied Herlak. "Korgan Sentar
Ero Shan has no family."</p>

<p>I had heard this Korgan Sentar title attached to Ero Shan's
name previously, and had wondered relative to its significance.
The two words mean warrior biologist, but they made no sense to
me as a title. I questioned Herlak concerning them as we crossed
the garden in response to the summons to dinner.</p>

<p>"The title means that he is both a warrior and a biologist; he
has passed examinations admitting him to both classes. The fact
that he is a member of one of the other four classes as well as a
Korgan makes him an officer and eligible to the title. We common
soldiers would not care to serve under any but a brilliant man;
and believe me it takes a brilliant man to pass the entrance
examination to any of the scientific classes, for he has to pass
creditably even in the three to which he is not seeking
elevation."</p>

<p>Herlak led me to a large apartment where I saw Ero Shan, three
other men, and six women laughing and talking together. There was
a suggestion of a lull in the conversation as we entered the
room, and interested glances were cast in my direction. Ero Shan
came forward to meet me and then introduced me to his other
guests, who greeted me pleasantly.</p>

<p>As I recall them, they were Ambad Agon, Kalto Bo Gasto, and
Yorgan Danar, the three men; the women were Luan, Gara Lo, Hambi
Kan, Oroso, Kabell, and Joran. The men were handsome, the women
beautiful; and all were intelligent and cultured, although
several were of the yorgan class.</p>

<p>At dinner I was seated between Luan and Gara Lo, both of whom
were extremely gracious. Never before in my life had I been
present at such a brilliant gathering. The scintillant wit, the
easy flowing conversation seemed as natural and effortless as
breathing. There was no straining for effect, no labored jokes;
and oftentimes there were silences. No one seemed to feel that it
was necessary to speak unless there was something to say, and the
silences were never strained nor embarrassing.</p>

<p>Luan asked me about the country from which I came, and when I
told her that I was from another world, she asked me to explain
how there could be another world and where.</p>

<p>Very briefly I explained what our astronomers had learned of
the solar system. The distances staggered her.</p>

<p>"Twenty-six million miles!" she exclaimed, when I told her of
the distance that separated Amtor from my own Earth.</p>

<p>Then I told her about the stars, the other suns far out in
space, and that the nearest one was 255 million million miles
away. By this time every one at the table was listening.</p>

<p>"Our scientists have long known," said Luan, "that the old
theory that Amtor is a disc floating on a sea of molten rock is
wrong; they have been feeling vaguely toward something such as
you decribe. Your scientidts must be very brilliant to have
arrived at such a theory and then, as you have told me, proved it
beyound question."</p>

<p>"They have a great advantage over your scientists in such
matters," I explained. "They can see the other planets and the
stars by night and the sun by day; their world is not perpetually
surrounded by clouds, as is Amtor."</p>

<p>"Did you tell the examining board these thing today?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"They did not ask me," I replied.</p>

<p>"They must not destroy you!" she exclaimed. "Perhaps you hold
the key to many secrets for which they have been searching
through the ages."</p>

<p>"You think they may destroy me?" I asked.</p>

<p>How may I know what even the examining board may not know as
yet?" </p>

<h2><a id="ch13">XIII. &mdash; A PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY</a></h2>

<p class="first">DESPITE the fact that my fate hung in the
balance I slept soundly that night. Herlak slept on a couch near
me that night. I called him the death watch, and he was polite
enough to seem to enjoy my little joke.</p>

<p>Ero Shan, Herlak and I breakfasted together the next morning.
The girl who had summoned us to dinner the night before waited on
us. She was so radiantly beautiful that it was almost
embarrassing; I felt that I should be waiting on her. She was
young, but then every one I had seen in Havatoo appeared
young.</p>

<p>Of course I was not greatly surprised by this, for I knew of
the longevity serum developed by the scientists of Amtor. I
myself had been inoculated against old age, but I remarked on it
casually to Ero Shan.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "we could live forever if the Sanjong so
decreed. At least we would never die of old age or disease, but
they have decreed otherwise. Our serum gives immunity for two or
three hundred years, depending upon the natural constitution of
the individual. When it ceases to be effective death comes
quickly. As a rule we anticipate it when we see that the end is
coming."</p>

<p>"But why not live forever if you can?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It was quite apparent that if we lived forever the number of
children that could be permitted would be too small to result in
any considerable improvement of the race, and so we have refused
immortality in the interest of future generations and of all
Amtor."</p>

<p>As we were finishing breakfast word was brought to Ero Shan
directing him to bring me before the examining board immediately;
and a short time later, with Herlak accompanying us, we entered
Ero Shan's car and drove down the Korgan Lat, or Avenue of
Warriors, toward the Central Laboratories that stand in the civic
center of Havatoo.</p>

<p>Both Ero Shan and Herlak were unusually quiet and grave during
the drive, and I sensed that they anticipated that the worst was
about to befall me. Nor can I say that I was particularly blithe
though the least of my worries was occasioned by what lay in
store for me; it was Duare I was thinking of, Duare and
Nalte.</p>

<p>The stately government buildings, the Sera Tartum or Central
Laboratories as they call them, looked very beautiful in the
gorgeous setting of Mankar Pol, the park that is named for the
great last jong of Havatoo, as we drove in and stopped before the
building in which I had been examined the day before.</p>

<p>The naming of these building laboratories explains tersely
their psychology of government. They have made a science of the
business of governing; but research and experimentation continue,
and scientists carry on such work in labratories. I like the
idea, and I recommend it to earth men; not merely the name but
the application of science to the betterment of the humman race
and the conditions under which it lives.</p>

<p>We did not have to wait after we entered the building, but
were immediately ushered into the presence of the examining
board. Their grave faces portended bad news, and I prepared
myself for the worst. Through my mind raced plans for escape, but
something told me that these people did things so well and were
so efficient that there would be no escape from whatever fate
they decreed for me.</p>

<p>Kantum Shogan, chief of the board, invited me to be seated;
and I took a chair facing the august five. Ero Shan sat at my
right, Herlak at my left.</p>

<p>"Carson Napier," commenced Kantum Shogan, "our examination of
you shows that you are not without merit. Physically you approach
that perfection toward which our race is constantly striving;
intellectually you are alert but ill trained&mdash;you have no
culture. While that might be remedied, I regret to advise you
that you possess inherent psychological faults that, if
transmitted to progeny or allowed to contaminate others through
association with you, would work inestimable wrong on future
generations.</p>

<p>"You are the unfortunate victim of inherited repressions,
complexes, and fears. To a great extent you have risen above
these destructive characteristics but the chromosomes of your
germ cells are replete with these vicious genes, constituting a
potential menace to generations yet unborn.</p>

<p>"With deep regret, therefore, we could but conclude that it
would best serve the interests of humanity were you
destroyed."</p>

<p>"May I ask," I inquired, "by what right you elect to say
whether or not I shall live? I am not a citizen of Havatoo. I did
not come to Havatoo of my own free will. If&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kantum Shogan raised his hand in a gesture that enjoined
silence. "I repeat," he said, "that we regret the necessity, but
there is nothing more to be said upon the subject. Your
accomplishments are not such as to outweigh your inherited
defects. This is unfortunate, but of course Havatoo cannot be
expected to suffer because of it."</p>

<p><br>So I was to die! After all that I had passed through it
verged upon the ridiculous that I should die thus tamely simply
because one of my ancestors failed to exercise a little
intelligence in the selection of his bride. And to come all this
long way just to die! It made me smile.</p>

<p>"Why do you smile?" inquired a member of the board. "Does
death seem an amusing thing to you? Or do you smile because you
expect to escape death through some ruse?"</p>

<p>"I smile," I replied, "when perhaps I should weep&mdash;weep
at the thought of all the toil and knowledge and energy that were
wasted to transport me twenty-six million miles just to die
because five men of another world believe that I have inherited
some bad genes."</p>

<p>"Twenty-six million miles!" exclaimed a member of the board;
and a second:</p>

<p>"Another world! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I came here from another world twenty-six million
miles from Amtor," I replied. "A world much further advanced in
some respects than yours."</p>

<p>Every member of the board evinced keen interest in my
statement. I heard one of them remark to another, "This bears out
the theory that many of us have long held." "Most interesting,
and not improbable," said another. "I should like to here
more."</p>

<p>"You say that Amtor is not the only world?" demanded Kantum
Shogan; "that there is another?"</p>

<p>"The heavens are filled with countless worlds," I replied.
"Your world and mine and at least eight other worlds revolve
around a great ball of flaming gases that we call a sun, and this
sun with its worlds or planets is called a solar system. The
illimitable void of the heavens is starred with countless other
suns, many of which are the centers of other solar systems; and
no man knows how many worlds there are."</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Kantum Shogan. "You have said enough to suggest
that our examination of you may have been faulty in that it
presumed that we possessed the sum total of available human
knowledge. Now it appears that you may possess knowledge of such
vast importance as to outweigh the biological inadequacies
inherent in you.</p>

<p>"We shall question you further upon the subject of this theory
which you have propounded, and in the meantime the execution of
our sentence is postponed. Our final decision as to your future
will depend upon the outcome of this further questioning. Science
may ignore no possible source of knowledge, and if your theory is
sound and opens a new field to science, you shall be free to
enjoy Havatoo for life; nor shall you go unhonored."</p>

<p>Although I had graduated with honors from a college of high
scholastic standing I realized as I stood in the presence of
these super-men of science that what Kantum Shogan had said of me
was true. By comparison with them I was poorly trained and
uncultured&mdash;my degrees meaningless, my diploma a mere scrap
of paper. Yet in one field of science I surpassed them, and as I
explained the solar system and drew diagrams of it for them I saw
the keen interest and the ready understanding with which they
grasped all I said.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, they were listening to an explanation
of the phenomena of the transition from day to night and from
night to day, of the seasons, of the tides. Their vision
restricted by the cloud envelopes that constantly enshroud Venus,
they had been able to see nothing upon which to base a planetary
theory; and so it is not strange that astronomy was an unknown
science to them, that the sun and the stars did not exist insofar
as they were concerned.</p>

<p><br>For four hours they listened to me and questioned me;
then they instructed Ero Shan and Herlak to withdraw to an
anteroom with me and wait there until we were again summoned.</p>

<p>We did not have long to wait. In less than fifteen minutes we
were recalled before the board.</p>

<p>"It is our unanimous opinion," announced Kantum Shogan, "that
your value to humanity far outweighs the danger that it incurs
from your inherited defects. You are to live and enjoy the
freedom of Havatoo. Your duties will consist of instructing
others in that new science which you call astronomy and in
applying it for the welfare of humanity.</p>

<p>"As you are now the only member of your class you may live in
any section of the city you choose. Your requisitions for all
that you require for your personal needs and the advancement of
your department will be honored by the Sera Tartum.</p>

<p>"For the time being I recommend you to the guidance of Korgan
Sentar Ero Shan as you are a stranger to Havatoo and will wish to
become familiar with our customs and our manners." With that he dismissed us.</p>

<p>"Before I go may I ask what is to become of the girl, Nalte,
who was taken with me yesterday?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"She was considered fit to remain in the yorgan section of
Havatoo," he replied. "When her duties have been definitely
determined and her living quarters assigned her I will let you
know where you may find her."</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of relief that I left the Sera Tartum
with Ero Shan and Herlak. Nalte was safe, and so was I. Now if I
could only find Duare!</p>

<p>I spent the following several days familiarizing myself with
the city and purchasing such things as I required, all of which
were suggested by Ero Shan. Among them was a car. It was very
easy&mdash;all I had to do was sign a voucher.</p>

<p>"But what check have they on my expenditures?" I asked my
friend. "I do not even know how much has been placed to my
credit."</p>

<p>"Why should they check what you spend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"But I might be dishonest. I might buy things for which I had
no need and resell them," I suggested.</p>

<p>Ero Shan laughed. "They know you will not do that," he assured
me. "If the psychologist who examined you had not known that you
are an honorable man, not even your knowledge of astronomy would
have saved you; that is one vice we will not tolerate in Havatoo.
When Mankar destroyed the corrupt and the vicious he almost
completely eradicated the breeds in Havatoo, and during the many
generations of men that have followed him we have succeeded in
completing the work he inaugurated. There are no dishonest men in
Havatoo."</p>

<p><br>I often talked with Ero Shan about Duare. I wanted to
cross the river to Kormor and search for her, but he convinced me
that it would be suicidal to attempt it. And in view of the fact
that I had no reason to believe that she was there I reluctantly
put the idea away from me.</p>

<p>"If I had an aeroplane," I said, "I would find a way to search
Kormor."</p>

<p>"What is an airplane?" asked Ero Shan, and when I explained it
he became very much interested, as flying has never been
developed in Amtor, at least in those portions with which I am
familiar.</p>

<p>The idea intrigued my companion to such an extent that he
could scarcely talk of anything else. I explained the various
types of both heavier and lighter than air ships and described
the rocket in which I had traversed space from Earth to Venus. In
the evening he had me sketch the several types I had explained.
His interest seemed to be becoming an obsession.</p>

<p><br>One evening when I returned to the house I now shared with Ero
Shan I found a message awaiting me. It was from an under-clerk of
the board of examiners and it gave the address of the house in
which Nalte lived.</p>

<p>As I was now familiar with the city I started out in my car
after the evening meal to visit Nalte. I went alone as Ero Shan
had another engagement. I think that it was with Gara Lo, one of
the girls I had met at his dinner the evening of the day that I
had been brought to Havatoo.</p>

<p>I found the house in which Nalte lived in the yorgan section
on a quiet street not far from the Korgan Lat, the Avenue of
Warriors. The house was occupied by women who cleaned the
preparatory schools on the Korgan Lat nearby. One of their number
admitted me and said that she would call Nalte; then she
conducted me to a living room in which were eight or ten women.
One of them was playing a musical instrument, the others were
painting, embroidering, or reading.</p>

<p>As I entered, they stopped what they were doing and greeted me
pleasantly. There was not one among them that was not beautiful,
and all were intelligent and cultured. These were the scrub women
of Havatoo! Breeding had done for the people of Havatoo what it
has done for our prize-winning dairy herds; it has advanced them
all toward perfection.</p>

<p>Nalte was glad to see me, and as I wished to visit with her
alone I asked her to come for a ride with me.</p>

<p>"I am glad that you passed your examination successfully," I
said as we started toward the Korgan Lat.</p>

<p>Nalte laughed joyously. "I just squeezed through," she
admitted. "I wonder what they would say back in Andoo if they
knew that I, the daughter of their jong, was considered fit only
to scrub floors in Havatoo!" and again she laughed happily. It
was plain to be seen that her pride had not suffered by reason of
her assignment. "But after all," she continued, "it is a high
honor to be considered fit to remain on any footing among such a
race of supermen.</p>

<p>"And you! I am very proud of you, Carson Napier, for I have
been told that you were elevated to a high place among them."</p>

<p>It was my turn to laugh now. "I did not pass the examination
at all," I admitted. "I would have been destroyed but for my
knowledge of a science that is unknown to Amtor. It was rather a
jolt to my self esteem."</p>

<p>We drove along the Korgan Lat, through the great public park
and parade ground in the center of which stands a magnificent
stadium, and thus to the Avenue of the Gates which forms a great
arc nearly eight miles long just inside the outer wall on the
land side of Havatoo.</p>

<p>Here are the factories and the shops in the district included
between the Avenue of Gates and the Yorgan Lat, a wide avenue a
third of a mile inside the wall, all the principal shops being
located along the Avenue of Gates. The avenue and the shops were
brilliantly lighted, the street swarmed with vehicles, and the
walkways at the level of the second stories were crowded with
pedestrians.</p>

<p>We drove twice the full length of the avenue, enjoying the
life and beauty of the scene; then we drove into one of the
parking places, to which all of the ground floors on the main
arteries are devoted, and were lifted by an escalator to the
walkway on the level above.</p>

<p>Here shops displayed their wares in show windows, much as is
the custom in American cities, though many of the displays aimed
solely to please the eye rather than to call attention to the
goods for sale within.</p>

<p>The scientists of Havatoo have developed a light that is
brilliant and at the same time soft with which they attain
effects impossible of achievement by our relatively crude
lighting methods. At no place is the source of the light
apparent; it casts soft shadows and gives forth no heat.
Ordinarily it resembles sunlight, but it can also produce soft,
pastel shades of various hues.</p>

<p>After we had enjoyed the spectacle for an hour, mingling with
the happy crowd upon the walkway, I made a few small purchases,
including a gift for Nalte; then we returned to my car, and I
took my companion home.</p>

<p><br>The next morning I was busy organizing my classes in
astronomy, and so numerous were those wishing to enroll that I
had to organize several large classes, and as only four hours a
day are ordinarily devoted to work of any nature it was evident
that I should have to devote my time at first to the training of
instructors if the new science was to be expounded to all the
inhabitants who were interested.</p>

<p>I was greatly flattered by the personnel of the first
matriculants. Not only were there scientists and soldiers from
the first five classes of Havatoo, but every member of the
Sanjong, the ruling quintumvirate of Havatoo, enrolled. The
thirst of these people for useful knowledge is insatiable.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon, my work for the day having been completed,
I received a summons to call upon Korgan Kantum Mohar, the
warrior physicist who had arranged for the examination of Nalte
and myself the day Ero Shan brought us to the city.</p>

<p>I could not but wonder what he wanted of me. Could it be that
I must undergo another examination? Always, I presume, I shall
connect Mohar's name with examinations.</p>

<p>As I entered his office on the Sera Tartum he greeted me with
the same pleasant demeanor that had marked his attitude the day
he had told me I was to be examined to ascertain whether or not I
should be permitted to live; so his graciousness was not entirely
reassuring.</p>

<p>"Come over here and sit down near me," he said. "I have
something here that I should like to discuss with you."</p>

<p>As I took a chair beside him I saw spread on his desk the
sketches of airships that I had made for Ero Shan.</p>

<p>"These," he said, pointing to the sketches, "were brought to
me by Ero Shan who explained them as best he could. He was quite
excited and enthusiastic about them, and I must confess that he
imparted some of his enthusiasm to me. I am much interested, and
would know more concerning these ships that sail through the
air."</p>

<p>For an hour I talked to him and answered his questions. I
dwelt principally on the practical achievements of
aëronautics&mdash;the long flights, the great speed, the uses to
which ships had been put in times of peace and in times of
war.</p>

<p>Korgan Kantum Mohar was deeply interested. The questions that
he asked revealed the trained, scientific mind; and the last one
that of the soldier, the man of action.</p>

<p>"Can you build one of these ships for me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I told him that I could but that it might require long
experimentation to adapt their motors and materials to the
requirements of a successful airplane.</p>

<p>"You have two or three hundred years," he said with a smile,
"and the resources of a race of scientists. Materials that we do
not now possess we can produce; nothing is impossible to
science."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14">XIV. &mdash; ATTACK IN THE NIGHT</a></h2>

<p class="first">I was given a factory close to the Gate of the
Physicists, at the end of Kantum Lat. I chose this location
because there was a level plain beyond this gate that would make
an excellent flying field, and also so that I would have my
finished plane finally assembled where it could easily be wheeled
out of the city without interfering with traffic to any great
extent.</p>

<p>On the advice of the Sanjong, which took a deep interest in
both this new venture into aëronautics and the, to them, new
science of astronomy, I divided my time between the two.</p>

<p>My time was fully occupied, and I worked far more than the
usual four hours a day. But I enjoyed the work, especially the
building of a plane; and engrossing were the day dreams in which
I indulged of exploring Venus in a ship of my own.</p>

<p>The necessity for relaxation and entertainment is stressed by
the people of Havatoo, and Ero Shan was constantly dragging me
away from my drawing board or my conferences with the corps of
assistants that had been placed at my disposal by Mohar to take
me to this thing or that.</p>

<p>There were theaters, art exhibits, lectures, musicales,
concerts, and games of various descriptions in gymnasiums and the
great stadium. Many of their games are extremely dangerous, and
injury and death often accompany them. In the great stadium at
least once a month men fight with wild beasts or with one another
to the death, and once a year the great war game is played. Ero
Shan, Gara Lo, Ero Shan's friend, Nalte, and I attended this
year's game together. To Nalte and I it was all new; we did not
know what to expect.</p>

<p>"Probably we shall witness an exhibition of such scientific
wonders as only the men of Havatoo are capable," I suggested to
her.</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest conception of what it will be," she
replied. "No one will tell me anything about it. They say, 'Wait
and see. You will be thrilled as you have never been
before.'"</p>

<p>"The game doubtless hinges on the use of the most modern,
scientific instruments of war and strategy," I ventured.</p>

<p>"Well," she remarked, "we shall soon know. It is about time
for the games to commence."</p>

<p>The great stadium, seating two hundred thousand people, was
crammed to capacity. It was gorgeous with the costumes and the
jewels of the women and the handsome trappings of the men, for
the intelligence of Havatoo concedes their full value to beauty
and to art. But of all that went to make up this splendid
spectacle there was nothing more outstanding than the divine
beauty of the people themselves.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry arose, a roar of welcome. "They come!
They come! The warriors come!"</p>

<p><br>Onto the field at each end marched two hundred men; a
hundred men naked but for white gee-strings at one end of the
field, a hundred men with red gee-strings at the other end of the
field. They carried short swords and shields. For a while they
stood inactive, waiting; then two small cars were driven onto the
field. Each contained a driver and a young woman; that is, they
looked young. Of course they might have been anywhere from
eighteen to three hundred years old, for the people of Havatoo do
not age after maturity; I mean they do not age in appearance.</p>

<p>One of the cars was red, the other white. The red car attached
itself to the contingent wearing the red gee-strings, the white
car to the whites.</p>

<p>When they were in position the two factions paraded entirely
around the field clockwise. As they passed the stands the people
cheered and shouted words of encouragement and praise, and when
the warriors had completed the circuit they took their places
again at each end of the field.</p>

<p>Presently a trumpet sounded, and the reds and the whites
approached each other. Now their formations were changed. There
was an advance party and a rear guard, there were flankers on
either side. The cars remained in the rear, just in front of the
rear guard. On running-boards that encircled the cars were a
number of warriors.</p>

<p>I leaned toward Ero Shan. "Tell us something of the idea of
the game," I begged, "so that we may understand and enjoy it
better."</p>

<p>"It is simple," he replied. "They contend for fifteen vir (the
equivalent of sixty minutes of earth time), and the side that
captures the opponent's queen oftenest is the winner."</p>

<p>I do not know what I expected, but certainly not that which
followed. The reds formed a wedge with its apex toward the
whites, then charged. In the mêleé that ensued I saw three men
killed and more than a dozen wounded, but the whites held their
queen.</p>

<p>When a queen was pressed too closely her car turned and fled,
the rear guard coming up to repel the enemy. The tide of battle
moved up and down the field. Sometimes the whites seemed about to
capture the red queen, again their own was in danger. There were
many individual duels and a display of marvelous swordsmanship
throughout.</p>

<p>But the whole thing seemed so out of harmony with all that I
had heretofore seen in Havatoo that I could find no explanation
for it. Here was the highest type of culture and civilization
that man might imagine suddenly reverting to barbarism. It was
inexplicable. And the strangest part of all of it to me was the
almost savage enjoyment with which the people viewed the bloody
spectacle.</p>

<p>I must admit that I found it thrilling, but I was glad when it
was over. Only one queen was captured during the entire game. At
the very last the white queen fell into the hands of the reds,
but only after the last of her defenders had fallen.</p>

<p>Of the two hundred men who took part in the game, not one came
through unwounded; fifty were killed on the field, and I
afterward learned that ten more died of their wounds later.</p>

<p>As we drove from the stadium toward our house I asked Ero Shan
how such a savage and brutal exhibition could be tolerated, much
less enjoyed, by the refined and cultured inhabitants of
Havatoo.</p>

<p>"We have few wars," he replied. "For ages war was man's
natural state. It gave expression to the spirit of adventure
which is a part of his inheritance. Our psychologists discovered
that man must have some outlet for this age-old urge. If it be
not given him by wars or dangerous games he will seek it in the
commission of crimes or in quarrels with his fellows. It is
better that it is so. Without it man would stagnate, he would die
of ennui."</p>

<p><br>I was now working on my plane with the keenest
enthusiasm, for I now saw rapidly taking form such a ship as, I
truly believe, might be built nowhere in the universe other than
in Havatoo. Here I had at my disposal materials that only the
chemists of Havatoo might produce, synthetic wood and steel and
fabric that offered incalculable strength and durability combined
with negligible weight.</p>

<p>I had also the element vik-ro, undiscovered on earth, and the
substance lor to furnish fuel for my engine. The action of the
element vik-ro upon the element yor-san, which is contained in
the substance lor, results in absolute annihilation of the lor.
Some conception of the amount of energy thus released may be
obtained by considering the fact that there is eighteen thousand
million times as much energy liberated by the <i>annihilation</i>
of a ton of coal as by its <i>combustion</i>. Fuel for the life
of my ship could be held in the palm of my hand, and with the
materials that entered into its construction the probable life of
the ship was computed by the physicists working on it to be in
the neighborhood of fifty years. Can you wonder that I looked
forward with impatience to the completion of such a marvel
ship!</p>

<p>At last it was finished! I spent the final afternoon checking
it over carefully with my large corps of assistants. On the
morrow it was to be wheeled out for my trial flight. I knew that
it would be successful. All my assistants knew that it would be;
it was a scientific certainty that it must fly.</p>

<p>That evening I determined to indulge in a little relaxation;
and I called Nalte on the wireless, transmitterless, receiverless
communicating system that is one of the wonders of Havatoo. I
asked her if she would take dinner with me, and she accepted with
an alacrity and display of pleasure that warmed my heart.</p>

<p>We dined in a little public garden on the roof of a building
at the corner of Yorgan Lat and Havatoo Lat, just inside the
river wall at thelower end of Havatoo Lat, the avenue that ex- tends along the water front.</p>

<p>"It seems good to see you again," said Nalte. "It has been a
long time&mdash;not since the war games. I thought you had
forgotten me."</p>

<p>"Far from it," I assured her, "but I have been working day and
night on my airship."</p>

<p>"I have heard some mention of it," she said, "but no one that
I have talked with seemed to understand very much about it. Just
what is it and what will it do?"</p>

<p>"It is a ship that flies through the air faster than a bird
can wing," I replied.</p>

<p>"But what good will that be?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"It will carry people quickly and safely from one place to
another," I explained.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that people will ride in it!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; why else should I build it? That is what it
is for."</p>

<p>"But what will keep it in the air? Will it flap its wings like
a bird?"</p>

<p>"No; it will soar like a bird on stationary wings."</p>

<p>"But how will you get through the forests where the trees grow
close together?"</p>

<p>"I shall fly over the forests."</p>

<p>"So high? Oh, it will be dangerous," she cried. "Please do not
go up in it, Carson Napier."</p>

<p>"It will be very safe," I assured her, "much safer than
incurring the dangers of the forests on foot. No savage beasts or
men can harm the voyager in an airship."</p>

<p>"But think of being way up above the trees!" she said with a
little shudder.</p>

<p>"I shall fly even higher than that," I told her. "I shall fly
over the loftiest mountains."</p>

<p>"But you will never fly over the great trees of Amtor; I know
that," she stated emphatically."</p>

<p>She referred to the gigantic trees that raise their tips five
thousand feet above the surface of Amtor to drink the moisture
from the inner cloud envelope.</p>

<p>"Yes; possibly I shall fly even above those," I replied,
"though I will admit that flying blind in that solid bank of
clouds does not appeal to me."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I shall be afraid every time I know that
you are up in the thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, no you won't, not after you are familiar with it. Some
day soon I am going to take you up with me."</p>

<p>"Not I!"</p>

<p>"We could fly to Andoo," I said. "I have been thinking of that
ever since I started to build the ship."</p>

<p>"To Andoo!" she exclaimed. "Home! Oh, Carson, if we only
could!"</p>

<p>"But we can&mdash;that is if we can find Andoo. This ship will
take us anywhere. If we could carry enough food and water we
could stay in the air for fifty years, and it certainly wouldn't
take that long to find Andoo."</p>

<p>"I love it here in Havatoo," she said, musingly, "but after
all, home is home. I want to see my own people, but I would like
to come back to Havatoo again. That is, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If you are going to be here."</p>

<p><br>I reached across the table and pressed her hand. "We
<i>have</i> been pretty good friends, haven't we, Nalte? I should
miss you terribly if I thought that I were not to see you
again."</p>

<p>"I think that you are the best friend I ever had," she said,
and then she looked up at me quickly and laughed. "Do you know,"
she continued; but stopped suddenly and looked down, as a slight
flush suffused her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Do I know what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I might as well confess. There was a long time that I
thought that I loved you."</p>

<p>"That would have been a great honor, Nalte."</p>

<p>"I tried to hide it because I knew that you loved Duare; and
now recently Ero Shan has been coming to see me, and I know that
I did not know before what love was."</p>

<p>"You love Ero Shan?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am glad. He is a splendid fellow. I know you will both be
happy."</p>

<p>"That might be true but for one thing," she said.</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Ero Shan does not love me."</p>

<p>"How do you know that he doesn't? I don't see how he could
help it. If I had never known Duare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he loved me he would tell me," she interrupted. "Sometimes
I think that he believes that I belong to you. We came here
together, you know, and we have been much together since. But
what's the good in speculating! If he loved me he would not be
able to hide it."</p>

<p>We had finished our dinner, and I suggested that we drive
about the city for a while and then go to a concert.</p>

<p>"Let's take a little walk instead of driving," suggested
Nalte, and as we rose from our table, "How beautiful the view is
from here!"</p>

<p>In the strange glow of the Amtorian night the expanse of the
great river stretched into the vanishing visibility above and
below the city, while on the opposite shore gloomy Kormor was but
a darker blotch against the darkness of the night, with here and
there a few dim lights showing feebly in contrast to brilliant
Havatoo lying at our feet.</p>

<p>We followed the walkway along Havatoo Lat to a narrow side
street that extended away from the river.</p>

<p>"Let's turn here," said Nalte. "I feel like quiet and dim
lights to-night, not the brilliance and the crowds of Havatoo
Lat."</p>

<p>The street that we turned into was in the yorgan section of
the city; it was but dimly lighted, and the walkway was deserted.
It was a quiet and restful street even by comparison with the far
from noisy main avenues of Havatoo, where raucous noises are
anathema.</p>

<p>We had proceeded but a short distance from Havatoo Lat when I
heard a door open behind us and footsteps on the walkway. I gave
the matter no thought; in fact I scarcely had time to give it
thought when some one seized me roughly from behind and as I
wheeled about I saw another man grab Nalte, clap a hand over her
mouth and drag her into the doorway from which the two had
come.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15">XV. &mdash; CITY OF THE DEAD</a></h2>

<p class="first">I TRIED to break away from the man who held me,
but he was very strong. I did succeed in turning about so that I
could strike him; and this I did repeatedly, hitting him in the
face as he sought to reach my throat with his fingers.</p>

<p>We must have made quite a lot of noise in that quiet street
although neither of us spoke, for soon a head was put out of a
window, and presently men and women came running from their
houses. But before any of them reached us I had tripped my
assailant and was on top of him clutching his throat. I would
have choked the life out of him had not several men dragged me
from him.</p>

<p>They were shocked and angry because of this unseemly
disturbance and brawl on a street in Havatoo, and they placed us
under arrest, nor would they listen to what I tried to tell them.
"The judges will listen to you" was all they would say; "it is
not our province to judge."</p>

<p>As every citizen of Havatoo has police powers and there is no
other police force, there was no delay as there would have been
in an earthly city while waiting for the police to answer a
summons.</p>

<p>We were bundled into a large car belonging to one of the
citizens, and with an adequate guard we were whisked away toward
the Sera Tartum.</p>

<p>They do things with celerity in Havatoo. They may have a jail;
I presume they have, but they didn't waste any time or cause the
state any expense by putting us in to be boarded and lodged by
the taxpayers.</p>

<p>Five men were hastily summoned, one from each of the five
upper classes; they were judge, jury, and court of last resort.
They sat in a large room that resembled a huge library; they were
served by a dozen clerks.</p>

<p>One of the judges asked us our names, and when we had given
them two clerks went quickly to the shelves and brought forth
books in which they began to search.</p>

<p>Then the judges asked those who had arrested us to explain why
they brought us in. During the recital of our violation of the
peace of Havatoo one of the clerks, evidently having found what
he sought, laid his book open before the judges; the other was
still searching.</p>

<p>From the open book one of the judges read aloud my official
record since I had come to Havatoo, including the result of the
examination that I had undergone and its embarrassing
finding.</p>

<p>A judge asked me to state my case. In a few brief words I told
of the unprovoked attack upon us and the abduction of Nalte, and
in conclusion I said, "Instead of wasting time trying me for
being the victim of this unwarranted attack and defending myself
against my assailant you should be helping me search for the girl
who has been stolen."</p>

<p>"The peace of Havatoo is of more importance than the life of
any individual," replied a judge. "When we have fixed the
responsibility for this breach of the peace the other matter will
be investigated."</p>

<p>The second clerk now approached the judges. "The name of the
prisoner who calls himself Mal Un does not appear in the records
of Havatoo."</p>

<p>All eyes turned toward my assailant, Mal Un, and for the first
time I had a good look at him under a bright light. I saw his
eyes! Instantly I recalled what I had evidently noticed only
subconsciously before&mdash;the chill of the flesh of his hands
and his throat when I had fought with him. And now those eyes.
They were the eyes of a dead man!</p>

<p>I wheeled toward the judges. "I understand it all now," I
cried. "When I first came to Havatoo I was told that there were
few bad men in the city; but that occasionally, none knew how,
bad men came from the city of Kormor across the river and stole
men and women from Havatoo. This man is from Kormor. He is not a
living man; he is a corpse. He and his companion sought to steal
Nalte and me for Skor!"</p>

<p>With calm efficiency the judges made a few brief and simple,
but none the less effective, tests upon Mal Un; then they
whispered together for a few seconds without leaving the bench.
Following this, the one who acted as spokesman for the tribunal
cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Mal Un," he announced, "you will be decapitated and cremated
forthwith. Carson Napier, you are exonerated with honor. You are
free. You may conduct a search for your companion and call upon
any citizen of Havatoo to assist you in any way that you desire
assistance."</p>

<p>As I was leaving the room I heard a mirthless laugh burst from
the dead mouth of Mal Un. Horribly it rang in my ears as I
hastened out into the night. The dead man laughing because he was
sentenced to death!</p>

<p><br>Naturally, the first person I thought of in my extremity
was Ero Shan. My own car was parked where I had left it at the
corner of Yorgan Lat and Havatoo Lat; so I hailed a public
conveyance and was driven rapidly to the house at which Ero Shan
was being entertained that evening.</p>

<p>I did not go in but sent word that I wished to speak to him
upon a matter of great urgency, and a moment later I saw him
coming from the house toward me.</p>

<p>"What brings you here, Carson?" he asked. "I thought you were
spending the evening with Nalte."</p>

<p>When I told him what had happened he went very white. "There
is no time to be lost!" he cried. "Can you find that house
again?"</p>

<p>I told him that I could. "That doorway is indelibly burned
into my memory."</p>

<p>"Dismiss your car; we will go in mine," he said, and a moment
later we were speeding toward the place where I had lost
Nalte.</p>

<p>"You have all my sympathy, my friend," said Ero Shan. "To have
lost the woman you love, and such a woman! is a calamity beyond
any feeble words to express."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "and even if I had loved Nalte I could
scarcely be more grieved than I now am."</p>

<p>"'Even if you had loved Nalte'!" he repeated incredulously.
"But, man, you do love her, do you not?"</p>

<p>"We were only the best of friends," I replied. "Nalte did not
love me."</p>

<p>Ero Shan made no reply, he drove swiftly on in silence.
Presently we reached our destination. The section of the street
in which the house we sought stood, being very close to a heavily
travelled main artery, accommodated pedestrian traffic on
elevated walkways, unlike residential districts farther removed
from heavy vehicular traffic.</p>

<p>Ero Shan stopped his car beside the stairway, nearest the
house, that led up to the walkway; and a moment later we were
before the door. Repeated summons elicited no response, and then
I tried the door and found it unlocked.</p>

<p>Together we entered the dark interior, and I regretted that we
had brought no weapons; but in peaceful Havatoo men do not
ordinarily go armed. Ero Shan soon located a light switch, and as
the room in which we stood was illuminated, we saw that it was
entirely unfurnished.</p>

<p>The building rose two stories above the walkway, and of course
there was a lower floor on a level with the street. We searched
the upper stories first, and then the roof, for in this part of
Havatoo most of the roofs are developed as gardens; but we found
no sign of recent habitation. Then we went to the ground floor,
but with no better results. Here was space for the parking of
cars, and in rear of that a number of dark storerooms.</p>

<p>"There is no living creature in this house except ourselves,"
said Ero Shan. "They must have taken Nalte to some other house.
It will be necessary to make a search, and only under the
authority of the Sanjong itself may the home of a citizen be
searched. Come! we will go and get that authority."</p>

<p>"You go," I said. "I will remain here. We should keep a
careful watch on this house."</p>

<p>"You are right," he replied. "I shall not be gone long."</p>

<p><br>After Ero Shan's departure I commenced another careful
investigation of the premises. Once again I went through every
room searching for some secret place where a person might be
hidden.</p>

<p>I had covered the upper stories of the house thus, and was
searching the first floor. The dust of neglect lay heavy upon
everything, but I noticed that in one of the back rooms it had
been disturbed upon the floor at a point where Ero Shan and I had
not walked. Previously this had escaped my notice. It seemed to
me that it might be fraught with importance.</p>

<p>I examined the floor carefully. I saw footprints. They
approached a wall; and there they stopped; there seemed to be a
path worn in the dust to this point in the wall. I examined the
wall. It was covered with a form of synthetic wood common in
Havatoo, and when I rapped upon it it sounded hollow.</p>

<p>The wall covering was applied in panels about three feet wide,
and at the top of the panel I was examining was a small round
hole about an inch in diameter. Inserting a forefinger in this
hole I discovered just what I had imagined I would
discover&mdash;a latch. I tripped it; and with a slight pressure
the panel swung toward me, revealing a dark aperture beyond
it.</p>

<p>At my feet I dimly discerned the top of a flight of steps. I
listened intently; no sound came up to me from the gloom into
which the stairs disappeared. Naturally, I was convinced that
Nalte's abductor had carried her down that stairway.</p>

<p>I should have waited for the return of Ero Shan, but I thought
that Nalte might be in danger. I could not think of wasting a
single precious instant in delay.</p>

<p>I placed a foot upon the stairs and started to descend; and as
I did so the panel closed softly behind me, actuated by a spring.
I heard the latch click. I was now in utter darkness. I had to
feel my way. At any moment I might come upon Nalte's abductor
waiting to dispatch me. It was a most uncomfortable
sensation.</p>

<p>The stairway, which was apparently cut from the living
limestone that underlies Havatoo, ran straight down to a great
depth. From the bottom of the stairway I felt my way along a
narrow corridor. Occasionally I stopped and listened. At first I
heard not a sound; the silence was the silence of the grave.</p>

<p>Presently the walls commenced to feel moist; and then,
occasionally, a drop of water fell upon my head. Now a low,
muffled sound like the shadow of a roar seemed to fill the
subterranean corridor like a vague, oppressive menace.</p>

<p>On and on I groped my way. I could not advance rapidly, for I
was compelled to feel every forward footstep before taking it; I
could not know what lay beyond the last.</p>

<p>Thus I continued on for a long distance until finally my
extended foot felt an obstruction. Investigating, I found that it
was the lowest step of a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>Cautiously I ascended, and at the top I came against a blank
wall. But experience had taught me where to search for a latch,
for I was confident that what barred my progress was a door; and
doors have latches.</p>

<p>Presently my fingers found what they sought; a door gave to
the pressure of my hand. I pushed it slowly and cautiously until
a narrow crack permitted me to look beyond it.</p>

<p>I saw a portion of a room dimly illuminated by the night light
of Amtor. I opened the door a little farther; there was no one in
the room. I stepped into it, but before I permitted the door to
close I located the opening through which the latch could be
tripped from that side.</p>

<p><br>The room in which I found myself was filthy and littered
with débris. It was filled with a revolting, musty odor that
suggested death and decay.</p>

<p>In the wall opposite me were three openings, a doorway and two
windows; but there was no window sash and no door. Beyond the
door, to which I now crossed, was a yard inclosed by one side of
the building and a high wall. This yard was in even a more untidy
condition than the room, but at present I was not concerned with
the yard.</p>

<p>There were three rooms on the ground floor of the building,
and these I searched rapidly; they contained only broken
furniture, old rags, and dirt. I went upstairs. Here were three
more rooms; they revealed nothing more of interest than those
downstairs.</p>

<p>Than these six rooms there was nothing more to the house, and
so I was soon aware that I must search farther for Nalte. Neither
she nor any one else was in this house.</p>

<p>From an upper window I looked out over the yard. Beyond the
wall I saw a street. It was a dingy, gloomy street. The houses
that fronted it were drab and dilapidated, but I did not have to
look out upon this scene to know where I was. Long before this I
had guessed that I was in Kormor, the city of the cruel jong of
Morov. The tunnel through which I had passed from Havatoo had
carried me beneath the great river that is called Gerlat kum Rov,
River of Death. Now I knew that Nalte had been abducted by the
agents of Skor.</p>

<p>From the window I saw an occasional pedestrian on the street
that passed the house. They moved with slow, shuffling steps. I
could not but shudder as I contemplated these gruesome figures
that should long have been moldering in their graves, but I did
not give myself over for long to these depressing thoughts. There
was another even more terrible that assailed my mind&mdash;somewhere
in this city of the dead was Nalte in danger so great
that I turned cold at the mere thought of it. I must find her!
But how?</p>

<p>Descending to the yard, I passed through a gateway in the wall
out into the street. Only the natural, nocturnal light of Amtor
illuminated the scene. I did not know which way to go, yet I knew
that I must keep moving if I were not to attract attention. I
must admit that I felt quite helpless and inadequate to the task
before me.</p>

<p>My judgment and my knowledge of Skor suggested that where Skor
was there I would find Nalte, and so I knew that I must find the
jong's palace. If I might only stop one of the pedestrians and
ask him; but that I did not dare do, for to reveal my ignorance
of the location of the jong's palace would be to brand me a
stranger and therefore an enemy.</p>

<p>I was approaching two men who were walking in the opposite
direction to that which I had chosen. As I passed them I noted
their somber garb, and I saw them half stop as we came abreast
and eye me intently. But they did not accost me, and it was with
relief that I realized that they had gone on their way.</p>

<p>Now I understood that with my handsome trappings and my brisk,
alert step and carriage I would be a marked man in Kormor. It
became absolutely imperative, therefore, that I disguise myself;
but that was going to be more easily thought of than
accomplished. However, it must be done. I could never hope to
find and rescue Nalte if I were constantly subject to detection
and arrest.</p>

<p>Turning, I retraced my steps to the mean hovel I had just
quitted, for there I remembered having seen odds and ends of rags
and discarded clothing from among which I hoped that I might
select sufficient to cover my nakedness and replace the fine
apparel I had purchased in Havatoo.</p>

<p>Nor was I disappointed, and a few moments later I emerged
again upon the streets clothed in the cleanest of the foul
garments I had had to select from. And now, to carry out my
disguise to the fullest, I shuffled slowly along like some
carrion from a forgotten grave.</p>

<p>Again I met pedestrians; but this time they gave me no second
look, and I knew that my disguise was ample. To all outward
appearances, in this unlighted city of the dead, I was just
another corpse.</p>

<p>In a few houses dim lights burned; but I heard no
noises&mdash;no singing, no laughter. Somewhere in this city of
horror was Nalte. That so sweet and lovely a creature was
breathing this fetid air was sufficiently appalling, but of far
greater import was the fact that her life hung in the
balance.</p>

<p>If Skor was in the city he might kill her quickly in a fit of
mad revenge because she had escaped him once. My sustaining hope
was that Skor was at his castle and that his minions would hold
Nalte unharmed until he returned to Kormor. But how to learn
these things!</p>

<p>I knew that it would be dangerous to question any of the
inhabitants; but finally I realized that in no other way might I
quickly find the house of Skor, and haste was essential if I were
to find Nalte before it was too late.</p>

<p>As I wandered without plan I saw nothing to indicate that I
was approaching a better section such as I felt might contain the
palace of a jong. The houses were all low and grimy and
unlovely.</p>

<p>I saw a man standing at the intersection of two streets, and
as I came close to him I stopped. He looked at me with his glassy
eyes.</p>

<p>"I am lost," I said.</p>

<p>"We are all lost," he replied, his dead tongue thick in his
dead mouth.</p>

<p>"I cannot find the house where I live."</p>

<p>"Go into any house; what difference does it make?"</p>

<p>"I want to find my own house," I insisted.</p>

<p>"Go and find it then. How should I know where it is if you do
not?"</p>

<p>"It is near the house of the jong," I told him.</p>

<p>"Then go to the house of the jong," he suggested surlily.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" I demanded in the same thick tones.</p>

<p>He pointed down the street that I had been following; and then
he turned and shuffled away in the opposite direction, while I
continued on in the direction he had indicated. I wished to reach
my destination quickly; but I dared not accelerate my speed for
fear of attracting attention, and so I shuffled along in the
lifeless manner of the other wayfarers that I had seen.</p>

<p>Somewhere ahead of me lay the palace of Skor, Jong of Morov;
there I was certain I would find Nalte. But after I found
her&mdash;what?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16">XVI. &mdash; A SURPRISE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE palace of Skor was a three-storied building
of gray stone similar in its ugliness to his castle by the river
in the forest, but it was considerably larger. It stood in no
spacious plaza. Mean hovels were its near neighbors. All about it
was a high wall, and before heavy gates stood a dozen warriors.
It looked impregnable.</p>

<p>I shuffled slowly past the gates, observing from the corners
of my eyes. It seemed useless to attempt to enter there. The
guards were posted for a purpose, and that purpose must be to
keep out those who had no business within. What reason could I
give for wishing to enter?&mdash;what reason that they would
accept?</p>

<p>It was evident that I must seek some other means of ingress.
If I failed to find any then I might return to the gates as a
last resort, but I can tell you that the outlook seemed most
hopeless.</p>

<p>I followed the high wall that inclosed the palace grounds, but
nowhere did I find any place to scale it. It was about twelve
feet high, just too high for me to reach the top with my fingers
by a running jump.</p>

<p>I reached the rear of the palace without discovering any place
where I might scale the wall, and I was convinced that there was
no place. There was plenty of litter and rubbish in the filthy
street that encircled the wall but nothing that I could make use
of as a ladder.</p>

<p>Upon the opposite side of the street were mean hovels, many of
which appeared deserted. In only a few, dim lights revealed a
sign of&mdash;life, I was going to say&mdash;of occupancy.
Directly across from me an open door sagged on a single
hinge. It gave me an idea.</p>

<p>I crossed the street. There were no lights in any of the near-
by houses. That before which I stood appeared tenantless.
Stealthily I crept to the doorway and listened. There was no
sound from the gloom of the interior, but I must make sure that
no one was there.</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, I entered the house. It was a one-story
hovel of two rooms. I searched them both. The house was
unoccupied. Then I returned to the door and examined the
remaining hinge. To my delight I discovered that I could easily
remove the door, and this I did.</p>

<p>I looked up and down the street. There was no one in sight.
Lifting the door, I crossed to the wall and leaned the door
against it. Again I searched the street with my eyes. All was
clear.</p>

<p>Cautiously I crawled up the door. From its top, precariously
gained, I could reach the top of the wall. Then I threw caution
to the winds, drew myself up, and dropped to the ground on the
opposite side. I could not take the chance of remaining even for
an instant on the summit of the wall in plain view of the palace
windows on one side and the street on the other.</p>

<p>I recalled the vicious kazars that Skor kept at his castle,
and I prayed that he kept none here. But no kazar attacked me,
nor did any evidence suggest that my entry had been noted.</p>

<p>Before me loomed the palace, dark and forbidding even though
some lights shone within it. The courtyard was flagged, and as
barren as that of the castle in the wood&mdash;barren of aught
but refuse.</p>

<p>Crossing quickly to the building I walked along it
seeking an entrance. It was three stories high. I saw at least
two towers. Many of the windows were barred, but not all. Behind
one of those barred windows, perhaps, was Nalte. The task before
me was to discover which.</p>

<p>I dared not go to the front of the palace lest I be questioned
by the guard. Presently I discovered a small door; it was the
only door on this side of the building, but it was securely
locked. Carrying my investigation further, I came to an open
window. The room beyond was unlighted. I listened but heard no
sound; then I vaulted quietly to the sill and dropped within. At
last I was inside the palace of the jong of Morov.</p>

<p>Crossing the room, I found a door on the opposite side; and
when I drew it open I saw a dimly lighted corridor beyond. And
with the opening of the door sounds from the interior of the
palace reached my ears.</p>

<p>The corridor was deserted as I stepped into it and made my way
in the direction of the sounds I had heard. At a turning I came
to a broader and better lighted corridor, but here dead men and
women passed to and fro. Some were carrying dishes laden with
food in one direction, others were bearing empty dishes in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>I knew that I risked detection and exposure, but I also knew
that it was a risk I must take sooner or later. As well now, I
thought, as any time. I noticed that these corpses were painted
in the semblance of life and health; only their eyes and their
shuffling gait revealed the truth. My eyes I could not change,
but I kept them lowered as I shuffled into the corridor behind a
man carrying a large platter of food.</p>

<p>I followed him to a large room in which two score men and
women were seated at a banquet table. Here at last, I thought,
were living people&mdash;the masters of Kormor. They did not seem
a very gay company, but that I could understand in surroundings
such as theirs. The men were handsome, the women beautiful. I
wondered what had brought them and what kept them in this horrid
city of death.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of the assemblage was the audience that
packed the room, leaving only sufficient space for the servants
to pass around the table. These people were so well painted that
at first I thought them alive too.</p>

<p>Seeing an opportunity to lose my identity in the crowd, I
wormed my way behind the rear rank and then gradually worked my
way around the room and toward the front rank of the spectators
until I stood directly in rear of a large, thronelike chair that
stood at the head of the table and which I assumed to be Skor's
chair.</p>

<p>Close contact with the men and women watching the banqueters
soon disclosed the fact that I was doubtless the only living
creature among them, for no make-up, however marvelous, could
alter the expressionlessness of those dead eyes or call back the
fire of life or the light of soul. Poor creatures! How I pitied
them.</p>

<p>And now, from the lower end of the chamber, came a blare of
trumpets; and all the banqueters arose and faced in that
direction. Four trumpeters marching abreast entered the banquet
hall, and behind them came eight warriors in splendid harness.
Following these were a man and a woman, partially hidden from my
sight by the warriors and the trumpeters marching in front of
them. These two were followed by eight more warriors.</p>

<p>And now the trumpeters and the warriors separated and formed
an aisle down which the man and the woman walked. Then I saw
them, and my heart stood still. Skor and&mdash;Duare!
The man I loathed, the woman I loved!</p>

<p>Duare's head was still high&mdash;it would be difficult
to break that proud spirit&mdash;but the loathing, the anguish,
the hopelessness in her eyes, struck me like a dagger to the heart.
Yet, even so, hope bounded in my breast as I saw them, for they
<i>were</i> expressions; and they told me that Skor had not yet worked
his worst upon her.</p>

<p>They seated themselves, Skor at the head of the table, Duare
at his right, scarce three paces from me; and the guests resumed
their seats.</p>

<p>I had come for Nalte, and I had found Duare. How was I to
rescue her now that I had found her? I realized that I must do
nothing precipitate. Here, faced by overwhelming odds in the
stronghold of an enemy, I knew that I might accomplish nothing by
force. Strategy and stealth were the weapons that would avail me
most. </p>

<p>I looked about the room. On one side were windows, in the
center of the opposite wall was a small door, at the far end the
large doors through which all seemed to be entering or leaving;
and behind me was another small doorway. I had no plan, but it
was well to note the things that I had noted.</p>

<p>I saw Skor pound on the table with his fist. All the guests
looked up. Skor raised a goblet, and the guests did likewise.</p>

<p>"To the jong!" he cried.</p>

<p>"To the jong!" repeated the guests.</p>

<p>"Drink!" commanded Skor, and the guests drank.</p>

<p>Then Skor addressed them. It was not a speech; it was a
monologue to which all listened. In it occurred what Skor
evidently considered an amusing anecdote. When he had narrated it
he paused, waiting. There was only silence. Skor scowled.
"Laugh!" he snapped, and the guests laughed&mdash;hollow,
mirthless laughs. It was then, with those laughs, that my
suspicions were aroused.</p>

<p>When Skor finished his monologue there was another silence
until he commanded, "Applaud!" Skor smiled and bowed in
acknowledgment of the ensuing applause just as though it had been
spontaneous and genuine.</p>

<p>"Eat!" he commanded, and the guests ate; then he said, "Talk!"
and they commenced to converse.</p>

<p>"Let us be gay!" cried Skor. "This is a happy moment for
Morov. I bring you your future queen!" He pointed to Duare. There
was only silence. "Applaud!" growled Skor, and when they had done
his bidding he urged them again to be gay. "Let us have
laughter," he bid them. "Starting at my left you will take turns
laughing, and when the laughter has passed around the table to
the future queen you will start over again."</p>

<p>The laughter commenced. It rose and fell as it passed around
the table. God, what a travesty on gayety it was!</p>

<p>I had passed closer until I stood directly behind Skor's
chair. Had Duare turned her eyes in my direction she must have
seen me, but she did not. She sat staring straight before
her, avoiding the dead eyes of the horrid guests.</p>

<p>Skor leaned toward her and spoke. "Are they not fine
specimens?" he demanded. "You see I am coming closer and closer
to the fulfillment of my dream. Do you not see how different are
all the people of Kormor from the mean creatures at my castle?
And look at these, the guests at my table. Even their eyes have
the semblance of real life. Soon I shall have it&mdash;I shall be
able to breathe full life into the dead. Then think what a nation
I can create! And I shall be jong, and you shall be vadjong."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to be vadjong," replied Duare. "I only wish my
liberty."</p>

<p>A dead man sitting across the table from her said, "That is
all that any of us wishes, but we shall never get it." It was
then his turn to laugh, and he laughed. It was incongruous,
horrible. I saw Duare shudder.</p>

<p>Skor's sallow face paled. He glowered at the speaker. "I
am about to give you life," cried the jong angrily, "and you do
not appreciate it."</p>

<p>"We do not wish to live," replied the corpse. "We wish death.
Let us have death and oblivion again&mdash;let us return to our
graves in peace."</p>

<p>At these words, Skor flew into a fit of rage. He half rose,
and drawing a sword struck at the face of the speaker. The keen
blade laid open an ugly wound from temple to chin. The edges of
the wound gaped wide, but no blood flowed.</p>

<p>The dead man laughed. "You cannot hurt the dead," he
mocked.</p>

<p>Skor was livid. He sought words, but his rage choked him.
Flecks of foam whitened his lips. If ever I have looked upon a
madman it was then. Suddenly he turned upon Duare.</p>

<p>"You are the cause of this!" he screamed. "Never say such
things again before my subjects. You shall be queen! I will make
you queen of Morov, a living queen, or I will make you one of
these. Which do you choose?"</p>

<p>"Give me death," replied Duare.</p>

<p>"That you shall never have&mdash;not real death, only the
counterfeit that you see before you&mdash;neither life nor
death."</p>

<p>At last the ghastly meal drew to a close. Skor arose and
motioned Duare to accompany him. He did not leave the room as he
had entered it; no trumpeters nor warriors accompanied him. He
walked toward the small doorway at the rear of the room, the
spectators giving way before him and Duare as they advanced.</p>

<p>So suddenly had Skor risen and turned that I thought he must
surely see me; but if he did he did not recognize me, and a
moment later he had passed me, and the danger was over. And as he
and Duare moved toward the doorway I fell in behind and followed.
Each instant I expected to feel a hand upon my shoulder stopping
me, but no one seemed to pay any attention to me. I passed
through the doorway behind Skor and Duare without a challenge.
Even Skor did not turn as he raised the hangings at the doorway
and let them fall again behind him.</p>

<p>I moved softly, making no noise. The corridor in which we were
was deserted. It was a very short corridor, ending at a heavy
door. As Skor threw this door open I saw a room beyond that at
first I thought must be a storeroom. It was large and almost
completely filled with a heterogeneous collection of odds and
ends of furniture, vases, clothing, arms, and pictures.
Everything was confusion and disorder, and everything was covered
with dust and dirt.</p>

<p>Skor paused for a moment on the threshold, seemingly viewing
the room with pride. "What do you think of it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Think of what?" asked Duare.</p>

<p>"This beautiful room," he said. "In all Amtor there cannot be
a more beautiful room; nowhere else can there be another such
collection of beautiful objects; and now to them I am adding the
most beautiful of all&mdash;you! This, Duare, is to be your
room&mdash;the private apartment of the queen of Morov."</p>

<p>I stepped in and closed the door behind me, for I had seen
that but for us three there was no one else in the apartment; and
now seemed as good a time to act as any.</p>

<p>I had not meant to make any noise as I entered. Skor was armed
and I was not, and it had been my intention to throw myself upon
him from the rear and overpower him before he could have an
opportunity to use his weapons against me. But the lock of the
door clicked as I closed it, and Skor wheeled and faced me.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17">XVII. &mdash; IN HIDING</a></h2>

<p class="first">As the eyes of the jong of Morov fell upon me he
recognized me, and he voiced a sardonic laugh as he whipped out
his sword and brought my charge to a sudden, ignominious
stop&mdash;one does not finish a charge with the point of a sword
in one's belly.</p>

<p>"So-o!" he exclaimed; "it is you? Well, well. It is good to see
you again. I did not expect to be so honored. I thought Fortune
had been very kind to me when she returned the two young women.
And now you have come! What a merry party we shall have!"</p>

<p>With the last words his tone, which had been sarcastically
bantering, changed; he fairly hissed that gay sentence. And the
expression on his face changed too. It became suddenly
malevolent, and his eyes glittered with the same mad fire of
insanity that I had seen there before.</p>

<p>Behind him stood Duare, her wide eyes fixed upon me with
incredulity mixed with terror. "Oh, why did you come, Carson?"
she cried. "Now he will kill you."</p>

<p>"I will tell you why he came," said Skor. "He came for the
other girl, for Nalte, not for you. You have been here a long
time, but he did not come. To-night one of my people seized the
girl, Nalte, in Havatoo; and he came immediately to try to rescue
her, the fool. I have known for a long time that they were in
Havatoo. My spies have seen them there together. I do not know
how he got here, but here he is&mdash;and here he stays,
forever."</p>

<p>He poked me in the belly with the point of his sword. "How
would you like to die, fool?" he snarled. "A quick thrust through
the heart, perhaps. That would mutilate you least. You will make
a fine specimen. Come, now, what have you to say? Remember this
will be the last chance you will have to think with your own
brain; hereafter I shall do your thinking for you. You will sit
in my banquet hall, and you will laugh when I tell you to laugh.
You will see the two women who loved you, but they will shrink
from the touch of your clammy hands, from your cold, dead lips.
And whenever you see them they will be with Skor in whose veins
flows the bright blood of life."</p>

<p>My plight seemed quite hopeless. The sword at my belly was
long, keen, and two-edged. I might have grasped it, but its edges
were so sharp that it would have slipped through my fingers,
severing them as it plunged into my body. Yet that I intended
doing. I would not wait like a sheep the lethal blow of the
butcher.</p>

<p>"You do not reply," said Skor. "Very well, we will have it
over quickly!" He drew back his sword hand for the thrust.</p>

<p>Duare was standing just behind him beside a table littered
with the sort of junk to which Skor seemed partial&mdash;his
crazy <i>objets d'art</i>. I was waiting to seize the blade when
he thrust. Skor hesitated a moment, I presume to better enjoy my
final agony; but in that he was disappointed. I would not give
him that satisfaction; and so, to rob him of most of his
pleasure, I laughed in his face.</p>

<p>At that moment Duare raised a heavy vase from the table, held
it high above her, and crashed it down on Skor's head. Without a
sound he sank to the floor.</p>

<p>I leaped across his body to take Duare into my arms, but with
a palm against my breast she pushed me away.</p>

<p>"Do not touch me!" she snapped. "If you want to get out of
Kormor there is no time to be wasted. Come with me! I know where
the girl you came to rescue is imprisoned."</p>

<p><br>Her whole attitude toward me seemed to have changed, and
my pride was piqued. In silence I followed her from the room. She
led me into the corridor along which we had approached the room
to which I had followed her and Skor. Opening a door at one side,
she hurried along another corridor and stopped before a heavily
bolted door.</p>

<p>"She is in here," she said.</p>

<p>I drew the bolts and opened the door. Standing in the middle
of the room beyond, looking straight at me, was Nalte. As she
recognized me she gave a little cry of joy and, running toward
me, threw her arms about me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Carson! Carson!" she cried. "I knew that you would come;
something told me that you would come."</p>

<p>"We must hurry," I told her. "We must get out of here."</p>

<p>I turned toward the door. Duare stood there, her chin in the
air, her eyes flashing; but she said nothing. Nalte saw her then
and recognized her. "Oh, it is you!" she exclaimed. "You are
alive! I am so glad. We thought that you had been killed."</p>

<p>Duare seemed puzzled by the evident sincerity of Nalte's
manner, as though she had not expected that Nalte would be glad
that she was alive. She softened a little. "If we are to escape
from Kormor, though I doubt that we can, we must not remain
here," she said. "I think that I know a way out of the
castle&mdash;a secret way that Skor uses. He showed me the door
once during some strange mood of his insanity; but he has the key
to the door on his person, and we must get that before we can do
anything else."</p>

<p>We returned to the room where we had left Skor's body, and as
I entered it I saw the jong of Morov stir and try to rise. He was
not dead, though how he had survived that shattering blow I do
not know. We had come just in time.</p>

<p>I ran toward him and threw him down. He was still only half
conscious and made little or no resistance. I suppose I should
have killed him, but I shrank from kill ng a defenseless
man&mdash;even a fiend like Skor. Instead I bound and gagged him;
then I searched him and found his keys.</p>

<p>After that Duare led us to the second floor of the palace and
to a large room furnished in the bizarre taste that was Skor's.
She crossed the apartment and drew aside a grotesque hanging,
revealing a small door behind it.</p>

<p>"Here is the door," she said; "see if you can find a key to
fit the lock."</p>

<p>I tried several keys, and at last found the right one. The
opened door revealed a narrow corridor which we entered after
rearranging the hangings, and then closed the door behind us. A
few steps brought us to the top of a spiral staircase. I went
first, carrying Skor's sword which I had taken from him with his
keys. The two girls followed closely behind me.</p>

<p>The stairway was lighted, for which I was glad, since it
permitted us to move more rapidly and with greater safety. At the
bottom was another corridor. I waited there until both girls
stood beside me.</p>

<p>"Do you know where this corridor leads?" I asked Duare.</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "All that Skor said was that he could get
out of the castle this way without any one seeing him&mdash;he
always came and went this way. Practically everything that he
did, the most commonplace things in life, he veiled with mystery
and secrecy."</p>

<p>"From the height of that stairway," I said, "I believe that we
are below the ground level of the palace. I wish that we knew
where this corridor ends, but there is only one way to find out.
Come on!"</p>

<p>This corridor was but dimly illuminated by the light from
the stairway, and the farther we went from the stairway the
darker it became. It ran straight for a considerable distance,
ending at the foot of a wooden stairway. Up this I groped my way
only a few steps, when my head came in contact with a solid
substance above me. I reached up and felt of the obstruction. It
consisted of planking and was obviously a trap door. I tried to
raise it, but could not. Then I searched around its edges with my
fingers, and at last I found that which I sought&mdash;a latch.
Tripping it, I pushed again; and the door gave. I opened it only
an inch or two, but no light showed in the crack. Then I opened
it wider and raised my head through the aperture.</p>

<p>Now I could see more, but not much more&mdash;only the dark
interior of a room with a single small window through which the
night light of Amtor showed dimly. Grasping the sword of the jong
of Morov more tightly, I ascended the stairway and entered the
room. I heard no sound.</p>

<p>The girls had followed me and now stood just behind me. I
could hear them breathing. We stood waiting, listening. Slowly my
eyes became accustomed to the darkness, and I made out what I
thought was a door beside the single window. I crossed to it and
felt; it was a door, but what lay beyond? </p>

<p>Cautiously I opened it and looked out into one of the sordid
streets of Kormor. I peered about in an effort to orient myself
and saw that the street was one of those that extended directly
away from the palace which I could see looming darkly behind its
wall at my right.</p>

<p>"Come!" I whispered, and with the girls behind me I stepped
out into the street and turned to the left. "If we meet any one,"
I cautioned, "remember to walk like the dead, shuffle along as
you will see me do. Keep your eyes on the ground; it is our eyes
that will most surely betray us."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Duare in a whisper.</p>

<p>"I am going to try to find the house through which I came into
the city," I replied; "but I don't know that I can do so."</p>

<p>"And if you can't?"</p>

<p>"Then we shall have to make an attempt to scale the city wall;
but we shall find a way, Duare."</p>

<p>"What difference will it make?" she murmured, half to herself.
"If we escape from here there will only be something else. I
think I would rather be dead than go on any more."</p>

<p>The note of hopelessness in her voice was so unlike Duare that
it shocked me. "You mustn't feel like that, Duare," I
expostulated. "If we can get back to Havatoo you will be safe and
happy, and I have a surprise there for you that will give you new
hope." I was thinking of the plane in which we might hope to find
Vepaja, the country that I could see she had about despaired of
ever seeing again.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "There is no hope, no hope of happiness,
ever, for Duare."</p>

<p>Some figures approaching us along the dusty street put an end
to our conversation. With lowered eyes and shuffling feet we
neared them. They passed, and I breathed again in relief.</p>

<p>It would be useless to recount our futile search for the house
I could not find. All the remainder of the night we searched, and
with the coming of dawn I realized that we must find a place to
hide until night came again.</p>

<p>I saw a house with a broken door, no unusual sight in dismal
Kormor; and investigation indicated that it was tenantless. We
entered and ascended to the second floor. Here, in a back room,
we prepared to await the ending of the long day that lay ahead of
us.</p>

<p>We were all tired, almost exhausted; and so we lay down on the
rough planks and sought to sleep. We did not talk; each seemed
occupied with his own dismal thoughts. Presently, from their
regular breathing, I realized that the girls were both asleep;
and very shortly thereafter I must have fallen asleep myself.</p>

<p><br>How long I slept I do not know. I was awakened by
footsteps in an adjoining room. Some one was moving about, and I
heard mutterings as of a person talking to himself.</p>

<p>Slowly I rose to my feet, holding Skor's sword in readiness.
Its uselessness against the dead did not occur to me, yet had it,
I still would have felt safer with the sword in my hand.</p>

<p>The footsteps approached the door to the room in which we had
sought sanctuary, and a moment later an old woman stopped upon
the threshold and looked at me in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she demanded.</p>

<p>If she was surprised, no less was I; for old age was something
I had never before seen in Amtor. Her voice awakened the girls,
and I heard them rising to their feet behind me.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" repeated the old woman querulously.
"Get out of my house, accursed corpses! I'll have none of the
spawn of Skor's evil brain in my house!"</p>

<p>I looked at her in astonishment. "Aren't you dead?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm not dead!" she snapped.</p>

<p>"Neither are we," I told her.</p>

<p>"Eh? Not dead?" She came closer. "Let me see your eyes. No,
they do not look like dead eyes; but they say that Skor has found
some foul way in which to put a false light of life into dead
eyes."</p>

<p>"We are not dead," I insisted.</p>

<p>"Then what are you doing in Kormor? I thought that I knew all
of the living men and women here, and I do not know you. Are the
women alive too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are all alive." I thought quickly. I wondered if I
might trust her with our secret and seek her aid. She evidently
hated Skor, and we were already in her power if she wished to
denounce us. I felt that we could not be much worse off in any
event. "We were prisoners of Skor. We escaped. We want to get out
of the city. We are at your mercy. Will you help us?&mdash;or
will you turn us over to Skor to be murdered?"</p>

<p>"I won't turn you over to Skor," she snapped. "I wouldn't turn
a dead mistal over to that fiend; but I don't know how I can help
you. You can't get out of Kormor. The dead sentries along the
wall never sleep."</p>

<p>"I got into Kormor without being seen by a sentry," I said.
"If I could only find the house I could get out again."</p>

<p>"What house?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"The house at the end of the tunnel that runs under Gerlat kum
Rov to Havatoo."</p>

<p>"A tunnel to Havatoo! I never heard of such a thing. Are you
sure?"</p>

<p>"I came through it last night."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "None of us ever heard of it&mdash;and if
we who live here cannot find it, how could you, a stranger, hope
to? But I'll help as much as I can. At least I can hide you and
give you food. We always help one another here in Kormor, we who
are alive."</p>

<p>"There are other living people in Kormor?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A few," she replied. "Skor has not succeeded in hunting us
all down yet. We live a mean life, always hiding; but it is life.
If he found us he would make us like those others."</p>

<p>The old woman came closer. "I cannot believe that you are
alive," she said. "Perhaps you are tricking me." She touched my
face, and then ran her palms over the upper part of my body. "You
are warm," she said, and then she felt my pulse. "Yes, you are
alive."</p>

<p>Similarly she examined Duare and Nalte, and at last she was
convinced that we had told her the truth. "Come," she said, "I
will take you to a better place than this. You will be more
comfortable. I do not use this house very often."</p>

<p>She led us downstairs and out into a yard at the rear of
which stood another house. It was a mean house, poorly furnished.
She took us into a back room and told us to remain there.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want food," she said.</p>

<p>"And water," added Nalte; "I have had none since yesterday
evening."</p>

<p>"You poor thing," said the old woman. "I'll get it for you.
How young and pretty you are. Once I was young and pretty
too."</p>

<p>"Why have you aged?" I asked. "I thought that all the people
of Amtor held the secret of longevity."</p>

<p>"Aye, but how may one obtain the serum in Kormor? We had it
once, before Skor came; but he took it away from us. He said that
he would create a new race that would not require it, for they
would never grow old. The effects of my last innoculation have
worn off, and now I am growing old and shall die. It is not so
bad to die&mdash;if Skor does not find one's corpse. We of the
living here bury our dead in secret beneath the floors of our
houses. My mate and our two children lie beneath this floor. But
I must go and fetch food and water for you. I shall not be gone
long." And with that, she left us.</p>

<p>"Poor old creature," said Nalte. "She has nothing to look
forward to except the grave, with the chance that Skor may rob
her of even that poor future."</p>

<p>"How strange she looked!" There was a shocked expression in
Duare's eyes as she spoke. "So that is old age! I never saw it
before. That is the way I should look some day, were it not for
the serum! How ghastly! Oh, I should rather die than be like
that. Old age! Oh, how terrible!"</p>

<p>Here was a unique experience. I was witnessing the reactions
of a nineteen-year-old girl who had never before seen the ravages
of old age, and I could not but wonder if the subconscious effect
of old age on youth accustomed to seeing it was not similar. But
these meditations were interrupted by the return of the old
woman, and I caught a new insight into the character of
Duare.</p>

<p>As the old woman entered the room, her arms laden, Duare ran
forward and took the things from her. "You should have let me
come with you and help you," she said. "I am younger and
stronger."</p>

<p>Then she placed the food and water upon a table, and with a
sweet smile she put an arm about the withered shoulders of the
old crone and drew her toward a bench. "Sit down," she said.
"Nalte and I will prepare the food. You just sit here and rest
until it is ready, and then we shall all eat together."</p>

<p>The old woman looked at her in astonishment for a moment and
then burst into tears. Duare dropped to the bench beside her and
put her arms about her. "Why do you cry?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I cry," sobbed the old creature. "I feel
like singing, but I cry. It has been so long since I have heard
kind words, since any one has cared whether I was happy or sad,
tired or rested."</p>

<p>I saw the tears come to Duare's eyes and to Nalte's, and they
had to busy themselves with the preparation of the food to hide
their emotions.</p>

<p>That night a dozen of the living of Kormor came to the house
of Kroona, the old woman who had befriended us. They were all
very old, some of them older than Kroona. They laughed at
Kroona's fears that Skor wanted them; and pointed out, as
evidently they had many times before, that if it was old bodies
Skor wanted he long since could have found them, for their old
age was ample evidence that they were of the living. But Kroona
insisted that they were all in danger; and I soon realized that
it was her pet obsession, without which she would probably be
more miserable than she was with it. She got a great thrill out
of leading a life of constant danger and hiding first in one
house and then in another.</p>

<p>But they were all of one opinion that we were in great danger,
and the dear old things pledged themselves to help us in every
way they could&mdash;to bring us food and water and hide us from
our enemies. That was all that they could do, for none of them
believed that it was possible to escape from Kormor&mdash;such
is the hopelessness of old age. </p>

<p><br>Early the following morning a very old man, one of the
visitors of the previous evening, hobbled into the house. He was
perturbed and greatly excited. His palsied hands were trembling.
"They are searching the city for you," he whispered. "There is a
terrible story of what you did to Skor and of what Skor will do
to you when he finds you. All night and all day and all last
night he lay bound and helpless where you left him; then one of
his creatures found and released him. Now the whole city is being
scoured for you. They may be here any minute."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" asked Duare, "Where can we hide?"</p>

<p>"You can do nothing," said the old man, "but wait until they
come. There is no place in all Kormor that they will not
search."</p>

<p>"We can do something," said Nalte; then she turned to our
informant. "Can you get us paints such as the corpses use to make
themselves appear like living men?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Well, go quickly and fetch them," urged Nalte.</p>

<p>The old man hobbled out of the room, mumbling to himself.</p>

<p>"It is the only way, Nalte," I cried. "I believe that if he
returns in time we can fool them; dead men are not very
bright."</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before the old man came back; but he
came finally, and he brought a large box of make-up with him. It
was quite an elaborate affair which he said that he had obtained
from a friend of his, a living man, whose craft was applying the
make-up to corpses.</p>

<p>Quickly Nalte went to work on Duare and soon had transformed
her into an old woman with lines and wrinkles and hollows. The
hair was the most difficult problem to solve, but we finally
succeeded in approximating the results we desired, though we used
up all of the cosmetician's white pigment, rubbing it into our
hair.</p>

<p>Duare and I together worked on Nalte, for we knew that we had
no time to spare, the old man having brought word when he
returned with the make-up that the searchers were working in the
next block and coming our way; then Nalte and Duare transformed
me into a very sad looking old man.</p>

<p>Kroona said that we should each have some task that we could
be performing when the searchers arrived, to that we might appear
natural. She gave Duare and Nalte some old rags which they might
pretend to be fashioning into garments, and she sent me out into
the yard to dig a hole. It was fortunate that she did so, because
the association of ideas resulting reminded me that I must hide
Skor's sword. Were that found we were doomed.</p>

<p>I wrapped it up in a piece of cloth and carried it out into
the yard with me, and you may take my word for it that I dug one
hole there in record time. When I had covered the sword with dirt
I started digging another hole beside it and threw that dirt also
on the spot above the weapon.</p>

<p>I had just finished when the yard gate was thrown open and a
score of dead men came shuffling in. "We are looking for the
strangers who escaped from the palace," said one. "Are they
here?"</p>

<p>I cupped my hand behind my ear and said, "Eh?"</p>

<p>The fellow repeated his question, shouting very loud, and
again I did the same thing and said, "Eh?" Then he gave up and
went on into the house, followed by the others.</p>

<p>I heard them searching in there, and every instant I expected
to hear cries of excitement when one of them discovered and
pierced the thin disguises of Duare and Nalte.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; UNDER SUSPICION</a></h2>

<p class="first">SKOR'S creature's searched Kroona's house far
more carefully than they would have searched that of one of their
own kind, for Skor must have assumed that of all the people in
Kormor the living would be most likely to aid the living; but at
last they came out and went away. And I sat down on the pile of
dirt I had dug and mopped the perspiration from my forehead, nor
was it the sweat of toil. I think that for fifteen minutes I had
come as near to sweating blood as a man can.</p>

<p>When I went into the house I found Duare, Nalte, and Kroona
just sitting there in dazed silence. They couldn't seem to
realize that we had passed through the ordeal successfully.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "that's over."</p>

<p>My voice seemed to break the spell.</p>

<p>"Do you know what saved us?" demanded Nalte.</p>

<p>"Why, our disguises, of course," I replied.</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted, "they helped, but our real salvation was
the stupidity of the searchers. They scarcely looked at us. They
were hunting for somebody who was <i>hidden</i>, and because we
were not hiding they didn't give us a second thought."</p>

<p>"Do you think we might remove the paint now?" asked Duare. "It
is very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"I think we should not remove it at all," I replied. "As we
know, they won't find us in this search; so Skor may order
another search, and next time we may not have time to disguise
ourselves even if we are lucky enough to get the materials
again."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," said Duare, "and after all the
discomfort is not much by comparison to what we have already gone
through."</p>

<p>"The disguises have one advantage," said Nalte. "We can move
about more freely without danger of detection. We won't have to
sit in this stuffy little back room all the time, and I for one
am going to the front of the house and get a breath of fresh
air."</p>

<p>It was not a bad suggestion, and Duare and I joined Nalte
while Kroona went about some household duties. The front room on
the second floor, to which we went, overlooked the street. We
could hear the searchers ransacking the house next door, and we
could see the pedestrians shuffling along the dusty street.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nalte seized my arm and pointed. "See that man?" she
exclaimed in an excited whisper.</p>

<p>Shuffling along the street was a large corpse painted in the
semblance of life. His trappings were finer than those ordinarily
seen in Kormor. Only his peculiar gait revealed to the initiated
eye the fact that he was not as alive as we, that Death was
masquerading as Life </p>

<p>"Yes, I see him," I replied. "What about him?"</p>

<p>"He is the man that abducted me from Havatoo!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," replied Nalte. "As long as I live I shall never
forget that face."</p>

<p>A plan, perhaps I had better call it an inspiration, shot into
my mind. "I am going to follow him," I said. "I shall be back
soon; hope for the best." I turned and hurried from the room.</p>

<p><br>A moment later I was in the street. The fellow was only a
short distance ahead of me. If my guess was correct he would lead
me eventually to the entrance to the tunnel that leads to
Havatoo. Perhaps not to-day, but if I learned where he lived to-
day; then some other day.</p>

<p>His gait was more rapid than that of the average Kormoran, and
he walked as though with a definite purpose in view. I judged
that he was one of Skor's more successful experiments and that
for this reason he had been chosen as one of the jong's agents in
Havatoo, where the ordinary run of Kormoran corpses could not
long have passed themselves off as living men.</p>

<p>As I followed him I noted carefully every detail of the street
in which we were; so that I would not again be unable to return
to my starting point. When presently he turned into a street
leading toward the river my hopes rose, and I noted carefully the
buildings at the intersection.</p>

<p>Near the river the fellow turned into a small alley, followed
it to the next street, and then turned again toward the river.
Directly ahead of us, even before he turned into it, I saw and
recognized the building beneath which lay the Kormor end of the
tunnel.</p>

<p>At the gateway leading into the yard before the house the man
turned for the first time and looked behind him, I presume to see
if he was being observed. Then he saw me.</p>

<p>There was nothing for me to do but keep on toward him. I kept
my eyes on the ground and paid no attention to him as I
approached him, though I could almost feel his gaze upon me. It
seemed an eternity before I reached him. I was about to breathe a
sigh of relief as I passed him, then he spoke to me.</p>

<p>"Who are you and what are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am looking for another house to live in," I cackled. "The
doors and the windows have all fallen off mine."</p>

<p>"There are no houses here for you," he snapped. "Your kind is
not allowed in this district. Get out of here and never let me
see you here again."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied meekly, and turned back.</p>

<p>To my great joy he let me go, and a moment later I had turned
into the alley and was hidden from his view. But I had learned
what I wanted to know, and my blood was tingling with happiness.
Now only the worst of ill fortune could prevent me guiding Duare
and Nalte back to the safety of Havatoo.</p>

<p>As I made my way through the streets of Kormor toward the
house of Kroona my mind was filled with thoughts and plans for
escape. I was determined to leave as soon as darkness fell, and
already I was looking forward to and planning on what I should do
upon my return to Havatoo.</p>

<p>As I entered Kroona's house I saw immediately, even before any
one had a chance to speak, that something was amiss. Duare and
Nalte both rushed toward me, and it was evident that both were
perturbed. Kroona and the old man who had brought us the pigments
with which we had disguised ourselves were cackling together
excitedly.</p>

<p>"At last you are back!" cried Nalte. "We thought that you
would never come."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is not too late even now," said Duare.</p>

<p>"I wanted them to come with me and let me hide them," croaked
Kroona, "but neither one of them would leave without you. They
said that if you were to be taken then they would be taken
too."</p>

<p>"What in the world are you all talking about?" I demanded.
"What has happened? I can't make head nor tail of it."</p>

<p>"It is soon told," said the old man who had brought us the
make-up. "The cosmetician from whom I borrowed the materials to
change you into old people has betrayed us in order to curry
favor with Skor. A man heard him tell his servant to go to the
palace and inform Skor that he would lead Skor's men to this
hiding place of yours. The man was a friend of mine and came and
told me. Skor's men may be here at any minute now."</p>

<p><br>I thought rapidly; then I turned to Duare and Nalte. "Get
your make-up off as quickly as you can," I directed, "and I will
do the same."</p>

<p>"But then we shall be lost for certain," exclaimed Duare.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," I replied as I commenced to remove the
pigment from my blond head.</p>

<p>"They will know us at once without our disguises," insisted
Duare, but I was glad to see that both she and Nalte were
following my example and removing the paint from their hair and
faces.</p>

<p>"Our own youth will be the best disguise we can adopt in this
emergency," I explained. "These creatures of Skor are none too
intelligent, and having been sent to find three fugitives who
have disguised themselves as very old people they will be looking
only for those who appear very old. If we can get out of the
house before they come I think we have a good chance to avoid
detection."</p>

<p>We worked rapidly and soon had the last vestiges of our
disguises removed; then we thanked Kroona and the old man, bid
them good-by, and left the house. As we entered the street we saw
a body of warriors approaching from the direction of the
palace.</p>

<p>"We were not quite in time," said Nalte. "Shall we turn and
run for it?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "That would only arouse their suspicions
immediately and they would pursue and most certainly overtake us.
Come! We shall go and meet them."</p>

<p>"What!" demanded Duare in astonishment. "Are we going to give
ourselves up?"</p>

<p>"By no means," I replied. "We are going to take a great
chance, but there is no alternative. If they see three people
walking away from them they will investigate, and if they do that
we may be recognized; but if they see us approaching them they
will believe that we do not fear anything from them and will be
convinced therefore that we are not those whom they seek. Walk
with the shuffling gait of the dead, and keep your eyes on the
ground. Duare, you walk ahead, Nalte a few paces behind you; I
shall cross to the other side of the street. By separating we
shall attract less attention; they are looking for three people
whom they expect to find together."</p>

<p>"I hope your reasoning is correct," said Duare, but it was
evident that she was skeptical. I was none too enthusiastic about
the plan myself, but I could think of no other. </p>

<p>I crossed the street to the side along which the warriors were
approaching, knowing that there was less likelihood that any of
them would recognize me than that they would know Duare, who had
been in Skor's palace for some time.</p>

<p>I must admit that I felt none too comfortable as the distance
between me and the warriors steadily lessened, but I kept my eyes
on the ground and shuffled slowly along.</p>

<p>As I came abreast of them their leader halted and addressed
me. My heart stood still. "Where is the house of Kroona?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I replied and shuffled on my way. Momentarily
I expected to be seized, but the warriors went on their way and
let me go on mine. My ruse had been successful!</p>

<p>As soon as I felt that it was safe I crossed to the opposite
side of the street, and as I caught up with the two girls I told
them to follow behind me but not too closely.</p>

<p>It still lacked an hour until sunset, and I did not dare risk
approaching the entrance to the tunnel until after dark. In the
meantime we must find a place to hide and keep off the streets
where every moment we were in danger of arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>Turning into a side street I soon found a deserted house, of
which there are many in Kormor; and presently we were in hiding
again.</p>

<p><br>Both girls were dejected. I could tell by their silence
and listlessness. The future must have seemed hopeless to them,
yet they voiced no complaints.</p>

<p>"I have some good news for you," I said.</p>

<p>Duare looked at me with scarcely any indication of interest,
as though there never could be any good news for her again. She
had been unusually silent since our escape from the palace. She
seldom spoke unless directly addressed; and she avoided speech
with Nalte as much as possible, although her manner toward her
was not definitely unfriendly.</p>

<p>"What is the good news?" demanded Nalte. "I was commencing to
give up hope."</p>

<p>"I have found the entrance to the tunnel to Havatoo," I
replied.</p>

<p>The effect of that statement upon Nalte was electrical, but it
seemed to arouse only passive interest in Duare. "In Havatoo,"
she said, "I shall be as far as ever from Vepaja."</p>

<p>"But your life will not be in danger," I reminded her.</p>

<p>She shrugged. "I do not know that I care to live," she
replied.</p>

<p>"Don't be discouraged, Duare," I begged. "Once we are in
Havatoo I am confident that I shall discover a way to find Vepaja
and return you to your people." I was thinking of the plane ready
and waiting in its hangar on Kantum Lat, but I didn't say
anything about it. I wanted to save it as a surprise for her;
and, anyway, we were not yet in Havatoo.</p>

<p><br>The two hours that we waited until complete darkness enveloped
the city were as long a two hours as I have ever spent; but at
last it seemed safe to attempt to reach the silent, deserted
house near the river front, where all our hopes were
centered.</p>

<p>The street was deserted when we left the building where we had
been hiding; I was certain of my way to our destination, and
without delay or adventure we at last came in sight of the
decaying structure that hid the entrance to our avenue of
escape.</p>

<p>I led the girls into the dark interior of the building, and
there we huddled in the dark, listening. I regretted then that I
had been unable to retrieve the sword I had taken from Skor and
buried in the yard of Kroona's home. It would have given me a
feeling of far greater security than I now enjoyed.</p>

<p>Satisfied at last that we were the sole occupants of the
building and that no one had followed us, I crossed to the
doorway that hid the entrance to the tunnel, Duare and Nalte
close behind me.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in finding the latch, and a moment later
we were descending into the dark corridor with liberty and safety
almost in our grasp.</p>

<p>There was a chance that we might meet one of Skor's creatures
returning from Havatoo; but I felt that everything was in our
favor inasmuch as one of them had just crossed in the opposite
direction, and there had never been any evidence that they were
in Havatoo in great numbers. It was my opinion that the two that
set upon Nalte and me were alone in that venture, and if that
were true it was also doubtless true that Skor never had more
than a couple of his retainers in Havatoo at the same time. I
certainly hoped that I was right.</p>

<p>In silence, through the utter darkness, we groped our way
along the cold, moist corridor beneath the River of Death. I
moved more rapidly than I had when I had come through it to
Kormor, for I knew now that no pitfalls lay in my path.</p>

<p>At last I felt the stairs leading upward at the tunnel's end,
and a moment later I stopped behind the door that would let us
into Havatoo. I did not wait; I did not listen. Nothing could
have stopped me then. I would have grappled a dozen of the
gruesome corpses of Kormor had they stood in my way, and I
believe that I should have overcome them, so desperate was I.</p>

<p>But we met neither dead nor living as we stepped out onto the
lower floor of the dismal building off the Havatoo Lat. Quickly
we crossed to the front of the building and out through the door
there to the street beyond, and a moment later we stood in the
Havatoo Lat with its brilliant lights and its two streams of
traffic.</p>

<p><br>We were a conspicuous trio in our mean garments of rags
with which we had sought to disguise ourselves in Kormor, and
many were the suspicious glances cast in our direction.</p>

<p>As quickly as I could I hailed a public conveyance and
instructed the driver to take us to the home of Ero Shan, and as
we settled down upon the cushions we relaxed for the first time
in many a day.</p>

<p>We talked a great deal during the drive, particularly Nalte
and I. Duare was very quiet. She spoke of the beauty of Havatoo
and the wonders that surrounded us, all strange and new to her,
but only briefly and then lapsed into silence again.</p>

<p>Our driver had eyed us suspiciously when we entered his car,
and when he deposited us in front of the house of Ero Shan he
behaved peculiarly.</p>

<p>But Ero Shan was delighted to see us. He ordered food and
drink, and plied us with questions until he had had the whole
story from us several times. He congratulated me upon finding
Duare, but I could see that his greatest happiness lay in the
return of Nalte.</p>

<p>The girls were tired and needed rest, and we were preparing to
take them to Nalte's home when the first blow fell that was to
put the lives of two of us in jeopardy and plunge us all from the
heights of happiness to the depths of despair.</p>

<p>There was a summons at the main entrance, and presently a
servant entered the room. Behind him was a file of warriors
commanded by an officer.</p>

<p>Ero Shan looked up in surprise. He knew the officer and called
him by name, asking him what brought him here with armed men.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Ero Shan," the man replied, "but I have orders
from the Sanjong itself to arrest three suspicious appearing
people who were seen to enter your house earlier in the
evening."</p>

<p>"But," exclaimed Ero Shan, "no one has entered my house but
Carson Napier, whom you know, and these two young women. They are
all my friends."</p>

<p>The officer was eyeing our mean apparel and evidently not
without suspicion. "These must be those I was sent to arrest if
no one else has entered your house this evening," he said.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but accompany the warriors, and this
we did. Ero Shan came with us, and a short time later we were
before an investigating board of three men.</p>

<p>The complaining witness was the driver who had brought us from
the house that hid the entrance to the tunnel to Ero Shan's. He
said that he lived in the neighborhood, and having known of the
abduction of Nalte he was immediately suspicious when he saw
three people, garbed as we were, in the vicinity of the
place.</p>

<p>He accused us of being spies from Kormor and insisted that we
were but painted corpses like the man I had grappled with at the
time of the abduction of Nalte.</p>

<p>The examining board listened to my story; then they examined
Nalte and Duare briefly. They questioned Ero Shan concerning us,
and without leaving the room they discharged Nalte and myself and
ordered Duare back for a further examination by the official
examining board the following day.</p>

<p>I thought that they seemed a little suspicious of Duare; and
so did Ero Shan, though he only admitted this after we had
returned the girls to Nalte's home and were alone.</p>

<p>"Justice sometimes miscarries in Havatoo," he said gravely.
"The loathing that we feel for Kormor and everything connected
with it colors all our decisions in matters concerning it. Duare
admits having been in Kormor for some time. She admits having
resided in the palace of Skor, the jong. The examining board
knows nothing about her other than what she claims and what you
tell them, but they do not know that they can believe either of
you. You will recall that the result of your examination was not
such as to create considerable confidence in you."</p>

<p>"And you think that Duare may be in danger?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," he replied. "Everything may come out all
right; but, on the other hand, if the board has the slightest
suspicion concerning Duare it will order her destroyed, for our
theory of justice is that it is better to do an injustice to a
single individual than to risk the safety and welfare of many.
Sometimes that policy is a cruel one, but results have
demonstrated that it is better for the race than a policy of weak
sentimentalism."</p>

<p>I did not sleep well that night. The weight of a great fear
for the outcome of to-morrow's trial oppressed me.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19">XIX. &mdash; FLIGHT</a></h2>

<p class="first">I WAS not permitted to accompany Duare to her
examination. She was placed in charge of the same woman who had
guarded Nalte at the time of her examination, Hara Es.</p>

<p>To pass the hours until the result should be made known, I
went to the hangar to inspect my plane. It was in perfect
condition. The motor hummed almost noiselessly. I could not,
under ordinary circumstances, have withstood the urge to have the
ship wheeled out onto the plain before the city for a trial
flight; but my mind was so distraught with apprehension
concerning the fate of Duare that I had no heart for
anything.</p>

<p>I spent an hour alone in the hangar. None of my assistants was
there, they having all returned to their ordinary duties after
the completion of the plane. Then I returned to the house that I
shared with Ero Shan.</p>

<p>He was not there. I tried to read, but I could not concentrate
long enough to know what I was reading about. My eyes followed
the strange Amtorian characters, but my thoughts were with Duare.
At last I gave it up and walked in the garden. An unreasoning
terror enveloped me like a shroud, numbing my faculties.</p>

<p>How long I walked I do not know, but at last my sad reveries
were interrupted by the approach of footsteps through the house.
I knew that Ero Shan must be coming to the garden. I stood
waiting, looking toward the doorway through which he must come;
and the instant that I saw him my heart turned cold. I read the
confirmation of my worst fears in the expression on his face.</p>

<p>He came and laid a hand upon my shoulder. "I have bad news for
you, my friend," he said.</p>

<p>"I know," I replied; "I read it in your eyes. They have
ordered her destroyed?"</p>

<p>"It is a miscarriage of justice," he said, "but there is no
appeal. We must accept the decision as the board's honest
conviction that they are thus serving the best interests of the
city."</p>

<p>"Is there nothing I can do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he replied.</p>

<p>"Won't they let me take her away from Havatoo?"</p>

<p>"No; they are so afraid of the contaminating influence of Skor
and his creatures that they will never permit one to live that
falls into their hands."</p>

<p>"But she is not one of Skor's creatures!" I insisted.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure that they had their doubts, but the benefit
of the doubt is given to the city and not to the accused. There
is nothing more to be done."</p>

<p>"Do you think they would let me see her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is possible," he replied. "For some reason she is not to
be destroyed until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Will you try to arrange it for me, Ero Shan?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied. "Wait here, and I will see what I can
do."</p>

<p>I have never spent such long and bitter hours as those while I
was awaiting the return of Ero Shan. Never before had I felt so
helpless and hopeless in the face of an emergency. Had these been
ordinary men with whom I had to deal, I might have seen somewhere
a ray of hope, but there was none here. Their uprightness
precluded the possibility that I might influence even a minor
guard by bribery; they could not be moved by an appeal to
sentiment; the cold, hard logic of their reasoning left their
minds impregnable fortresses of conviction that it was useless to
assail.</p>

<p>I have said that I was hopeless, but that was not entirely
true. Upon what my hope fed I do not know, but it seemed so
impossible to believe that Duare was to be destroyed that my mind
must in some slight measure have been stunned.</p>

<p><br>It was dark before Ero Shan returned. I could read
neither hope nor despair in his expression as he entered the room
where I had finally gone to await him. He appeared very serious
and very tired.</p>

<p>"Well?" I demanded. "What is the verdict? Were you
successful?"</p>

<p>"I had a hard time of it," he said. "I had to go all the way
up to the Sanjong, but at last I got permission for you to visit
her."</p>

<p>"Where is she? When may I see her?"</p>

<p>"I will take you to her now," he replied.</p>

<p>After we entered his car I asked him how he had accomplished
it.</p>

<p>"I finally took Nalte with me," he replied. "She knew more
about you and all that you and Duare have passed through together
than any one else in Havatoo. For a while I almost thought that
she was going to persuade the Sanjong to reverse the verdict
against Duare, and it was solely through her appeal that they at
last gave their consent to this last meeting.</p>

<p>"I learned a great deal about you and Duare from Nalte, much
more than you have ever told me; and I learned something
else."</p>

<p>"What was that?" I asked as he paused.</p>

<p>"I learned that I love Nalte," he replied.</p>

<p>"And did you learn that she loves you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Were it not for your unhappiness I should be quite the
happiest man in Havatoo to-night. But what made you think that
Nalte loved me?"</p>

<p>"She told me so."</p>

<p>"And you did not tell me?" he asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I could not," I replied, "until after I knew that you loved
her."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. She told me that you were planning on taking
her back to Andoo; but now that won't be necessary&mdash;she
seems quite content to remain in Havatoo."</p>

<p>We had been driving along the Korgan Lat toward the stadium,
and now Ero Shan turned into a side street and stopped before a
small house.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said. "This is the house of Hara Es, in
whose charge Duare has been placed. Hara Es is expecting you. I
shall wait out here. You are to be allowed to remain with Duare
for five vir."</p>

<p>Five vir are a little over twenty minutes of earth time. It
seemed all too short, but it was better than nothing. I went to
the door of the house, and in answer to my summons Hara Es
admitted me.</p>

<p>"I have been expecting you," she said. "Come with me."</p>

<p>She led me up to the second floor and unlocking a door, pushed
it open. "Go in," she directed. "In five vir I shall come for
you."</p>

<p><br>As I entered the room Duare rose from a couch and faced
me. Hara Es closed the door and locked it. I heard her footsteps
as she descended the stairs. We were alone, Duare and I, for the
first time in what seemed an eternity.</p>

<p>"Why did you come here?" asked Duare in a tired voice.</p>

<p>"You ask me that!" I exclaimed. "You know why I came."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "You cannot do anything for me; no one
can. I supposed you would come if you could help me, but as you
can't, I do not know why you came."</p>

<p>"If for no other reason, because I love you. Is not that
reason enough?"</p>

<p>"Do not speak to me of love. I am about to die, but I am still the daughter of a jong of Vepaja."</p>

<p>Even in this last extremity Duare remained a victim of the
foolish restrictions imposed upon her by her royal blood, and I
determineddnot to make her last moments more unhappy by pressing unwelcome attentions upon her, although it was only with the
greatest difficulty that I refrained from taking her in my arms
and covering those beautiful lips with kisses.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid to die, Carson Napier," she said. "As it
seems impossible that, living, I should ever return to Vepaja, I
prefer to die. I am not happy. I can never be happy.  It is
better then that I die."</p>

<p>"Why could you never be happy?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"That is my secret; I shall take it to the grave with me. Let
us not speak of it any more."</p>

<p>"I don't wish you to die, Duare. You must not die!" I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I know that you feel that way, Carson, but what are we to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"There must be something we can do. How many are there in this
house besides Hara Es and yourself?"</p>

<p>"There is no one."</p>

<p>Suddenly a mad hope possessed me. I searched the room with my
eyes. It was bare of all except absolute necessities. I saw
nothing with which I might carry out my plan. Time was flying.
Hara Es would soon return. My eyes fell upon the saronglike scarf
that Duare wore, the common outer garment of Amtorian women.</p>

<p>"Let me take this," I said, stepping to her side.</p>

<p>"What for?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Do as I say! We have no time to argue."</p>

<p>Duare had long since learned to submerge her pride when my
tone told her that an emergency confronted us and to obey me
promptly. She did so now. Quickly she unwound the scarf from
about her and handed it to me.</p>

<p>"Here it is," she said. "What are you going to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see. Stand over there on the right side of the room.
Here comes Hara Es now; I hear her on the stairs."</p>

<p>I stepped quickly to one side of the door so that I should be
behind it and hidden from Hara Es as she entered. Then I waited.
More than my own life lay in the balance, yet I was not nervous.
My heart beat as quietly as though I were contemplating nothing
more exciting than a pleasant social visit.</p>

<p>I heard Hara Es stop before the door. I heard the key turn in
the lock. Then the door swung open and Hara Es stepped into the
room. As she did so I seized her by the throat from behind and
pushed the door shut with my foot.</p>

<p>"Don't make a sound," I warned, "or I shall have to kill
you."</p>

<p>She did not lose her poise for an instant. "You are very
foolish," she said. "This will not save Duare, and it will mean
your death. You cannot escape from Havatoo."</p>

<p>I made no reply, but worked quickly and in silence. I bound
her securely with the scarf and then gagged her. When I had
finished I raised her from the floor and placed her on the
couch.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Hara Es, for what I was compelled to do. I am
going now to get rid of Ero Shan. He will know nothing of what I
have done. Please be sure to inform the Sanjong that Ero Shan is
in no way responsible for what has happened&mdash;or what is
going to happen. I shall leave you here until I can get away from
Ero Shan without arousing his suspicions.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, Duare, watch Hara Es closely until I return.
See that she does not loosen her bonds."</p>

<p>I stooped and picked the key from the floor where Hara Es had
dropped it; then I quit the room, locking the door after me. A
moment later I was in the car with Ero Shan.</p>

<p>"Let's get home as quickly as possible," I said; then I lapsed
into silence, a silence which Ero Shan, respecting what he
thought to be my sorrow, did not break.</p>

<p>He drove rapidly, but it seemed an eternity before he steered
the car into the garage at the house. There being no thieves in
Havatoo, locks are unnecessary; so our garage doors stood wide
open as they always were except in inclement weather. My car,
facing toward the street, stood beside Ero Shan's </p>

<p>"You have eaten scarcely anything all day," said Ero Shan as
we entered the house; "suppose we have something now."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," I replied. "I am going to my room. I could not
eat now."</p>

<p>He laid a hand upon my arm and pressed it gently, but he did
not say anything; then he turned and left me. A wonderful friend
was Ero Shan. I hated to deceive him, but I would have deceived
my God to save Duare.</p>

<p>I went to my room, but only long enough to procure
weapons; then I returned to the garage. As I stepped into my car
I offered a prayer of thanks that the motors of Havatoo are
silent. Like a wraith the car slipped out of the garage into the
night, and as I passed the house I whispered a silent good-by to
Ero Shan.</p>

<p>Approaching the house of Hara Es I felt the first qualm of
nervousness that had assailed me during this adventure, but the
house seemed quite deserted as I entered it and ran up the stairs
to the second floor.</p>

<p>Unlocking the door of the room in which I had left Duare and
Hara Es, I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw them both there. I
crossed quickly to the couch and examined Hara Es's bonds. They
appeared quite secure.</p>

<p>"Come!" I said to Duare. "We have no time to waste."</p>

<p>She followed me out of the room. I locked the door on Hara Es,
found another sarong for Duare in a room on the first floor, and
a moment later Duare and I were in my car.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she asked. "We cannot hide in Havatoo.
They will find us."</p>

<p>"We are going to leave Havatoo forever," I replied, and just
then I saw a car pass us and draw up in front of the house we had
just left. Two men were in it; one of them jumped out and ran to
the door; then I opened the throttle. I had seen enough to turn
me cold with apprehension.</p>

<p>Duare had seen, too. "Now they will discover everything," she
said, "and you will be killed. I knew that it would end in
disaster. Oh, why didn't you let me die alone? I want to
die."</p>

<p>"But I won't let you!"</p>

<p>She said nothing more, and we sped through the now almost
deserted streets of Havatoo toward the Kantum Lat and the Gate of
the Physicists.</p>

<p>We had gone about two miles of the three that we must cover
before we reached our destination when I heard an ominous sound
such as I had never before heard in Havatoo. It sounded like the
wailing of sirens such as are used on police cars in the large
cities of America. Instantly I knew that it was an alarm, and I
guessed that the man who had entered the house of Hara Es had
discovered her and that our escape was known.</p>

<p>Closer and closer came the sounds of the wailing sirens as I
drew up before the hangar where my plane stood; they seemed to be
converging upon us from all directions. I was not surprised that
they should have guessed where they would find us, for it would
have been obvious to even duller minds than those of Havatoo that
here lay my only chance to escape.</p>

<p>Fairly dragging Duare with me, I leaped from the car and ran
into the hangar. The great doors, operated by mechanical means,
rolled open at the touch of a button. I lifted Duare into the
cockpit. She asked no questions; there was no time for
questions.</p>

<p>Then I took my place at her side. I had designed the plane for
training purposes; and it had two seats, each accommodating two
people. I started the motor&mdash;and such a motor! Silent,
vibrationless, and it required no warming up.</p>

<p>I taxied out into the Kantum Lat. The sirens were very close
now. I saw the lights of cars bearing down upon us. As I started
toward the Gate of the Physicists I heard the staccato hum of
Amtorian rifles behind us. They were firing at us!</p>

<p>I nosed up; the wheels left the ground; the great gate loomed
directly ahead. Up! Faster! Faster! I held my breath. Would we
make it? Responding perfectly, the light ship climbed almost
vertically in the last few seconds; she sped over the top of the
lofty gate with only inches to spare. We were safe!</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20">CONCLUSION</a></h2>

<p class="first">FAR below, the lights of Havatoo lay behind us
as I turned the ship's nose toward the shimmering ribbon that was
the River of Death&mdash;the River of Life to us&mdash;that was
to guide us down to that unknown sea where, I was confident, we
would find Vepaja.</p>

<p>Duare had not spoken. I felt her arm against mine trembling. I
reached over and laid a hand upon it. "Why are you trembling?" I
asked. "You are quite safe now."</p>

<p>"What is this thing we are in?" she asked. "Why does it not
fall to the ground and kill us? What keeps it up?"</p>

<p>I explained as best I could, telling her that there was no
danger that it would fall; and then she drew a deep, long sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>"If you say that we are safe; then I am afraid no longer," she
said. "But tell me, why are you making this sacrifice for
me?"</p>

<p>"What sacrifice?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You can never return to Havatoo now; they would kill
you."</p>

<p>"I do not want to return to Havatoo if you cannot live there
in safety," I replied.</p>

<p>"But what of Nalte?" she asked. "You love one another, and now
you can never see her again."</p>

<p>"I do not love Nalte, nor does she love me. I love only you,
Duare; and Nalte and Ero Shan love one another."</p>

<p>She sat in silence for a long time; then, presently, she
turned and looked up into my face. "Carson!" she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Duare, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I love you!"</p>

<p>I could not believe that I had heard aright. "But, Duare, you
are the daughter of a jong of Vepaja!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That I have known always," she said, "but I have just learned
that above all things else I am a woman."</p>

<p>I took her in my arms then. I could have held her thus
forever, but I had to release her a moment later to right the
ship as it went into a tail spin. </p>
