<p> </p>

<p>In providing a historical play for the Malvern Festival of 1939 I
departed from the established practice sufficiently to require a word
of explanation. The "histories" of Shakespear are chronicles
dramatized; and my own chief historical plays, Caesar and Cleopatra and
St Joan, are fully documented chronicle plays of this type. Familiarity
with them would get a student safely through examination papers on
their periods.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>STAGE CHAPTERS OF HISTORY</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A much commoner theatrical product is the historical romance, mostly
fiction with historical names attached to the stock characters of the
stage. Many of these plays have introduced their heroines as Nell
Gwynn, and Nell's principal lover as Charles II. As Nell was a lively
and lovable actress, it was easy to reproduce her by casting a lively
and lovable actress for the part; but the stage Charles, though his
costume and wig were always unmistakeable, never had any other
resemblance to the real Charles, nor to anything else on earth except
what he was not: a stage walking gentleman with nothing particular to
say for himself.</p>

<p>Now the facts of Charles's reign have been chronicled so often by
modern historians of all parties, from the Whig Macaulay to the
Jacobite Hilaire Belloc, that there is no novelty left for the
chronicler to put on the stage. As to the romance, it is intolerably
stale: the spectacle of a Charles sitting with his arm round Nell
Gwynn's waist, or with Moll Davis seated on his knee, with the
voluptuous termagant Castlemaine raging in the background, has no
interest for me, if it ever had for any grown-up person.</p>

<p>But when we turn from the sordid facts of Charles's reign, and from
his Solomonic polygamy, to what might have happened to him but did not,
the situation becomes interesting and fresh. For instance, Charles
might have met that human prodigy Isaac Newton. And Newton might have
met that prodigy of another sort, George Fox, the founder of the
morally mighty Society of Friends, vulgarly called the Quakers. Better
again, all three might have met. Now anyone who considers a hundred and
fiftieth edition of Sweet Nell of Old Drury more attractive than Isaac
Newton had better avoid my plays: they are not meant for such. And
anyone who is more interested in Lady Castlemaine's hips than in Fox's
foundation of the great Cult of Friendship should keep away from
theatres and frequent worse places. Still, though the interest of my
play lies mainly in the clash of Charles, George, and Isaac, there is
some fun in the clash between all three and Nelly, Castlemaine, and the
Frenchwoman Louise de K&eacute;roualle, whom we called Madame Carwell.
So I bring the three on the stage to relieve the intellectual
tension.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>NEWTON'S RECTILINEAR UNIVERSE</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There is another clash which is important and topical in view of the
hold that professional science has gained on popular credulity since
the middle of the nineteenth century. I mean the eternal clash between
the artist and the physicist. I have therefore invented a collision
between Newton and a personage whom I should like to have called
Hogarth; for it was Hogarth who said "the line of beauty is a curve,"
and Newton whose first dogma it was that the universe is in principle
rectilinear. He called straight lines right lines; and they were still
so called in my school Euclid eighty years ago. But Hogarth could not
by any magic be fitted into the year 1680, my chosen date; so I had to
fall back on Godfrey Kneller. Kneller had not Hogarth's brains; but I
have had to endow him with them to provide Newton with a victorious
antagonist. In point of date Kneller just fitted in.</p>

<p>But I must make an exception to this general invitation. If by any
chance you are a great mathematician or astronomer you had perhaps
better stay away. I have made Newton aware of something wrong with the
perihelion of Mercury. Not since Shakespear made Hector of Troy quote
Aristotle has the stage perpetrated a more staggering anachronism. But
I find the perihelion of Mercury so irresistible as a laugh catcher
(like Weston-super-Mare) that I cannot bring myself to sacrifice it. I
am actually prepared to defend it as a possibility. Newton was not only
a lightning calculator with a monstrous memory: he was also a most
ingenious and dexterous maker of apparatus. He made his own telescope;
and when he wanted to look at Mercury without being dazzled by the sun
he was quite clever enough to produce an artificial eclipse by putting
an obturator into the telescope, though nobody else hit on that simple
device until long after. My ignorance in these matters is stupendous;
but I refuse to believe that Newton's system did not enable him to
locate Mercury theoretically at its nearest point to the sun, and then
to find out with his telescope that it was apparently somewhere
else.</p>

<p>For the flash of prevision in which Newton foresees Einstein's
curvilinear universe I make no apology. Newton's first law of motion is
pure dogma. So is Hogarth's first law of design. The modern astronomers
have proved, so far, that Hogarth was right and Newton wrong. But as
the march of science during my long lifetime has played skittles with
all the theories in turn I dare not say how the case will stand by the
time this play of mine reaches its thousandth performance (if it ever
does). Meanwhile let me admit that Newton in my play is a stage
astronomer: that is, an astronomer not for an age but for all time.
Newton as a man was the queerest of the prodigies; and I have chapter
and verse for all his contradictions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHARLES'S GOLDEN DAYS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As to Charles, he adolesced as a princely cosmopolitan vagabond of
curiously mixed blood, and ended as the first king in England whose
kingship was purely symbolic, and who was clever enough to know that
the work of the regicides could not be undone, and that he had to reign
by his wits and not by the little real power they had left him.
Unfortunately the vulgarity of his reputation as a Solomonic polygamist
has not only obscured his political ability, but eclipsed the fact that
he was the best of husbands. Catherine of Braganza, his wife, has been
made to appear a nobody, and Castlemaine, his concubine, almost a great
historical figure. When you have seen my play you will not make that
mistake, and may therefore congratulate yourself on assisting at an act
of historical justice.</p>

<p>Let us therefore drop the popular subject of The Merry Monarch and
his women. On the stage, and indeed off it, he is represented as having
practically no other interest, and being a disgracefully unfaithful
husband. It is inferred that he was politically influenced by women,
especially by Louise de K&eacute;roualle, who, as an agent of Louis
XIV, kept him under the thumb of that Sun of Monarchs as his secret
pensioner. The truth is that Charles, like most English kings, was
continually in money difficulties because the English people, having an
insuperable dislike of being governed at all, would not pay taxes
enough to finance an efficient civil and military public service. In
Charles's day especially they objected furiously to a standing army,
having had enough of that under Cromwell, and grudged their king even
the lifeguards which were the nucleus of such an army. Charles, to
carry on, had to raise the necessary money somewhere; and as he could
not get it from the Protestant people of England he was clever enough
to get it from the Catholic king of France; for, though head of the
Church of England, he privately ranked Protestants as an upstart vulgar
middle-class sect, and the Catholic Church as the authentic original
Church of Christ, and the only possible faith for a gentleman. In
achieving this he made use of Louise: there is no evidence that she
made use of him. To the Whig historians the transaction makes Charles a
Quisling in the service of Louis and a traitor to his own country. This
is mere Protestant scurrility: the only shady part of it is that
Charles, spending the money in the service of England, gave <i>le Roi
Soleil</i> no value for it.</p>

<p>The other mistresses could make him do nothing that his goodnature
did not dispose him to do, whether it was building Greenwich Hospital
or making dukes of his bastards. As a husband he took his marriage very
seriously, and his sex adventures as calls of nature on an entirely
different footing. In this he was in the line of evolution, which leads
to an increasing separation of the unique and intensely personal and
permanent marriage relation from the carnal intercourse described in
Shakespear's sonnet. This, being a response to the biological decree
that the world must be peopled, may arise irresistibly between persons
who could not live together endurably for a week but can produce
excellent children. Historians who confuse Charles's feelings for his
wife with his appetite for Barbara Villiers do not know chalk from
cheese biologically.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE FUTURE OF WOMEN IN POLITICS</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The establishment of representative government in England is assumed
to have been completed by the enfranchisement of women in 1928. The
enormous hiatus left by their previous disenfranchisement is supposed
to have been filled up and finished with. As a matter of fact it has
only reduced Votes for Women to absurdity; for the women immediately
used their vote to keep women out of Parliament. After seventeen years
of it the nation, consisting of men and women in virtually equal
numbers, is misrepresented at Westminster by 24 women and 616 men.
During the Suffragette revolt of 1913 I gave great offence to the
agitators by forecasting this result, and urging that what was needed
was not the vote, but a constitutional amendment enacting that all
representative bodies shall consist of women and men in equal numbers,
whether elected or nominated or co-opted or registered or picked up in
the street like a coroner's jury.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE COUPLED VOTE</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the case of elected bodies the only way of effecting this is by
the Coupled Vote. The representative unit must be not a man <i>or</i> a
woman but a man <i>and</i> a woman. Every vote, to be valid, must be
for a human pair, with the result that the elected body must consist of
men and women in equal numbers. Until this is achieved it is idle to
prate about political democracy as existing, or ever having existed, at
any known period of English history.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the half-and-half proportion is valid no
matter what the proportion of women to men is in the population. It
never varies considerably; but even if it did the natural unit would
still be the complete couple and not its better (or worse) half.</p>

<p>The wisdom or expediency of this reform is questioned on various
grounds. There are the people who believe that the soul is a masculine
organ lacking in women, as certain physical organs are, and is the seat
of male political faculty. But, so far, dissection, spectrum analysis,
the electronic microscope, have failed to discover in either sex any
specific organ or hormone that a biologist can label as the soul. So we
christen it The Holy Ghost or The Lord of Hosts and dechristen it as a
Life Force or <i>&Eacute;lan Vital.</i> As this is shared by women and
men, and, when it quits the individual, produces in both alike the
dissolution we call death, democratic representation cannot be said to
exist where women are not as fully enfranchised and qualified as men.
So far no great harm has been done by their legal disabilities because
men and women are so alike that for the purposes of our crude
legislation it matters little whether juries and parliaments are packed
with men or women; but now that the activities of government have been
greatly extended, detailed criticism by women has become indispensable
in Cabinets. For instance, the House of Lords is more representative
than the House of Commons because its members are there as the sons of
their fathers, which is the reason for all of us being in the world;
but it would be a much more human body if it were half-and-half sons
and daughters.</p>

<p>All this went on with the approval of the women, who formed half the
community, and yet were excluded not only from the franchise but from
the professions and public services, except the thrones. Up to a point
this also did not matter much; for in oligarchies women exercise so
much influence privately and irresponsibly that the cleverest of them
are for giving all power to the men, knowing that they can get round
them without being hampered by the female majority whose world is the
kitchen, the nursery, and the drawingroom if such a luxury is within
their reach.</p>

<p>But representation on merely plangent Parliamentary bodies is not
sufficient. Anybody can complain of a grievance; but its remedy demands
constructive political capacity. Now political capacity is rare; but it
is not rarer in women than in men. Nature's supply of five per cent or
so of born political thinkers and administrators are all urgently
needed in modern civilization; and if half of that natural supply is
cut off by the exclusion of women from Parliament and Cabinets the
social machinery will fall short and perhaps break down for lack of
sufficient direction. Competent women, of whom enough are available,
have their proper places filled by incompetent men: there is no Cabinet
in Europe that would not be vitally improved by having its male tail
cut off and female heads substituted.</p>

<p>But how is this to be done? Giving all women the vote makes it
impossible because it only doubles the resistance to any change. When
it was introduced in England not a single woman was returned at the
ensuing General Election, though there were women of proved ability in
the field. They were all defeated by male candidates who were
comparative noodles and nobodies.</p>

<p>Therefore I suggest and advocate The Coupled Vote, making all votes
invalid except those for a bi-sexed couple, and thus ensuring the
return of a body in which men and women are present in equal numbers.
Until this is done, adult suffrage will remain the least democratic of
all political systems. I leave it to our old parliamentary hands to
devise a plan by which our electorate can be side-tracked, humbugged,
cheated, lied to, or frightened into tolerating such a change. If it
has to wait for their enlightenment it will wait too long.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The library in the house of Isaac Newton in Cambridge in the year
1680. It is a cheerful room overlooking the garden from the first floor
through a large window which has an iron balcony outside, with an iron
staircase down to the garden level. The division of the window to the
left as you look out through it is a glass door leading to these
stairs, making the room accessible from the garden. Inside the room the
walls are lined with cupboards below and bookshelves above. To the
right of the window is a stand-up writing desk. The cupboards are
further obstructed by six chairs ranged tidily along them, three to the
right of the window and three to the left (as you look out). Between
them a table belonging to the set of chairs stands out in the middle
with writing materials on it and a prodigious open Bible, made for a
church lectern. A comfortable chair for the reader faces away from the
window. On the reader's left is a handsome armchair, apparently for the
accommodation of distinguished visitors to the philosopher.</i></p>

<p><i>Newton's housekeeper, a middle aged woman of very respectable
appearance, is standing at the desk working at her accounts.</i></p>

<p><i>A serving maid in morning deshabille comes in through the
interior door, which is in the side wall to the left of the window
(again as you look out through it).</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>THE MAID. Please, Mrs Basham, a Mr Rowley wants to know when the
master will be at home to receive him.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Rowley? I dont know him. This is no hour to call on Mr
Newton.</p>

<p>THE MAID. No indeed, maam. And look at me! not dressed to open the
door to gentlefolk.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Is he a gentleman? Rowley is not much of a name.</p>

<p>THE MAID. Dressed like a nobleman, maam. Very tall and very dark.
And a lot of dogs with him, and a lackey. Not a person you could shut
the door in the face of, maam. But very condescending, I must say.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Well, tell him to come back at half past eleven; but I
can't promise that Mr Newton will be in. Still, if he likes to come on
the chance. And without his dogs, mind. Our Diamond would fight with
them.</p>

<p>THE MAID. Yes, maam: I'll tell him <i>[going].</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Oh, Sally, can you tell me how much is three times
seven. You were at school, werent you?</p>

<p>SALLY. Yes, maam; but they taught the boys to read, write, and
cipher. Us girls were only taught to sew.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Well, never mind. I will ask Mr Newton. He'll know, if
anybody will. Or stop. Ask Jack the fish hawker. He's paunching the
rabbit in the kitchen.</p>

<p>SALLY. Yes, maam. <i>[She goes].</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Three sixpences make one and sixpence and three
eightpences make two shillings: they always do. But three sevenpences!
I give it up.</p>

<p><i>Sally returns.</i></p>

<p>SALLY. Please, maam, another gentleman wants Mr Newton.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Another nobleman?</p>

<p>SALLY. No, maam. He wears leather clothes. Quite out of the
common.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Did he give his name?</p>

<p>SALLY. George Fox, he said, maam.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Why, thats the Quaker, the Man in Leather Breeches. He's
been in prison. How dare he come here wanting to see Mr Newton? Go and
tell him that Mr Newton is not at home to the like of him.</p>

<p>SALLY. Oh, he's not a person I could talk to like that, maam. I
dursnt.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Are you frightened of a man that would call a church a
steeple house and walk into it without taking off his hat? Go this
instant and tell him you will raise the street against him if he
doesn&rsquo;t go away. Do you hear. Go and do as I tell you.</p>

<p>SALLY. I'd be afraid he'd raise the street against us. I will do my
best to get rid of him without offence. <i>[She goes].</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM <i>[calling after her]</i> And mind you ask Jack how much
three times seven is.</p>

<p>SALLY <i>[outside]</i> Yes'm.</p>

<p><i>Newton, aged 38, comes in from the garden, hatless, deep in
calculation, his fists clenched, tapping his knuckles together to tick
off the stages of the equation. He stumbles over the mat.</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Oh, do look where youre going, Mr Newton. Someday youll
walk into the river and drown yourself. I thought you were out at the
university.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Now dont scold, Mrs Basham, dont scold. I forgot to go out.
I thought of a way of making a calculation that has been puzzling
me.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. And you have been sitting out there forgetting
everything else since breakfast. However, since you have one of your
calculating fits on I wonder would you mind doing a little sum for me
to check the washing bill. How much is three times seven?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Three times seven? Oh, that is quite easy.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. I suppose it is to you, sir; but it beats me. At school
I got as far as addition and subtraction; but I never could do
multiplication or division.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Why, neither could I: I was too lazy. But they are quite
unnecessary: addition and subtraction are quite sufficient. You add the
logarithms of the numbers; and the antilogarithm of the sum of the two
is the answer. Let me see: three times seven? The logarithm of three
must be decimal four seven seven or thereabouts. The logarithm of seven
is, say, decimal eight four five. That makes one decimal three two two,
doesnt it? What's the antilogarithm of one decimal three two two? Well,
it must be less than twentytwo and more than twenty. You will be safe
if you put it down as--</p>

<p><i>Sally returns.</i></p>

<p>SALLY. Please, maam, Jack says it's twentyone.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Extraordinary! Here was I blundering over this simple
problem for a whole minute; and this uneducated fish hawker solves it
in a flash! He is a better mathematician than I.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. This is our new maid from Woolsthorp, Mr Newton. You
havnt seen her before.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Havnt I? I didnt notice it. <i>[To Sally]</i> Youre from
Woolsthorp, are you? So am I. How old are you?</p>

<p>SALLY. Twentyfour, sir.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Twentyfour years. Eight thousand seven hundred and sixty
days. Two hundred and ten thousand two hundred and forty hours. Twelve
million six hundred and fourteen thousand, four hundred minutes. Seven
hundred and fiftysix million eight hundred and sixtyfour thousand
seconds. A long long life.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Come now, Mr Newton: you will turn the child's head with
your figures. What can one do in a second?</p>

<p>NEWTON. You can do, quite deliberately and intentionally, seven
distinct actions in a second. How do you count seconds?
Hackertybackertyone, hackertybackertytwo, hackertybackertythree and so
on. You pronounce seven syllables in every second. Think of it! This
young woman has had time to perform more than five thousand millions of
considered and intentional actions in her lifetime. How many of them
can you remember, Sally?</p>

<p>SALLY. Oh sir, the only one I can remember was on my sixth birthday.
My father gave me sixpence: a penny for every year.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Six from twentyfour is eighteen. He owes you one and
sixpence. Remind me to give you one and sevenpence on your next
birthday if you are a good girl. Now be off.</p>

<p>SALLY. Oh, thank you, sir. <i>[She goes out].</i></p>

<p>NEWTON. My father, who died before I was born, was a wild,
extravagant, weak man: so they tell me. I inherit his wildness, his
extravagance, his weakness, in the shape of a craze for figures of
which I am most heartily ashamed. There are so many more important
things to be worked at: the transmutations of matter, the elixir of
life, the magic of light and color, above all, the secret meaning of
the Scriptures. And when I should be concentrating my mind on these I
find myself wandering off into idle games of speculation about numbers
in infinite series, and dividing curves into indivisibly short triangle
bases. How silly! What a waste of time, priceless time!</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. There is a Mr Rowley going to call on you at half past
eleven.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Can I never be left alone? Who is Mr Rowley? What is Mr
Rowley?</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Dressed like a nobleman. Very tall. Very dark. Keeps a
lackey. Has a pack of dogs with him.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Oho! So that is who he is! They told me he wanted to see my
telescope. Well, Mrs Basham, he is a person whose visit will be counted
a great honor to us. But I must warn you that just as I have my
terrible weakness for figures Mr Rowley has a very similar weakness for
women; so you must keep Sally out of his way.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Indeed! If he tries any of his tricks on Sally I shall
see that he marries her.</p>

<p>NEWTON. He is married already. <i>[He sits at the table].</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Oh! That sort of man! The beast!</p>

<p>NEWTON. Shshsh! Not a word against him, on your life. He is
privileged.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. He is a beast all the same!</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[opening the Bible]</i> One of the beasts in the Book of
Revelation, perhaps. But not a common beast.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Fox the Quaker, in his leather breeches had the
impudence to call.</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[interested]</i> George Fox? If he calls again I will see
him. Those two men ought to meet.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Those two men indeed! The honor of meeting you ought to
be enough for them, I should think.</p>

<p>NEWTON. The honor of meeting me! Dont talk nonsense. They are great
men in their very different ranks. I am nobody.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. You are the greatest man alive, sir. Mr Halley told me
so.</p>

<p>NEWTON. It was very wrong of Mr Halley to tell you anything of the
sort. You must not mind what he says. He is always pestering me to
publish my methods of calculation and to abandon my serious studies.
Numbers! Numbers! Numbers! Sines, cosines, hypotenuses, fluxions,
curves small enough to count as straight lines, distances between two
points that are in the same place! Are these philosophy? Can they make
a man great?</p>

<p><i>He is interrupted by Sally, who throws open the door and
announces visitors.</i></p>

<p>SALLY. Mr Rowley and Mr Fox.</p>

<p><i>King Charles the Second, aged 50, appears at the door, but makes
way for George Fox the Quaker, a big man with bright eyes and a
powerful voice in reserve, aged 56. He is decently dressed; but his
garments are made of leather.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. After you, Mr Fox. The spiritual powers before the
temporal.</p>

<p>FOX. You are very civil, sir; and you speak very justly. I thank you
<i>[he passes in].</i></p>

<p><i>Sally, intensely impressed by Mr Rowley, goes out.</i></p>

<p>FOX. Am I addressing the philosopher Isaac Newton?</p>

<p>NEWTON. You are, sir. <i>[Rising]</i> Will your noble friend do me
the honor to be seated in my humble dwelling?</p>

<p><i>Charles bows and takes the armchair with easy grace.</i></p>

<p>FOX. I must not impose on you by claiming the gentleman as my
friend. We met by chance at your door; and his favorite dog was kind
enough to take a fancy to me.</p>

<p>CHARLES. She is never mistaken, sir. Her friends are my friends, if
so damaged a character as mine can claim any friends.</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[taking a chair from the wall and placing it near his
table to his left]</i> Be seated, Mr Fox, pray.</p>

<p>FOX. George Fox at your service, not Mister. But I am very sensible
of your civility. <i>[He sits].</i></p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[resuming his seat at the table]</i> It seems that it is I
who am at your service. In what way can I oblige you?</p>

<p>FOX. As you remind me, I have come here uninvited. My business will
keep while you discharge yours with this nobleman--so called.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I also am uninvited, Pastor. I may address you so both
truthfully and civilly, may I not?</p>

<p>FOX. You have found the right word. I tended my father's sheep when
I was a child. Now I am a pastor of men's souls.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Good. Well, Pastor, I must inform you I have no business
here except to waste our host's invaluable time and to improve my own,
if he will be good enough to allow me such a liberty. Proceed then with
your business; and take no notice of me. Unless, that is, you would
prefer me to withdraw.</p>

<p>FOX. I have no business in this world that all men may not hear: the
more the better.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I guessed as much; and confess to an unbounded curiosity to
hear what George Fox can have to say to Isaac Newton. It is not
altogether an impertinent curiosity. My trade, which is a very unusual
one, requires that I should know what Tom, Dick and Harry have to say
to oneanother. I find you two gentlemen much more interesting and
infinitely more important.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM <i>[posted behind Newton's chair]</i> What is your
business, Mr Rowley? Mr Newton has much to do this morning. He has no
time for idle conversation.</p>

<p>NEWTON. I had forgotten to make this lady known to you, gentlemen.
Mrs Basham: my housekeeper, and the faithful guardian of my hours.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Your servant, Mistress Basham.</p>

<p>FOX. God be with you, woman.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Mr Rowley is a gentleman of great consequence, Mrs Basham.
He must not be questioned as if he were Jack the fish hawker. His
business is his lather's business.</p>

<p>CHARLES. No, no. My father's business is abolished in England: he
was executed for practising it. But we keep the old signboard up over
the door of the old shop. And I stand at the shop door in my father's
apron. Mrs Basham may ask me as many questions as she pleases; for I am
far less important now in England than Jack the fish hawker.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. But how do you live, sir? That is all I meant to
ask.</p>

<p>CHARLES. By my wits, Mistress Basham: by my wits. Come, Pastor:
enough of me. You are face to face with Isaac Newton. I long to hear
what you have to say to him.</p>

<p>FOX. Isaac Newton: I have friends who belong to the new so-called
Royal Society which the King has established, to enquire, it seems,
into the nature of the universe. They tell me things that my mind
cannot reconcile with the word of God as revealed to us in the Holy
Scriptures.</p>

<p>NEWTON. What is your warrant for supposing that revelation ceased
when King James's printers finished with the Bible?</p>

<p>FOX. I do not suppose so. I am not one of those priestridden
churchmen who believe that God went out of business six thousand years
ago when he had called the world into existence and written his book
about it. We three sitting here together may have a revelation if we
open our hearts and minds to it. Yes: even to you, Charles Stuart.</p>

<p>CHARLES: The mind of Charles Stuart is only too open, Pastor.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. What did you call the gentleman, Mr Fox?</p>

<p>CHARLES. A slip of the tongue, Mistress Basham. Nowhere in Holy
writ, Pastor, will you find any disapproval of Paul when he changed his
name from Saul. Need you be more scrupulous than the apostles?</p>

<p>FOX. It is against my sinful nature to disoblige any man; so Mr
Rowley you shall be if you so desire. But I owed it to you to let you
know that I was not deceived by your new name.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I thank you, Pastor. Your sinful nature makes you the best
mannered man in the kingdom. And now, what about the revelations?</p>

<p>FOX. I am troubled. I cannot conceive that God should contradict
himself. How must the revelation of today be received if it be contrary
to the revelation of yesterday? If what has been revealed to you, Isaac
Newton, be true, there is no heaven above us and no hell beneath us.
The sun which stood still upon Gibeon and the moon in the Valley of
Ajalon had stood still since the creation of the world.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Do not let that trouble you, Pastor. Nothing has ever stood
still for an instant since the creation of the world: neither the sun,
the moon, the stars, nor the smallest particle of matter, except on two
occasions.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Two! I remember only one.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Yes, sir: two. The first was when the sun stood still on
Gibeon to give Joshua time to slaughter the Amorites. The second was
when the shadow on the dial of Ahaz went ten degrees backward as a sign
from God to good King Hezekiah who was dying of a boil until the
prophet Isaiah made them put a lump of figs on it.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. There is nothing like a poultice of roasted figs to cure
a gumboil. And to think that is because it is in the Holy Bible! I
never knew it.</p>

<p>NEWTON. On reflection, the sun has stopped three times; for it must
have stopped for an infinitesimal moment when it turned back, and again
when it resumed its course.</p>

<p>FOX. I thank God that you are not an unbeliever and would not make
me one.</p>

<p>NEWTON. My good friend, there is nothing so wonderful that a
philosopher cannot believe it. The philosopher sees a hundred miracles
a day where the ignorant and thoughtless see nothing but the daily
round, the common task. Joshua was an ignorant soldier. Had he been a
philosopher he would have known that to stop the nearest speck of dust
would have served his turn as well as to stop the sun and moon; for it
could not have stopped without stopping the whole machinery of the
heavens. By the way, Mrs Basham, the fact that the sun and moon were
visible at the same time may help me to fix the day on which the
miracle occurred. <i>[To the others]</i> Excuse me, gentlemen: I have
written a chronological history of the world; and the dates give me
some trouble.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Did not the late Archbishop Ussher fix the dates of
everything that ever happened?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Unfortunately he did not allow for the precession of the
equinoxes. I had to correct some of his results accordingly.</p>

<p>CHARLES. And, saving the pastor's presence, what the divvle is the
precession of the equinoxes?</p>

<p>FOX. I am sinful enough to be glad that you are as ignorant as
myself. I suffer greatly from shame at my ignorance.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Shame will not help you, Pastor. I spend my life
contemplating the ocean of my ignorance. I once boasted of having
picked up a pebble on the endless beach of that ocean. I should have
said a grain of sand.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I can well believe it. No man confronted with the enormity
of what he does not know can think much of what he does know. But what
is the precession of the equinoxes? If I fire off those words at court
the entire peerage will be prostrate before the profundity of my
learning.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Oh, tell the gentlemen, Mr Newton; or they will be here
all day.</p>

<p>NEWTON. It is quite simple: a child can understand it. The two days
in the year on which the day and night are of equal duration are the
equinoxes. In each successive sidereal year they occur earlier. You
will see at once that this involves a retrograde motion of the
equinoctial points along the ecliptic. We call that the precession of
the equinoxes.</p>

<p>FOX. I thank you, Isaac Newton. I am as wise as I was before.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mr Newton, injuring
the poor gentlemen's brains with such outlandish words. You must
remember that everybody is not as learned as you are.</p>

<p>NEWTON. But surely it is plain to everybody--</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. No: it isnt plain to anybody, Mr Newton.</p>

<p>SALLY <i>[bursting in]</i> Mr Rowley: theres a lady in a coach at
the door wants to know are you ready to take a drive with her.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Any name?</p>

<p>SALLY. No, sir. She said youd know.</p>

<p>CHARLES. A duchess, would you say?</p>

<p>SALLY. Oh no, sir. Spoke to me quite familiar.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Nelly! Mr Newton: would you like to be introduced to
Mistress Gwynn, the famous Drury Lane actress?</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM <i>[turning imperatively to Charles]</i> Oh, I couldnt
allow that, Mr Rowley. I am surprised at you mentioning such a person
in my presence.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I apologize. I did not know that you disapproved of the
playhouse, Mrs Basham.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. I do not disapprove of the playhouse, sir. My
grandfather, who is still alive and hearty, was befriended in his youth
by Mr William Shakespear, a wellknown player and writer of comedies,
tragedies, and the like. Mr Shakespear would have died of shame to see
a woman on the stage. It is unnatural and wrong. Only the most
abandoned females would do such a thing.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Still, the plays are more natural with real women in them,
are they not?</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Indeed they are not, Mr Rowley. They are not like women
at all. They are just like what they are; and they spoil the play for
anyone who can remember the old actors in the women's parts. They could
make you believe you were listening to real women.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Pastor Fox: have you ever spoken with a female player?</p>

<p>FOX <i>[shuddering]</i> I! No, sir: I do not frequent such
company.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Why not, Pastor? Is your charity so narrow? Nell is no
worse than Mary Magdalen.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. I hope Mary Magdalen made a good end and was forgiven;
though we are nowhere told so. But I should not have asked her into my
house. And at least she was not on the stage. <i>[She retires behind
Newton's chair].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. What do you say, Pastor? Is Nelly not good enough for
you?</p>

<p>FOX. Sir: there is nobody who is not good enough for me. Have I not
warned our Christian friends who are now captives in Barbary not to
forget that the life of God and the power of God are in their heathen
masters the Turks and the Moors as well as in themselves? Is it any the
less in this player woman than in a Turk or a Moor? I am not afraid of
her.</p>

<p>CHARLES. And you, Mr Newton?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Women enter a philosopher's life only to disturb it. They
expect too much attention. However, Mistress Gwynn has called to take
you away, not to interrupt my work on fluxions. And if you will
condescend to go down to her she need not come up to us. <i>[He rises
in dismissal of the King].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[rising]</i> I see I must take my leave.</p>

<p><i>Nelly dashes in. Sally withdraws.</i></p>

<p>NELLY. Rowley darling: how long more are you going to keep me
waiting in the street?</p>

<p>CHARLES. You are known to everyone present, Mistress Gwynn, I think.
May I make our host known to you? The eminent philosopher, Mr
Newton.</p>

<p>NELLY <i>[going past Charles to Newton]</i> I dont know what a
philosopher is, Mr Newton; but you look one, every inch. Your servant,
sir. <i>[She curtsies to him].</i></p>

<p>NEWTON. Yours, madam. I am ashamed that you should have been kept
waiting at the wrong side of my door.</p>

<p>NELLY. It is an honor to be seen at your door, Mr Newton.
<i>[Looking round her]</i> And who keeps your house so beautifully? I
thought philosophers were like Romish priests, not allowed to
marry.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Is my house beautifully kept? I have never noticed it. This
is Mrs Basham, my housekeeper. <i>[He sits resignedly].</i></p>

<p>NELLY. You never noticed it! You dont deserve such a housekeeper.
Your servant, Mrs Basham.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Basham bows stiffly, trying not to be flattered.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. The other gentleman is the famous founder of the sect of
Quakers.</p>

<p>FOX. Of Friends, Friend Rowley.</p>

<p>NELLY <i>[running to Fox].</i> I know. I know. The man in the
leather breeches.</p>

<p>FOX <i>[stubbornly seated]</i> I am also known as George Fox.</p>

<p>NELLY <i>[clapping him on the shoulder]</i> What of that? Anybody
might be George Fox; but there is only one man in the leather breeches.
Your servant, George.</p>

<p>FOX. Yours, Nelly.</p>

<p>NELLY. There! Nelly! <i>[She goes to the wall for a chair and plants
it at Fox's left, quite close].</i> If I may add you to the list of my
beaus I shall be the proudest woman in London.</p>

<p>FOX. I did not found the order of beaus. I founded that of
Friends.</p>

<p>NELLY. Ten times better. Our beaus are our foes: they care for
nothing but to steal our honor. Pray for me, Friend Fox: I think you
have God by the ear closer than the bishops.</p>

<p>FOX. He is closer to you than you have placed yourself to me. Let no
priest come between you.</p>

<p>CHARLES. We must not waste any more of Mr Newton's time, Mistress
Gwynn. He is at work on fluxions.</p>

<p>NELLY. On what?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Fluxions I think you said, Mr Newton.</p>

<p>NELLY. What are fluxions?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Mr Newton will tell you. I should be glad to know,
myself.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Fluxions, madam, are the rates of change of continuously
varying quantities.</p>

<p>NELLY. I must go home and think about that, Mr Philosopher.</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[very seriously]</i> I shall be much indebted to you,
madam, if you will communicate to me the result of your reflections.
The truth is, I am not quite satisfied that my method--or perhaps I had
better say the notation of my method--is the easiest that can be
devised. On that account I have never cared to publish it.</p>

<p>NELLY. You really think I could teach you something, Mr Newton? What
a compliment! Did you hear that, Rowley darling?</p>

<p>NEWTON. In these very simple matters one may learn from anyone. And
you, madam, must have very remarkable mental powers. You repeat long
parts from memory in the theatre. I could not do that.</p>

<p>NELLY. Bless me, so I do, Mr Newton. You are the first man I ever
met who did not think an actress must be an ignorant ninny--except
schoolboys, who think she is a goddess. I declare you are the wisest
man in England, and the kindest.</p>

<p>CHARLES. And the busiest, Nelly. Come. He has given us as much of
his time as we have any right to ask for.</p>

<p>NELLY. Yes, I know. I am coming. <i>[She rises and goes to Charles,
whose left arm she takes].</i> May I come again, Mr Newton?</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[rising]</i> No no no no no, madam, I cannot entertain
ladies. They do not fit into my way of life. Mr Rowley: you are well
known to be as interested in ladies as I am interested in the
Scriptures; and I thank you for bringing this very attractive sample
for my diversion--</p>

<p>NELLY <i>[as if tasting a sweet]</i> Oh!</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[continuing]</i>--but sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof--</p>

<p>NELLY <i>[in violent protest]</i> Oh!!!</p>

<p>NEWTON.--and I beg you will bring no more ladies here until I have
time to set aside a day of relaxation for their reception.</p>

<p>NELLY. We must go, Rowley darling. He doesnt want us.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You are fortunate, Mr Newton, in suffering nothing worse
than Nell. But I promise you your house shall be a monastery
henceforth.</p>

<p><i>As Charles and Nell turn to the door to go out, the Duchess of
Cleveland, 39, formerly Lady Castlemaine, and born Barbara Villiers,
bursts into the room and confronts them in a tearing rage.</i></p>

<p>BARBARA. Ah! I have caught you, have I, with your trull. This is the
scientific business which made it impossible for you to see me this
morning.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Be silent for a moment, Barbara, whilst I present you to Mr
Newton, the eminent philosopher, in whose house you are an uninvited
guest.</p>

<p>BARBARA. A pretty house. A pretty philosopher. A house kept for you
to meet your women in.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM <i>[coming indignantly to the middle of the room]</i> Oh!
Mr Newton: either this female leaves the house this instant or I
do.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Do you know, woman, that you are speaking of the Duchess of
Cleveland?</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. I do not care who I am speaking of. If you are the
Duchess of Cleveland and this house were what you said it was you would
be only too much at home in it. The house being what it is you are out
of place in it. You go or I go.</p>

<p>BARBARA. You insolent slut, I will have you taken to the Bridewell
and whipped.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You shall not, Barbara. If you do not come down with me to
your carriage without another word, I will throw you downstairs.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Do. Kill me; and be happy with that low stage player. You
have been unfaithful to me with her a thousand times.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Patience, patience, patience. Mrs Basham: the lady is not in
a state of reason: I will prove to you that what she says has no sense
and need not distress us. <i>[To Barbara]</i> Your Grace alleges that
Mr Rowley has been unfaithful to you a thousand times.</p>

<p>BARBARA. A hundred thousand times.</p>

<p>NEWTON. For each unfaithfulness allow a day--or shall I say a night?
Now one hundred thousand nights are almost two hundred and seventyfour
years. To be precise, 273 years 287 days, allowing 68 days for Leap
Year every four years. Now Mr Rowley is not 300 years old: he is only
fifty, from which you must deduct at least fifteen years for his
childhood.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Fourteen.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Let us say fourteen. Probably your Grace was also
precocious. How many years shall we strike off your age for the days of
your innocence?</p>

<p>NELL. Five at most.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Be silent, you.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Say twelve. That makes you in effect about twentyeight.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Have I denied it?</p>

<p>NELL. Flatterer!</p>

<p>NEWTON. Twentyeight to Mr Rowley's thirtysix. Your grace has been
available since, say, the year 1652, twentyeight years ago. My
calculation is therefore correct.</p>

<p>BARBARA. May I ask what you mean by available?</p>

<p>NEWTON. I mean that the number of occasions on which Mr Rowley could
possibly be unfaithful to you is ten thousand two hundred and twenty
plus seven for leap years. Yet you allege one hundred thousand
occasions, and claim to have lived for nearly three centuries. As that
is impossible, it is clear that you have been misinformed about
Mistress Gwynn.</p>

<p><i>Nell claps vigorously.</i></p>

<p>BARBARA <i>[to Newton]</i> Are you mocking me, sir?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Figures cannot mock, because they cannot feel. That is their
great quality, and their great fault. <i>[He goes to the door].</i> And
now may I have the honor of conducting your Grace to your coach--or is
it one of those new fangled sedan chairs? Or would your Grace prefer to
be thrown down my humble staircase by Mr Rowley? It has twentyfour
steps, in two flights.</p>

<p>BARBARA. I will not leave this house until that player woman has
gone first. <i>[She strides past them and plants herself in Newton's
chair].</i></p>

<p>NELL. After all, dear, it's Mr Newton's house and not ours. He was
in the act of putting me out when you burst in. I stayed only because I
wanted to see you in one of those tantrums of yours that Rowley so
often tells me about. I might copy them on the stage.</p>

<p>BARBARA. He dares talk to you about me!!</p>

<p>NELL. He talks to me about everything, dear, because I let him get
in a word occasionally, which is more than you do.</p>

<p>BARBARA <i>[to Charles]</i> Will you stand there and let me be
insulted by this woman?</p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[with conviction]</i> Barbara: I am tired of your
tantrums. I made you a duchess: you behave like a streetwalker. I
pensioned you and packed you off to Paris; you have no business to be
here. Pastor: what have you to say to all this? You are the oldest and
wisest person present, are you not?</p>

<p>FOX. Fiftysix. And still a child in wisdom.</p>

<p>BARBARA <i>[contemptuously, noticing Fox for the first time]</i>
What does this person know about women?</p>

<p>FOX. Only what the woman in myself teaches me.</p>

<p>NELL. Good for leather breeches! What do you think of her,
George?</p>

<p>FOX. She prates overmuch about unfaithfulness. The man Rowley cannot
be unfaithful to her because he has pledged no faith to her. To his
wife only can he be unfaithful.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Wrong, Pastor. You do not know my wife. To her only I can
never be unfaithful.</p>

<p>NELL. Yes: you are kind to us; but we are nothing to you.
<i>[Sighing]</i> I would change places with her.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Will you order this common player to be silent in my
presence?</p>

<p>NELL. It is not fair of her to keep mentioning my profession when I
cannot decently mention hers.</p>

<p><i>With a scream of rage the duchess rises to fly at Nell, but is
seized by Fox, who drags down her raised fists and throws her back into
the chair.</i></p>

<p>FOX <i>[sternly]</i> Woman: behave yourself. In any decent English
village you would go to the ducking stool to teach you good manners and
gentle speech. You must control yourself--</p>

<p><i>He is interrupted by the clangor of a church bell, which has a
terrible effect on him.</i></p>

<p>FOX <i>[in a thundering voice, forgetting all about the duchess]</i>
Ha! I am called: I must go.</p>

<p><i>He makes for the door but is stopped by Charles, who, releasing
Nell, shuts it quickly and posts himself with his back to it.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. Stop. You are going to brawl in church. You will be thrown
into prison; and I shall not be able to save you.</p>

<p>FOX. The bell, the bell. It strikes upon my life. I am called.
Earthly kings cannot stay me. Let me pass.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Stand back, Mr Fox. My person is sacred.</p>

<p>NEWTON. What is the matter?</p>

<p>CHARLES. The church bell: it drives him mad. Someone send and stop
it.</p>

<p><i>The bell stops.</i></p>

<p>FOX. God has stopped it. <i>[He falls on his knees and collapses,
shivering like a man recovering from a fit].</i></p>

<p><i>Charles and Newton help him to his feet and lead him back to his
chair.</i></p>

<p>FOX <i>[to Charles]</i> Another stroke, and I should not have
answered for your life.</p>

<p>BARBARA. You must control yourself, preacher. In any decent English
village you would be put in the stocks to teach you good manners.</p>

<p>FOX. Woman: I have been put in the stocks; and I shall be put there
again. But I will continue to testify against the steeple house and the
brazen clangor of its belfries.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Now Mr Fox. You must not say such things here.</p>

<p>FOX. I tell you that from the moment you allow this manmade monster
called a Church to enter your mind your inner light is like an
extinguished candle; and your soul is plunged in darkness and damned.
There is no atheist like the Church atheist. I have converted many a
poor atheist who would have been burnt or hanged if God had not sent
him into my hands; but I have never converted a churchman: his answer
to everything is not his God, but the Church, the Church, the Church.
They burn each other, these churchmen: they persecute: they do
wickednesses of which no friend of God would be capable.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. The Popish Church, not the Protestant one, Mr Fox.</p>

<p>FOX. All, all, all of them. They are all snares of the devil. They
stand between Man and his Maker, and take on themselves divine powers
when they lack divine attributes. Am I to hold my peace in the face of
this iniquity? When the bell rings to announce some pitiful rascal
twaddling in his pulpit, or some fellow in a cassock pretending to bind
and loose, I hear an Almighty Voice call "George Fox, George Fox: rise
up: testify: unmask these impostors: drag them down from their pulpits
and their altars; and let it be known that what the world needs to
bring it back to God is not Churchmen but Friends, Friends of God,
Friends of man, friendliness and sincerity everywhere, superstition and
pulpit playacting nowhere."</p>

<p>CHARLES. Pastor: it is not given to every man as it has been to you
to make a religion for himself. A ready-made Church is an indispensable
convenience for most of us. The inner light must express itself in
music, in noble architecture, in eloquence: in a word, in beauty,
before it can pass into the minds of common men. I grant you the clergy
are mostly dull dogs; but with a little disguise and ritual they will
pass as holy men with the ignorant. And there are great mysteries that
must be symbolized, because though we feel them we do not know them, Mr
Newton having not yet discovered their nature, in spite of all his
mathematics. And this reminds me that we are making a most
unwarrantable intrusion on our host's valuable time. Mr Newton: on my
honor I had no part in bringing upon you this invasion of womanhood. I
hasten to take them away, and will wait upon you at some happier
moment. Come, ladies: we must leave Mr Newton to his mathematics.
<i>[He is about to go to the door. Barbara rises to accompany
him].</i></p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[stopping him]</i> I must correct that misunderstanding,
sir. I would not have you believe that I could be so inhospitable as to
drive away my guests merely to indulge in the trifling pursuit of
mathematical calculation, which leads finally nowhere. But I have more
serious business in hand this morning. I am engaged in a study of the
prophecies in the book of Daniel. <i>[He indicates the Bible].</i> It
may prove of the greatest importance to the world. I beg you to allow
me to proceed with it in the necessary solitude. The ladies have not
wasted my time: I have to thank her Grace of Cleveland for some lights
on the Book of Revelation suggested to me by her proceedings. But
solitude--solitude absolutely free from the pleasant disturbance of
ladies' society--is now necessary to me; and I must beg you to
withdraw.</p>

<p><i>Sally, now dressed in her best, throws the door open from
without, and proudly announces</i>--</p>

<p>SALLY. Her Grace the Duchess of Portsmouth.</p>

<p><i>Louise de K&eacute;roualle, a Frenchwoman who at 30 retains her
famous babyish beauty, appears on the threshold.</i></p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[beside himself]</i> Another woman! Take her away. Take
them all away. <i>[He flings himself into his chair at the table and
buries his face in his hands].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. Louise: it is unlike you to pursue me. We are unwelcome
here.</p>

<p>LOUISE <i>[coming over to him]</i> Pursue you! But I have never been
so surprised in my life as to find you here. And Nelly! And her Grace
of Cleveland back from Paris! What are you all doing here? I came to
consult Mr Newton, the alchemist. <i>[Newton straightens up and
stares].</i> My business with him is private: it is with him, not with
you, cheri. I did not know he was holding a reception.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Mr Newton is not an alchemist.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Pardon me: he is.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Mr Newton: are you an alchemist?</p>

<p>NEWTON. My meditations on the ultimate constitution of matter have
convinced me that the transmutation of metals, and indeed of all
substances, must be possible. It is occurring every day. I understand
that you, Mr Rowley, have a private laboratory at Whitehall, in which
you are attempting the fixation of mercury.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Without success, Mr Newton. I shall give it up and try for
the philosopher's stone instead.</p>

<p>FOX. Would you endanger your souls by dabbling in magic? The
scripture says "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." Do you think
that God is fonder of sorcerers and wizards than of witches? If you
count the wrath of God as nothing, and are above the law by your rank,
are you not ashamed to believe such old wives' tales as the changing of
lead into gold by the philosopher's stone?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Pastor Fox: I thank you for your well-meant warning. Now let
me warn you. The man who begins by doubting the possibility of the
philosopher's stone soon finds himself beginning to doubt the
immortality of the soul. He ends by doubting the existence of the soul.
There is no witchcraft about these things. I am as certain of them as I
am of the fact that the world was created four thousand and four years
before the birth of our Lord.</p>

<p>FOX. And what warrant have you for that? The Holy Bible says nothing
of your four thousand and four. It tells us that the world was created
"in the beginning": a mighty word. "In the beginning"! Think of it if
you have any imagination. And because some fool in a steeplehouse,
dressed up like a stage player in robes and mitre, dares to measure the
days of the Almighty by his kitchen clock, you take his word before the
word of God! Shame on you, Isaac Newton, for making an idol of an
archbishop! There is no credulity like the credulity of
philosophers.</p>

<p>NEWTON. But the archbishop has counted the years! My own chronology
of the world has been founded on his calculation. Do you mean to tell
me that all the labor I have bestowed on that book has been wasted?</p>

<p>FOX. Sinfully wasted.</p>

<p>NEWTON. George Fox: you are an infidel. Leave my house.</p>

<p>FOX <i>[rising]</i> Your philosophy has led you to the conclusion
that George Fox is an infidel. So much the worse for your philosophy!
The Lord does not love men that count numbers. Read second Samuel,
chapter twentyfour: the book is before you. Good morning; and God bless
you and enlighten you. <i>[He turns to go].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. Stay, Pastor. <i>[He makes Fox sit down again and goes to
Newton, laying a hand on his shoulder].</i> Mr Newton: the word infidel
is not one to be used hastily between us three. Old Tom Hobbes, my
tutor, who was to me what Aristotle was to Alexander the Great, was
called an infidel. You yourself, in spite of your interest in the book
of Daniel, have been suspected of doubting whether the apple falls from
the tree by the act of God or by a purely physical attraction. Even I,
the head of the Church, the Defender of the Faith, stand between the
Whigs who suspect me of being a Papist and the Tories who suspect me of
being an atheist. Now the one thing that is true of all three of us is
that if the common people knew our real minds they would hang us and
bury us in unconsecrated ground. We must stand together, gentlemen.
What does it matter to us whether the world is four thousand years old,
or, as I should guess, ten thousand?</p>

<p>NEWTON. The world ten thousand years old! Sir: you are mad.</p>

<p>NELL <i>[shocked]</i> Rowley darling: you mustnt say such
things.</p>

<p>BARBARA. What business is it of yours, pray? He has always defied
God and betrayed women. He does not know the meaning of the word
religion. He laughed at it in France. He hated it in Scotland. In
England he believes nothing. He loves nothing. He fears nothing except
having to go on his travels again, as he calls it. What are ten
thousand years to him, or ten million?</p>

<p>FOX. Are ten million years beyond the competence of Almighty God?
They are but a moment in His eyes. Four thousand years seem an eternity
to a mayfly, or a mouse, or a mitred fool called an archbishop. Are we
mayflies? Are we mice? Are we archbishops?</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Mr Fox: I have listened to too much blasphemy this
morning. But to call an archbishop a mitred fool and compare him to a
mouse is beyond endurance. I cannot believe that God will ever pardon
you for that. Have you no fear of hell?</p>

<p>FOX. How shall I root out the sin of idolatry from this land?
Worship your God, woman, not a dressed-up priest.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. The archbishop is not a graven image. And when he is
officiating he is not in the likeness of anything in the heavens above
or on the earth beneath. I am afraid you do not know your catechism, Mr
Fox.</p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[laughing]</i> Excellent, Mrs Basham. Pastor: she has
gravelled you with the second commandment. And she has put us to shame
for quarrelling over a matter of which we know nothing. By the way,
where were we when we began to quarrel? I have clean forgotten.</p>

<p>LOUISE. It was my business with Mr Newton, I think. Nellie: will you
take our sovereign lord away and leave me to speak with the alchemist
in private?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Mr Newton: not for worlds would I deprive you of a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with her Grace of Portsmouth.
Pastor: you will accompany us. Nellie: you will come with the pastor.
But first I must throw the Duchess of Cleveland downstairs <i>[moving
towards her].</i></p>

<p>BARBARA <i>[screaming and making for the door]</i> Coward! Help!
Murder! <i>[She rushes out].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. Your servant, Mrs Basham.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Basham curtsies. Charles salutes her and goes out.</i></p>

<p>NELL <i>[beckoning to Fox]</i> Come on, leather breeches.</p>

<p>FOX <i>[rising and going towards the door]</i> Well, what you are,
God made you. I am bound to be your friend.</p>

<p>NELL <i>[taking his arm as he passes]</i> I am proud of your
friendship, George.</p>

<p><i>They go out arm in arm.</i></p>

<p><i>Louise, being now the person of highest rank present, follows
them as far as the armchair, in which she seats herself with
distinguished elegance.</i></p>

<p>LOUISE <i>[to Mrs Basham]</i> Madam: may I have a moment alone with
the alchemist?</p>

<p>NEWTON. You certainly may not, your Grace. I will not have Mr Locke
and his friends accuse me of having relations with women. If your
business cannot be discussed before Mrs Basham it cannot be discussed
with me. And you will please not speak of me as "the alchemist" as you
might speak of the apothecary or the chimney sweep. I am by
profession--if it can be called a profession--a philosopher.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Pardon: I am not habituated to your English manners. It is
strange to me that a philosopher should need a chaperon. In France it
is I who should need one.</p>

<p>NEWTON. You are quite safe with me and Mrs Basham, madam. What is
your business?</p>

<p>LOUISE. I want a love charm.</p>

<p>NEWTON. A what?</p>

<p>LOUISE. A love charm. Something that will make my lover faithful to
me if I drop it into his tay. And mind! it must make him love me, and
not love everybody. He is far too amorous already of every pretty woman
he meets. I make no secret of who he is: all the world knows it. The
love charm must not do him any harm; for if we poison the king we shall
be executed in the most horrible manner. It must be something that will
be good for him.</p>

<p>NEWTON. And peculiar to yourself? Not to Mistress Gwynn?</p>

<p>LOUISE. I do not mind Nellie: she is a dear, and so helpful when
there is any trouble or illness. He picked her up out of the gutter;
but the good God sometimes drops a jewel there: my nurse, a peasant
woman, was worth a thousand duchesses. Yes: he may have Nellie: a
change is sometimes good for men.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM <i>[fearfully shocked]</i> Oh! Mr Newton: I must go. I
cannot stay and listen to this French lady's talk. <i>[She goes out
with dignity].</i></p>

<p>LOUISE. I shall never understand the things that Englishwomen are
prudish about. And they are so extraordinarily coarse in other things.
May I stay, now that your chaperon has gone?</p>

<p>NEWTON: You will not want to stay when I tell you that I do not deal
in love potions. Ask the nearest apothecary for an aphrodisiac.</p>

<p>LOUISE. But I cannot trust a common apothecary: it would be all over
the town tomorrow. Nobody will suspect you. I will pay any price you
like.</p>

<p>NEWTON. I tell you, madam, I know nothing about such things. If I
wished to make you fall in love with me--which God forbid!--I should
not know how to set about it. I should learn to play some musical
instrument, or buy a new wig.</p>

<p>LOUISE. But you are an alchemist: you must know.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Then I am not an alchemist. But the changing of Bodies into
Light and Light into Bodies is very conformable to the Course of
Nature, which seems delighted with Transmutations.</p>

<p>LOUISE. I do not understand. What are transmutations?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Never mind, madam. I have other things to do than to peddle
love charms to the King's ladies.</p>

<p>LOUISE <i>[ironically]</i> Yes: to entertain the Duchess of
Cleveland and Mistress Gwynn, and hire a mad preacher to amuse them!
What else have you to do that is more important than my business with
you?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Many other things. For instance, to ascertain the exact
distance of the sun from the earth.</p>

<p>LOUISE. But what a waste of time! What can it possibly matter
whether the sun is twenty miles away or twentyfive?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Twenty or twentyfive!!! The sun is millions and millions of
miles from the earth.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Oh! Oh!! Oh!!! You are quite mad, Monsieur Nieuton. At such
a distance you could not see it. You could not feel its heat. Well, you
cannot see it so plainly here as in France, nor so often; but you can
see it quite plainly sometimes. And you can feel its heat. It burns
your skin, and freckles you if you are sandyhaired. And then comes a
little cloud over it and you shiver with cold. Could that happen if it
were a thousand miles away?</p>

<p>NEWTON. It is very very large, madam. It is one million three
hundred thousand times heavier than the earth.</p>

<p>LOUISE. My good Monsieur Nieuton: do not be so fanciful.
<i>[Indicating the window]</i> Look at it. Look at it. It is much
smaller than the earth. If I hold up a sou--what you call a
ha-pen-ny--before my eye, it covers the sun and blots it out. Let me
teach you something, Monsieur Nieuton. A great French philosopher,
Blaise Pascal, teached me this. You must never let your imagination run
away with you. When you think of grandiose things--hundreds of millions
and things like that--you must continually come down to earth to keep
sane. You must see: you must feel: you must measure.</p>

<p>NEWTON. That is very true, madam. Above all, you must measure. And
when you measure you find that many things are bigger than they look.
The sun is one of them.</p>

<p>LOUISE <i>[rising and going to the table to coax him]</i> Ah! You
are impossible. But you will make me a love potion, will you not?</p>

<p>NEWTON. I will write you a prescription, madam.</p>

<p><i>He takes a sheet of paper and writes the prescription. Louise
watches as he writes.</i></p>

<p>LOUISE. Aqua? But aqua is only water, monsieur.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Water with a cabalistic sign after it, madam.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Ah, parfaitement. And this long magical word, what is it?
Mee-kah-pah-nees. What is that?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Micapanis, madam. A very powerful lifegiving substance.</p>

<p>LOUISE. It sounds wonderful. Is it harmless?</p>

<p>NEWTON. The most harmless substance in the world, madam, and the
most precious.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Truly you are a great man, Monsieur Nieuton, in spite of
your millions of miles. And this last word here?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Only sugar, to sweeten the micapanis, but with the
cabalistic sign after it. Here is your love charm, madam. But it is not
a potion: the apothecary will make it into pills for you.</p>

<p>LOUISE <i>[taking the paper and tucking it into the bosom of her
dress]</i> Good. That is better, much better. It is so much easier to
make men take pills than drink potions. And now, one thing more. You
must swear to give this prescription to no other woman of the court. It
is for me alone.</p>

<p>NEWTON. You have my word of honor, madam.</p>

<p>LOUISE. But a word of honor must be a gentleman's word of honor.
You, monsieur, are a bourgeois. You must swear on your Bible.</p>

<p>NEWTON. My word is my word, madam. And the Bible must not be mixed
up with the magic of micapanis.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Not black magic, is it? I could not touch that.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Neither black nor white, madam. Shall we say grey? But quite
harmless, I assure you.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Good. And now I must make you a little present for your
pills. How much shall it be?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Keep your money for the apothecary, madam: he will be amply
satisfied with five shillings. I am sufficiently rewarded by the sound
scientific advice you have given me from your friend Blaise Pascal. He
was anticipated by an Englishman named Bacon, who was, however, no
mathematician. You owe me nothing.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Shall I give one of the new golden guineas to the lady I
shocked if I meet her on the stairs?</p>

<p>NEWTON. No. She would not take it.</p>

<p>LOUISE. How little you know the world, Monsieur! Nobody refuses a
golden guinea.</p>

<p>NEWTON. You can try the experiment, madam. That would be the advice
of your friend Pascal. <i>[He goes to the door, and opens it for
her].</i></p>

<p>LOUISE. Perhaps I had better make it two guineas. She will never
refuse that.</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[at the door, calling]</i> Sally!</p>

<p>LOUISE <i>[with a gracious inclination of her head]</i>
Monsieur--</p>

<p>NEWTON. I wish your Grace good morning.</p>

<p>SALLY <i>[at the door]</i> Yes, sir?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Shew her Grace the Duchess of Portsmouth to her chair or
whatever it is.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Au plaisir de vous revoir, Monsieur le philosophe.</p>

<p><i>The Duchess goes out, Sally making her a rustic curtsey as she
passes, and following her out, leaving Newton alone.</i></p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[greatly relieved]</i> Ouf!</p>

<p><i>He returns to his place at the table and to his Bible, which,
helped by a marker, he opens at the last two chapters of the book of
Daniel. He props his head on his elbows.</i></p>

<p>NEWTON. Twelve hundred and ninety days. And in the very next verse
thirteen hundred and thirtyfive days. Five months difference! And the
king's daughter of the south: who was she? And the king of the south?
And he that cometh against him? And the vile person who obtains the
kingdom by flatteries? And Michael? Who was Michael? <i>[He considers
this a moment; then suddenly snatches a sheet of paper and writes
furiously].</i></p>

<p>SALLY <i>[throwing open the door, bursting with pride]</i> His Royal
Highness the Duke of York.</p>

<p><i>The Duke, afterwards James II, comes in precipitately.</i></p>

<p>JAMES <i>[imperiously]</i> Where is his Majesty the King?</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[rising in ungovernable wrath]</i> Sir: I neither know nor
care where the King is. This is my house; and I demand to be left in
peace in it. I am engaged in researches of the most sacred importance;
and for them I require solitude. Do you hear, sir? solitude!</p>

<p>JAMES. Sir: I am the Duke of York, the King's brother.</p>

<p>NEWTON: I am Isaac Newton, the philosopher. I am also an Englishman;
and my house is my castle. At least it was until this morning, when the
whole court came here uninvited. Are there not palaces for you and the
court to resort to? Go away.</p>

<p>JAMES. I know you. You are a follower of the arch infidel
Galileo!</p>

<p>NEWTON. Take care, sir. In my house the great Galileo shall not be
called an infidel by any Popish blockhead, prince or no prince. Galileo
had more brains in his boots than you have in your whole body.</p>

<p>JAMES. Had he more brains in his boots than the Catholic Church?
Than the Pope and all his cardinals, the greatest scholars of his day?
Is there more learning in your head than in the libraries of the
Vatican?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Popes and cardinals are abolished in the Church of England.
Only a fool would set up these superstitious idolaters against the
Royal Society, founded by your royal brother for the advancement of
British science.</p>

<p>JAMES. A club of damnable heretics. I shall know how to deal with
them.</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[rising in a fury and facing him menacingly]</i> Will you
leave my house, or shall I throw you out through the window?</p>

<p>JAMES. You throw me out! Come on, you scum of a grammar school.</p>

<p><i>They rush at one another, and in the scuffle fall on the floor,
Newton uppermost. Charles comes in at this moment.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. Odsfish, Mr Newton, whats this? A wrestling match?</p>

<p><i>Newton hastily rolls off James. The two combatants remain sitting
on the floor, staring up at Charles.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. And what the divvle are you doing here, Jamie? Why arnt you
in Holland?</p>

<p>JAMES. I am here where I have been thrown by your friend and
prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the infidel philosopher Newton.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Get up, man: dont play the fool. Mr Newton: your privilege
with me does not run to the length of knocking my brother down. It is a
serious matter to lay hands on a royal personage.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Sir: I had no intention of knocking your royal brother down.
He fell and dragged me down. My intention was only to throw him out of
the window.</p>

<p>CHARLES. He could have left by the door, Mr Newton.</p>

<p>NEWTON. He could; but he would not, in spite of my repeated
requests. He stayed here to heap insults on the immortal Galileo, whose
shoe latchet he is unworthy to unloose.</p>

<p><i>He rises and confronts the King with dignity.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. Will you get up, Jamie, and not sit on the floor grinning
like a Jackanapes. Get up, I tell you.</p>

<p>JAMES <i>[rising]</i> You see what comes of frequenting the houses
of your inferiors. They forget themselves and take liberties. And you
encourage heretics. I do not.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Mr Newton: we are in your house and at your orders. Will
you allow my brother and myself to have this room to ourselves
awhile?</p>

<p>NEWTON. My house is yours, sir. I am a resolute supporter of the
Exclusion Bill because I hope to prove that the Romish Church is the
little horn of the fourth beast mentioned by the prophet Daniel. But
the great day of wrath is not yet come. Your brother is welcome here as
long as you desire it.</p>

<p><i>Newton goes out. Charles takes the armchair. When he is seated
James takes Newton's chair at the table.</i></p>

<p>JAMES. That fellow is crazy. He called me a Popish blockhead. You
see what comes of encouraging these Protestants. If you had a pennorth
of spunk in you you would burn the lot.</p>

<p>CHARLES. What I want to know is what you are doing here when you
should be in Holland. I am doing what I can to stop this Exclusion Bill
and secure the crown for you when I die. I sent you to Holland so that
your talent for making yourself unpopular might be exercised there and
not here. Your life is in danger in London. You had no business to come
back. Why have you done it?</p>

<p>JAMES. Charles: I am a prince.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Oh, do I not know it, God help you!</p>

<p>JAMES. Our father lost his head by compromising with Protestants,
Republicans, Levellers and Atheists. What did he gain by it? They
beheaded him. I am not going to share his fate by repeating that
mistake. I am a Catholic; and I am civil to none but Catholics, however
unpopular it may make me. When I am king--as I shall be, in my own
right, and not by the leave of any Protestant parliamentary gang--I
shall restore the Church and restore the monarchy: yes, the monarchy,
Charles; for there has been no real Restoration: you are no king,
cleverly as you play with these Whigs and Tories. That is because you
have no faith, no principles: you dont believe in anything; and a man
who doesnt believe in anything is afraid of everything. Youre a damned
coward, Charles. I am not. When I am king I shall reign: these fellows
shall find what a king's will is when he reigns by divine right. They
will get it straight in the teeth then; and Europe will see them
crumble up like moths in a candle flame.</p>

<p>CHARLES. It is a funny thing, Jamie, that you, who are clever enough
to see that the monarchy is gone and that I keep the crown by my wits,
are foolish enough to believe that you have only to stretch out your
clenched fist and take it back again. I sometimes ask myself whether it
would not be far kinder of me to push the Exclusion Bill through and
save you from the fate of our father. They will have your head off
inside of five years unless you jump into the nearest fishing smack and
land in France.</p>

<p>JAMES. And leave themselves without a king again! Not they: they had
enough of that under old Noll's Major-Generals. Noll knew how to rule:
I will say that for him; and I thank him for the lesson. But when he
died they had to send for us. When they bully you you give in to them
and say that you dont want to go on your travels again. But by God, if
they try to bully me I will threaten to go on my travels and leave them
without a king. That is the way to bring them down on their
marrowbones.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You could not leave them without a king. Protestant
kings--Stuart kings--are six a penny in Europe today. The Dutch lad's
grandfather-in-law was our grandfather. Your daughter Mary is married
to him. The Elector of Hanover has the same hook on to grandfather
James. Both of them are rank Protestants and hardened soldiers, caring
for nothing but fighting the French. Besides Mary there is her sister
Anne, Church of England to the backbone. With the Protestants you do
not succeed by divine right: they take their choice and send for you,
just as they sent for me.</p>

<p>JAMES. Yes, if you look at it in that way and let them do it.
Charles: you havnt the spirit of a king: that is what is the matter
with you. As long as they let you have your women, and your dogs, and
your pictures, and your music, and your chemical laboratory, you let
them do as they like. The merry monarch: thats what you are.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Something new in monarchs, eh?</p>

<p>JAMES. Psha! A merry monarch is no monarch at all.</p>

<p>CHARLES. All the same, I must pack you off to Scotland. I cannot
have you here until I prorogue parliament to get rid of the Exclusion
Bill. And you will have to find a Protestant husband for Anne: remember
that.</p>

<p>JAMES. You pretend you are packing me off to save me from my
Catholic unpopularity. The truth is you are jealous of my
popularity.</p>

<p>CHARLES. No, Jamie: I can beat you at that game. I am an agreeable
sort of fellow: old Newcastle knocked that into me when I was a boy.
Living at the Hague on two hundred and forty pounds a year finished my
education in that respect. Now you, Jamie, became that very
disagreeable character a man of principle. The people, who have all
sorts of principles which they havnt gathered out of your basket, will
never take to you until you go about shouting No Popery. And you will
die rather than do that: wont you?</p>

<p>JAMES. Certainly I shall; and so, I trust, would you. Promise me you
will die a Catholic, Charles.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I shall take care not to die in an upstart sect like the
Church of England, and perhaps lose my place in Westminster Abbey when
you are king. Your principles might oblige you to throw my carcase to
the dogs. Meanwhile, however popular you may think yourself, you must
go and be popular in Scotland.</p>

<p>JAMES. I am popular everywhere: thats what you dont understand
because you are not a fighting man; and I am. In the British Isles,
Charles, nothing is more popular than the navy; and nobody is more
popular than the admiral who has won a great naval victory. Thats what
I have done, and you havnt. And that puts me ahead of you with the
British people every time.</p>

<p>CHARLES. No doubt; but the British people do not make kings in
England. The crown is in the hands of the damned Whig squirearchy who
got rich by robbing the Church, and chopped off father's head, crown
and all. They care no more for your naval victory than for a bunch of
groundsel. They would not pay for the navy if we called it ship money,
and let them know what they are paying for.</p>

<p>JAMES. I shall make them pay. I shall not be their puppet as you
are. Do you think I will be in the pay of the king of France, whose
bitter bread we had to eat in our childhood, and who left our mother
without firewood in the freezing winter? And all this because these
rebellious dogs will not disgorge enough of their stolen wealth to
cover the cost of governing them! If you will not teach them their
lesson they shall learn it from me.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You will have to take your money where you can get it,
Jamie, as I do. French money is as good as English. King Louis gets
little enough for it: I take care of that.</p>

<p>JAMES. Then you cheat him. How can you stoop?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I must. And I know that I must. To play the king as you
would have me I should need old Noll's army; and they took good care I
should not have that. They grudge me even the guards.</p>

<p>JAMES. Well, what old Noll could do I can do; and so could you if
you had the pluck. I will have an army too.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Of Protestants?</p>

<p>JAMES. The officers will be Catholics. The rank and file will be
what they are ordered to be.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Where will you get the money to pay them? Old Noll had the
city of London and its money at his back.</p>

<p>JAMES. The army will collect the taxes. How does King Louis do it?
He keeps the biggest army in Europe; and he keeps you into the bargain.
He hardly knows what a parliament is. He dragoons the Protestants out
of France into Spitalfields. I shall dragoon them out of
Spitalfields.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Where to?</p>

<p>JAMES. To hell, or to the American plantations, whichever they
prefer.</p>

<p>CHARLES. So you are going to be the English Louis, the British Roi
Soleil, the sun king. This is a deuced foggy climate for sun kings,
Jamie.</p>

<p>JAMES. So you think, Charles. But the British climate has nothing to
do with it. What is it that nerves Louis to do all these things? The
climate of the Catholic Church. His foot is on the rock of Saint Peter;
and that makes him a rock himself.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Your son-in-law Dutch Billy is not afraid of him. And
Billy's house is built, not on a rock, not even on the sands, but in
the mud of the North Sea. Keep your eye on the Orangeman, Jamie.</p>

<p>JAMES. I shall keep my eye on your Protestant bastard Monmouth. Why
do you make a pet of that worthless fellow? Know you not he is longing
for your death so that he may have a try for the crown while this
rascally Popish plot is setting the people against me?</p>

<p>CHARLES. For my death! What a thought! I grant you he has not the
makings of a king in him: I am not blind to his weaknesses. But surely
he is not heartless.</p>

<p>JAMES. Psha! there is not a plot in the kingdom to murder either of
us that he is not at the bottom of.</p>

<p>CHARLES. He is not deep enough to be at the bottom of anything,
Jamie.</p>

<p>JAMES. Then he is at the top. I forgive him for wanting to make an
end of me: I am no friend of his. But to plot against you, his father!
you, who have petted him and spoilt him and forgiven him treason after
treason! for that I shall not forgive him, as he shall find if ever he
falls into my hand.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Jamie: this is a dreadful suspicion to put into my mind. I
thought the lad had abused my affection until it was exhausted; but it
still can hurt. Heaven keep him out of your hand! that is all I can
say. Absalom! O Absalom: my son, my son!</p>

<p>JAMES. I am sorry, Charles; but this is what comes of bringing up
your bastards as Protestants and making dukes of them.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Let me tell you a secret, Jamie: a king's secret. Peter the
fisherman did not know everything. Neither did Martin Luther.</p>

<p>JAMES. Neither do you.</p>

<p>CHARLES. No; but I must do the best I can with what I know, and not
with what Peter and Martin knew. Anyhow, the long and the short of it
is that you must start for Scotland this very day, and stay there until
I send you word that it is safe for you to come back.</p>

<p>JAMES. Safe! What are you afraid of, man? If you darent face these
Protestant blackguards, is that any reason why I should run away from
them?</p>

<p>CHARLES. You were talking just now about your popularity. Do you
know who is the most popular man in England at present?</p>

<p>JAMES. Shaftesbury, I suppose. He is the Protestant hero just as
Nelly is the Protestant whoor. I tell you Shaftesbury will turn his
coat as often as you crack your whip. Why dont you crack it?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I am not thinking of Shaftesbury.</p>

<p>JAMES. Then who?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Oates.</p>

<p>JAMES. Titus Oates! A navy chaplain kicked out of the service for
the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah! Are you afraid of him?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Yes. At present he is the most popular man in the kingdom.
He is lodged in my palace at Whitehall with a pension of four hundred
pounds a year.</p>

<p>JAMES. What!!!</p>

<p>CHARLES. And I, who am called a king, cannot get rid of him. This
house is Isaac Newton's; and he can order you out and throw you out of
the window if you dont go. But my house must harbor the vilest
scoundrel in Europe while he parades in lawn sleeves through the street
with his No Popery mob at his heels, and murders our best Catholic
families with his brazen perjuries and his silly Popish plot that
should not impose on a rabbit. No man with eyes in his head could look
at the creature for an instant without seeing that he is only half
human.</p>

<p>JAMES. Flog him through the town. Flog him to death. They can if
they lay on hard enough and long enough. The same mob that now takes
him for a saint will crowd to see the spectacle and revel in his
roarings.</p>

<p>CHARLES. That will come, Jamie. I am hunting out his record; and
your man Jeffries will see to it that the poor divvle shall have no
mercy. But just now it is not Oates that we have to kill: the people
would say that he was murdered by the Catholics and run madder than
ever. They blame the Catholics now for the Great Fire of London and the
plague. We must kill the Popish Plot first. When we have done that, God
help Titus Oates! Meanwhile, away with you to Scotland and try your
cat-o-ninetails on the Covenanters there.</p>

<p>JAMES. Well, I suppose I must, since England is governed by its mob
instead of by its king. But I tell you, Charles, when I am king there
shall be no such nonsense. You jeer at me and say that I am the
protector of your life, because nobody will kill you to make me king;
but I take that as the highest compliment you could pay me. This mob
that your Protestant Republicans and Presbyterians and Levellers call
the people of England will have to choose between King James the Second
and King Titus Oates. And James and the Church--and there is only one
real Church of God--will see to it that their choice will be Hobson's
choice.</p>

<p>CHARLES. The people of England will have nothing to do with it. The
real Levellers today, Jamie, are the lords and the rich
squires--Cromwell's sort--and the moneyed men of the city. They will
keep the people's noses to the grindstone no matter what happens. And
their choice will be not between you and Titus Oates, but between your
daughter Mary's Protestant husband and you.</p>

<p>JAMES. He will have to cross the seas to get here. And I, as Lord
High Admiral of England, will meet him on the seas and sink him there.
He is no great general on land: on water he is nothing. I have never
been beaten at sea.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Jamie, Jamie: nothing frightens me so much as your simple
stupid pluck, and your faith in Rome. You think you will have the Pope
at your back because you are a Catholic. You are wrong: in politics the
Pope is always a Whig, because every earthly monarch's court is a rival
to the Vatican.</p>

<p>JAMES. Do you suppose that if Orange Billy, the head of the
Protestant heresy in Europe, the anti-Pope you might call him, dared to
interfere with me, a Catholic king, the Pope could take his part
against me in the face of all Europe! How can you talk such nonsense?
Do you think Mary would share the crown if he tore it from her father's
head? Rochester called you the king that never said a foolish thing and
never did a wise one; but it seems to me that you talk silly-clever
nonsense all day, though you are too wise: that is, too big a coward,
ever to risk a fight with the squirearchy. What are they in France?
Lackeys round the throne at Versailles: not one of them dare look King
Louis straight in the face. But in France there is a real king.</p>

<p>CHARLES. He has a real army and real generals. And taxes galore. Old
Noll went one better than Louis: he was a general himself. And what a
general! Preston, Dunbar, Worcester: we could no nothing against him
though we had everything on our side, except him. I have been looking
for his like ever since we came back. I sometimes wonder whether Jack
Churchill has any military stuff in him.</p>

<p>JAMES. What! That henpecked booby! I suppose you know that he got
his start in life as your Barbara's kept man?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I know that the poor lad risked breaking his bones by
jumping out of Barbara's window when she was seducing him and I came
along unexpectedly. I have always liked him for that.</p>

<p>JAMES. It was worth his while. She gave him five thousand pounds for
it.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Yes: I had to find the money. I was tremendously flattered
when I heard of it. I had no idea that Barbara put so high a price on
my belief in her faithfulness, in which, by the way, I did not believe.
Poor Barbara was never alone with a pretty fellow for five minutes
without finding out how much of a man he was. I threw Churchill in her
way purposely to keep her in good humor. What struck me most in the
affair was that Jack bought an annuity with the money instead of
squandering it as any other man of his age would have done. That was a
sign of solid ability. He may be henpecked: what married man is not?
But he is no booby.</p>

<p>JAMES. Meanness. Pure meanness. The Churchills never had a penny to
bless themselves with. Jack got no more education than my groom.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Latin grammar is not much use on the battlefield, as we
found out. Turenne found Jack useful enough in Spain; and Turenne was
supposed to be France's greatest general. Your crown may depend on
Jack: by the time I die he will be as old a soldier as Oliver was at
Dunbar.</p>

<p>JAMES. Never fear. I shall buy him if he's worth it.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Or if you are worth it. Jack is a good judge of a
winner.</p>

<p>JAMES. He has his price all the same.</p>

<p>CHARLES. All intelligent men have, Jamie.</p>

<p>JAMES. Psha! Dont waste your witticisms on me: they butter no
parsnips. If he can pick a winner he had better pick me.</p>

<p>CHARLES. There are only two horses in the race now: the Protestant
and the Catholic. I have to ride both at once.</p>

<p>JAMES. That was what Father tried to do. See what he got by it!</p>

<p>CHARLES. See what I get by it! Not much, perhaps; but I keep my head
on my shoulders. It takes a man of brains to do that. Our father
unfortunately tried his hand at being also a man of blood, as Noll
called him. We Stuarts are no good at that game: Noll beat us at it
every time. I hate blood and battles: I have seen too much of them to
have any dreams of glory about them. I am, as you say, no king. To be
what you call a king I lack military ambition; and I lack cruelty. I
have to manage Protestants who are so frightfully cruel that I dare not
interfere with Protestant judges who are merciless. The penalty for
high treason is so abominable that only a divvle could have invented
it, and a nation of divvles crowd to see it done. The only time I
risked my crown was when I stopped them after they had butchered ten of
the regicides: I could bear no more. They were not satisfied: they dug
up the body of old Noll, and butchered it rather than have their
horrible sport cut short.</p>

<p>JAMES. Serve the rascals right! A good lesson for them and their
like. Dont be such a mollycoddle, Charles. What you need is a bit of my
sea training to knock the nonsense out of you.</p>

<p>CHARLES. So you will try your luck as a man of blood, will you?</p>

<p>JAMES. I will do what is necessary. I will fight my enemies if they
put me to it. I will take care that those who put me to it shall not
die easy deaths.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Well, that will seem very natural to the mob. You will find
plenty of willing tools. But I would not light the fires of Smithfield
again if I were you. Your pet Jeffries would do it for you and enjoy
it; but Protestants do not like being burnt alive.</p>

<p>JAMES. They will have to lump it if they fly in the face of God.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Oh, go to Scotland: go to Jericho. You sicken me. Go.</p>

<p>JAMES. Charles! We must not part like this. You know you always
stand by me as far as you dare. I ought not to talk to you about
government and kingcraft: you dont understand these matters and never
will; and I do understand them. I have resolved again and again not to
mention them to you; for after all we are brothers; and I love you in
spite of all the times you have let me down with the Protestants. It is
not your fault that you have no head for politics and no knowledge of
human nature. You need not be anxious about me. I will leave for
Scotland tomorrow. But I have business in London tonight that I will
not postpone for fifty thousand Titus Oateses.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Business in London tonight! The one redeeming point in your
character, Jamie, is that you are not a man of principle in the matter
of women.</p>

<p>JAMES. You are quite wrong there: I am in all things a man of
principle and a good Catholic, thank God. But being human I am also a
man of sin. I confess it; and I do my penances!</p>

<p>CHARLES. The women themselves are worse penances than any priest
dare inflict on you. Try Barbara: a week with her is worse than a month
in hell. But I have given up all that now. Nelly is a good little soul
who amuses me. Louise manages my French affairs. She has French brains
and manners, and is always a lady. But they are now my friends only:
affectionate friends, family friends, nothing else. And they alone are
faithful to the elderly king. I am fifty, Jamie, fifty: dont forget
that. And women got hold of me when I was fourteen, thirtysix years
ago. Do you suppose I have learnt nothing about women and what you call
love in that time? You still have love affairs: I have none. However, I
am not reproaching you: I am congratulating you on being still young
and green enough to come all the way from Holland for a night in
London.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Basham returns, much perturbed.</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Mr Rowley: I must tell you that I cannot receive any
more of your guests. I have not knives nor plates nor glasses enough. I
have had to borrow chairs from next door. Your valet, Mr Chiffinch,
tells who ever has any business with you this morning to come on here.
Mr Godfrey Kneller, the new Dutch painter, with a load of implements
connected with his trade, had got in in spite of me: he heard the noise
your people were making. There are the two ladies and the player woman,
and yourself and your royal brother and Mr Fox and the painter. That
makes seven; and Mr Newton makes eight and I make nine. I have nothing
to offer them but half a decanter of sherry that was opened last
Easter, and the remains of a mouldy cake. I have sent Sally out with
orders that will run away with a fortnight's housekeeping money; and
that wont be half what theyll expect. I thought they were all going
away when they came downstairs; but the French lady wanted to look
through Mr Newton's telescope; and the jealous lady wouldnt leave until
the French lady left; and the player woman is as curious as a magpie
and makes herself as much at home as if she lived here. It has ended in
their all staying. And now Mr Newton is explaining everything and
shewing off his telescope and never thinking what I am to do with them!
How am I to feed them?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Dont feed them, Mrs Basham. Starve them out.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Oh no: I cant do that. What would they think of us? Mr
Newton has his position to keep up.</p>

<p>CHARLES. It is the judgment of heaven on you for turning away my
pretty spaniels from your door this morning.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. There were twelve of them, sir.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You would have found them much better company than nine
human beings. But never mind. Sally will tell all the tradesmen that Mr
Newton is entertaining me and my brother. They will call themselves
Purveyors to his Majesty the King. Credit will be unlimited.</p>

<p>JAMES. Remember that this is Friday: a fast day. All I need is three
or four different kinds of fish.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. No, sir: in this house you will have to be content with
a Protestant dinner. Jack the fish hawker is gone. But he left us a
nice piece of cod; and thats all youll get, sir.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Jamie: we must clear out and take the others with us. It
seems we cannot visit anyone without ruining them.</p>

<p>JAMES. Pooh! What can a few pounds more or less matter to
anybody?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I can remember when they meant a divvle of a lot to me, and
to you too. Let us get back to Newmarket.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. No, sir: Mr Newton would not like that: he knows his
duties as your host. And if you will excuse me saying so, sir: you all
look as if a plain wholesome dinner would do you no harm for once in a
way. By your leave I will go to look after it. I must turn them all out
of the laboratory and send them up here while I lay the table
there.</p>

<p><i>She goes out.</i></p>

<p>JAMES. "A nice piece of cod!" Among nine people!</p>

<p>CHARLES. "Isnt that a dainty dish to set before a king?" Your fast
will be a real fast, Jamie, for the first time in your life.</p>

<p>JAMES. You lie. My penances are all real.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Well, a hunk of bread, a lump of cheese, and a bottle of
ale are enough for me or for any man at this hour.</p>

<p><i>All the rest come back except Mrs Basham, Barbara, and Newton.
Fox comes first.</i></p>

<p>FOX. I have made eight new friends. But has the Lord sent them to
me? Such friends! <i>[He takes his old seat, much perplexed].</i></p>

<p>NELL <i>[coming in]</i> Oh, Rowley darling, they want me to recite
my big speech from The Indian Emperor. But I cant do that without
proper drapery: its classical. <i>[Going to the Duke]</i> And what is
my Jamie doing here?</p>

<p>LOUISE <i>[taking a chair from the wall and planting it at Charles's
right, familiarly close]</i> Why not give us a prologue? Your prologues
are your best things. <i>[She sits].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES and JAMES. Yes, yes: a prologue.</p>

<p><i>All are now seated, except Nell.</i></p>

<p>NELL. But I cant do a prologue unless I am in breeches.</p>

<p>FOX <i>[rising]</i> No. Eleanor Gwyn: how much more must I endure
from you? I will not listen to a prologue that can be spoken only by a
woman in breeches. And I warn you that when I raise my voice to heaven
against mummery, whether in playhouse or steeple-house, I can drown and
dumb the loudest ribald ranter.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Pastor: Mistress Gwyn is neither a ribald nor a ranter. The
plays and prologues in which she is famous are the works of the
greatest poet of the age: the poet Laureate, John Dryden.</p>

<p>FOX. If he has given to the playhouse talents that were given to him
for the service of God, his guilt is the deeper.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Have you considered, Pastor, that the playhouse is a place
where two or three are gathered together?</p>

<p>NELL. Not when I am playing, Rowley darling. Two or three hundred,
more likely.</p>

<p>FOX <i>[resuming his seat in the deepest perplexity]</i> Sir: you
are upsetting my mind. You have forced me to make friends with this
player woman; and now you would persuade me that the playhouse is as
divine as my meeting house. I find your company agreeable to me, but
very unsettling.</p>

<p>CHARLES. The settled mind stagnates, Pastor. Come! Shall I give you
a sample of Mr Dryden at his best?</p>

<p>NELL. Oh yes, Rowley darling: give us your pet speech from
Aurengzebe.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Yes yes. He speaks it beautifully. He is almost as good an
actor as King Louis; and he has really more of the grand air.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Thank you, Louise. Next time leave out the almost. My part
is more difficult than that of Louis.</p>

<p>JAMES. Pray silence for his Majesty the King, who is going to make a
fool of himself to please the Quaker.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Forgive Jamie, ladies and gentlemen. He will give you his
own favorite recitation presently; but the King comes first. Now
listen. <i>[He rises. They all rise, except Fox].</i> No, pray. My
audience must be seated. <i>[They sit down again].</i></p>

<p><i>Charles recites the pessimistic speech from Aurengzebe as
follows:</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I consider life, 'tis all a cheat;<br>
 Yet, fooled with hope, men favor the deceit;<br>
 Trust on, and think tomorrow will repay:<br>
 Tomorrow's falser than the former day;<br>
 Lies worse; and, while it says we shall be blest<br>
 With some new choice, cuts off what we possessed.<br>
 Strange cozenage! None would live past years again;<br>
 Yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain;<br>
 And from the dregs of life think to receive<br>
 What the first sprightly running could not give.<br>
 I'm tired of waiting for this chemic gold<br>
 Which fools us young, and beggars us when old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Nell and Louise applaud vigorously.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. What do you think of that, Pastor? <i>[He sits].</i></p>

<p>FOX. It is the cry of a lost soul from the bottomless blackness of
its despair. Never have I heard anything so terrible. This man has
never lived. I must seek him out and shew him the light and the
truth.</p>

<p>NELL. Tut tut, George! The man in the play is going to be killed. To
console himself he cries Sour Grapes: that is all. And now what shall I
give you?</p>

<p>JAMES. Something oldfashioned. Give him a bit of Shakespear.</p>

<p>NELL. What! That author the old actors used to talk about. Kynaston
played women in his plays. I dont know any. We cannot afford them
nowadays. They require several actors of the first quality; and--would
you believe it, George?--those laddies will not play now for less than
fifteen shillings a week.</p>

<p>FOX <i>[starting up again]</i> Fifteen shillings a week to a player
when the servants of God can scarce maintain themselves alive by
working at mechanical trades! Such wickedness will bring a black
judgment on the nation. Charles Stuart: have you no regard for your
soul that you suffer such things to be done?</p>

<p>CHARLES. You would not grudge these poor fellows their fifteen
shillings if you knew what women cost.</p>

<p>FOX. What manner of world is this that I have come into? Is virtue
unknown here, or is it despised? <i>[He gives it up, and relapses into
his seat].</i></p>

<p>JAMES. Mr Dryden has an answer for that. <i>[He recites,
seated].</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>How vain is virtue which directs our ways<br>
 Through certain danger to uncertain praise!<br>
 The world is made for the bold impious man<br>
 Who stops at nothing, seizes all he can.<br>
 Justice to merit does weak aid afford;<br>
 She trusts her balance, and ignores her sword.<br>
 Virtue is slow to take whats not her own,<br>
 And, while she long consults, the prize is gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FOX. I take no exception to this. I have too good reason to know
that it is true. But beware how you let these bold impious fellows
extinguish hope in you. Their day is short; but the inner light is
eternal.</p>

<p>JAMES. I am safe in the bosom of my Church, Pastor.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Take the gentleman's mind off his inner light, Nell. Give us
a speech.</p>

<p>NELL. They dont want a speech from me. Rowley began talking about
speeches because he wanted to do one himself. And now His Highness the
Duke of York must have his turn.</p>

<p>JAMES. Are we poor devils of princes not to have any of the good
things, nor do any of the pleasant things, because we are Royal
Highnesses? Were you not freer and happier when you sold oranges in
Drury Lane than you are now as a court lady?</p>

<p>FOX. Did you sell oranges in Drury Lane?</p>

<p>NELL. They say I did. The people like to believe I did. They love me
for it. I say nothing.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Come! Give us one of Cydara's speeches from The Indian
Emperor. It was in that that you burst on the world as the ambitious
orange girl.</p>

<p>NELL. A wretched part: I had to stand mum on the stage for hours
while the others were spouting. Mr Dryden does not understand how hard
that is. Just listen to this, the longest speech I had.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>May I believe my eyes! What do I see?<br>
 Is this her hate to him? her love to me?<br>
 'Tis in my breast she sheathes her dagger now.<br>
 False man: is this thy faith? Is this thy vow?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then somebody says something.</p>

<p>CHARLES.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What words, dear saint, are these I hear you use?<br>
 What faith? what voice? are those which you accuse?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NELL. "Those which you accuse": thats my cue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More cruel than the tiger o'er his spile<br>
 And falser than the weeping crocodile<br>
 Can you add vanity to guilt, and take<br>
 A pride to hear the conquests which you make?<br>
 Go: publish your renown: let it be said<br>
 The woman that you love you have betrayed--</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rowley darling: I cannot go on if you keep laughing at me. If only
Mr Dryden had given me some really great lines, like the ones he gave
to Montezuma. Listen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still less and less my boiling spirits flow<br>
 And I grow stiff, as cooling metals do.<br>
 Farewell, Almira.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FOX. Now do you tell me that living men and women, created by God in
His likeness and not in that of gibbering apes, can be bribed to utter
such trash, and that others will pay to hear them do it when they will
not enter a meeting house for a penny in the plate to hear the words of
God Himself? What society is this I am in? I must be dreaming that I am
in hell.</p>

<p>NELL. George: you are forgetting yourself. You should have applauded
me. I will recite no more for you. <i>[She takes a chair from the wall
and seats herself beside Louise, on her right].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. He does not understand, Nell. Tell him the story of the
play, and why Montezuma says such extravagant things.</p>

<p>NELL. But how can I, Rowley darling? I dont know what it is all
about: I know only my part and my cue. All I can say is that when
Montezuma speaks those lines he drops dead.</p>

<p>FOX. Can you wonder that he does so? I should drop dead myself if I
heard such fustian pass my lips.</p>

<p>JAMES. Is it worse than the fustian that passes the lips of the
ranters in your conventicles?</p>

<p>FOX. I cannot deny it: the preachers are a greater danger than the
players. I had not thought of this before. Again you unsettle my mind.
There is one Jeremy Collier who swears he will write such a book on the
profaneness and immorality of the stage as will either kill the theatre
or shame it into decency; but these lines just uttered by Eleanor Gwyn
are not profane and immoral: they are mad and foolish.</p>

<p>LOUISE. All the less harmful, monsieur. They are not meant to be
taken seriously; and no one takes them so. But your Huguenot ranters
pretend to be inspired; and foolish people are deluded by them. And
what sort of world would they make for us if they got the upper hand?
Can you name a single pleasure that they would leave us to make life
worth living?</p>

<p>FOX. It is not pleasure that makes life worth living. It is life
that makes pleasure worth having. And what pleasure is better than the
pleasure of holy living?</p>

<p>JAMES. I have been in Geneva, blasphemously called the City of God
under that detestable Frenchman Calvin, who, thank God, has by now
spent a century in hell. And I can testify that he left the wretched
citizens only one worldly pleasure.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Which one was that?</p>

<p>JAMES. Moneymaking.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Odsfish! that was clever of him. It is a very satisfying
pleasure, and one that lasts til death.</p>

<p>LOUISE. It does not satisfy me.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You have never experienced it, Louise. You spend money: you
do not make it. You spend ten times as much as Nelly; but you are not
ten times as happy. If you made ten times as much as she, you would
never tire of it and never ask for anything better.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Charles: if I spent one week making money or even thinking
about it instead of throwing it away with both hands all my charm would
be gone. I should become that dull thing, a plain woman. My face would
be full of brains instead of beauty. And you would send me back to
France by the next ship, as you sent Barbara.</p>

<p>CHARLES. What if I did? You will soon be tired of me; for I am an
ugly old fellow. But you would never tire of moneymaking.</p>

<p>NELL. Now the Lord be praised, my trade is one in which I can make
money without losing my good looks!</p>

<p>LOUISE <i>[to Charles]</i> If you believe what you say, why do you
not make money yourself instead of running after women?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Because there is a more amusing occupation for me.</p>

<p>LOUISE. I have not seen you practise it, Charles. What is it?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Kingcraft.</p>

<p>JAMES. Of which you have not the faintest conception.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Like Louise, you have not seen me practise it. But I am
King of England; and my head is still on my shoulders.</p>

<p>NELL. Rowley darling: you must learn to keep King Charles's head out
of your conversation. You talk too much of him.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Why is it that we always talk of my father's head and never
of my great grandmother's? She was by all accounts a pretty woman; but
the Protestants chopped her head off in spite of Elizabeth. They had
Strafford's head off in spite of my father. And then they had his own
off. I am not a bit like him; but I have more than a touch in me of my
famous grandfather Henry the Fourth of France. And he died with a
Protestant's dagger in his heart: the deadliest sort of Protestant: a
Catholic Protestant. There are such living paradoxes. They burnt the
poor wretch's hand off with the dagger in it, and then tore him to
pieces with galloping horses. But Henry lay dead all the same. The
Protestants will have you, Jamie, by hook or crook: I foresee that:
they are the real men of blood. But they shall not have me. I shall die
in my bed, and die King of England in spite of them.</p>

<p>FOX. This is not kingcraft: it is chicanery. Protestantism gives the
lie to itself: it overthrows the Roman Church and immediately builds
itself another nearer home and makes you the head of it, though it is
now plain to me that your cleverness acknowledges no Church at all. You
are right there: Churches are snares of the divvle. But why not follow
the inner light that has saved you from the Churches? Be neither
Catholic nor Protestant, Whig nor Tory: throw your crown into the
gutter and be a Friend: then all the rest shall be added to you.</p>

<p><i>They all laugh at him except Charles.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. A crown is not so easy to get rid of as you think, Pastor.
Besides, I have had enough of the gutter: I prefer Whitehall.</p>

<p>JAMES <i>[to Fox]</i> You would like to have a king for your
follower, eh?</p>

<p>FOX. I desire Friends, not followers. I am simple in my tastes. I am
not schooled and learned as you two princes are.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Thank your stars for that, Pastor: you have nothing to
unlearn.</p>

<p>FOX. That is well said. Too often have I found that a scholar is one
whose mind is choked with rubbish that should never have been put
there. But how do you come to know this? Things come to my knowledge by
the Grace of God; yet the same things have come to you who live a most
profane life and have no sign of grace at all.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You and I are mortal men, Pastor. It is not possible for us
to differ very greatly. You have to wear leather breeches lest you be
mistaken for me.</p>

<p><i>Barbara storms in with a sheet of drawing paper in her
hand.</i></p>

<p>BARBARA <i>[thrusting the paper under Charles's nose]</i> Do you see
this?</p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[scrutinizing it admiringly]</i> Splendid! Has Mr Kneller
done this? Nobody can catch a likeness as he can.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Likeness! You have bribed him to insult me. It makes me
look a hundred.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Nonsense, dear. It is you to the life. What do you say,
Jamie? <i>[He hands the drawing to James].</i></p>

<p>JAMES. It's you, duchess. He has got you, wrinkle for wrinkle.</p>

<p>BARBARA. You say this to my face! You, who have seen my portrait by
Lilly!</p>

<p>NELL. You were younger then, darling.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Who asked you for your opinion, you jealous cat?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Sit down; and dont be silly, Barbara. A woman's face does
not begin to be interesting until she is our age.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Our age! You old wreck, do you dare pretend that you are as
young as I am?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I am only fifty, Barbara. But we are both getting on.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Oh! <i>[With a scream of rage she tears the drawing to
fragments and stamps on them].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. Ah, that was wicked of you: you have destroyed a fine piece
of work. Go back to France. I tell you I am tired of your tantrums.</p>

<p><i>Barbara, intimidated, but with a defiant final stamp on the
drawing, flings away behind James to one of the chairs against the
cupboards, and sits there sulking.</i></p>

<p><i>Newton comes in from the garden, followed by Godfrey Kneller, a
Dutchman of 34, well dressed and arrogant. They are both almost as
angry as Barbara.</i></p>

<p>NEWTON. Mr Kneller: I will dispute with you no more. You do not
understand what you are talking about.</p>

<p>KNELLER. Sir: I must tell you in the presence of His Majesty you are
a most overweening, a most audacious man. You presume to teach me my
profession.</p>

<p>CHARLES. What is the matter, Mr Newton?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Let it pass, Mr Rowley. This painter has one kind of
understanding: I have another. There is only one course open to us
both; and that is silence. <i>[Finding his chair occupied by the Duke
of York he takes another from beside Barbara and seats himself at the
side of the table on the Duke's left].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. Mr Newton is our host, Mr Kneller; and he is a very eminent
philosopher. Will you not paint his picture for me? That can be done in
silence.</p>

<p>KNELLER. I will paint his picture if your Majesty so desires. He has
an interesting head: I should have drawn it this morning had not Her
Grace of Cleveland insisted on my drawing her instead. But how can an
interesting head contain no brain: that is the question.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Odsfish, man, he has the greatest brain in England.</p>

<p>KNELLER. Then he is blinded by his monstrous conceit. You shall
judge between us, sir. Am I or am I not the greatest draughtsman in
Europe?</p>

<p>CHARLES. You are certainly a very skilful draughtsman, Mr
Kneller.</p>

<p>KNELLER. Can anyone here draw a line better than I?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Nobody here can draw a line at all, except the Duchess of
Cleveland, who draws a line at nothing.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Charles--</p>

<p>CHARLES. Be quiet, Barbara. Do not presume to contradict your
King.</p>

<p>KNELLER. If there is a science of lines, do I not understand it
better than anyone?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Granted, Mr Kneller. What then?</p>

<p>KNELLER. This man here, this crazy and conceited philosopher, dares
to assert in contradiction of me, of ME! that a right line is a
straight line, and that everything that moves moves in a straight line
unless some almighty force bends it from its path. This, he says, is
the first law of motion. He lies.</p>

<p>CHARLES. And what do you say, Mr Kneller?</p>

<p>KNELLER. Sir: I do not say: I know. The right line, the line of
beauty, is a curve. My hand will not draw a straight line: I have to
stretch a chalked string on my canvas and pluck it. Will you deny that
your duchess here is as famous for her beauty as the Psyche of the
divine Raphael? Well, there is not a straight line in her body: she is
all curves.</p>

<p>BARBARA <i>[outraged, rising]</i> Decency, fellow! How dare you?</p>

<p>CHARLES. It is true, Barbara. I can testify to it.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Charles: you are obscene. The impudence! <i>[She
sits].</i></p>

<p>KNELLER. The beauty, madam. Clear your mind of filth. There is not a
line drawn by the hand of the Almighty, from the rainbow in the skies
to the house the snail carries on his back, that is not a curve, and a
curve of beauty. Your apple fell in a curve.</p>

<p>NEWTON. I explained that.</p>

<p>KNELLER. You mistake explanations for facts: all you sciencemongers
do. The path of the world curves, as you yourself have shewn; and as it
whirls on its way it would leave your apple behind if the apple fell in
a straight line. Motion in a curve is the law of nature; and the law of
nature is the law of God. Go out into your garden and throw a stone
straight if you can. Shoot an arrow from a bow, a bullet from a pistol,
a cannon ball from the mightiest cannon the King can lend you, and
though you had the strength of Hercules, and gunpowder more powerful
than the steam which hurls the stones from Etna in eruption, yet cannot
you make your arrow or your bullet fly straight to its mark.</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[terribly perturbed]</i> This man does not know what he is
saying. Take him away; and leave me in peace.</p>

<p>CHARLES. What he says calls for an answer, Mr Newton.</p>

<p>JAMES. The painter is right. A cannon ball flies across the sea in
curves like the arches of a bridge, hop, hop, hop. But what does it
matter whether it flies straight or crooked provided it hits between
wind and water?</p>

<p>NEWTON. To you, admiral, it matters nothing. To me it makes the
difference between reason and madness.</p>

<p>JAMES. How so?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Sir: if what this man believes be true, then not only is the
path of the cannon ball curved, but space is curved; time is curved;
the universe is curved.</p>

<p>KNELLER. Of course it is. Why not?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Why not! Only my life's work turned to waste, vanity, folly.
This comes of admitting strangers to break into my holy solitude with
their diabolical suggestions. But I am rightly rebuked for this vice of
mine that led me to believe that I could construct a universe with
empty figures. In future I shall do nothing but my proper work of
interpreting the scriptures. Leave me to that work and to my solitude.
<i>[Desperately, clutching his temples]</i> Begone, all of you. You
have done mischief enough for one morning.</p>

<p>CHARLES. But, Mr Newton, may we not know what we have done to move
you thus? What diabolical suggestions have we made? What mischief have
we done?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Sir: you began it, you and this infidel quaker. I have
devoted months of my life to the writing of a book--a chronology of the
world--which would have cost any other man than Isaac Newton twenty
years hard labor.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I have seen that book, and been astounded at the mental
power displayed in every page of it.</p>

<p>NEWTON. You may well have been, Mr Rowley. And now what have you and
Mr Fox done to that book? Reduced it to a monument of the folly of
Archbishop Ussher, who dated the creation of the world at four thousand
and four, B.C., and of my stupidity in assuming that he had proved his
case. My book is nonsense from beginning to end. How could I, who have
calculated that God deals in millions of miles of infinite space, be
such an utter fool as to limit eternity, which has neither beginning
nor end, to a few thousand years? But this man Fox, without education,
without calculation, without even a schoolboy's algebra, knew this when
I, who was born one of the greatest mathematicians in the world,
drudged over my silly book for months, and could not see what was
staring me in the face.</p>

<p>JAMES. Well, why howl about it? Bring out another edition and
confess that your Protestant mathematics are a delusion and a snare,
and your Protestant archbishops impostors.</p>

<p>NEWTON. You do not know the worst, sir. I have another book in hand:
one which should place me in line with Kepler, Copernicus, and Galileo
as a master astronomer, and as the completer of their celestial
systems. Can you tell me why the heavenly bodies in their eternal
motion do not move in straight lines, but always in ellipses?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I understand that this is an unsolved problem of science. I
certainly cannot solve it.</p>

<p>NEWTON. I have solved it by the discovery of a force in nature which
I call gravitation. I have accounted for all the celestial movements by
it. And now comes this painter, this ignorant dauber who, were it to
save his soul--if he has a soul--could not work out the simplest
equation, or as much as conceive an infinite series of numbers! this
fellow substitutes for my first law of motion--straight line
motion--motion in a curve.</p>

<p>JAMES. So bang goes your second volume of Protestant philosophy!
Squashed under Barbara's outlines.</p>

<p>BARBARA. I will not have my outlines discussed by men. I am not a
heathen goddess: I am a Christian lady. Charles always encourages
infidels and libertines to blaspheme. And now he encourages them to
insult me. I will not bear it.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Do not be an idiot, Barbara: Mr Kneller is paying you the
greatest compliment in taking you for a model of the universe. The
choice would seem to be between a universe of Barbara's curves and a
universe of straight lines seduced from their straightness by some
purely mathematical attraction. The facts seem to be on the side of the
painter. But in a matter of this kind can I, as founder of the Royal
Society, rank the painter as a higher authority than the
philosopher?</p>

<p>KNELLER. Your Majesty: the world must learn from its artists because
God made the world as an artist. Your philosophers steal all their
boasted discoveries from the artists; and then pretend they have
deduced them from figures which they call equations, invented for that
dishonest purpose. This man talks of Copernicus, who pretended to
discover that the earth goes round the sun instead of the sun going
round the earth. Sir: Copernicus was a painter before he became an
astronomer. He found astronomy easier. But his discovery was made by
the great Italian painter Leonardo, born twentyone years before him,
who told all his intimates that the earth is a moon of the sun.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Did he prove it?</p>

<p>KNELLER. Man: artists do not prove things. They do not need to. They
KNOW them.</p>

<p>NEWTON. This is false. Your notion of a spherical universe is
borrowed from the heathen Ptolemy, from all the magicians who believed
that the only perfect figure is the circle.</p>

<p>KNELLER. Just what such blockheads would believe. The circle is a
dead thing like a straight line: no living hand can draw it: you make
it by twirling a pair of dividers. Take a sugar loaf and cut it
slantwise, and you will get hyperbolas and parabolas, ellipses and
ovals, which Leonardo himself could not draw, but which any fool can
make with a knife and a lump of sugar. I believe in none of these
mechanical forms. The line drawn by the artist's hand, the line that
flows, that strikes, that speaks, that reveals! that is the line that
shews the divine handiwork.</p>

<p>CHARLES. So you, too, are a philosopher, Mr Kneller!</p>

<p>KNELLER. Sir: when a man has the gift of a painter, that
qualification is so magical that you cannot think of him as anything
else. Who thinks of Leonardo as an engineer? of Michael Angelo as an
inventor or a sonneteer? of me as a scholar and a philosopher? These
things are all in our day's work: they come to us without thinking.
They are trifles beside our great labor of creation and
interpretation.</p>

<p>JAMES. I had a boatswain once in my flagship who thought he knew
everything.</p>

<p>FOX. Perhaps he did. Divine grace takes many strange forms. I smell
it in this painter. I have met it in common sailors like your
boatswain. The cobbler thinks there is nothing like leather--</p>

<p>NELL. Not when you make it into breeches instead of boots,
George.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Be decent, woman. One does not mention such garments in
well-bred society.</p>

<p>NELL. Orange girls and players and such like poor folk think nothing
of mentioning them. They have to mend them, and sometimes to make them;
so they have an honest knowledge of them, and are not ashamed like fine
ladies who have only a dishonest knowledge of them.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Be quiet, Nelly; you are making Barbara blush.</p>

<p>NELL. Thats more than you have ever been able to do, Rowley
darling.</p>

<p>BARBARA. It is well for you that you have all these men to protect
you, mistress. Someday when I catch you alone I'll make you wish you
had ten pairs of leather breeches on you.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Come come! no quarrelling.</p>

<p>NELL. She began it, Rowley darling.</p>

<p>CHARLES. No matter who began it, no quarrelling, I command.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Charles: the men have been quarrelling all the morning. Does
your command apply to them too?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Their quarrels are interesting, Louise.</p>

<p>NELL. Are they? They bore me to distraction.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Much blood has been shed for them; and much more will be
after we are gone.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Oh, do not preach, Charles. Leave that to this person who
is dressed partly in leather. It is his profession: it is not
yours.</p>

<p>CHARLES. The Protestants will not let me do anything else, my dear.
But come! Mr Newton has asked us to leave his house many times. And we
must not forget that he never asked us to come into it. But I have a
duty to fulfil before we go. I must reconcile him with Mr Kneller, who
must paint his portrait to hang in the rooms of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>KNELLER. It is natural that your Majesty should desire a work of
mine for the Society. And this man's head is unusual, as one would
expect from his being a philosopher: that is, half an idiot. I trust
your Majesty was pleased with my sketch of Her Grace of Cleveland.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Your filthy caricature of Her Grace of Cleveland is under
your feet. You are walking on it.</p>

<p>KNELLER <i>[picking up a fragment and turning it over to identify
it]</i> Has the King torn up a work of mine? I leave the country this
afternoon.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I would much sooner have torn up Magna Carta. Her Grace
tore it up herself.</p>

<p>KNELLER. It is a strange fact, your Majesty, that no living man or
woman can endure his or her portrait if it tells all the truth about
them.</p>

<p>BARBARA. You lie, you miserable dauber. When our dear Peter Lilly,
who has just died, painted me as I really am, did I destroy his
portrait? But he was a great painter; and you are fit only to whitewash
unmentionable places.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Her Grace's beauty is still so famous that we are all tired
of it. She is the handsomest woman in England. She is also the
stupidest. Nelly is the wittiest: she is also the kindest. Louise is
the loveliest and cleverest. She is also a lady. I should like to have
portraits of all three as they are now, not as Lilly painted them.</p>

<p>LOUISE. No, Charles: I do not want to have the whole truth about me
handed down to posterity.</p>

<p>NELL. Same here. I prefer the orange girl.</p>

<p>KNELLER. I see I shall not succeed in England as a painter. My
master Rembrandt did not think a woman worth painting until she was
seventy.</p>

<p>NELL. Well, you shall paint me when I am seventy. In the theatre the
young ones are beginning to call me Auntie! When they call me Old Mar
Gwyn I shall be ready for you; and I shall look my very best then.</p>

<p>CHARLES. What about your portrait, Mr Fox? You have been silent too
long.</p>

<p>FOX. I am dumbfounded by this strange and ungodly talk. To you it
may seem mere gossip; but to me it is plain that this painter claims
that his hand is the hand of God.</p>

<p>KNELLER. And whose hand is it if not the hand of God? You need hands
to scratch your heads and carry food to your mouths. That is all your
hands mean to you. But the hand that can draw the images of God and
reveal the soul in them, and is inspired to do this and nothing else
even if he starves and is cast off by his father and all his family for
it: is not his hand the hand used by God, who, being a spirit without
body, parts or passions, has no hands?</p>

<p>FOX. So the men of the steeplehouse say; but they lie. Has not God a
passion for creation? Is He not all passion of that divine nature?</p>

<p>KNELLER. Sir: I do not know who you are; but I will paint your
portrait.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Bravo! We are getting on. How about your portrait, Mr
Newton?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Not by a man who lives in a curved universe. He would
distort my features.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Perhaps gravitation would distort them equally, Mr
Newton.</p>

<p>CHARLES. That is very intelligent of you, Louise.</p>

<p>BARBARA. It takes some intelligence to be both a French spy and a
bluestocking. I thank heaven for my stupidity, as you call it.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Barbara: must I throw you downstairs?</p>

<p>LOUISE. In France they call me the English spy. But this is the
first time I have been called a bluestocking. All I meant was that Mr
Kneller and Mr Newton seem to mean exactly the same thing; only one
calls it beauty and the other gravitation; so they need not quarrel.
The portrait will be the same both ways.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Can he measure beauty?</p>

<p>KNELLER. No. I can paint a woman's beauty; but I cannot measure it
in a pint pot. Beauty is immeasurable.</p>

<p>NEWTON. I can measure gravitation. Nothing exists until it is
measured. Fine words are nothing. Do you expect me to go to the Royal
Society and tell them that the orbits of a planet are curved because
painters think them prettier so? How much are they curved? This man
cannot tell you. I can. Where will they be six months hence? He cannot
tell you. I can. All he has to say is that the earth is a moon of the
sun and that the line of beauty is a curve. Can he measure the path of
the moon? Can he draw the curve?</p>

<p>KNELLER. I can draw your portrait. Can you draw mine?</p>

<p>NEWTON. Yes, with a camera obscura; and if I could find a chemical
salt sensitive to light I could fix it. Some day portraits will be made
at the street corners for sixpence apiece.</p>

<p>KNELLER. A looking glass will make your portrait for nothing. It
makes the duchess's portrait fifty times a day.</p>

<p>BARBARA. It does not. I dont look at myself in the glass fifty times
a day. Charles never passes one without looking at himself. I have
watched him.</p>

<p>CHARLES. It rebukes my vanity every time, Barbara. I am an ugly
fellow; yet I always think of myself as an Adonis.</p>

<p>LOUISE. You are not so ugly as you think, Charles. You were an ugly
baby; and your wicked mother told you so. You have never got over it.
But when I was sent to England to captivate you with my baby face, it
was you who captivated me with your seventy inches and your good
looks.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Ay, flatter him, flatter him: he loves it.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I cannot bear this. The subject is to be dropped.</p>

<p>LOUISE. But, Charles--</p>

<p>CHARLES. No, no, No. Not a word more. The King commands it.</p>

<p><i>Dead silence. They sit as if in church, except Fox, who chafes at
the silence.</i></p>

<p>FOX. In the presence of this earthly king all you great nobles
become dumb flunkeys. What will you be when the King of Kings calls you
from your graves to answer for your lives?</p>

<p>NELL. Trust you, George, to put in a cheerful word. Rowley darling:
may we all stop being dumb flunkeys and be human beings again?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Mr Rowley apologizes for his lapse into royalty. Only, the
King's person is not to be discussed.</p>

<p>LOUISE. But, Charles, I love you when you put on your royalty. My
king, Louis Quatorze, le grand monarque, le roi soleil, never puts off
his royalty for a moment even in the most ridiculous circumstances.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Yes; and he looks like a well-to-do grocer, and will never
look like anything else.</p>

<p>LOUISE. You would not dare to say so at Versailles, or even to think
so. He is always great; and his greatness makes us great also. But it
is true that he is not six feet high, and that the grand manner is not
quite natural to him. Charles can do it so much better when he chooses.
Charles: why dont you choose?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I prefer to keep the crown and the grand manner up my
sleeve until I need them. Louis and I played together when we were
boys. We know each other too well to be pleasant company; so I take
care to keep out of his way. Besides, Louise, when I make you all great
you become terrible bores. I like Nelly because nothing can make a
courtier of her. Do you know why?</p>

<p>BARBARA. Because the orange girl has the gutter in her blood.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Not at all. Tell her the reason, Nell.</p>

<p>NELL. I dont know it, Rowley darling. I never was an orange girl;
but I have the gutter in my blood all right. I think I have everything
in my blood; for when I am on the stage I can be anything you please,
orange girl or queen. Or even a man. But I dont know the reason why. So
you can tell it to her, Rowley darling, if you know it.</p>

<p>CHARLES. It is because in the theatre you are a queen. I tell you
the world is full of kings and queens and their little courts. Here is
Pastor Fox, a king in his meeting house, though his meetings are
against the law. Here is Mr Newton, a king in the new Royal Society.
Here is Godfrey Kneller: a king among painters. I can make you
duchesses and your sons dukes; but who would be mere dukes or duchesses
if they could be kings and queens?</p>

<p>NELL. Dukes will be six a penny if you make all Barbara's sons
dukes.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Oh! My sons have gentle blood in their veins, not gutter
dirt.</p>

<p>CHARLES. For shame, Nelly! It was illbred of you to reproach her
Grace for the most amiable side of her character.</p>

<p>NELL. I beg pardon. God forgive me, I am no better myself.</p>

<p>BARBARA. No better! You impudent slut.</p>

<p>NELL. Well, no worse, if you like. One little duke is enough for
me.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Change the subject, Charles. What you were saying about
little kings and queens being everywhere was very true. You are very
spiritual.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Ha ha! Ha ha ha! He spiritual!</p>

<p>LOUISE. Clever, you call it. I am always in trouble with my English.
And Charles is too lazy to learn French properly, though he lived in
France so long.</p>

<p>BARBARA. If you mean clever, he is as clever as fifty foxes.</p>

<p>FOX. He may be fifty times as clever as I; but so are many of the
blackest villains. Value him rather for his flashes of the inner light.
Did he not stop the butchering of the regicides on the ground that if
he punished them they could never punish themselves? That was what made
me his loyal subject.</p>

<p>BARBARA. I did not mean fifty of you: I meant real foxes. He is so
clever that he can always make me seem stupid when it suits him: that
is, when I want anything he wont give me. He is as stingy as a
miser.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You are like a dairymaid: you think there is no end to a
king's money. Here is my Nelly, who is more careful of my money than
she is of her own. Well, when I am dying, and all the rest of you are
forgotten, my last thought will be of Nelly.</p>

<p>NELL. Rowley darling: dont make me cry. I am not the only one.
Louise is very thoughtful about money.</p>

<p>BARBARA. Yes: she knows exactly how much he has: she gets it for him
from the King of France.</p>

<p>LOUISE. This subject of conversation is in the worst possible taste.
Charles: be a king again; and forbid it.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Nobody but Barbara would have introduced it. I forbid it
absolutely.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Basham returns.</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Mr Newton: dinner is served.</p>

<p>BARBARA. You should address yourself to His Majesty. Where are your
manners, woman?</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. In this house Mr Newton comes first. Come along quick,
all of you; or your victuals will be cold.</p>

<p>NEWTON <i>[rising]</i> Mr Kneller: will you take her Grace of
Cleveland, as you are interested in her curves?</p>

<p>BARBARA <i>[violently]</i> No. I am the senior duchess: it is my
right to be taken in by the King.</p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[rising and resignedly giving her his arm]</i> The Duke
of York will follow with the junior duchess. Happy man!</p>

<p><i>All rise, except Fox.</i></p>

<p>BARBARA. Brute! <i>[She tries to disengage herself].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[holding her fast]</i> You are on the King's arm. Behave
yourself. <i>[He takes her out forcibly].</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Now, your Highness. Now, Madam Carwell.</p>

<p>JAMES <i>[taking Louise]</i> You have remembered, I hope, that Madam
Carwell is a Catholic?</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Yes: there will be enough cod for the two of you.</p>

<p>LOUISE. Provided Charles does not get at it first. Let us hurry.
<i>[She hurries James out].</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Will you take the player woman, Mr Kneller?</p>

<p>NELL. No no. The player woman goes with her dear old Fox. <i>[She
swoops on the Quaker and drags him along]</i> George: today you will
dine with publicans and sinners. You will say grace for them.</p>

<p>FOX. You remind me that where my Master went I must follow. <i>[They
go out].</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. There is no one left for you to take in, Mr Kneller. Mr
Newton must take me in and come last.</p>

<p>KNELLER. I will go home. I cannot eat in this house of straight
lines.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. You will do nothing of the sort, Mr Kneller. There is a
cover laid for you; and the King expects you.</p>

<p>NEWTON. The lines are not straight, Mr Kneller. Gravitation bends
them. And at bottom I know no more about gravitation than you do about
beauty.</p>

<p>KNELLER. To you the universe is nothing but a clock that an almighty
clockmaker has wound up and set going for all eternity.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Shall I tell you a secret, Mr Beautymonger? The clock does
not keep time. If it did there would be no further need for the
Clockmaker. He is wiser than to leave us to our foolish selves in that
fashion. When He made a confusion of tongues to prevent the Tower of
Babel from reaching to heaven He also contrived a confusion of time to
prevent us from doing wholly without Him. The sidereal clock, the clock
of the universe, goes wrong. He has to correct it from time to time.
Can you, who know everything because you and God are both artists, tell
me what is amiss with the perihelion of Mercury?</p>

<p>KNELLER. The what?</p>

<p>NEWTON. The perihelion of Mercury.</p>

<p>KNELLER. I do not know what it is.</p>

<p>NEWTON. I do. But I do not know what is amiss with it. Not until the
world finds this out can it do without the Clockmaker in the heavens
who can set the hands back or forward, and move the stars with a touch
of His almighty finger as He watches over us in the heavens.</p>

<p>KNELLER. In the heavens! In your universe there is no heaven. You
have abolished the sky.</p>

<p>NEWTON. Ignoramus: there may be stars beyond our vision bigger than
the whole solar system. When I have perfected my telescope it will give
you your choice of a hundred heavens.</p>

<p>MRS BASHAM. Mr Kneller: your dinner will be cold; and you will be
late for grace. I cannot have any more of this ungodly talk. Down with
you to your dinner at once.</p>

<p>KNELLER. In this house, you said, Mr Newton comes first. But you
take good care that he comes last. The mistress of this and every other
house is she who cooks the dinner. <i>[He goes out].</i></p>

<p>MRS BASHAM <i>[taking Newton out]</i> Thats a funny fellow, sir. But
you really should not begin talking about the stars to people just as
they are going away quietly. It is a habit that is growing on you. What
do they know or care about the perry healing of Mercury that interests
you so much? We shall never get these people out of the house
if--<i>[They pass out of hearing].</i></p>

<p><i>There is peace in the deserted room.</i></p>

<h1><a name="a02">ACT II</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The boudoir of Catherine of Braganza, Charles's queen, in his not
too palatial quarters in Newmarket late in the afternoon on the same
day. A prie-dieu, and the pictures, which are all devotional, are signs
of the queen's piety. Charles, in slippers and breeches, shirt and
cravat, wrapped in an Indian silk dressing gown, is asleep on a couch.
His coat and boots are on the carpet where he has thrown them. His hat
and wig are on a chair with his tall walking stick. The door, opening
on a staircase landing, is near the head of the couch, between it and
the prie-dieu. There is a clock in the room.</i></p>

<p><i>Catherine, aged 42, enters. She contemplates her husband and the
untidiness he has made. With a Portuguese shake of the head (about six
times) she sets to work to put the room in order by taking up the boots
and putting them tidily at the foot of the couch. She then takes out
the coat and hangs it on the rail of the landing. Returning, she
purposely closes the door with a bang sufficient to wake
Charles.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>CHARLES. How long have I been asleep?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I not know. Why leave you your things about all over my
room? I have to put them away like a chambermaid.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Why not send for Chiffinch? It is his business to look
after my clothes.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I not wish to be troubled with Chiffinch when we are
alone.</p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[rising]</i> Belov&eacute;d: you should make me put away
my clothes myself. Why should you do chambermaid's work for me? <i>[His
"beloved" always has three syllables].</i></p>

<p>CATHERINE. I not like to see you without your wig. But I am your
wife and must put up with it.</p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[getting up]</i> I am your husband; and I count it a
great privilege. <i>[He kisses her].</i></p>

<p>CATHERINE. Yes yes; but why choose you my boudoir for your
siesta?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Here in our Newmarket lodging it is the only place where
the women cannot come after me.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. A wife is some use then, after all.</p>

<p>CHARLES. There is nobody like a wife.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I hear that Cleveland has come back from Paris. Did you
send for her?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Send for her! I had as soon send for the divvle. I finished
with Barbara long ago.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. How often have you told me that you are finished with all
women! Yet Portsmouth keeps her hold on you, and Nellie the player. And
now Cleveland comes back.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Beloved: you do not understand. These women do not keep
their hold on me: I keep my hold on them. I have a bit of news for you
about Louise. What do you think I caught her at this morning?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I had rather not guess.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Buying a love potion. That was for me. I do not make love
to her enough, it seems. I hold her because she is intelligent and
ladylike and keeps me in touch with France and the French court, to say
nothing of the money I have to extract from Louis through her.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. And Nelly? She can play the fine lady; but is she
one?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Nelly is a good creature; and she amuses me. You know,
beloved, one gets tired of court ladies and their conversation, always
the same.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. And you really did not send for Cleveland to come
back?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Beloved: when I was young I thought that there was only one
unbearable sort of woman: the one that could think of nothing but her
soul and its salvation. But in Barbara I found something worse: a woman
who thought of nothing but her body and its satisfaction, which meant
men and money. For both, Barbara is insatiable. Grab, grab, grab. When
one is done with Barbara's body--a very fine body, I admit--what is
there left?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. And you are done with Barbara's body?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Beloved: I am done with all bodies. They are all alike: all
cats are grey in the dark. It is the souls and the brains that are
different. In the end one learns to leave the body out. And then
Barbara is packed off to Paris, and is not asked back by me, though I
have no doubt there is some man in the case.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Why spend you so much time with me here--so much more
than you used to?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Beloved: do I plague you? I am off.</p>

<p><i>He makes for the door: she runs to it and bars his
egress.</i></p>

<p>CATHERINE. No: that is not what I meant. Go back and sit down.</p>

<p><i>Charles obediently goes back to the couch, where they sit side by
side.</i></p>

<p>CHARLES. And what did you mean, beloved?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. You spend too much time away from court. Your brother is
stealing the court away from you. When he is here his rooms are
crowded: yours are empty.</p>

<p>CHARLES: I thank heaven for it. The older I grow, the less I can
endure that most tiresome of all animals, the courtier. Even a
dissolute court, as they say mine is--I suppose they mean a court where
bawdy stories are told out loud instead of whispered--is more tedious
than a respectable one. They repeat themselves and repeat themselves
endlessly. And I am just as bad with my old stories about my flight
after the battle of Worcester. I told the same one twice over within an
hour last Tuesday. This morning Barbara called me an old wreck.</p>

<p>CATHERINE <i>[flaming up]</i> She dared! Send her to the Tower and
let her rot there.</p>

<p>CHARLES. She is not so important as that, beloved. Nor am I. And we
must forgive our enemies when we can afford to.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I forgive my enemies, as you well know, Charles. It is my
duty as a Catholic and a Christian. But it is not my duty to forgive
your enemies. And you never forgive mine.</p>

<p>CHARLES. An excellent family arrangement for a royal pair. We can
exchange our revenges and remain good Christians. But Barbara may be
right. When a king is shunned, and his heir is courted, his death is
not far off.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. You must not say things like that: I not can bear it. You
are stronger in your mind than ever; and nobody can keep up with you
walking.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Nevertheless, beloved, I shall drop before you do. What
will happen to you then? that is what troubles me. When I am dead you
must go back to Portugal, where your brother the king will take care of
you. You will never be safe here, because you are a Catholic queen.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I not think I shall care what becomes of me when you are
gone. But James is a Catholic. When he is king what have I to fear? Or
do you believe your son Monmouth will prevent him from succeeding you
and become a Protestant king?</p>

<p>CHARLES. No. He will try, poor boy; but Jamie will kill him. He is
his mother's son; and his mother was nothing. Then the Protestants will
kill Jamie; and the Dutch lad will see his chance and take it. He will
be king: a Protestant king. So you must make for Portugal.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. But such things not could happen. Why are you, who are
afraid of nothing else, so afraid of the Protestants?</p>

<p>CHARLES. They killed my great grandmother. They killed my father.
They would kill you if I were not a little too clever for them: they
are trying hard enough, damn them! They are great killers, these
Protestants. Jamie has just one chance. They may call in Orange Billy
before they kill him; and then it will hardly be decent for Billy to
kill his wife's father. But they will get rid of Jamie somehow; so you
must make for home the moment I have kissed you goodbye for the last
time.</p>

<p>CATHERINE <i>[almost in tears]</i> You not must talk of it--<i>[She
breaks down].</i></p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[caressing her]</i> Beloved: you will only lose the worst
of husbands.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. That is a lie: if anyone else said it I would kill her.
You are the very best husband that ever lived.</p>

<p>CHARLES <i>[laughing]</i> Oh! Oh! Oh! The merry monarch! Beloved:
can anything I can ever do make up to you for my unfaithfulness?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. People think of nothing but that, as if that were the
whole of life. What care I about your women? your concubines? your
handmaidens? the servants of your common pleasures? They have set me
free to be something more to you than they are or can ever be. You have
never been really unfaithful to me.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Yes, once, with the woman whose image as Britannia is on
every British penny, and will perhaps stay there to all eternity. And
on my honor nothing came of that: I never touched her. But she had some
magic that scattered my wits: she made me listen for a moment to those
who were always pressing me to divorce my patient wife and take a
Protestant queen. But I could never have done it, though I was furious
when she ran away from me and married Richmond.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Oh, I know, I know: it was the only time I ever was
jealous. Well, I forgive you: why should a great man like you be
satisfied with a little thing like me?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Stop. I cannot bear that. I am not a great man; and neither
are you a little woman. You have more brains and character than all the
rest of the court put together.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I am nothing except what you have made me. What did I
know when I came here? Only what the nuns teach a Portuguese princess
in their convent.</p>

<p>CHARLES. And what more had I to teach you except what I learnt when
I was running away from the battle of Worcester? And when I had learnt
that much there was an end of me as a king. I knew too much.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. With what you have taught me I shall govern Portugal if I
return to it?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I have no doubt of it, beloved; but whether that will make
you any happier I have my doubts. I wish you could govern the English
for me.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. No one can govern the English: that is why they will
never come to any good. In Portugal there is the holy Church: we know
what we believe; and we all believe the same things. But here the
Church itself is a heresy; and there are a thousand other heresies:
almost as many heresies as there are people. And if you ask any of them
what his sect believes he does not know: all he can say is that the men
of the other sects should be hanged and their women whipped through the
town at the cart's tail. But they are all against the true Church. I do
not understand the English; and I do not want to govern them.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You are Portuguese. I am Italian, French, Scottish, hardly
at all English. When I want to know how the great lump of my subjects
will take anything I tell it to Barbara. Then I tell it to Chiffinch.
Then I tell it to Jamie. When I have the responses of Barbara,
Chiffich, and Jamie, I know how Tom, Dick and Harry will take it. And
it is never as I take it.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. In Portugal we not have this strange notion that Tom,
Dick and Harry matter. What do they know about government?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Nothing; but they hate it. And nobody teaches them how
necessary it is. Instead, when we teach them anything we teach them
grammar and dead languages. What is the result? Protestantism and
parliaments instead of citizenship.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. In Portugal, God be praised, there are no Protestants and
no parliaments.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Parliaments are the very divvle. Old Noll began by thinking
the world of parliaments. Well, he tried every sort of parliament,
finishing with a veritable reign of the saints. And in the end he had
to turn them all out of doors, neck and crop, and govern through his
major-generals. And when Noll died they went back to their parliament
and made such a mess of it that they had to send for me.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Suppose there had been no you?</p>

<p>CHARLES. There is always somebody. In every nation there must be the
makings of a capable council and a capable king three or four times
over, if only we knew how to pick them. Nobody has found out how to do
it: that is why the world is so vilely governed.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. But if the rulers are of noble birth--</p>

<p>CHARLES. You mean if they are the sons of their fathers. What good
is that?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. You are king because you are the son of your father. And
you are the best of kings.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Thank you. And your brother Alfonso was king of Portugal
because he was the son of his father. Was he also the best of
kings?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Oh, he was dreadful. He was barely fit to be a stable
boy; but my brother Pedro took his crown and locked him up; and Pedro
also is my father's son.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Just so: six of one and half a dozen of the other. Heredity
is no use. Learning Latin is no use: Jack Churchill, who is an
ignoramus, is worth fifty scholars. If Orange Billy dies and one of my
nieces succeeds him Jack will be King of England.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Perhaps the Church should select the king--or the
queen.</p>

<p>CHARLES. The Church has failed over and over again to select a
decent Pope. Alexander Borgia was a jolly fellow; and I am the last man
alive to throw stones at him; but he was not a model Pope.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. My father was a great king. He fought the Spaniards and
set Portugal free from their yoke. And it was the people who chose him
and made him do it. I have sometimes wondered whether the people should
not choose their king.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Not the English people. They would choose Titus Oates. No,
beloved: the riddle of how to choose a ruler is still unanswered; and
it is the riddle of civilization. I tell you again there are in
England, or in any other country, the makings of half a dozen decent
kings and councils; but they are mostly in prison. If we only knew how
to pick them out and label them, then the people could have their
choice out of the half dozen. It may end that way, but not until we
have learnt how to pick the people who are fit to be chosen before they
are chosen. And even then the picked ones will be just those whom the
people will not choose. Who is it that said that no nation can bear
being well governed for more than three years? Old Noll found that out.
Why am I a popular king? Because I am a lazy fellow. I enjoy myself and
let the people see me doing it, and leave things as they are, though
things as they are will not bear thinking of by those who know what
they are. That is what the people like. It is what they would do if
they were kings.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. You are not lazy: I wish you were: I should see more of
you. You take a great deal too much exercise: you walk and walk and
nobody can keep up with you; you are always gardening or sailing or
building and talking to gardeners and sailors and shipwrights and
bricklayers and masons and people like that, neglecting the court. That
is how your brother gathers the court round him and takes it away from
you.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Let him. There is nothing to be learnt at court except that
a courtier's life is not a happy one. The gardeners and the watermen,
the shipwrights and bricklayers and carpenters and masons, are happier
and far far more contented. It is the worst of luck to be born a king.
Give me a skilled trade and eight or ten shillings a week, and you and
I, beloved, would pig along more happily than we have ever been able to
do as our majesties.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I not want to pig along. I was born to rule; and if the
worst comes to the worst and I have to go back to my own country I
shall shew the world that I can rule, and that I am not the ninny I am
made to look like here.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Why dont you do it, beloved? I am not worth staying
with.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I am torn ten different ways. I know that I should make
you divorce me and marry a young Protestant wife who would bring you a
son to inherit the crown and save all this killing of Monmouth and
James and the handing over of your kingdom to the Hollander. I am
tempted to do it because then I should return to my own beautiful
country and smell the Tagus instead of the dirty Thames, and rule
Portugal as my mother used to rule over the head of my worthless
brother. I should be somebody then. But I cannot bring myself to leave
you: not for all the thrones in the world. And my religion forbids me
to put a Protestant on the throne of England when the rightful heir to
it is a good Catholic.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You shall not, beloved. I will have no other widow but
you.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Ah! you can coax me so easily.</p>

<p>CHARLES. I treated you very badly when I was a young man because
young men have low tastes and think only of themselves. Besides,
odsfish! we could not talk to oneanother. The English they taught you
in Portugal was a tongue that never was spoke on land or sea; and my
Portuguese made you laugh. We must forget our foolish youth: we are
grown-up now.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Happy man! You forget so easily. But think of the
difference in our fortunes! All your hopes of being a king were cut
off: you were an exile, an outcast, a fugitive. Yet your kingdom
dropped into your mouth at last; and you have been a king since you
were old enough to use your power. But I! My mother was determined from
my birth that I should be a queen: a great queen: Queen of England.
Well, she had her way: we were married; and they call me queen. But
have I ever reigned? Am I not as much an exile and an outcast as ever
you were? I am not Catherine of England: I am Catherine of
Bragan&ccedil;a: a foreign woman with a funny name that they cannot
pronounce. Yet I have the blood of rulers in my veins and the brains of
rulers in my head.</p>

<p>CHARLES. They are no use here: the English will not be ruled; and
there is nothing they hate like brains. For brains and religion you
must go to Scotland; and Scotland is the most damnable country on
earth: never shall I forget the life they led me there with their
brains and their religion when they made me their boy king to spite Old
Noll. I sometimes think religion and brains are the curse of the world.
No, beloved, England for me, with all its absurdities!</p>

<p>CATHERINE. There can be only one true religion; and England has
fifty.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Well, the more the merrier, if only they could let
oneanother live. But they will not do even that.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Have you no conscience?</p>

<p>CHARLES. I have; and a very troublesome one too. I would give a
dukedom to any doctor that would cure me of it. But somehow it is not a
conscience of the standard British pattern.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. That is only your witty nonsense. Our consciences, which
come from God, must be all the same.</p>

<p>CHARLES. They are not. Do you think God so stupid that he could
invent only one sort of conscience?</p>

<p>CATHERINE <i>[shocked]</i> What a dreadful thing to say! I must not
listen to you.</p>

<p>CHARLES. No two consciences are the same. No two love affairs are
the same. No two marriages are the same. No two illnesses are the same.
No two children are the same. No two human beings are the same. What is
right for one is wrong for the other. Yet they cannot live together
without laws; and a law is something that obliges them all to do the
same thing.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. It may be so in England. But in Portugal the Holy Church
makes all Catholics the same. My mother ruled them though she was a
Spaniard. Why should I not do what my mother did?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Why not, indeed? I daresay you will do it very well,
beloved. The Portuguese can believe in a Church and obey a king. The
English robbed the Church and destroyed it: if a priest celebrates Mass
anywhere in England outside your private chapel he is hanged for it. My
great grandmother was a Catholic queen: rather than let her succeed to
the throne they chopped her head off. My father was a Protestant king:
they chopped his head off for trying to govern them and asking the
Midlands to pay for the navy. While the Portuguese were fighting the
Spaniards the English were fighting oneanother. You can do nothing with
the English. How often have I told you that I am no real king: that the
utmost I can do is to keep my crown on my head and my head on my
shoulders. How often have you asked me to do some big thing like
joining your Church, or some little thing like pardoning a priest or a
Quaker condemned to some cruel punishment! And you have found that
outside the court, where my smiles and my frowns count for everything,
I have no power. The perjured scoundrel, Titus Oates, steeped in
unmentionable vices, is lodged in my palace with a pension. If I could
have my way he would be lodged on the gallows. There is a preacher
named Bunyan who has written a book about the Christian life that is
being read, they tell me, all the world over; and I could not release
him from Bedford Gaol, where he rotted for years. The world will
remember Oates and Bunyan; and I shall be The Merry Monarch. No: give
me English birds and English trees, English dogs and Irish horses,
English rivers and English ships; but English men! No, NO,
<b>NO</b>.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. And Englishwomen?</p>

<p>CHARLES. Ah! there you have me, beloved. One cannot do without
women: at least I cannot. But having to manage rascals like Buckingham
and Shaftesbury, and dodgers like Halifax, is far worse than having to
manage Barbara and Louise.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. Is there really any difference? Shaftesbury is trying to
have me beheaded on Tower Hill on a charge of plotting to poison you
sworn to by Titus Oates. Barbara is quite ready to support him in
that.</p>

<p>CHARLES. No, beloved. The object of having you beheaded is to enable
me to marry a Protestant wife and have a Protestant heir. I have
pointed out to Barbara that the Protestant wife would not be so kind to
her as you are, and would have her out of the kingdom before she could
say Jack Robinson. So now she has thrown over Shaftesbury; and when I
have thrown him over, as I shall know how to do presently, there will
be an end of him. But he will be succeeded by some stupider rascal, or,
worse still, some stupid fellow who is not a rascal. The clever rascals
are all for sale; but the honest dunderheads are the very divvle.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. I wish you were not so clever.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Beloved: you could not do without my cleverness. That is
why you must go back to Portugal when I am gone.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. But it makes your mind twist about so. You are so clever
that you think you can do without religion. If only I could win you to
the Church I should die perfectly happy; and so would you.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Well, I promise you I will not die a Protestant. You must
see to that when the hour strikes for me: the last hour. So my very
belovedest will die happy; and that is all I care about. <i>[Caressing
her]</i> Does that satisfy you?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. If only I could believe it.</p>

<p>CHARLES. You mean I am the king whose word no man relies on.</p>

<p>CATHERINE. No: you are not that sort of king for me. But will it be
a real conversion? I think you would turn Turk to please me.</p>

<p>CHARLES. Faith I believe I would. But there is more in it than that.
It is not that I have too little religion in me for the Church: I have
too much, like a queer fellow I talked with this morning. <i>[The clock
strikes five].</i> Odsfish! I have a Council meeting. I must go. <i>[He
throws off his dressing gown].</i> My boots! What has become of my
boots?</p>

<p>CATHERINE. There are your boots. And wait until I make you
decent.</p>

<p><i>Whilst he pulls his boots on, she fetches his coat and valets him
into it. He snatches up his hat and stick and puts the hat on.</i></p>

<p>CATHERINE. No no: you have forgotten your wig. <i>[She takes his hat
off and fetches the wig].</i> Fancy your going into the Council Chamber
like that! Nobody would take you for King Charles the Second without
that wig. Now. <i>[She puts the wig on him; then the hat. A few final
pats and pulls complete his toilet].</i> Now you look every inch a
king. <i>[Making him a formal curtsey]</i> Your Majesty's visit has
made me very happy. Long live the King!</p>

<p>CHARLES. May the Queen live for ever!</p>

<p><i>He throws up his arm in a gallant salute and stalks out. She
rises and throws herself on her knees at her prie-dieu.</i></p>
